ABSTRACT
Historically, periods of high indebtedness have been associated with a rising incidence of default or
restructuring of public and private debts. A subtle type of debt restructuring takes the form of “financial
repression.” Financial repression includes directed lending to government by captive domestic audiences
(such as pension funds), explicit or implicit caps on interest rates, regulation of cross-border capital
movements, and (generally) a tighter connection between government and banks. In the heavily regulated
financial markets of the Bretton Woods system, several restrictions facilitated a sharp and rapid reduction
in public debt/GDP ratios from the late 1940s to the 1970s. Low nominal interest rates help reduce
debt servicing costs while a high incidence of negative real interest rates liquidates or erodes the realYDOXH
of government debt. Thus, financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied
by a steady dose of inflation. Inflation need not take market participants entirely by surprise and, in
effect, it need not be very high (by historic standards). For the advanced economies in our sample,
real interest rates were negative roughly ½ of the time during 1945-1980. For the United States and
the United Kingdom our estimates of the annual liquidation of debt via negative real interest rates
amounted on average from 3 to 4 percent of GDP a year. For Australia and Italy, which recorded higher
inflation rates, the liquidation effect was larger (around 5 percent per annum). We describe some ofWKH
regulatory measures and policy actions that characterized the heyday of the financial repressionera.

I. Introduction
“Some people will think the 2 ¾ nonmarketable bond is a
trick issue. We want to meet that head on. It is. It is an attempt to
lock up as much as possible of these longer-term issues.”
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury William
McChesney Martin Jr.
FOMC minutes, March 1-2, 1951
Remarks on the 1951 conversion of short-term
marketable US Treasury debts for 29-year nonmarketable bonds. Mr. Martin was subsequently
Chairman of the Board of Governors, 1951-1970.

The decade that preceded the outbreak of the subprime crisis in the summer of
2007 produced a record surge in private debt in many advanced economies, including the
United States. The period prior to the 2001 burst of the “tech bubble” was associated
with a marked rise in the leverage of nonfinancial corporate business; in the years 20012007, the debts of the financial industry and households reached unprecedented heights.1
The decade following the crisis may yet mark a record surge in public debt during
peacetime, at least for the advanced economies. It is not surprising that debt reduction, of
one form or another, is a topic that is receiving substantial attention in academic and
policy circles alike.2
Throughout history, debt/GDP ratios have been reduced by (i) economic growth;
(ii) a substantive fiscal adjustment/austerity plans; (iii) explicit default or restructuring of
private and/or public debt; (iv) a sudden surprise burst in inflation; and (v) a steady
1

The surge in private debt is manifest in both the gross external debt figures of the private sector (see Lane
and Milesi-Ferretti, 2010, for careful and extensive historical documentation since 1970 and Reinhart
http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~creinhar/ for a splicing of their data with the latest IMF/World Bank figures)
and domestic bank credit (as documented in Reinhart, 2010). Relative to GDP, these debt measures
reached unprecented heights during 2007-2010 in many advanced economies.
2
Among recent studies, see for example, Alesina and Ardagna (2009), IMF (2010), Lilico, Holmes and
Sabeen (2009) on debt reduction via fiscal adjustment and Sturzenegger and Zettlemeyer (2006), Reinhart
and Rogoff (2009) and sources cited therein on debt reduction through default and restructuring.

dosage of financial repression that is accompanied by an equally steady dosage of
inflation. (Financial repression is defined in Box 1) It is critical to clarify that options
(iv) and (v) are only viable for domestic-currency debts. Since these debt-reduction
channels are not necessarily mutually exclusive, historical episodes of debt reduction
have owed to a combination of more than one of these channels.3
Hoping that substantial public and private debt overhangs are resolved by growth
may be uplifting but it is not particularly practical from a policy standpoint. The
evidence, at any rate, is not particularly encouraging, as high levels of public debt appear
to be associated with lower growth.4 The effectiveness of fiscal adjustment/austerity in
reducing public debt and, particularly, their growth consequences, (which are the subject
of some considerable debate) is beyond the scope of this paper. The incidence of explicit
default or debt restructuring (or forcible debt conversions) among advanced economies
(through and including World War II episodes) and emerging markets as well as
hyperinflation as debt-reduction mechanisms is analyzed in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009
and 2011).
The aim of this paper is to document the more subtle and gradual form of debt
restructuring or “taxation” that has ocurred via financial repression (as defined in Box 1).
We show that such repression helped reduce lofty mountains of public debt in many of
the advanced economies in the decades following World War II and subsequently in
emerging markets, where financial liberalization is of more recent vintage.5 We find that

3

For instance, in analyzing external debt reduction episodes in emerging markets, Reinhart, Rogoff, and
Savastano (2003) suggest that default and debt/restructuring played a leading role in most of the episodes
they identify. However, in numerous cases the debt restructurings (often under the umbrella of IMF
programs) were accompanied by debt repayments associated with some degree of fiscal adjustment.
4
See Checherita and Rother (2010), Kumar and Woo (2010), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2010).
5
In a recent paper, Aizenman and Marion (2010) stress the important role played by inflation in reducing
U.S. World War II debts and develop a framework to highlight how the government may be tempted to

2

financial repression in combination with inflation played an important role in reducing
debts. Inflation need not take market participants entirely by surprise and, in effect, it
need not be very high (by historic standards). In effect, financial repression via controlled
interest rates, directed credit and persistent, positive inflation rates is still an effective
way of reducing domestic government debts in the world’s second largest economy-China.6
Prior to the 2007 crisis, it was deemed unlikely that advanced economies could
experience financial meltdowns of a severity to match those of the pre-World War II era;
the prospect of a sovereign default in wealthy economies was similarly unthinkable.7
Repeating that pattern, the ongoing discussion of how public debts have been reduced in
the past has focused on the role played by fiscal adjustment. It thus appears that it has
also been collectively “forgotten” that the widespread system of financial repression that
prevailed for several decades (1945-1980s) worldwide played an instrumental role in
reducing or “liquidating” the massive stocks of debt accumulated during World War II in
many of the advanced countries, United States inclusive. 8 We document this
phenomenon.
The next section discusses how previous “debt-overhang” episodes have been
resolved since 1900. There is a brief sketch of the numerous defaults, restructurings,

follow that route in the near future. However, the critical role played by financial repression (regulation) in
keeping nominal interest rates low and producing negative real interest rates was not part of their analysis.
6
Bai et. al. (1999), for example, present a framework that provides a general rationale for financial
repression as an implicit taxation of savings. They argue that when effective income-tax rates are very
uneven, as common in developing countries, raising some government revenue through mild financial
repression can be more efficient than collecting income tax only.
7
The literature and public discussion surrounding “the great moderation” attests to this benign view of the
state of the macroeconomy in the advanced economies. See, for example, McConnell and Perez-Quiros
(2000).
8
For the political economy of this point see the analysis presented in Alesina, Grilli, and Milesi Ferretti
(1993). They present a framework and stylized evidence to support it that strong governments coupled with
weak central banks may impose capital controls so as to enable them to raise more seigniorage and keep
interest rates artificially low—facilitating domestic debt reduction..

conversions (forcible and “voluntary”) that dealt with the debts of World War I and the
Great Depression. This narrative, which follows Reinhart and Rogoff (2009 and 2011),
primarily serves to highlight the substantially different route taken after World War II to
deal with the legacy of high war debts.
Section III provides a short description of the types of financial sector policies
that facilitated the liquidation of public debt. Hence, our analysis focuses importantly on
regulations affecting interest rates (with the explicit intent on keeping these low) and on
policies creating “captive” domestic audiences that would hold public debts (in part
achieved through capital controls, directed lending, and an enhanced role for
nomarketable public debts).
We also focus on the evolution of real interest rates during the era of financial
repression (1945-1980s). We show that real interest rates were significantly lower during
1945-1980 than in the freer capital markets before World War II and after financial
liberalization. This is the case irrespective of the interest rate used--whether central bank
discount, treasury bills, deposit, or lending rates and whether for advanced or emerging
markets. For the advanced economies, real ex-post interest rates were negative in about
half of the years of the financial repression era compared to less than 15 percent of time
since the early 1980s.
In Section IV, we provide a basic conceptual framework for calculating the
“financial repression tax,” or more specifically, the annual “liquidation rate” of
government debt. Alternative measures are also discussed. These exercises use a detailed
data base on a country’s public debt profile (coupon rates, maturities, composition, etc.)
from 1945 to 1980 constructed by Sbrancia (2011). This “synthetic” public debt portfolio
reflects the actual shares of debts across the different spectrum of maturities as well as
4

the shares of marketable versus nonmarketable debt (the latter involving both securitized
debt as well as direct bank loans).
Section V presents the central findings of the paper, which are estimates of the
annual “liquidation tax” as well as the incidence of liquidation years for ten countries
(Argentina, Australia, Belgium, India, Ireland, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the United
Kingdom, and the United States). For the United States and the United Kingdom, the
annual liquidation of debt via negative real interest rates amounted to 3 to 4 percent of
GDP on average per year. Such annual deficit reduction quickly accumulates (even
without any compounding) to a 30-40 percent of GDP debt reduction in the course of a
decade. For other countries, which recorded higher inflation rates the liquidation effect
was even larger. As to the incidence of liquidation years, Argentina sets the record with
negative real rates recorded every single year from 1945 to 1980.
Section VI examines the question of whether inflation rates were systematically
higher during periods of debt reduction in the context of a broader 28-country sample that
spans both the heyday of financial repression as well as the periods before and after. We
describe the algorithm used to identify the largest debt reduction episodes on a countryby-country basis and, show that in 21 of the 28 countries inflation was higher during the
larger debt reduction periods.
Finally, we discuss some of the implications of our analysis for the current debt
overhang and highlight areas for further research. There are detailed appendices which:
(i) compare our methodology to other approaches in the literature that have been used to
measure the extent of financial repression or calculate the financial repression tax; (ii)
provide country-specific details on the behavior of real interest rates across regimes; and
(iii) describe the coverage and extensive sources for the data compiled for this study.

Default,ofRestructuring
Financial Repression
The term financial repression was introduced in the literature by the works of
Shaw (1973) and Ronald McKinnon (1973). Subsequently, the term became a way of
describing emerging market financial systems prior to the widespread financial
liberalization that began in the 1980 (see Agenor and Montiel, 2008, for an excellent
discussion of the role of inflation and Giovannini and de Melo, 1993 and Easterly, 1989
for country-specific estimates). However, as we document in this paper, financial
repression was also the norm for advanced economies during the post World War II
and in varying degrees up through the 1980s. We describe here some of its main
features.
(i) Explicit or indirect caps or ceilings on interest rates, particularly (but not
exclusively) those on government debts. These interest rate ceilings could be effected
through various means including: (a) explicit government regulation (for instance,
Regulation Q in the United States prohibited banks from paying interest on demand
deposits and capped interest rates on saving deposits). (b) In many cases ceilings on
banks’ lending rates were a direct subsidy to the government in cases where the
government borrowed directly from the banks (via loans rather than securitized debt);
(c) the interest rate cap could be in the context of fixed coupon rate nonmarketable
debt; (d) or it could be maintained through central bank interest rate targets (often at the
directive of the Treasury or Ministry of Finance when central bank independence was
limited or nonexistent). Metzler’s (2003) monumental history of the Federal Reserve
(Volume I) documents the US experience in this regard; Cukierman’s (1992) classic on
central bank independence provides a broader international context.
(ii) Creation and maintenance of a captive domestic audience that facilitated
directed credit to the government. This was achieved through multiple layers of
regulations from very blunt to more subtle measures. (a) Capital account restrictions
and exchange controls orchestrated a “forced home bias” in the portfolio of financial
institutions and individuals under the Bretton Woods arrangements. (b) High reserve
requirements (usually non-remunerated) as a tax levy on banks (see Brock, 1989, for an
insightful international comparison). (c) Among more subtle measures, “prudential”
regulatory measures requiring that institutions (almost exclusively domestic ones) hold
government debts in their portfolios (pension funds have historically been a primary
target); and (d) transaction taxes on equities (see Campbell and Froot, 1994) also act to
direct investors toward government (and other) types of debt instruments. (e)
prohibitions on gold transactions.
(iii) Other common measures associated with financial repression aside from
the ones discussed above are, direct ownership (China or India) of banks or extensive
management of banks and other financial institutions (i.e. Japan). Restrictions of entry
to the financial industry and directing credit to certain industries are also features of
repressed financial markets (see Beim and Calomiris, 2000).

II. Default, Restructuring and Conversions:
Highlights from 1920s-1950s
Peaks and troughs in public debt/GDP are seldom synchronized across many
countries’ historical paths. There are, however, a few historical episodes where global
(or nearly global) developments, be it a war or a severe financial and economic crisis,
produces a synchronized surge in public debt, such as the one recorded for advanced
economies since 2008. Using the Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) database for 70 countries,
Figure 1 provides central government debt/GDP for the advanced economy and emerging
market subgroups since 1900. It is a simple arithmetic average that does not assign
weight according to country size.

1. Global debt surges and their resolution
An examination of these two series identifies a total of five peaks in world
indebtedness. Three episodes (World War I, World War II, and the Second Great
Contraction, 2008-present) are almost exclusively advanced economy debt peaks; one is
unique to emerging markets (1980s debt crisis followed by the transition economies’
collapses); and the Great Depression of the 1930s is common to both groups. World War
I and Depression debts were importantly resolved by widespread default and explicit
restructurings or predominantly forcible conversions of domestic and external debts in
both the now-advanced economies, as well as the emerging markets. Notorious
hyperinflations in Germany, Hungary and other parts of Europe violently liquidated
domestic-currency debts. Table 1 and the associated discussion provide a chronology of
these debt resolution episodes. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2009 and 2011) document, debt
reduction via default or restructuring has historically been associated with substantial

7

declines in output in the run-up to as well as during the credit event and in its immediate
aftermath.

Notes: Listed in parentheses below each debt-surge episode are the main mechanisms for debt resolution
besides fiscal austerity programs which were not implemented in any discernible synchronous pattern
across countries in any given episode. Specific default/restructuring years by country are provided in the
Reinhart-Rogoff database and a richer level of detail for 1920s-1950s (including various conversions are
listed in Table 1). The “typical” forms of financial repression measures are discussed in Box 1 and greater
detail for the core countries are provided in Table 2.

The World War II debt overhang was importantly liquidated via the combination
of financial repression and inflation, as we shall document. This was possible because
debts were predominantly domestic and denominated in domestic currencies. The robust
post-war growth also contributed importantly to debt reduction in a way that was a
marked contrast to the 1930s, during which the combined effects of deflation and output
8

collapses worked worsen the debt/GDP balance in the way stressed by Irving Fisher
(1931).
The resolution of the emerging market debt crisis involved a combination of
default or restructuring of external debts, explicit default or financial repression on
domestic debt. In several episodes, notably in Latin America, hyperinflations in the midto-late 1980s and early 1990s completed the job of significantly liquidating (at least for a
brief interlude) the remaining stock of domestic currency debt (even when such debts
were indexed, as was the case of Brazil). 9

2. Default, restructurings and forcible conversions in the 1930s
Table 1 lists the known “domestic credit events” of the Depression. Default on or
restructuring of external debt (see the extensive notes to the table) also often
accompanied the restructuring or default of the domestic debt. All the Allied
governments, with the exception of Finland, defaulted on (and remained in default
through 1939 and never repaid) their World War I debts to the United States as economic
conditions deteriorated worldwide during the 1930s.10
Thus, the high debts of the First World War and the subsequent debts associated
with the Depression of the 1930s were resolved primarily through default and
restructuring. Neither economic growth nor inflation contributed much. In effect, for all
21 now-advanced economies, the median annual inflation rate for 1930-1939 was barely

United States so as to maintain the best possible relationship.

above zero (0.4 percent). 11 Real interest rates remained high through significant
stretches of the decade.
It is important to stress that during the period after WWI the gold standard was
still in place in many countries, which meant that monetary policy was subordinated to
keep a given gold parity. In those cases, inflation was not a policy variable available to
policymakers in the same way that it was after the adoption of fiat currencies.

See Schedvin (1970) and Prichard (1970), for accounts of the Australian and New Zealand conversions,
respectively, during the Depression. Michael Reddell kindly alerted us to these episodes and references.
Alex Pollock pointed out the relevance of widespread restrictions on gold holdings in the United States and
elsewhere during the financial repression era.
Notes: We have made significant further progress in sorting out the defaults on World War I debts to the
United States, notably by European countries. In all cases these episodes are classified as a default on
external debts. However, in some case –such as the UK--some of the WWI debts to the US were also issued
under the domestic law and, as such, would also qualify as a domestic default. The external defaults on
June 15, 1934 included: Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
Latvia, Poland, United Kingdom. Only Finland made payments. See New York Times, June 15, 1934.

III. Financial Repression: policies and evidence from real interest rates

1. Selected financial regulation measures during the “era of financial repression”
One salient characteristic of financial repression is its pervasive lack of transparency.
The reams of regulations applying to domestic and cross-border financial transactions
and directives cannot be summarized by a brief description. Table 2 makes this clear by
providing a broad sense of the kinds of regulations on interest rates and cross-border and
foreign exchange transactions and how long these lasted since the end of the war in 1945.
A common element across countries “financial architecture” not brought out in Table 2 is
12

that domestic government debt played a dominant role in domestic institutions asset
holdings--notably that of pension funds. High reserve requirements, relative to the
current practice in advanced economies and many emerging markets, were also a
common way of taxing the banks not captured in our minimalist description. The
interested reader is referred to Brock (1989) and Agenor and Montiel (2008), who focus
on the role of reserve requirements and their link to inflation (see also Appendix Table
A.1.2 and accompanying discussion.)

Argentina

1977-82, 1987, and 1991-2001, Initial
liberalization in 1977 was reversed in
1982. Alfonsin government undertook
steps to deregulate the financial sector
in October 1987, some interest rates
being freed at that time. The
Convertibility Plan -March 19912001, subsequently reversed.

1977-82 and 1991-2001. Between 1976 and
1978 multiple rate system was unified,
foreign loans were permitted at market
exchange rates, and all forex transactions
were permitted up to US$ 20,000 by
September 1978. Controls on inflows and
outflows loosened over 1977-82.
Liberalization measures were reversed in
1982. Capital and exchange controls
eliminated in 1991 and reinstated on
December 2001.

Australia

1980, Deposit rate controls lifted in
1980. Most loan rate ceilings
abolished in 1985. A deposit subsidy
program for savings banks started in
1986 and ended in 1987.
1976-79 and 1989 onwards, interest
rate ceilings removed in 1976, but
reimposed in 1979. Deposit rates fully
liberalized in 1989. Some loan rates
freed in 1988. Priority sectors
continue to borrow at subsidized rates.
Separate regulation on interest rate
ceilings exists for the microfinance
sector

1983, capital and exchange controls
tightened in the late 1970's, after the move
to indirect monetary policy increased
capital inflows. Capital account liberalized
in 1983.
1984, System of comprehensive foreign
exchange controls abolished in 1984. In the
1980's most controls restricted outflows. In
the 1990's controls on inflows were
strengthened and those on outflows
loosened and (once again) in 2010.

Canada

1967, with the revision of the Bank
Act in 1967, interest rates ceilings
were abolished. Further liberalizing
measures were adopted in 1980
(allowing foreign banks entry into the
Canadian market) and 1986.

1970, mostly liberal regime.

Chile

1974 but deepens after 1984,
commercial bank rates liberalized in
1974. Some controls reimposed in

2. Real Interest Rates

One of the main goals of financial repression is to keep nominal interest rates
lower than would otherwise prevail. This effect, other things equal, reduces the
governments’ interest expenses for a given stock of debt and contributes to deficit
reduction. However, when financial repression produces negative real interest rates, this
also reduces or liquidates existing debts. It is a transfer from creditors (savers) to
borrowers (in the historical episode under study here--the government).

The financial repression tax has some interesting political-economy properties.
Unlike income, consumption, or sales taxes, the “repression” tax rate (or rates) are
determined by financial regulations and inflation performance that are opaque to the
highly politicized realm of fiscal measures. Given that deficit reduction usually involves
highly unpopular expenditure reductions and (or) tax increases of one form or another,
the relatively “stealthier” financial repression tax may be a more politically palatable
alternative to authorities faced with the need to reduce outstanding debts. As discussed in
Obstfeld and Taylor (2004) and others, liberal capital- market regulations (the
accompanying market-determined interest rates) and international capital mobility
reached their heyday prior to World War I under the umbrella of the gold standard.
World War I and the suspension of convertibility and international gold shipments it
brought, and, more generally, a variety of restrictions on cross border transactions were
the first blows to the globalization of capital. Global capital markets recovered partially
during the roaring twenties, but the Great Depression, followed by World War II, put the
final nails in the coffin of laissez faire banking. It was in this environment that the
Bretton Woods arrangement of fixed exchange rates and tightly controlled domestic and
19

international capital markets was conceived. 13 In that context, and taking into account
the major economic dislocations, scarcities, etc. which prevailed at the closure of the
second great war, we witness a combination of very low nominal interest rates and
inflationary spurts of varying degrees across the advanced economies. The obvious
result, were real interest rates--whether on treasury bills (Figure 2), central bank discount
rates (Figure 3), deposits (Figure 4) or loans (not shown)—that were markedly negative
during 1945-1946.

For the next 35 years or so, real interest rates in both advanced and emerging
economies would remain consistently lower than the eras of freer capital mobility before
and after the financial repression era. In effect, real interest rates (Figures 2-4) were, on
average negative.14 Binding interest rate ceilings on deposits (which kept real ex-post
deposit rates even more negative than real ex-post rates on treasury bills, as shown in
Figures 2 and 4) “induced” domestic savers to hold government bonds. What delayed the
emergence of leakages in the search for higher yields (apart from prevailing capital
controls) was that the incidence of negative returns on government bonds and on deposits
was (more or less) a universal phenomenon at this time15. The frequency distributions of
real rates for the period of financial repression (1945-1980) and the years following
financial liberalization (roughly 1981-2009 for the advanced economies) shown in the
three panels of Figure 5, highlight the universality of lower real interest rates prior to the
1980s and the high incidence of negative real interest rates.
13

In a framework where there are both tax collection costs and a large stock of domestic government,
Aizenman and Guidotti, (1994) show how a government can resort to capital controls (which lower
domestic interest rates relative to foreign interest rates) to reduce the costs of servicing the domestic debt.
14
Note that real interest rates were lower in a high-economic-growth period of 1945 to 1980 than in the
lower growth period 1981-2009; this is exactly the opposite of the prediction of a basic growth model and
therefore indicative of significant impediments to financial trade.
15
A comparison of the return on government bonds to that of equity during this period and its connection to
“the equity premium puzzle” can be found in Sbrancia (2011).

20

Such negative (or low) real interest rates were consistently and substantially
below the real rate of growth of GDP, this is consistent with the observation of
Elmendorf and Mankiw (1999) when they state “An important factor behind the dramatic
drop (in US public debt) between 1945 and 1975 is that the growth rate of GNP exceeded
the interest rate on government debt for most of that period.” They fail to explain why
this configuration should persist over three decades in so many countries.

Real interest rates on deposits were negative in about 60 percent of the
observations. In effect, real ex-post deposit rates were below one percent about 83
percent of the time. Appendix Table A1.1, which shows for each country average real
interest rates during the financial repression period (the dates vary, as highlighted in
Table 2, depending when interest rates were liberalized) and thereafter substantiate our
claims that low and negative real interest rates (by historical standards) were the norm
across countries with very different levels of economic development.

The preceding analysis sets the general tone of what to expect, in terms of real
rates of return on a portfolio of government debt, during the era of financial repression.
For the United States, for example, Homer and Sylla (1963) describe 1946-1981 as the
second (and longest) bear bond market in US history. 16 To reiterate the point that the
low real interest rates of the financial repression era were exceptionally low not only in
relation to the post-liberalization period but also to the more liberal financial environment
of pre-World War II, Figure 6 plots the frequency distribution of real interest rates on
deposits for the United Kingdom over three subperiods, 1880-193917, 1945-1980, 19812010.

The

preceding analysis of real interest rates despite being qualitatively suggestive

falls short of providing estimates of the magnitude of the debt-servicing savings and
outright debt liquidation that accrued to governments during this extended period. To fill
in that gap the next section outlines the methodological approach we follow to quantify
the financial repression tax, while Section V presents the main results.

26

IV. The Liquidation of Government Debt: Conceptual and Data Issues
This section discusses the data and methodology we develop to arrive at estimates
of how much debt was liquidated via a combination of low nominal interest rates and
higher inflation rates, or what we term “the liquidation effect.”18
Data requirements. Reliable estimates of the liquidation effect require
considerable data, most of which is not readily available from even the most
comprehensive electronic databases. Indeed, most of the data used in these exercises
comes from a broad variety of historical government publications, many which are quite
obscure, as detailed in the Data Appendix. The calculation of the “liquidation effect” is a
clear illustration of a case where the devil lies in the details, as the structure of
government debt varies enormously across countries and within countries over time.
Differences in coupon rates, maturity and the distribution of marketable and
nonmarketable debt, securitized debt versus loans from financial institutions, importantly
shape the overall cost of debt financing for the government. There is no “single”
government interest rate (such as a 3-month t-bill or a 10-year bond) that is appropriate
to apply to a hybrid debt stock. The starting point to come up with a measure that reflects
the true cost of debt financing is a reconstruction of the government’s debt profile over
time.
Sample. We employ two samples in our empirical analysis. We use the database
from Sbrancia (2011) of the government’s debt profiles for 10 countries (Argentina,
Australia, Belgium, India, Ireland, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and
the United States). These were constructed from primary sources over the period 19451990 where possible or over shorter intervals (determined by data availability) for a
18

Table A.1.2 and its accompanying discussion also examines other approaches to quantifying the financial
repression tax .

27

subset of the sample. For the benchmark or basic calculations (described below), this
involves data on a detailed composition of debt, including maturity, coupon rate, and
outstanding amounts by instrument. For a more comprehensive measure, which takes into
account capital gains or losses of holding government debt, bond price data are also
required. In all cases, we also use official estimates of consumer price inflation, which
at various points in history may significantly understate the true inflation rates. 19 Data on
Nominal GDP and government tax revenues are used to express the estimates of the
liquidation effect as ratios that are comparable across time and countries.
For our broader analysis of the behavior of inflation during major debt reduction
episodes, which has far less demanding data requirements (domestic public debt
outstanding/GDP and inflation rates) our sample broadens to 28 countries from all
regions for 1790-2010 (or subsamples therein). The countries and their respective
coverage are listed in Appendix Table A.1.3.

1. Benchmark basic estimates of the “liquidation effect”
The debt portfolio. We construct a “synthetic portfolio” 20 for the government’s
total debt stock at the beginning of the year (fiscal or calendar, as noted). This portfolio
reflects the actual shares of debts across the different spectrum of maturities as well as
the shares of marketable versus nonmarketable debt.

19

This is primarily due to the existence of price controls which were mainly imposed during WWII and
remained for several years after the end of the conflict. See Friedman and Schwartz (1963) for estimates of
the actual price level in the US and UK, and Wiles (1952) for post-WII U.K,
20
The term “synthetic” is used in the sense that a hypothetical investor holds the total portfolio of
government debt at the beginning of the period, which is defined as either the beginning of the calendar
year or the fiscal year, depending on how the debt data is reported by the particular country. Country
specifics are detailed in the data appendix. The weights in this hypothetical portfolio are given by the
actual shares of each component of debt in the total domestic debt of the government.

28

Interest rate on the portfolio. The “aggregate” nominal interest rate for a
particular year is the coupon rate on a particular type of debt instrument weighted by that
instrument’s share in the total stock of debt. 21 We then aggregate across all debt
instruments. The real rate of interest,
rt =

it −1 − π t
1+ π t

(where i and π are nominal interest and inflation rates, respectively) is calculated on an
ex-post basis using CPI inflation for the corresponding one-year period. It is a before-tax
real rate of return (excluding capital gains or losses). 22

A definition of debt “liquidation years.” Our benchmark calculations define a
liquidation year, as one in which the real rate of interest (as defined above) is negative
(below zero). This is a conservative definition of liquidation year; a more comprehensive
definition would include periods where the real interest rate on government debt was
below a “market” real rate.23

Savings to the government during liquidation years. This concept captures the
savings (in interest costs) to the government from having a negative real interest rate on
government debt. (As noted it is a lower bound on saving of interest costs, if the
benchmark used assumed, for example a positive real rate of, say, two or three percent.)
These savings can be thought of as having “a revenue-equivalent” for the government,
which like regular budgetary revenues can be expressed as a share of GDP or as a share

21

Giovannini and de Melo (1993) state “the choice of a "representative" interest rate on domestic liabilities
an almost impossible task and because there are no reliable breakdowns of domestic and foreign liabilities
by type of loan and interest rate charged.” This is precisely the almost impossible task we undertake here.
Their alternative methodology is described in appendix Table A.2.
22
Some of the observations on inflation are sufficiently high to make the more familiar linear version of the
Fisher equation a poor approximation.
23
However, determining what such a market rate would be in periods of pervasive financial repression
requires assumptions about whether real interest rates during that period would have comparable to the real
interest that prevailed in period when market were liberalized and prices were market determined.

29

of recorded tax revenues to provide standard measures of the “liquidation effect” across
countries and over time. The saving (or “revenue”) to the government or the “liquidation

effect” or the “financial repression tax” is the real (negative) interest rate times the “tax
base,” which is the stock of domestic government debt outstanding.

2. An alternative measure of the liquidation effect based on total returns
Thus far, our measure of the liquidation affect has been confined to savings to the
government by way of annual interest costs. However, capital losses (if bond prices fall)
may also contribute importantly to the calculus of debt liquidation over time. This is the
case because the market value of the debt will actually be lower than its face value. The
market value of government debt obviously matters for investors’ wealth but also
measures the true capitalized value of future coupon and interest payments. Moreover, a
government (or its central bank) buying back existing debt could directly and
immediately lower the par value of existing obligations. Once we take into account
potential price changes, the total nominal return or holding period return (HPR) for each
instrument is given by:
HPRt =

( Pt − Pt −1 ) + Ct
Pt −1

where Pt and Pt −1 are the prices of the bond at time t and t − 1 respectively, and C t is
the annual interest payment (i.e., the nominal coupon rate).
We use this total return measure as a supplement rather than as our core or
benchmark “liquidation measure” (despite the fact that it incorporates more information
on the performance of the bond portfolio). Bond price data are only available for a subset
of the securities that constitute the government portfolio and, more generally, consistent

30

time series price data are more difficult to get for some of the countries in our sample. It
is also worth noting that while price movements for different bonds are generally in the
same direction during a particular year, there are significant differences in the magnitudes
of the price changes. This cross-bond variation in price performance makes it difficult to
infer what the price of nonmarketable debt (for which there is no price data altogether), as
well as marketable bonds for which there is no price data. As before, we define
“liquidation years” as those periods in which the real return of the portfolio is negative. 24

3. The role of inflation and currency depreciation
The idea of governments using inflation to liquidate debt is hardly a new one
since the widespread adoption of fiat currency, as discussed earlier.25 It is obvious that
for any given nominal interest rate a higher inflation rate reduces the real interest rate on
the debt, thus increasing the odds that real interest rates become negative and the year is
classified as a “liquidation year.” Furthermore, it is also evident that for any year that is
classified as a liquidation year the higher the inflation rate (for a given coupon rate) the
higher the saving to the government.
Our approach helps to pinpoint periods (and countries) when inflation played a
systematically larger role in eroding the debts of the government. In addition, we can
disentangle to what extent this was done via relatively short-lived “inflation surprises”
(unanticipated inflation) or through a steady and chronic dose of moderate inflation over
extended time horizons. Because we do not have a direct measure of inflation
24

As described in Appendix 2, we also calculate an alternative definition of “liquidation years” by
comparing the real return of the government debt portfolio to the real return in the equity market.
According to this definition, a given year is considered a “liquidation year” if the return in a given year for
the government portfolio is below the return in the stock market; we use the most comprehensive stock
market index available for each country
25
See for example, Calvo’s (1989) framework which highlights the role of inflation in debt liquidation
even in the presence of short-term debt.

31

expectations for much of the sample, we define inflation bursts or “surprises” in a more
mechanical, ex-post manner. Specifically, we calculate a ten-year moving average for
inflation and classify those years in which inflation was more than two-standard
deviations above the 10-year average as an “inflation burst/surprise year”. As the 10-year
window may be arbitrarily too backward looking, we also perform the comparable
exercise using a five-year moving average.

V. The Liquidation of Government Debt: Empirical Estimates

This section presents estimates of the “liquidation effect” for ten advanced and
emerging economies for most of the post-World War II period. Our main interest lies in
the period prior to the process of financial liberalization that took hold during the
1980s—that is, the era of financial repression. However, as noted, this three-plus decadelong stretch is by no means uniform. The decade immediately following World War II
was characterized by a very high public debt overhang—legacy of the war, a higher
incidence of inflation, and often multiple currency practices (with huge black market
exchange rate premiums) in many advanced economies.26 The next decade (1960s) was
the heyday of the Bretton Woods system with heavily regulated domestic and foreign
exchange markets and more stable inflation rates in the advanced economies (as well as
more moderate public debt levels). The 1970s was quite distinct from the prior decades,
as leakages in financial regulations proliferated, the fixed exchange rate arrangements
under Bretton Woods among the advanced economies broke down, and inflation began to
resurface in the wake of the global oil shock and accommodative monetary policies in the

26

See De Vries (1969), Horsefield (1969), Reinhart and Rogoff (2003).

32

United States and elsewhere. To this end, we also provide estimates of the liquidation of
government debt for relevant subperiods.

1. Incidence and magnitude of the “liquidation tax”
Table 4 provides information on a country-by-country basis for the period under
study; the incidence of debt liquidation years (as defined in the preceding section); the
listing of the liquidation years; the average (negative) real interest rate during the
liquidation years; and the minimum real interest rate recorded (and the year in which that
minimum was reached). Given its notorious high and chronic inflation history coupled
with heavy-handed domestic financial regulation and capital controls during 1944-1974,
it is not surprising that Argentina tops the list. Almost all the years (97 percent) were
recorded as liquidation years, as the Argentine real ex-post interest rates were negative in
every single year during 1944-1974 except for 1953 (a just deflationary year). For India,
that share was 53 percent (slightly more than one half of the 1949-1980 observations
recorded negative real interest rates). Before reaching the conclusion that this debt
liquidation through financial repression was predominantly an emerging market
phenomenon, it is worth noting that for the United Kingdom the share of liquidation
years was about 48 percent during 1945-1980. For the United States, the world’s
financial center, a quarter of the years during that same period Treasury debt had negative
real interest rates.

As to the magnitudes of the financial repression tax (Table 4), real interest rates
were most negative for Argentina (reaching a minimum of -53 percent in 1959). The
share of domestic government debt in Argentina (and other Latin American countries) in
total (domestic plus external) public debt was substantial during 1900-1950s; it is not
33

surprising that in light of these real rates the domestic debt market all but disappeared and
capital flight marched upwards (capital controls notwithstanding). By the late 1970s
Argentina and many other chronic inflation countries were predominantly relying on
external debt.27 Italian real interest rates right after World War II were as negative as 47
percent (in 1945). For the Unites States real rates were -8 to -9 percent during 1945-1947
on average the US had -3.5 percent real rates during the liquidation years).

In 1944, the negative real return was 82.3 percent.

There are two distinct patterns in the ten-country sample evident from an
inspection of the timing of the incidence and magnitude of the negative real rates. The
first of these is the cases where the negative real rates (financial repression tax) were
most pronounced in the years following World War II (as war debts were importantly
inflated away). This pattern is most evident in Australia, the United Kingdom and the
United States, although negative real rates re-emerge following the breakdown of Bretton
Woods in 1974-1975. Then there are the cases where there is a more persistent or chronic
reliance on financial repression throughout the sample as a way of funding government
deficits and/or eroding existing government debts. The cases of Argentina and India in
the emerging markets and Ireland and Italy in the advanced economies stand out in this
regard.
The preceding analysis, as noted, adopts a very narrow, conservative calculation
of both the incidence of the “liquidation effect” or the financial repression tax. Much of
the literature on growth, as well as standard calibration exercises involving subjective
rates of time preference assume benchmark real interest rates of three percent per annum
and even higher. Thus, a threshold that only examines periods where real interest rates
were actually negative is bound to underestimate the incidence of “abnormally low” real
interest rates during the era of financial repression (approximately taken to be 19451980). To assess the incidence of more broadly defined low real interest rates, Table 5
presents for the 10 core countries the share of years where real returns on a portfolio of

35

government debt (as defined earlier) were below zero (as in Table 4), one, two, and three
percent, respectively.28

In the era of financial repression that we examine here, real ex post interest rates
on government debt did not reach three percent in a single year in the United States; in
effect in nearly 2/3 of the years real interest rates were below one percent. The incidence
of “abnormally low” real interest rates is comparable for the United Kingdom and
Australia—both countries which had sharp and relatively rapid declines in public debt to
GDP following World War II. 29 Even in countries with substantial economic and
financial volatility during this period (including Ireland, Italy and South Africa), real
interest rates on government debt above three percent were relatively rare (accounting for
only about 20-23 percent of the observations.

28

An alternative strategy would be to use a growth model to calibrate the relationship between the real
interest rate and output growth for the counterfactual of free markets. That, however, would make the
results model specific.
29
“Abnormally low” by the historical standards which include periods of liberalized financial markets
before and after 1945-1980; see Homer and Sylla’s (1963) classic book for a comprehensive and
insightful history of interest rates.

2. Estimates of the Liquidation Effect
Having documented the high incidence of “liquidation years” (even by
conservative estimates), we now calculate the magnitude of the savings to the
government (financial repression tax or liquidation effect). These estimates take “the tax
rate” (the negative real interest rate) and multiplies it by the “tax base” or the stock of
debt, Table 6 reports these estimates for each country.

The magnitudes are in all cases non-trivial, irrespective of whether we use the
benchmark measure that is exclusively based on interest rate (coupon yields) or the
alternative measure that includes capital gains (or losses) for the cases where the bond
price data is available.
For the United States and the United Kingdom the annual liquidation of debt via
negative real interest rates amounted on average from to 3 to 4 percent of GDP a year.
Obviously, annual deficit reduction of 3 to 4 percent of GDP quickly accumulates (even
without any compounding) to a 30 to 40 percent of GDP debt reduction in the course of a
decade. For Australia and Italy, which recorded higher inflation rates, the liquidation
effect was larger (around 5 percent per annum). Interestingly (but not entirely
surprising), the average annual magnitude of the liquidation effect for Argentina is about
the same as that of the US, despite the fact that the average real interest rate averaged
38

about -3.5 percent for the US and nearly -16 percent for Argentina during liquidation
years in the 1945-1980 repression era. Just as money holdings secularly shrink during
periods of high and chronic inflation, so does the domestic debt market. 30 Argentina’
“tax base” (domestic public debt) shrank steadily during this period; at the end of World
War II nearly all public debt was domestic and by the early 1980s domestic debt
accounted for less than ½ of total public debt. Without the means to liquidate external
debts, Argentina defaulted on its external obligations in 1982.
Countries like Ireland, India, Sweden and South Africa that did not experience a
massive public debt build-up during World War II recorded more modest annual savings
(but still substantive) during the heyday of financial repression.31

30

These issues are examined in Reinhart and Rogoff (2011).
It is important to note that while financial repression wound down in most of the advanced economies in
the sample by the mid 1980s, it has persisted in varying degrees in India through the present (with its
system of state-owned banks and widespread capital controls) and in Argentina (except for the years of the
“Convertibility Plan,” April 1991-December 2001).

interest service on the debt.

VI. Inflation and Debt Reduction
We have argued that inflation is most effective in liquidating government debts
(or debts in general), when interest rates are not able to respond to the rise in inflation and
in inflation expectations.32 This disconnect between nominal interest rates and inflation
can occur if: (i) the setting is one where interest rates are either administered or
predetermined (via financial repression, as described); (ii) all government debts are fixedrate and long maturities and the government has no new financing needs (even if there is
no financial repression the long maturities avoid rising interest costs that would otherwise

32

That is, the coefficient in the Fisher equation is less than one.

40

prevail if short maturity debts needed to be rolled over); and (iii) all (or nearly all) debt is
liquidated in one “surprise” inflation spike.

Our attention thus far has been confined to the first on that list, the financial
repression environment. The second scenario, where governments only have long-term,
fixed-rate debt outstanding and have no new financing needs (deficits) remain to be
identified (however, these authors have a sense such episodes are relatively rare). This
leaves the third case where debts are swiftly liquidated via an inflation spike (or perhaps
more appropriately surge). To attempt to identify potential episodes of the latter, we
conduct two simple exercises.

In the first exercise, we identify inflation “surprises” for the core ten-country
sample. In order to identify inflation surprises we calculate a 10-year moving average
inflation, and count a year as an “inflation surprise” year if the inflation during that year
is two standard deviations above the corresponding 10-year average.33 Table 8 presents
the results. The second column shows the share of years which are “inflation surprises”
during the sample period while the third shows the share of years which are both an
“inflation surprise” and a “liquidation year”.

As Table 8 highlights, there is not much overlap between debt liquidation years
and inflation surprises, as defined here. Averaging across the 10 countries, only 18
percent of the liquidation years coincide with an “inflation surprise.” In the case of South
Africa, for instance, none of the liquidation years overlap with inflation surprises. The
high incidence of inflation surprises years during the early 1970s at the time of the surge

33

The pertinent 10-year average for determining whether year t is an inflation surprise or not is calculated
over the interval t-10 to t-1.

41

in oil and commodity prices, suggests our crude methodology to identify “inflation
surprises (or spikes)” may be a reasonable approximation to the real thing. More to the
point, this exercise suggests that the role of inflation in the liquidation of debt is
predominantly of the more chronic variety coupled with financially-repressed nominal
interest rates.

Our algorithm for the second exercise begins by identifying debt-reduction
episodes and then focusing on the largest of these. Any decline in debt/GDP over a three
year window classifies as a debt-reduction episode. . For this pool of debt-reduction
episodes, we construct their frequency distribution (for each country) and focus on the
lower (ten percent) tail of the distribution to identify the “largest” three-year debt
42

reduction episodes. This algorithm biases our selection of episodes toward the more
sudden (or abrupt) ones (even if these are later reversed) which might a priori be
attributable to some combination of a booming economy, a substantive fiscal austerity
plan, or a burst in inflation/liquidation, or explicit default or restructuring. A milder but
steady debt reduction process that lasts over many years would be identified as a series of
episodes—but if the decline in debt over any particular three-year window is modest it
may not be large enough to fall in the lower ten percent of all the observations.

This exercise helps flag episodes where inflation is likely to have played a
significant role in public debt reduction but does not provide estimates of how much debt
was liquidated (as in the preceding analysis). Because we only require information on
domestic public debt/GDP and inflation, we expand our coverage to 28 countries
predominantly (but not exclusively) over 1900-2009. Thus, we are not exclusively
focusing on the period of financial repression but examining more broadly into the role of
inflation and debt reduction in the countries’ histories.

percent of all the observations.

Table 9 lists the largest debt reduction episodes by country, the last year of the 3year episode is shown and for each country; the year that appears in italics represents the
largest single-episode of debt reduction. The next two columns of the table are devoted
to the average and median inflation performance during the debt reduction episodes listed
in the second column in comparison to the inflation performance (average and median)
for the full sample (the coverage, which varies by country, is shown in Table A.2). In 22
of 28 countries, inflation is significantly higher in the episodes of debt reduction than for
the full sample. In the extreme cases, it is the wholesale liquidation of domestic debt,
such as during the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s and the long-lasting
Brazilian and Argentine hyperinflations of the early 1990s. Even without these extreme
cases, the inflation differentials between the debt reduction episodes and the full sample
are suggestive of the use of inflation (intentionally or because it became unmanageable)
to reduce (or liquidate) government debts even in periods outside the era of heavy
financial repressions. The evidence is only suggestive of this interpretation, as no
explicit causal pattern is tested.

*A debt reduction episode is defined as a decline in the domestic public debt/GDP ratio over a three-year
window. The dates shown are for the largest three-year declines recorded during the full sample period as
shown in Table A.2.
Notes: The largest annual (single-year) decline recorded in debt/GDP is shown year shown in italics under
the Dates column. For example, for Germany this was the hyperinflation year 1923; for the United States it
was 1952, the year following a substantial debt conversion (see Table 2).

Concluding Remarks
The substantial tax on financial savings imposed by the financial repression that
characterized 1945-1980 was a major factor explaining the relatively rapid reduction of
public debt in a number of the advanced economies. This fact has been largely
overlooked in the literature and discussion on debt reduction. The UK’s history offers a
pertinent illustration. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the UK’s public debt was a
staggering 260 percent of GDP; it took over 40 years to bring it down to about 100
percent (a massive reduction in an era of price stability and high capital mobility
anchored by the gold standard). Following World War II, the UK’s public debt ratio was
reduced by a comparable amount in 20 years. 34

The financial repression route taken at the creation of the Bretton Woods system
was facilitated by initial conditions after the war, which had left a legacy of pervasive
domestic and financial restrictions. Indeed, even before the outbreak of World War II,
the pendulum had begun to swing away from laissez-faire financial markets toward
heavier-handed regulation in response to the widespread financial crises of 1929-1931.
But one cannot help thinking that part of the design principle of the Bretton Woods
system was to make it easier to work down massive debt burdens. The legacy of
financial crisis made it easier to package those policies as prudential.

To deal with the current debt overhang, similar policies to those documented here
may re-emerge in the guise of prudential regulation rather than under the politically
incorrect label of financial repression. Moreover, the process where debts are being
34

Peak debt/GDP was 260.6 in 1819 and 237.9 percent in 1947. Real GDP growth was about the same
during the two debt reduction periods (1819-1859) and (1947-1967), averaging about 2.5 percent per
annum (the comparison is not exact as continuous GDP data begins in 1830). As such, higher growth
cannot obviously account for the by far faster debt reduction following World War II.

46

“placed” at below market interest rates in pension funds and other more captive domestic
financial institutions is already under way in several countries in Europe. There are many
bankrupt (or nearly so) pension plans at the state level in the United States that bear
scrutiny (in addition to the substantive unfunded liabilities at the federal level).

Markets for government bonds are increasingly populated by nonmarket players,
notably central banks of the United States, Europe and many of the largest emerging
markets, calling into question what the information content of bond prices are relatively
to their underlying risk profile. This decoupling between interest rates and risk is a
common feature of financially repressed systems. With public and private external debts
at record highs, many advanced economies are increasingly looking inward for public
debt placements.

While to state that initial conditions on the extent of global integration are vastly
different at the outset of Bretton Woods in 1946 and today is an understatement, the
direction of regulatory changes have many common features. The incentives to reduce
the debt overhang are more compelling today than about half a century ago. After World
War II, the overhang was limited to public debt (as the private sector had painfully
deleveraged through the 1930s and the war); at present, the debt overhang many
advanced economies face encompasses (in varying degrees) households, firms, financial
institutions and governments.

(2008)

Measure(s) of financial

End-of-year effective reserve
requirements ratios are calculated
(see entry under Brock). The
authors calculate how important a
share of seignorage is accounted
for by the reserve requirement tax.

Sample and coverage
32 advanced and
emerging market

Beim and
Calomiris
(2001)

Six measures (real interest rates,
reserve ratio, liquidity, private
borrowing, bank lending, and stock
market capitalization) of financial
repression are used to construct an
aggregate index. Their aim is to
provide a broad-brush crosscountry comparison at a particular
point in time—not a “tax
equivalent” to the government.

Brock (1989)

End-of-year effective reserve
requirements ratios are calculated
as base money less currency in
circulation (central bank reserves)
divided broad money (or money
plus quasi-money). Looks at the
correlation between inflation rates
and the reserve ratio.

source) as the difference between
domestic rates and comparable

by the end-of-period stock of
deposits (the tax base).

All countries, advanced
and emerging-data
permitting. The most
comprehensive coverage
is for 1997. The annual
indices are reported for
1970 and for 1990 for a
subset of countries. The
period of heaviest
repression 1945-early
1970s is not part of the
analysis.
41 advanced and
emerging market
economies 1960-1984.

Highlight of findings
Reserve ratios are higher
for emerging markets.
Among the advanced
economies the highest
share of seignorage
accounted for by reserve
ratios is Italy over this
period. For the emerging
markets, Chile and Peru
have the highest
readings.
Based on the crosssectional evidence, the
authors conclude that
financial development
(the opposite of
repression) contributes
importantly to economic
development and
growth.

Reserve ratios are higher
for emerging markets.
Among the advanced
economies these are
highest for Australia and
Italy over this period. A
positive relationship
between inflation and
reserve requirements is
mostly present in the
chronic high inflation
countries of Africa and
Latin America.
Estimates are highest for
Mexico and Yugoslavia
among the 12 countries,
reaching 12-16 percent
of GDP in some years.

This component of the
financial repression tax
is in the order of 1-2
percent of GDP.

Giovannini
and de Melo
(1993)

The effective interest rate on
external (domestic) debt are
calculated as the ratio of external
(domestic) interest payments to the
stock of external (domestic) debt.
The government revenue from
financial repression is calculated
by computing the differential
between the foreign borrowing cost
and the domestic borrowing cost,
times the average annual stock of
domestic debt.

Roughly 1974-1987
(usually shorter period),
depending on the
country. The 24developing-country
sample does include
Greece and Portugal as
emerging markets.

Annual estimates of the
“revenue from financial
repression” are
estimated from a low of
0.5 percent of GDP for
Zaire (with its small
domestic debt market to
a high of about 6 percent
for Mexico.
Estimates for Greece
and Portugal are 2-2.5
percent of GDP.

Table A1.2 sketches the approach, sample and findings of six papers that have in
different ways attempted to quantify some of the dimensions of financial repression.
While Beim and Calomiris (2001) primarily aim to rank a cross section of countries at a
point (or two) in time to link the measures extent of financial repression to growth and
development, the remaining papers do attempt to quantify some of the financial
repression “revenue” equivalents. For instance, the papers dealing with reserve
requirements capture the tax on financial institutions. Ultimately, (as Reinhart and
Reinhart, 1999 document) the banks pass this tax on to depositors (via lower deposit
rates), non-government borrowers (via higher lending rates) or both, depending who has
the most access to alternatives. If households are barred from holding foreign assets
and/or gold (see Table 2), lower deposits are tolerated more readily. If domestic banks
are the only game in town for the firms—they will have to live with the higher lending
rates.
The Giovannini and deMelo (1993) paper is closest in spirit to our fundamental
two-part intertwined question (i) what is the annual saving on interest payments domestic
debt? (ii) what the magnitude of the erosion or liquidation on the existing stock of debt
55

due to negative real interest rates. Giovannini and de Melo (1993) compare “effective
interest rates” on external debt to the potentially repressed “effective interest rates on
domestic debt” (See Table A1.2). This is a natural exercise for emerging markets (the
focus of their analysis) for the period that they consider (1974-1987), as emerging market
governments were funding themselves through both domestic and external borrowing (in
varying degrees), as documented by Reinhart and Rogoff (2011). The market-determined
interest rate on external debt is a logical benchmark under such circumstances. However,
there are two compelling reasons why this approach is neither feasible nor desirable for
our purposes. First, some countries (like the United States and the Netherlands) do not
have and have not had historically external debt.35 All government debts are issued under
domestic law and in the domestic currency, irrespective of whether the holders of the
debt are domestic pension funds or foreign central banks. Second, most emerging
markets had little or no external debt during the heyday of the financial repression era
during Bretton Woods (1945-1973); the depression of the 1930s and the subsequent
world war had all but eradicated global debt markets.

Apart from a trivial amount of Carter-bonds in the 1970s the US debt is domestic (homogenous) whether
it is held by residents or nonresidents
