JEL No. H23,H42,K11,O33,O34
ABSTRACT
This paper explores the characteristics of 238 patents on 94 “inventions” contributed by major multinational
innovators to the “Eco-Patent Commons”, which provides royalty-free access to third parties to patented
climate change related innovations. By comparing the pledged patents to other patents in the same
technologies or held by the same multinationals, we investigate the motives of the contributing firms
as well as the potential for such commons to encourage innovation and diffusion of climate change
related technologies. This study, therefore, indirectly provides evidence on the role of patents in the
development and diffusion of green technologies. More generally, the paper sheds light on the performance
of hybrid forms of knowledge management that combine open innovation and patenting.

Introduction

Numerous well-known economists have called for policies to encourage both public and
private investment in technologies designed to mitigate climate change (Mowery et al.
2010; David et al. 2009; Krugman 2009; Arrow et al. 2008). As Nordhaus (2009), among
others, points out, policy in this area confronts a double externality problem: the first is
private underinvestment in R&D due to partial lack of appropriability and imperfections in
the financial markets and the second is the fact that climate change mitigation and
reduction in greenhouse gases is a classical public good, and one with a substantial
international component. That is, the benefits of climate change mitigation flow largely to
those who do not bear the costs. Hall and Helmers (2010) argue that the existence of the
second externality can impact the desirability of policies designed to deal with the first
externality, shifting policy makers’ preferences towards subsidies and away from
intellectual property (IP) protection.
To make this argument more explicit, consider the usual policies designed to close the gap
between the private and social returns to an activity.4 These are subsidizing (or issuing tax
credits for) the activity, regulating the activity (mandating its performance or controlling
the price of inputs), and internalizing the externality by granting property rights that allow
some appropriation of the social benefits. In the case of R&D investment, the first approach
has been widely used in the past for research directed towards national needs (Mowery,
2010), for corporate R&D via tax credits, and for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) that face credit constraints. Although the second approach has been used much less
(and is probably less suitable for R&D activities due to their uncertainty and the difficulty
of such micro-management), examples are the mandate of the State of California for sales of
electric-powered automobiles (Kemp, 2005) and the U.S. federal government stimulus
package, which mandates the diffusion of electronic medical records and their effective use
(Blumenthal, 2009).
The most widely available policy designed to encourage private R&D investment in most
countries is the intellectual property system. However, in the case of climate change
mitigation (as in the case of R&D directed toward other national needs), allowing firms to
appropriate social benefits via their market power and pricing behavior has the drawback
that without further policy design, it will tend to inhibit the diffusion of the technologies
whose creation it encourages. In addition to the welfare cost of limited diffusion, IP
protection also has potential negative consequences for subsequent innovation that builds
4

We note in passing that in the case of climate change, formidable incomplete information problems and the global
nature of needed policies make the simple “market failure” analysis and corresponding policy predictions not as
useful as they might be in other areas. However, the question of the proper role of IP protection in the case of
climate change-related technologies still remains.

on the protected technologies. Given the environmental externality, such diffusion and
follow-on innovation is highly desirable. This has triggered an active debate on the role and
usefulness of IPRs in the generation of climate change related innovation and its diffusion.5
The existing evidence suggests that the IP system, specifically the patent system, may not
be the optimal policy to encourage R&D in this area.
A number of large multinational firms such as Sony, IBM, Nokia, etc., appear to have
recognized the problem with patents in the area of climate change related technologies and
as a response, have created an “Eco-Patent Commons” (henceforth EcoPC) together with
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (http://www.wbcsd.org). Firms
pledging patents to this commons are required to sign a non-assertion pledge which allows
third parties royalty-free access to the protected technologies. The official purpose of this
private initiative is described on the EcoPC website as the following:
•

•

To provide an avenue by which innovations and solutions may be easily shared to
accelerate and facilitate implementation to protect the environment and perhaps
lead to further innovation.
To promote and encourage cooperation and collaboration between businesses that
pledge patents and potential users to foster further joint innovations and the
advancement and development of solutions that benefit the environment.

Obviously, one can imagine an additional purpose: to improve the reputation and public
relations of the participating firms, possibly by contributing patents on inventions of little
value and the donation, therefore, generating little cost to the firm. Alternatively, the
patents contributed could be those on inventions that need development effort that the
firms in question are not willing to undertake. To date, there are 12 participating firms, and
121 patents have been contributed to the commons.6 Relative to the size of these firms’
patent portfolios, this is a small number; however, it could be large given the small share of
directly climate-change related patents in these firms’ total patenting.7

5

For a review of the relevant literature see Hall and Helmers (2010).

More precisely, the EcoPC website lists 121 patent numbers. These 121 patent numbers correspond to 90
equivalent groups containing 94 unique priorities, and the total number of equivalent patents is 238. Precise
definitions of these are given later in the paper. The firms that have contributed to date are Bosch, Dow,
DuPont, Fuji-Xerox, IBM, Mannesmann, Nokia, Pitney Bowes, Ricoh, Sony, Taisei and Xerox. Note that the
patent owned by Mannesmann was absorbed and pledged by Bosch, but we nevertheless treat Mannesmann
as a separate entity in our analysis. The EcoPC announced on July 1 2010 that Hewlett Packard (HP) has
joined the commons. Yet, we omit HP in our analysis as our core data predates HP’s entry into the commons.
6

In fact, the 94 unique priorities accounted for by these patents are 0.02 percent of the priorities claimed by
these firms between 1989 and 2005. The share ranges from 0.12 percent for DuPont to negligible for Ricoh,
Sony, Nokia, and FujiXerox.

The question that we ask is whether the EcoPC initiative achieves its ambitious official
objectives. In order to provide an answer to this broad question, we answer a range of
intermediate questions: (a) are the patented technologies indeed climate-change related?
(b) Are the patents that protect these technologies valuable? (c) Will royalty-free access to
the EcoPC patents lead to more diffusion of the protected technologies and the generation
of sequential innovations than otherwise? In particular question (c) is interesting in light of
the broader debate on the role of IP in the diffusion of climate-change related technologies.
The EcoPC initiative provides a unique opportunity to study what happens to technology
diffusion if valid patent protection is effectively removed from the pledged technologies.
The question of whether the EcoPC scheme achieves its objectives is directly linked to
firms’ underlying motivations to pledge their patents to the EcoPC. As will be explained in
detail in Section 2, firms maintain ownership of their pledged patents, which implies that
they have to bear the recurrent costs associated with patent ownership in the form of
renewal fees. It is, therefore, far from obvious which benefits accrue to firms from the
EcoPC scheme that outweigh the direct (e.g., renewal fees) and indirect (e.g., management
time) financial costs associated with keeping pledged patents in force. Therefore,
understanding firms’ motives to pledge and keep patents in force sheds light on the
effectiveness and sustainability of the commons as a hybrid form of appropriation in
addressing both the knowledge and environmental externalities involved in climate change
related innovation.
To answer these questions, the present paper explores the characteristics of the patents
that have been contributed to the EcoPC and compares them to two other sets of patents:
1) patents held by the pledging firms that are not donated to the commons and 2) a
randomly drawn set of patents in the same technology (which also share priority year and
authority with EcoPC patents). The first comparison sheds light on the question of where
these patents fit in the firms’ patent portfolios and hence give some indication on firms’
underlying motivations to pledge these patents. Whereas the second informs us about how
the value of these patents compares with other patents that protect similar technologies
and that have not been donated to the commons. This comparison also provides
information on the impact of the commons on technology diffusion and its potential to
induce follow-on innovation by third parties.
However, given the short amount of time the EcoPC has been in place, some of the answers
will be of tentative nature; we nevertheless believe that a detailed study of the pledged
patents will provide insights into the open innovation-patenting relationship in the climate
change technology area, insights that may also be useful in other areas where open
innovation exists side-by-side with IP protection. In particular, we provide insights into the
ability of such hybrid private initiatives to address the double externality problem present
in climate change related innovation.

We begin the paper with a discussion of the history and detailed operation of the ecopatent commons. Section 3 describes the data used in our analysis. Section 4 reviews
different theoretical motivations for firms to pledge their climate change related patents.
Section 5 provides a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the EcoPC patents and
Section 6 discusses the corresponding regression results. Section 7 discusses our approach
to investigating the effect of the non-assertion pledge on technology diffusion and
innovation and shows the results of our analysis. Section 8 concludes.

2.

The Eco-Patent Commons

The creation of the not-for-profit initiative EcoPC is quite recent, in January 2008. It was
established by IBM in cooperation with the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD) and it allows companies to pledge patents that protect green
technologies. Companies as well as individuals can join the commons by pledging at least
one patent.8 Any patent is welcome that protects a technology that confers directly or
indirectly some environmental benefit – so-called green patents. “Green” is defined by a
classification listing IPC subclasses that are considered to describe environmentally
friendly technologies. Yet, there appears to exist considerable flexibility as long as a
pledging firm can show some (direct or indirect) environmental benefit of the pledged
patent. In fact, as we show later, many of the patents contributed appear to be directed
towards mitigating environmental damage from manufacturing, but not specifically
towards climate change mitigation.
“Pledge” in this context means making patents available for use by third parties free of
charge,9 although the ownership right remains with the pledging party which distinguishes
the EcoPC from conventional patent commons. This also implies that the non-assertion
pledge cannot be treated as a patent donation and hence the pledged patent is not
deductable from a company’s taxable income. Potential users do not have to specifically
request a license; any pledged patent is automatically licensed royalty-free provided it is
used in a product or process that produces some environmental benefit.
While a pledge is in principle irrevocable,10 there is a built-in mechanism to safeguard a
pledging firm’s business interests which is called “defensive termination”. This means that
According to the “Ground Rules”
(http://www.wbcsd.org/web/projects/ecopatent/EcoPatentGroundRules.pdf), also “any worldwide
counterparts” to the pledged patent are considered to be subject to the non-assertion pledge, i.e., any
equivalents to the pledged patent.

Third parties comprise anyone interested in the patented technology and not only other firms that are part of the
commons.
The “Ground Rules” (http://www.wbcsd.org/web/projects/ecopatent/EcoPatentGroundRules.pdf)
stipulate that “[a] patent approved for inclusion on the Patent List cannot be removed from the Patent List,

10

Hall-Helmers

a pledging firm can “terminate” the non-assertion pledge if a third party that uses a pledged
patent asserts its own patent against the pledging company. The possibility to invoke
“defensive termination” does not apply to other pledging firms in the commons unless the
primary IPC of the asserted patent is on the commons IPC classification list. The fact that
companies retain ownership rights also means that they have to bear the cost of
maintaining the IP right, that is, they must pay any fees required to keep the patent in
force.11
The initial members of the commons when it was launched in January 2008 were IBM,
Nokia, Pitney Bowes, and Sony. In September 2008, Bosch, DuPont, and Xerox joined. Ricoh
and Taisei entered the commons in March 2009 and Dow Chemical and Fuji-Xerox in
October 2009. Its newest member, Hewlett Packard (HP) joined in July 2010, but is
excluded from our analysis because our core data are as of April 2010 and thus predate
HP’s entry into the commons. All patents pledged to the EcoPC are listed in an online database (the data base is reproduced in Appendix A1).
The EcoPC is currently the only initiative of this type, although Creative Commons in
collaboration with Nike and Best Buy is setting up the Green Xchange initiative. In this new
initiative (in contrast to the EcoPC), pledging firms can choose whether to charge a fixed
annual fee for the use of a pledged patent. Contributing firms can also selectively deny
other firms the use of a pledged patent. In addition, registration of users of contributed
patents is mandatory. As a matter for future research, it would be interesting to investigate
whether the difference in institutional design of the Green Xchange has any effect on the
achievement of the objective that both commons share.
To reiterate the official objective of the EcoPC laid out in the Introduction: the EcoPC aims
to promote the sharing of climate-change related technologies and thus to assist in
environmental protection for the common good. The initiative targets green patents that
are neither used nor represent “an essential source of business advantage” to their owners.
except that it may be deleted for so long as the patent is not enforceable.” However, firms obviously can
withdraw from the commons at any point in time, although even in this case “[v]oluntary or involuntary
withdrawal [from the commons] shall not affect the non-assert as to any approved pledged patent(s) the nonassert survives and remains in force.”
11

When a patent is applied for at the EPO, renewal fees must be paid to the EPO beginning the third year counted
from the date of filing until the patent is granted. Once the patent has been granted, renewal fees have to be paid to
the national offices separately in which the patent has been validated. Renewal fees at the EPO currently vary
between EUR 420 and EUR 1,420 depending on how long the application has been pending (see Supplement 1 to
OJ EPO 3/2010). Renewal fees in national offices vary substantially, as of August 2010, for example in the UK, fees
increase during the 20 years of patent validity from GBP 70 to GBP 600, whereas in Germany, fees increase from
EUR 70 to EUR 1,940. Maintenance of a patent family can thus be quite costly if annual fees have to be paid at
several patent offices. Contrary to the EPO and European national offices, at the USPTO, renewal fees are not
payable annually. At 3.5 years, the maintenance fees due amount to US$ 980, at 7.5 years to US$ 2,480 and at 11.5
years to US$ 4,110.

Hence, the commons does not ask firms to sacrifice patents of particular business value for
the common good. It should, therefore, attract those patents that are neither “worked” nor
confer a strategic value to the company even as a “dormant” property right (see also
Section 4). The initiative endeavors to emphasize potential business benefits for firms from
participating in the commons: it can serve as a way of diffusing a technology and
potentially lead to new collaboration and business opportunities. But most importantly,
participation in the scheme guarantees broad public visibility considering the great deal of
(mostly positive) attention in the press the initiative has received so far (NY Times 31
October 2009; Wall Street Journal 14 January 2008; WIPO Magazine April 2009) and
innumerable postings and discussions in blogs and climate-change/open-innovation online
forums.
However, a number of these press articles and blog postings contest the value of the
initiative. For example, the Wall Street Journal (14 Januray 2008) notes that the
environmental benefit is not obvious for some of the EcoPC patents. As a case in point, the
press article provides the example of a patent pledged by Pitney Bowes “that protects
electronic scales from being damaged when they are overloaded.”12 In a review of the
EcoPC initiative, Srinivas (2008) lists a number of problems with the initiative. He asserts
that the technologies protected so far by patents in the EcoPC “have a very limited
application in the further development of technologies in key sectors.” However, he does
not provide any proof for this assertion. Related to this, he claims that more important
players in the market for climate-change related technologies have to join the commons in
order to make it an effective tool for the dissemination of relevant technologies. He is also
skeptical that simply providing royalty-free access to single green patents will have a
significant impact on the diffusion of green technologies as most technologies are covered
by multiple patents which are not included in the commons. Cronin (2008) argues in her
article in Greenbiz13 that the patents contained in the EcoPC are of little value as they
protect outdated technologies. She also asks the natural question of why private companies
would give something valuable away for free. In order to make the EcoPC more valuable,
Cronin suggests that it should include novel non-patented inventions that have not been
made public before, presumably because they were protected via (trade) secrecy. This
could be done inexpensively in the form of defensive publications, which are currently not
part of the EcoPC.
However, the issue is even more puzzling, because firms actually pay to provide royaltyfree access to their patents. As pointed out by Bucknell (2008) in an article for Think IP
12

This patent is a bit of an exception. It seems that overload is likely to cause damage to the load cell, a core
component of highly sensitive and accurate electronic scales. The invention, therefore, avoids the need for frequent
replacement of the load cell and hence helps avoiding environmental waste.

Strategy,14 firms could instead allow a patent to lapse by simply not paying renewal fees
and to communicate to the public that the main motivation for doing so is to allow third
parties access to the invention and hence to spur its diffusion. The relevant question,
therefore, is why firms would find it worthwhile to offer non-exclusive royalty-free licenses
to a set of patents while simultaneously incurring the cost of keeping them in force? Why
not simply allow the patents to lapse, effectively publishing the contents defensively? Is the
value of possible defensive termination against future threats that large?
In the academic literature, so far, only Van Hoorebeek and Onzivu (2010) discuss the EcoPC
initiative. They regard it as a private response to calls by mostly developing countries for
increased climate change related technology transfer. As such, the EcoPC initiative may
help deflect increasing pressure exerted by developing countries to apply TRIPS provisions
including compulsory licensing or even denying patent protection to specific climate
change related to technologies. But for this strategy to be viable, patents pledged under the
EcoPC initiative should protect enforceable and “valuable” technologies, an assumption
that Van Hoorebeek and Onzivu (2010) do not investigate in their qualitative discussion.
More generally, there has been some discussion in the strategic management literature on
patent pledges in the context of software. Alexey and Reitzig (2010), for example, argue
that firms may choose to pledge patents to mould the wider appropriability regime that
governs their business activity. Using software patents as an example, the authors argue
that firms which stand to profit from the open source software concept through the
production of complementary assets, such as IBM and Nokia, choose to unilaterally pledge
patents in order to create an appropriability regime conducive to the open source
movement. The establishment of a patent commons would seem consistent with this
reasoning as it would enable firms to address the collective action problem involved in
shifting the appropriability regime. Since the EcoPC firms are not major players in the
market for green technologies, shifting the appropriability regime governing green
technologies might thus even be beneficial as it could harm potential competitors and
induce sales of complementary assets provided by EcoPC firms. Nevertheless, the
assumption underlying this argument is again that firms pledge “valuable” patents.
Biotechnology, a research field in which IP protection of key technologies appears to have
detrimental effects on innovation (Lei et al., 2009), offers another example of a similar
initiative: the BiOS (Biological Open Source) initiative by the not-for-profit institute
CAMBIA. In the case of BiOS, firms may use patented technologies royalty-free but agree to
“share with all BiOS licensees any improvements to the core technologies as defined, for
which they seek any IP protection” and “agree not to assert over other BiOS licensees their
own or third-party rights that might dominate the defined technologies” (Jefferson, 2006:
14

459). The strength of this initiative appears to rest largely on the value of the IP rights
available under BiOS licenses.
In summary, the EcoPC initiative provides an institutional design that allows easy access to
patented technologies, which may confer some direct or indirect climate change related
benefits. It is, however, far from obvious whether the pledged patents protect any valuable
green technologies as the motives for firms to pledge valuable green patents and keep them
in force are not clear-cut.

Data

The data appendix A describes in detail how we created our EcoPC dataset and control
samples. We started with the list of 121 patents contributed to the EcoPC by the 12
contributing firms which is available on WBCSD’s website.15 We then used the April 2010
edition of EPO’s PATSTAT to draw the following samples of patents:
1. All of the patents with the same set of priority documents as the EcoPC patents,
i.e., all EcoPC equivalents.16
2. Control (1) sample: all patent applications worldwide that were made by the 12
EcoPC firms.
3. Control (2) sample: all patent applications worldwide in the same IPC class as
one of the EcoPC patents (which also share the same priority year and authority
as an EcoPC patent). In addition, we restrict this sample to patents applied for by
firms (i.e., not by individuals/public research institutions).
A number of complications arose in performing these tasks. First, PATSTAT is based on
published applications, whether or not the patents have been granted. This is an advantage
because most of our EcoPC patents are of fairly recent date and may not yet have been
granted. However, not all US applications are published at 18 months, especially in the
earlier part of our sample. Even if they are published, it appears that some firms leave the
assignment of ownership off the application until the patent issues, so we will not find all
the patent applications that correspond to a given firm. When we use a matched control
sample later in the paper (Section 7), this is no longer a problem because in that case we
are able to verify the owner(s) manually.

15

Some of the patent numbers given on WBCSD’s website were incorrect. We retrieved the correct numbers either
by searching for the patents using the patent titles indicated on the website or by obtaining the information directly
from contacting WBCSD. We thank Kana Watanabe at IBM’s Corporate Environmental Affairs for assisting in the
retrieval of the missing information.
16

The priority years range from 1989 to 2005, so we restricted the matching samples Control (1) and Control (2) to
those years.

A second problem is missing priorities. Many of these patents have multiple equivalents,
which are patents applied for in several jurisdictions on the same invention. We prefer to
perform our analysis using only a single observation for each “invention,” preferably the
priority application. However a large number of patents are missing priorities and in this
case we simply allowed the patent to serve as its own priority. This may mean that we
effectively keep the patent as a single patent with no equivalents. We have checked this
assumption using the equivalents data constructed by Dietmar Harhoff and co-workers and
found that it introduces very little error into the data.17
A related problem is that some applications have multiple priorities and some patents
serve as priority patents for multiple applications to the same authority, making the
assignment of a unique priority application to each application problematic. Although these
problems afflict only a minority of applications, they do exist for a subset of our EcoPC
patents. For example, US priority patent application 57503704 from 2004 serves as a
priority patent for 9 US patent applications. Of these 9 applications, 2 have an additional 4
priority patents at the USPTO in 2004, and 7 have one additional priority patent, also at the
USPTO in 2004. Not surprisingly, the assignee for all these patents is DuPont Corporation, a
chemicals firm: the pattern of multiple interlocking priorities is much more common in
chemicals than elsewhere. Our solution to this problem is to define an invention as an
equivalent group of patents and to use the earliest priority application as the priority
patent.18 In the case described above, there are two groups, one consisting of the first 2
applications, which share a common priority set (US 2004 53681904, 54997804,
57503704, 58478504, and 53745304), and one consisting of the second 7, which also share
a common priority set (US 2004 57503704 and 58478504). Thus although there are 94
unique priorities among the eco-patents, there are only 90 unique equivalent groups. Table
1 shows the various counts for both the EcoPC patent and the control samples.
Ideally we would like to study these patents at the level of unique inventions, i.e., priorities.
However, owing to the missing priority problem identified above and the overlapping
priorities which implies that families, i.e., equivalent groups, are the correct unit of analysis
(and introduces a new problem of identifying a unique priority patent for each family), we
are not able to do this. In the analysis that follows, we choose to solve this problem by
occasionally presenting results that use all 238 of the EcoPC patents, but weights the
observations by the inverse of the equivalent group or family size, effectively down-

All the additional equivalents for our EcoPC patents that were found this way were for unpublished patent
applications, which are not in our sample. See http://www.inno-tec.bwl.unimuenchen.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte/patent_cit_project/index.html for the equivalents data.

Appendix A2 for more details.

weighting those patents that have many incarnations. We also cluster the standard errors
by equivalence group, to allow for within-group correlation of the errors.
Finally, PATSTAT´s April 2010 version does not provide information on the legal status of a
patent. It can be inferred from a patent’s publication kind code whether it has been
granted; however, if a patent has not been granted, it is difficult to infer whether the patent
application has been rejected, lapsed, or is simply still pending. Moreover, there is no
information on whether renewal fees have been paid. This made it necessary to collect
information on patents’ legal status manually from EPO’s INPADOC, USPTO PAIR, and the
various national patent offices (see data appendix A).

Which patents do firms pledge?

Figure 1 shows schematically the decision tree of a firm contemplating “working” a patent
or abandoning it and its decision to pledge the patent to the EcoPC.

Figure 1: Firm’s decision tree

Unfortunately, we only observe some of these decisions. Among the four final outcomes (a no patent, b - work the patent, c - pledge the patent, d - neither work nor pledge the patent),
we observe only c and the combination of b and d. This limits our ability to build a
structural model of the decision process. Conditional on patenting, we can, however,
conjecture the following based on our discussion in Section 2:
1. The firm is more likely to work the patent if it is valuable to the firm, if more
resources were invested in acquiring it, and if it is related to the firm’s own line of
business or technology expertise.

Hall-Helmers

12

2. The firm is more likely to pledge a patent if it is environmentally friendly, if it is less
related to the firm’s own line of business or technology expertise, and if it is not
suitable for licensing.
Taken together, this suggests that a firm’s pledged patents will be less valuable to the firm,
more “green”, and less related to the firm’s patent portfolio. We might also expect that
these patents are less likely to be prosecuted aggressively if they have not yet issued, and
that they are less likely to remain in force. If firms (ab)use the commons purely for public
relation motives, we would expect to see pledged patents to lapse, i.e., not to be in force,
shortly after entering the EcoPC because presumably most PR benefits are reaped at the
moment when the pledge is announced.
Hence, while a firm’s decision to `work’ a patent remains unobserved, we can nevertheless
deduce from the characteristics of the pledged patents themselves (notably their legal
status) as well as relative to other patents held by the same firm or patents in the same
technology field what a firm’s underlying motives for pledging patents are and hence what
type of patent from a firm’s patent portfolio is pledged.

Descriptive Statistics

In this section of the paper we present some basic information about the patents
contributed to the commons: their ages, legal status, priority authorities, family sizes, the
technology areas, and the firms contributing. In combination with the regression analysis
in Section 6, this allows us to address the first two questions posed in the introduction: are
the patented technologies indeed climate-change related? Are the patents that protect
these technologies valuable?
Table 1 shows a breakdown of the composition of the different samples. It shows that we
have 238 unique patent applications in the EcoPC, which correspond to 94 unique
inventions/priorities. The table displays also the corresponding figures for the two control
samples. Table 2 shows the number of patents contributed by each of the 12 firms. The first
panel shows all the patents and their equivalents, a total of 238 patent applications, and the
second panel shows the unique 90 equivalence groups that correspond to these patents.
Table 2 shows that the donated patents are a tiny share of the firms’ portfolios (less than
0.1 per cent) and that the majority of the patent families (76 out of 90, or 84 per cent) have
been contributed by just four firms: Bosch, DuPont, IBM, and Xerox. In appendix Table A3
we show that in almost all cases the priority patent was applied for at the USPTO, the
German patent office, or the JPO, and in most cases at the office corresponding to the
headquarters of the applicant. Table 2 also shows the date that each firm entered the
commons; to the best of our knowledge this is also the date that all their patents were

contributed. The dates are all quite recent, so we have only two to three years to observe
these patents after donation, with the inevitable consequence that our analysis will be
preliminary, but we believe it is useful to set the stage for subsequent analysis performed
after some more time has passed.
Table 3 gives a rough idea of the technologies that have been contributed. This table is
based on a reading of the abstract and written description of these patents, with a special
focus on the description of the problem to be solved, in order to determine their likely
application. Two related observations about the data in this table suggest themselves: first,
only slightly more than one-third of these patents fall into classes that are designated as a
clean technology class by the OECD-EPO definition (Johnstone et al., 2010).19 Second, many
of them seem to be related to environmental cleanup or clean manufacturing, and only
tangentially to mitigating the effects of global climate change.20
The ages of the contributed patents at the time of their donation vary widely. A few are old
and nearing the end of their life, but many have substantial statutory life remaining (Figure
2). Age is measured as the exact date the owning firm joined the commons less the exact
priority date of the patent. In general, the statutory life of the patents will be twenty years
from the date of application (which often coincides with the priority date), and we find a
range from 3 years to 20 years, with a peak at 4 years of age. This is suggestive, as most
patents are granted by the time the application is four years old, and this age also
corresponds roughly to the time when some uncertainty about potential value of the
invention is likely to have been resolved (Lanjouw et al., 1998).21 In Figure 3, we show the
priority year distribution of the contributions as a share of the 12 firms’ patents (Control 1
sample) and also as a share of patents in the relevant IPC classes (Control 2 sample). Both
are roughly flat but with high variability, and an observable increase in contribution rates
in the years 2004 and 2005.
One of the questions raised in Section 2 was whether and why firms would pay to keep a
patent in force once it was contributed to the commons. Because many of the donations are
quite recent, it is difficult to observe whether firms have chosen to pay renewal fees on
their patents after they have been donated. It is also the case that many of these patents
have not even been granted as of February/March 2011. In Table 4, we look at the legal
19

There is one patent for which we could not ascertain the environmental benefit. The patent is entitled `Image
Forming Device’ and has the objective ` [t]o prevent a user from getting into a dangerous situation caused by fault
and breakage due to use exceeding the working limit of a cartridge.’
EPO patents typically take longer to grant than four years, but are relatively underrepresented in our
sample, which consists primarily of USPTO, German patent office, and JPO patent applications and grants.

status of all the equivalent patents where we have collected the data manually from the
relevant patent offices as described above (as of February/March 2011). It appears that
almost half of these patents have been granted and are still in force, 2.5 per cent are
pending, and 40 per cent are withdrawn, rejected by the relevant office, lapsed or have
expired.22 Looking at the weighted shares, 64 per cent are in force, about 2 per cent are
pending, and 28 per cent are not in force. So in fact it does appear that in some cases the
applicants have chosen to abandon the donated patents before their statutory term has
expired, or have chosen not to prosecute them aggressively. However, the difference in the
weighted results suggests that in many cases, at least one of the equivalents is still in
force.23 Additional information is shown in Table A4 in the Appendix, which provides a
breakdown of the data by pledging company. Table 5 shows that the firms are more likely
to maintain the patents in the US, Germany, or at the EPO, and less likely in other
jurisdictions. Table 5 also shows the legal status of a matched control sample of patents in
the same technology classes as the EcoPC patents which is discussed in more detail in
Section 7. The comparison confirms that USPTO patents are far more likely to be
maintained in force than patents from other jurisdictions. It also shows that the share of
patents in force is considerably larger for the EcoPC sample, 70 per cent of the priorities
pertaining to unique equivalent groups are still in force relative to 38 per cent in the
control sample.
The descriptive statistics provided in this section suggest that a substantial share of EcoPC
patents have been granted and are maintained in force. In any case, most patents that enter
the commons are young and most of their statutory lifetime remains. The technologies
covered by the EcoPC patents appear to be climate change related, although this is a matter
of interpretation as the OECD clean technology definition categorizes only a third of the
EcoPC patents as climate change related. We also showed that the EcoPC patents account
for tiny shares in EcoPC firms’ patent portfolios. Considering the size of the patent
portfolios held by firms such as IBM or Sony, this is hardly a surprising result.

Characteristics of donated patents

In this section of the paper, we take a look at the characteristics of the EcoPC patents and
compare them to our two control samples, first using univariate analysis and then via

As best we can determine, the NA category corresponds to those patent applications that have not yet been
examined by the relevant office, either because they are newer, or, in some cases, because examination was
not requested by the applicant. The patent offices concerned are Japan, Russia, and Mexico.

In fact, 16 of the 90 equivalence groups have no patent that is still in force, 56 have one such patent, and 18 have
more than one.

multivariate probit regressions. The characteristics we look at are the usual bibliometric
statistics available in patent data:
•

•
•
•
•
•

The number of inventors listed on the application, which is related to the amount of
resources invested in the invention. This variable is occasionally missing from
PATSTAT, and we add a missing value dummy when that is the case.
The family size as given by DOCDB, which is a proxy for the value of the invention.
The number of citations received worldwide by April 2010, another proxy for value,
and for diffusion.
The number of references to other patents, which may be related to the extent to
which this invention is derivative of others.
The number of references to the non-patent literature, a proxy for closeness to
science.
The number of IPCs in which the patent has been classified, sometimes used as a
proxy for the scope or breadth of the invention.

We also include a dummy that indicates whether the patent falls in one of the OECD green
technology patent classes (Johnstone et al. 2010). Finally, when comparing our patents to
the others held by the contributing firms, we include a measure of their similarity to the
other patents in the firm’s portfolio. This measure is the sum of the relative frequency of a
patent’s IPC codes in the firm’s portfolio. It ranges from zero to 0.79; higher values
correspond to higher similarity.
Table 6 shows the means, standard deviations, minima, and maxima of these variables for
the EcoPC patents and the two control samples. The table also shows a simple t-test for
differences in the means, and a nonparametric ranksum test for differences in the
distributions of each variable across the samples. Compared to the other patent
applications by these firms (Control 1 sample), EcoPC patents have more inventors, a
larger family size, more backward citations, more non-patent references, are classified in
more IPCs, and are much more likely to fall in the OECD green technology classes (not
surprisingly). However, they have the same pattern of forward citations, suggesting that
the knowledge they contain is not diffusing faster than that of the patents retained by the
firms. They are also clearly more distant from the firm’s portfolio than the other patents.
Compared to patents in the same classes (Control 2 sample), however, the EcoPC patents
have smaller family sizes, but more forward and backward citations. They are also
classified in many fewer IPCs, suggesting that they are narrower than other patents in
these classes.
Table 7 takes a multivariate look at the difference between EcoPC patents and the other
patents applied for by the 12 EcoPC firms. This table shows the results of a probit
regression for the probability that a patent is an EcoPC patent as a function of the patent

characteristics, the priority year, dummies for the one-digit IPC, and dummies for the four
leading firms (Bosch, DuPont, IBM, and Xerox). The standard errors for these regressions
are grouped by equivalence group, and we also present the same regressions weighted by
the inverse of the group size for comparison. The results are quite similar. The EcoPC
patents are clearly more likely to be green-tech patents and to be far from the firm’s
portfolio of technologies. They also have a larger family size, suggesting that they were
viewed as more valuable by the firm at the time of application. Finally, they have more
backward citations which suggests either that they are somewhat derivative, or that they
are in a crowded technological field.
Table 8 performs a similar exercise using the second control sample, patents in the same
IPCs as the EcoPC patents, i.e., comparing patents protecting in principle similar
technologies. For this probit regression, weighting by the size of the patent family does
make a difference. The unweighted results are similar to those for the first control sample:
EcoPC patents have more backward citations, fewer IPCs and are more likely to be green.
The weighted regression also suggests that they are more valuable than a random patent
from the class, with more inventors and a larger family size.
The following section investigates whether pledging the property rights has had a
discernible impact on the diffusion of the protected technologies.

7.

Technology Diffusion and Follow-on Innovation

The descriptive statistics and the regression analysis described in Sections 5 and 6 above
suggest that EcoPC patents protect relatively valuable, climate change related technologies.
The ensuing question is whether pledging these patents has had an impact on the diffusion
of the protected technologies and has spurred the development of new innovation which is
based on the pledged patents.

Empirical Approach
There are at least two challenges in assessing the effect of the commons on diffusion and
innovation. First, diffusion in terms of application of the protected technologies in question
cannot be captured. According to the rules of the EcoPC, third parties are allowed to use
pledged patents without signaling this to the patent owners. Hence, if a third party applies
an EcoPC patent in a process or product, we are unable to observe this unless the third
party cites the EcoPC patent in a patent application aimed at protecting the new process or
product. It is important to emphasize that this may substantially undermine our ability to
investigate the impact of the non-assertion pledge on pure diffusion without additional
innovation for which patent protection is sought. Second, we observe patents for at most
three years after they have been pledged, which is a relatively short amount of time that

Hall-Helmers

17

June 2011

the inventions protected by these patents have been freely accessible. Considering the
possible long lag time in the development of new technologies based on existing patents
and the common 18 month period between application and publication date, this may limit
our ability to find patents that build on the EcoPC patents after they have entered the
commons. To mitigate this problem, we have augmented the PATSTAT April 2010 citation
data with data manually collected from Espacenet as of February 2011.
Mindful of these limitations imposed by data availability, we resort to a difference-indifference type research design to investigate the question of diffusion. We observe all
patents before and after they have been pledged and therefore analyze whether there are
statistically significant differences in the pattern of forward citations these patents receive
before and after they entered the commons. If royalty-free access has had an impact on
diffusion of these technologies, we would expect to see a statistically significant increase in
the forward citations that the EcoPC patents have received subsequent to their pledge. As a
control group, we use the set of patents in the same technology classes as the EcoPC
patents. The unit of observation is therefore cites per patent per citation lag, where the lag
is measured by the number of years between the priority dates of the citing patent and the
cited patent. Most of the values of this variable are quite small (about 80 per cent are zero)
so we use Poisson regression with standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and
clustered on the patent for estimation.
The model that we estimate is specified as follows:
௖

ߣ ೔೟ ݁ ఒ೔೟
ܿ௜௧ ~ ௜௧
ܿ௜௧ !

ߣ௜௧ = ݁‫ ݌ݔ‬ቆ

ߙ௜௣ + [1 − ૚ሺ‫ܥܲ݋ܿܧ‬௜ ሻ] × ߜሺ‫ݐ‬ሻ × [1 + ߤ × ૚ሺ‫߬ ≥ ݐ‬௜ ሻ]
ቇ
+૚ሺ‫ܥܲ݋ܿܧ‬௜ ሻ × ߛሺ‫ݐ‬ሻ × [1 + ߩ × ૚ሺ‫߬ ≥ ݐ‬௜ ሻ]

‫ = ݐ‬1, … , 17

where cit is the number of citations received by patent i at citation lag t, i.e., the difference
between a patent’s priority date and the priority date of the citing patent, and αip are a set
of dummies for the patent priority date (between 1989 and 2005).24 The dummy variable
૚ሺ‫ܥܲ݋ܿܧ‬௜ ሻ is equal to one for EcoPC patents and zero for the control patents. We control
for the citation lag distribution for the two samples separately using quadratics in the lag:

f (t ) = f 0 + f1t + f 2t 2

f = δ ,γ

The δ and γ functions allow the overall shape of the citation lag distribution to differ
between EcoPC patents and the controls. Finally, the dummy variable ૚ሺ‫߬ ≥ ݐ‬௜ ሻ is equal to
24

These dummies are included to allow for the fact that there is lag truncation, so some lags have fewer cites simply
because there are fewer patents old enough to have cites with that lag.

one after the establishment of the commons, i.e., when patents are pledged to the EcoPC.25
The effect of entry into the EcoPC is thus captured by the semi-elasticity ρ, which gives the
average per cent change in forward citations following entry in the commons.
So the ߩ coefficients inform us about the “pledge effect” in terms of forward citations. The
main problem with estimating this model is that the dummy variable ‫ܥܲ݋ܿܧ‬௜௧ is unlikely to
be strictly exogenous. For example, if more forward citations made it less likely for a patent
to be pledged to the EcoPC, the assumption of exogeneity of the right hand side variables
would be violated and our estimate of the “pledge effect” biased. In future, we might be able
to correct for this problem using the results in the previous section on the characteristics of
pledged patents relative to the firms’ overall patent portfolios and a control function
approach to estimating the Poisson regression.

Citation data and regressions
The citation data used for the regressions that follow are constructed by collecting all the
forward citation records for the EcoPC patents and their controls including cites to their
equivalents from Espacenet (as of February 2011). For this part of the analysis, we draw a
subsample from our Control 2 sample to match the sample of EcoPCs as closely as possible
based on patents’ priority year, publication authority and IPC codes. The subsample,
therefore, provides a set of control patents that is closest to the EcoPC patents in terms of
the type of protected technology, the age of a patent, and in which jurisdiction/market it
protects an invention. Moreover, the reduced sample size allows us to rely on the most
recent available citation data from Espacenet, which has to be collected individually for
each patent record from the Espacenet website.
In the analysis below we use two versions of the citation data thus created: the first is by
patent application including the equivalents (238 EcoPC patents and 473 controls) and the
second is by the family or set of equivalents (90 EcoPC and 94 controls). We verified that
we do not double count citations by checking the equivalent sets of citing patents. For
example if patents A and B cite patent C, we verify that A and B are not equivalents. Before
doing analysis on the second dataset we collapse the citations within each equivalence
group, to avoid double counting them. That is, if the equivalence group contains patent A,
cited by patent C, and patent B in the same equivalence group is also cited by patent C, this
yields only one citation, from C to the group (A, B).
Table 9 shows the number of patents and equivalent groups that receive any citations
during the 1989-2010 period as well as the total number of citations received. The table
shows that nearly 35 per cent of EcoPC patents received any forward citation whereas only
25

Obviously we do not have such a date for the controls, so we have used the date of the establishment of the EcoPC
(2008) for them.

25 per cent of the patents in the control sample did. If the unit of analysis is an equivalence
group, the pattern changes: the shares of EcoPC and control equivalent groups that receive
any citations are nearly the same with 70 and 68 per cent respectively. This change reflects
the simple fact that EcoPC patent applications have fewer equivalents and are therefore
more likely to be the cited application. Table 9 also shows average citations for both
groups. The figures reveal that the EcoPC patents have on average more citations when we
look at all patents, but have fewer citations when the unit of analysis is the equivalence
group, for the same reason as above.
Appendix Table A5 shows the distribution of average citations received by citation lag.
Citation lags are defined as the difference between the priority dates of the citing and the
cited patent. This measure can be interpreted as the age of the patented technology at the
point in time it was cited. The first panel of Table A5 shows the distribution of citation lags
using a patent as the unit of analysis as opposed to an equivalence group as shown in the
second panel of Table A5. The distribution of citation lags ranges from 0 to 17 where this
range differs by patent according to its priority date.
In the first panel, Columns (1)-(3) show the number of average citations for each citation
lag for both EcoPC and control patents. As should be expected, the average citation counts
drop considerably as the lag size increases, which means that patents receive on average
less citations the older they are. The citation lag distribution of the EcoPC sample appears
to be skewed to the right relative to the control sample, i.e., average citation counts are
larger for low citation lags with the largest differences for citation lags of 2-4 years. Nonparametric (ranksum and Kruskal-Wallis) tests also strongly reject the null hypothesis of
equal citation lag distributions. Columns (4) and (5) show the average citations before and
after patents have been pledged to the commons, which makes clear that there are few
forward citations after patents have been pledged.
Table 10 shows the results of the Poisson regressions for citations as a function of the
priority year, citation lag and EcoPC patent status (the first column is by equivalent group
and the second by patent). Both reach similar conclusions. Note that in both cases the
parameter μ, which measures the post-2008 effect for the control sample, was
insignificantly different from zero, suggesting that there is no overall change to the cite lag
distributions after 2008, so we imposed μ=0 in the results shown. Although the controls
and the eco-patents have significantly different citation lag distributions overall, the postentry effect for the eco-patents is insignificantly different from zero in both columns. Figure
4 visualizes the different citation distributions for the control and EcoPC samples. The
figure shows that the forward citation distributions are indeed very similar for the EcoPC
and control patents. For both groups, the average number of cites drops considerably over
time with there being very few cites after the establishment of the commons, so we can
conclude that the data are insufficient at the present time to answer the question, although

Hall-Helmers

as time passes and more citations are received by both sets of patents it will be interesting
to look at this question again.

8.

Conclusions

Are firms dumping valueless patents without any apparent applicability in mitigating
climate change into the commons only to reap good publicity? Or is royalty-free access to,
in fact, valuable and green patents a promising way to promote the diffusion of climatechange related technologies?
Our answer to the first question is a qualified `No’. Pledged patents appear to be climatechange related, albeit more in form of environmental cleanup or clean manufacturing.
Judging by some indicators of a patent’s value, such as family size, the EcoPC patents are
more valuable than the average patent held by pledging firms and comparable patents
protecting similar technologies. However, they tend to be more derivative of previous
technologies and somewhat narrower than other patents in their class, suggesting that they
are not for very radical inventions. Because they are usually distant from the firm’s
technology (patent) portfolio, one reason for donating them maybe that they are not very
valuable to the firm holding them. In spite of this, pledging firms also appear to maintain at
least one patent of a patent family in force after it has been pledged by paying the renewal
fees.
However, our answer to the second question regarding the commons’ potential to enhance
diffusion of the protected technologies is even less conclusive. Our analysis suggests that
pledging these patents, that is making them available to third parties royalty-free, has no
discernible impact on the diffusion of the knowledge embedded in the protected
technologies to other patenting firms. However, given the short period of time after the
patents have been pledged that is available so far, our results are naturally of preliminary
nature but invite further scrutiny in the near future.

Notes:
1) Corrected numbers in italic red.
2) Underlined numbers in green added by the authors to list available on EcoPC website.
3) Data on equivalents extracted from Espacenet (http://ep.espacenet.com)

A 2: Construction of core dataset
The patent numbers given in Column 3 of Table A 1 are used to extract additional
information on these Eco-Patent Commons (EcoPC) patents from the European Patent
Office (EPO) Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) version April 2010.
PATSTAT combines patent information from several sources: DocDB (the EPO master
bibliographic database containing abstracts and citations), PRS (the patent register for
legal data), EPASYS (the database for EP patent grant procedure data), and the EPO patent
register as well as the USPTO patent database for names and addresses of applicants and
inventors.
In a first step, we extract from Espacenet all equivalents of the patent numbers given in
Column 3 of Table A 1. In a second step, we retrieve from PATSTAT all patents with the
same publication number as an EcoPC patent. In a third step, we also match the publication
authority and keep the record in PATSTAT that is at the most advanced stage of the grant
process as indicated by its publication kind. For example in the case of the US, if both A1
(first published patent application) and B1 (granted patent as first publication) documents
are available,26 we focus on the B1 document.

26

These definitions apply since 2001.

We then add a range of information covering the application, publication, IPC codes,
applicant and inventor, priorities, and patent families as defined in DOCDB and INPADOC
(for more information on patent families see Martinez, 2010). We also create a variable
that marks patents that belong to the same set of equivalents. Our algorithm assigns
patents into the same equivalent group if patents share exactly the same priority
documents.27 We also include backward and forward citations as well as citations of nonpatent documents. Since forward citations are truncated by the PATSTAT version that we
use, we collect in addition the most recent forward citations from Espacenet.28 We face the
same issue in determining whether an EcoPC has been granted. Thus, we also collect the
most recent available publication kind from Espacenet in order to create an indicator
variable showing whether a patent has been granted. In addition, we collect manually
information on the legal status (as of February/March 2011) of EcoPC patents from a
various sources, including INPADOC, IPDL, KIPRIS, DPinfo, INPI, and USPTO PAIR.29

27

We also assign patents to the same equivalent set that display the following patterns:

A 3: Construction of comparison sample 1 (patents from same applicant)
We use a list of standardized firm names of companies that have pledged patents to the
EcoPC to extract all other patents assigned to these firms from PATSTAT. Notably, we first
extracted all assignee names available in PATSTAT and then filtered the nearly 37 million
entries for the names of our EcoPC firms. This approach ensured that we caught all patents
held by our firms regardless of the different ways in which firms names are entered into
PATSTAT – we found that for some of our firms, PATSTAT included several hundred
different ways in which the names are entered. We extract the same range of information
on these control patents as for the core EcoPC patents except for their legal status (see
description in A 2).

A 4: Construction of comparison sample 2 (patents with same (i) priority
authority, (ii) priority year, and (iii) IPC)
The second control group is selected based on a unique list of (i) priority authority, (ii)
priority year, and (iii) IPC of the EcoPC patents. This list is used to extract from PATSTAT
all other patents (and their equivalents) which share features (i)-(iii) with the EcoPC
patents. In a second step, we eliminated manually all individual and non-profit assignees
from the control sample. We extract the same range of information on these control patents
as for the core EcoPC patents including their legal status (see description in A 2).
