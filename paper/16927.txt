The Psychological Costs of War: Military Combat and Mental Health

NBER Working Paper No. 16927
April 2011
JEL No. H56,I1
ABSTRACT
While descriptive evidence suggests that deployment in the Global War on Terrorism is associated
with adverse mental health, the causal effect of combat is not well established. Using data drawn from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we exploit exogenous variation in deployment
assignment and find that soldiers deployed to combat zones where they engage in frequent enemy
firefight or witness allied or civilian deaths are at substantially increased risk for suicidal ideation,
psychological counseling, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our estimates imply lower-bound
health care costs of $1.5 to $2.7 billion for combat-induced PTSD.

"This is the price of war….You can't send young Americans to Iraq and Afghanistan ...
and expect them to come home and just fit right in. They bring that trauma with them."
-Max Cleland, Vietnam War Veteran and former U.S. Senator
I. Introduction
The mental health impairments experienced by U.S. soldiers deployed in the Global War
on Terrorism (GWOT) have received a great deal of attention by both policymakers and the
American news media. A recent article in the Time magazine describes the mental health
problems of servicemen and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan as “the U.S. Army’s
third front” (Thompson, 2010). Military service has been linked to greater take-up of disability
benefits among some veterans (Autor et al., 2011; Angrist et al., 2010), as well as higher rates of
crime and violence (Rohlfs, 2010).1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates
that veterans comprise nearly 20 percent of the more than 30,000 suicides each year. Public
concern about the mental health problems of soldiers has prompted political action, with
President Barack Obama announcing a plan to increase the ease with which veterans diagnosed
with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can receive federal health benefits (Obama, 2010).
While a number of recent studies have found that PTSD is a growing problem for U.S.
soldiers deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Shen et al.,
2009a, b; Hoge et al., 2006, 2004; Erbes et al., 2007; Rosenheck and Fontana, 2007; Seal et al.,
2007; Tanielian and Jaycox, 2008), much of this work has been descriptive in nature. Those
studies that have used regression strategies (Shen et al., 2009ab, Rona et al., 2007) have been
hampered by data limitations that fail to adequately address the endogeneity of military service
or to disentangle the effects of deployment length from exposure to violent combat events.
1

Angrist et al. (2010) find greater disability take-up among Vietnam veterans with low earning potential. Autor et
al. (2011) also find evidence of a recent increase in disability uptake among Vietnam veterans but are unable to
distinguish whether this effect is driven by a long-term adverse health effect of combat or a recent liberalization in
benefit rules.

1

Using data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we
examine the relationship between military combat and young adults’ mental health while
carefully addressing the role of individual-level unobserved heterogeneity by controlling for
mental health prior to deployment as well as exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in
deployment assignment and exposure to violent combat events. We rely on evidence that
deployment assignments of active-duty units are unrelated to the characteristics of soldiers or
their families (Engel et al, 2010; Lyle, 2006) to identify the causal effects of combat.
We find that active-duty U.S. soldiers serving in combat zones are at greater risk of
PTSD and are more likely to receive psychological or emotional counseling than their activeduty counterparts serving outside the United States in non-combat zones. Our preferred
estimates suggest that combat-induced PTSD in the GWOT imposes two-year costs of $1.5 to
$2.7 billion on the U.S. health care system.
We find that the psychological costs of combat are largest for soldiers exposed to violent
combat events such as frequent enemy firefight. Soldiers who kill someone (or believe they have
killed someone), are injured in combat, or witness the death or wounding of a civilian or
coalition member are at substantially increased risk of suicidal ideation, depressive
symptomatology, and PTSD. Our findings suggest that military policymakers crafting optimal
deployment schedules that account for soldiers’ mental health should focus greater attention on
soldiers’ experiences with frequent enemy firefight as opposed to cumulative deployment length.

II. Background
A recent comprehensive review of the literature on military service, mental health, and
PTSD concluded that active duty officers, particularly those who have served and are serving in

2

combat in Iraq and Afghanistan during the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), suffer substantial
mental health problems (Tanielian and Jaycox, 2008). This review finds that 26 percent of active
duty soldiers returning from serving in the GWOT suffer from depression, drug and alcohol
dependency, homelessness, or suicide. Estimates of PTSD rates among those who served in Iraq
or Afghanistan ranged from 4 to 45 percent (Tanielian and Jaycox, 2008). However, most of the
studies on which these conclusions are based are descriptive in nature (see, for example, Hoge et
al, 2006, 2004), without a counterfactual control group to estimate the effect of military service
on psychological well-being.
Distinguishing the mental health effects of military service from associations due to hardto-measure characteristics of soldiers is a daunting task. This empirical difficulty also presents a
significant obstacle to the efforts of policymakers who wish to estimate the health care costs of
combat-induced mental health problems. For instance, Tanielian and Jaycox (2008) obtain a
two-year cost estimate for PTSD by assuming that the prevalence rate of PTSD for deployed
soldiers is equivalent to the effect of combat service. However, the authors do not construct a
counterfactual comparison group and therefore assume that in the absence of service, no combat
personnel would suffer from adverse mental health.
The most common comparison group constructed by researchers examining the health
effects of military service has been civilians (Jordan et al., 1991; Iowa Persian Gulf Study Group,
1997; McFall et al., 1992; Price et al., 2004; Card, 1987; McKiney et al., 1997; Kang and
Bullman, 2001).2 But, as Dobkin and Shabani (2009) note, the average individual and family
background characteristics of active duty servicemen are quite different from those of civilians,

2

A related literature on civilians has examined the mental health consequences of stressful domestic occupations
such as police work (Wang et al., 2010; Liberman et al., 2002) and firefighting (Bryant and Guthrie, 2005; 2007;
Heinrichs et al., 2005).

3

and many of these characteristics are also related to psychological well-being. If, for example,
socioeconomic status is negatively related to the probability of joining the armed forces (Segal et
al., 1998; Bachman et al., 2000; Kleykamp, 2006) and positively related to mental health (Miech
et al., 1999), then members of military may be prone to mental health problems even in the
absence of military service, leading to overstated estimates of the cost of combat service. On the
other hand, because military personnel go through a rigorous health screening prior to induction
or commissioning (see, for example, Department of Defense Directives 6130.3 and 6130.4),
individuals who serve in the military may not only be in better physical health than their civilian
counterparts, but they may also be in better mental health as well. Moreover, young people with
higher educational aspirations may both enlist in the military to earn educational benefits for
themselves or their families (Kleykamp, 2006) and be better equipped to cope with future mental
health problems.3 Each of these forms of selection would tend to understate the estimated effects
of combat service.
More convincing studies of the health effects of military service have focused on service
in the Second World War, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, and have addressed the
endogeneity of military service by using the draft lottery as an instrument (Angrist et al., 2010;
Hearst et al., 1986; Bedard and Deschenes, 2004; Dobkin and Shabani, 2009; Edwards and
MacLean, 2010). Using this approach, Angrist et al. (2010) and Dobkin and Shabani (2009) find
evidence that prior estimates of the health effects of military service were overstated due to
individual heterogeneity. However, the results still suggest that military service may adversely
affect health. Hearst et al. (1986) find that draft exposure was associated with an increased risk
of suicide and automobile accidents and Bedard and Deschenes (2004) find that veterans of

3

Moreover, recent descriptive work by National Priorities Project (2008) suggests that negative selection on
socioeconomic status may not be as severe today.

World War II and the Korean War were at substantial increased risk of mortality due to militaryinduced smoking.
The absence of a draft in the post-Vietnam era does not allow such an identification
approach to study the effect of randomly drawing a civilian for service in the GWOT. However,
researchers in the post-draft era have identified a potentially new source of exogeneous variation
in combat experiences among soldiers: the U.S. military’s deployment assignment procedures.
Two recent studies (Lyle, 2006 and Engel et al., 2010) have persuasively argued that deployment
assignment is exogenous to soldiers’ preferences, welfare, and family-level characteristics. For
example, Engel et al. (2010) note that the U.S. Army almost never deploys individual soldiers,
but rather deploys companies. An individual soldier has little control over the company to which
he or she is assigned and, as matter of policy, is reassigned every 3 or 4 years by Army Human
Resources Command. The timing and location of companies’ deployment assignments depend
on the circumstances of the military operation and the readiness and availability of the unit
(Engel et al., 2010). Thus, deployment assignments of soldiers are not based on individual
soldiers’ characteristics such as perceived bravery, mental toughness, or family circumstances,
but rather based on the operational needs of the Armed Forces:
“The ‘needs of the army’…captures the essence of all [military] assignments:
world events drive army assignments. [T]he timing of the move and assignment
of a soldier to a subordinate army unit are largely independent of a soldier’s
preferences… [O]nce a soldier is assigned to a division, the division assigns the
soldier to one of several brigades, the brigade assigns the soldier to one of several
battalions, and the battalion assigns the soldier to one of several companies. The
‘needs of the army’ also determine the missions that a soldier’s company
receives.” (Lyle, 2006, p. 323)

5

While Lyle (2006) and Engel et al. (2010) use unit deployment assignments to estimate
the causal effect of deployment-induced parental absences on children’s academic achievement,
no study of which we are aware has exploited variation in deployment assignments to identify
the mental health effects of combat experiences.
Three recent studies have examined the relationship between length of combat service
and mental health during the Global War on Terrorism using military records (Rona et al., 2007;
Shen et al., 2009ab). Their findings suggest that longer deployment lengths are associated with a
greater risk for a positive PTSD screening. While intriguing, these findings do not make clear
whether deployment length itself is the cause of mental health problems or whether it is the
effects of exposure to psycho-traumatic combat events that may be correlated with deployment
length. Disentangling the effects of deployment length from combat events is important for
military policymakers who wish to design deployment schedules that minimize mental health
problems of soldiers.
Our study contributes to the literature on the effects of military combat in the GWOT in
several important ways. First, our study is the first to use longitudinal data on military service
and mental health, which allows us to condition on mental health prior to deployment. 4 Second,
we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in deployment assignment and exposure to violent
combat events to better isolate the causal effect of GWOT combat experience on psychological
well-being. Finally, our study is the first to explore the mental health effects of specific violent
combat events, including engaging the enemy in firefight, killing or wounding someone, and
observing the death or wounding of civilians, coalition/allied soldiers, and enemy soldiers.

4

Our models also control for school fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity at the neighborhood level
and family fixed effects to control for fixed family-level heterogeneity.

III. Data and Measures
The data used in this study come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health), which was conducted by the Carolina Population Center at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Add Health is a nationally representative school-based
longitudinal study that began surveying U.S. adolescents in seventh to twelfth grades in the mid1990s. The Wave I in-home baseline survey was administered to 20,745 respondents during the
1994-1995 academic year. Three follow-ups have been conducted since the original Add Health
data collection effort. The first follow-up, the Wave II in-home survey, was conducted in 1996,
approximately one year after the baseline survey; the second follow-up (Wave III) was
administered in 2001, and the third follow-up (Wave IV), was administered in 2007-2008 to
15,701 of the original Add Health participants (see Harris et al., 2008 for more detailed
information on the Add Health data collection strategy).
The Add Health dataset is useful for our purposes because it (i) contains a relatively large
sample of military servicemen and women (N = 1,110) at the time of the Wave IV survey, and
(ii) provides information on whether active-duty servicemen and women were deployed to a
combat zone (N = 439), a non-combat zone outside of the United States (N = 153), or served on
active-duty in the United States exclusively (N = 343), and includes information on exposure to
specific combat events.5 Moreover, because the survey is longitudinal in nature and spans back
to adolescence, we have information on the respondent’s mental health prior to any military
deployment. We restrict our sample to respondents who provided non-missing information on
mental health and military service at Wave IV when the respondents were young adults ages 24
and 33.

5

The remaining 175 individuals are in non-active duty service exclusively in the Reserves or National Guard.

7

We measure military service in the United States Armed Forces using respondents’
reports of active duty service and deployment assignment at Wave IV.6 In our sample, 6.0
percent (N = 935) reported active duty military service and 1.1 percent reported non-active duty
service exclusively in the Reserves or National Guard (N = 175).7 Approximately 81 percent of
those who reported any military service served during the GWOT, while the remainder served
exclusively during the late 1990s when the U.S. was engaged in military operations in the
Balkans, including the Kosovo War (Operation Allied Force).
Importantly, the data allow us to distinguish between those who reported active duty
service exclusively in the United States, active duty service outside the United States in noncombat zones, and active duty service outside the United States in combat zones.8 Among those
who report active-duty service, 36.6 percent (N = 343) report service exclusively in the United
States, 16.4 percent report service overseas in a non-combat zone (N = 153), and 47.0 percent (N
= 439) report deployment in a combat zone. Among those who served in combat, 93.0 percent
reported combat service in the post-9/11 period.
We are also able to measure self-reports of violent combat events experienced by those
deployed to combat zones, including the number of “times [they] engaged the enemy in a

6

Service in the Armed Forces was measured using the following Wave IV questionnaire items:
Have you ever served in the military (Possible answers: Yes, No)
In which components of the military have you served? (Possible answers: Active
Duty, Reserves, National Guard, None)

7

The weighted means for military service in the 2008 Add Health are comparable to weighted means in the 2008
Current Population Survey and the 2008 American Community Survey. For instance, in the 2008 ACS, 5.0 percent
reported active duty service, as compared to 5.87 percent in Add Health. The unweighted means are slightly larger
in the Add Health due to an oversample of racial minorities, who are more likely to serve in the military.
8
The Wave IV Add Health questionnaire items used to obtain these measures were:
Was your military service in the US, outside the US, or both?
What is the total amount of time you (have) served in a combat zone?
The Add Health does not contain information on the country to which the soldier was deployed.

firefight,” whether they “ever kill[ed] or think [they] killed someone,” whether they were
“wounded or injured” during combat deployment, and whether they saw “anyone wounded,
killed, or dead, including ‘coalition or ally,’ ‘enemy,’ or ‘civilian.’” Among those who served in
a combat zone, the average number of enemy firefights was 15.2; 36.2 percent (N = 159) had
killed or believed they had killed someone, 11.9 percent (N = 52) were wounded or injured, and
64.7 percent (N = 284) witnessed the death or wounding of an ally, enemy, or civilian.
In the empirical analyses below, we examine the relationship between the above
measures of military service and four mental health outcomes measured at Wave IV. The first
measure, Suicide, is an indicator of suicidal ideation created using respondents report of whether
they had “ever seriously thought about committing suicide during the past 12 months.”
Respondents who answered in the affirmative were coded as 1 and those who answered in the
negative were coded as 0.
Second, we use an abridged version of the Center for Epidemiological StudiesDepression (CES-D) Scale, originally developed by Radloff (1977) and used widely as a
measure of depressive symptomatology. Respondents were instructed to indicate the frequency
with which they had experienced certain feelings or emotions during the past week, including
being “bothered by things that usually don’t bother you,” being unable to “shake off the blues,
even with help from your family and friends,” having “trouble keeping your mind on what you
were doing,” or feeling “depressed” or “sad.” Possible responses, which included “rarely or
none of the time” (= 0); “some or a little of the time” (= 1); “occasionally or a moderate amount
of the time” (= 2); and “most or all of the time” (= 3) were summed to produce a score of
between 0 and 15. From this score, we defined an individual as Depressed if he or she is ranked
in the top quintile of the distribution of CES-D scale, following a strategy employed by a number

9

of researchers (Tekin, Mocan, and Liang, 2009; Tekin and Markowitz, 2008; Chatterji and
Cuellar, 2006; Hallfors et al., 2004; Goodman and Capitman, 2000). An advantage of
dichotomizing the CES-D score in this manner is that it focuses attention on the right-hand tail of
the CES-D distribution, where medical diagnoses of major depression are made.9
Our third measure of mental health, Counseling, is generated using the respondent’s
answer to a question about whether he or she had “received psychological or emotional
counseling in the past 12 months.” Those who reported having ever received psychological or
emotional counseling were coded as 1 and those who had not as 0. This measure is valuable to
the extent that receipt of psychological counseling captures the presence of more severe
depressive symptomatology.
Finally, following much of the PTSD literature (Shen et al., 2009ab), we create an
indicator, PTSD, for whether the respondent had received a medical diagnosis of post-traumatic
stress disorder using responses to the question, “Has a doctor, nurse or other health care provider
ever told you that you have or had post-traumatic stress disorder?” Respondents who answered
in the affirmative were coded as 1 and those who answered in the negative as 0.
Our final two measures of mental health are useful because they involve doctor treatment
or diagnosis of mental health conditions, which may measure psychological problems that are
not adequately captured by a self-reported suicide measure or abridged CES-D scale. However,
using professional counseling and medical diagnosis measures raises a concern that we may
confound mental health conditions with access to health services or screenings. While we
control for health insurance status in all models, mental health screenings are increasingly
employed among active-duty personnel. For instance, service members are required to complete

9

Using the cutoff preferred by Sabia and Rees (2008) and Duncan and Rees (2005) as well as a self-reported
medical diagnostic measure produces qualitatively similar results.

10

a health assessment, which includes an evaluation of mental health, both before and after
deployment (Department of Defense Form 2795). While we do not have a direct measure of
access to screenings, for our primary analysis, our treatment and comparison groups are each
comprised of deployed active duty personnel or, in some cases, combat soldiers. To the extent
that active duty soldiers have comparable access to health care services and screenings, such
comparisons should mitigate concerns that we are picking up a unique “screening effect.” 10
The means and standard deviations of our dependent variables are presented in Panel A
of Table 1 by various measures of military service experience. A comparison of column (2) with
columns (3)-(8) generally shows that at Wave IV those who served in the military are in poorer
mental health than their civilian counterparts. Moreover, the magnitudes of the differences are
larger for those in more stressful missions, such as combat duty or enemy firefights.
In Panel B of Table 1, we show the means of mental health at Wave I prior to any future
military service.11 We find that those who serve in combat zones later in life have mental health
outcomes in adolescence that are no worse, and in some cases better, than their counterparts who
remain in civilian life. These findings are consistent with Department of Defense (DOD)
enlistment standards described in DOD Directive 6130.3 and DOD Instruction 6130.4, which
include screening for mental health problems such as depression and anxiety disorders.

IV. Baseline Results
OLS Estimates

10

As a robustness check, we also created a binary indicator for whether the individual has a check-up in the past 12
months or has utilized health care services. Adding these variables as an additional control did not alter any of the
results presented below.
11
Diagnosis of PTSD is not measured at Wave I; thus, this outcome is omitted from Table 1B.

11

We begin our empirical analyses by estimating an ordinary least squares (OLS) model of
the following form:
yi = α + δ1Activei + δ2Non-Active Dutyi+ Xi β + εi

(1)

where yi is one of the mental health outcomes for respondent i and Activei is an indicator for
whether the respondent reported active duty military service, Non-Active Dutyi is an indicator for
non-active duty service in the Reserves or National Guard, and the vector Xi includes a set of
individual and family background characteristics including age, race, ethnicity, gender, measured
height, measured weight, years of schooling attained, earnings, physical health, marital status,
religiosity, maternal educational attainment, parental marital status when the respondent was an
adolescent, parental income when the respondent was an adolescent, an abridged version of the
Peabody Picture and Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and health insurance status. The means of each
of these control variables, by military status, appears in Appendix Table 1.
OLS estimates of δ1 and δ2 from equation (1) are presented in Panel A of Table 2.12 The
omitted category is comprised of civilians who had never served in the military. The estimates
in Panel A show that those who report active duty service have a 2.0 percentage-point higher
probability of suicidal thoughts, a 3.1 percentage-point higher probability of depressive
symptomatology, a 4.8 percentage-point higher probability of psychological or emotional
counseling receipt, and a 7.8 percentage-point higher probability of PTSD than their civilian
counterparts. Those with non-active duty military experience are no more likely to have mental
health problems than those who have never served in military, with the exception that they are
more likely to have been diagnosed with PTSD.

12

We report standard error estimates that are robust to any form of heteroskedasticity (Angrist and Krueger, 1999),
and also cluster on the school. Estimation of the models via probit yielded qualitatively similar marginal effects.
The estimated coefficients on the variables in Xi are consistent with those found in the relevant literature and are
available from the authors.

12

In Panels B to D of Table 2, we present estimates by branch of service. We find the
largest and most consistently significant mental health effects of active duty service for the Army
(Panel B). For the Navy and Air Force, OLS estimates are much smaller in magnitude.
If, for the moment, we treat the OLS estimate as causal, δ1 can be interpreted as the
mental health effect of randomly drafting a civilian into active duty service. However, given that
active duty service is endogenous, δ1 is likely to be biased. An alternative contrast that may be
more informative is δ1 – δ2, the conditional mean difference in mental health between active duty
soldiers and reservists/national guardsmen. This comparison may assure more similarity on
unobservables by comparing populations that have each volunteered for some form of military
service. Comparing the coefficients on active-duty Army soldiers to national guardsmen and
reservists, we find that those on active duty have a 9.0 (11.6 - 2.6) percentage-point higher
likelihood of counseling and an 8.7 (13.9 - 8.7) percentage-point higher probability of PTSD.13

School and Family Fixed Effects
One critique of OLS estimates of δ1 (and δ2) is that they may capture unobserved
community-level characteristics associated with both psychological well-being and active duty
service. For instance, youths in economically depressed areas may have worse mental health and
face lower opportunity costs of volunteering for active duty service (Brown, 1985; Morrison and
Myers, 1998). Moreover, respondents from less socially connected schools may be more likely
to join the military and have worse psychological outcomes (Elder et al., 2010). Because of
these concerns, we take advantage of the fact that the Add Health data are school-based, and

13

In alternate specifications, we experimented with splitting the civilian population by those who worked in
protective services occupations, such as police and firefighting, with those who did not work in such professions.
The regression-adjusted difference in the mental health outcomes of active duty soldiers versus civilians employed
in protective services is qualitatively similar to that obtained when comparing active-duty personnel to all civilians.

13

augment equation (1) with school fixed effects (measured at Wave I when the respondent was in
junior high or high school) to control for school or community heterogeneity:
yis = α + δ1Activeis + δ2Non-Active Dutyis + Xis β +
where

s

s

+ εis,

(2)

is a vector of school fixed effects. Panel A of Table 3 presents estimates of δ1 and δ2

from equation (2). Our school fixed effects estimates are remarkably similar to OLS estimates
obtained without fixed effects in Panel A of Table 2, suggesting that while youths’
neighborhoods and schools may be related to the decision to later join the military, these effects
appear to be orthogonal to the relationship between military service and mental health.
Another critique of OLS estimates is that they may be confounded by family background
characteristics. For instance, there is evidence that individuals with fewer resources and larger
family sizes are more likely to join the military (Kilburn and Asch, 2003; Kilburn and Klerman,
1999), and as noted above, socioeconomic status has also been found to be related to mental
health (Miech et al., 1999). Moreover, the enlistment of a parent is associated with a greater
expectation and probability of service among offspring (Faris, 1984; Kilburn and Klerman, 1999;
Segal and Segal, 2004), suggesting that there may be common familial values associated with
military service and psychological well-being. To address the role of family-level
unobservables, we restrict the sample to full biological siblings (or twins) and add family fixed
effects to equation (1):
yij = α + δ1Activei + δ2Non-Active Dutyi + Xij β + ζj + εij,

(3)

where j denotes the respondent’s family, ζj is a vector of family fixed effects, and Xij is a vector
of individual characteristics that may vary between siblings, including physical health, height,
weight, gender, marital status, age, income, education, health insurance status, and PPVT score.

14

In Panels B and C of Table 3, we present estimates of equation (3) for full biological
siblings and twins, respectively. Identification comes from 115 discordant pairs of siblings and
42 discordant pairs of twins. Our findings show that controlling for fixed family level
unobservables does not diminish the estimated effect of military service on mental health despite
the reduced sample size and identifying variation. Across each of our mental health outcomes,
we find that active duty military service is positively related to depression, suicide, psychological
counseling, and PTSD. We find that respondents who serve on active duty have a greater risk
for PTSD than their siblings serving in the military in non-active duty roles.

V. Exploiting Variation in Deployment Assignment
Comparing active duty military personnel with their civilian schoolmates, siblings, and
non-active duty military counterparts is informative in the sense that we can rule out some
important forms of heterogeneity bias. However, these estimates are ultimately unsatisfying in
identifying causal effects because of unobserved individual heterogeneity that may be associated
with selection into active duty service. While the absence of a draft precludes its use a source of
exogenous variation in military service, we instead focus on active duty soldiers and explore
whether those who are assigned to combat duties experience worse mental health outcomes than
their active duty counterparts assigned to non-combat duties. This approach will identify the
effect of exogenous assignments to combat relative to non-combat duties assignments. We begin
by estimating:
yis = α + δ1Combatis + δ2Non-Active Dutyis+ δ3Active Non-Combat OUSis + δ4Active
Non-Combat USis + Xis β +

s

+ εis,

where Combat indicates active-duty service outside the U.S. in a combat zone, Active NonCombat OUSis indicates active-duty service outside the U.S. in a non-combat zone, and Active
Non-Combat USis indicates active-duty service exclusively in the United States.
The central focus of our attention in equation (4) is on the contrast δ1 – δ3. As noted
above, if deployment assignments are exogenous, then

^

^

can be interpreted as the causal

effect of combat service net of deployment (Lyle 2006; Engel et al., 2010). The descriptive
evidence in our data is consistent with this hypothesis. In column (1) of Appendix Table 2, we
restrict our sample to those for whom Combat OUSis = 1 or Active Non-Combat OUSis = 1, and
regress an indicator of whether the soldier served in combat on our set of observables. Of our 33
main right-hand side variables, which include a wide set of family and individual background
characteristics, 32 had associations that were statistically indistinguishable from zero, consistent
with the hypothesis that deployment assignment was exogenous to mental health.14
In Table 4, we present estimates of equation (4). We find that combat zone experience is
associated with an 8.6 (9.6 – 1.0) percentage-point higher probability of psychological
counseling and 14.2 (15.0 – 0.8) percentage-point higher probability of PTSD relative to active
duty service outside the United States in non-combat zones. Rates of suicidal thoughts and
depression, however, are statistically equivalent between these groups.
While our theoretical justification for the exogeneity of deployment assignments and
presentation of evidence on the similarities (on observables) between combat and non-combat
soldiers are informative, the richness of our data provides a further way to guard against the
possibility that deployment assignments are correlated with unmeasured traits of soldiers that are
related to mental health. Specifically, we take advantage of the longitudinal nature of the Add
14

Only the “other” race category was a significant predictor of combat; we control for this race category in all
models.

δ4Active Non-Combat USis + Xis β +

s

+ εis,

(5)

where t corresponds to Wave IV and t-3 corresponds to Wave I.15
The findings from equation (5) in Panel A of Table 5 show that active duty service in a
combat zone is associated with an 8.1 percentage-point increase in the probability of emotional
counseling and a 14.5 percentage-point increase in probability of PTSD relative to the change in
these outcomes by active duty counterparts serving in non-combat outside the United States.
These estimates are remarkably similar to those shown in the Panel A of Table 4, which do not
control for lagged mental health, providing further evidence in support of our hypothesis that
deployment assignment is exogenous to traits of soldiers that are fixed over time.16
An alternative way to remove time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity is through an
individual fixed effects model. In Panel B of Table 5, we show fixed effects models, estimated
via first differences, for the three mental health outcomes we observe in both Waves I and IV
(suicidal thoughts, depressive symptomatology, and emotional counseling), controlling for timevarying observables. These estimates, identified by those who volunteer for service between
Waves I and IV, are remarkably similar to those presented in earlier tables.
In a further effort to ensure that our comparisons of combat soldiers with non-combat
soldiers serving outside the United States captures similar types of soldiers, we restrict the
15

While 84.4 percent of respondents were younger than age 18 at Wave I, 30 respondents (0.2 percent) reported
military service at Wave I. To ensure that yist-3 captures pre-military mental health, we drop these 30 individuals
from our sample. However, the results are qualitatively similar with their inclusion. Because we do not have a
measure of PTSD at Wave I, our estimates from equation (5) include receipt of emotional or psychological
counseling as our pre-deployment dependent variable.
16
As another descriptive test of the plausible exogeneity of deployment assignment, Appendix Table 3 shows the
strong stability of the estimated contrast δ1 – δ3 to a wide set of controls for individual and family characteristics.

17

sample to those who had served in the military, and add controls for military rank, timing of
service in the military, branch of service, and occupation (four-digit Standard Occupational
Classification code) to the vector Xi . We also add a control for whether the respondent had a
medical checkup in the last year to control for propensity to use medical services, and continue
to control for pre-deployment mental health. These characteristics, along with those previously
included in Xi capture soldiers’ characteristics that are available to U.S. military personnel at
Human Resources Command when making deployment decisions (Engel et al., 2010).17 Panel A
of Table 6 presents our findings using these additional controls; the omitted category is
comprised of military personnel on non-active duty. The results in Panel A from our preferred
specification show that those serving in combat are 7.3 percentage-points more likely to obtain
psychological or emotional counseling and 12.1 percentage-points more likely to have been
diagnosed with PTSD than their active duty counterparts in non-combat zones outside the U.S.18
Finally, in Panels B and C of Table 6, we test the robustness of our estimates of δ1 – δ3 in
Panel A to more similar comparison groups. We restrict our sample to those who served in the
Army (Panel B) and to those who served in the Army in the post-9/11 period (Panel C). Our
findings in each of these panels continue to show that assignment to combat is associated with
substantial adverse mental health effects. Individual fixed effects estimates on the Army sample
(Panel D) and the Army post-9/11 sample (Panel E) show a similar pattern of results. 19

17

Military-specific occupations were measured with respect to the respondent’s job last year at Wave IV. The
categories include Military Officer Special and Tactical Operations Leaders/Managers, Infantry Officers, Special
Forces, Armored Assault Vehicle Officers, Artillery and Missile Officers, Air Crew Officers, Command and Control
Center Officers, and First-Line Enlisted Military Supervisors/Managers, and Radar and Sonar Technicians.
Occupations in engineering and medicine are measured in similar detail.
18
When we add pre-deployment CES-D and suicidal thoughts to the PTSD equation, the marginal effect remains
stable. Moreover, in unreported results, we find no difference in the mental health effects of combat by gender.
19
It may also be that the mental health effects of deployment differ by marital status. In results that are available
upon request, we descriptively explore this question. We find that the adverse effects of combat deployment are
slightly larger in magnitude for married as opposed to unmarried soldiers.

18

The Effect of Combat Events on Mental Health
The existing literature on the mental health effects of combat service in the GWOT have
focused on the effects of deployment length (Buckman et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2009a,b; Rona et
al., 2007). In Table 7, we replicate their findings using the Add Health. We restrict the sample
to those with combat zone experience20 and control for the augmented vector Xi, which includes
school fixed effects, military rank, branch of service, timing of service, occupation, and predeployment mental health. Consistent with Shen et al. (2009b) and Adler et al. (2005), our
results show that those serving more than 12 months in a combat zone experience an 12.9
percentage-point higher probability of receiving a PTSD diagnosis than those with combat zone
service of 1 to 6 months, and a 14.3 percentage-point higher probability of PTSD than those who
serve for one year or less.
However, an important question remains: Does deployment length adversely affect
soldiers’ mental health or is it psycho-traumatic violent combat events often associated with
longer deployments? To explore this question, we exploit a unique aspect of the Add Health data,
which include information on enemy firefighting and death-related experiences among those
who had deployed to a combat zone. Such experiences vary by combat deployment assignment,
which we argue above is exogenously assigned. In column (2) of Appendix Table 2, we find that
assignment to a frequent enemy fire combat zone is unrelated to observable family or individual
characteristics of soldiers.21 In Panel A of Table 8, we present estimates of the mental health
effects of experiencing enemy firefight. We find that those who experience enemy firefight have
a 10.4 percentage-point higher probability of suicidal ideation, an 11.2 percentage-point higher
probability of receiving psychological counseling, and an 18.3 percentage-point higher
20

This approach has the advantage of ensuring common health services/screenings among those assigned to combat.
Only being male is marginally positively related to the probability of enemy firefight. When we replicate Panel A
of Table 8 on a sample of males, our results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.

21

19

probability of PTSD. In Panel B, we examine whether those who engage more frequently in
enemy firefight suffer adverse psychological consequences. Our chosen specification divides the
frequency distribution of those who experienced enemy firefights in thirds. We find that those
who reported 20 or more engagements with enemy firefight had the largest adverse
psychological effects.
In Panel C of Table 8, we replicate the analysis in Panel A, but add controls for
deployment length. The results show that those who engage in more frequent enemy firefights
are at a greater risk for suicidal thoughts, depression, counseling, and PTSD than their
counterparts who face fewer combat firefights, although the coefficient on counseling is not
precisely estimated. Given that deployment assignments of combat units depend on military
need and readiness of the unit rather than characteristics of individual soldiers, the frequency of
enemy firefight can be thought of as exogenous to mental health and our estimates interpreted
causally. Interestingly, we find that the effect of deployment length is substantially diminished
after conditioning on number of enemy firefights and none of the deployment length effects are
statistically significant at conventional levels. This suggests that frequent enemy firefight drives
the adverse psychological consequences previously attributed to combat deployment length.22
In Table 9, we examine the effects of deaths and injuries on mental health, conditional on
deployment length. In Panel A, we find that those serving in combat zones who had killed (or
believed they had killed) someone experienced an 12.0 percentage-point increase in the
probability of suicidal thoughts, a 13.0 percentage-point increase in the probability of depressive
symptomatology, and a 22.2 percentage-point higher probability of PTSD than those who did not
believe they had killed another. In Panel B, we find that being wounded or injured in combat is
22

Cross-tabulations show that there is some independent variation between frequency of enemy firefighting and
mental health. For example, among those who deployed for more than 12 months 62.6 percent experienced fewer
than five firefights. Among those who deployed less than 12 months, 16.7 percent reported five or more firefights.

20

associated with a 18.4 percentage-point increase in the probability of depressive
symptomatology, a 27.5 percentage-point increase in the probability of psychological
counseling, and a 23.9 percentage-point higher probability of PTSD.
In Panel C, we explore whether observing someone wounded, killed, or dead affects
soldiers’ mental health. Because respondents were permitted to choose multiple categories
among “coalition or ally,” “enemy,” “civilian,” or “none”, in Panel C, we enter these nonmutually exclusive categories on the right hand-side of the estimating equation. The results
suggest that seeing a coalition/ally member or civilian killed, dead, or wounded has adverse
psychological consequences for those serving in combat zones. However, we find that observing
the killing, death, or wounding of the enemy has no independent adverse psychological
consequences. Despite limited power in these models, each of the coefficients for those who saw
wounded enemy are very close to zero in magnitude. This finding is consistent with the
hypothesis that strong feelings of guilt may accompany the death of non-combatants or friends.
Finally, in Table 10, we replicate the estimates in Table 9, conditional on number of
enemy firefights so as to compare those who have served in combat zones for similar lengths of
time and who have experienced a similar number of enemy firefights. The pattern of results in
Panel A suggests that the estimated mental health effect of killing someone in battle can largely
be explained by number of enemy firefights. However, even after conditioning on number of
firefights, we continue to find that being injured or wounded in combat and observing the death
or wounding of a civilian non-combatant are significantly positively associated with PTSD.
Finally, we find no independent effect of combat deployment length after controlling for
frequency of enemy firefight.

21

VI. Conclusion
The U.S. military has engaged in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last ten
years, deploying 2.16 million U.S. troops since October 2001 (Department of Defense,
2010a). As of March 10, 2010, 4,658 U.S. soldiers had been killed in action, 42,593 had
been wounded in action, and many more returning home with “invisible wounds,” such
as mental health injuries (Department of Defense, 2010b). In this study, we provide the
first set of credible estimates of the causal effect of combat service on young adults’
psychological well-being. We pay attention to the role of unmeasured heterogeneity by
controlling for mental health prior to deployment and exploiting plausibly exogenous
variation in deployment assignment and exposure to violent combat events.
The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that combat service is
associated with mental health problems and that the mechanism is driven by potentially
psycho-traumatic incidences experienced during combat zone missions. In particular, we
find that frequent enemy firefight, wounding or injury, and observing the death or
wounding of a coalition/ally or non-combatant is associated with a substantial increase in
the risk of suicidal thoughts and PTSD.
The U.S. Army recently announced plans to reduce combat zone deployments to
nine months and to increase the time between deployments to three years by the year
2014 (Tice, 2010). While our findings confirm that deployment length is associated with
declines in mental health, our results also show that this effect is driven by frequent
enemy firefight rather than deployment length alone. Thus, military policymakers
crafting optimal deployment schedules that account for mental health problems of
soldiers should focus greater attention on violent combat events rather than simply

22

soldiers’ time spent in a combat zone. Moreover, our findings suggest that reducing
soldiers’ exposure to civilian casualties in battle may also avert substantial adverse
mental health consequences for US soldiers.
To put the magnitudes of our estimates into perspective, we consider a crude
translation of the marginal effects measured in this paper into dollar terms, using
estimates of the costs of PTSD from the literature. Tanielian and Joycox (2008) estimate
the two-year, per-person, health care cost of PTSD to be between $5,904 and $10,298.
Our preferred marginal effect of combat-induced PTSD from Panel A of Table 6 is 0.121.
Then, an estimate of the two-year total costs of PTSD can be calculated by multiplying
our marginal effect by the 2.16 million U.S. troops deployed in combat zones in Iraq and
Afghanistan since 2001, and by the per-person cost estimate provided by Tanielian and
Jaycox (2008) to obtain a total health care cost estimate of $1.54 to $2.69 billion for
combat-induced PTSD. The largest share of these health care costs appears to be
generated by those in combat who experience greatest enemy firefight, are wounded, or
observe the death of non-combatants or coalition/ally soldiers.
It is important to keep in mind that our cost estimates are lower-bound estimates
of health care costs because they represent costs only for younger soldiers measured in
the short-run. Moreover, our costs do not capture the effects of combat-induced adverse
mental health on future labor market, marriage, and other socioeconomic outcomes23
Future research that follows soldiers as they transition back into civilian life will be able
to provide further information on the longer-run effects of combat service in the GWOT.

23

In the civilian context, depression and psychological impairment have been found to be associated with crime,
lower socioeconomic status, diminished educational attainment, and a grascheater propensity for marital problems
