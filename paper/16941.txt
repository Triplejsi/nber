Macroeconomic Conditions and Capital Raising
Isil Erel, Brandon Julio, Woojin Kim, and Michael S. Weisbach
NBER Working Paper No. 16941
April 2011
JEL No. E00,G21,G32
ABSTRACT
Do macroeconomic conditions affect firms’ abilities to raise capital? If so, how do they affect the
manner in which the capital is raised? We address these questions using a large sample of publicly-traded
debt issues, seasoned equity offers, bank loans and private placements of equity and debt. Our results
suggest that a borrower’s credit quality significantly affects its ability to raise capital during macroeconomic
downturns. For noninvestment-grade borrowers, capital raising tends to be procyclical while for investment-grade
borrowers, it is countercyclical. Moreover, proceeds raised by investment grade firms are more likely
to be held in cash in recessions than in expansions. Poor market conditions also affect the structure
of securities offered, shifting them towards shorter maturities and more security. Overall, our results
suggest that macroeconomic conditions influence the securities that firms issue to raise capital, the
way in which these securities are structured and indeed firms’ ability to raise capital at all. This influence
likely occurs primarily through the effect of macroeconomic conditions on the supply of capital.

1. Introduction
Practitioners view the possibility that macroeconomic conditions will adversely affect a firm’s
access to capital markets as an important factor in their firms’ financial policies. For example, Richard
Passov, the longtime treasurer of Pfizer, argues that the possibility of being shut out of the capital markets
during market downturns is the primary reason why Pfizer and other technology companies often place
such importance on a high bond rating (See Passov 2003). According to Graham and Harvey (2001)’s
well-known survey, an important goal of Chief Financial Officers is to maintain financial flexibility “so
that they do not need to shrink their business in case of an economic downturn (p.218).” While
practitioners view the potential shocks to the supply of capital as having the first order impact in shaping
financial decisions, academic corporate finance has focused more on the demand for capital as the key
determinant in security design (see for example Baker (2009)).
Do macroeconomic conditions in fact influence firms’ capital raising? If so, what is the channel
through which they operate? How do they affect firms’ choices of securities, the structure of those
securities, and firms’ very access to the capital markets? In this paper, we address these questions using a
sample containing detailed information on 21,657 publicly-traded debt issuances, 7,746 seasoned equity
offerings, 40,097 syndicated loans, and 12,048 private placements in the U.S. between 1971 and 2007. 1
Existing theories have a number of predictions about the relation between macroeconomic
conditions and the structure and availability of security issues. These theories can be broadly classified
into two groups, one based on firms’ changing demand for certain types and quantities of financing over
the business cycle, and the other based on supply-of-capital effects, driven either by a contraction in
available funds or through changes in investor demand for relatively safe securities. The demand-forcapital mechanism typically is based on changes in information asymmetries or adverse selection costs

1

Syndicated loans tranches are available for the latter part of our sample (from 1988 to 2007), and private placement
are available from 1981 to 2007. The primary sources of capital omitted from this sample are regular bank loans and
commercial paper.

over the business cycle. 2 If the adverse selection costs associated with asymmetric information between
firms and investors is negatively related to overall business conditions, poor macroeconomic conditions
will lead firms to issue less information-sensitive securities, shifting from equity to convertibles, and from
convertibles to debt. Traditional demand-based theories have found success in explaining cross-sectional
differences in corporate financing decisions, but have been less successful describing the time-series of
issuance decisions (Baker (2009)).
The second mechanism by which macroeconomic conditions can affect the distribution of
financing choices is through their effect on the supply of capital. Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) explain
how economic downturns can create a “credit crunch” that reduces the availability of intermediary capital,
especially for lower-rated firms. In addition, downturns can affect not only the availability of capital but
also the types of securities that investors demand. If volatility and economic uncertainty increase during
recessions, “flight to quality” models such as Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2008) and Vayanos (2004)
suggest that investors will become more risk averse, leading them to sell risky assets and to purchase
relatively safe assets instead. Flight to quality models predict that poor macroeconomic conditions lead
the supply of capital (i.e. demand for securities) to shift toward higher credit quality and lower volatility
because of a change in the relative prices of risky and safe assets.
These explanations are not mutually exclusive, so it is possible that macroeconomic conditions
could affect both the demand and supply of capital, or neither of them. Both demand and supply of
capital-based arguments conceivably could affect the quantity of capital raised by firms, the type of
securities they use to raise this capital, and the way in which these securities are structured.
Our econometric analysis suggests that macroeconomic conditions affect both firms’ abilities to
raise capital and the manner in which they raise it. We also find that cyclicality of different types of
securities depends on the credit quality of the issuing firms. For example, consistent with the prior
literature, the aggregate issuance of public equity over time is pro-cyclical. But this relation is driven

2

Examples of demand-based models of security choice are Choe, Masulis and Nanda (1993) and Bolton and Freixas
(2000).

primarily by noninvestment-grade borrowers, for whom public equity issuances, as well as
(noninvestment-grade) bond issuances are pro-cyclical. In contrast, for investment-grade borrowers,
public issuances of equity do not decline during downturns and issuances of both convertible and straight
public bonds are countercyclical. Similarly, during downturns, private loans significantly increase for
investment-grade borrowers but they significantly decline for noninvestment-grade borrowers.
These differences between investment-grade and noninvestment-grade firms in their capital
raising patterns over the business cycle are difficult to reconcile with demand-based theories of capital
raising. They are more consistent with the supply of capital shifting toward less risky securities during
worse economic times. Noninvestment grade firms raise capital when they can during strong economic
conditions and appear to be shut out of the public capital markets during poor economic conditions.
Higher quality firms take advantage of the increased demand for their higher rated securities and actually
increase their capital raising during macroeconomic downturns.
A prediction of the flight-to-quality hypothesis that does not also come from the information
arguments concerns the uses of the funds that are raised. The flight-to-quality theories predict that the
increased demand for safer securities in recessions will make issuing them relatively attractive, so that
high quality firms will issue debt and keep the proceeds as cash in recessions, while lower quality firms
will spend all capital they raise and not keep any as incremental cash. Consistent with the flight to quality
hypothesis, we find that investment grade firms tend to hold a larger proportion of capital raised in the
form of cash during recessions than in normal times, suggesting that the change in the relative prices of
high quality bonds induces a firm to issue, rather than raising the financing to invest in real assets.
In addition to the choice of securities, we also find that market-wide factors affect the structure of
debt contracts. In particular, market downturns decrease the expected maturity of public bonds and private
loans, and increase the likelihood that these loans are secured. These findings are consistent with both
views: poor macroeconomic conditions could lead firms to structure securities in ways that lessen their
information sensitivity or an increase in investor demand for relatively safe securities could lead firms to
issue securities with shorter maturities and more security.

3

Taken together, the empirical results tend to support the view that the supply of capital has a
larger impact than the demand for capital on corporate finance during economic downturns. First, public
bond issues, particularly those with high credit quality and short-term maturity, are countercyclical.
Second, the pro-cyclicality of bank loans and public bonds for lower-quality firms is contrary to the
demand-based information asymmetry hypothesis, in which firms prefer financing sources with a lower
sensitivity to information in response to a market downturn. Third, we find that the relative prices of
highly rated bonds to bonds of lower credit quality shifts during recessions. Specifically, the AAA to
BAA credit spread increases during recessions, consistent with an increase in investor demand for safer
securities (or the supply-of-capital arguments). Finally, investment grade firms hold a larger proportion
of the funds from the bond issue in the form of cash during recessions compared to expansions, consistent
with the hypothesis that firms respond to changes in the relative prices of securities.
This paper extends the literature on security choice in a number of ways. Important early
contributions to this literature are Jung, Kim and Stulz (1996) Lewis, Rogalski, and Seward (1999), and
Gomes and Phillips (2007) whose concern is how firm-level factors influence the choice of securities.
Gomes and Phillips (2007) in particular analyze a variety of securities including both public and private
issues of debt and equity and find support for the view that information asymmetries are an important
factor in firms’ choice of which security to issue.

We extend these papers by considering how

macroeconomic effects change these choices at the margin, because macroeconomic factors affect the
nature of information asymmetries and also the supply of capital. As such, our paper is in the tradition of
Choe, Masulis and Nanda (1993) and Korajczyk and Levy (2003), focusing on the details of how firms
raise capital and how the capital-raising process changes over the business cycle. To our knowledge, our
paper is the first to evaluate the different implications of demand versus supply based theories about
security issues over the business cycle, considering a menu of securities broader than between equity and
public debt, including convertibles, private debt, and private placements, as well as alternative
characteristics of public and private debt such as maturity and security.

2. Data Sources and Sample Description
A. Data Sources
We obtain data on security issues from three different sources: SDC Global New Issues Database
for public SEOs and private placements of both equity and debt, Mergent Fixed Income Securities
Database (FISD) for convertible bonds and other public debt, and Loan Pricing Corporation’s Dealscan
for private loans. The SDC database provides information on total proceeds and the number of primary
and secondary shares offered for each SEO. We drop SEOs that only offer secondary shares since these
offerings do not lead to a capital inflow to the firm. This process leads to a sample of 7,746 SEOs
occurring between 1971 and 2007. From SDC, we also obtain information on 12,048 private placements
of equity and debt between 1981 and 2007.
Mergent FISD provides comprehensive information for U.S. corporate debt, including total
proceeds raised as well as other characteristics such as maturity, security, convertibility, and credit quality.
We utilize all public debt issues made by industrial firms reported in FISD from 1971 to 2007. Our initial
public bond sample consists of 21,657 issues from 3,072 firms with Compustat identifiers. The average
initial maturity is 12 years and the median is 10 years. Most of the bonds are unsecured (96.3%) and
slightly more than half (55%) have investment-grade ratings.
Our data on bank debt are from Loan Pricing Corporation’s Dealscan, which contains detailed
issuance-level information on the characteristics of syndicated and sole-lender bank loans. These
characteristics include size and maturity of the loan, credit quality of the borrower, as well as information
on whether the loan is secured by some type of collateral or not. Each loan can have multiple tranches,
each of which contains different characteristics. Our sample comprises 40,097 completed loan tranches to
7,465 firms with Compustat identifiers between 1988 and 2007, including 364-day facilities (9.58%),
bridge loans (1.6%), term loans (29.84%), and revolving loans and credit lines (58.98%). 3 The mean loan

data with accounting data from Compustat. See Chava and Roberts (2008) for a discussion of the process of
gathering these identifiers.

maturity is about 3.7 years with a slightly shorter median of 3.4 years. Contrary to the sample of public
bonds, most of the loans are secured, with 79% of sample loans being secured by some type of collateral.
Using these issue-level data, we collapse each firm’s issues at the month level. We focus on
monthly issue-level data because our macroeconomic data is available monthly and we explore the
manner in which macroeconomic conditions affect firms’ capital raising decisions. 4 We then match the
firm-month observations with accounting information from most recent fiscal year end reported in
Compustat and eliminate all financial firms (one-digit SIC equal to 6) and utilities (two-digit SIC equal to
49). After this process, we end up with a sample containing 7,170 firm-months with SEO issues, 2,546
firm-months with convertible bond issues, and 10,400 firm months with straight public bond issues from
1971 to 2007, 2,957 firm-months with private placements of equity and 4,547 firm-months with private
placements of debt from 1981 to 2007, and also 20,322 firm-months with private loan contracts from
1988 to 2007.
For macroeconomic data, we obtain recession/expansion dates from the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) and GDP growth rates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
In addition to macroeconomic data, we consider a direct survey-based measure of the state of financial
conditions provided by the Federal Reserve, called the ‘Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank
Lending Practices.’ This survey is a quarterly survey of approximately sixty large domestic banks and
twenty-four U.S. branches of foreign banks, asking the managers of these banks how their bank is
changing their credit standards. The particular variable we focus on is the net percentage of domestic
respondents who claim that they are tightening standards for commercial and industrial loans. 5 One
limitation of this survey is that it is available only after the second quarter of 1990, so when we use the
survey data, we restrict our sample to this sub-period.
4

We have estimated all equations in the paper using firm-quarter issuance data matched with quarterly Compustat
data as well. Quarterly issuance data does not match perfectly with the macroeconomic data, but has the advantage
of corresponding exactly with quarterly accounting data. The results using quarterly data are in all cases similar to
those reported below and are available from the authors on request.

See Lown, Morgan, and Rohatgi (2000) for more information about the survey. These authors document that the
survey results are strongly related to loan growth, with tightening standards being associated with slower loan
growth.

B. The Pattern of Security Issues over Different Macroeconomic Conditions
Table I presents descriptive statistics of our security issuance sample. To provide a rough idea of
the time-series variation in the use of securities, we divide the sample into sub-periods based on the
NBER’s expansion/recession classification.

For each sub-period, we report the proceeds raised in

constant 2000 $US million for six types of securities in that period: SEOs, convertibles, straight public
bonds, private loans, and private placements of equity and debt. Since recessions are substantially shorter
than expansions during our sample period, we report the monthly average proceeds rather than total
proceeds during each sub-period.
A complicating factor in our analysis is that the quantity of capital raised increased substantially
over the sample period as the economy expanded even after controlling for the inflation, due in part to the
development of the syndicated loan market. Given the rapid growth in the quantity of issuances, it is
difficult to infer patterns about the incremental effect of macroeconomic conditions. Nonetheless, a few
patterns relating macroeconomic conditions and security offerings are evident from Table I. In particular,
during recessions, public equity offerings decline but public debt offerings increase. The rise of the
syndicated loan market is also apparent, coming into existence in the late 1980s and becoming the
predominant form of capital raising by the 2000s.
We observe a similar pattern in Figure 1, which reports the time-series trend of the natural
logarithm of the proceeds raised (in constant 2000 $US million) for each calendar month during our
sample period. Shaded areas in the figure denote recessions as defined by the NBER. Figure 1 highlights
the manner in which SEOs decrease during recessions while public bonds and convertibles increase.
Table II normalizes the value raised through each method of raising capital in each calendar
month by the total capital raised in that particular month, and documents the way in which the fraction of
capital raised by different methods varies over macroeconomic conditions. We measure macroeconomic
conditions using three alternative measures. In addition to an NBER-defined recession, we characterize
months by GDP growth, and label a month ‘Low Growth’ if GDP growth in that particular quarter is
below the 25th percentile of economic growth over the entire sample period. Finally we define ‘Weak

7

Credit Supply’ months as those for which the net percentage of senior loan officers indicating that they
are tightening standards for loans to large and medium firms is positive for that particular quarter.
Panel A of Table II presents the proceeds raised through alternative forms of financing for the
1971-1987 sub-period, for which there are no syndicated loans, while Panel B reports the results
subsequent to 1988, the first year for which we have data on syndicated loans. For both sub-periods, the
fraction of capital raised by public debt is larger during market downturns than in expansions. In contrast,
public equity issues are pro-cyclical, with larger fractions being raised during expansions than
contractions. Macroeconomic conditions have a somewhat ambiguous effect on convertibles; in the
earlier sub-period convertibles account for a larger fraction of capital raised during expansions while in
the latter sub-period they account for a larger fraction during recessions. Similar to public bonds, the
fraction of private placements of both equity and debt generally increases in worse macroeconomic
conditions. These results are generally consistent with the demand for capital argument that firms use
more information-sensitive securities during better economic conditions.
On the other hand, the demand-driven information-asymmetry hypothesis does not do well at
explaining patterns in private bank loans. Private debt appears to account for a higher fraction of capital
raised during expansions than recessions, in contrast to the information hypothesis, which suggests that
bank loans should be countercyclical. The observed pattern is better explained by the supply of capital
changing over the business cycle, so that in recessions overall intermediary capital declines sufficiently to
more than offset the substitution from public to private debt for monitoring reasons.
In addition to the broad type of securities offered, the quality and structure of the securities used
to raise capital also potentially vary depending on macroeconomic conditions. Table III breaks down the
public debt issues more finely, documenting the extent to which the use of bonds of different maturity,
security, and quality vary by market conditions. In the first two columns we report the relative proportion
of short-term public debt, as well as secured public debt. 6 We define a bond to be short-term if the time

6

Mergent does not contain any short-term debt issues prior to 1985. Hence, we consider short-term debt to be
missing before 1985 when computing the numbers presented in Table III.

8

to maturity of the issue is less than five years. 7 Our measure of security level is a dummy variable set to
one if the bond is secured and set to zero otherwise. If the firm issues more than one bond in a particular
month, we consider the observation to be secured if the proceeds raised from the secured bond is at least
half of the total proceeds raised.
The first column of Table III indicates that the relative proceeds raised through short-term debt
increase significantly during recessions and weak credit supply. However, the results for secured debt in
the second column of Table III are more ambiguous, with the proportion of debt that is secured being
somewhat higher in good economic times than in downturns. The remaining columns of Table III present
the fraction of capital raised by public debt with different credit quality across varying macroeconomic
conditions. The pattern here is clear: Lower quality and unrated debt issues decline substantially during
poor market conditions. During recessions, the quantity of low-quality issues declines to one third to one
half of the expansion levels, depending on the sample period used. In contrast, the level of investable Brated issues is about the same, leading the fraction of A-rated issues to increase by about twenty
percentage points during recessions. The pattern is similar if we measure market conditions using GDP
growth or the survey of credit supply, although the differences are somewhat smaller.
Figure 2 illustrates this pattern graphically. The vertical axis measures the natural logarithm of
proceeds raised (in constant 2000 $US million) through public bonds of various quality. The figure
suggests an overall upward trend in the use of public debt financing in all levels of credit quality.
However, it also points out the differential impact of a recession on the public debt with different ratings.
During recessions, the quantity of capital raised by low-rated and non-rated debt issues drops significantly
while highly-rated bonds remain relatively constant or even rise.
3. Firm Characteristics
In addition to market-level characteristics, firm-level characteristics affect both the likelihood of
raising capital, and conditional on raising capital, the method used to raise the capital. To illustrate how

7

If the firm issued more than one bond in a given month, then the issue activity is classified as short-term if the
proceeds-weighted maturity of the bonds is less than five years.

9

firm-level differences vary with the frequency capital raising, the first two columns of Table IV compare
characteristics of firms in months in which some type of security was offered to months in which no
security was issued.

These characteristics are firm size (natural logarithm of total assets), market

leverage, market to book, cash flow, cash, the inverse of interest coverage, a debt-rating dummy, sales
growth, and the past stock return. Inverse interest coverage is defined as the natural logarithm of
(1+interest/EBIT) and stock return is calculated over the previous twelve months. 8

The accounting

variables reported are taken from the fiscal year-end immediately prior to the issue.
Relative to firm-months with no issues, firms in issuing months tend to be larger, older, and have
higher growth and better prior stock performance. For the issuing months, the average sales growth for
the year just prior to the security issuance is 0.27 during the whole sample period, compared to 0.18 for
non-issuing months. The stock return over the previous twelve months is 0.36 for issuing months
compared to 0.17 for non-issuing months. In addition, issues are less likely during market downturns in
most cases, regardless of which measure of financial conditions one uses.
The remaining columns of Table IV summarize differences in firm characteristics across issuers
of alternative securities. Equity issuers tend to be the smallest, youngest, and have the highest market to
book ratios. Public debt issuers are substantially larger, and have higher fixed asset ratios than issuers of
other types of securities. In contrast, issuers of private loans and private placements of debt are noticeably
smaller than public debt issuers, with lower cash flows and fixed assets. This pattern suggests that public
debt issuers are noticeably different from other kinds of issuers, consistent with the view that publiclytraded debt is the most attractive form of financing, and that firms using other forms are unable to issue
publicly-traded debt.

4. Multivariate Analysis of Security Choice
The aggregate statistics and the univariate comparisons are both suggestive of the hypothesis that
firm characteristics and macroeconomic conditions affect the way firms raise capital. However, to

Appendix Table 1 contains detailed definitions of all variables.

10

identify the effect of macroeconomic conditions on the issuance of the firms’ funding choices, it is
important to estimate this relation in a multivariate setting, controlling for firm-level factors and time
trends. Consequently, we employ discrete-choice models that estimate the likelihood of a firm issuing a
specified type of security in a particular time period. At any point in time, a firm can choose not to obtain
financing, to obtain a private loan, to issue private placements of either equity or debt, or to access the
public security markets by issuing a straight bond, convertible bond, or seasoned equity. Given the
number of potential alternative outcomes, we utilize econometric approaches that allow for multiple
discrete choices.
A. A Multinomial Logit Approach
Multinomial logit models provide one way to estimate systems in which independent variables
affect the choice among a finite number of alternative outcomes. Thus, it provides a natural way of
modeling a firm’s choice of how to raise capital given alternative financing methods, or not to raise
capital at all. 9 Specifically, we estimate the following model:

Pr(security type = j ) =

e
6

β j 'X

∑e

(1)
βk 'X

k =0

where j equals 0 if the firm does not issue any type of security, 1 for a bank loan, 2 for a public bond, 3
for a convertible debt, 4 for an SEO, 5 for a private placement of equity, and 6 for a private placement of
debt. βj is a vector of coefficients for outcome j where β0 is assumed to be zero, and X is a vector of
explanatory variables.
Panel A of Table V reports estimates of this equation. In each specification, ‘no issue’ is the
omitted variable, so the coefficients in each column can be interpreted as the impact on the probability of
issuing a particular type of security relative to not issuing at all. Specification (1) uses the NBER-defined

9

One potential drawback to multinomial logit is the underlying independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption,
which requires that the choice between any two financing choices be independent of the existence of a third choice.
For example, the multinomial logit specification implicitly assumes that the choice between public debt and private
debt is independent of the choice of whether or not to issue seasoned equity. See Greene (2000) pp. 857-862, and
875-879 for more discussion on the estimation and properties of multinomial logit.

11

recession as our measure of market conditions, while (2) uses the level of GDP growth. We also report
results of a model using the Senior Loan Officer Opinion survey on lending standards in Appendix Table
2. Each specification also includes a number of variables designed to capture the firm’s financial
condition and demand for capital (e.g., market to book, cash flow, and sales growth). Other firm-level
controls are firm’s age, natural logarithm of the total assets, market leverage, cash, natural logarithm of
the inverse of interest coverage, 10 and a debt-rating dummy. We also include the firm’s stock return for
the prior twelve months, which restricts our sample to listed firms. Furthermore, we include the term
spread, defined as the difference between the yields on ten-year treasuries and one-year treasuries, as a
macro-level control. Finally, all equations include industry fixed effects. 11 The equations are estimated
using a panel of monthly observations for all firms that had at least one type of security issue at any point
during the sample period, a procedure that leads to 728,639 observations. 12 We calculate the standard
errors in these equations allowing for clustering of observations at the firm level.
In Panel A of Table V (and also in Panel A of Appendix Table 2), the coefficient on the variable
indicating poor macroeconomic conditions is negative and statistically significantly different from zero
for SEOs, using all measures of the downturns. Additionally, the SEO coefficient is statistically
significantly different from the coefficients on the other securities in the specifications using the recession
dummy and the weak credit market dummy variable as our measures of financial conditions. This result
indicates that a recession lowers the likelihood of issuing an SEO, relative to not issuing any security or
issuing any other type of security and is consistent with the notion that as financial conditions worsen,
firms are less likely to issue public equity. As such, it confirms the findings of Hickman (1953), Moore

10

The transformation used is a negative function of conventional interest coverage, so that the negative coefficient
on this variable for a specific security type means that better interest coverage increases the likelihood of the
corresponding issue type. We use this transformation because the usual measure of interest coverage becomes
infinite for all-equity firms.
11
One exception is in Panel C below, for which the multinomial logit model does not converge when we include
industry fixed effects. We also ran the regressions reported in Panel B for noninvestment-grade borrowers without
industry fixed effects and found similar results.
12
We obtain similar results when we include all other firms in Compustat that did not have any security issue during
the sample period.

12

(1980) and Choe, Masulis and Nanda (1993), who find similar patterns of security issuances over earlier
time periods (1900-1938, 1946-1970, and 1971-1991 respectively).
Convertible bonds appear to be more likely to occur during poor economic times, holding other
factors constant. All three coefficients on the variables indicating poor financial conditions are positive
(see Panels A of Table V and Appendix Table 2), and two of them are statistically significantly different
from zero. These results provide evidence for the argument that firms that otherwise would be issuing
public equity choose to issue a convertible bond during market downturns. Given that asymmetric
information likely increases during these downturns, this pattern is consistent with the logic of the Stein
(1992) model, in which convertible bonds are issued as an alternative to equity when asymmetric
information is high.
The other coefficients in the equations in Panel A of Table V are consistent with the view,
implicit in the Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) model among others, that the firms issuing public debt are
the lowest quality risks to a lender. These coefficients indicate that, relative to firms that issue other types
of securities (or no issue at all), public debt issuers are oldest and are most likely to have a debt rating. In
addition debt issuers in general are larger than firms that issue equity either publicly or privately.
Because the supply of capital arguments imply that recessions should affect poorly-rated firms’
access to capital more than highly rated ones, we reestimate these equations on subsamples of
noninvestment-grade and investment-grade borrowers in Panels B and C of Table V, as well as Appendix
Table 2, Panels B and C. We define investment-grade firms as those that ever issued at least one
investment-grade public bonds during the whole sample period.
The results from these panels imply that a firm’s quality leads to very different capital-raising
patterns over the business cycle. The coefficient on the issuance of public equity remains negative and
significant for noninvestment-grade borrowers in all specifications. However, for investment grade
borrowers, it is consistently positive although not statistically significant. In addition, issuances of
convertible bonds do not appear to be countercyclical for non-investment grade firms while they are
strongly countercyclical for investment grade firms.

In the estimates using the entire sample in Panel A of Table V, we do not observe an increase in
the quantity of public bonds and bank loans during economic downturns, which is difficult to reconcile
with issuers shifting towards less information sensitive financing sources as predicted by the demandbased theory. However, when we break down our estimates into noninvestment-grade and investmentgrade firms in Panels B and C of Table V and Appendix Table 2, it becomes clear that combining firms of
all quality masks important differences in the borrowing behavior between noninvestment-grade and
investment-grade firms over the business cycle. In particular, these estimates imply that private loans
significantly increase for investment-grade borrowers but they significantly decline for noninvestmentgrade borrowers, consistent with the view that capital available to intermediaries goes down and
consequently they tighten lending standards during down cycles. We see a similar pattern for public
bonds: the coefficient on issues of public bonds is negative and statistically significant for noninvestmentgrade borrowers while it is positive and statistically significant for investment-grade borrowers.
Both the credit crunch and flight to quality (supply-based arguments) predict that we should
observe better quality firms issuing debt during recessions than during expansions. The credit crunch
arguments suggest that capital is rationed from the poorly-rated firms and that only the highly-rated ones
can receive financing. In addition, the flight to quality arguments compound this effect because they
imply that financiers will prefer lending to highly-rated firms during recessions. This argument is
commonly made by practitioners, who often claim that one reason for having a high bond rating is to
avoid getting shut out of the debt market during poor economic times (see Passov (2003) and Graham and
Harvey (2001)). Thus, a clear prediction of the supply of capital arguments is that a higher fraction of
issuances of debt should be of high quality during recessions than during expansions.
Our findings provide strong support for these commonly discussed arguments of practitioners, as
well as the credit crunch and flight-to-quality arguments. During bad economic times, poor quality
borrowers appear to be shut out of the bond market. The only bonds that are not affected by poor
economic times are highly-rated ones. In other words, the fact that the quality of bonds issued is strongly
countercyclical is evidence consistent with the view that financial constraints are exacerbated during

14

recessions. This finding mirrors the patterns reported in Kahle and Stulz (2010), who report that large
investment-grade firms’ capital raising was not substantially affected by the Financial Crisis of 2008.
Could changing demand for capital be responsible for these effects? In other words, could it be
possible that poorly rated firms simply demand less capital during recessions than during expansions?
This pattern of demand seems unlikely, since poorly rated firms typically are relatively highly cyclical
and will require more outside funding during poor economic times. The fact that poorly rated firms often
require a Chapter 11 reorganization to obtain DIP financing during recessions is strongly suggestive of
the notion that they have trouble raising outside capital at these times. Consistent with the prior literature
(for example, Hertzel and Smith (1993)) arguing that firms under information asymmetry choose private
placements, lower-quality firms in our sample seem to be relying more on private placements, especially
of equity, during downturns (see Panels B of Table V and Appendix Table 2 for the positive and
significant coefficient for noninvestment-grade borrowers).
Consistent with this logic is the strong negative relation between cash holdings and the
probability of issuing investment grade debt. As argued by Almeida, Campello and Weisbach (2004,
2009), more financially constrained firms are likely to save a higher percentage of cash from their cash
flows. Firms with low bond ratings are more likely to face financial constraints, so they will tend to save
more cash, leading to a negative relation between firms’ cash holdings and the ratings of the bonds they
issue. During recessions, poorly rated firms use up their cash reserves since they cannot raise capital.
Consequently, the relation between business conditions and the quality of issuances is likely driven by
supply of capital rather than demand for capital considerations. 13 In the next section, we analyze the uses
of funds for borrowers with different credit ratings in detail.
B. Uses of Funds from Capital Raising Activities over the Business Cycle

One objection to this “constraints” view is that there must be some interest rate at which poorly rated firms can
issue public debt during recessions. But that rate must be sufficiently high so that the firms choose to draw down
their cash and lines of credit rather than paying it. If this were the case, it is nonetheless the limited supply of capital
that ends up leading to poorly-rated firms not issuing public debt during recessions.

The flight-to-quality hypothesis shares many of the same predictions as the demand for capitaldriven information hypothesis. In particular, both suggest that the distribution of external financing
choices shift towards securities of less information sensitivity or lower risk during a downturn. The
flight-to-quality hypothesis, however, contains the additional prediction that investors’ demand for safer
securities changes the relative prices between securities of different risk. If, as predicted by the flight-toquality models, investor demand shifts toward safer securities in response to a poor macroeconomic
environment, there should be a shift in the relative prices of securities of different quality. Confirming
this hypothesis, Figure 3 reports the time-series trend in AAA and BAA corporate bonds as well as the
difference between the two. The figure clearly indicates that credit spread increases in recessions making
higher quality debt more attractive to issue. As Baker (2009) argues, firms have an incentive to issue
these safer securities when their relative prices have dropped. Consequently, we expect the distribution of
securities issuance choices to shift towards relatively safer assets, such as from equities to bonds, similar
to the prediction of the asymmetric information hypothesis.
One key difference between these hypotheses is that in the demand for capital-driven information
story, firms issue securities when they have a need for external financing, such as for investing in fixed
capital. In contrast, if firms are issuing securities in response to changes in relative prices due to a flight
to quality episode, firms are more likely to hold the funds as cash, rather than to invest the proceeds
immediately. Thus, one way to distinguish whether macroeconomic conditions are changing issuance
choices directly through information asymmetries or indirectly through affecting investor demand for
securities is to investigate differences in the uses of proceeds from the capital raising activities across the
business cycle.
To examine the effect of macroeconomic conditions on the ex-post uses of funds from new
capital raised, we first aggregate all proceeds raised from different security types within a calendar
quarter. We then match the most recent fiscal quarter before the issuing quarter and the most adjacent

16

fiscal quarter after the issuing quarter. 14 We then estimate equations similar to those reported in Kim and
Weisbach (2008), using the following specification:
⎡⎛ capital raised ⎞ ⎤
⎡⎛ capital raised ⎞ ⎤
⎟⎟ + 1⎥ + β 2 ln ⎢⎜⎜
⎟⎟ + 1⎥ × RecessionDummy + β3 ln[total assets0 ] + ε (2)
Y = β 0 + β1 ln ⎢⎜⎜
⎣⎝ total assets0 ⎠ ⎦
⎣⎝ total assets0 ⎠ ⎦

where Y = ln[((Vt − V0 ) total assets 0 ) + 1] , V is quarterly cash and short term investments, and t is the
number of fiscal quarters subsequent to the issuing quarter . We estimate the uses of capital from proceeds
raised depending on both firm quality and macroeconomic conditions.

We classify a firm as

noninvestment-grade if it never issued an investment-grade public bond during the whole sample period
based on Moody’s ratings. We define a calendar quarter as being in a recession if that quarter includes a
recession month based on NBER classification. We estimate equation (2) for intervals of one quarter, four
quarters and eight quarters following the issuing quarter.
We present estimates of equation (2) for noninvestment grade and investment grade issuers
separately in Table VI.

The first four columns report the coefficient estimates and t-statistics for

noninvestment grade firms and the remaining columns present the corresponding numbers for investment
grade firms. The results reported in the first three row aggregates all sources of external capital raised in
a given calendar quarter. The remaining lines report the results separately for each different sources of
financing.
The coefficient β1 measures the proportion of proceeds raised in an issue used to increase cash
(including short-term investments) during expansions while β2 captures the incremental impact of a
recession on the fraction held in cash. 15 A direct implication of the flight-to-quality arguments comes
from the effect of proceeds raised on increases in cash and short-term investments. In expansions, lower
quality firms save a substantially higher portion of the capital raised than high quality firms, consistent
with the usual precautionary savings motive (see Almeida et al. 2004). That is, β1 for noninvestment-

14

For March, June, September, December firms, the most adjacent fiscal quarter would be the same as the issuing
calendar quarter.
15
Cash excluding short-term investments is often missing in quarterly Compustat, which is the main reason why we
resort to cash including short-term investments.

17

grade firms are higher than those for investment-grade firms in most cases. However, in recessions, low
quality firms save much less of the capital they raise for all sources of financing taken together, as well as
for vast majority of different financing sources, regardless of the intervals. In contrast, during down
cyles, investment-grade firms save substantially more from all financing sources as a whole and
especially from SEOs and public bonds than they do in expansions. This pattern is consistent with the
flight-to-quality arguments: In recessions the cost of raising capital for low-quality firms is relatively
high, so they raise capital only when it is absolutely necessary to fund investments. In contrast, the price
of capital is abnormally low for high quality issuers during recessions, so they will actually increase their
issuances beyond what is necessary to fund investments and save the proceeds as cash.

5. Market Conditions and the Design of Debt Contracts
An additional testable implication provided by both demand-based and supply-based hypotheses
is that, conditional on the type of security used, firms will alter the structure of those securities depending
on macroeconomic conditions. Regardless of the type of security used, we expect to observe that as
market-wide conditions weaken, firms will adjust the design of their securities either to minimize their
sensitivity to information or in response to relative price changes as investors’ demand for safer assets
increases. 16
A. Publicly-traded Bonds
We first examine how the characteristics of public bonds vary over the business cycle. Both the
information-sensitivity and risk profile of a bond increases in the bond’s maturity and decreases when a
bond is secured with real assets, holding all other factors constant. Therefore, we expect to observe that,
all other things equal, firms are more likely to use shorter maturity bonds or secured bonds when market
conditions are relatively poor.

16

A related implication of this argument is that lenders should impose tighter covenants on borrowers during
recessions. Zhang (2008) examines this hypothesis on a sample of large US firms and finds that covenants are
stricter when set during downturns and they lead to higher recovery rates later. Similarly, Santos and Winton (2008)
find that loan spreads rise in recession more so for those without public debt market access.

18

We estimate equations predicting whether the bond is short term and whether the bond is secured,
conditional on an issuance of public debt. We restrict the sample to those firm-months for which there is
a bond issue, so there are two possible outcomes, either short-term or long-term, and either secured or
non-secured and estimate the following logit models. 17

Pr(bond maturity = short term) =

Pr(bond security = secured ) =

18

e β ′X
1 + e β ′X

e β ′X
1 + e β ′X

(3)

(4)

where β is a vector of coefficients for short-term debt in equation (4) and secured debt in equation (5), and
X is a vector of firm characteristics and financial conditions.
Panel A of Table VII contains estimates of these equations. The first three columns of this table
report the estimates for equation (3). The results suggest that financial conditions and the maturity of
publicly-traded bonds are negatively related.

The coefficients on the variables representing poor

conditions are all positive and statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the notion that weak
macroeconomic conditions exacerbate asymmetric information problems, since shorter maturity
securities’ value fluctuates less with changes in information about firm value than does longer maturity
securities’ value. However, to the extent that short-term bonds are less risky-than long-term bonds the
results can also be explained by a flight to quality within this asset class.
Additionally, consistent with the Diamond (1991) liquidity-risk arguments, we find that shortterm debt issuers tend to be larger, have stronger growth opportunities, and less cash on the balance sheet
than firms that can issue long-term debt. The large effect of growth opportunities, as measured by the

17

There are some months for which a firm issues more than one bond. In these cases, we define short-term firmmonths as those with proceeds-weighted initial maturity of less than or equal to five years. Similarly, secured firmmonths are defined as those with proceeds-weighted secured dummy greater than or equal to 0.5.
18
We have estimated a number of alternative specifications that we have reported in previous drafts. In particular,
we have estimated two-stage models in which we first estimate the likelihood of a bond issue, and then estimate,
conditional on the issue, the factors that affect the structure of the issue. We have also estimated multinomial logit
models in which firms face a choice of not to issue, to issue short-term, or to issue long-term (and similarly with
security). As the results from each specification are similar, we choose to report results from the simpler
specification.

19

market-to-book ratio, is also consistent with Myers (1977) and Barnea, Haugen and Senbet (1980), in
which firms with better growth opportunities issue on shorter term maturities to help minimize potential
agency conflicts. The results are also largely consistent with the Flannery (1986) signalling model in that
short-term debt issuers seem to be of higher quality being older, larger and having more growth options
compared to long-term debt issuers.
Columns (4), (5), and (6) report estimates of equation (4), which contains the factors that affect
the likelihood that a particular bond is secured. These estimates for bond security are more difficult to
interpret than those for maturity. For the low-growth dummy, the coefficient is positive and significantly
different from zero.

However, the coefficients on the other financial condition variables are

insignificantly different from zero with opposite signs from one another.
In addition, the results from Panel A of Table VII document the firm-level factors that affect the
decision to use secured debt. These results suggest that firms issuing secured debt tend to be smaller and
much more highly levered than unsecured issuers. Firms also tend to issue secured debt when they have
high fixed asset ratios and after periods of poor stock returns. They tend to hold more cash, which
indicates that firms issuing secured debt are concerned about liquidity constraints in the future. These
findings are consistent with the ‘banking’ view of secured debt (Berger and Udell (1990)), which focuses
more on the effect of (limited) supply of capital and catering to investors’ demands on financial choices.
Here, poor quality firms have little choice but to issue secured debt as investors are more likely to require
direct collateral when the firm is nearing bankruptcy. On the other hand, they do not support the
traditional demand-driven ‘corporate finance’ view, in which high quality firms issue secured debt to
avoid underinvestment problems associated with the priority of existing debt claims (Stulz and Johnson
(1985), Smith and Warner (1979), and Berkovitch and Kim (1990)).
B. Private Loans
We next examine the way in which macroeconomic conditions and firm-specific factors affect the
structure of private loans. As with our analysis of public debt offerings, we classify private loans by
maturity and security level. As before, we consider a loan or collection of loans to be short-term if the

20

weighted maturity is less than five years, and classify the loans as secured if the proceeds-weighted
secured dummy is larger than or equal to 0.5. We then estimate equations predicting the factors that affect
whether a loan is short or long-term, and whether or not it is secured. Similar to the equations (3) and (4)
estimated for bonds, we restrict our sample to those firm-months for which a loan was issued, and
estimate the equations using a logit model.
Panel B of Table VII presents estimates of these equations. The first three columns report
estimates of the factors that affect the choice between short-term and long-term loans. Similar to public
bonds, the conditional probability of obtaining a short-term loan increases during economic downturns
and tightening credit markets, consistent with the hypothesis that firms turn away from more informationsensitive or risky loans during downturns. In addition, firms that get short-term private loans tend to be
smaller, have lower debt levels, and are less likely to have obtained a credit rating than firms that obtain
long-term loans. These findings are in contrast to those for short-term bond issuers, who tend to be larger
firms that have credit ratings.
The last three columns of Panel B of Table VII report estimates of equations predicting whether a
given loan will be secured or unsecured. The coefficients on the three indicators of financial market
conditions are positive and statistically significant. These results suggest that weak credit conditions are
associated with a higher use of secured relative to unsecured loans.
The effect of macroeconomic conditions on security appears to be different for loans, where
market downturns clearly increase the likelihood of security, than for bonds, where this effect is
significant only for one of three measures of financial conditions. One possible explanation is that
secured public debt is relatively rare, with only 5 percent of issues being secured. In contrast, 79% of
private loans in our sample are secured. Thus, it is not surprising that the results for security are more
clear cut for the sample of loans, where security is a common feature, than for bonds, where it is not.
In addition, the same firm-level factors that lead firms to issue secured public debt lead firms to
use secured private loans. In particular, firms obtaining secured loans tend to be younger, smaller, highly
levered with low interest coverage and weak cash flows. Similar to the results from the public debt, this

21

pattern strongly supports the supply of capital–driven ‘banking view’ of secured debt, in which firms tend
to use secured debt in situations in which lenders are unwilling to lend absent security. It is counter to the
demand for capital-driven ‘corporate finance’ view, in which firms use secured debt as a way of finessing
future agency problems.

6. Discussion
Macroeconomic conditions are widely believed to affect the way in which firms raise capital, and
indeed their very ability to do so. There are a number of theories that predict a relation between the way
in which firms raise capital and macroeconomic conditions. These theories can broadly be categorized
into demand for capital-based theories, which are usually based on information asymmetries, and supply
of capital based theories, which argue that recessions decrease the supply of capital, especially to poorly
rated firms, through a combination of a credit crunch and a flight to capital. Both demand and supplybased theories have predictions for the types of securities that are offered at different points in the
business cycle, the way that securities are structured at different points in the business cycle, and the types
of firms that issue securities at different points in the business cycle.
We evaluate the way in which macroeconomic conditions affect capital raising using a sample of
capital-raising activities by US corporations, including 7,746 seasoned equity offerings, 21,657 public
debt offerings, 12,048 private placements of equity and debt, and 40,097 private loans. Using these data,
we obtain a set of stylized facts about the types of securities issued at different points in the business
cycle, the way these securities are structured at different times, and the financial soundness of the firms
that issue at those times.
When interpreting these findings, there are two main questions to be asked. First, do
macroeconomic conditions affect capital raising at all? Second, which theories best explain which of the
particular patterns of a particular type of capital raising?
The answer to the first question is clear: Macroeconomic conditions are an important determinant
of capital raising. They impact the types of securities used by firms, the way these securities are

22

structured, and perhaps most importantly, the types of firms that are able to receive financing at different
points in time.
The effect of macroeconomic conditions on capital raising differs substantially depending on the
financial soundness of the firm in question. For lower-rated, noninvestment-grade firms, the likelihood
that it raises capital decreases when overall market conditions worsen, regardless of whether we measure
this worsening by an NBER-defined recession, the growth rate of GDP, or credit tightness due to a
Federal Reserve Survey of bankers. For these firms, the likelihood they receive a loan, issue a bond, or
issue public equity all decline with poor macroeconomic conditions. The only manner of capital raising
that increases for these firms in poor economic times is private placements of equity and debt. These
results are consistent with the view that when macroeconomic conditions worsen, the supply of capital
shifts and relatively poor quality firms cannot issue capital publicly but instead have to rely on private
placements.
However, the supply of capital does not appear to decline for higher-rated firms during poor
macroeconomic conditions. For higher-rated, investment-grade firms, public equity issues have no
relation with the business cycle, while public bond issuances and private loans actually increase with poor
financial conditions. These results are consistent with “flight to quality” arguments, in which uncertainty
about the economic environment increases in downturns, leading investors to prefer lower risk
investments. In addition, they are consistent with “credit crunch” stories like Holmstrom and Tirole
(1997), in which capital becomes scarce during an economic slowdown and is rationed to higher quality
firms.
An implication of these arguments is that during poor economic times, high quality firms’ cost
of capital should be relatively low, and they should raise capital to replenish their liquidity. In contrast,
lower-rated firms face substantial costs to raising capital in poor economic times, so they should only
raise it when necessary and spend whatever capital they raise right away. We examine these predictions,
and find that, consistent with the flight to quality arguments, highly rated firms hold a relatively high

23

proportion of proceeds from the issuance in the form of cash during recessions.. In contrast, low-rated
firms tend to spend most of the capital they raise during poor economic times.
In addition to the choice of securities, we also consider the possibility that macroeconomic factors
affect the structure of securities. In particular, we examine how macroeconomic conditions affect the
maturity and security of the public and private debt issuances. Our results indicate that, holding other
factors fixed, a downturn tends to decrease the expected maturity of both public bonds and private loans
and to increase the likelihood that these loans are secured. These findings can be explained both by
demand-based stories, in which less information-sensitive securities are issued during poor economic times,
and by supply-based ones, in which suppliers of capital require a shorter maturity and more security when
macroeconomic conditions are worse.
Overall, our results are consistent with the view that macroeconomic conditions are important
determinants of the structure of securities issued, and, equally importantly, of the ability of firms to raise
capital at all. The supply of capital available to firms as well as investors’ demand for certain types of
securities appear to be important determinants of the manner in which firms raise capital. These findings
appear to justify the concerns of Passov (2003) that firms without investment-grade bond ratings could
conceivably be shut out of the capital markets during down cycles. Indeed, in the well-known Graham and
Harvey (2001) survey of Chief Financial Officers, the two most common concerns in debt policy were
maintaining financial flexibility and bond ratings (p. 210). Consistent with this survey evidence are
Kisgen (2008) and Hovakimian et al. (2009), who document that firms appear to target bond ratings rather
than debt levels. Our findings suggest that the concern about bond ratings is potentially warranted, since
firms with poor bond ratings potentially are shut out of the capital markets during downturns.

Table II
Macroeconomic Conditions and Security Issues
This table presents the averages of relative proportions of proceeds raised through six types of securities within
each calendar month. The sample includes all SEOs, convertible bonds, other public debt, private loans, and
private placements of both equity and debt issued by US industrial firms that have corresponding accounting
information in Compustat as of the fiscal year-end immediately prior to the issue. Sample period is between
1971 and 2007 for SEOs, convertibles, and other public bonds, 1988 to 2007 for private loans, and 1981 to
2007 for private placements. Expansions and recessions are based on the NBER classification. A month is
defined as low growth if GDP growth in that particular quarter is below the 25th percentile of economic growth
over the entire sample period. A month with weak credit supply takes a value of one if the net percentage of
senior loan officers tightening standards for loans to large and medium firms is positive for that particular
quarter. This classification is based on a Federal Reserve survey available since the 2nd quarter of 1990. For
each calendar month, we first calculate the relative proportions of each of the six security types within that
month. Panel A reports the monthly averages between 1971 to 1987 where private placements are treated as
missing prior to 1981, while panel B reports the corresponding numbers from 1988 to 2007, respectively.

Table III
Macroeconomic Conditions and Types of Public Debt Issues
This table presents the averages of relative proportions of proceeds raised through public debt issues with various characteristics. Short-term
months are those firm-months with proceeds-weighted initial maturities shorter than or equal to 5 years. Short-term debts are only available since
1985. Secured months are those firm-months with proceeds-weighted issue-level secured dummy greater than or equal to 0.5. We group all public
debt into five categories based on credit ratings from Moody’s; not rated, C's(C to Caa1), speculative B's (B3 to Ba1), investable B's (Baa3 to
Baa1), and A's (A3 to Aaa). Expansions and recessions are based on the NBER classification. A month is defined as low growth if GDP growth in
that particular quarter is below the 25th percentile of economic growth over the entire sample period. A month is defined as with weak credit
supply if the net percentage of senior loan officers tightening standards for loans to large and medium firms is positive for that particular quarter,
and is based on Federal Reserve survey. For each calendar month, we first calculate the relative proportions of each of the bond types out of total
proceeds raised from public debt within that month. Panel A reports the monthly averages for the full sample period, while panel B reports the
monthly averages since the 2nd quarter of 1990, when the Federal Reserve survey became available.

Table IV
Firm Characteristics by Security Issues: Univariate Analysis
This table presents the averages of firm characteristics for each non-issuing months as well as issuing months
over the entire sample period. We also report the results separately for six security types. These characteristics
are natural logarithm of the total assets, market leverage, market to book, cash flow, cash, the inverse of interest
coverage, a debt-rating dummy, sales growth, and the stock return. Inverse interest coverage is defined as the
natural logarithm of (1+interest/EBIT) and stock return is calculated over the previous twelve months. Detailed
definition of each characteristic is provided in the Appendix Table 1. Sample period is between 1971 and 2007
for SEOs, convertibles, and other public bonds, 1988 to 2007 for private loans, and 1981 to 2007 for private
placements.

Table V
A Multinomial Logit Model of Security Choice
This table reports coefficient estimates for a multinomial logit model. The dependent variable includes six different types of security issuance: bank
loan, public bond, convertible debt, SEO, and private placements of equity and debt. The base outcome is not issuing any type of security. Variables
are defined in Appendix Table 1. The sample period is from 1988 to 2007. Panel A is for all firms; Panel B is for noninvestment-grade firms only;
and Panel C is for investment grade firms only. We define noninvestment-grade firms as those that never issued an investment-grade public bond
during the entire sample period based on Moody’s ratings.All regressions, except for the ones in Panel C, include industry fixed effects. Standard
errors, corrected for clustering of observations at the firm level, are in parentheses. The symbols ***, ** and * indicate statistical significance at the
1, 5, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table VI
Cash Holdings from Capital Raising Activities
This table presents the estimation results from the following regression specification:
⎡⎛ capital raised ⎞ ⎤
⎡⎛ capital raised ⎞ ⎤
⎟⎟ + 1⎥ + β 2 ln ⎢⎜⎜
⎟⎟ + 1⎥ × RecessionDummy + β3 ln[total assets0 ] + ε ,
Y = β 0 + β1 ln ⎢⎜⎜
⎣⎝ total assets0 ⎠ ⎦
⎣⎝ total assets0 ⎠ ⎦

where Y = ln[((Vt − V0 ) total assets 0 ) + 1] , and V = quarterly cash and short term investments. t = 1, 4, 8
corresponds to the fiscal quarter following the issuing quarter. In the first three rows, all new issues regardless
of type of security are aggregated within a calendar quarter and these quarters are matched with the NBER’s
expansion/recession dates. In the remaining row, we estimate the result separately for each of the security
types. We report the results separately for noninvestment-grade firms and investment-grade firms.
Noninvestment-grade firms are defined as those that never issued an investment grade public bond during the
entire sample period.

Table VII
Factors affecting the Maturity and Security of Public Bonds and Bank Loans: Logit Model
This table reports coefficient estimates for a logit model. Panel A includes only public bond issuances and
their characteristics from 1985 to 2007 in the first three columns (since there is no short-term bond issue
before 1985 in our sample) and from 1971 to 2007 in the last three columns. Panel B includes bank loans
only and the sample period is from 1988 to 2007. In columns (3) and (6) of both panels A and B, where
we include weak credit dummy, the sample period is from the second quarter of 1990 to 2007. The
dependent variable is equal to one if the public debt or bank loan is short-term in columns (1) through (3),
or secured in columns (4) through (6). All regressions include industry fixed effects. Standard errors,
corrected for clustering of observations at the firm level, are in parentheses. The symbols ***, ** and *
indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10% levels, respectively.

Appendix Table 2
A Multinomial Logit Model of Security Choice using Weak Credit Dummy for Downturns
This table reports coefficient estimates for a multinomial logit model as in Table V but using weak credit dummy for downturns. The dependent
variable includes six different types of security issuance: bank loan, public bond, convertible debt, SEO, private placements of equity and debt. The
base outcome is not issuing any type of security. Variables are defined in Appendix Table 1. The sample period is from the second quarter of 1990
to 2007. Panel A is for all firms; Panel B is for noninvestment-grade firms only; and Panel C is for investment grade firms only. All regressions,
except for the ones in Panel C, include industry FEs. Standard errors, corrected for clustering of observations at the firm level, are in parentheses.
The symbols ***, ** and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10% levels, respectively
