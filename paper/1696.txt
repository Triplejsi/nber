Aggregate Supply and Demand
Factors in OECD Unemployment:
An Update

ABSTRACT

The paper analyzes the change in unemployment in 12 OECD countries over
the period 1970—83 in terms of

underlying aggregate supply and demand shifts.

Earlier evidence on wage gaps (given by Bruno and Sachs) is revised and

extended. For most European countries a process of reduction in gaps is
taking place in the 1980's, but the average absolute levels, when weighted by
country size, are still sizeable, thus a 'classical' element of unemployment

remains. However, most of the large additional increase in unemployment after
1980 (as well as the profit

squeeze and investment slowdown) is ascribed to

the contractionary stance of macro policy in Europe, in contrast to the
subsequent expansion and sharp fall of unemployment in the U.S. The large
U.S. deficit coupled with monetary restraint and the resulting dollar
appreciation also account for the sharp difference in the behavior of import
prices in the U.S. and Europe which in turn may explain the considerably
slower inflation deceleration in Europe and the reluctance to expand activity
more rapidly.

AGGREGATE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS

IN OECD UNEMPLOYMENT: AN UPDATE'

Introduction
Unemployment in the OECD countries has continued to rise to unprecedented
levels. The EEC countries, which

on average ended the turbulent l97O's

with an unemployment rate of close to 7 percent are now, in the mid
80's,
approaching an 11 percent level. The U.S. is
for which the changes in

virtually the only country

unemployment during the l970's have not been

systematically upward and for which the 1984

rate was, more or less, back

to where it had been both ten

years and five years earlier (see Figure 1).
The reasons for the sustained
increase in unemployment during the

l97O's as well as the possible

reasons for differences in patterns across

industrial countries have been studied but question marks

undoubtedly

remain. Our own emphasis in an earlier study has been on the combination
of the great supply shocks of the previous decade and the
macro—policy response of most OECD countries
the more recent policy

years that have elapsed and quite a few

percentage points

of additional unemployment there is obviously room for both
an update and
a reappraisal.1

See Bruno and Sachs
(1985). The period covered in that study extended
only up to 1981 for which the
in terms of data for individual
countries was still incomplete.coverage
It is worth Pointing out that between
1981 and 1985 the number
of unemployed in Europe increased by almost 50
percent!

—2—
Starting from a fairly conventional aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) macro—framework

an increase in unemployment may come

about as a result of a leftward shift

of either the AS curve or the AD

curve or a combination thereof (see Figure 2). The first 'pure' case of
a supply shock brings about

both unemployment and inflation and is

generally understood to have characterized the period both immediately
before and after the first oil shock (1973—74), the extent of resulting

stagflation in various countries depending on the extent of real wage
rigidity. Such shift from southwest to northeast in the unemployment—
inflation framework (see Figure 1) has also

characterized the second

oil shock (1979—80). An added leftward bias of the AS curve in the
1970's may have been caused by the depressive effect of the profit
squeeze on capital accumulation. All of these have imparted a
'classical' element to the unemployment which has certainly not been

present in earlier, cyclical unemployment

episodes. However, even the

developments immediately following the two oil shocks cannot be
understood without explicit regard being paid to contractionarY

forces

coming from leftward shifts in the AD schedule-s of countries (see
Figure 2).

The period immediately following the first oil shock (1974—77) certainly looks more like a conventional northwest to southeast movement down
a short—run Phillips curve (see Figure 1). In terms of the story for the

1970's this could be explained as a combination of the depressing effect
of oil and raw material prices on real income, the anti—inflationary

response of macro policy to the first oil shock and the interaction of
depressed world markets on export demand in the individual countries. A
similar story, with some variations, could still be told for 1980—81. From

—3—
that phase onwards the differential movement of unemployment in the U.S.
and Europe has become a central issue which

requires analysis in its own

right.

In the coming sections we take up the main issues pertaining to the

role of AS and AD factors in the

rising unemployment. Section I recon-

siders the concept of the real wage gap, and applies alternative measures

to the data up to and including 1983. Our

general finding is that by the

end of the period considered wage gaps for most countries recorded have
come down from their peak levels in 1979—81, but are still sizable on
average in Europe. Section II takes up the role of the profit squeeze. We
find that while profits have played a very important role in the investment slowdown the main reason for the profit squeeze has come from depressed demand conditions and less from the direct effect of high real wages.
While the slowdown in capital growth may provide an eventual constraint on
rapid growth in the manufacturing sector it is unlikely to be an obstacle
to expansion at the present moment due to excess capacity.
Section III takes a summary overview of the demand for labour in the
manufacturing sector applying a neoclassical demand curve for labour with
some Keynesian AD elements superimposed on it. Section IV reconsiders the

overall unemployment performance of countries in terms of the basic underlying AS and AD components reinforcing the argument that the more recent

rise in unemployment is primarily an AD contraction phenomenon. The last
section (V) discusses the dilemma of individual

country expansion and

reconfirms the argument that there is a serious policy co—ordination problem between the U.S. and Europe in which the large U.S. deficit coupled

with monetary restraint and the European fear of renewed inflation have
simultaneously provided the conditions for rapid U.S. expansion and the

—4—
sluggishness of revival in Europe. The policy proposals recently put

forward,2 calling for co—ordinated, more active expansion in Europe with
some incomes policy hedges, thus receive added support.

I. The Rise and Gradual Fall of Wa&e Gaps

Several studies have produced evidence that for a number of countries
during the 1970s, at least, an important supply factor has been a persistent excess of real wage levels above the marginal product of labour at
full employment.3 It is therefore important to update and reconsider the
evidence from the vantage point of the mid—1980s.
Assuming a well—behaved production function in terms of value added:
V =

F(L,

K; t), and suppose one can measure the marginal product at full

employment (Li), FL(L, K; t). Under output—market clearing and competi-

tive firms (W/P) =

over (W/P) or, in log—

— (w —

in
The notion that the marginal product of labour may mean something

the aggregate or that the aggregate demand for labour may depend on the
real wage is, of course, controversial, mainly because of the competitive
assumption implied for firms. We here proceed under the supposition that

Schadler (1984), McCallum (1984), and OECD Economic Outlook, miscellaneous issues.

—5---

like many artifacts in applied macro—economics, the notion of a wage gap
could, under certain circumstances and with some caveats, perform a useful
diagnostic function. When based on a sub—sector like

manufacturing it may,

perhaps, be less controversial than otherwise, since for most economies
this is a highly tradable industry and one that is reasonably
competitive.

Under a CES production function with elasticity of substitution a

between

L and K the elasticity of demand for labour with respect to

the product wage is C/Ski where

Sk is the capital share in value

added. Thus, a log—linear approximation of the employment shortfall in the
short run (i.e., at given capital stock, k5) due to a positive wage gap
is given by

(1)

d —

(d =

when

wX =

0)

The main problem of measurement lies in estimating the marginal product of labour at full employment. In principle, one could estimate the
production technology directly and calculate

FL for L. Such estimates

must usually assume market clearing on a year—to—year basis, which is
obviously problematic. The alternative procedure followed here is to

suggest a range of estimates of wX under alternative assumptions from
which, it is argued, a general picture nonetheless emerges.

Note that as long as marginal revenues of firms move with prices (i.e.,
there is a constant 'degree of monopoly'), the notion of a wage gap
could still remain valid even under monopolistic competition.
The importance of this caveat will be further clarified below.

—6—
The simplest assumption for calculating wX is the Cobb—Douglas

technology (o

= 1)

for which the marginal product moves parallel to the

average product and the problem then boils down to measuring the gap

between (w —

— 9),

and the trend of the average product at full employment

namely, a corrected relative wage share measure, normalized by

some base—year benchmark. Table 1 gives this first measure for 12 OECD

countries taking the benchmark for wX {= w —

be 0 on

average during the period 1965—69 and taking the average growth rates of

during 1960—73 and 1973—85 to represent the respective "full

employment" trend (v — £

).

The findings based on the simplest measure of the gap suggest that
after a rise in the gap in the early 1970s and a very sharp rise during
the first oil shock, to a weighted average of 11 percent by the end of the
decade, there was a gradual fall in most countries from about 1980 onward.
The move in a downward direction seems to have become more marked during
1982—83. The table also underscores the fact that there are sharp differ-

ences among countries both for the peak years and for the deceleration.
The U.S. and Canada importantly show very little variation during the oil
shock, and only the Netherlands and Sweden were the exception to an otherwise real wage—resistant Europe.7 The U.K. and Belgium stand out as two

While 1960 and 1973 probably represented cyclical peaks, 1983, which is
the last observation in our data, is obviously not. The alternative
followed in Bruno and Sachs (1985) took 1979 to be a cyclical peak and
extrapolated through that year. Both procedures are problematic, and an

countries with large remaining gaps by the end of the period. Japan's 1979
figure, one can argue, is misleading since the reference period, 1965—69,
probably did not reflect an equilibrium in its labour market.8 Anyway, it
shows substantial reduction after 1979.

We consider two major sensitivity tests for the basic measure used in
Table 1, one having to do with the technology and the other with the

—

hypothetical measure of

during

the recent unemployment years.

The first argument against findings based on the simple measure of

wX comes from the assumed

unitary elasticity of substitution. We know

that when a < 1 a rise in real wages will also show in a rising labour
share in value—added, which would have nothing to do with disequilibrium.

The sharpness of the rise in wX in the mid—19705 and its subsequent fall
towards the early l980s would cast doubt on such explanation, but it is

nonetheless important to see how sensitive this result is to the size of

a. Various recent studies of the production function

for manufacturing

across countries suggest the assumption of Harrod—neutral technical

progress and a range of estimates of a between 0.5 and 1, with an
average of about

and again applying it to the trend between the 'peak' years 1960, 1973,
1983.

The above approximation obviously requires knowledge of capital stock
figures, which were available for only 8 of the countries in question. The
last three lines of Table 1 give a summary average estimate for these 8
countries (Belgium, Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands are excluded here)

for the 3 assumptions on 0, from which we can see that the 1979 and 1981
peak estimates of wX are only slightly modified. There is a somewhat
larger difference in the subsequent years —

the

smaller a,

the

larger is

the estimated reduction in the gap by 1982. There are, of course, differ-

ences for individual countries (these data are not reproduced here), but
the general result holds on average.

The second sensitivity test involves an alternative estimate for

which attempts to correct for the effect of the unemployment

level and changes thereof on full employment productivity growth. The

method used" was to run for each country a regression of labour productivity on unemployment, the current and lagged change in unemployment and

The resulting adjusted estimates are given in Table 2. It
is inter—
esting to note that on the whole the

previous general finding remains

intact, both concerning the size of the increase in 1976 and the
gradual
fall after 1979. The two
extreme cases, Belgium and the United Kingdom,
now look even worse, and it
seems that France too is in much worse shape
once the correction for
unemployment is made. We note that the
weighted
mean for Europe, when Belgium and the U.K. are excluded, shows
a lower
peak but only a very mild slowdown.

An important question that arises relates to the
sources of these
changes in the measured
wage gap. At least a partial answer is
provided by
a breakdown of changes in the
wage gap (*X) into the parts attributable to

II. The Role of the Profit Sgueez

data shown in the last section

The general picture that emerges from the
suggests that during the depression years

of the early 1980s the wage gap

has most probably been reduced in all but two or three countries. What
this implies is that at given capital stock levels (providing the estimated wage gap is also applicable to the

whole economy, and not only to

the manufacturing sector), the demand for labour would come closer to

maintenance of full employment. The emphasis on the word given is important because both the labour force and the capital stock normally grow at
some balanced rate from which we have abstracted so far. The point is that
when the capital stock levels depart from their previous growth paths this
could be an additional argument for a gap between
employment, quite apart from Keynesian arguments

labour demand and full
to which we turn later. A

fall in investment demand could be linked to a profit squeeze which, in
itself, may have been caused by an increase in the price of other factors
of production (material inputs and labour), by

depressed demand condi-

tions, or (as in fact was the case) by a combination of both.
In the absence of full—fledged investment

demand functions based on a

q—measure of rationally expected profits, we here apply a rather simple—

— 11 —

minded approach in which capital stock
of past profits (a three—year

average is used in the data below) and the

real rate of interest. The real
function of the real product

growth is expressed as a function

rate of profit, in turn, is expressed as a

wage (based on the factor—price_frontier)

and

a measure of demand pressure.

Let r denote the logarithm of the real rate of
profit (where profits are deflated by GDP prices and the capital stock
by investment goods

prices) and w the logarithm of

the product wage. A log—linear

mation of the factor price frontier

approxi-

(FPF) can be written In the form

(5)

where

a1 should equal minus the ratio of the labour and

capital shares,

and A is the labour

augmenting technical progress parameter (for the
case of Harrod—neutral technical
progress which is assumed here).

For deviations from the FPF due to short—term demand
fluctuations we
add a term
a2d to equation (5) and also allow for a drop in productivity
growth after 1974 by adding

estimation. The regression

a slope dummy (D7582) to the equation for

12

This procedure was followed in a recent OECD memo. We also
experimented
with monetary, fiscal, and world—trade variables to
represent
aggregate
demand (see below). For some countries, the unemployment
rate as well
as its first difference,
using two—stage least squares for w, serves
the same purpose. Broadly
similar results are obtained, but
d seems
a better aggregate
proxy for all countries. For the basis of
adding

demand variable to the FPF

works reasonably well.

cant. As to its relative size, the average for the eight countries,

seems reasonable as it implies a

labour share of 0.62. The average elasti-

city for the d coefficient (a2) is 3.02. The implied technical progress
coefficients can be got from the ratio —a3/a1

a4 after

(corrected by the slope

74) for the various countries. Running a cross—section regres-

sion for the first differences of all countries (with country intercept
dummies) gives a lower coefficient for the wage elasticity (—0.82 with
with s.e.
s.e. 0.27) and about the same for the output coefficient (2.69

0.19), the 2 for the overall regression

(136 observations) is 0.62.

Next consider the relationship between investment and profits. A

glance at the average data by

sub—period suggests that the slowdown in

capital accumulation both across countries and over time is correlated
with the extent of the profit squeeze. A cross—section regression of
period averages for the rate of change of the capital stock with the

the following
average rate of profit and the real rate of interest gives
two alternative regressions for a linear or logarithmic specification (the
countries = 32 observations):

Both equations show a very strong effect of the profit
rate and an
insignificant effect of the real rate of interest. The
behind the former could be via the effect

of present profit rates on the

expectations of future profits or else may be a the result of financing
constraint on firms which enhances investment from
the latter increase. Whichever the channel

retained earnings when

it is obviously a strong rela-

tionship. It is further borne out by individual

country regressions given

in Table 5. These are based on annual data and a logarithmic specification
(with the exception of the U.K. in which only the linear form gave significant results). There the profit variable ()

stands for the log average

profit rate for the last three years.
Table 5 shows the elasticity of

capital stock growth with respect to

profits to be highly significant in almost all cases (the U.S. is a
possible exception), the average value being 1.46. The coefficient for the
real interest rate is

significantly negative in only three cases'3 (only
one case with a significantly positive
coefficient, France, makes no
economic sense).

Writing the investment equation in the form
(7)

and substituting for

from r in equation (5) we can express the

growth in the capital stock as a function of the

real product wage

(level), the demand variable (d) and the real interest rate (leaving out
time shifts):

13

The limited role of interest rates may be due to the fact that
they
are much more volatile than profits [see Iieda and Yoshikawa (1985)].

Looking at the size of the implied elasticities and the actual change
in the underlying variables one major conclusion emerges —

the

real wage

could not but have a relatively small direct role in the slowdown of
capital accumulation while the output contraction (from the demand side)
played the dominant role in the profit squeeze and the resulting contrac—
tion in investment.

The product of the average a1 (1.6) and the average b1 (1.5) gives an

elasticity of 2.4. A permanent increase in w of 5 percent over its
equilibrium level would thus imply a fall in k of 12 percent.14 We know
from Section I that in the mid 70's there were temporary increases of w,
which on average were twice that but by the beginning of the 1980's the
gap for most countries had already come down substantially. At the same
time the rate of growth of the capital stock was cut to less than half its
rate over the decade for most european countries for which data are recor-

ded here. The total elasticity for the d variable, on the other hand
(b1a2), amounts to 4.5 and the relative fall in its level over the period
was of the order of 20 percent ,thus being capable of 'explaining' drops
of up to 90 percent in k.

This general assessment of the relative importance of the two factors
(as well as a minute role for the real rate of interest) also emerges when
an analysis of components is carried out by individual country (not reproduced here). We may thus conclude that while the profit squeeze probably

The average product of a1b1 (rather than the product of the averages)
is 2.22. The highest product of a1b1 by half the wage gap in 1976 (see
Table 1), from among the eight countries recorded, is 0.24 for Germany
with all other countries far below that.

— 15 —

played an important role in the investment slowdown, for most countries
and for most of the time, high real wages played only a small direct role
in the latter. Indirectly, of course, the contractionary bias of macro-

economic policy was probably related to wage rigidity (fear of inflation),
but this is another matter to which we shall return. First we take a
summary overview of the factors affecting employment in manufacturing.

a summary view of the factors affecting employment in manufac—

turing we modify the conventional demand curve for labour by

[2, — 2,

for aggregate demand factors. For the latter three variables were used —

the

government deficit (df, corrected for full employment and inflation),

deviations from the trend in world trade (d) and the real money stock
(m, lagged). For most countries there is considerable positive correlation
between the fiscal and monetary variables and only for the U.S., where the

two conflicted, did the monetary variable play an important separate role
(M2 was used and the world trade variable was not included). The log
linear equation that was fitted for most countries (see Table 6) is the
following:

We note that with the exception of the U.S. and Canada all other

— 16 —

countries

show significant negative coefficients for the product wage

variable. The 'long—run' elasticity (but at given capital stock) of labour
demand varies from about one half for Belgium and Norway to two and above
for Japan, Denmark, France and the Netherlands (these values are obtained

by dividing c2 by 1—c1). The implied elasticity of substitution can be
obtained by multiplication of these values by the share of capital which
for most countries is of the order of 1/3 (somewhat higher for Japan). The
world trade variable is significantly positive in most cases as is the
deficit variable for those countries for which data could be included.
The direct role attributed to aggregate demand in these regressions
is certainly not negligible and if we add the indirect role working
through the investment slowdown it is quite sizable. In the way we have
specified the model it is constrained to show constant returns to scale in
labour and capital and thus any factor accounting for a 1 percent cut in
the rate of change of k also, ceteris paribus, indirectly accounts for the
same in terms of the rate of change in manhours. At the same time,the fact
that the demand slowdown played a direct role in the regression provides
evidence that by the end of that period (after considerable demand slowdown) there was probably no capacity constraint. This is also borne out by
direct measurements of capacity utilisation [see European Community
business surveys quoted in European Economy, 1983, and in Layard et al.
(1984)].

IV. An Analysis of Overall Unemployment

So far the analysis dealt only with the manufacturing sector. There are
obvious advantages to a consideration of that sector both for analytical

— 17 —

reasons (a neoclassical labour demand framework is more defensible for
this sector, at least in a typical European open economy context) and
because such data as product wages and capital input are more readily
available. We do not, at the moment, have a

satisfactory aggregate macro-

economic model formally combining demand and supply factors in a way that
could be used for econometric estimation of labour

demand, especially in

an imperfectly competitive setting. In the absence thereof, we make do
with an ad—hoc formulation, which follows the logic of the preceding

discussion

and could also be given justification

adjustment

to aggregate demand and aggregate supply within a disequilib-

on the basis

of gradual

rium setting.'5
We write down a reduced form in which unemployment is expressed as a
function of the lagged real wage gap, and the aggregate demand factors
with two lags for each. The more distant lags could be rationalized on the
basis of delayed effects working either on the aggregate demand schedule
or via profitability and capital investment on the aggregate supply side.
It is in that 'hybrid' sense that the results of Table 7 should be interpreted.

Table 7 presents unemployment

regressions for eight countries. Only in

the case of the U.S. both the monetary and fiscal variables appear (without the world trade variable). In the case of the other countries the
addition of a fiscal variable did not make any significant difference and
the lagged real money stock variables seemed to do all of the action on
the domestic demand side.'6 We note that the signs of coefficients are, in
See Bruno and Sachs (1985), chap. 10.
We have no explanation as to why the fiscal variable seems to perform
better in the manufacturing labour demand equation and the monetary
variable works better here.

most cases, the 'right' ones,17 although they are not always significant
at the 1 percent level.

Because of the statistical problems that are attached to this type of
single equation estimation for each country, there is some advantage to

also taking an overall cross—section view of the rise in unemployment
using the same underlying model. The following is the resulting regression
(20 years x 8 countries = 160 observations) of first differences:

With the exception of the second lag on money (which could be left
out), all coefficients have the right sign and are highly significant
(numbers in brackets are standard errors of coefficients). The assumption
underlying (10), that the elasticities are the same across countries, is,
of course, problematic, but it is reassuring to find such a strong overall
qualitative result. If one adds dummy variables for countries and/or each
time period, none of these dummies come out significant, and the overall
regression is not improved.

The average quantitative implications that could be read into the
regression is that for each 1 percent rise (fall) in the wage gap, the
unemployment rate rises (falls) by 0.15 percent within two years, while

17 Only one of the 16 coefficients of the wage gap is significantly nega-

tive, for the case of the regression for France which is suspect anyway
(see discussion below). Most of the coefficients on the demand variables are negative as expected.

— 19 —

for

each 1 percent drop in the rate of growth in real money stock,

unemployment rises by 0.06 percent after a year.

Consider, for example, the average drop in real money growth between
1974—78 and 1978—82, which was about 4 percent in annual average terms.
The regression would thus attribute an annual average rise of 0.24 percent
in the unemployment rate to this factor alone in the last period.'8
Table 8 gives a summary analysis of the analogous regressions that
were based on the adjusted wage gap measure (these regressions are not
reported here). It indicates the role of the major factors accounting for
the increase in unemployment in each country. For each period the average
cumulative change in the average unemployment rate since 1965—69 is given,

as well as the estimated role of the adjusted wage gap (with its two lags)
and the sum total of the aggregate demand factors. The table reinforces
the earlier finding that wages played an important role mainly in the mid—
seventies and primarily for three of the countries recorded (the U.K.,
Belgium and Denmark) and that its relative importance for most countries
diminished during the last sub—period, 1978—82, where most of the
incremental increase in unemployment can be attributed to aggregate demand
shifts (subtract the second column of Table 8 from the third or fourth
column). However, by 1982 the average remaining effect of the wage factor

sèk remained high for the 5 European countries recorded in this table.

18

The 'world trade' factor here
appears separately, although it, too,
could ultimately, in a world model, be attributed to 'domestic' contraction in all countries combined. Its implied response coefficient of
0.16 'explains' a rise in unemployment of 0.4 percent annually during
1974—78 and 0.3 percent during 1978—82.

— 20 —

V. Inflation, Exchange Rates and the Co—ordination Problem

The previous discussion has highlighted the dominant role of contraction—
ary macro—policy in the recent further rise of unemployment in Europe.

The same framework is also consistent with the concomitant fall in unemployment in the U.S., given the extensive fiscal expansion in that country
since 1981. We conclude the discussion by noting that it is the combination of fiscal expansion and monetary contraction in the U.S. which, at
least in part, may indirectly account for the reluctance to expand in
Europe on account of sluggish inflation deceleration. The causal link is
provided by exchange rate developments during the same period.
The rise in real interest rates and net capital flows into the U.S.
account for the large dollar appreciation since the beginning of 1981 (of
the order of 50 percent nominal and 38 percent in real terms). This has

had a dramatic effect on the relative import price developments in the
U.S. as compared to Europe which, we would argue, is the dominant reason

for the differential inflation performance on the two sides of the Atlantic (see Figure 1).19 The evidence for this is so striking that it is hard
to understand why it often gets overlooked.
Consider the following two sets of numbers for annual rates of change
in import prices and consumer prices for the U.S. and the average for the
EEC countries since 1980:

19

The drop in world relative commodity prices is the dominant factor in
the overall inflation slowdown while exchange rates have respectively
enhanced or weakened their effect. For cross—section analyses of Inflation in the OECD countries emphasizing the key role of import prices
and exchange rates see Bruno (1980), and Beckerman and Jenkinson
(1984). See also Gordon (1977).

A simple reduced form inflation equation for the years 1961—80 (based
on a pooled

regression prepared two years ago) gives a fairly close post—

sample prediction of 1982—84 developments for both the U.S. and the EEC.

It considers the inflation rate as a sum of lagged inflation (with a
coefficient of 0.66) and current import price change (with a coefficient
of 0.18) along with a capacity term which is ignored here. This gives the
predicted rates of 7.1, 3.9, 2.7 for the U.S. during 1982—84 and 9.0, 7.6,
6.9 for EEC. The predicted mean inflation

during 1982—84 for the U.S. and

EEC is 4.6 and 7.8, respectively, while the actual rates were 4.6 and 7.9,
not a bad £ it, on the average.

The real depreciation of European currencies relative to the dollar
thus explains why inflation slowed down so much less fast on the European
continent. It may also help to explain why Europe as a whole was reluctant
to expand and rather adopted contractionary macro policies until very
recently. These helped to support the slowdown in inflation but at a for—
inidable cost in terms of unemployment. Each country by itself will not

expand because it risks running into balance of payments problems and
added pressure on its exchange rate (with inflationary consequences) and
for all countries to expand simultaneously requires more co—ordination
than seems politically feasible, especially since the U.S. must agree to

— 22 —

cut its own fiscal deficit pan passu. A turn around in exchange rates,
such as occurred in 1985, could of course alleviate some of the pressure.
On the other hand, too rapid expansion in the OECD countries as a whole

would risk the possibility that relative prices of industrial raw
materials will rise again, but it is a trade—off worth considering.
