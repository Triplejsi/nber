Household Debt and Saving During the 2007 Recession

NBER Working Paper No. 16999
April 2011
JEL No. D12,D14,D91,G01
ABSTRACT
Using administrative credit report records and data collected through several special household surveys
we analyze changes in household debt and savings during the 2007 recession. We find that while different
segments of the population were affected in distinct ways, depending on whether they owned a home,
whether they owned stocks and whether they had secure jobs, the crisis’ impact appears to have been
widespread, affecting large shares of households across all age, income and education groups. In response
to their deteriorated financial situation, households reduced their average spending and increased saving.
The latter increase – at least in 2009 – did not materialize itself through an increase in contributions
to retirement and savings accounts. If anything, such contributions actually declined on average during
that year. Instead, the higher saving rate appears to reflect a considerable decline in household debt,
with households paying down mortgage debt in particular. At the end of 2009 individuals expected
to continue to increase saving and pay down debt, which is consistent with what we have observed
so far in 2010. In contrast, consumers were pessimistic about the availability of credit, with credit
expected to become harder to obtain during 2010.

1. Introduction
During the 2007 recession many households saw their wealth decline sharply and
their income and employment opportunities deteriorate. In this paper we use
microeconomic data to analyze changes in household financial decisions during this
period and in particular changes in household saving and debt. More specifically, we
focus on the following three questions: What is the nature and prevalence of financial
distress and how does it vary across households? How have households responded to
these new economic conditions? What are consumers’ expectations about future
economic outcomes and their future financial behaviors?
Our analysis in this paper is based on several unique data sources. First, the
FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel, which is based on credit report records, provides
detailed insights into developments at the liability side of household balance sheets since
1999. Second, we use information on household financial decisions and expectations,
such as on spending and saving, from several recent household surveys. We analyze
survey evidence collected between November 2008 and February 2009 by RAND to
assess the impact of the financial crisis. 2 In addition, and of particular importance for this
study, we analyze data we collected ourselves through a special survey on saving,
administered between the end of October 2009 and January 2010 as part of the
Household Inflation Expectations Project. 3 Both the RAND and NYFed surveys were
administered as part of the RAND American Life Panel (ALP), an internet-based survey.
Brief descriptions of the ALP and the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel are provided in the
Appendix. We also verified some of our findings using data from the Consumer Finance
Monthly (CFM), a monthly telephone survey conducted by Ohio State University since
2005.
We begin in section 2 with an analysis of the extent and nature of the impact of
the financial and economic crisis on households. We focus on four main channels,
distinguishing between changes in the housing market, stock market, labor market and
credit market. In section 3 we evaluate the different ways in which households have
responded to these changes in their economic environment. We then assess individuals’
expectations regarding future conditions and behavior in section 4, and provide a brief
summary in section 5.

related and additional findings from this survey, as well as a number of follow-up surveys, are provided in

2. The Nature and Prevalence of Financial Distress during the Recession
a. The housing market
Perhaps the most defining aspect of the 2007 recession, and by many considered
to be the origin of the financial crisis, has been the decline in the housing market. As
shown in Chart 1, since reaching a peak in April 2007, by the end of 2009 US house
prices as measured by the FHFA home price index had fallen 13% nationwide. 4 This
overall decrease masks considerable variation across states and metropolitan areas. For
example, average prices dropped by respectively 39% and 38% from their peaks in
California and Florida, while average home prices fell by 4% in Colorado and increased
by 1% in Texas.
The large increase in home prices up to 2007 (an increase of 44% from 2002
levels) and the decline since then implies that home value losses experienced by
consumers depend greatly on when a home was purchased. Overall in nominal terms only
for those who bought their homes in 2005 or later is the average value of their home
currently lower than what they paid for it. As shown in chart 2, those who experienced
the greatest losses in nominal terms were those who bought their homes in 2007. The
average loss by the beginning of 2010 as measured by the FHFA home price index was a
little over 10% for this group. Interestingly, the average self-reported change in house
value for this group was only about 6% in the NYFed survey. This is consistent with
earlier findings in the literature suggesting that individual perceptions of home price
changes generally are more optimistic than suggested by official numbers. 5
An important consequence of the initial increase and subsequent fall in average
house prices for households, not conveyed in Chart 2, is the dramatic fall in home equity.
As shown in Chart 3, with the rise in home prices total equity of homeowners rose.
However, it did so at a much lower rate with homeowner’s equity share in their homes
actually staying relatively constant until the end of 2006. On average for each 1%
increase in home prices, homeowners increased their mortgage debt by 1% (through
higher balances on first mortgages, cash-out refinances, second mortgages and home
equity lines of credit), so that proportionally their equity share in their homes actually
remained constant. When home prices began to fall in 2007, owners’ equity in household
real estate began to fall rapidly from almost $13.5 trillion in 1Q 2006 to a little under
$5.3 trillion in 1Q 2009, a decline in total home equity of over 60%. At the end of 2009
owner’s equity was estimated at $6.3 trillion, still more than 50% below its 2006 peak.
4

Other indices, such as the CoreLogic HPI and S&P/Case-Shiller HPIs showed even larger average
declines of up to 30% during this period.
5
Note that those individuals who bought their homes in 2009 perceived on average that their homes had
increased in value by 6.5% at the end of 2009 (although the median reported change was 0%).

2

With the loss in home equity, a growing proportion of homeowners in fact lost all
equity in their homes, finding the mortgage debt on their property to exceed its current
market value. While the decline in house prices was accompanied by a small decline in
the overall home ownership rate 6, the “effective homeownership rate” as defined in
Haughwout et. al. (2010) as the proportion of individuals with a positive amount of home
equity fell since 2007 by more than 7 percentage points (Chart 4) 7.
Exposure to declines in housing values varied not only geographically, but also
across different age and income groups. As shown in Table 1, ownership rates during the
survey period (November 2009-January 2010) varied from 58% for those under 40, to
78% among those aged 40 to 55, and 84% for those older than 55. 8 Homeownership rates
also increased monotonically with household income, with 50% of those with incomes
under $30K owning a home, while 91% did so among those earning more than $75K.
The home ownership rate among college graduates was 80%, while in what we refer to as
the “bubble states”, the five states that experienced the largest housing booms and/or
busts, the rate was 68%, slightly below the overall sample mean of 72%. 9
As shown in Table 1, the average and median perceived price declines during the
year preceding the interview date varied little by age, education and income, but were
considerably larger in the bubble states, in which prices during the past year were
believed to have fallen on average by almost 10 percent. Similarly, the proportion of
people who perceived the current value of their home to be lower than what they paid for
it was 35% in the bubble states, whereas for the country as a whole it was 24%. The rate
was also higher among homeowners under age 40 and those with incomes under $30,000,
of whom a much higher proportion bought their homes after 2005.
Reflecting a greater share of homeowners who have paid off their mortgages, the
proportion of owners who have an outstanding balance on their mortgage is much lower
amongst older individuals. Among homeowners with mortgages, at the end of 2009, 21%
reported to be “underwater” at the time of the survey, with the fraction being the highest

6

After reaching a peak in 2004, by early 2010 the home ownership rate in the US had declined by almost 2
percentage points from around 69% to 67%. The decline was greatest among younger age groups, varying
from 3% for those younger than 35, 4% for those aged 35-45, 3% for those ages 45-55, and a little over 1%
for those over 65 (Census Bureau, Homeownership by age of householder, NSA).

among those under age 40 (31%) and those living in the bubble states (29%). 10 As
shown in Table 2, these higher proportions of individuals who report to be under water on
their mortgages partly reflect a greater share of homeowners who bought their homes
after 2005. However, it also reflects how much equity was taken out by owners during
the housing boom, with the proportion with negative equity being much larger among
those with higher mortgage debt. Finally, the share of mortgage holders under water is
much higher among investors, defined here as those with three or more first mortgages.
This is consistent with ongoing research based on the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel,
showing that while historically lower, delinquency rates among this group has recently
been much higher than that for non-investors.
In summary, the direct impact of the housing crisis has been confined to home
owners, who are on average somewhat older and have higher incomes than renters.
Among owners, many saw considerable gains in housing wealth evaporate during the
recession, with those who bought their homes after 2005 (on average younger and with
lower incomes) and those living in one of the bubble states experiencing the largest
nominal losses and most likely to currently be under water on their mortgage. Ultimately,
the impact of the decline in the housing market on a specific household’s financial
situation and behavior will depend on many factors, including where the house is located,
when the house was bought, how it was financed, how much equity was extracted during
the housing boom, the owner’s ability to make mortgage payments and on how long the
household plans to live in the home.

b. The stock market
In addition to significant losses in housing wealth during the 2007 recession,
many households experienced considerable losses in their stock market wealth following
the stock market crash in October 2008. As measured by the S&P 500 Index, after falling
more than 45% between the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2009, the stock market has
rebounded somewhat but stocks at the end of 2009 remained approximately 27% below
their peak values (Chart 5).
Not all households were directly affected by this drop in stock values, with
exposure varying considerably across households. Based on the 2007 Survey of
Consumer Finances, stock market participation rates as measured by the proportion of
10

A homeowner is defined to be underwater if they answered no to the question “If you sold your home
today, would the proceeds be sufficient to pay off all mortgage loans and any costs of completing the sale?”
The overall rate of 21% is comparable to that computed by First American CoreLogic, which reported that
more than 11.3 million, or 24 percent, of all residential properties with mortgages were in negative equity
at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 (First American CoreLogic Q4 2009 Negative Equity Report,2010).

families holding stocks directly or indirectly (through mutual funds in pension accounts)
increases monotonically with income from less than 14% for those in the bottom income
quintile to 91% in the top decile (Table 3). A similar positive relationship with income is
found for the average and median stock value held by stock market participants. The
participation rate, as well as the median stock value held among participants has a bellshaped relationship with respect to the age of the household head. Reflecting a lower
average income, stock market exposure was also much lower on average for renters.
The same patterns exhibited by the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances also show
up in responses to the 2008 RAND survey shown in Table 4. In November 2008, 58% of
households reported to directly or indirectly own stocks at a median value of $40,000.
Approximately 90% of stockholders reported a loss in the overall value of their stocks
since October 1, 2008, with 38% reporting losses over 30 percent. Both rates show very
little variation across demographic groups. During a period in which on average the S&P
500 index fell by 24 percent, those reporting positive stock holdings reported a median
25% decline in stock value between Oct 1 2008 and the interview date in November
2008, corresponding to a median loss in value of $12,000. 11 Some 38% of stockholders
reported losses of over 30 percent. While there was little variation in percentage losses
across demographic groups, a percentage loss of 25% translates into very different dollar
values, varying between $4,000 for stockholders under age 40 and those with lower
incomes (incomes under $30,000), and $25,000 for stockholders over 55 and with high
incomes (incomes over $75,000).
The patterns for stock ownership found in the RAND survey are consistent with
those for pension plan participation in the NYFed survey. Older individuals and higher
income individuals are twice as likely (about 50% versus 25%) to report that they or their
spouse currently are, or ever have been enrolled in a Defined Benefit pension plan.
Similarly, 86 percent of individuals with household incomes over $75,000 report that
they or their spouse currently are or ever have been enrolled in a Defined Contribution
plan (such as a 401K, individual retirement account (IRA), tax deferred annuity or
403(b), 457 thrift savings plan), while only 38 percent reported so for individuals with
incomes under $30,000. Across age groups we find an inverted-U pattern, with 56% of
individuals under age 40 having such a pension plan, 78% of individuals between ages 40
and 55, and 65% of individuals older than 55 ever or currently participating in such a
plan. Thus the decline in the stock market is most likely to have affected middle and
older age individuals and those with higher household incomes.

11

Averaged over all the daily closings during November 2008, the S&P500 had fallen on average by 24%
since October 1 2008.

c. The labor market
Since the recession began, the unemployment rate increased by more than 5
percentage points to 10% at the end of 2009, while the proportion of those marginally
attached to the labor force (which includes the unemployed as well as those involuntarily
working part-time) increased from about 8% in 2007 to 17% at the end of 2009. As
shown in Chart 6, during the past two years there also was a considerable fall in the
average weekly hours of work.
Not surprisingly, these patterns are reflected in the trends for personal income,
calculated by the National Income and Product Accounts. As shown in Chart 7, between
the end of 2007 and the end of 2009 per-capita real personal income fell by 3.8% with
total compensation and wages falling respectively by 5.8% and 6.7% during this period.
However, as also shown in the chart, per-capita disposable income remained relatively
constant during this period, due to a drop in personal taxes.
Not all households were equally affected by the decline in the labor market. As
shown in Table 5, unemployment rates as reported in the NYFed survey at the end of
2009 varied considerably by age and geography with younger individuals and those
living in the bubble states more likely to be unemployed at the time of the survey. 12 Not
surprisingly, unemployment was also more prevalent in (and a cause of) lower income
households. The same patterns are found for spousal unemployment -- 8% of respondents
report a job loss by a spouse during the past 12 months. During the survey period, in 14%
of households either the respondent was currently unemployed and/or had a spouse who
had been laid off during the past year. In addition to losing jobs, significant proportions
of respondents reported incurring a pay cut (15%), having to take unpaid furlough days
off (7%), losing 401K matching (8%) and reductions in health benefits (14%) during the
last 12 month. Home owners, individuals over age 55 and those with household incomes
over $75,000 were less likely to report pay cuts or reductions in health benefits.
As reported in Table 5, the combined impact of employment losses and wage cuts
led to an overall average decrease in pre-tax household income of about 3.9% during
2009, with 19% of individuals reporting losses of 10% of income or higher. While all
demographic groups suffered income losses during the past year, the losses were greatest
among the 40-55 age group (average decline of 5.8%) and among individuals living in
bubble states (4.7%).

12

The lower overall unemployment rate of 7% in the NYFed sample compared to a national rate closer to
10% at the end of 2009, may be due to a difference between what individuals believe constitutes being
unemployed and how unemployment is officially measured. It may also reflect a lower survey response rate
among the unemployed.

6

d. Credit markets
During a recession in which most interest rates on personal loans fell, the most
significant change in the credit markets was an overall decline in demand for and a
tightening in the supply of credit. 13 As shown in Chart 8, reflecting an overall sharp
decline in the average loan-to-value ratio of new mortgage loans, the proportion of all
mortgage originations with loan/price ratios over 90% dropped steadily from 31% in the
middle of 2007 to about 7% of new mortgages at the end of 2009. 14 At the same time the
proportion of refinances involving a cash-out dropped dramatically from over 70% of
refinances in early 2006 to 35% of refinances at the end of 2009. 15
Another striking change during the past year has been a decline in the number of
loan accounts opened and a sharp increase in the number of accounts closed. As shown in
Chart 9, the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel indicates that about 319 million accounts
were closed during 2009, while just 166 million were opened. Credit cards have been the
primary source of these reductions: the number of open credit card accounts fell to 394
million by the end of December 2009, a decrease of 78 million (16.5%) from a year
earlier and 20.5% from the peak in 2008Q2.
Additional insight into the apparent tightening of credit and closing of accounts is
provided in Table 6. During the survey period at the end of 2009, 57% of respondents
perceived that it had become more difficult to obtain credit compared to a year earlier,
while only 12% thought it had become easier. Little variation shows up in these
responses across age and income groups. While 36% of respondents reported to have
closed a credit card account during the past year at their own request, 13% reported to
have had one of their credit card accounts closed by the bank or credit card company,
with the proportion being highest among younger and lower-income respondents and
among those living in one of the bubble states. 16

13

At the end of 2009, while average rates on credit cards were comparable to those at the end of 2007,
interest rates on fixed rate 30-yr mortgage loans, 48-month new car loans and 24-month personal loans on
average all had fallen by a little over one percentage point since the end of 2007.
14
After a gradual increase in the average loan-to-value ratio on all mortgage loans which came to a halt at
the end of 2007, by the end of 2009 it had fallen back to 73.9%, a level not seen since early 2004 (FHFA).
15
During the same period, total cash-out dollars as a proportion of aggregate refinanced originations
dropped from about 30% to 6% (FHFA).
16
Additional survey data collected by the FRBNY between December 2009 and January 2010 indicated
that about twice as many credit card accounts were closed at the customer’s request than were closed at the
banks’ initiative. Of all cards closed (at own request or not), 43% had a zero balance at the time of closing.

7

Finally, approximately equal proportions of respondents reported increases and
decreases in the combined total credit limit on their combined credit cards. Decreases
were more prevalent for the highest income group and those living in bubble states, while
they were less prevalent among the lowest income group (for whom credit limits are
likely to have been low to begin with). Increases in credit limits were instead more likely
to be reported by those under age 40 and with incomes in the $30,000-$75,000 range.

e. Measures of Overall Distress
The reported microeconomic evidence of considerable declines in housing and
stock market wealth is consistent with the large drop in per-capita net worth calculated by
the Flow of Funds Accounts and shown in Chart 10. Given the decline in net worth as
well as the weak labor market, it is not surprising that since the middle of 2008 a majority
of respondents in the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers considered
themselves to be worse off financially than a year earlier. During the past year only about
20% report that they (and their family) are better off financially than they were a year ago
(Chart 11). When differentiating by age (not shown), we find these trends to apply
equally to all age groups, except that overall ratings of changes in one’s personal
financial situation are persistently somewhat higher (less negative) for younger and lower
(more negative) for older individuals.
As shown in Table 7, about 68% of consumers in the RAND survey reported in
November 2008 that they had been affected “somewhat” or “a lot” by the crisis. The
proportion of individuals who reported to have been affected a lot, was greatest among
the 40 to 55 age group and among individuals living in one of the housing crisis states. In
the November 2008 survey, a little under half of the respondents reported to be worse of
financially relative to a year ago, with older and lower-income individuals more likely to
report to be worse off than younger and higher income individuals.
An alternative and arguably more objective measure of financial stress can be
derived based on some of the RAND survey findings discussed earlier. In November
2008, about one third of all individuals reported at least one of three indicators of
financial distress: self or spouse unemployed, have negative equity in their home, lost
more than 30% of their retirement savings. While unemployment and negative home
equity were more concentrated among younger individuals, large retirement savings
losses were more common among those 40 years of age or older, and especially among
the 40-55 age group. Comparing across income groups, we find that while unemployment
was more frequently experienced by individuals in low-income families, negative equity
and large retirement savings losses were instead much more common in higher-income
households. The same is true when comparing those with and without college degrees.

8

Finally, while individuals living in the bubble states were equally likely to report large
retirement savings losses as those in other states, they were much more likely to be
unemployed and under water at the end of 2008.
During the November 2009-January 2010 interview period, large proportions of
respondents in the NYFed survey continued to report deteriorating personal financial
conditions, with 36% reporting being worse off and only 13% reporting being better off
than a year earlier. As in the end-of-2008 RAND survey, a larger fraction of individuals
in the 40 to 55 age range reported worsening conditions. About a third of respondents
reported to have experienced one of three types of financial distress: currently
unemployed or have a spouse who lost his/her job during the past year, experienced a
drop in household income over 10% compared to the previous year, or currently being
underwater on their mortgage. The proportion reporting at least one of these types of
distress is somewhat higher among those younger than 40 (39%) and with incomes in the
$30,000 to $75,000 range (37%), and lowest among individuals over age 55 (23%) and
with incomes above $75,000 (28%).
All in all, the survey evidence indicates that while different segments of the
population were affected in distinct ways, depending on whether they owned a home (and
when they bought it and where it was located), whether they owned stocks and whether
they had secure jobs, the crisis’ impact appears to have been widespread, affecting large
shares of households across all age, income and education groups.

3. How did households respond to the changes in economic conditions?
After investigating the nature and prevalence of deteriorating economic
conditions during the 2007 recession, we focus next on how households responded to
these changing conditions in their financial decision making. We first discuss changes in
consumer spending behavior, followed by an analysis of changes in saving behavior. In
examining how, at the individual household level, saving behavior may have changed, we
consider the extent to which households changed their allocations to retirement accounts
and how much they added or withdrew funds from other savings accounts. We also
analyze in detail whether and how households reduced or increased their outstanding
mortgage and non-mortgage debt.

a. Consumer Spending

9

After reaching a peak in the fourth quarter of 2007, ending a long period of steady
growth, real personal consumption expenditures were down 3.1% by the second quarter
of 2009 and remained 2.4% below the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009 (Chart 12).
Between the end of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, real personal expenditures on
goods fell by 7.2% (with durable goods expenditures falling 9.9%), expenditures on
services fell by only 1.0%, and expenditures on food and beverages purchased for offpremises consumption fell by 3.1%. 17
Chart 13 provides additional information regarding the sharp drop in spending
that occurred during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Daily
discretionary consumer spending as measured by the Gallup Daily poll dropped 40%
during this period. 18 While consumer spending rebounded somewhat after the first
quarter of 2009, at the end of 2009 it remained about 28% below 3Q 2008 levels. Over
the past two-year period the average percentage change in daily discretionary spending
has been very similar for lower and middle income individuals (defined by Gallup as
incomes below $90,000) and high income individuals (incomes above $90,000).
Evidence from the RAND and NYFed surveys is consistent with these findings.
As shown in Table 8, as stock prices fell sharply, 75 percent of households reduced their
monthly spending between October 1st 2008 and the interview date in November 2008,
with a median cut reported of 20% or about $200. Spending cuts across demographic
groups were similar, except that among individuals 55 years of age or older a somewhat
smaller share reported reductions in spending, and on average reported smaller spending
cuts. Percentage wise, cuts fell with household income, with those with incomes below
$30,000 cutting spending by 25%, while those with incomes above $75,000 cutting
spending by 15%.
At the time of the NYFed survey (fielded between November 2009 and January
2010) a slightly higher proportion of individuals reported their current spending to be
lower compared to a year ago (27%) than the proportion for whom it was higher (22%).
On average households reported spending to be 2.2% lower at the end of 2009 than it was
a year earlier, with those aged 40-55, with incomes under $30,000, and living in a bubble
state reporting larger percentage cuts, while older and higher income individuals making
smaller or no spending cuts (see Table 8). The median change in spending was 0%,
which is broadly consistent with the relatively flat trend in personal consumer

17

Expenditures on goods, services and food at the end of 2009 remained, respectively 5.4%, 0.8% and
1.6% below their levels attained at the end of 2007 (Bureau of Economic Analysis, NIPA).

Discretionary spending in the Gallup poll is defined as the money spent or charged during the previous
day on all types of purchases, such as at a store, restaurant, gas station, online or elsewhere, excluding
purchases of a home, motor vehicle, or normal household bills.

10

expenditures that followed the large drop in spending at the end of 2008 shown earlier in
Chart 12.
Not surprisingly, spending cuts are strongly related to measures of financial
distress. As shown in Table 9, the large majority of those unemployed at the end of 2009
reported cuts in spending during the year, with spending falling on average by more than
18% for this group. Similarly, those who reported household income losses of over 10%
during 2009 and those who reported to be under water on their mortgage reported
spending approximately 10% and 6% less on average compared to a year earlier, cuts
much higher than the 2.2% average decline in spending during this period in our sample.

b. Saving
The relatively stable level of per-capita disposable income shown earlier in Chart
7 combined with what appears to be a persistent drop in personal consumption
expenditures has resulted in a significant and widely reported increase in personal saving
and in the personal saving rate. As shown in Chart 14, the National Income and Products
Accounts (NIPA) Personal Saving Rate as computed by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis increased from historically low levels of around 1 percent in the first quarter of
2008 to recent levels over 6 percent. While the personal saving rate does not directly map
into actual household saving 19, at the microeconomic level, an increase in household
saving could manifest itself as an increase in allocations to retirement and savings
accounts. Alternatively, it could exhibit itself as an increase in allocations used to reduce
or pay off debt, where this could be mortgage debt or debt on other consumer loans, such
as auto, student and credit card loans. In what follows we first present survey evidence on
recent changes in allocations to retirement and other savings accounts. This is followed
by an analysis of survey and administrative data on changes in consumer debt.

b1. Consumer Allocations to Retirement and Other Savings Accounts
In the NYFed survey conducted during the November 2009-January 2010 period,
we asked individuals whether they had made any changes to their retirement account
contributions over the past year. As reported in Table 10, while 11% of all individuals
increased their contributions and 3% started contributing to a retirement account
(including Defined Contribution accounts and IRAs) for the first time, 12% decreased
their contributions, 16% stopped contributing all together and 11% prematurely withdrew
19

For example, the NIPA measure includes income and outlays of non-profit organizations.

11

funds from their accounts. Those who increased their allocations did so by a median
amount of $100 per month, while those who decreased their allocations did so by a
median amount of $150 per month. 20
Not only did more individuals report reducing their contributions to retirement
accounts than increasing their contributions, more individuals also report having
withdrawn funds from other savings accounts (including checking, savings and money
market accounts) than having added funds to them. The proportions of individuals who
reported that they on net withdrew funds during the past year from their checking,
savings and money market accounts exceeded the proportions of respondents who
reported that on net they had added funds to each of these accounts. In contrast
approximately equal proportions reported that they on net had added funds to their stock
market accounts, as had withdrawn funds from stock market accounts. All together 25%
of individuals said they had added more than they used up of their total other (nonretirement) savings during the past year, with a median net annual increase of $5,000.
However, 38% reported that they actually used up more than they added, with a median
reduction of $3,500. Our survey evidence therefore provides little support for the
conjecture that households increased their saving by contributing more to their retirement
and savings accounts.
Some of the observed changes in allocations to retirement and savings accounts
undoubtedly reflect normal life cycle patterns in saving behavior, with retired individuals
stopping to contribute and beginning to draw down their savings and younger individuals
starting to save or to increase their saving as they advance in their careers. Some of the
differences in reported behaviors across age groups in Table 10 indeed seem to reflect
such life cycle effects. However the changes reported in Table 10, and especially the
large proportions of respondents who stopped contributing or who prematurely withdrew
funds during 2009 are much higher than one would expect to see in a more typical year.
The impact of the crisis is clearly reflected in the much higher proportion of
lower-income households who stopped contributing or prematurely withdrew funds from
their retirement accounts and the much lower proportion of households that increased
contributions. These households were also much more likely to have used up more than
they added to their other savings accounts. A higher proportion of higher-income
20

We also asked individuals for the overall percentage change in the total amount of money in their
retirement and other savings accounts over the past year, after including all contributions and withdrawals
during the year as well as changes in the value of funds already in their accounts. Overall respondents
reported an average 3.2% decline in their total retirement account balances and an average 5.1% decline in
balances of their other savings accounts. Given the slight increase in average stock and bond values during
the period considered, this is consistent with an overall net withdrawal of funds from those accounts.

12

households instead increased their contributions to their retirement account and reported
net additions to their other savings account.

More insight into this issue is provided in Table 11, which shows changes in
allocations to retirement and other savings accounts for those unemployed at the end of
2009 and for those who experienced income losses over 10% during the past year.
Between 90% and 100% of individuals belonging to these groups report decreasing or
stopping their contributions or report prematurely withdrawing funds from their
retirement account. A much higher share of these groups than in the rest of the sample
also report to have used up funds from their other savings accounts.
Among reasons provided, many respondents mentioned job, salary and household
income changes as playing a role in their decisions to increase or decrease their net
contributions to their retirement and other savings accounts (Table 12). Perhaps not
surprisingly, among the reasons for increasing allocations, a desire to increase savings for
retirement was the most important factor, with “good time to invest” also often listed as
motivation. Precautionary savings motives were listed as significant factors as well, while
bequest motives and a desire to make up losses in home and stock values were less
frequently mentioned. Among those who decreased net contributions to their retirement
accounts or who used up funds from other savings accounts, a need or desire to pay for
general living expenses, pay bills and reduce debt were most frequently reported as
motivations.
In our survey we also asked respondents to rate the importance to their household
of a set of alternative reasons for savings in general. The findings, reported in Table 13,
show saving for retirement, precautionary savings motives and saving to pay for a child
or grandchild’s education as the reasons most frequently listed as “very important”.
Saving for retirement is more frequently mentioned by those in the middle and older age
groups and those with household incomes over $75,000. Precautionary savings motives
are generally more frequently mentioned by the 40-55 age groups and those with
household incomes under $30,000. Saving to pay for the education of children or grand
children or to buy a house or car is more frequently mentioned as an important reason for
saving by younger individuals.
Finally, in addition to measuring changes in net contributions, it is interesting to
analyze whether individuals made changes to how new funds or existing funds in their
retirement and savings accounts were allocated. As shown in Table 14, while
approximately equal proportions increased and decreased the amount of new allocations
used to buy stocks, a larger proportion of respondents rebalanced their stockholding by
reducing their exposure to stocks in the first two months immediately following the stock

13

market crash in October 2008, with about 3% pulling all funds out of the stock market.
Similarly, 18% of respondents in the end-of-2009 survey indicated that they moved some
of their retirement savings to less risky investments. This survey evidence suggests that a
non-negligible number of households appear to have shifted their allocations away from
stocks, implying that not all consumers may have fully benefited from the recent rebound
in the stock market.

b2. Recent Changes in Consumer Debt
Before discussing our survey-based evidence on changes in consumer debt, we
first describe recent findings based the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel, a unique and
comprehensive administrative database of credit report records for a large random sample
of US individuals and households. As shown in Chart 15, after reaching a peak at the end
of the third quarter of 2008, overall household debt has fallen steadily, declining by about
$567 billion (4.5%) up to the end of December 2009.
In order to relate the observed change in total consumer debt to the NIPA measure
of savings, we first distinguish between mortgage debt (on first mortgages, second
mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)) and non-mortgage debt (on credit
card loans, auto loans, student loans and other personal loans). Second, we exclude from
the observed quarter-to-quarter changes in overall mortgage debt all changes in debt
associated with home transactions. Third, in computing changes in mortgage and nonmortgage debt, we exclude amounts charged-off by banks. The resulting measure
describes how much individuals on average are paying down or adding to their debts. 21
The trends in net changes in mortgage and non-mortgage debt, shown in Chart 16,
reveal that until 2008 net pay-down on mortgage debt was actually negative: the
increases in debt associated with cash-out refinances, second mortgages and HELOCs
exceeded the total mortgage payments consumers were making to reduce mortgage
principals. Since then, consumers have accelerated paying down mortgage debt and, in
2009, mortgage debt was reduced by 140 billion dollars. Similarly, in 2009 consumers on
average started paying down their outstanding non-mortgage debt, even though by a
much smaller amount. Differentiating by loan type, we find that while consumers were
paying down auto loan debt, student loan debt instead has been growing rapidly.

21

For further explanation and details of this analysis see The financial Crisis at the Kitchen Table: Trends
in Household Debt and Credit (Brown, Haughwout, Lee and van der Klaauw, 2010, Federal Reserve Bank
of New York Staff Report, no. 480, December 2010).

14

The evidence from the NYFed survey shown in Table 15 is broadly consistent
with recent trends in the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel. A considerably larger
proportion of respondents report decreasing rather than increasing their mortgage debt,
with declines in mortgage debt reported most frequently among the 40-55 age and highincome groups. While most individuals who reduced mortgage debt reported doing so by
making their scheduled mortgage payments, about 17% mentioned doing so in part by
prepaying principal and 11% did so in part through a refinance. Prepaying and
refinancing were more frequently reported by higher-income individuals and college
graduates. These findings suggest that at least a substantial share of households who
reduced their outstanding mortgage debt did so voluntarily.
Interestingly, our survey results provide little evidence that households also
reduced non-mortgage debt during the past year. While overall a slightly larger share of
households reduced than increased such debt, on average debt increased by about $400
during the past year. Declines in non-mortgage debt were more likely to be reported by
older individuals and those with household incomes above $75,000. The latter group of
respondents actually reported reducing their non-mortgage debt on average by $2,000
during the past year. Overall this survey evidence is consistent with the findings
presented earlier in Chart 16 of households paying down mortgage debt, but with little if
any reductions in outstanding non-mortgage debt.
Not surprisingly, individuals who were unemployed at the end of 2009 were less
likely to report reductions in their mortgage debt and more likely to report increases
(Table 16). They were also more likely to report increases in their non-mortgage debt, but
a greater share of such individuals also reported decreases in non-mortgage debt. 22
Overall unemployed individuals reported adding to their non-mortgage debt by $2,300 on
average. Similarly, respondents from households which experienced an income drop of
more than 10% during the year, also were more likely to report increases in their
mortgage and non-mortgage debt.

b3. Responses in Spending and Savings to Hypothetical Income Shocks
To get an alternative view of household preferences and intentions for saving and
spending, we asked respondents about their intended responses to a positive shock in
their year-ahead income as well as a negative income shock, to account for a possible
asymmetry in intended response behavior. Responses to both questions are shown in
Table 17. Overall 99% of respondents say they would at least use part of the extra income
22

Unfortunately, we cannot evaluate with our data the extent to which the observed declines in mortgage
and non-mortgage debt of individuals were due to lenders tightening standards and reducing limits on
revolving credit lines during this period.

15

to save, invest or pay down debt, with 61% of all respondents saying that they would in
fact use all the extra income for saving and/or for paying down debt. Only 1% of
individuals say that they will spend or donate it all, with another 39% saying they would
spend only some of the extra income. Aggregated across all individuals, on average 41%
of the extra income would be used for saving/investing, 44% for debt payoff and only
15% for spending. Comparing across demographic groups, we find surprisingly little
differences in the expected shares of income to be used for consumption.
Faced with an unexpected income drop, respondents instead expect to respond
mainly by reducing their spending. Overall, 53% of respondents expect to reduce
spending by the full amount of the shortfall. Only 13% expect to take on some more debt
to cover the shortfall while 41% expect to use some of their savings to cover the lost
income. On average, individuals expect to cover about 74% of the income loss by cutting
spending, 20% by using some of their savings, and 6% by borrowing.
Care must be taken in interpreting stated intentions as actual future behavioral
responses to realized income surprises. However, the findings appear to suggest that
consumers will be unlikely to increase spending by much if their incomes were to
increase by more than expected, while on the other hand they seem likely to cut spending
quite drastically in response to an unexpected future income shortfall.

4. Households Expectations of Future Conditions and Behaviors
In this section we analyze what households are expecting for the future. In the
NYFed survey we asked a number of questions eliciting individuals’ expectations
regarding a variety of outcomes and decisions, including their household’s income,
spending, saving behavior and retirement plans.
We first discuss individuals’ expectations reported at the end of 2009 about
overall economic conditions during the following 12 months. As shown in Table 18,
more respondents expect to see increases than decreases in the unemployment, loan
interest and mortgage rate. However, a slightly higher share expect an increase rather
than a decrease in the average house price at the national level, but on average expecting
an increase of only 0.5% during 2010. Perhaps not surprisingly, expectations about
overall economic conditions vary with experiences of financial distress. As shown in
Table 19, those who are under water are more likely to expect higher unemployment,
interest and mortgage rates. Expectations for those who are unemployed or those who
reported household income losses of over 10% during 2009 do not depict the same
pessimistic picture. In fact, expectations for this group tend to be more optimistic relative

16

to our sample. It is also notable that those who report to be underwater are more likely to
expect home prices to rise in the future, and to expect a higher mean increase in home
prices relative to the entire sample.
Tables 20 and 21 report expectations about a number of personal outcomes and
decisions. Considering first year-ahead expectations of household incomes, while there
exists considerable heterogeneity in expectations across individuals, overall respondents
are reasonably optimistic, expecting an average increase of 4.1% in their household
income over the next 12 months. Expected increases are higher on average among
younger and lower-income respondents, while older and higher-income respondents
instead on average expect a small decline in their household incomes. 23 Expected
increases are highest on average for financially distressed respondents, i.e., those who
report to be unemployed at the end of 2009 and those who report to have lost over 10% of
household income in 2009 (Table 21). This is consistent with them anticipating finding a
job or experiencing an income rebound in the next 12 months. A similar pattern is found
for wage expectations (asked of those who were employed at the time of the survey at the
end of 2009), with workers expecting an average 3.4% increase in their wages.
When asked whether they expect to make any changes to their retirement
contributions over the next year, 13% report that they expect to increase their
contributions, 4% expect to decrease contributions and the remainder expect to keep them
unchanged. Older individuals, those with low incomes and those currently under water
are less likely to expect to increase their retirement account allocations. About 29%
expect to add more or to use up less of their other savings accounts during the next year,
while 24% instead expect to add less or use up more of their other savings. Overall older
and lower-income households plan to add less or use more of their other savings than
their younger and more affluent counterparts.
While over 80% of homeowners with a mortgage expect to pay down some of the
principal on their mortgage loans, some 24% expect to pre-pay some of the principal.
Low income individuals and those unemployed at the end of 2009 are least likely to
expect to pay down some of the principle (64%) and least likely to expect to pre-pay
some of the principal (15%). On the other hand, 6% of homeowners with mortgages
expect to miss payments during the next year, with the rate being as much as 22% for
those with incomes under $30,000 and 30% for those unemployed. Interestingly, the
share of households expecting to miss a mortgage payment during the next year is
actually smaller (1%) in the bubble states than in the nation as a whole. Finally, another

23

Clearly some of these responses reflect expectations of non-labor income, life cycle behavior (expected
retirement) and rebounds in income by the unemployed expecting to find work.

17

6% of homeowners with mortgages are expecting to add an additional mortgage or a
home equity line of credit.
Considering non-mortgage debt we find that 66% of respondents expect to
decrease their combined debt on credit cards, auto loans and student loans and only 4%
expect to increase it. Plans to reduce such debt are slightly more prevalent among
younger individuals and higher-income individuals, and are the highest amongst
individuals who report to be under water on their mortgage.
A greater share of households expect to increase their monthly spending over the
next 12 months than to decrease it. On average household spending is expected to
increase by 1.7%. Given an average expected increase in pre-tax household income of
4.1%, and assuming a similar increase in disposable income, this implies an average
expected increase of 2.4% in saving or debt reduction. Closely tracking their expectations
of household income increases, younger individuals, those with incomes under $30,000
and those who are under water expect the greatest increases in spending over the next 12
months.
We also elicited expectations about future retirement, bequests and personal yearahead overall financial situation. As shown in Tables 22 and 23, 24% reported that they
had postponed retirement, while 5% now plan to retire earlier. Plans to postpone
retirement were most prevalent among workers over 55 and workers with higher
household incomes. Perhaps not surprisingly given the loss of wealth experienced during
the recession, more respondents report that the chance that they will leave an inheritance
has fallen instead of increased during the past year, with declined chances more likely to
be reported by for those who are financially distressed.
Asked whether over the next 12 months they expect that it generally will become
easier, harder or equally difficult to obtain credit or loans compared to the past 12
months, about twice as many respondents expect credit conditions to worsen: 39% expect
credit to become more difficult to obtain (with the rate being as high as 59% for those
under water), while 20% expect it to become easier.
Finally, significantly more respondents expect to be financially better off than
worse off 12 months from now. Comparing across age and income groups, we find that
younger individuals are far more optimistic than older individuals, but find little
differences across income groups. Individuals who are most financially distressed report
the most optimistic expectations.

18

5. Conclusion

In this paper we first documented the extent to which households were affected by
the declines in the housing, stock and labor markets as well as the heterogeneity in the
impact of these declines across age, income, education groups and geographic areas.
Next, we analyzed the nature of behavioral responses to the shocks in income and wealth,
including changes in spending, contributions to retirement and savings accounts, and
changes in household mortgage and non-mortgage debt. Finally, we assessed people’s
expectations about a large set of behaviors and outcomes going forward, including their
expectations about the labor and housing markets, access to credit, their future spending
and saving behavior, and expectations for paying down debts.
We found large differences across households in the extent to which they were
affected by the recession, especially by income, age and geography. While considerable
proportions of households were not directly affected by declines in the housing, stock and
labor markets, a large share of households were affected by at least one of these. The
proportion of households that suffered large declines in housing wealth and in retirement
savings, and which experienced large income drops varied across demographic groups,
but the proportion that experienced at least one of these was fairly evenly spread across
groups.
In response to their deteriorated financial situation, households reduced their
average spending. At the same time, they increased their saving, with the personal saving
rate as measured by the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) increasing
considerably from historically low pre-recession levels. Survey data suggest that if there
indeed was a recent increase in household saving, this increase – at least in 2009 – did not
materialize itself through an increase in contributions to retirement and savings accounts.
If anything, such contributions actually declined on average during the past year. Instead,
the higher saving rate appears to reflect a considerable decline in household debt,
mortgage debt in particular. This suggests that rebuilding net wealth was an important
driver of household decisions. Unlike the period leading up to the current recession,
during which the average mortgage debt pay-down rate was negative (increases in debt
associated with second mortgages, cash-out refinances and home equity lines of credit,
exceeded regular principal pay-downs on existing mortgages), since 2008 it has turned
positive. Similarly, the steady annual increase in outstanding non-mortgage debt (also
referred to as consumer debt) came to a halt in 2009. However, unlike mortgage debt,
consumers made little headway in 2009 in actually lowering total non-mortgage debt,
with some debt such as that associated with student loans continuing to grow steadily.

19

Regarding individuals’ expectations about the future, we find that individuals
across all demographic groups had moderately optimistic expectations about income and
earnings in 2010. At the end of 2009 consumers expected to increase spending in 2010 by
less than perceived increases in earnings and income, and expected to pay down debt and
increase savings, suggesting a shift in attitudes regarding saving and consumption. The
implied moderate increase in saving during 2010 is in fact consistent with what we have
observed so far in 2010. While consumers were moderately optimistic about their income
prospects, they were pessimistic about the availability of credit, with access to credit
expected to become even more difficult during 2010.

20

Appendix
The RAND American Life Panel
The survey data used in this paper were collected through two survey modules
administered over the internet to participants in RAND’s American Life Panel (ALP).
The ALP is an Internet panel of respondents 18 and over. Respondents in the panel either
use their own computer to log on to the Internet or they were provided a small laptop or a
Web TV, which allows them to access the Internet, using their television and a telephone
line. The technology allows respondents who did not have previous Internet access or a
computer to participate in the panel and furthermore use the Web TVs for browsing the
Internet or use email.
The first survey module we analyze, referred to in the paper as the RAND survey,
was designed by Michael Hurd and Susann Rohwedder to evaluate the effects of the
financial crisis. The survey was fielded from November 2008 to February 2009, with the
vast majority of respondents completing the survey in November 2008. The NYFed
survey on saving behavior was fielded between the end of October 2009 and January
2010, with the vast majority again responding in November 2009. Respondents were
paid an incentive of about $20 per thirty minutes of interviewing. Although respondents
were allowed to skip questions, those who tried to do so received a prompt encouraging
them to provide an answer.
Most of the participants in both ALP surveys were randomly selected among
participants in the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers at the University
of Michigan's Survey Research Center. An additional group of respondents were
recruited through a snowball sample, through referrals of friends and acquaintances.
While all ALP members were invited to participate in the RAND survey on the effects of
the financial crisis, the NYFed survey on saving behavior was restricted to a subset of
newer ALP members - those who participated in the Michigan Survey after December
2006.
A total of 900 ALP participants completed the NYFed survey, while 2057
members completed the RAND survey. Respondents in the NYFed survey reported an
average age of 50.5, with a median of 51. In total, 58% were female, 66% were married
or living with a partner, 52% had at least a Bachelor’s degree, 81% owned a home and
89% were white. 21% lived in one of the five states that experienced the greatest housing
bubble and/or bust, which were Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan and Nevada. The
median reported income range was $60,000-$75,000, with 43% of the respondents
reporting incomes over $75,000.
Respondents in the RAND survey reported an average age of 50.0, with a median
of 51. In total, 57% were female, 65% were married or living with a partner, 45% had at
least a bachelor’s degree, 78% owned a home and 90% were white. 22% lived in one of
the five bubble/bust states. The median reported income range was $60,000-$75,000,
with 37% of the respondents reporting incomes over $75,000. For a more detailed

21

description of the sample see Hurd and Rohwedder’s Effects of the Financial Crisis and
Great Recession on American Households (NBER working paper 16407, 2010).
In all the analyses reported in this paper, sample weights were applied to make the
two samples representative of the U.S. population. The weights were computed to equate
sample proportions to those in the 2009 Current Population Survey, for all population
subgroups defined by homeownership, living in a ‘bubble state’, income under $30,000,
age under 40, and having a college degree.
The FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel
Some of the analyses in this study are based on credit report data from the
FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel. The panel comprises a nationally representative 5%
random sample of US individuals with credit files, and all of the household members of
those 5%. In all, the data set includes files on more than 15% of the adult population
(aged 18 or older), or approximately 37 million individuals in each quarter from 1999 to
the present. The underlying sampling approach ensures that the panel is dynamically
updated in each quarter to reflect new entries into and exits out of the credit markets, with
young individuals and immigrants entering the sample and deceased individuals and
emigrants leaving the sample at the same rate as in the population of individuals with
credit files. In each quarter, the records of all other household members who shared a
primary individual’s mailing address were also included. Even though all individuals
included in the database are anonymous, the panel allows one to track individuals and
households consistently over time. In addition to the computation of nationally
representative estimates of individual and household level debt and credit in each quarter,
the panel therefore permits a rich analysis of the dynamics of consumer debt and related
policy issues at both the individual and household levels.
Since the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel data are collected at the borrower level,
they offer a more comprehensive perspective on mortgage debt than is available in
standard loan-level datasets. In addition to detailed data on all debts secured by
residential real estate, the panel includes information on individuals’ and households’
other loans, such as credit cards, auto loans and student loans. More general information
available in the panel include the residential location of the borrower at the census block
level, the individual’s year of birth, the individual’s credit experience such as foreclosure,
bankruptcy and collection, as well as a consumer credit score that is comparable to the
well known FICO score. More details regarding the sample design and data content can
be found in Lee and van der Klaauw (2010). 24

Source: NYFed survey. + among home owners *: among mortgage debt holders
Home ownership based on question: Do you [(or your spouse/partner)] own a home? For the purposes of
this survey a home is defined as a house, condo, apartment, mobile home, etc. (with or without a
mortgage).
‘Under water’ is based on following question: If you sold your home today, would the proceeds be

*: among stock holders
**: proportion who answered yes to the question “Have the recent financial problems in the economy
reduced the value of [your (and your spouse's partner's)] retirement savings?”

+: based on percentage and absolute amount responses to the question “Thinking of [your (and your
[spouse's/partner's])] retirement savings (not including Social Security) how much have they lost in value
as a result of the problems in the economy since October 1st, 2008?”
RAND survey data based on following questions:
In the next set of questions we will ask you about stock holdings [including those held by you and your
spouse/partner jointly, by you only, or by your and your spouse/partner only]. Do [you (or your
husband/wife/partner)] have any shares of stock or stock mutual funds? Please include stocks that [you
(or your husband/wife/partner)] hold in an employer pension account.
Thinking back to the time immediately before October 1st, 2008, that is, before the large drop in the stock
markets, what were [your (and your spouse's/partner's)] stock holdings worth immediately before then?
Please include the value of stocks that you hold directly and the value of stocks that [your (and your
spouse's/partner's)] hold in an employer pension account.
And what are [your (and your spouse's/partner's)] stock holdings worth now?
NYFed survey data based on following questions:
Please indicate whether you [(or your spouse/partner)] currently are or ever have been enrolled in each of
the following types of pension plans:
A Defined Benefit Plan, also known as a traditional employer-provided Pension Plan, which pays a fixed
amount when you retire, where the amount typically depends on your final or average salary.
A Defined Contribution Plan (such as a 401K, individual retirement account (IRA), tax deferred annuity
or 403(b), 457 thrift savings plan) in which workers and/or their employers make contributions to an
account in which money accumulates, and that money can be paid out in a variety of ways depending on
the plan or worker's choice.

Based on following questions: from RAND survey: Over the past months there have been reports about
the nation's financial problems including large drops in the stock market and in the housing market and
increased rates of foreclosures and joblessness. As this financial crisis unfolds more and more people
have been affected in different ways. Have you (or your husband/wife/partner) been affected by these
problems?
We are interested in how people are getting along financially these days. Would you say that you [(and
your household)] are better off or worse off financially than you were a year ago?

The proportion of respondents with retirement savings losses over 30% is based on answers in the RAND
survey to the question “Thinking of [your (and your [spouse's/partner's])] retirement savings (not
including Social Security) how much have they lost in value as a result of the problems in the economy
since October 1st, 2008?” In the RAND survey, the proportion under water is calculated based on the
perceived current value of a house and the total amount owed on the house. In the NYFed survey the
proportion under water represents households with a mortgage who answered no to the question “If you
sold your home today, would the proceeds be sufficient to pay off all mortgage loans and any costs of
completing the sale?”. In NYFed survey, the proportion with over 10% income drop represents the
proportion of respondents who reported drops of over 10% in the total combined income of all members
of your household during the last 12 months.

Based on questions: During the past 12 months have you: (indicate Y/N for each) … (1) Started putting
less of your money in 401(k), IRA or other retirement accounts?, (2) Started putting more of your money
in 401(k), IRA or other retirement accounts?, (3) Stopped putting money in a 401(k), IRA or other
retirement accounts?, (4) Started saving (for the first time) in a 401(k), IRA or other retirement account?,
(5) Prematurely withdrawn money from your retirement savings?
You indicated that you started putting more[less] of your money into your retirement account(s). By how
much did you [(and your spouse/partner)] increase[decrease] your total monthly contribution to your
retirement account(s)?
Our next question asks about other savings and investments you may have, excluding those in a
retirement account. We first want to know whether you made any contributions and/or withdrawals to
your savings and investments over the past year. Please do not consider changes in the market value of
the funds in these accounts, only consider the amounts of new money you added and the amounts you
took out.
For each of the following would you say that over the past 12 months you [(and your spouse/partner)]
have withdrawn more from your investments or savings than you have added to them in new money, that
you have added more to savings and investments than you withdrew, or neither? [checking accounts,
saving accounts, money market accounts, stocks]
Considering all accounts together, would you say that during the past 12 months you [(and your
spouse/partner)] have used up more of your investments or savings than you have added to them in new
money, that you have added more to savings and investments than you used up, or neither? Answer
options: (1) Have used up more than added, (2) Have added more than used up, (3)Added about the same
as used up.
During the past 12 months, about how much more did you [(and your spouse/partner)] use up or withdraw
from your investments or savings than you added to it? During the past 12 months, about how much more
did you [(and your spouse/partner)] add to your investments or savings than you used or withdrew from
it?

Based on following questions:
During the past 12 months has the total amount you [(and your spouse/partner)] owe on these mortgages
increased, decreased or stayed the same?
If decreased or increased: What was the reason for this change in your overall mortgage balance? (Check
all that apply) … (1) Paid down some of the principal on the regular schedule, (2) Pre-paid (ahead of
schedule) some of the principal, (3) Refinanced, (4) Missed, or made late or incomplete payments and
fees were added to the mortgage balance, (5) Added an additional mortgage or borrowed on a home

mortgage debt. During the past 12 months has the total outstanding balance (that is the total amount you
owe) of these loans combined increased, decreased or stayed the same? By how much has the overall
combined balance on these debts increased/decreased during the past 12 months?

Based on following questions:
How about people out of work during the coming 12 months -- do you think that there will be more
unemployment than now, about the same, or less?
No one can say for sure, but what do you think will happen to interest rates for borrowing money during
the next 12 months -- will they go up, stay the same, or go down?
A year from now, do you think interest rates on home mortgages will be higher, lower or about the same
as they are now?
One year from now, do you think that the average house price at the national level will be higher, lower or
about the same as today?
In percentage terms, how much higher/lower on average do you expect the average house price to be at
the national level a year from now?

place you currently work, and working the exact same number of hours. Twelve months from now, do
you expect your earnings on this job, before taxes and deductions, to have gone up, or gone down, or
stayed where they are now? By about what percent do you expect that your earnings on this job, before
taxes and other deductions, will have gone up[down], 12 months from now, in that case?
Thinking now about the coming year, do you [(and your spouse/partner)] expect to make any changes to
your contributions to your retirement account(s) during the next 12 months? Answer options: (1) Yes,
expect to increase total contribution, (2) Yes, expect to decrease total contribution, (3) No, expect to keep
total contribution the same.
Thinking now about the coming year, do you [(and your spouse/partner)] expect to use up more, less or
about the same amount of your savings and investments during the next 12 months than you did in the last
year? OR Thinking now about the coming year, do you [(and your spouse/partner)] expect to add more,
less or about the same amount of new money to your savings and investments during the next 12 months
than you did in the last year?
Thinking now about the coming year, do you [(and your spouse/partner)] ... (Check all that apply) (1)
Expect to pay down some of the principal on the regular schedule, (2) Expect to pre-pay (ahead of
schedule) some of the principal, (3) Expect to miss payments, (4) Expect to add an additional mortgage or
borrow on a home equity line of credit, or (5) other [Please specify].
Thinking ahead, one year from now: How do you expect your monthly spending one year in the future to
compare to your monthly spending today? In percentage terms, by how much do you expect your average
monthly spending to increase [decrease]?

*: among those currently working
**: among those with age 60 or younger
Based on following questions: Thinking about work in general and not just your present job (if you
currently work), what do you think is the percent chance that you will be working full-time after you
reach age 62 [65]? Has the age at which you plan to retire changed since last year? [Answer options: (1) I
now plan to retire sooner than I did last year, (2) no change in plans, (3) I now plan to retire later than I
did last year.] In the past 12 months, have the chances of you [(and your spouse/partner)] leaving an
inheritance increased, decreased or stayed the same? During the next 12 months, do you expect that it
generally will become easier, harder or equally difficult to obtain credit or loans compared to the past 12
months? Now looking ahead - do you think that a year from now you [(and your household)] will be
better off financially, or worse off, or just about the same as now?
