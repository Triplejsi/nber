Marriage Patterns in the
United States

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes cohort marriage patterns in the United States in
order to determine whether declining rates of first marriage are due to
changes in the timing of marriage, the incidence of marriage, or both.
Parametric models, which are well—suited to the analysis of censored or truncated data, are fit separately to information on age at first marriage derived
from three data sets which were collected independently and at different points
in time.

Extended versions of the models are also estimated in which the param-

eters of the model distributions are allowed to depend on social and, economic
variables.

The results provide evidence that the incidence of first marriage is

declining and that there is only a slight tendency for women to delay marriage.
In addition, education is the most important correlate of decisions about the
timing of first marriage whereas race is the most important correlate of decisions about its incidence.

Introduction

Since the late 1960s, the rate of first marriages experienced by
individuals aged fourteen and over has declined substantially in the United
States (see Figure I).

This pattern, which has been characteristic ot both

men and women and has been quite steady over time, has contributed to the

increasing proportion of single young adults in the population. According to
some researchers, these facts reflect changes in the timing of marriage, and
not changes in its ultimate incidence.

For example, according to Cherlin

(1981, p. ii), "The higher proportion ot single young adults in the 1970s and

early 1930s suggests only that they are marrying later, not foregoing
marriage.

It is unlikely that their litetime proportions marrying will tall

below the historical minimum bf QO percent."

Indeed, as Figure II shows, the

median age at first marriage increased by more than one year tor both males and
temales during the 1970s.

On the other hand, other researchers such as Becker (1981) present
theoretical nx1e1s which suggest that the recent trends are primarily reflective ot changes in the incidence ot marriage since the rising economic status
ot women leaves them with less incentive to enter traditional marriages.
These researchers are also quick to point out that a secular increase in the

median age at first nnrriage is consistent with a decline in the proportion of
individuals who ever marry, and not only with the phenomenon ot delayed
marriage.

Implicit in both ot these views are projections ot the tuture time
series ot marriage rates.

For example, it marriage rates have declined mainly

because of an increasing tendency to delay marriage, the rates should soon

—3--

begin to rise as the delayers reach their desired ages of first marriage.

Alternatively, if the decline is mostly the result of an increasing proportion
of women deciding to (or, by default, just happening to) forego marriage, then
marriage rates will tend to remain depressed in the future.
The purpose of this paper is to analyze recent nuptiality patterns
in the United States in an attempt to distinguish between these alternative

vieis

of recent marriage trends. We

do this by using a parametric model to

analyze survey data on age at first marriage for successive birth cohorts.

Because the model is parametric, it allows us to project marriage rates for
cohorts which have yet to complete their first marriage experience and to
thereby estimate their mean age at marriage and the proportion ultimately
marrying.

We also estimate an extended version of this model in which the

parameters are allowed to depend on social and economic variables such as race
and education.

In this way, we investigate the correlates of the timing and

incidence of marriage for a succession of birth cohorts.

Section II provides a brief description of the parametric model we
use to represent the underlying pattern of age at first marriage; this section
also discusses both the extension of the rrridel to incorporate covariate effects

and maximum likelihood estimation from truncated and non—truncated data sets.
Section III describes the three data sets used in this study. Section IV presents and discusses the results of fitting various specifications of the model
to cohort data in each of these data sets; this section also examines the sensitivity of our results to the degree of censoring.

Section V discusses our

results and comments on their implications for the evolution of nuptiality patterns in the United States.1

The Model
In 1971, Ansley Coale observed that age distributions of first

marriages are structurally similar in difterent populations.

As shown by Coale,

these distributions tend to be smooth, unimodal, skewed to the right, and have

density close to zero below age fifteen and above age fifty. Coale also
observed that the differences in age—at—irarriage distributions across female

populations are largely accounted tor by difterences in their means, their
standard

deviations, and their cunnxlativ-e values at the older ages, e.g., age

As a basis for the application of these observations, Coale

constructed a standard schedule of age at first nnrriage using data from
Sweden,

1865—69.

Coale and McNeil

(1972)

subsequently developed a closed—form

expression which closely replicates the reference distribution presented by
Coale

(1971)

g(x)

O.196exp{—.171i(x—6.o6)_exp_2.B81(x_6.o5)]}

This tunction can be related to any observed distribution by adjusting its

location and dispersion, and its cumulative value as x +

. The

particular

form of the rde1 that we shall use, which characterizes any observed distribution,

was derived by Rodriguez and Trussell (1980)

It

is interesting to note that Coale and McNeilTs model distribution

of first marriage by age (e.g., equation (1)) arises as the convolution of an
infinite number of mean—corrected exponential distributions whose parameters
increase

in arithmetic sequence. Moveover, Coale and McNeil have shown that

this distribution is very closely approximated by the convolution of the three
exponential distributions with the largest exponents (in the infinite sequence)
and a normal distribution.

This latter property of the Coale—MeWeil model

gives rise to an appealing behavioral interpretation of the model. According
to

this interpretation, each of the three exponential distributions charac-

terizes the waiting time between two premarital stages (i.e., between the commencement of dating and ultimately meeting one's spouse, between meeting the
spouse and engagement, and between engagement and marriage); the norm.1
distribution describes the age of entry of women into the marriage market.

This interpretation received some empirical support in the original paper by

Coale and McNeil in a direct test using data on the length of time that a
sample of French husbands and wives knew each other before marrying.
Subsequent

research,

however, has done little to confirm or

vioral interpretation of the model.

Nevertheless,

a number of studies have

provided additional support for the ability of the model to fit first marriage
data

(see, e.g., Ew1ank,

1974;

and Trussell, 1980; Trussell, 1980;

and Trussell and Bloom, 1983) . To some extent, the good fit my be due to the

to

fit distributions that are smooth,

It is also likely that the Coale—MeNeil

model performs well because it is based on the marriage rates for an actual
population.

In other words, even though the true model generating a given

—6—

distribution of marriage rates is unknown, the Coale—Metleil model may fit well
(and better than a purely theoretical model such as that due to Hernes (1972)

or purely ad hoc empirical TrxDdel such as that due to Keeley (1979)) because
the true model is captured implicitly in the rates on which it (i.e., the
Coale—MeMeil model) is based.2
The parameters of equation (2) may be estimated in a variety of ways
depending on the nature of the available data (see Rodriguez and Trussell
(1980)

In

for further details) .

the present application we shall work with

survey data on age at first marriage for individual women and will use a maximum

likelihood estimator. Thus, for a sample of all—women (i.e., a random sample
of ever—married and never—married women in some population or cohort), we will
estimate ji,

a,

and E by maximizing the following log likelihood function:

log LA =

1og

g(a'

i.i,a,E) +

where a1 is age at first nnrriage for those individuals who have married (the set
N),

is age at the time of survey for never—married individuals (the set

and GN) is the cumulative distribution function for the density function g(')
expressed in equation

(2) .

Observe

that the second summation on the right

hand side of equation (3) accounts for censoring which will be present to the
extent that not all women who ultimately do marry will have done so by the
time of the survey.

Alternatively, for a sample or ever—married women we employ a conditional likelihood function which is constructed from the likelihoods of
individualsT

usrrying at particular ages (a) conditional on their having

married by their age on the date of the interview:

—7—

log M =

[log g(a') -

Pd

log G(a)I.

Observe that this function does not depend on the parameter E, because E is a

proportionality factor in both g() and G() and therefore cancels when the

conditional likelihood (i.e., g(a)/G(4)) is expressed. This formulation
therefore corrects for the truncation of never—married women, although the
parameter E is not estimable from the truncated data.

Following Trussell and Bloom (1983),we extend this model to allow
for •coyariate effects by specifying a functional relationship between the

parameters of the model distribution and a set of covariates. For example, we
may specify these relationships in linear form as follows:

and

a, , and y, are the associated parameter vectors to be estimated. Because of
the modelTs inherent nonlinearity, the parameters are identified even if all of
the covariate vectors are the same.

(t—tests

pp. 5-P).

The Data

As noted in Section I, this study uses three independent data sets

to investigate the narriage patterns of American women. The use of multiple
data sets is prompted by the fact that no single data set is uniquely well—
suited to the tasks at hand.

In addition, we teel that the consistency ot

results derived from difterent sources ot intormation, collected at difterent
points in time, is an important indication ot their strength.

The remainder

ot this section provides descriptions ot the three data sets.

A. National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle II
Cycle II of the NSFG was conducted in 1976 by the National Center

for Health Statistics through personal interviews with 8,611 women aged 15b1
years.

For the purposes ot this study, the NSFG is usetul because it provides

data on a representative sample ot ever—married women with intormation on age at

first narriage along with several socioeconomic variables which presumably
influence age at marriage.
them are:

These variables and the coding scheme adopted tor

race (black or non—black), religion

childhood residence

(rural

(Catholic or non—Catholic),

or urban), and education at time ot survey (less

than high school, high school, greater than high school) .

All

women aged

2O_1i. at the time of the survey who first married between ages 12 and 1 are
included in our data file.

Because we do not have information on a represen-

tative sample of never—married women, we cannot estimate the parameter E

(i.e., the proportion ever—marrying) tram this sample; nor can we estimate
its

covariates.

However,

parameters i and 0

and

as discussed above, consistent estimates at the
their covariates can still be computed provided this

sample selection rule is explicitly incorporated in the estimation procedure
(which we do when we analyze the NSFG data) .

Observations

were counted more

or less heavily depending on their sample weights, with the weights adjusted
to have mean unity.

B. Current Population Survey (cPs)
The CPS is a nationwide sample survey conducted nDnthly by the
Bureau at the Census.

It involves detailed personal interviews in about

70,000 households during which intarmatian an a variety at demographic,
social, and economic variables is recorded.

The unit at observation is the

individual; the sample universe consists at all persons living in the surveyed
households.

In the June, 1982 CPS, the normal set of questions was supplemented
with a. set of retrospective rinrital history questions.

Included an the

supplementary survey instrument was a question on age at first narriage which
was asked of all women 'aged 13—75. Untartunately, there are tew retrospective covariates in the CPS that could sensibly be hypothesized to affect age
at marriage.

However, we have constructed the tallawing two variables:

race

(black, non—black) and education at time at survey (less than high school,

high school, greater than high school).

Although the CPS data set permits estimation of only two covariate
ettects, it is extremely useful in this study because (a) it refers to all

-10—

women, (b) it includes an exceptionally large number of observations, and (a)
it is very recent.

As with the NSFG, sample weights were used in creating

this data tile after adjusting them so they average to one.

C. National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Young Women
This survey has been conducted annually since 1968 when it started
with 5,159 women aged 14-24.

The main purpose of this survey has been to

gather longitudinal intormation on a wide range ot socioeconomic variables
for use in analyzing the labor market experiences of young women.

In 1978, a

complete reinterview ot the original sample ot women was conducted which
included a question on age at first marriage.

We have used this intormation,

along with information on number of rinrriages and marital status from each prior

wave ot this survey (tor ever—married women who tailed to report their age at

first marriage in 1978), to construct a data set on age at first marriage for
women aged 2b—35 in 197'8.
In comparison to the NSFG and CPS data, the NES data are more usetul
because they contain intormation on two socioeconomic variables relevant to a
study ot age at first marriage that are not available in the 'other two data
sets.

This intormation reters to the occupation ot the respondent's tather

(i.e., blue collar or not) and to the structure ot the respondent's tamily when
she was age 14 (i.e., both parents present or not) .

includes information on race

In addition, the NLS

(black or non—black), childhood residence (rural

or urban), and education at time ot survey (less than high school; equal to

high school; greater than high school). The IlLS does, however, have several
weaknesses in that it does not include information about religion, it has a

—11—

smaller sample size than the CPS, and it refers to a narrower group of ages

than either the NSFG or the CPS. The NLS data ray also be a nonrepresentative
sample of the population because of sample attrition, although the 1918 file
includes infornation on 79 percent of the original NLS participants.

Results

A. Estimates Computed Without Covariates

We first fit the Coale—McNeil model without covariates to data from
the NSFG, CPS, and NLS in order to ascertain the general trends in marriage
patterns

across cohorts.

The fact that we do not include covariates in the

estimation procedure implies that we treat the parameters U, J, and E as

constants, i.e., U, a, and E are not allowed to depend on individual characteristics.

These preliminary results derived from the three data sets are presented in Table I.

time,
In comparing the results from the NSFG and the CPS we see a
remarkable consistency in the estimates of p and a,

Estimates of U are very

similar across data sets and are essentially constant across cohorts.

Estimates of p are virtually identical between data sets for the younger
cohorts and diverge slightly tor the older cohorts.

This divergence may be

accounted for in part by sampling variability since the estimated standard error
of p for the L6—50 year aids in the CPS is .01 and for the 1O—1t1t years olds in

the NSFG, .11).

Another prominent feature of Table I are the estimates of E derived
from the CPS data.

The parameter E cannot, ot course, be estimated from the

NSFG because the sample consists only of ever—married women. From the CPS
results,

however, we can clearly see a monotonic, downward trend across

cohorts in the proportion ot women who will ultimately marry.

it appears that

only 1 percent of those who were in their late GO's in 1982 will never marry,

whereas as many as 13 percent of those in their late 20's will remain
unmarried.

The estimates of E also decline across the two ¶3 cohorts.

Moreover, they are extremely close to the CPS estimates for roughly the same
cohorts.

It should be emphasized that the strong agreement among the
results derived from the three data sets—points toward the overall robustness
ot the estimates.

The fact that different data were used, obtained at dif—

terent points in time, and that estimates were derived using somewhat dit—

ferent nrdels (i.e., with regard to the difterent likelihood tunctions

—13—

employed in order to account for the differing nature of the two samples ——
one

of all women and one of only ever—married women) adds to our overall con-

fidence in the parameter estimates. Of course, it is possible that the model
fits the data poorly, hut in roughly the same way across data sets. To examine this possibility, we have calculated observed marriage rates by age for
the four oldest cohorts in the CPS data and have plotted these in Figure III

in relation to the estimated models. Although the ttdels tend to underpredict
the proportion of marriages occurring at the modal age at marriage, they do
correspond to the data quite closely, and especially in the tails ot the
distributions.

Thus, it appears that equation (2) does indeed provide a

satistactory fit to the data.

B. Estimates Computed with Covariates

Thus, race has been of increasing impor-

tance in differentiating those who will rarry from those who will not.

Results derived from the 1QIB NLS, as shown in Table IV, while
somewhat difficult to compare with the results in Tables II and III, reveal patterns of nuptiality that are similar to those revealed by estimates computed
from the other data sets.

Education is positively associated with the age at

which a woman marries and negatively associated with her propensity to marry.
Here, too, we see that being black is associated with a substantially reduced
probabilty of ever—marrying, yet has a trivial association with the age at which
one marries (conditioned upon marrying).6

variables which measure parental background (e.g., the blue collar

white collar variable) are minor factors in the determination of age at

marriage.

Moreover, the fact that the marriage of a woman's parents dissolved

sometime prior to her adolescence has only a small negative association with the
age at which she marries.

We might speculate that, under the (debatable)

assumption that young women with single parents find their home lite less

pleasant than it would he otherwise, these women are motivated to leave home
earlier than their counterparts who have parents with intact marriages.
Traditionally,

marriage has been one mechanism by which a woman can leave home

at an early age, although marriage is increasingly less necessary in recent
years tor her to do so.

C.

Sensitivity

Analysis

Since many of the parameter estimates reported in Tables II—IV are
computed from data that are either truncated, censored, or both, their reliability is heavily dependent on the statistical structure which we have imposed on
the data.

To some extent, the underlying structure is supported by the reaso-

nably close fits of the model to the data as shown in Figure III. The closeness
of the parameter and hyperparameter estimates derived from different riatasets
collected at difterent points in time provides turther support tor the model.

However, one additional test ot the adequacy ot the model seems appropriate and
has been conducted.

This test essentially involves censoring intormation on

first marriages that took place in the last ten years ot the data and fitting

the model to the artificially censored data to see how well the estimates
predict

actual experience.

We have carried out this experiment using the CPS data. Estimates
were computed for cohorts aged

41—45, and 6—o in 1982, using data on

their first narriage experience as of 1972. These estimates are reported in
Table V for what we found to be the strictest form of this test of the model:

estimates of the extended version of equation (2) which allow for covariate
eftects.

The estimates in Table V may be compared to those presented in the
last three columns ot Table III.

In general, the estimates computed tor indivi-

dual cohorts as ot 1972 tend to be quite close to those computed using ten years
ot additional marriage experience.

Indeed, the estimates ot the covariate

effects on p and their standard errors are extremely close and would support
identical

substantive

conclusions.

The estimates of a and of the covariate

eftects on E are a bit tarther apart, although not seriously so given the small
absolute magnitudes ot what appear to be statistically significant difterences.

Thus, on balance, we believe the results of this test provide further support for
the ability of the nDdel to fit censored data.

V. Discussion and Conclusion
Changes in the marriage process can be decomposed into two distinguishable
overall

phenomena:
incidence.

changes in the timing ot marriage and changes in its

Period or cross—sectional data relating to these phenomena—

whether first marriage rates, the proportion ever—married in a particular age
group, or the mean age at marriage, tor example——are often misleading in their
implications.

It would be desirable to interpret the various changes we find in

—17-

marriage statistics as reflective ot changes in lite cycle patterns at women.
In a period of potentially unstable nuptiality patterns, the only valid
interpretations are those interred from cohort—based data.

In this analy-

sis we have examined nuptiality patterns of cohorts of American women using data

from the 1976 NSFG, the 1982 CPS, and the 1978 NLS. Implementing a parametric
model, 'we can project the currently incomplete marriage experience of cohorts.

In this fashion, we can estimate the mean age at marriage and the proportion
ever—marrying in young cohorts today.

Thus, we can resolve in good part some of

the arguments in the literature concerning the current and future trends in the
timing and incidence at tirst marriages in the United States.

We have found that age at first marriage has been quite stable across
birth cohorts spanning twenty years.

The proportion of women ultimately never—

for those 46 to 50 in that year.

Several additional major tindings emerge in our analysis when we tit
an extended version at the nuptiality model to the three data sets.

Educational

attainment has a strong positive association with the age at which women marry,
given that they nnrry. Further,

higher education is increasingly negatively

associated with the probability at ever—marrying among recent cohorts.

In addi-

tion, race was found to be a large and increasingly important correlate of a
woman's propensity to marry.

Far example, only 66 percent at black women aged

26 to 30 in 1982 who had not graduated high school can be expected to marry, as
compared with 91 percent at their white counterparts.

marriage patterns of American women, as appropriate data for American men are
ot insufticient quality (see,

With the exception ot education, all ot the covariates used in

defined as years ot schooling at the time ot the survey and not at the time ot

the first marriage because we believe that the former measure is a (marginally)
superior social indicator and because it can be constructed for all three data
sets.

In

addition, in experiments conducted using the NLS data, we discovered

that parameter estimates differed trivially using the two alternative measures
ot education.

This finding should not be surprising since few women return to

school after their first marriage and since, of those women who do return to
school, very few shift across the broad educational categories which we have
defined.

6. Cross—cohort comparisons of the estimated education effects may be
somewhat biased by cross—cohort changes in mean educational attainment within

the education categories we use. For example, in the 1982 CPS, mean years ot
