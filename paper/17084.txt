Unemployment in an Estimated New Keynesian Model
Jordi Galí, Frank Smets, and Rafael Wouters
NBER Working Paper No. 17084
May 2011
JEL No. D58,E24,E31,E32
ABSTRACT
We reformulate the Smets-Wouters (2007) framework by embedding the theory of unemployment
proposed in Galí (2011a,b). We estimate the resulting model using postwar U.S. data, while treating
the unemployment rate as an additional observable variable. Our approach overcomes the lack of identification
of wage markup and labor supply shocks highlighted by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2008) in their
criticism of New Keynesian models, and allows us to estimate a "correct" measure of the output gap.
In addition, the estimated model can be used to analyze the sources of unemployment fluctuations.

Introduction

Over the past decade an increasing number of central banks and other policy institutions have developed and estimated medium-scale New Keynesian
DSGE models.1 The combination of a good empirical …t with a sound, microfounded structure makes these models particularly suitable for forecasting
and policy analysis. However, as highlighted by Galí and Gerter (2009) and
others, one of the shortcomings of these models is the lack of a reference
to unemployment. This is unfortunate because unemployment is an important indicator of aggregate resource utilization and the central focus of the
policy debate. Recently, a number of papers have started to address this
shortcoming by embedding in the basic New Keynesian model various theories of unemployment based on the presence of labor market frictions (e.g.
Blanchard and Galí (2007), Christo¤el et al (2007), Gertler, Sala and Trigari (2008), Christiano, Trabandt and Walentin (2009), and de Walque et al
(2008)).
The present paper takes a di¤erent approach. Following Gali (2011a,b),
it reformulates the Smets and Wouters (2007; henceforth, SW) model to
allow for involuntary unemployment, while preserving the convenience of
the representative household paradigm. Unemployment in the model results
from market power in labor markets, re‡ected in positive wage markups.
Variations in unemployment over time are associated with changes in wage
markups, either exogenous or resulting from nominal wage rigidities.2

area models used at the ECB. Two of the DSGE models used at the Federal Reserve are

The proposed reformulation allows us to overcome an identi…cation problem pointed out by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2008; henceforth, CKM)
and interpreted by these authors as an illustration of the immaturity of New
Keynesian models for policy analysis. Their observation is motivated by the
SW …nding that wage markup shocks account for almost 50 percent of the
variations in real GDP at horizons of more than 10 years. However, without an explicit measure of unemployment (or, alternatively, labor supply),
these wage markup shocks cannot be distinguished from preference shocks
that shift the marginal disutility of labour. The policy implications of these
two sources of ‡uctuations are, however, very di¤erent. Variations in wage
markup shocks are ine¢ cient and a welfare-maximising government should
be interested in stabilising output ‡uctuations resulting from those shocks
(at least partly). In contrast, output and employment ‡uctuations driven
by preference shocks shifting the labor supply schedule, should in principle be accommodated. Put it di¤erently, the relative importance of those
two shocks will in‡uence the extent to which ‡uctuations in output during
a given historical episode should or should not be interpreted as re‡ecting
movements in the welfare relevant output gap (i.e. the distance between the
actual and e¢ cient levels of output). By including unemployment as an observable variable, this identi…cation problem can be overcome, and "correct"
measures of the output gap can be constructed, as we show in Section 4.
When we estimate the reformulated SW model using unemployment as an
observable variable, we …nd a much diminished role for wage markup shocks
Casares (2010), and Zanetti (2007) for related applications to the New Keynesian model.
After having circulated a …rst draft of the present paper we became aware of Casares,
Moreno and Vázquez (2011), which contains an exercise close in spirit (but with substantial
di¤erences in details) to the one presented here.

as a source of output and employment ‡uctuations, even though those shocks
preserve a large role as drivers of in‡ation. Our estimates lead us to classify
the multiple shocks in the model in three categories (which we label "demand", "supply", and "labor market" shocks), on the basis of their implied
joint comovement among output, employment, the labor force, unemployment, in‡ation and the real wage, as captured by their associated impulse
response functions (IRFs). In addition, we show how the implied measure
of the welfare-relevant output gap is to a large extent the mirror image of
the unemployment rate, and resembles conventional measures of the cyclical
component of log GDP, based on statistical detrending methods (though the
correlation is far from perfect).
Our estimates of the reformulated SW model allow us to address a number of additional questions of interest which could not be dealt with using the
model’s original formulation. Thus, in section 5 we assess quantitatively the
relative importance of di¤erent shocks as sources of unemployment ‡uctuations and their role during speci…c historical episodes, including the recent
recession. Also, our approach allows us to uncover a measure of the natural
rate of unemployment (i.e. the ‡exible wage counterfactual) and to study
its comovement with actual unemployment. That comovement is shown to
be particularly strong at low frequencies, as expected, but the gap between
the two caused by wage rigidities is estimated to be large and persistent. We
also revisit the evidence on the joint behavior of in‡ation and unemployment
under the lens of our estimated model. This allows us to give a structural
interpretation to empirical Phillips curves, both for wage and price in‡ation.
In section 6 we discuss the robustness of our …ndings to the use of alternative

3

sample period and data. Section 7 concludes.
In addition to reformulating the wage equation in terms of unemployment,
our model shows a number of small di¤erences with that in SW (2007). First,
and regarding the data on which the estimation is based, we use employment
rather than hours worked, and rede…ne the wage as the wage per worker
rather than the wage per hour. We do so since the model focuses on variations
in labor at the extensive margin, in a way consistent with the conventional
de…nition of unemployment. Given that most of the variation in hours worked
over the business cycle is due to changes in employment rather than hours
per employee, this change does not have major consequences in itself. We
also combine two alternative wage measures in the estimation, compensation
and earnings, and model their discrepancy explicitly. Second, we generalise
the utility function in a way that allows us to parameterize the strength of
the wealth e¤ect on labour supply, as shown in Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009).
This generalisation yields a better …t of the joint behavior of employment and
the labor force, as we discuss in detail. Third, for simplicity, we revert to
a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator rather than the Kimball aggregator used in SW
(2007).
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the
modi…ed Smets-Wouters model. Next, Section 3 presents the data and estimation. Section 4 contains the discussion of the CKM critique. Section 5
analyses di¤erent aspects of unemployment ‡uctuations which the reformulation of the SW model makes possible. Section 6 presents some robustness
exercises and, …nally, Section 7 concludes.

Introducing Unemployment in the SmetsWouters Model

2.1

Staggered Wage Setting and Wage In‡ation Dynamics

This section introduces a variant of the wage setting block of the SW model,
which is in turn an extension of that in Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000;
henceforth, EHL). The variant presented here, based on Galí (2011a,b), assumes that labor is indivisible, with all variations in hired labor input taking
place at the extensive margin. That feature gives rise to a notion of unemployment consistent with its empirical counterpart.
The model assumes a (large) representative household with a continuum
of members represented by the unit square and indexed by a pair (i; j) 2
[0; 1]

[0; 1]. The …rst dimension, indexed by i 2 [0; 1], represents the type of

labor service in which a given household member is specialized. The second
dimension, indexed by j 2 [0; 1], determines his disutility from work. The
latter is given by

t

tj

'

if he is employed, zero otherwise, where

t

> 0 is an

exogenous preference shifter (referred to below as a "labor supply shock"),
t

is an endogenous preference shifter, taken as given by each individual

household and de…ned below, and '

0 is a parameter determining the

shape of the distribution of work disutilities across individuals.
Individual utility is assumed to be given by:

denoting

(lagged) aggregate consumption (taken as given by each household), and
5

where 1t (i; j) is an indicator function taking a value equal to one if individual (i; j) is employed in period t, and zero otherwise. Thus, as in SW and
related monetary DSGE models, we allow for (external) habits in consumption, indexed by h.
As in Merz (1995), full risk sharing of consumption among household
members is assumed, implying Ct (i; j) = Ct for all (i; j) 2 [0; 1]

[0; 1] and t.

Thus, we can derive the household utility as the integral over its members’
utilities, that is:

Thus Zt can be interpreted as a "smooth" trend for (quasi-di¤erenced)
aggregate consumption. Our preference speci…cation implies a "consumption externality" on individual labor supply: during aggregate consumption

and by introducing

just described. The main role of the latter is to

reconcile the existence of a long-run balanced growth path with an arbitrarily
small short-term wealth e¤ect. The latter’s importance is determined by the
size of parameter

2 [0; 1]. As discussed below in detail, that feature is

needed in order to match the joint behavior of the labor force, consumption
and the wage over the business cycle. That modi…cation is related to, but
not identical, to the one proposed by Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) as a key
ingredient in order to account for the economy’s response to news about
future productivity increases.4
Note that under the previous preferences, the household-relevant marginal
rate of substitution between consumption and employment for type i workers
in period t is given by:

Un(i);t
Uc;t
'
e
t t Ct Nt (i)

M RSt (i)

t Zt Nt (i)

'

In particular, and leaving aside the presence of habits, our speci…cation assumes that
the period utility is separable in consumption and employment, in contrast with that
in Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009). This facilitates aggregation of individual utilities into
the household utility, and simpli…es the analysis by implying equalization of consumption
across individuals in the presence of risk sharing within each household.

where the last equality is satis…ed in a symmetric equilibrium with C t = Ct .
Using lower case letters to denote the natural logarithms of the original variables, we can derive the average (log) marginal rate of substitution

We assume nominal wages are set by "unions," each of which represents
the workers specialized in a given type of labor, and acting in an uncoordinated way. As in EHL, and following the formalism of Calvo (1983), we
assume that the nominal wage for a labor service of a given type can only
be reset with probability 1

w

each period. That probability is indepen-

dent of the time elapsed since the wage for that labor type was last reset,
in addition to being independent across labor types. Thus, and by the law
of large numbers, a fraction of workers

w

do not reoptimize their wage in

any given period, making that parameter a natural index of nominal wage
rigidities. Furthermore, all those who reoptimize their wage choose an identical wage, denoted by Wt , since they face an identical problem. Following
SW, we allow for partial wage indexation between re-optimization periods,
by making the nominal wage adjust mechanically in proportion to past price
in‡ation. Formally, and letting Wt+kjt denote the nominal wage in period
t + k for workers who last reoptimized their wage in period t, we assume
Wt+kjt = Wt+k

When reoptimizing their wage in period t, workers (or the union representing them) choose a wage Wt in order to maximize their respective households
utility (as opposed to their individual utility), subject to the usual sequence
of household ‡ow budget constraints, as well as a sequence of isoelastic demand schedules of the form Nt+kjt = (Wt+kjt =Wt+k )

time, thus leading to changes in workers’market power.

is the (log) average wage markup, i.e. the log deviation between the average

makes clear, variations in wage in‡ation above and beyond those resulting
from indexation to past price in‡ation are driven by deviations of average
wage markup from its natural level, because those deviations generate pressure on workers currently setting wages to adjust those wages in one direction
or another.
One might argue that the previous model provides, if interpreted literally, an unrealistic description of wage setting in the U.S. We view it instead
as a simple modelling device, consistent with the labor market block of the
medium-scale DSGE models currently used for policy analysis (as exempli…ed
by the SW model), and embedding three features of actual labor markets:
(i) nominal wage rigidities, (ii) staggered wage-setting, and (iii) the presence
of average wage levels above their perfectly competitive counterparts, resulting from di¤erent sources of market power by workers which prevent their
underbidding by the unemployed.

Introducing Unemployment

type), that individual will …nd it optimal to participate in the labor market

Evaluating the previous condition at the symmetric equilibrium, and letting the marginal supplier of type i labor be denoted by Lt (i), we have:

Taking logs and integrating over i we obtain
wt
where lt

R1

pt = zt + 'lt +

t

(5)

lt (i) di can be interpreted as the (log) aggregate participation

or labor force.
Following Galí (2011a,b), we de…ne the unemployment rate ut as:
ut

lt

nt

(6)

Note that under our assumptions, the unemployed thus de…ned include
all the individuals who would like to be working (given current labor market
conditions, and while internalizing the bene…ts that this will bring to their
households) but are not currently employed. It is in that sense that one can

11

view unemployment as involuntary.6
Combining (4) with (5) and (6), the following simple linear relation between the average wage markup and the unemployment rate can be derived
w;t

(7)

= 'ut

which is also graphically illustrated in Figure 1.
Finally, combining (3) and (7) we obtain an equation relating wage in‡ation to price in‡ation, the unemployment rate and the wage markup.

(8)

Note that in contrast with the representation of the wage equation found
in SW and related papers, the error term in (8) captures exclusively shocks
to the wage markup, and not preference shocks (even though the latter have
been allowed for in our model). That feature, made possible by reformulating
the wage equation in terms of the (observable) unemployment rate, allows
us to overcome the identi…cation problem raised by CKM in their critique of
New Keynesian models. We turn to this issue below, when we discuss our
empirical …ndings.
Finally, note that we can de…ne the natural rate of unemployment, unt , as
the unemployment rate that would prevail in the absence of nominal wage
rigidities. Under our assumptions, that natural rate will vary exogenously
6

As noted by one of our discussants, unemployed individuals will enjoy a higher utility
ex-post, since their consumption will be the same but won’t experience any disutility from
work. This is, of course, an unavoidable consequence of our assumption of full consumption
risk-sharing within the household. Under the latter assumption, and given the in…nitesimal
weight of each individual in the household, not internalizing the bene…ts to the latter of
an individual’s employment would unavoidably lead to no participation.

simple relation:
n
w;t

(9)

The remaining equations describing the log-linearized equilibrium conditions of the model are presented in the appendix. Those equations are identical to a particular case of the speci…cation in SW (2007), corresponding
to logarithmic consumption utility. In addition to the wage markup and labor supply shocks discussed above, the model includes six additional shocks:
a neutral, factor-augmenting productivity shock, a price markup shock; a
risk premium shock, an exogenous spending shock, an investment-speci…c
technology shock and a monetary policy shock.

Data and Estimation

3.1

Data

We estimate our model on US data for the sample period 1966Q1-2007Q4 using Bayesian full-system estimation techniques as in SW (2007). We end our
estimation period in 2007Q4 to prevent our estimates from being distorted
by the non-linearities induced by the zero lower bound on the federal funds
rate and binding downward nominal wage rigidities during the most recent
recession.7 In Section 5 below we nevertheless use the estimated model to
interpret the behaviour of unemployment in the recent recession, i.e. beyond
7

For some discussion on how downward nominal wage rigidity may distort the the
estimates of the New Keynesian wage Phillips curve, see Gali (2011a).

13

the estimated period. Section 7 on robustness discusses brie‡y the impact of
estimating our model over an extended sample period ending in 2010Q4.
Five of the seven data series used by SW (2007) are also used here: GDP,
consumption, investment, GDP de‡ator in‡ation, and the federal funds rate,
with the …rst three expressed in per capita terms and log di¤erenced. As
the SW model is reformulated in terms of employment (given our interest in
explaining unemployment), we use per capita employment rather than hours
worked. The main results are not a¤ected if we use hours instead, as discussed
in Section 7. In addition, we experiment with two wage concepts. The …rst
one is total compensation per employee obtained from the BLS Productivity
and Costs Statistics.8 The second one is "average weekly earnings" from the
Current Employment Statistics. Finally, we add the unemployment rate as
an additional observable variable. In the following section, we systematically
compare the model estimated with and without the latter variable as an
observable variable.
The properties of both wage series are quite di¤erent.9 This is illustrated
in Figure 2, which plots their quarterly nominal growth rates. First, average
wage in‡ation based on compensation per employee is signi…cantly higher
than that based on earnings per employee (1.24 versus 1.02). Given average
price in‡ation, the compensation series appears more compatible with a balanced growth path in which real wages grow at the same rate as real output,
consumption and investment. Second, the compensation series is much more
volatile than the earnings series, especially over the past two decades. The
8
Note that SW (2007) used compensation per hour instead, in a way consistent with
their model speci…cation.
9
See Abraham, Spletzer and Stewart (1999) and Mehran and Tracy (2001) for a discussion about the sources of some of those di¤erence.

14

standard deviation of wage in‡ation based on compensation is 0.70, compared to 0.56 for the earnings-based series. Finally, the correlation between
both wage in‡ation measures is surprisingly low at 0.60.
For our baseline estimation, we use both wage series as imperfect measures
of the model-based wage concept. This is done by adding measurement error
to the corresponding measurement equations and allowing for a separate,
smaller trend in the earnings series.10 In the section on robustness, we brie‡y
discuss the estimation results when we only use the compensation series. In
the rest of the paper, we focus on the model with both wage concepts and
measurement error.

3.2

Estimation Results

Table 1 compares the estimated structural parameters of the model obtained
with and without unemployment being used as an observable variable. As
discussed above, adding unemployment allows us to separately identify wage
markup and labour supply shocks. In addition, it allows us to exploit the
model’s prediction of proportionality between the unemployment rate and
the wage markup (see equation (7)), in order to identify and estimate the
elasticity of substitution between di¤erent labor types, which in turn determines the steady-state wage markup. In the model without unemployment
this parameter is not identi…ed; instead, we calibrate it to be very similar to
the mean of the estimate in the model with observable unemployment.
Overall, most of the estimated structural parameters are very similar in
10

A similar strategy is followed by Justiniano, Primiceri and Tambalotti (2011). They
show how using a single series (compensation) and not allowing for measurement error
implies a standard deviations for the estimated wage markup shocks that is six times
higher than in their baseline model.

15

the two models.11 Focusing on the parameters that are important for the
labour market, a number of …ndings are worth emphasizing.12 First, the
estimated labour supply elasticity is quite similar whether one uses unemployment or not as an observable variable: the inverse of the Frisch elasticity
increases slightly from 3.3 to 4.0 as one includes unemployment. In the latter
case, the steady state wage markup is identi…ed and estimated to be slightly
below 20 percent, which is consistent with an average unemployment rate of
about 5 percent.
Turning to some of the other parameters that enter the wage Phillips
curve, the estimated degree of wage indexation is relatively small (around
0.15) and robust across the two models. The estimated Calvo probability
of unchanged wages falls somewhat from 0.61 to 0.47, suggesting relatively
‡exible wages with average contract durations of 2 quarters. Overall, the
introduction of unemployment as an observable variable leads to a somewhat
steeper wage Phillips curve.
Third, the parameter, , governing the short-run wealth e¤ects on labour
supply, changes quite dramatically from 0.73 to 0.02. Roughly speaking this
amounts to a change from preferences close to those in King, Plosser and
Rebelo (1988; henceforth, KPR), characterized by strong short-run wealth
e¤ects on labor supply, to a speci…cation closer to that in Greenwood, Hercowitz and Hu¤man (1988). In the latter case, wealth e¤ects are close to
11

A robust feature of the model with observed unemployment is that the labour preference shock and the productivity shock are positively correlated. Allowing for such a
correlation further improves the …t of the model, but does not a¤ect the estimation results
discussed below.
12
Unless otherwise noted, we will consistently refer to the mode of the posterior probability distribution when discussing estimates. Table 1 also reports the mean and 5 and 95

zero in the short run. As discussed below, this helps ensure that not only
employment, but also the labour force moves procyclically in response to
most shocks.13
Finally, it is worth pointing out that the monetary policy reaction coef…cient to the output gap (de…ned as the deviation relative to the constant
markup output), doubles from 0.07 to 0.15. As discussed below, this is mainly
due to the lower volatility of the output gap once unemployment is used to
identify wage markup shocks.

3.3

Impulse Responses

Figures 3 to 5 show the estimated impulse responses of output, in‡ation, the
real wage, the interest rate, employment, the labour force, the unemployment
rate, and the output gap to the eight structural shocks. Figure 3 focuses on
the four "demand" shocks, which include the investment-speci…c technology
shock, the risk premium shock, the exogenous spending shock and the monetary policy shock. We use the label "demand" to refer to those shocks because
they all imply a positive comovement beween output, in‡ation and the real
wage. It is particularly noteworthy that employment and the labour force
comove positively in response to all those shocks. Note, however, that the
size of the labour force response is typically much smaller than that of employment, so that unemployment ‡uctuations are mostly driven by changes
in employment. This is consistent with the unconditional second moments of
detrended data (see, e.g., Galí (2011c), as well as the empirical VAR evidence
13
Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) have argued that small short-run wealth e¤ects on labour
supply are necessary to generate a positive response of output to favorable news about
future productivity.

17

on the e¤ects of monetary policy shocks as shown in Christiano et al. (2010).
Figure 4 reports the dynamic responses to the labour supply and markup
shocks, which we group under the heading of "labor market" shocks. These
shocks generate a negative comovement of in‡ation and the real wage with
output. An adverse wage markup shock has a sizeable positive impact on
price in‡ation and unemployment and a negative one on output, employment
and the output gap, thus generating a clear trade-o¤ for policy makers. On
the other hand, an adverse labor supply shock has similar negative e¤ects on
output, employment and the output gap (and positive e¤ects on in‡ation),
but instead leads to a rise in the output gap and a drop in the unemployment
rate, so that no signi…cant policy trade-o¤ arises. It is this di¤erent e¤ect on
unemployment and the output gap associated with the two labour market
shocks that makes their separate identi…cation so important from a policy
perspective, as further discussed below.
Figure 5 displays the estimated model’s implied impulse responses to
a positive neutral technology shock and a (negative) price markup shock.
We refer to those shocks as "supply" shocks, their distinctive feature being
that they generate simultaneously a procyclical real wage response and a
countercyclical response of in‡ation. It is worth noting, that, in line with
much of the empirical evidence (e.g. Galí (1999), Barnichon (2010)), in our
estimated model a positive technology shock leads to a short-run decline
in employment and a rise in the unemployment rate. This is in contrast
with the predictions of conventially calibrated real business cycle or search
and matching models. Secondly, and in a way analogous to wage markup
shocks, we see that price markup shocks also create a policy trade-o¤ between

18

stabilizing in‡ation and the output gap. This is not the case for technology
shocks, since they drive both these variables in the same direction.
Before turning to several interesting questions that can be addressed with
our estimated model, we wish to emphasize the importance of departing from
conventional KPR preferences in order to match certain aspects of the data.
Note that under standard KPR preferences ( = 1) the labor supply equation
(5) can be written as
wt

pt = ct + 'lt +

t

where habit formation is omitted to simplify the argument. As emphasized by
Christiano et al. (2010) the previous equation is at odds with their empirical
estimates of the e¤ects of monetary policy shocks, which show a countercyclical response of wt

pt

ct coexisting with a procyclical response of

the labor force lt . Instead, under the assumed preferences, a procyclical response of the labor force is consistent with the model as long as the short
run wealth e¤ect is su¢ ciently weak, implying a small adjustment of zt and
hence a procyclical response of wt

pt

zt . This is illustrated in Figure 6

which compares the impulse responses of employment, the labor force and
the unemployment rate to a monetary policy shock under (i) our baseline
estimated model and (ii) an otherwise identical model with KPR preferences
(corresponding to

= 1). Note that in the latter case, and in contrast with

the evidence, the labor force indeed falls signi…cantly following an easing
of monetary policy, amplifying the response of the unemployment rate and
becoming as important a driver of the latter as employment.

Wage Markup vs. Labour Supply Shocks:
Addressing the CKM Critique

In this section we address one of the CKM criticisms pointing to an implausibly large variance of wage markups shocks and a large contribution
of the latter to output and employment ‡uctuations, often implied by estimated DSGE models (e.g. SW (2007)). As argued by CKM, that evidence
cannot be of much use to policymakers since the SW model is not able to
distinguish between wage markup and labor supply shocks. They are e¤ectively "lumped together" as a residual in the wage equation, even though–as
discussed above–they have very di¤erent policy implications.
As discussed above, that problem of incomplete identi…cation is overcome by our reformulation of the SW model using the unemployment rate
as an observable variable.14 In particular, the estimated parameters of the
ARMA(1,1) process for the exogenous wage markup reported in Table 1
imply the latter’s standard deviation drops from 23 to 12 percent once unemployment is included as an observable. Based on equation (7) and the
estimated inverse labour supply elasticity, this implies a standard deviation
of the natural unemployment rate of the order of 3%. This estimate is relatively high, but not unreasonable, especially given that much of that volatility
is concentrated at low frequencies, unrelated to business cycles.
How important are wage markup shocks in driving output and employ14

Justiniano, Primiceri and Tambalotti (2010) seek to overcome that problem by assuming a di¤erent stochastic structure for both driving forces: purely transitory in the
case of markup shocks, and potentially persistent (as allowed for by an AR(1) process) for
the labor supply shock. Their assumption of a white noise wage markup shock is at odds
with our estimated process for that shock, which displays an important low frequency
component.

20

ment ‡uctuations in our estimated model? Table 2 presents the variance
decomposition of the forecast errors of the eight observable variables at the
10 quarter and 10 year horizons. The …rst entry in each cell gives the percent
contribution of each shock to ‡uctuations in each variable in the model with
unemployment as an observable, whereas the second entry given the corresponding share in the model without unemployment. CKM argue that the
contribution of the wage markup shocks to output and employment ‡uctuations (about 50 and 80 percent at the 10 year horizon in the model without
unemployment) was too high to be plausible. Distinguishing labour supply
shocks from wage markup shocks by introducing unemployment helps address this issue. From Table 2 it is clear that the contribution of the wage
markup shocks to output (employment) ‡uctuations at the 10 year horizon
drops substantially, from 45 (77) percent to 17 (39) percent, in the model
with unemployment. Furthermore, in the latter labor supply shocks (which
are now separately identi…ed) account for about 17, 40 and 89 percent of
‡uctuations in output, employment and the labor force respectively (instead
they are ignored in the model without unemployment, as in SW (2007)).
As discussed by CKM, the identi…cation of wage markup and labor supply shocks has implications for monetary policy, since those two shocks have
very di¤erent e¤ects on the e¢ cient level of output and thus on the welfarerelevant output gap. Figure 7 plots the output gap, de…ned as the log deviation between actual output and the level of output that would prevail with
constant mark-ups and ‡exible prices and wages. Two versions of the same
variable are shown, as implied by the estimated models with and without un-

21

employment, respectively.15 Figure 7 shows that the separate identi…cation
of labor supply shocks allowed by our reformulation has a substantial impact
on the estimated output gap, which now looks considerably more stationary.
How does our estimated output gap relate to other variables often used as
cyclical indicators? Figure 8 shows that our estimate of the output gap is to
a large extent the mirror image of the unemployment rate. The correlation
between the two is

0:95. This …nding suggests that variations in wage

markups, whether exogenous or induced by wage rigidities, are a key factor
underlying ine¢ cient output ‡uctuations.16 That …nding is consistent with
the evidence in Galí, Gertler and López-Salido (2007).17
Finally, Figure 9 emphasizes that the model-based output gap resembles conventional measures of the cyclical component of log GDP, based on
a variety of statistical detrending methods (HP …lter, band-pass …lter and
quadratic detrending, as well as the CBO measure).18 There are, however,
periods such as the 2005-2006 boom period with substantial deviations from
the conventional measures. The output gap correlation with each of the four
measures lies in the 0:6

0:8 range, with quadratic detrending showing the

15

Note that, under the assumptions of the model, the output gap thus de…ned will di¤er
from the gap relative the e¢ cient level of output by an additive constant.
16
See also the analysis in Galí (2011b) in the context of a much simpler model. A
similar qualitative …nding is uncovered in Sala, Soderstrom, and Trigari (2010), though
their approach is subject to the CKM critique.
17
It would also appear to be consistent with the evidence on the so-called "labor wedge"
(e.g. Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007), Shimer (2010)). Note, however, that the
concept of "labor wedge" often used in the literature refers to the gap between the marginal
rate of substitution and the marginal product of labor (as opposed to the wage). As a
result (and despite its name) it captures variations in goods makets distortions, like price
markups, in addition to labor market ones.
18
Justiniano, Primiceri and Tambalotti (2011) obtain a qualitatively similar …nding,
using an approach that does not exploit the connection between unemployment and wage
markups, assuming instead a particular stochastic structure for the latter (white noise).

Understanding Unemployment Fluctuations

In the present section we use our estimated model to analyze di¤erent aspects
of unemployment ‡uctuations, which the reformulation of the SW model
makes possible.
First, we can assess the role of wage rigidities as a factor underlying observed unemployment ‡uctuations by comparing the observed unemployment
rate to its estimated natural counterpart, where the latter is de…ned as the
unemployment rate that would be observed in the absence of nominal wage
rigidities, as determined by equation (9). Figure 10 shows the time series
for both variables, together with the gap between the two. The …gure makes
clear that the natural rate of unemployment accounts for a large fraction of
the low-frequency movements in the observed unemployment rate. Yet, it
is clear that the natural rate cannot account for the bulk of unemployment
‡uctuations at business cycle frequencies, which are captured by the unemployment gap. Those ‡uctuations should thus be attributed to the presence
of wage rigidities, interacting with the di¤erent shocks.
The variance decomposition reported in Table 1 shows that about 50
percent of unemployment ‡uctuations at the 10-quarter horizon is due to
"demand " shocks, with a prominent role attributed to risk premium shocks.
The other half is mostly due to wage mark-up shocks. In the longer run (10year horizon), the contribution of demand shocks drops to 17 percent and
wage markup shocks become the dominant driving force. Interestingly, those
wage markup shocks also explain a dominant share of the ‡uctuations in
23

price and wage in‡ation at all horizons. In contrast, labor supply and other
supply shocks have only a limited impact on unemployment. The labor force
instead is mostly driven by labor supply shocks, with most other shocks
having a very limited impact on that variable.
The importance of demand and wage markup shocks in driving unemployment can also be illustrated by means of the historical decomposition
depicted in Figure 11. The secular rise of unemployment and in‡ation in
the 1970s and early 1980s is mostly driven by cost-push factors coming from
increasing wage markups. This is reversed in the mid 1980s. On the other
hand, most of the unemployment ‡uctuations at business cycle frequencies
are seen to be driven by demand shocks. This is particularly the case since the
early 1990s. Both the 2001 and 2007-2008 recessions are driven by negative
demand shocks. Figure 12 zooms in on the most recent recession, displaying
the contribution of each individual shock to the rise of unemployment over
this period. We see that about three quarters of the 5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is due to demand factors, with adverse risk
premium shocks playing a large role at the start of the crisis, thus capturing
the tightening of …nancial conditions. As of 2009 our estimates identify an
"e¤ective" tightening of monetary policy, which we attribute to the attainment of the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate, and which is shown
to contribute about 1 to 2 percentage points to the rise in the unemployment
rate. Finally, it is also worth noting that our estimates suggest a signi…cant
contribution of wage markup shocks to the recent rise in the unemployment
rate. As conjectured by Gali (2011a), this may be due to downward nominal
wage rigidities interacting with very low in‡ation, which may have prevented

24

the average real wage from adjusting as much as it would be warranted by
the decline in in‡ation and the rise in unemployment.
Finally, we can use the estimated model to interpret the observed comovements between the unemployment rate and measures of wage and price
in‡ation. With that objective, Figure 13 displays the joint variation in wage
in‡ation and the unemployment rate conditional on each shock, as well as
their unconditional joint variation (bottom-right diagram). The evidence
makes clear that whatever Phillips-curve-like negative comovement between
wage in‡ation and unemployment can be found in the data it is largely the
result of the four demand shocks. By contrast, wage markup shocks generate
what looks like a positive lower frequency comovement in both variables, and
are largely reponsible for the lack of a clean Phillips-curve-like pattern in the
observed data. Supply shocks, on the other hand, lead to a near-zero comovement. Note that this is still consistent with wage in‡ation equation (3)
(given the forward-looking nature of the latter), for their implied responses
of unemployment display a sign switch (see Figure 5), thus leaving wage
in‡ation largely unchanged as a result.
Figure 14 displays analogous evidence for unemployment and price in‡ation. As in the case of wage in‡ation, the four demand shocks generate a
clear negative comovement between price in‡ation and the unemployment
rate, while wage markup shocks underlie a low frequency positive comovement. Contrary to traditional textbook analyses, productivity shocks are
also shown to generate a negative comovement between price in‡ation and
the unemployment rate. On the other hand, price markup shocks produce a
nearly vertical Phillips curve, since their impact on the unemployment rate

25

is tiny, while their e¤ect on price in‡ation is substantial.

6

Robustness

In this section we brie‡y summarize the …ndings based on a number of alternative speci…cations. First, we use hours worked rather than employment as
our measure of labour input. While the benchmark model is written in terms
of employment, the actual labour input that enters the production function
should be total hours worked. Using employment will therefore distort the
estimated productivity process. When we use hours, we leave the unemployment rate unchanged, thus making the implicit assumption that those who
are unemployed want to work the same number of hours as those who are employed.19 In that alternative speci…cation we also use wage per hour. When
we leave the model unchanged but use hours worked rather than employment as our measure of labour input, the main results emphasized above are
not a¤ected. The full set of results is available on request. Two di¤erences
are worth mentioning. First, as expected, the contribution of productivity
shocks to output ‡uctuations becomes less important. Second, the degree
of wage rigidity is estimated to be higher (0.60) and as a result the slope of
the Phillips curve becomes less steep, due to the greater cyclical volatility of
wage per worker relative to wage per hour.
Second, we also estimate the model using only the compensation series as
a wage measure. Again, the main results are unchanged. The main impact of
the higher volatility in the compensation series is to increase the estimate of
19

In order to address these issues, ideally we need to explicitly include the intensive
margin, i.e. hours worked per employee, in the model and re-estimate it accordingly.
That extension is part of our currently ongoing research.

26

the inverse Frisch elasticity of the labour supply to 5.6 when unemployment
is added. With higher observed volatility of wages, the response of labour
supply to real wages is estimated to be less. This has an additional impact
on some of the other parameters, such as the degree of habit formation.
Thirdly, we have also estimated the model under KPR preferences (i.e.,
imposing

= 0) and an alternative set of Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences where

the Zt factor evolves in line with aggregate productivity instead of aggregate
consumption. The model with KPR preferences leads to a signi…cant deterioration of the empirical …t by about 15 points. As discussed above, in this
case the labor force moves countercyclically in response to monetary policy
and other demand shocks. However, the modi…ed JR model leads to a signi…cantly improved empirical …t by about 28 points. Moreover, the parameter
rises back to 0.9 (from 0.02 in the baseline model) suggesting that in response
to productivity shocks the data prefer stronger short-run wealth e¤ects on
labor supply. We still need to think harder about the interpretation of these
results.
Finally, we have also re-estimated our model using data up to 2010Q4,
thus ignoring the potential problems raised earlier (likely mis-speci…cation
of the interest rate rule and the wage equation due to nonlinearities at work
during this period). The main di¤erence with the benchmark results is that
the estimated wage stickiness rises and the overall persistence in the economy
as captured by the persistence of the shocks also goes up.

Conclusion

In this paper we have developed a reformulated version of the Smets-Wouters
(2007) framework that embeds the theory of unemployment proposed in Galí
(2011a,b). We estimate the resulting model using postwar U.S. data, while
treating the unemployment rate as an additional observable variable. This
helps overcome the lack of identi…cation of wage markup and labor supply
shocks highlighted by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2008) in their criticism
of New Keynesian models. In turn, our approach allows us to estimate a
"correct" measure of the output gap. In addition, the estimated model can
be used to analyze the sources of unemployment ‡uctuations.
A number of key results emerge from our analysis. First, we show that
wage markup shocks play a smaller role in driving output and employment
‡uctuations than previously thought. Secondly, ‡uctuations in our estimated
output gap are shown to be the near mirror image of those experienced by the
unemployment rate, and to be well approximated by conventional measures
of the cyclical component of GDP. Thirdly, demand shocks are the main
driver of unemployment ‡uctuations at business cycle frequencies, but wage
markup shocks are shown to be more important at lower frequencies. Finally,
our estimates point to an adverse risk-premium shock as the key force behind
the initial rise in unemployment during the Great Recession. The important
role uncovered for monetary policy and wage markup shocks at a later stage
may be interpreted as capturing the likely e¤ects of the zero lower bound on
the nominal rate and of downward wage rigidities (as opposed to those of
truly exogenous shocks).
