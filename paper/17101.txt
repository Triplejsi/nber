Estimating Ricardian Models With Panel Data

NBER Working Paper No. 17101

JEL No. Q1,Q12,Q51,Q54
ABSTRACT
Many nonmarket valuation models, such as the Ricardian model, have been estimated using cross
sectional methods with a single year of data. Although multiple years of data should increase the robustness
of such methods, repeated cross sections suggest the results are not stable. We argue that repeated
cross sections do not properly specify the model. Panel methods that correctly specify the Ricardian
model are stable over time. The results suggest that many cross sectional methods including hedonic
studies and travel cost studies could be enhanced using panel data.

Introduction
The traditional Ricardian model is a cross sectional analysis that measures the long term

impacts of climate change on agriculture (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, and Shaw 1994) (MNS). The
technique has been applied successfully in over 27 countries across the world (Mendelsohn and
Dinar 2009). However, the technique has almost always been applied to just a single year of data
(Sanghi and Mendelsohn 2008; Mendelsohn, Dinar and Sanghi 2001 are exceptions). Applying
the method to repeated cross sections reveals that these single year studies do not lead to stable
results over time (Deschenes and Greenstone 2007) (DG). Instead of cross sectional analysis, DG
argue that one should focus on the intertemporal variation in weather to detect climate change
effects.
We argue that the intertemporal variation is simply not as useful as the cross sectional
variation for measuring climate change effects. The purpose of these studies is to measure the
impacts of climate change (changes in long term weather) on agriculture. Interannual changes in
weather are a poor proxy for climate. Weather changes are surprises to farmers. Farmers only
have limited opportunities to adapt to weather. In contrast, climate is long run weather. Farmers
can do a great deal to adapt to changes in climate. For example, they can adjust which crops to
plant (Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn 2008; Seo and Mendelsohn 2008a) and which livestock
to raise (Seo and Mendelsohn 2008b). Studying the impact of weather cannot capture any of
these adjustments to climate. The intertemporal analysis of weather may provide an accurate
measurement but of the wrong phenomenon.
Further, we argue that if panel data is available for the Ricardian method, repeated cross
sections are the wrong way to estimate the consequences. Instead, one should use panel data

1

methods that properly specify which coefficients should vary over time and which should remain
stable. Correct specification applies to far more than just the Ricardian model. There are many
cross sectional methods that have been developed to measure the value of the environment.
Hedonic property value studies have been used to value natural resource amenities such as
waterfront (Parsons and Wu 1991) or proximity to open space and disamenities such as
hazardous waste sites and airport noise (see review by Palmquist and Smith 2002). Hedonic
wage studies have measured the value of risk as a factor in wages (see reviews by Mrozek and
Taylor 2002 and Viscusi and Aldy 2003). Travel cost studies have measured the recreational
value of natural resources such as parks, coral reefs, and forests (see review by Mendelsohn and
Olmstead 2009).
DG use a series of independent cross sectional regressions to estimate a set of Ricardian
models. They find that, at least for this application of the Ricardian method, the results across the
regressions are not stable. They raise doubts about using cross sectional valuation methods at all.
However, there are some problems with the DG analysis. We revise the original DG analysis to
correct for climate data problems, missing observations, omitted variables, and functional form.
We then re-examine the results from repeated cross sections.
We compare the results or the repeated cross section with the results from panel methods.
We argue that repeated cross sections are mis-specified. If carefully specified, the results are
robust. We present two panel data approaches, a two stage model by Cheng Hsiao (2008) and a
single stage “pooled” model. Using US data from the same Census time periods as the DG study,
we show that both panel data approaches yield stable results. The results imply that panel
methods would likely work not only for Ricardian studies but also for other cross sectional
models such as hedonic and travel cost studies.

Methodology
The Ricardian method assumes the value of farmland  V  is equal to the present value of

net revenue from farm related activities (MNS, 1994). Land values are therefore equal to:
V

  PQI,C,G,S   R' I  e

 t

dt

,

(1)

where V is the value of farmland per hectare, P is the market price of output, Q is output, I is a
vector of purchased inputs (other than land), C is a vector of climate variables, G is a vector of
geographic variables, S is a vector of soil variables, R is a vector of input prices, t is time and δ
is the discount rate. Farmers are assumed to maximize net revenues by choosing I, given climate,
soil, geographic variables, market prices, and other exogenous socio-economic conditions.
Solving (1) to maximize net revenue leads to a reduced form model where V is strictly a
function of the exogenous variables facing a farmer: S, G, C, R, r, and Z. In this paper, we focus
on applying the Ricardian model to a panel data set. For expositional purposes, we group these
variables into a vector of time varying variables, X, a vector of time invariant control variables
Z, and a vector of climate variables C. The time varying variables include population density,
income, subsidies, and residential housing prices. The time invariant variables (at least over the
panel) include soil and geographic variables. The Ricardian model has the general form:
V  f ( X, Z, C )

.

(2)

Traditionally, the Ricardian model is estimated across a single cross section:
Vi  X i β  Z i γ  Ci   u i

,

(3)

where i varies across space. The relationship between the climate variables and land value is
assumed to be quadratic so that the climate vector includes squared terms. Because the effect of

3

climate on land value varies across seasons (MNS 1994), temperature and precipitation are
introduced for each of four seasons. The estimated coefficients in the model are β, γ, and φ.
Following DG, we control for heteroscedasticity with Weighted Least Squares (WLS). As with
DG, we use farmland by county in each year for a weight. Following Schlenker, Hanemann, and
Fisher (2005), we also correct for spatial correlation following the non-parametric approach of
Conley (1999).
DG estimate the Ricardian model using repeated independent cross sections. They
estimate the following model with panel data:
Vi , t  X' i, t β t  Z' i γ t  C' i  t  u i , t ,

(4)

where X i'.t is now a matrix of time varying control variables. The estimated coefficients are all
matrices. That is, the coefficients are all allowed to vary over time:  t ,  t , and  t . DG argue that
the resulting Ricardian model is nonsensical because  k   l over time in their regressions.
However, we argue that repeated cross sections are effectively mis-specified because the
coefficients of the time varying variables should not change over time. In an ideal panel data
model, the coefficients of the time invariant variables should also not change. The correctly
specified Ricardian model is:
Vi , t  X' i, t β  Z' i γ  C' i   u i , t ,

(5)

where β, γ, and φ are time invariant vectors. By allowing β and γ to vary over time, the repeated
cross section causes φ to also vary.

4

We explore two ways to estimate the Ricardian model with panel data. One way is to
pool the entire data set and estimate the model above in a single stage using Equation (5). The
second approach is to estimate two stages (Cheng Hsiao 2008). In the first stage, land value is
regressed on the time varying variables using the covariance method with county fixed effects:
Vi ,t  X i',t β  e α i   i ,t

,

(6)

where e is a vector of county fixed effects (dummies), and  i,t is the resulting error term. By
including county fixed effects, the first stage in the Hsiao model does a better job of controlling
for omitted variables that are correlated with space. In the second stage, the time-mean residuals
are regressed on the time invariant variables using WLS:1
Vi  X i' βˆ CV  e i   i  Z i' γ  C i'   u i .

(7)

In order to test whether the climate coefficients are stable over time, we estimate a
variant of both panel models. For both the Hsiao model and the pooled model, we allow the
climate coefficients to change over time. In the Hsiao model, the first stage of the model remains
the same. However, in the second stage, we estimate a separate set of coefficients, φt , for each
year:

Vi ,t  X i',t βˆ CV  Z i' γ  Ci' t  ui ,t ,

(8)

where the coefficients associated with climate are allowed to vary over time. The model is
equivalent to creating a set of time dummies for each year and interacting these time dummies

with the climate variables. Instead of a single set of coefficients for the climate variables, one has
a different estimate for each year.
With the “pooled” model, we interact the climate variables with year dummies. They are
then combined with the time varying variables in a single regression on land value:
Vi ,t  X i',t β  Z 'i γ  C 'i  t  ui ,t .

(9)

This model yields a set of coefficients for all the climate variables for each year. One can then
test whether the coefficients are stable over time.
The welfare impact W of climate change on US agriculture is obtained by computing the
difference between the value of farmland under the new climate and the value of farmland under
the current climate. We use the estimated coefficients, the average farmland in each county, and
the predicted change in climate from C0 to C1:
Wt   i Vi ,t (C1 )  Vi ,t (C0 )  Fi .

(10)

Of course, the best forecast of welfare effects in the future should rely on the expected
value of farmland in the future not the past. This would require modeling not only how farmland
is expected to change over time from technological and economic forces but also how it might
change in response to climate change (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, and Shaw 1996). In the present
analysis, we employ a less sophisticated approach and we use as expected value of farmland the
average number of acres in farmland over the observed Census years.

Data

Following DG, we have constructed a balanced panel with observations from the
contiguous 48 States over the U.S. Agricultural Census years of 1978, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997

6

and 2002. Units of measurement follow the metric system; economic variables have all been
converted to constant 2000 USD using the GDP deflator. There are many counties missing in
the DG analysis. The DG analysis has only 2124 counties of the 3048 counties in the lower 48
states that have agriculture. We are able to include 2914. Our analysis is based on 97% of US
farmland whereas the DG analysis is based on only 72%. The omission of so many counties has
implications for both the estimation of the regressions and the calculation of welfare effects.2
Because there are data errors in the DG climate variables (see Fisher et al 2010), we rely
on the 1971-2000 monthly precipitations and mean temperature normals computed by the
National Climatic Data Center for 7,467 weather stations in the contiguous 48 States. The
standard definition of a climate normal is the average weather over a 30 year period. Following
MNS, we estimate a quadratic climate surface as a function of longitude, latitude, elevation and
distance from coastline, for the contiguous 48 States. For each county of origin, we calculate the
weather surface using the weather stations within 500 miles. The data is weighted to give nearby
stations more weight. The predicted values from that surface are used to yield monthly climate
variables for each county. The seasonal climate is the arithmetic average of climate variables in
winter (December, January, February), spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August)
and autumn (September, October, November).
For farmland value, land in farms, and other agricultural data, we rely on the U.S. Census
of Agriculture (USDA 1978, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002). The dependent variable in our
panel is the average estimated value of land and buildings per hectare of land in farm.

2

It is not clear why DG omit so many counties from their analysis since data is available for

most of them.

7

One point stressed by DG is that it is important to include missing variables. We include
several variables not used in DG or MNS. We measure the long-term availability of water to
farmers using the average fresh surface water withdrawals by county over time (United States
Geological Survey, 1988, 1993, 1998, 2004). Because water rights are based on use in the U.S.,
average withdrawals capture underlying water rights and can be largely considered as exogenous
(Mendelsohn and Dinar 2003). Data about greenhouses by county are included from the Census
of Agriculture. The analysis also captures subsidies as measured by the Census of Agriculture. In
order to control for local land markets, we use the median value of owner-occupied housing in
each county as a proxy for the opportunity cost of keeping land in farms. These data are
available at the county level from the US Census of Population and Housing every ten years. We
extrapolate house values using linear trends between Census years.

IV.

Results

In the Appendix, we present the regression results of estimating the repeat cross sections across
the six years of data (Table A1). Note that all the coefficients are permitted to vary and that they
are in general not stable. Of particular importance is the instability of the climate coefficients.
Even correcting for functional form, missing observations, errors in climate variables, and
omitted variables, the climate coefficients vary over time. This can be readily seen by calculating
the marginal effects of temperature and precipitation in Table 1. The seasonal and annual
marginals vary a great deal of over time.

The seasonal temperature marginals are quite

significant but they are offsetting so that the annual temperature marginals are not significant. In
contrast, both the seasonal and annual precipitation marginals are significant.

The range of climate coefficients across time can also be seen by calculating the welfare
impacts of a uniform temperature increase of 2.7˚C with an 8 percent increase in precipitation
(the scenario used in MNS and DG). Using this same climate change but the different climate
coefficients estimated in each year, Figure 1 demonstrates that the welfare results from this
uniform change are not the same across years with the repeated cross sections.

Using the same data set, functional form, and variables that are used in the repeated cross
sections, we estimate the Hsiao and pooled models. The first stage of the Hsiao model includes
income, density, density squared, greenhouses, subsidies, and residential housing values, time
dummies for each year, and county fixed effects (which are not reported). There is a single
coefficient for each time varying variable. The second stage includes geographic, soils, and
climate variables. The pooled model has the exact same independent variables except that county
fixed effects are not utilized.
For both the Hsiao and pooled models, Table 2A presents the coefficients of the time
varying variables and Table 2B presents the coefficients of the time invariant variables. In Table
2A the R2 values for the Hsiao model are high because they include county fixed effects that are
not shown. Comparing the coefficients of the time varying variables in the Hsiao and pooled
models, income, density and density squared are significantly different. In the pooled model,

income has a much larger positive effect but density and density squared have a much smaller
effect. The coefficients of the remaining time varying variables in the two regressions are quite
similar.
The coefficients of the time invariant variables in the Hsiao and pooled models in Table 2B
are not significantly different. The major difference between the two models is that the
t-statistics of the pooled model are higher because the pooled model assumes there are more
observations. The true number of independent observations lies between the two methods and
depends upon whether there are independent errors because of random intertemporal fluctuations
suggesting more observations or whether there are consistent errors across time suggesting fewer
observations.

Table 3 examines the marginal temperature and precipitation effects of the two panel
estimates. Note that the seasonal marginals for both temperature and precipitation are highly
significant. However, the annual marginal temperature is not significant. The seasonal effects are
offsetting leading to a small annual consequence. The marginal effect of annual precipitation is
significant and positive in both models.

Table 4 presents the welfare results from the panel regressions. The uniform climate
change scenario of a 2.7C° warming with an 8 percent increase in precipitation leads to benefits
of $15 billion in both the Hsiao and pooled models. This amounts to a 1.5 percent increase in
land value.
The confidence intervals for the welfare impacts of climate change in Table 4 have been
derived by the bootstrap method using 1,000 repetitions. The welfare estimates have very large
error bands around them. This may seem surprising given the tight estimates of the individual

13

climate coefficients. However, many of the highly significant seasonal climate variables work in
opposite directions so that the net annual effect is small and insignificant.
In order to test whether the panel models do a better job of stabilizing coefficients
compared to the repeated cross sectional model, we estimate time varying coefficients with the
panel model. In Table 5, we present the Hsiao model with time varying climate coefficients. In
Table 6, we present the pooled model with time varying coefficients. The climate coefficients
have the same sign and the same order of magnitude over time. However, the coefficients are not
identical. The F-test for whether all the climate coefficients are the same is 8.27; the F-test of the
temperature coefficients yields a value of 6.04 and the F-test of the precipitation coefficients
yields a value of 3.50. The climate coefficients are not identical.

Notes: All dollar figures are in billions of 2000 USD. Percentage impacts are in parenthesis. Welfare impacts
correspond to a uniform increase of temperature of 2.7°C and of 8 percent of precipitation.

In Table 7, we present the welfare results with the time varying climate coefficients. We
also show the results of the repeated cross section for comparison. The Hsiao panel regression
results are more robust than the repeated cross section. The pooled results are especially stable
across time. Despite the fact that the Hsiao model does a better job of controlling for missing
cross sectional variables, the pooled model givens the best results.

Conclusion

This paper examines the possibility of using panel data to estimate cross sectional valuation
models such as the Ricardian model. Repeated cross sectional analyses such as presented in DG
are not robust. We argue that this is because they are mis-specified. The coefficients of time
varying and time invariant variables are allowed to vary over time in the repeated cross sections.
We argue the correctly specified model holds these coefficients constant.

17

We explore two panel data models that are properly specified. The result is a highly
significant model that predicts climate coefficients with a high degree of accuracy. In order to
test whether the panel data models have done a good job of stabilizing climate estimates across
years, we estimate year-specific climate effects. Whereas the repeated cross sectional models
produce widely varying effects, the two panel models predict much more stable results. The
pooled model produces the best results.
DG use their analysis of the Ricardian model to advocate the use of intertemporal weather
analysis. However, it is important to recognize that the Ricardian and intertemporal models are
not measuring the same thing. The relationship between annual farm profits and weather is an
unbiased measure of the impact of abrupt climate change or weather. However, analyzing
weather effects does not capture adaptation and so it is a biased (too pessimistic) measure of the
long term effects of climate change. The Ricardian approach, in turn, provides a biased (too
optimistic) estimate of the impact of abrupt climate change or weather. But the Ricardian method
captures adaptation and so it is an unbiased estimate of the impact of long term climate change.
The results of the analysis of weather and climate are quite different. Whereas every farmer
in the world is concerned about weather, the effect of climate will vary a great deal depending on
where a farm is located. Farms in relatively cool locations will benefit but farms in warmer
locations are likely to be hurt. Even within the United States, farms in the northern US may see
large benefits whereas farms along the southern edges of the US will be harmed. The analysis
also suggests that farms in the Western US will be hurt. The losses can be even larger in tropical
countries in Africa (Kurukulasuriya et al. 2005) or Latin America (Seo and Mendelsohn 2008c).

18

This study develops a panel data method for estimating Ricardian models. The results reveal
that the climate coefficients are far more accurate than coefficients from repeated cross sections.
The results suggest that many cross sectional valuation methods may benefit from panel data
provided they estimate their panel data models correctly.

Data Appendix

We have constructed a balanced panel with observations for 2,914 counties in the contiguous 48
States over the years 1978, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997 and 2002. Units of measurement are in the
metric system; economic variables have all been converted to constant 2000 USD using the GDP
deflator. If not otherwise stated, variables measure data of interest in years 1978, 1982, 1987,
1992, 1997 and 2002.

pasture or grazing, provided it was part of the farm operator’s total operation. Large acreages of
woodland or wasteland held for nonagricultural purposes were deleted from individual reports.
Land in farms includes acres in the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve Programs. Land
in farms is an operating unit concept and includes land owned and operated as well as land

Population and Housing, 1980, 1990 and 2000. Values for panel years have been computed
extrapolating linear trends from the three census years available.

II. TIME INVARIANT, COUNTY SPECIFIC, CLIMATE VARIABLES
Climate Variables ― We have estimated quadratic climate surfaces for the contiguous 48 States
following the approach described in MNS (1994). The data source for climate normals is the
National Climatic Data Center CLIM81 series, which contains monthly station normals (19712000) for 7,467 weather stations in the contiguous 48 States, of which 2,135 provide only
precipitation data. For each county we select weather stations contained in a 500 miles radius
circle centered at the county’s centroid and we estimate local monthly climate by applying
Weighted Least Squares to a quadratic combination of stations’ longitude, latitude, elevation,
and distance from coastline; as weights we use the squared distance between the county’s
centroid and the weather station. Seasonal climate is obtained as the arithmetic average of
climate variables in Winter (December, January, February), Spring (March, April, May),
Summer (June, July, August) and Autumn (September, October, November). Temperatures are
measured in degrees Celsius and precipitations are measured in millimeters.

III. TIME INVARIANT, COUNTY SPECIFIC SOIL CHARACTERISTICS
Salinity ― Percentage of agricultural land that has salinity-sodium problems.
Flooding ― Percentage of agricultural land occasionally or frequently prone to flooding.
Wet Factor ― Percentage of agricultural land that has very low drainage (Poor and Very Poor).
Kfactor ― Average soil erodibility factor. It is the average soil loss in tons/acre; is a measure of
the susceptibility of soil particles to detachment and transport by rainfall and runoff.
Slope Length ― Average slope length factor, feet.
Sand ― Percentage of agricultural land classified as sand or coarse-textured soils.
Clay ― Percentage of agricultural land that is classified as clay.
Moisture Level ― Minimum value for the range of available water capacity for the soil layer or
horizon, expressed as inches/inch.
Permeability ― The minimum value for the range in permeability rate for the soil layer or
horizon, expressed as inches/hour.

IV. TIME INVARIANT, COUNTY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC VARIABLES

Latitude ― Latitude of county’s centroid in decimal degrees.
Elevation ― Elevation of county’s centroid in meters.
Distance from Metropolitan Areas ― Distance in kilometers between county’s centroid and
metropolitan areas with more than 200,000 inhabitants in 2000.

22

Surface Water Withdrawal ― Thousands of liters per hectare, per day, of surface fresh water for
irrigation purposes. The “Estimated Use of Water in the United States”, published every five
years by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), supplies data on water use at county level
only starting from 1985. We divided the amount of water used at county level for years 1985,
1990, 1995, 2000 by the amount of farmland in that county in Census years 1987, 1992, 1997
and 2002, respectively, and we computed the time average of surface water use per hectare of
land. We used this variable as a proxy for surface water availability, at county level, for all time
observations of our panel.
