Maternity Leave and Children’s Cognitive and Behavioral Development
Michael Baker and Kevin S. Milligan
NBER Working Paper No. 17105
June 2011, Revised August 2014
JEL No. I18,J13,J32
ABSTRACT
We investigate the impact of maternity leave on the cognitive and behavioral development of children
at ages 4 and 5, following up previous research on these children at younger ages. The impact is identified
by legislated increases in the duration of maternity leave in Canada, which significantly increased
the amount of first-year maternal care. Our results indicate no positive effect on indices of children’s
cognitive and behavioral development. We uncover a small negative impact on cognitive scores, which
may indicate the timing of the mother/child separation due to the mother’s return to work plays a role.

Introduction
Governments around the world seek to improve child development at young ages as a
means both to promote equity and to improve the efficiency of human capital accumulation.
Policies range from maternal education and nutrition programs to childcare and early childhood
education initiatives.1 Parental leave policies have been central to this push in more developed
countries.2 In many cases, child development is cited as an important basis for legislative
parental leave initiatives. The ‘findings’ preamble to the American Family and Medical leave Act
states “…it is important for the development of children and the family unit that fathers and
mothers be able to participate in early childrearing…”.3 A recent Australian paid parental leave
program was promoted with the claim that “the scheme will give more babies the best start in
life. The payment will enable more parents to stay at home to care for their baby full-time during
the vital early months of social, cognitive and physical development” (Commonwealth of
Australia 2009). An extension of paid maternity leave in the United Kingdom seeks to “…give
children the best start in life…” as the “…evidence confirms the value of consistent one-to-one
care in the first year of a child’s life.” (Employment Relations Directorate 2006, p. 2).
In this paper, we study a Canadian reform that expanded parental leave entitlement by
about half a year in the first year of life. The reform had a large impact on the time mothers spent
at home in their child’s first year—about two months averaged across all mothers, or 3 months
when averaged across likely eligible mothers.4 We relate this variation in maternal employment
to measures of children’s cognitive and non-cognitive development at ages 4 and 5—
immediately prior to school entry.
See, for example, the report prepared for the World Health Organization (Irwin, Siddiqi, and Hertzman 2007) or
UNICEF (2006).

Earlier work by Baker and Milligan (2010) examines the effect of this same Canadian
policy reform at ages up to 24 months. In that paper, we find a large shift toward maternal care
and away from home-based care in the first year of life. This extra maternal care in the first year
of life was found to have little impact on health and development indicators up to the age of 24
months. The measures studied in that paper are of parenting and of children’s motor and social
development, exhibited security, temperament and milestones of physical development (e.g., first
steps). As the children affected by this large reform have grown older, we now have the unique
opportunity to further evaluate their development as they hit the critical ages at which ‘school
readiness’ can be assessed.
Examining the further progress of this cohort of children who received a substantially
larger amount of maternal care is informative for a number of reasons.
1. While not common in economics, follow up studies have been critical to our
understanding of the impact of early childhood interventions on child development. For
example, the near universal acknowledgment of the profound impact of the Perry
Preschool Study is due to the ongoing longitudinal study of the program’s children that
repeatedly comes to the same conclusion. In contrast, the uncertain lessons from the Head
Start program are due to follow up study that suggests the program’s initial impacts fade
out over time.
2. It is widely acknowledged that the development of very young children is rapid and
multidimensional, and that cognitive testing of very young children (2 years or younger)
is very challenging (e.g., Bradley-Johnson 2001, Saye 2003). As a result, best practice
counsels evaluating children with multiple assessments at different ages.

3

3. There is evidence from previous research that the developmental impact of maternal
employment may not manifest until the child is aged 3 years or older (Brooks-Gunn et al.
2002).5
4. Indicators of cognitive and non cognitive development at ages 4 and 5 have welldocumented links to future outcomes (e.g., Almond and Currie 2011).
Against this background, many studies of early childhood policies up to now are “one off”
analyses. Therefore, we cannot know whether any documented effects fade out at later ages, or if
evidence of no effect persists.
Several recent papers have investigated the long-run impact of parental leave expansions
on education attainment and early labor market performance.6 Dustmann and Schonberg (2012)
look into changes to Germany’s paid leave program that increased paid leave from 2 to 6 months
in the late 1970s, and from 6 to 10 months in the mid-1980s.7 They find little evidence that this
expansion of leave affected children’s selective school attendance or wages. Rasmussen (2010)
examines an increase in paid parental leave, from 14 to 20 weeks, in Denmark in the mid-1980s.
She finds no impact on children’s high school enrollment and completion, or on grade point
average. Liu and Skans (2010) investigate an extension of paid parental leave from 12 to 15
months in Sweden in the late 1980s. They report no average impact on children’s test scores and
grades at age 16, although there is a positive effect for the children of well-educated mothers.
Danzer and Lavy (2012) look at the impact on age 15 test scores of a reform in Austria in 1990,
finding no significant impact in the overall sample (although preliminary evidence points to a
positive impact for boys born to highly educated mothers). Finally, and in contrast, Carneiro et

Brooks-Gunn et al. (2002) find that the cognitive impact of maternal employment in the children’s first year of life
manifest by 36 months but not at earlier ages.
6
A more detailed review of this literature can be found in Baker (2011).
7
A third reform considered in the analysis is an increase in unpaid leave from 18 to 36 months in the early 1990s.

al. (2011) find the introduction of 4 months of paid leave in Norway in the late 1970s did have
positive impacts on children’s educational attainment; most notably a reduction in the high
school dropout rate. This long-run evidence does not reveal consistent findings of a significant
long-run impact of parental leave.
Research on the more immediate effects of maternal employment on child development
during the early years has pointed toward a more negative impact.8 A number of studies report
negative impacts of maternal employment anytime in the first year on cognitive development,
although the estimates vary in magnitude (e.g., Bernal 2008, Hill et al. 2005, James-Burdumy
2005 and Ruhm 2004).9 Waldfogel (2006) in her review of the literature concludes “…children
whose mothers work in the first year of life, particularly if they work full time, do tend to have
lower cognitive test scores at age three and thereafter.” (p. 55) There is also evidence that
entrance into non parental care in the first year can have negative cognitive and behavioral
effects (e.g., O’Brien Caughy et al. 1994, Gregg et al. 2005, Lefebvre et al. 2008, Loeb et al.
2007).10

Lucas-Thompson et al. (2010) provides a summary of some of the research cited here as well as of studies on the
developmental impact of maternal employment from other fields.
9
Ruhm (2004) reports reductions in PPVT scores of 7-8 percent of a standard deviation from maternal employment
in the first year, with the largest effects from full time employment. James-Burdumy (2005) and Hill et al. (2005)
find maternal employment in the first year has smaller negative effects on math and reading scores measured at ages
5-18 (PPVT and the Peabody Individual Achievement Tests). Finally, Bernal (2008) reports that a full year of full
time maternal employment in the first five years of life reduces test scores by 0.13 of standard deviation (PPVT and
the Peabody Individual Achievement Tests.
10
O’Brien Caughy et al. (1994) report that entrance into daycare before the first birthday was associated with higher
test scores (Peabody Individual Achievement Tests ) for lower income children and lower test scores for higher
income children. For the U.K. Gregg et al. (2005) find that children who receive informal care from friends and
relatives in the first 18 months of life combined with full time maternal employment have lower cognitive outcomes.
In the Canadian context, Lefebvre et al. (2008) report that Quebec’s universal, low fee childcare program, which
serves children from birth, is related to reductions in PPVT scores of just under one-third of a standard deviation.
Finally, Loeb et al. (2007) find that entry into non-parental center based care before the age of one can lead to
problem behavior. Magnuson et al. (2007), Baker et al. (2008), Datta Gupta and Simonsen (2010), and the research
summarized in Belsky (2006) provide further evidence that non-parental care can have negative behavioral effects in
some contexts.

Clearly, the sum of this research yields a mixed message. From it, one could construct a
research base showing that increased maternal care at young ages alternatively has a positive or
no effect. There may be a consistent narrative that links the long and short term research, but
uncovering it would require study of the children in the long term research at younger ages, or of
the children in the short term studies at older ages.
Four specific features of our analysis enhance its relevance. First, the extension of leave
from 26 to 52 weeks is informative for the many OECD countries that currently have short (i.e.,
12-39 weeks) maternity leave entitlements (see Ray 2008). Second, the income replacement,
provided through the Canadian Employment Insurance system, is relatively modest. It is
comparable to the benefits provided in many jurisdictions including Australia and the United
Kingdom, as well as the paid leave programs in California and New Jersey.11 Third, as we
discuss below, developmental psychologists observe that some key developmental milestones are
achieved in the second 6 months of life. Finally, our primary measure of cognitive development,
the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), is the workhorse of research on the impacts of
maternal employment. Because so much research has used this same measure, we can compare
our results directly to the existing research that has been cited as a rationale for maternity leave
reforms.
Our analysis offers several interesting findings. We find that the expansion of parental
leave—and the resulting extra time mothers spent with their child in his/her first year of life—
had no positive impact on indices of children’s cognitive and behavioral development at ages 4
and 5; this despite the fact it had substantial impacts on the maternal care and non-licensed nonparental care children received in their first year, as well as how long they were breastfed. For

our behavioral indices we can rule out all but very modest improvements. For some of our
cognitive measures (PPVT) the estimated impact of the reform is small, negative and statistically
significant. These results provide precedence for the findings that maternity/parental leaves have
no long run impact on children’s cognitive achievement at much older ages.
Our finding of small negative effects on some cognitive scores leads to a discussion of
how parental leave affects not just the duration, but also the timing, of the mother’s return to
work.12 We speculate that it may be due to the fact that some ages are better than others for
abrupt changes in the parent-child relationship.
To proceed, we first describe the parental leave reform that forms the basis of our
analysis. We next provide the details of our empirical framework and the data we employ.
Following the presentation of our main estimates, we bring evidence on the exclusion restriction
that underlies our empirical framework and empirically address the impact of some potential
confounding factors. The paper closes with a discussion of our findings within the context of the
duration and timing of parental leave, and a brief conclusion.

The Reform
Our analysis is based on a reform of Canadian maternity/parental leave (henceforth
maternity leave) laws at the end of 2000.13 Job-protected, uncompensated, maternity leave is
provided by provincial labor standards laws, and historically there has been some variation in its

Several papers look at the impact of timing of the return to work. (See Baydar and Brooks-Gunn (1991); Han et al.
(2001); Brooks-Gunn et al. (2002); Baum (2003); Berger et al. (2005). Lucas-Thompson et al. (2010) provide a
review of studies tracking the timing of return to work.) The novelty we present is interpreting our results of the
impact of parental leave through how it might change the timing of the return to work.

duration across provinces. In contrast, income replacement during the leave is provided through
the federal Employment Insurance (EI) system and there is one standard for the country.
Before December 31, 2000, the duration of income replacement in the EI system was 25
weeks, subject to a 2 week waiting period in which no benefits are received. This comprised a 15
week leave reserved for the mother and a 10 week leave that could be shared between the
parents. For children born December 31, 2000 and onwards, the shared 10 week component of
the leave was expanded to 35 weeks, bringing total available leave to 50 weeks.14
The legislation enacting the changes was introduced to Parliament on April 7, 2000, and
received Royal Assent on June 29, 2000. Over the next six months most provinces announced
increases in the duration of job-protected leave to 52+ weeks to commence coincidently with the
change in the EI law.15 In many instances the change was not announced or enacted until
November or December 2000.16 By June 2001, all provinces offered job protection of sufficient
duration to accommodate the new 50 week EI standard.17 The change by province is presented in
table 1. While there is some slight variation across provinces, the impact of the reform is mostly
time series variation before and after 2000/2001.
Only mothers with sufficient attachment (600 hours over the last year) to the labor force
at the time of application for leave are eligible. Survey evidence (Statistics Canada 2006) for the
2000 to 2005 period suggests that between 70 and 75 percent of mothers with a child age 0 had
Historically, mothers have taken the vast majority of the leave, although this is (slowly) changing in recent years.
Marshall (2008) reports that in 2006, 23 percent of eligible fathers took some parental leave. This average reflects
incidence of 56 percent in Quebec (where there is dedicated leave for fathers) and 11 percent in the rest the country.
As documented below, observations from Quebec are deleted from our analysis sample.
15
The changes in provincial mandates were from 29-35 weeks to 52-54 weeks with the exceptions of Alberta, where
the change was from 18 weeks to 52 weeks, and Quebec, where the entitlement did not change from a level of 70
weeks.
16
For example, as late as October 2000 Ontario did not appear on track to make the change but did eventually in
December due to public outcry.
17
Two provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta, did not change their job protected leave standards until 2001.
Unfortunately there are not sufficient observations from these provinces over the 2-6 months of delay to take
advantage of this feature of the reform.

insured employment before childbirth. Of these, between 80 and 85 percent make a claim. These
percentages show a slight increase from 2000 to 2005 that suggests only a small change in the
composition of mothers who take leave before and after the reform (see also Baker and Milligan
2008a).

The Data
The National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth (NLSCY) is a nationally
representative survey of Canada’s children. The data we use are based on a longitudinal survey
of successive birth cohorts of children up to age 5. The survey is conducted in biennial cycles, so
cohorts are interviewed at ages <1, 2, 4 or ages 1, 3, 5. To account for sample attrition, a new
top-up sample is added in each cycle to ensure each cycle provides a representative sample of
children aged 0-5. There are approximately 2,000 children of each age in each cycle. The
2008/09 data are the final cycle of the survey.
The survey offers three measures of the cognitive development of children aged 4-5.
Each of these measures comes from an existing validated model and is comparable to measures
used in other studies. The first measure is the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-revised (PPVTR), which has been used extensively in previous studies of child development and is well known
in the literature. The second is the Number Knowledge Test, which was developed by a team led
by Robbie Case at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (Case et al. 1996). The test
consists of 30 questions that are used to rank children on a four point scale.18 It assesses
children’s understanding of the system of whole numbers, probing their ability to count by rote,
quantify small sets of objects, their knowledge of number sequence and their ability to solve
The scale is: 0—the child has not reached the predimensional level, 1—the child has reached the predimensional
level (4 year old equivalent), 2—the child has reached the unidimensional level (6 year old equivalent) and 3—the
child has reached the bidimensional level (8 year old equivalent).

simple arithmetic problems. The questions and answers are delivered orally, and no aids (e.g.,
pencil and paper) are allowed. Unfortunately the raw and standardized scores on the 30 questions
are only available for later cycles of the NLSCY. The third is the “Who am I?” measure, a test
developed by a team led by Molly de Lemos at the Australian Council for Educational Research
(de Lemos and Doig, 1999). It consists of copying and writing tasks that help reveal children’s
understanding and use of symbols. The copying exercises are intended to assess abilities in
geometry and the writing tasks are intended to investigate knowledge of the use of numbers,
letters and words. The test consists of 10 questions that are each awarded scores between 1 and
4. The overall or total score on the instrument is simply the sum of the scores on the individual
questions and therefore ranges in principle between 10 and 40.
We also investigate a number of non-cognitive/behavioral indices. These indices are
parent-reported measures based on best practices in the literature.19 These indicies measure
hyperactivity, anxiety, physical aggression and indirect aggression. Each index is built up from a
series of questions about the children’s reactions to other people and different situations. For
each index a higher score implies more problematic behavior. Parent-reported indices are not
without their critics. The online appendix to Baker et al. (2008) provides a detailed discussion of
these measures.
We select children aged 4 and 5 born in the years 1997-2004. These birth years bracket the
changes to the maternity leave laws, yielding four pre-reform cohorts and four post-reform

The measures are based on questions drawn from the Ontario Child Health Study, the Montreal Longitudinal
Survey, and the Child Behavior Checklist of T. M. Achenbach. The Ontario Child Health Survey questions are
based on items in the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach and Edelbrock 1983), modified so that that the
symptoms canvassed correspond to the classification of psychiatric disorders in DSM-III-R (the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association) (Boyle et al. 1993). The questions
in the Montreal Longitudinal Survey are based on the Social Behavior Questionnaire. This includes 28 items from
the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire (Behar and Stringfield 1974; Tremblay et al. 1992), an adaptation of the
Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (Rutter 1967) and the Prosocial Behavior Questionnaire (Weir, Stevenson, and
Graham 1980; Weir and Duveen 1981).

cohorts. Our objective here is to choose cohorts that are temporally adjacent to the reform to
control as much as possible for unobserved time effects. Each birth cohort is surveyed three
times between the ages of 0 and 5.20 Because the survey is conducted biennially, this means
children from adjacent birth cohorts are of different ages in their first, second and third surveys.
For example, the children of the 2000 birth cohort are surveyed at ages <1, 2 and 4, while the
children of the 2001 birth cohort are surveyed at ages 1, 3 and 5.
We omit all observations from Quebec, to account for the fact this province’s universal,
low fee child care program was extended to children under the age of two in the fall of 2000, and
so its effect might be easily confused with the effects of change in maternity leave laws. We also
omit children who live in single parent households because concurrent changes in Canada’s
system of child tax benefits, which disproportionately benefited these families, might confound
the inference.21 Therefore, our results are for children in two parent/adult households, who are
the majority beneficiaries of universal maternity leave policies.22 Our sample includes both
mothers who were eligible for the leave and those who might not be eligible. Eligibility depends
on the number of hours worked in the 12 months before a claim is made, and we do not observe
this information in our dataset.
An overview of our developmental measures for our sample is provided in table 2. We
present the sample means for each measure as well as the means for the pre- and post-reform
children. For each of the cognitive measures there is a decrease in the index with the reform of
between 6 (PPVT) and 13 (Who Am I?) percent of a standard deviation. For the behavioral
To keep the sample representative in a given survey, a top up sample is added to replace lost sample members of
the longitudinal sample.
21
The proportion of children age 0-5 living with two parents in 2000 in the Labour Force Survey is 92.2%. Singleparenthood is much less prevalent in Canada than the United States.
22
Alberta and Saskatchewan did not change their maternity leave provisions to match the change in the federal EI
rules until after December 2000. We therefore also exclude the very small number of children born in Alberta and
Saskatchewan in the months between December 2000 and the point when the provincial maternity leave mandate
changed a few months later.

measures, in the reform period there is a decrease in both aggression indices and an increase in
anxiety and hyperactivity. For these measures the changes are generally smaller—4-6 percent of
a standard deviation.
We also use data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for the analysis of our exclusion
restrictions presented after the main results. The primary purpose of this monthly survey is to
collect information on the labor force status of Canadians. We make use of the data on labor
force status, as well as questions on reasons for not actively seeking work, weekly and hourly
earnings and family structure. We again exclude observations from the province of Quebec and
from single-parent households.
Age in years is recorded in the LFS, but exact date of birth is not available. Also, single
year age categories are available for ages 0, 3, 4 and 5, but not for ages 1 and 2. Our methods for
identifying birth year for the analysis of the LFS are reported in the Appendix.

Empirical Framework
We want to estimate the impact of maternal time on children’s developmental outcomes.
To fix ideas, consider the empirical model
𝐷𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑇𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖 ,
where 𝐷𝑖 is the developmental outcome, 𝑇𝑖 is the period that the mother provides care after birth
and 𝑢𝑖 is unobserved determinants of the outcome. As has been noted in many previous papers,
OLS estimation of this equation is unlikely to retrieve the causal effect of mother’s time on
development because 𝐸[𝑇𝑖 𝑢𝑖 ] ≠ 0. For example, mothers who return to work early (low values
of 𝑇𝑖 ) may have unobserved characteristics that lead their children to have better or worse
developmental outcomes. We therefore need to find exogenous variation in 𝑇𝑖 to obtain unbiased

12

estimates of 𝛽.
Our approach is to use the variation in time at home induced by the maternity leave reform
in an instrumental variables framework. Our first stage equation is
(1) 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 = 𝑋𝑖 𝜙 + 𝑍𝑖 𝛿 + 𝑣𝑖 ,
where 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 , the number of months the mother is home with her child in the first year of life, now
replaces 𝑇𝑖 as a measure of maternal care,23 X are control variables and Z is the instrument based
on the reform of the maternity leave system.
We have two candidates for Z: 1) a dummy variable indicating that the child was born after
the change in maternity leave provisions came into effect (i.e., December 31, 2000), and 2) the
number of weeks of job protected maternity leave mandated by a province’s labor standards law
when the child was born, as reported in table 1. Relative to the first instrument, the instrument
based on weeks of mandated leave potentially exploits inter-provincial differences in pre reform
maternity leave provisions. However, if the EI entitlement was greater than the local jobprotection mandate, it is possible the mandates were not well-enforced or followed. Moreover,
the R-squared from a regression of the provincial leave mandates on year effects is 0.88; and the
addition of province effects raises the R-squared to 0.95. This suggests that our first instrument
captures most of the variation in the second. For this reason, in addition to the above-noted issues
with the observance of provincial statutes, we therefore rely primarily on the first instrument in
the analysis.
Our second stage equation is
(2) 𝐷𝑖 = 𝑋𝑖 𝜆 + 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 𝜑 + 𝜀𝑖 .
Our specification of X is partly directed by any residual concerns about omitted variables in the
The substitution of 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 for Ti provides a neat solution for observations with censored values of Ti by limiting the
time frame to one year. For example, for children surveyed at older ages, the observation of Ti may be censored
because the mother is still at home at the date of the survey.

estimation of (2). In particular, the variation in our primary instrument is perfectly correlated
with time. Therefore, it is important to control for any secular trends in the developmental
outcomes across birth cohorts that might contaminate the estimates. Our main strategy to address
this concern is to use polynomials in time defined at the quarter of birth level. Children born over
the eight birth cohorts in our sample (1997-2004) span 32 quarters. We also experiment with
other specifications of these time effects and present graphs of the variation in key variables. The
other control variables are dummy variables for male children, month of birth, single month of
child’s age at the survey date, a dummy variable for whether the child is bilingual, dummies for
the number of older and younger children, province, city size, and the following characteristics
of mothers’ and fathers’: education (4 categories), age (single year), and place of birth (19
countries).24
Note that some additional potential sources of bias are directly addressed by our choice of
sample. We omit observations from Quebec and for single parent households due to changes in
other policies that might affect developmental outcomes and be picked up by our instruments.
One assumption—the exclusion restriction—of our instrumental variables strategy is that
the reform of the leave provisions affects child outcomes only through the resulting change in
mothers’ time at home post birth. At least two dimensions of this assumption deserve comment.
First, the exclusion restriction means that any other maternal input (such as breastfeeding—see
Baker and Milligan 2008a) that may change because of the extra time at home will be picked up
by 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 . That is, 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 will reflect not just the direct effect of extra maternal time, but also any
‘downstream’ impacts of the extra maternal time on other inputs. In this sense, care must be

The regressions for age standardized PPVT scores omit the month of birth and single month of child’s age. The
results including these controls are reported in footnotes below. We control for place of birth to account for any
differences in immigration patterns. Over this time period, however, there were no strong shifts in the class or source
of immigration to Canada.

taken in interpreting the coefficients on 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 . Second, we clearly assume the reform had no
impact on child development by some other conduit. Our direct evidence of the impact of the
reform on other developmental inputs, reported below, provides support for this position.
The other important assumption for our IV strategy is monotonicity—that the instrument
has a monotonic effect on mothers’ time at home. While in theory it is possible that an increase
in parental lead entitlement could lead some mothers to take longer leaves and others to take
shorter leaves (Klerman and Leibowitz 1997), empirically the latter effect is not important for
the reform we examine (Baker and Milligan 2010). Furthermore, in the current context, theory
predicts that mothers taking shorter leaves due to the leave reform would, pre reform, have taken
leaves in excess of one year. Therefore any negative impact of the leave reform on mothers’
leave would be in the interval > 12 months. Our empirical strategy focuses on the increase in
leave taking due to the reform in the interval 0 through 12 months.
A visual depiction of our identification strategy is provided in figures 1 and 2. Here we
graph the variation in our measure of maternal care, 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 , and our most well-known outcome,
PPVT, across the reform.25 More specifically we graph estimates of year of birth effects from a
regression of 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 or PPVT on our demographic controls, year of birth effects and no constant.26
The cohorts 2001-2004 are exposed to the new regime. Therefore, these figures provide a view
of the variation identifying our first stage and the reduced form.
In figure 1 there is clear evidence that the reform increased the amount of time mothers’
were at home in the first year. A regression of the year of birth effects on a constant and a
dummy variable for the reform reveals the pre/post reform increase is 2.218 (0.168) months.
Evidence in Baker and Milligan (2008a) indicates between 65 and 75 percent of women were

eligible for the leave over this period, leading to the estimated impact for treated women of
between ((1/0.75)*2.218) 2.96 and ((1/0.65)*2.218) 3.41 months.
We relate this increase in 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 to any corresponding change in our development
indicators. In figure 2 we can clearly see there is no evidence of a corresponding improvement in
PPVT scores. In fact, it appears that these scores are marginally lower after the new leave
provisions. The estimate here of the pre/post reform change is -1.511 (0.206) points.
Given the time series variation available to us, it might seem natural to implement a
regression discontinuity (RD) design. We do not take this approach for a number of reasons.
First, the sampling design of the NLSCY prevents a straightforward application of the RD
identification strategy to our problem. As noted above, in the NLSCY children of adjacent
cohorts are of different ages in their first, second and third interviews. More specifically, the
children of the last pre-reform cohort (2000) were age 4 when our developmental indicators were
recorded, while the children of the first post reform cohort (2001) were age 5. Therefore a strict
regression discontinuity estimator would rely on the age standardization of the developmental
scores being correct. Rather than relying on this being true, we sample multiple cohorts
symmetrically before and after the reform so that any age effects average out.27 Second, and
related, the sample sizes in the NLSCY, while large for a children’s survey, are relatively modest
compared to the European administrative registers that are the basis of much of the RD evidence
on the long run effects parental leaves. Specifically, the samples in the months directly before
and after the reform are small, so our strategy also allows us to bring sufficient sample sizes to
the estimation. Third, the evaluation of early childhood programs using a strict RD design, which
compares children born months or even days apart, leans very heavily on the assumption that
For example, using the 1999 and 2000 births pre reform and the 2001 and 2002 cohorts post reform ensures that
the development measures for all children in both the pre and post reform samples were recorded at age 4 or 5.
27

16

program impacts are not offset by the remedial actions of schools and parents. However, in a
group of children born in such close temporal proximity, comparisons of pre- and post-reform
children could be easily made and would be an obvious reference point for parents and teachers
attempting to discover the developmental progress of a child. Parents appear to use other
children and their parents as reference points to evaluate the development of their own children
(e.g., Glascoe and MacLean 1990). Also, in clinical application parents’ evaluations are found to
be more useful when they are asked to compare their child to other children (Deimann and
Kastner-Koller 2011 and references therein). While our approach is not completely free of these
concerns, by sampling multiple cohorts before and after the reform the impact of any such
remedial action is diluted relative to its impact in a strict RD design. Furthermore, we observe
the children before the remedial opportunities in formal schooling are made available. Finally,
we carefully document any differences in developmental inputs provided to pre- and post-reform
children at ages 0 through 5 years.

Two-Stage Least-Squares estimates of the impact of Mother’s Care on Developmental
Outcomes at Age 4 and 5
We now present our main results. First are our Two-Stage Least-Squares (TSLS)
estimates, and a demonstration of how they vary with different specifications of the time effects
and in different samples. Next, we gather evidence on the exclusion restriction that assumes time
at home is the channel through which maternity leave has its impact. Finally, we examine how
our results vary with and without controls and investigate the influence of the control variables
on our analysis.

17

In table 3 are our main TSLS estimates of the impact of maternal care from the sample of
birth cohorts 1997 through 2004. In column 1 are the results using the dummy variable for
treatment as the instrument and conditioning on the demographic controls and the quartic in time
measured at the quarter of birth level. The corresponding estimates for the instrument from the
first stage are reported in the preceding column. The instrument is very significant in each first
stage regression.
The estimate for PPVT is negative and statistically significant at the 10 percent level. It
indicates a one month increase in maternal care over the range we study leads to a decrease in
this score of 4.8 percent of a standard deviation.28 Recall that in the discussion of figures 1 and 2
we report estimates of both a first stage and a reduced form for the pre/post variation in the year
of birth effects for 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 and PPVT based on our treatment dummy variable. They are 2.218
months and -1.511 points respectively. The ratio of this reduced form to the first stage is -0.681,
not far off the point estimate of -0.739 in table 3 that is obtained using a different specification of
the time effects. Also, the estimate of the first stage matches well with the estimate in table 3.
The result for Who Am I? is also negative and statistically significant at the 10 percent level. It
indicates a one month increase in maternal care leads to a decrease of 4.7 percent of a standard
deviation. Finally, the estimate for Know Your Numbers is positive, again statistically significant
at the 10 percent level, and indicates an increase in this score of 5.2 percent of the standard
deviation.
The estimates for the behavioral measures are uniformly small and statistically
insignificant. In each case the estimated standard error is 2.9 percent or less of the standard
deviation of the corresponding measure. This suggests the power to detect changes in the
Adding controls for the child’s age and month of birth the estimate is -0.415 (0.486). As we report below

28

18

indicators of at least 5.7 percent of a standard deviation at the 5 percent level. Therefore, any
improvement in behavior undetected by our empirical strategy would by implication be quite
small.
In columns 2 through 4 we experiment with the control for time effects, by specifying, in
turn, a cubic in time, a linear trend in time specified separately for the pre and post reform time
periods, and a quadratic in time specified separately for the pre and post reform time periods.29
The point estimates for PPVT are robust to these innovations although for the pre/post reform
quadratic specification the standard errors are much larger. There is more sensitivity for both the
point estimates and the statistical significance the other two cognitive measures. Finally the
behavioral measures vary in sign and magnitude across specifications, but almost all the
estimates are statistically insignificant.
In column 5 we use our second instrument, weeks of mandated job protected leave, which
varies at the provincial level. In the preceding column are the estimates for this instrument from
the first stage. As explained above, this instrument exploits variation in the change in leave
mandate by province (see table 1). The estimated impacts for PPVT and Who Am I? are now
larger, but so are their standard errors. The estimate for Know Your Numbers is now negative,
but very small. The results for the behavioral measures are in general quite different than their
counterparts in column 1 although all remain statistically insignificant.
Overall the estimates for PPVT in table 3 display a good amount of stability across the
specifications. The estimates for Who Am I? display a bit more sensitivity, although none is
positive. The estimates for the other measures vary more significantly across columns, which

The second stage collapses when we specify a quintic in time. The model is not identified when we use quarter of
birth dummy variables since they perfectly predict the instrument.

might be expected given their relatively larger standard errors and lack of statistical
significance.30
We next examine estimates from a tighter sample around the reform using children born
in 1999 through 2002. These estimates are potentially less affected by any secular differences
between pre and post reform cohorts, but this benefit comes at the cost of a reduction in sample
size of about one-half. The results are reported in table 4. The estimates for PPVT are very
similar to the estimates in the previous table and all statistically significant at the 5 percent level.
The estimates for both Know Your Numbers and Who Am I? are now of opposite sign of the
results in table 3, but in both cases the standard errors are much bigger. For the behavioral
measures the standard errors are again much larger and while the point estimates don’t always
match their counterparts in table 3 are statistically significant. The exception to this conclusion is
the results for Hyperactivity, which are negative now statistically significant at the 10 percent
level in some specifications.
To try to shed more light on the meaning of the statically significant impacts on some of
the cognitive scores in table 3, in table 5 we report estimates separately by sex. It is clear that the
negative impact on PPVT is experienced exclusively by boys, while any positive impact on
Know Your Numbers is experienced by girls.31
Considering the sum of evidence in tables 3-5, the estimates for most outcomes are
largely statistically insignificant, typically small, and show some sensitivity to the specifications
of the control for time and of the instrument. The exception to this conclusion is the results for
PPVT which are more robust, typically statistically significant and consistently negative.
The number of observations varies across the different outcomes. Restricting the sample to children with valid
observations on all outcomes leads to similar estimates.
31
Controlling for child’s age and month of birth the estimate for males is -1.443 (0.743) and for females, 0.953
(0.672).
30

20

Testing for other channels of impact
A strength of our study is that we can assess the identifying assumption that no other
changes in developmental inputs are correlated with our instrument. Bernal and Keane (2011)
note that few empirical investigations of the relationship of current developmental outcomes to
past environments consider the cumulative impact of past developmental inputs. This is likely
because measures of past inputs are not available in most data sets.
In this section, we test the validity of our exclusion restriction by investigating
differences in developmental inputs between pre and post reform birth cohorts in the years
intervening the first year and the age at which our developmental outcomes are measured. We
argue that this is a key step to connect the leave reform to the cognitive and non-cognitive
outcomes at ages 4 and 5. As noted in the Introduction, any relationship between leave reforms
and later life outcomes may be accentuated or offset by the remedial actions of parents and
schools. These actions might be expected if due to the timing of the reform, pre and post reform
children were in the same or adjacent grades. Note it is precisely this group of children that are
most “informative” in regression discontinuity analyses of leave reforms.
In Baker and Milligan (2010), the care arrangements of children at ages 13-24 months
were found to be little changed for the cohorts born after 2000, even though their care
arrangements up to 12 months were sharply different than for earlier cohorts with less access to
leave. Here, we follow up and extend that analysis to study the income and labor supply patterns
in the time following the first year of life.
To proceed we use both the NLSCY and the LFS. Because we do not observe 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 in the
LFS, we cannot use our instrumental variables strategy for these data. Moreover, we cannot see
quarter of birth, so our strategy for the LFS can only exploit cross-year of birth variation. For

21

these reasons, we investigate any differences in developmental inputs across birth cohorts using a
different empirical strategy than the IV strategy we use for the analysis of cognitive and
behavioral development that follows.
For both the NLSCY and the LFS, we estimate the reduced form relationship between the
inputs and our instrument following a two-step procedure outlined in Baker and Milligan (2010).
Briefly, we regress the developmental input on demographic controls and a full set of year of
birth effects omitting the intercept. In the second step we regress the 8 estimated year of birth
effects from the first stage on an intercept and the instrument—a dummy variable that equals one
for birth cohorts exposed to the new maternity leave provisions. The estimates of the parameter
on this dummy variable reported below reveal the average difference in the dependent variable
between pre and post reform birth cohorts.
We start with the NLSCY data, investigating measures of maternal care in table 6. The
first row contains results for 𝑇𝐹𝑌𝑖 at different ages between 13 and 71 months. The samples at
different ages do not contain all the same children, so the estimated time at home in the first year
may change somewhat. However, absent some bias due to cohort attrition and the survey resampling procedures, the estimates of the increase in time at home in the first year should be
similar when measured at the different points of age. They are in fact very similar varying within
a quarter of a month. The estimated year of birth effects underlying these results are reported in
table A1 of the appendix. For each group there is a clear break in the estimates between the 2000
and 2001 birth cohorts corresponding to the reform.
In the next row are the results for a 0/1 indicator that the mother has returned to work by
the indicated age. At ages 13-24 there is a marginal but not statistically significant decrease in

22

the proportion who have returned to work. At ages 25-39 and 48-71 months the point estimates
are effectively zero and statistically insignificant.
Baker and Milligan (2010) report that the reform had little impact on the non parental
care arrangements of these children at ages 13-24 months, this despite the fact their care
arrangements up to 12 months were sharply affected. Unfortunately we are unable to extend this
analysis to ages 25-71 months due to sampling problems in the non parental care section of the
NLSCY in cycle 6 and a revamp of this section of the survey in cycles 7 and 8.32
In rows 3 and 4 of table 6 we examine the family circumstances in which the child grew
up, through the presence of older and younger siblings. There is little evidence here that the
reform had a significant effect on the spacing of births or total fertility to this point in this
sample.33 The estimates for all ages are statistically insignificant. Finally in the last row we
report the results using a self reported depression score for the mother as a dependent variable.
Chatterji and Markowitz (2005) report a positive effect of maternity leave on mothers’ maternal
health although at lower durations than the ones under study here. While the estimates for this
variable are negative—indicating lower depression—they are all statistically insignificant.
The NLSCY does not provide good information on economic outcomes contemporaneous
with the survey such as employment and income. This is in part due to the fact that the survey

Cycles 6-8 are the source of information on the non parental care of post reform children at these older ages.
These sampling issues make the comparison of these responses to the responses of pre reform cohorts from earlier
waves problematic. The issues include a computer glitch that led to missing values for one-quarter of children in
cycle 6.
33
We investigated the potential impact of differential fertility on the composition of our sample by looking at the
fraction of childless couples, the average number of children among those with children, and the fraction of those
having a child who are married. No differences in the trend after 2000/2001 was observed.
32

23

questions about these outcomes do not have a fixed reference point. 34 We therefore turn to the
LFS to investigate these and other inputs.
The results for the LFS are reported in table 7, while the underlying year of birth
estimates are reported in Table A2 of the appendix. Note that the age groupings are slightly
different than those in table 6 but span the same interval from 13 to 71 months.35 In the first 4
rows are the results for labor force status as of the survey date. While there is little evidence of
an impact of the reform on mothers’ employment, there is a statistically significant, but small
increase in the probability the employment was full time when the child was between 13 and 59
months of age. Here, full time is defined as working 30 hours per week or more. Note, however,
that there is but a faint echo of this result in the estimates for usual weekly hours of work which
are all positive, but most less than one hour per week.36 We note that this NLSCY and LFS
evidence that the increase in maternity leave had little impact on mothers’ post birth employment
is consistent with the results in Baker and Milligan (2008b) and Schonberg and Ludsteck
(forthcoming).
The next rows contain the results for real earnings. The results for ages 13-35 months and
36-47 months are after the period of paid leave has ended, but prior to the measurement of
developmental indicators. At these ages there is evidence of an increase in family real earnings
of around $60 per week, although not in mothers’ real earnings or wages. At ages concurrent
with the testing there is evidence of an increase in both mothers’ and families’ real earnings.

In the case of income, the survey respondent (the person most knowledgeable about the child) supplies
information for each member of the family. The reference period for the report is the previous 12 months, which is
not a calendar year and varies across respondents depending on which month of the year they are interviewed.
35
As noted earlier, the year of birth is not directly reported in the LFS. Instead, we identify the year of birth for
children by selecting a sample of children in December of each year. The regressions also include controls for
province, urban/rural residence, mother’s and spouse’s age and education.
36
The result for age 36-47 months does echo the larger point estimate for hours for the 25-39 months age group in
the NLSCY data
34

24

We create real earnings by converting the earnings reports to 2002 dollars using the
Consumer Price Index. In the presence of a general upward trend in wages across years, our
estimates here based on just the time series variation will attribute to the policy what is really just
a trend in real wage growth. For this reason, we have also re-estimated these regressions
deflating earnings by the growth in the Industrial Aggregate Wage from Statistics Canada’s
Survey of Employment Payrolls and Hours (catalogue 72-002-XIB). As can be seen in Appendix
table A3, using these wage-growth adjusted earnings tells a somewhat different story. They
indicate a smaller (by half) increase in family earnings at ages 13-35 months, and little increase
at older ages.
If the Consumer Price Index-adjusted results are to be given greater weight there is
evidence of a modest increase in family resources for the post reform birth cohorts concurrent
with the measurement of the developmental indices that we study. We might expect this
difference in family resources to lend a small positive developmental advantage to the post
reform cohorts. This would attenuate the negative impact on PPVT we observe in figure 2.
However, if instead the wage adjusted results are more informative, there is little earnings
advantage for the post reform cohorts.
In the next 5 rows of table 7 are measures of maternal care that are available in the
LFS.37 First up are indicators that the mothers of these children work part-time, are not available
for work or not looking for work because they are caring for their own children. We see little
evidence here of systematic and significant differences in how the children were cared for at ages
13 through 71 months.
Next are variables that capture whether the mother has been without work since the child
was born. To construct these variables we compare the year the mother last worked to the child’s
37

The LFS does not provide any direct information on whether the child is in non-parental care.

25

year of birth. For the “year before birth” (YBB) variable we code the mother as not working
since giving birth if the date of last employment is the year before the year of birth. For the “year
of birth” (YOB) measure we code the mother as not working since giving birth if the date of last
employment is the same as the year of birth. Using the YBB method we miss some mothers who
have in fact stayed at home since their child’s birth. Using the YOB method we code some
mothers as having stayed at home, who might have instead returned to work for a short period
post birth. That said, the two methods lead to very similar conclusions. There is a very modest
increase in staying at home at ages 13-35, and no evidence of an impact of the reform at older
ages. Note the estimates for ages 13-35 are of similar magnitude to, but opposite sign of, the
estimates for the probability the mother has returned to work for this age group in the NLSCY
(table 6).
Finally, in the last two rows we look for changes in family structure through the presence
of younger or older siblings. Echoing the results from the NLSCY, there is no evidence here of
an impact of the reform on the fertility decisions of mothers in our sample.
The results in table 6 and 7 tell largely the same story. There is little systematic evidence
in either the NLSCY or LFS data of differences in observable inputs to child development
between the pre- and post-reform birth cohorts at ages 1 through 5. This is consistent with our
exclusion restriction: the leave reform had concurrent effects on the amount of maternal care
children received at ages 0-12 months, but did not affect other inputs across birth cohorts at older
ages. That is, our results on cognitive and behavioral measures can be attributed with some
confidence directly to the increase in maternal care in the first year of life and are not observably
contaminated by changes in other inputs after 12 months.

26

Robustness Analysis: Trends in Observable Characteristics
By varying the specification of the control for time and also the sample, we investigate
whether our results are sensitive to how we account for unobserved differences between the pre
and post reform cohorts. In this section we examine any changes in observable characteristics
between the pre and post reform cohorts. As noted above, tables 6 and 7 show there are few
differences in the observable developmental inputs provided to the children between ages 1 and
5. We now focus on changes in the characteristics of their parents and households.
To start the analysis, in column (1) of table 8 we report the results when we omit all the
control variables from the regressions except those for the child’s age. Beginning with the
cognitive measures, each estimate is negative and statistically significant. The estimate for PPVT
is just over half the size of many of the estimates in table 3. The result for Know Your Numbers
contrasts with mostly positive estimates in table 3. For the behavioral outcomes there are now
negative and statistically significant estimates for aggression and indirect aggression. The results
for anxiety and hyperactivity are both a bit bigger than estimates from table 3 but statistically
insignificant.
Focusing on the result for PPVT, the difference between the conditional and
unconditional estimates suggest there is some observable characteristic of the children’s families
that is 1) correlated with the reform, and 2) correlated with the outcome variables (e.g.,
positively correlated with PPVT). To investigate we run OLS regressions of each of the
demographic characteristics on dummy variables for year of birth. The results indicate that there
are changes in mothers’ and fathers’ education that appear correlated with the reform. The
estimated year of birth effects for the proportions of mothers and fathers with a high school
diploma and a university degree are reported in table 9. The results indicate a reduction of the

27

proportion of mothers with a high school diploma, and a corresponding increase in the
proportion with a university degree of roughly 8 percentage points with the 2001 birth cohort.
Corresponding but smaller changes in the educational attainment of fathers are also apparent.
One survey issue complicating the interpretation of these results is changes in the
questions about education. First in cycle 5 a new open ended category “other education or
training” was added to the question about post secondary attainment. Second in cycle 7 the
number of categories recording educational attainment was increased. Also, for the first time
parents of children who were being followed longitudinally were invited to update their
educational attainment. In cycle 5 are the initial interviews of the last pre reform (2000) and first
post reform (2001) birth cohorts, while Cycle 7 is the survey in which the developmental results
(e.g., PPVT scores) for the first post reform cohorts are observable (birth cohorts 2001 and
2002), so there are changes in the survey questions about educational attainment correlated with
the reform.
To gain an independent perspective on this issue we examine data from the LFS on the
educational attainment of the mothers of different birth cohorts. There are no changes in the
education questions in the LFS over this period. The results are reported in figures 3 and 4. In
figure 3 we show the proportion of females by year with a university degree from three groups:
1) married/partnered mothers with a child less than 1 years old, 2) married/partnered mothers
with a child aged 1-5, and 3) women of child bearing age (ages 15-45). The first group isolates
mothers with a new born allowing us to examine differences among mothers giving birth across
the reform. Two points are clear. First there is a strong upward secular trend in the proportion of
females and mothers with post-secondary degrees over the period. Second, there is no obvious
jump in mothers’ educational attainment starting in 2001 after the reform is in place. If anything

28

there is a jump in the last pre reform year (2000), but the increase is not out of line with similar
variation seen in, for example, 1994, 1997 and 2006. Corresponding time series for the
proportion of females with a high school degree are reported in figure 4. Again while there is a
clear secular trend in these data, there is no evidence of an impact of the reform.
In table 10 are regression results from the LFS corresponding to the table 9 results from
the NLSCY. Here we use the sample of parents of children aged 4-5, the ages at which our
developmental indicators are measured, to match our sample from the NLSCY. First there is no
evidence of significant changes in the education of fathers by the child’s birth cohort. Second,
while there is no evidence of shifts in the proportion of mothers with a high school diploma by
birth cohort, there is evidence of an increase in the proportion of mothers with a university
degree starting with birth cohort 2002, one year after the reform. The increase is roughly half of
the increase in the NLSCY data.
We interpret these LFS results as suggesting that the story told in table 9 is partly the
result of the changes in the educational questions in the NLSCY, or some other sample issue.38
Mechanically the changes in parental education in the NLSCY do account for the differences in
the conditional and unconditional estimates for PPVT. This can be seen in the second column of
table 8 where we report estimates simply adding mothers’ and fathers’ education as control
variables. This brings the estimate for PPVT in line with the previous results. Note also the
estimated decreases in Know Your Numbers and Who Am I? scores are marginally larger
relative to the unconditional counterparts. The decrease in these scores is larger once we account
for the recorded increase in the education of the parents.
Another change in the survey in cycle 7 is that children being followed longitudinally were interviewed even if
they had not responded in all previous cycles. In previous cycles children followed longitudinally were interviewed
in a current wave only if they had responded in all previous waves. As noted above there is a top up sample in each
cycle to account for any longitudinal attrition in the birth cohorts. In any event omitting these observations from the
sample does not materially affect the results.
38

29

What accounts for the difference in the conditional and unconditional estimates for Know
Your Numbers and the behavioral measures? The answer is in table 8, column 3. Here we add a
very simple control for any secular trends in the data: a linear trend. With the notable exceptions
of PPVT and Who Am I?, the estimates for most of the other outcomes switch signs and/or lose
statistical significance with this change in specification. Exceptions are indirect aggression and
hyperactivity—in these cases the estimates start to converge to the estimates in table 3 when
higher order terms in time are specified (i.e., a cubic). This implies that the statistically
significant estimates for these outcomes in column 1 of table 8 cannot be distinguished from a
simple trend in the data. More generally the estimates for these outcomes are sensitive to the
specification of controls for secular trends. However, this is not the case for PPVT and to a lesser
extent for Who Am I?.
We recognize that the changes in parental education over time documented in the LFS
potentially put post reform children at an advantage developmentally, all else equal, to their pre
reform cohorts. This would present a stronger challenge to our inferences if we had found that
the maternity leave reform had resulted in an increase in the developmental scores. We would
not know what part of the effect was due to the reform and what part was due to the increasing
education of the parents. As it is, however, we find no impact on some of our measures and small
negative impacts on others.
Figures 3 and 4 tell us that a secular trend in mothers’ education over the period in which
the reform was implemented might affect our estimates. The trend appears to be stronger in the
recorded education variables of the NLSCY. It seems likely that this is in part due to the changes
in NLSCY education questions correlated with the reform. Therefore, once we use the NLSCY
education variables as control variables if there is a bias it would be negative—that is our

30

conditional estimates provide upper bound estimates of a negative impact of the reform on PPVT
and Who Am I? scores. However, given the unconditional estimates for PPVT and Who Am I?
are negative and statistically significant, we can rule out any positive impact of the reform on
these cognitive measures.

Discussion
The results presented in table 3 provide little evidence that the Canadian maternity leave
reforms had a measurable positive impact on the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of children
at ages 4 and 5. Together with the evidence of Baker and Milligan (2010), the results indicate
that the Canadian reform led to little improvement in a wide variety of measures of young
children’s development and well-being at ages 0 through 5 years. We believe this is a significant
conclusion. First, as noted in the introduction, a positive impact is assumed in legislation
enacting maternity leave in many developed countries. Second, the reforms did have a
substantial impact on the maternal care children receive in their first year of life, with consequent
impacts on inputs thought significant to development such as full time maternal employment,
non-licensed non-parental care, breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding duration. Third, these
findings provide precedence for the evidence that there is no impact of maternity leave on
cognitive outcomes measured at older ages (Dustmann and Schonberg 2012, Liu and Skans
2009, Rasmussen 2010). Finally, the stated target of maternity leave policies is often the
developmental outcomes of children at ages just prior to school entry. It is precisely at these ages
that we find no positive effect.
The point estimates for some of our measures of behavioral development, while
statistically insignificant, are sometimes in the expected direction—better behavior. However, in

31

general the results for these outcomes are quite unstable across changes in sample and
specification. Also, the standard errors are small enough to rule out changes in these outcomes of
more than 5½ percent of a standard deviation, so any improvement in behavior is by implication
small.
While our results are consistent with analyses of the impacts of this Canadian reform at
younger ages, and more generally with studies of the impact of maternity leave reforms on long
run outcomes, they do contrast with the results of the cited literature on the impact of maternal
employment on child outcomes. One possible account of this disagreement is the different
identification strategies used in these two literatures. Most of the direct evidence of the impact of
maternity leave is based on policy reforms, which are arguably exogenous to unobserved
determinants of child outcomes. Studies of the impact of maternal employment on child
outcomes more commonly attempt to account for the possible endogeneity of maternal
employment by controlling for an extensive array of observable characteristics.
We also note that the reform we examine not only increased the duration of leave but also
reduced the minimum employment needed for benefit entitlement from 700 hours to 600 hours in
the 12 months preceding the claim. This change was made in response to advocacy claiming that
given the typical spacing of births, many women were unable to work enough after giving birth
to establish entitlement for a subsequent birth. It is possible that the women newly entitled under
this part of the reform are so selected from the population to generate a bias to our estimates.
Unfortunately the NLSCY does not have sufficient information on the pre birth employment of
mothers to pursue this hypothesis.
The results for PPVT and Who Am I? are not of the expected sign and are statistically
significant. In interpreting these negative impacts it is important to note that they are small. In

32

the conditional results the impact on PPVT is 4.8 percent of a standard deviation, while the
impact on Who Am I? is 4.7 percent of a standard deviation. Given the previous discussion of
the recording of parental education in the NLSCY, these estimates are likely to be upper bounds.
We argue that the relative impacts by sex add credibility to the inference. PPVT captures
skills in vocabulary, a precursor to reading. As reported by Fryer and Levitt (2010), males
persistently score lower in reading tests in the primary years, as early as at fall enrollment in
kindergarten. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that for these skills it is males who suffer the
greater consequence to an “upset” to developmental progress in the early years.
A remaining question is why an increase in maternal care could have a negative, albeit
small, impact on cognition. One possibility is the post-reform increase in maternal care the
children experienced at ages 0-12 months. It is certainly true that some observational studies find
early childhood education, for which maternal care is often a substitute, has positive impacts on
cognition. However, it is not obvious what sort of critical early childhood instruction is provided
to children at ages 0-12 months when in non-parental care. Another possibility is some impact of
the reform on development inputs children received after their mothers’ returned to work.
However, as documented in Baker and Milligan (2010), the reform did not change the care
arrangements children were in at ages greater than 12 months. Also, the analysis in table 7
directly tests and rejects the hypothesis that there were systematic changes in a variety of other
developmental inputs. Finally, the reform we examine not only increased the duration of leave
but also reduced the minimum employment needed for benefit entitlement from 700 hours to 600
hours in the 12 months preceding the claim. This change was made in response to advocacy that
claimed that given the typical spacing of births, many women were unable to work enough to
establishment entitlement before their second, third, or subsequent birth. It is possible that the

33

women newly entitled under this part of the reform are so selected from the population to
generate the negative impact on children’s cognitive scores. Unfortunately the NLSCY does not
have sufficient information on the pre birth employment of mothers to pursue this hypothesis.
We think a potentially promising avenue starts at the widely held, but to our knowledge
not well researched, assumption that child development is monotonically increasing in the
amount of maternal care in the first year. Importantly, parental leave expansions not only change
the duration of maternal care but also the timing of the date of separation. It is possible that these
two effects push against each other at certain ages. More care may be better, but the
developmental consequences of mothers’ return to work may vary in an unrestricted way over
the first year. Simply put, that there may be better and worse times to make this transition over
the first year from a developmental perspective.
The reform we analyze increased the maternal care in the first year by about 3 months for
the treated, changing the return to work on average from just short of 6 months post birth to just
shy of 9 months. Developmental psychologists observe that some key milestones are achieved in
the second 6 months of life. Potentially important here are the development of stranger anxiety
and separation anxiety.39 Stranger anxiety, which is generally observed emerging around 6-8
months, is the tendency of the child to express distress and wariness at the approach of a
stranger. In earlier months such an approach might be met instead with a smile and curiosity.
Separation anxiety refers to a child’s distress from being separated from his/her parent or
primary caregiver. It is thought to relate to the development of object permanence—the
appreciation that objects and people continue to exist when out of sight—and emerge around the
8th month.

39

Our brief discussion of these milestones follows Scher and Harel (2009).

34

At a mother’s return to work, a child is separated from a parent and in many cases
introduced to a stranger. Relative to a return to work before 6 months, a return between 6 and 12
months places these events in precisely the interval in which a child develops anxiety about
them. More precisely, the impact of the maternity leave reform we study potentially increases the
stress a child experiences when attaching to a new non parental caregiver.
Neither the direct impact on stress indicators nor any consequences for cognitive and
behavioral development of the mechanism we investigate have, to our knowledge, been directly
investigated (see Gunnar and Quevedo 2007 for a general discussion of stress and development
in infancy). There is evidence that maternal stress transmitted to the child in utero (O’Dinnell et
al. 2009, Bergman et al. 2010) or post-natally through breast milk (Glynn et al. 2007) can
negatively impact cognitive behavioral development (see also Glover 2011 and the references
therein). Also, after the emergence of “separation protest”, entry into non parental care leads to
persistent elevation of cortisol levels (Ahnert et al. 2004). Furthermore the expression of stranger
or separation anxiety may increase parental stress that may in turn have consequences for the
child.
While the additional stress from parent/child separation at the 9th month rather than the
5th provides a potential mechanism for the small, negative cognitive effects we find, or an offset
of otherwise positive effects, the means to test this hypothesis are not available in our data. We
do observe that the maternity leave reform we analyze does not have a statistically significant
impact on our measure of anxiety at ages 4 and 5 (table 3), although this is clearly not definitive.
However, from a developmental perspective further research on this and associated issues is
clearly critical to initiatives to refine maternity and parental leave provisions in many countries.
Among other impacts, maternity leave reform typically affects the timing of mothers’ return to

35

work, and therefore of the parent/child separation, over the first year. Our reading of the
literature is that open questions remain on how child development varies with the timing of this
separation.

Conclusions
We investigate the impact of a change in Canada’s maternity leave laws on children’s
cognitive and behavioral development at ages 4 and 5. The change in the law increased the
duration of job-protected, partially-compensated leave from approximately 6 months to one year.
This led to large contemporaneous changes in important inputs to children’s development:
maternal care, maternal full time employment, unlicensed non-parental care, and breastfeeding
duration.
We find that these changes had no positive impact on indices of behavioral and cognitive
development. For our behavioral indices we can rule out all but very modest improvements. Our
estimates for the cognitive indices are small, negative, and statistically significant in two of three
cases. For example, for PPVT we estimate that a one month increase in maternal care over the
range we examine leads to a reduction of at most 5.7 percent of a standard deviation. These
findings together with those in Baker and Milligan (2010) provide a fairly comprehensive
document of how the Canadian reform had little positive impact on a wide variety of
developmental indices for children at ages 0-5 years. Follow-up study of these children at older
ages will clearly further enhance our understanding of this reform.
This said, we cannot rule out impacts on still more outcomes. For example we are unable
to investigate the impact of our reform on children’s health outcomes because Canada does not

36

have an ongoing survey of children’s health. Ruhm (2000) and Tanaka (2005) provide evidence
of a positive impact of maternity leave on child health.
Our results provide precedence for findings in the literature that maternity leave reforms
have no impact on cognitive outcomes measured at high school or later. They also highlight the
possibility that child development is not monotonically increasing in the amount of maternal care
received in the first year—there may be better and worse times for mothers to make the transition
back to work in this period. Because “more is better” appears to be the working assumption of
maternity leave laws in many countries, there is clearly a need to better understand the
developmental consequences of mothers’ return to work over the ages typically spanned by these
policies.

Appendix
Data Methods for the Labour Force Survey Sample
Age in years is recorded in the LFS, but exact date of birth is not available. By sampling
from either the December or January surveys we can identify year of birth with a relatively small
amount of error for single year categories.40 For the December sample, we assume the birthday is
in the current year. For the January sample, we assume the birthday was in the previous year.
Since the reference week for the monthly survey is the week containing the 15th day. This means
our coding will miss people born in the first half of January (for the January sample) or the last
half of December (for the December sample). Any impact of this error is attenuated by the fact
that our ultimate objective is to divide the cohorts by whether they faced the new maternity leave
regime. However, the miscoding between the 2000 and 2001 birth cohorts means that some
children will erroneously be designated as “treated” and vice versa. We report results using the
December sample, but the results are very similar using the January samples.
Single year age categories are available for ages 0, 3, 4 and 5, but not for ages 1 and 2. As
a result in the December 2000 or January 2001 surveys, those aged 2 will have been exposed to
the original leave regime while those aged 1 will have been born during the reform period. To
address this problem we do not sample from the December 2000 or January 2001 surveys for this
age group. Denoting cohorts by the birth year of the one year olds, for this age group we use four
cohorts before the reform (1997 to 2000) and three cohorts born after the reform (2002 to 2004).

40

January and December are at the trough of the seasonal birth cycle in Canada. Compared to the
U.S. the peak in monthly births in Canada occurs earlier than in the U.S., and the relative
distance between peak and trough is greater. See He and Earn (2007).
