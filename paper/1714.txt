Does Deductibility Influence
Local Taxation?

ABSTRACT

Recent proposals to reform the U.S. tax code all contain significant reforms of the cufrent provision allowing for the deductibility of
state and local taxes.

This paper examines the effect of deductibility reform on the reve-

nue decisions of the largest U.S. cities. The analysis of eight alternative
reforms concludes:

(1) total taxes change very little in the long—run,

falling at most by 13% and, for many cities, even rising slightly; (2) fees
and license revenue (predominantly a tax on firms) generally fall, in some
cases by 30% or more; (3) the net effect on total revenues (tax plus fees)

is generally small, never declininq by more than 12% even with full loss of
deductibility; and (4) policies to offset city revenue losses are effective
in neutralizing the negative effects of deductibility reform.

Does Deductibility Influence Local Taxation?

by
Robert P. Inman

For the first time since the adoption of the income tax in 1913.
the federal government is considering a major, fundamental overhaul of

the United States tax code. Members of Congress from both parties and
the Reagan Administration have offered reform proposals which greatly
simplify the present tax system, while also advancing, it can be
argued, the dual objectives of economic efficiency and tax equity.

All reform proposals contain changes in the federal tax law which may
hive important implications for the financing of state and local

governments. Foremost among these changes is the removal, fully or in
part, of the current deductibility of state and local taxes from

household income when calculating federal tax payments. There is
tentative evidence (Zimmerman. 1983; Noto and Zimmerman, 1984) to
suggest the present deductibility of state—local taxes may stimulate
the provision of state—local government services by providing a

subsidy to state—local taxation. There is more conclusive evidence
(Rock, 1984) to show that the deductibility of state—local taxes
reduces the progressivity of our overall (federal—state—local) tax
system. If we were to remove the federal deductibility of state—local
taxes we might then observe a smaller, and possibly more efficient.
state—local public sector as well as a more progressive combined tax
system.

The purpose of this research is to examine as carefully as

softening the blov to after—tax incomes or public services received
by local taxpayers.
II. Deductibility and the Local Decision to Tax
Cities budget subject to constraints. Legal

constraints

influence local finance by defining the fiscal choices available to

cities. Economic

constraints

set the limits

2

to how many dollars

can

be allocated along each dimension of choice. Political constraints
detail the process by which dollars are so allocated.

Together the

three constraints set the local budget. I will focus here on only one

aspects of the local public budget —

the revenue decision — and

effects of tightening one of the constraints —

the

the

economic

constraint — through the removal of deductibility for local taxes.
For this analysis I will assume that the level and structure of
loc•l revenues are set by a majority rule process involving two or
note coalitions of voters.

Since the budgetary process will

generally require decisions on several policy dimensions the usual

media voter model will not apply.3

Rather, city budgets will emerge

from a bargaining process among the relevant voter coalitions.

Ideally, we would like to specify and estimate a structural model of
this bargaining process, unraveling coalition preferences and the

political weights in the process. That task is beyond us here.4 We
can, however, specify a reduced—form model of local budgeting which,

subject to the usual caveats regarding structure stability, will allow
us to estimate the effects on local finance of changes in
deductibility. Is section III, I will outline one possible structural
model of local finance which helps to rationalize the observed
reduced—form estimates.

A generalized. reduced—form specification of revenue allocations
by city i in year s can be specified as:

Included in the vector

as legal constraints are local city

spending obligations for education (DED = 1 if the city has primary

responsibility for education. 0 otherwise), and welfare (ML 1, if
the city has primary responsibility for AFDC welfare, 0 otherwise) and
state prohibitions on the use of local taxes other than property
taxation (DI = 1 if city can use the income tax. 0 otherwise; DSS 1

if city can use selective sales taxes, 0 otherwise; and DGS — 1 if
city can use a general sales tax, 0 otherwise).6 In addition, states

often place restrictions on the rate of local property taxation;
either as a limit to the nominal, or •ill (tax pir *1000 of assessed
value), rate or (more recently) as a limit to the effective (or •srket

value) rate. The more coon state—imposed limit to nominal rates is
specified as the inverse of the state mill rate limit (RLIM) while the
state limit to the effective property tax rate is specified as a

4

simple 1 (if an effective rate limit applies) or 0 (if no effective
rite limit applies) dummy variable (LEVYLIM).7

The economic constraints included in

are per capita city

income after state and federal taxes but before local taxation (CINC),
federal and state aid from categorical (but

not open—ended matching)

Also included in the

Us an economic constraint will be the ability of a city to

export a portion of its local tax burden either

by taxing non—

residents or by using federal and state tax code provisions which

allow the deduction of, or credits for, local taxation. Local

tax

exportation through non—resident taxation or deductibility will in

effect lower the 5rice to residents of raising local revenues; the
direct burden of local taxes is reduced by the share of the burden
exported.

To make this notion of tax exportation precise, and

to test for the effects of deductibility on local finance, I have

As a final conent on the specification of the burden price of
local finance, we must also note that the non—resident share of

revenues includes not only revenues paid today by those in other
jursidictions but may

include

the present value of revenues paid by

future residents which go to support today's services. How do future

taxpayers subsidize current services? Two mechanisms are available:
by underfunding public employee pensions and by rolling—over short—

term debt.15 Unless local land markets or labor markets capitalize
these debts (and there is no good evidence that they do or do not),

future residents will bear a fraction of the current costs for city

services. A precise estimate of the fraction of local revenues paid
by future taxpayer's is not possible, but I do include in X. a likely

measures the arbitrage advantage of holding city dollars in interest
bearing accounts and financing today's public services through

borrowing.

As ARBINT rises, the non—debt sources of current period

revenues — taxes and fees — are
likely to decline if shifting to
future residents occurs.16
The political constraints on local revenue choices are
specified by two variables which measure the relative size of

residential voting coalitions — the percent of city households whose

lenI

income exceeds the national 75th percentile income

(PCRICB) and

the percent of city households whose income is below the national 25th

percentile income level (PCPOOR) — one variable designed to measure
the relative mobility of city tax base to the suburbs —

any sytematic shifts in voter or bond market preferences for revenue
levels or mix, and, finally, a vector of city duny variables to

control for each city's unique political environment and the city's
status quo budget.

While these variables are a reasonable first step to specifying

the structure of revenue choice, they surely do not capture all
relevant economic and political forces. It is assumed that what
factors have not been systematically specified will have only a

8

stochastic influence across cities and time. The error structure of
the revenue model therefore allows for

the error terms —

a lagged adjustment to these "shocks through a first—order

The model is estimated by generalized least squares allowing for

errors. When estimating this system of revenue equations, the total

tax identity Lt = T allows us to either estimate all tax equations
and calculate T as the sum of each (r)
one of the

or to estimate T and all but

equations calculating the omitted individual tax as a

residual. The latter strategy is adopted here. Revenue systems
involving total taxes, property taxes, general sales taxes, selective
sales taxes, income taxes, and fees and licenses are estimated. The

omitted tax category is a residual of miscellaneous specialized city
taxes which is never more than five percent of city revenues,t9

Before examining the effects of deductibility on city fiscal

choice, it is instructive to suaarize briefly the influence of the
legal and political constraints as well as the effects of the economic

variables income, aid, and relative prices. The constraints influence
city revenues largely as expected. Cities responsible for public
education (DED) have higher taxes,

predominantly property taxes.

Cities with responsibility for welfare (DWL =

1, for Baltimore, Boston

to 1970, Denver, Indianapolis since 1971. New York City, Norfolk, and

San Francisco) are the larger, older cities. Real taxis per capita
(and possibly services) are lower, with property taxes enjoying most

of the reduction. Tax relief is given to homeowners to compensate for
the added burden of paying for at least a part of welfare outlays.

Cities restricted to general sales taxes (DGS) and/or selective sales
taxes (DSS) raise less revenue than cities with access to an inocre

tax (DI). Tax access clearly has a revenue effect. Nominal mill rate
limits (RLIX) have no statistically significant effect on revenues as

cities adjust assesaent rates or vote to override the limit. An
effective rate limit on property taxation (LEVYLIM) does reduce
revenues but thr effect is neither quantitatively nor statistically
significant in our sample cities.

Of the political constraint variables, a larger pool of rich

househelds (PatCH) seems to reduce taxes overall and property taxes
in particular; the revenue nix is biased towards sales taxation and

wage income taxation as PatCH rises. A larger pool of very low
income families marginally increases total taxes, and particularly

general sales and income taxes. The results suggest the possibility
of a majority rich—poor coalition which lowera property taxes,
increases services, and shifts the tax burden to the middle class (and

possibly fins) through the taxation of wages and retail sales. There
has been a steady annual (YEAR) upward trend in real city revenue from
all sources, a trend which has

not

been offset by the effects of the

New York City fiscal crisis or by the apparent increased taxpayer
awareness of city fiscal performance in the 1975 to 1980 period

11

(CRISIS). The measure of middle class exit to the suburbs (LRCSI) has
the expected negative effect on taxes, notably property taxation.

Economic competition appears to be a more effective check to the
growth of large city revenues than legislative constraints, at least
as they are now fashioned (RLIM, LEVYLIM)•
Relaxing the public sector's economic constraint through an
increase in residential incas. (CINC) or by reducing the costs of
goods and services in the region as a whole (PT) both increase the
city's own

revenues

and public services. An increase in the city's

grants—in—aid from categorical programs (CUD) or from general revenue
—sharing (ESAID) results in only marginal tax relief; almost all aid
is spent on public services in these large cities. The variable

Overall, the legal, economic, and political constraints have

plausible effects on city revenue behavior. That are the specific
effects of deductibility? Tables 1 and 2 detail the estimates of the
effects on city financing of changes in tax burden prices, and
explicitly, the deductibility components (B1PROP, BTINC/SAL,

B'l'SS,

BTVS, and BTINC) of those prices. Table 1 illustrates an important
result; the deductibility component and the non—resident component of
tax burden prices often have opposite, and statistically significant,

effects on city revenues. The differences were most noteable for

12

property tax burden prices; dedactiblity (BTPROP) has a positive
effect while the shire of taxes borne by residents (1—PCI) has
significant negative effect on local taxation:

the fee equation. The two components of

do not behave as one,

as the initial specification suggested.2° This result was true not
only for the full sample regressions

reported in Table 1, but for the

various subsample regressions as well. As I shall argue below
(Section B) there are good reasons for

these differences, p•rticularly

in a reduced form model such as is estimated here.21

Since our

central concern is predicting the effects of the deductibility
component on financing, I focus my discussion on these coefficients.
Further, all policy simulations will use these direct estimates.

Table 2 sunarizes the influence of

deductibility provisions on

local finance both for the full sample and for the three subsamples of

cities. Subsample 1 consists of cities who only have •ccess to
property taxes, selective sales taxes, and fees; subsample 2 consists
of cities who only have access to property taxes, selective sales
taxes, general sales taxes and fees; and subsample 3 consists of the
remaining cities who have access to property, selective

sales, income

taxes, perhaps general sales, and fees. The elasticities of total
taxes (T), each available individual tax, (ti"), fees (F), and total
revenues (T + F) with respect to changes in deductibility
are reported

in Table 2. The results show that the removal of deductibility
(Bl'PROP, BTSS, BTGS, and BTINC all rise towards 1) will increase taxes

(BTSS in subsszples 1 and 3 and BTINC in subsample 3 are the
exceptions), generally reduce fees, and, as often as not (BTSS and
BflNC are the significant exceptions), increase

13

On their face these results are, I suspect, counter—intuitive. But

two points need to be made. First, our intuition is about the short—
run; the results reported here are equilibrium, long—run estimates of
the effects of deductibility on revenues. There is a plausible long—
run explanation for these results; see section 111—B.

total revenues CT + F) will be modest, therefore, ranging from a

possible increase in revenues of 18% (BTPROP in Subsample 3) to a
possible reduction of 25% (BflNC in Subsample 3). For most reforms
now being discussed, the equilibrium revenue effects will be much
smaller; see section IV.

B. Unraveling the Revenue Restonse: Short—Ran Politics Meets Long—

Run Economics

Dissecting the long—run, equilibria response of city revenues to
deductibility reform requires *

three step argument. In step one, I

argue that deductibility reform will have a selective effect on city
taxpayers which will create pressure for upper income households to

exit the center city for the suburbs. in step two. I outline the
city's likely short—run response to that pressure as a readjustment of
the local tax rates to favor the upper incom, classes. In step three,
the long—run effects of these rate adjustments are described through

the long—run tate—revenue schedule (the familiar "Laffer curve"). If
cities are on the downward aide of the long—run revenue schedule, then
rate reductions to offset deductibility in the short—run ray actually
increase city revenues.

The removal of deductibility of state and local taxes will have
selective effects on taxpayers within our cities.

Only those who

itemize will be directly affected. Evidence reveals these families to
be the middle and upper income taxpayers, most often homeowners. The
loss of deductibility will ask. local tax payments more expensive for

these residents. The effect of this now more expensive local budget
may be

the relatively pro—poor bias of city, as compared to suburban, public

budgets; see Inman and Rubiafeld (1979).

A simple example makes the point. Upper income families who jive
within the city make a transfer to lower income families which they

The potential loss of its middle and upper income taxpayers is
a
fiscal threat the city cannot

ignore. The city has two possible

responses: increase services to the upper income neighborhoods and/or
selectively lover those taxes which fall

most heavily on the rich and

middle class. The political

reaction will no doubt be a combination
of the two, as cities attempt to
balance the competing interests of
the rich and poor.

The route to lower taxes, is of course, to lower the rates. In
the

short—run when the tax base in the city is

base. In the long—run, the increase in base begins to offset the
initial fall in revenues because of the rate reduction. If the base
increase is large enough, revenues may actually increase. This long—
run relationship between tax rates (u) and revenues (t) (popularly
called the "Laffer curve") is described in Figure 1. The long—run
schedule is the trace of points along various short—run (fixed, or
very inelastic base) schedules, where the tax—rate intersects its
equilibrium short—run schedule for its given tax base. As tax rites

this important point. Figure 2 illustrates two possible equilibria.
The dashed lines in Figure 2 represent the elected officials' chances

in a "revenue trap" or "fiscal crisis" where increasing rates only

reduce tax base and revenues in the long—run. Available evidence
suggests that local property taxes and local general sales taxes are
likely to have elastic tax bases.

24

Further, politicians in the

larger and older cities which comprise our sample are likely to face

"tight" expenditure needs and hence "flat" re—election canes between
revenue (i.e., expenditures) and tax rates. If so, tax rate—revenue

allocations such as those in Figure 2a result. For property and
general sales taxation, an equilibrium tax rate s >

is both

feasible and plausible.

The available evidence on the elasticity of local income tax

bases to rate changes suggest a relatively inelastic base.25 If

this

is so, then the peak of the income tax revenue curve will result at

relatively high local rates. The equilibrium tangency of the
politicans' still "fiat" re—election curves to the short—run revenue

schedule may therefore occur to the left of x'; see Figure Zb. Thus
for local income taxes, it is feasible and likely that ji < u

No systematic argument regarding tax base elasticity for the set
selective sales taxes seems possible.

This tax category includes

numerous miscellaneous taxes which vary greatly across sample cities.
Some of these taxes are likely to have elastic bases (tobacco, liquor,
entertainment, hotels) while the tax base of others will be rate

inelastic (public utilities). Cities' leg•l access to the individual

taxes may be restricted as well. For some cities (those who use
public utility taxes) u

What are the implications of this political economic view (i.e.,
"structural model") for interpreting our reduced—form estimates of the

19

effects of deductibility reform on city revenues? First, the proposed
model is long—run; since most of the variation in deductibility is

cross—section variation, the econometric results are long—run results
as well. Second. the model does help us to understand the possibly
counter—intuitive results of deductibility reform. For the full
sample results, a fall in property and/or income plus sales tax

deductibility stimulates total taxes, particularly from property
taxation. This result is explained by the political decision to lower
tax rates to keep the rich and upper middle class itemizers within the

city, a decision which, in the nd actually helps city revenues. It
should be noted that in the short—run city revenues decline and

services — most likely those allocated to the poor — are reduced.
Note too, that as rates fall, city politicans are moved to a
politically less preferred (lower chance of re—election) rate—revenue
allocation.

The three sets of subsample results can also be understood in
light of this model of short—run politics and long—run economics. - For

cities in subsample 1, the loss of property tax deductibility leads to

a rise in property tax revenues as predicted. But selective sales tax
revenues decline; the reason is most likely a combination of effects.
Subsample 1 cities have access to only property and selective sales

taxes. Lowering the property tax rate is a first priority. In the
short—run, however, revenues and public services will decline and to
offset, at least partially, this revenue loss selective sales tax

rates may be increased. In the long—run, if u

>

t

for

selective

sales taxes (an elastic tax base), revenue will decline. (A similar
story, but with tax roles reversed, can be told for an increase in

20

BTSS.) For cities in subsample 2, we observe a similar fiscal
reaction to the loss of deductiblity of property taxation, As BTPROP
is increased, property tax rates are reduced and long—run revenues

increase. To offset the short—run revenue loss, general sales tax
rates may be increased, but as cities are likely to be in the
declining range of this tax's long—run revenue curve (g> is),

general

sales tax revenues decline •s BTPROP rises. The tax rates for the
selective sales taxes may rise or fall, but if they fall and p > z

for those taxes (see below) then revenue

will rise with BTPROP

as is observed in subsample 2. The loss of general sales tax
deductibility (Bros rises) will lead to a short—run reduction in
general sales tax rates, but since p ) p° long—run revenues from t (OS)

rise. Property tax rates and selective sales tax rates may be
increased to soften the short—run revenue loss, but since both taxes
are on the downward side of their long—run revene curves (p ) p')

revenues will fall in the long—run. The loss of selective sales tax
deductilibity (BTSS increases) for sample 2 cities will first lower

these rates. If so, and as long—run t (SS) rises, we must conclude
-

that sample 2 cities are on the falling segment of their long—run

revenue carve, that is, u > ,.

The reduction in short—run revenues

is offset by rate increase for general sales taxes, which (as p > p5)

leads to a long—run decline in

Property revenues rise slightly

in the long—run, implying that property rates were initially reduced

as BitS rose. Finally, for cities in subsample 3, the loss of
property tax deductibility again reveals the familiar pattern. As

flROP rises, property rates are reduced and property tax revenues
rise in the long—run. To offset the short—run loss of revenues, tax
rate, on local income taxes are likely to be increased. As a

21

consequence, long—run revenues rise for income taxes (as p < p).
With the increase in BTPROPJ the rates for selective silos taxes may
rise of fall, but if they fall (as they did in subsample 2) and if

tS for

these taxes (see below) then revenues

ji

will decline as

The loss of income tax deductibility (BTINC increases)

leads to a lowering of income tax rates and a short—run and long—run

loss of income tax revenues (again as z < p). To offset the short—
run revenue loss, property tax rates and selective sales rates may be
increased; these adjustments will lead to the estimated long—run

decline in property tax revenues (as

p > is') and long—rn increase in

selective sales revenue (if p ( s'). The loss of selective sales tax
deductibility (BTSS up) is likely to lead to a lowering of these

rates. If so. and as

declines, we must conclude that sample 3

cities are on the rising segment of their selective sales revenue

curve that is, p C u'

Finally, the fall in

is offset by our

incresse in income tax revenues as income tax rates are raised.

The reactions of user fees and license revenues to changes in
deductibility also show a logical pattern.

The bulk of fees and

license revenues are charges to business for city services (transport.

sewerage, sanitation, airports). While my

focus

measures of deductibility

ou households as taxpayers, the variation in household tax

prices from deductibility provisions, tax credits, and state

are

tax rates

likely to be positively correlated with a deductibility benefit

for firms as

well.

If so, an observed loss of deductibility threatens

firm exit from the city too. A logical strategy for cities is to

lower firm taxes. Fees and license revenues is one of the major
taxes cities now impose on business. Thus an increase in BIflOP,

22

BTINC, BTGS, and BTSS should have negative effects on fees (F).

Generally they do. The only important exception is the positive
effect of an increase in BTSS on F for subsample 2; the positive

adjustments in F are very nail however, for BTSS varies at most by 4%
(thus F varies by about 5% =

1.22 x 4%). Vhere swings in tax prices

are important, the elasticity of foes is negative.

With most reduced—form analyses one can only speculate as to the

underlying structure which produces the observed behaviour. This

study is no exception. Yet such speculations are a useful test" of
the validity of the empirical analysis. Do possibly counter—intuitive
empirical results have a plausible and consistent structural

explanation? If so, our confidence in those estimates increases. I
have argued that the empirical results of Tables 1 and 2 can be

supported by such a structural explanation. To be sure, more research
is needed to reveal the true structure of local fiscal choice, but the
model presented here of short—run politics and

long—rn

economics must

be regarded as a plausible contender.26

IV. Deductibility Reform and City Revenues
Table 3 summarizes the predicted effects of alternative
deductibility reform proposals on city revenues, first for our full

sample and then for each of the three subsamples. (A data appendix
lists the cities in each subsample.) For each reform, I estimate the
implied dollar change from the average 1980 values of real (deflated)

taxes per capita CT) and real fees per capita (F) for each sample.
The initial 1980 levels of taxes and fees are listed in Table

3. I

also calculate the percentage change in taxes or fees from their 1980
values.

Policy options 1 to 4 remove deductibility for local property
taxation only (1), general sales

only

taxation only (2), income taxation

(3). and finally for all local

taxes Simultaneously (4). To

estimate effects of reform on revenues, the revenue elasticities in

Table 2 corresponding to each tax price and sample were
multiplied by
the percentage increase in each

deductibility component. I assume the

deductibility component of tax price will rise to 1.0 when federal

deductibility is removed. This is an overestimate of the change in
tax price since state deductibility of
credits for property taxation

local taxes and state tax

may not disappear. The estimates in

Table 2 are therefore maximal estimates

of revenue adjustment. The

total effect on city revenues will be the sum of the dollar changes in
taxes and fees.

Policy options 5 to 8 all seek to reduce

the possible negative

effects on state and local revenues of reform while retaining the

potential efficiency and tax equity advantages of removing

deductibility. To reduce the potential revenue loss to state and
local governments, particnlarly in the short—run, we can either allow
partial deductibility (options S and 6) or offer offsetting subsidies
to taxpayers (option 7) or to local

however, will reduce the net savings

Treasury and ACIR (1985 chapter 3)

estimate that option 4, full removal of deductibility, will save *34
billion of federal tax revenues

annually. Policy optiona 5—8 allocate

some of theee savings to ease the burden of reform. To Insure
comparability, the policy parameters of proposals 5 to 8 are set so
that each costs approximately *19 billion in lost federal revenues;
see ACIR (1985. chapter 3).

24

Option.5only allowsdeductibil ity of local taxes which exceed a
floor of 1% of taxpayers' adjusted gross income. I have assumed the
typical itemizer is in the 28% marginal tax bracket and has an

adjusted gross income of *40.000. Thus under option 5 the taxpayer
can deduct all state and local taxes over *400. Since most taxpayers
pay in excess of *400/year in state—loc.l taxes, the taxpayers can

still itemize marginal local tax payments. The price effect of
deductibility remains. However, itemizers loses .28 x *400 in lost
deductions or approximately *120/year. This income loss can reduce
local taxes and fees (see Table 1; CIINC coefficient). If we assume
the resulting loss in income per capita is about *30 per year

(*120/year + 4 members per family), then revenues will decline as
27
shown in Table 3, row 5.
Policy Option 6 is a variation of policy 5; taxpayers are still
allowed to deduct but now only to a ceiling of 6.S% of adjusted gross

income. Beyond this ceiling local taxes are not deductible. For the
typical itemizes in the 28% marginal tax bracket and earning Mo,ooo,
state and local taxes up to *2600 per family will be deductible (=

.065 x *40,000). Only taxpayers in very high tax states and cities
will be affected by the 6.5% ceiling. Those affected will lose
deductibility for taxes above *2600. but they retain a fixed gain

of

*728 (—.28 x $2600) from the deduction up to the ceiling. The effects
of this reform on city revenues is difficult to predict precisely.
Cities whoes itemizers pay less than their ceiling in state and local

taxes are unaffected by the reform. Cities whose typical itemizers
pay more than their ceilings may adjust revenues. This adjustment is
estimated as a combination of the revenue effects of optLon 4 offset

25

by the revenue increases which remit from increased resident income
(from income with option 4) because of the fixed gain from the partial

deduction (n

*728/family

or *182 per capita). See Table 3. row 6.

Policy option 7 partially offsets the loss of deductibility by a
tax credit for local taxation defined as y in our •arlier definition

of the tax price. The size of the credit is set so as to cost the

Treasury approximately $19 billion: y — .07 under this reform.

28

Co.bining lost deductibility with a 7% credit will increase the

deductibility components of sales income, and property tsr prices

from their initial values (

.86) to

.93. The resulting revenue

adjustments are reported in Table 3, row 7.
Option 8 gives the city the direct revenue assistance to offset
any negative effects of deductibility reform.

In this reform •ll

state—local tare. lose federal deductibility but state and local
governments receive *19 billion in revenue—sharing aid as

compensation. I estimate that approximately $33 per resident will be
returned to local governments.29

Not all of the *33 transfer goes to

city services, however; some (a small amount) may be allocated to tax

relief (see Table 1; RSAID coefficient). Table 3, row 8 estimates the
equilibrium changes in tax and fees under option 8. to estimate the
total revenue effects of this reform, the *33 transfer must be added
to the estimated changes in fees and taxes.
Other reforms are of course possible and have been suggested.

Table 3's results bound the likely effects of the other major reform

proposals. The lemp-lasten proposal which would retain deductibility
for property taxation (at 25% rate only however) but disallow
deductibility of sales and income taxes will have effects
approximately equal to the sum of those for policies 2 (sales) and 3

26

(income) in Table 3. The Bradley—Gephardt tax reform plan drops sales
tax deductibility (option 2) and lowers the rate (to 14%) at which

property and income taxes can be deducted. The effects of this reform
are bounded between thosefron option 2 (only sales) and option 4
(full removal).

That is the effect of deductibility reform on city revenues?
Four conclusions emerge frog the policy simulations in Table 3.
First, total taxes change very little in the long—run, falling by at
most 13% (reform 3, subsample 3) and generally rising slightly.

Second, fees and license revenue (predominantly a tax on fins)
generally fall, often significantly (policies 4,6, and 8 for
subsamples 2 and

3). 30

Third, the net long—run effect on total

revenues (AT +F) of full deductibility reform (options 4 to 8) is
usually positive, but when negative, the revenue loss is at most 12%
of pre—refora revenues (—

—*24.68/1201 for option 4, subsample 2).

Fourth, the offset policies 5

to

8 reduce the revenue effects

significantly. In fact, the revunue—sharing offset (policy 8)
substantially increases city revenues once we add *33 per capita of
revenue—sharing aid to the city budget.

While the results in Table 3 should be encouraging to the
proponents of state and local deductibility reform, we must remember
that these estimates apply only to large cities and they measure only

the long—run effects of dropping deductibility. States and suburban
goveraents say behave quite differently; see lenyon (1985) and

Graslich (1935). And

there

is no doubt that in the short—run cities

will feel the pressure to lower taxes and public services.

27

V. Conclusion: Should We Drop Deductibility?
Removing the deductibility of state and local taxes has emerged
as the cornerstone of the recent efforts to reform the current federal

tax code. While numerous other deductions or 'loopholes ire closed
by the Treasury's tax package, it is state and local deductibility
reform which provides the revenues needed to lower overall rates and

to raise the level of personal exemptions. While fewer loopholes or a
simplier tax code is always a worthwhile objective, one suspects it is

tat relief which makes the Treasury's proposal so politically

appealing. Yet it is important to consider the removal of state and
local tax deductibility as a policy in its own right, not simply as a

source of new federal revenues. The enpirial analysis presented here
may help us to decide the issue.

First, the major efficiency gains from deductibility reform, at
least for our central cities, will come not from

lower

local public

spending but from a more efficient structure of local taxation.

Deductibility reform is likely to lower tax rates on property1 retail

sales, and wage income in the center cities. Each of these taxes is a
source of significant resource misallocation, discouraging the

efficient location of housing and productive capital.31 Further, as
our

central

cities appear to be on the downward aide of their rate—

revenue schedules for property and sales taxation, lower rates may

actually mean more revenues and thus public services. Deductibility
reform "shocks" the central city away from a politically expedient.

28

but economically inefficient. structure of local finance.
Second, there are gains in public sector equity, but a full
federal—state—local budgetary incidence will be required to weigh the

pluses and minuses across income classes. The removal of
deductibility itself and the return of those revenues as lower tax
rates and higher personal exemptions clesrly helps lower income
families.

Only rich families are

itemizers, while all households gain

from the reduction in federal rates. The likely incidence effects
within

taxes

the local public sector

are more difficult to judge. Local

nay become more regressive to the extent cities can

legally

tilt

their rste structures, and city services (as argued in 111—B above)

are likely to become more pro—rich. Yet city services may also
increase for all households in

the

long—run as city revenues rise. It

is not clear the center city poor will lose services in the long—run.

Public services in the suburbs are likely to fall, however. If
suburban governments have avoided the politically inefficient

revenue

trap0 and are still on the rising portion of the tax rate—revenue
schedule, then

the

loss of deductibility will lesd to lower service

demands by as much as ten percent (Gramlich. 1985). Thus

deductibility

reform nay

narrow

public service inequities between city

and suburban residents. On balance lower income, non—itemizers gain
federal tax relief and

possibly

lose local public services. Upper

income itemizers within the city pay higher federal taxes but gain

local public services. Upper income ite.izers within the suburbs will
pay higher federal taxes and lose local public services. Whether
these re—allocations constitute a net gain in social equity clearly
depends on

one's

sense of fairness and relative weighting of public

29

vs. private goods.

be too little variation in the dependent variable over the sample

2Preyious work on the effects of federal tax laws on local and state

finance has been limited to one year cross—section analyses; see Inman

(1979). Hettich and Winer (1984), and lenyon (1985). Such cross—
section studies cannot adequately control for unmeasured political,
economic, or institutional differences across observations.

differences which may be highly correlated with the extent of

31

deductibility or taxpayer itemization (often used as a proxy for

deductibility). Therefore the estimated infloence of deductibility
may be badly biased in such studies. Estimation using pooled cross—
section, times—series data is the only solution to these proble.s.

5All fiscal data for this study are from the annual U.S. Census

publication, City Government Finances, for the fiscal years 1960 to

1979—80. The revenue categories analyzed here correspond to the
Census' definition of total taxes CT), tax revenue from property
taxation Ct

(1)

), general sales taxation Ct (2) ), selective sales

taxation (t3), income taxation (t4), all "other" taxes (t5), and
fees and licenses (F •

licenses" plus "charges and miscellaneous general revenue" sinus

"charges for higher education"). Total revenue (K) corresponds to the
category "general revenue from own aources" titus "charges for higher

availability on revenue decisions. I also divide th, forty—one city
sszple into three, mutually exclusive subsamples according to tax

instrument availablity; see Data Appendix for details. This more

general treatment allows both the intercept (a.) and slope

different taxes.

7lost states will impose rate limitations on local sales taxation and

local income taxation as well, but information on the exact limits
were not available for all years of our sample. That data were
available showed little variation (rates usually between 1% and 2%)

across the cities in our staple. Thus the tax—access dummy variables
DI and DOS will, in effect, be rate limit dummy variables where DI —0
and DOS

0 mean a rate limit equal to 0.

It is important to emphasize that even when cities face effective
rate limits, tax revenues from the constrained tax are still
endogenous as city's often retain control over tax base and always

retain control over enforcement and collection, Tax rates are only
one, though probably the most important, of the control variables to
limit local revenues.

Features of Fiscal Federalism, various years. The credit rite (y) for
eligible taxpayers ii defined as j'

a (average

benefit paid per

claimant/average property tax paid per claimint) for each state. As
mOat programs are limited by income, only those taxpayers in each city

who are income eligible are allowed a value of y > 0. If in age
restriction also applies (often only taxpayers over 62 are eligible),
y was multiplied by the percent of households in the city over the age

limit. A similar adjustment was made if the program was limited to
homeowners; y was multiplied by the percent of households who are

homeowners. Unfortunately data on age and hone ownership by income
class ire not available by city; thus a more precise estimate of the
average rate of credit could not be calculated.

'3Data on the percent of city property assessed as commerical—

industrial property (PCI) are available from the publication ProDerty
Taxation, Census of Government, for the years 1957, 1962, 1967. 1972,

1977, and 1982. Simple linear trends were calculated for the
intervening sample years.

The percent of general sales taxation paid by non—residents
(PNRGS) was estimated as the ratio —

resident

(total

retail sales in the city —

purchases)/(total retail sales in the city), where resident

purchases was approximated by the share of residents' disposable

income apent on taxable items. Taxable items under general sales
taxation generally include all expenditures except services,
transportation, health care, and housing; the taxable sharp was

estimated to be .6 of disposable income (see Honthakker and Taylor

(1970) or Rock (Table 1. 1984). Data for retail sales in the city and

35

for disposable income are available frog Sale Management, Survey of
Buying Power, for the years 1960—1980.

The percent of selective sales taxation paid by non—residents
(PNRSS) is in principle estimated by the ratio —
sales in the city —

resident

(total

selective

purchases of selective sales)/(total

selective sales in the city), where 'selective saless is defined to
include public utility sales in cities which tax public utility sales
and entertainment, hotel, and recreation activities in cities which

tax these activities. Data on entertainment, hotel and recreation
expenditures in cities are available from Sales Management. Survey of

Buying Power; 1960—1980. The residents' expenditures on
entertainment, hotel and recreation within the city was

.03

estimated

as

of residents' disposable income; this share is one—kilt of the

total share of disposable income generally allocated to such

Taylor

activities; see Houthakker and

(1970). Data on public utility

sales are not available by city. I therefore assumed all of public

utility taxes — the bulk of which are paid by firms —

fall

on non—

residents. With this adjustment PNRSS is now approximated by the
ratio —

(public

utility taxes +

G(total

selective sales taxes —

public

utility taxes)/(selective sales taxes), where 0 equals the non—
residents share of entertainment, hotel, and recreation expenditures
within the city.

The percent of city wages earned by non—residents (flIRT) is

approximated by the ratio (suburban income per family x number of

the city is the sum of suburban commuter income plus city resident

income earned in the city, City resident income is estimated as

city

(i.e., total city jobs less jobs held by commuters). Data on city

17The variable, ratio of city to suburban income (KCSI), has been used

with some success in other work Unman, 1982) to measure the potential
mobility of city residents to suburbs. Cities whose mean household

37

income is low relative to mean suburban income have poor residents
surrounded by relatively rich suburbs (small valu,s of RCSI) while
cities whose sean income is high relative to mean suburban inocme have
relatively rich residents surrounded by poor suburbs (high values of

RCSI). In both instances, acceptable suburban housing will be
unavailable to city residents who wish to leave. Exit will therefore
be limited. Regions where mean city and suburban incomes are
approximately equal will have acre extensive suburban housing options

for city residents, and the threat of exitwill be more intensely felt

by city officials. The ideal specification is therefore RCSI and

RCSI2. This specification was

tried,

and in all cases a minimum or

aaxnaum was achieved well beyond the limits of our sample. To
conserve degrees of freedom the log specification was therefore
adopted.

La I shall argue below there are compelling reasons
for different effects of these variables on city revenues; see section

21The arguments for the separate effects of deductibility and non-

resident taxation on city revenues raises the possiblity that PCI,
PNEGS. PNRSS, and PNRI are not exogenous but in fact deternined in

part by revenues. To test for the possibility of serious simultaneous
equation bias in our estimates of the effects of deductibility on
revenues, I re—estimated all models excluding PCI, PNRGS, PNRSS, PNRT,

and (for similar reasona) ASBINT. The coefficients on the
deductibility variables were essentially unchanged.

23See Fair (1978). Given the high mobility of voters into and out of
local comeunities, the what—have—you—done—for_ne_latelys mentality

may be rational for local voters as well. See Inman (1982) on pension
funding.

24See Grieson (1974) on property taxation and Grieson fl j. (1977)

25Labor supply elasticities are generally lot, but sOre iaportantly
the elasticity of job location with respect to tax rates is also

modest. Gruenstein (1980) estimates that while Philadelphia does lose
jobs with tax increases, total wage tax revenues are still increasing.

effects are similar to those given in Table 1 for the full sample.
Subsample regressions are available from the author upon request.

28The credit is defined so as to return $19 billion to the state and

local sector as a subsidy to state and local taxation. I estimate
state and local taxes to be about $260 billion in 1985; thus y =

*19b1*260b

.07.

29The general revenue sharing program will spend $19 billion per year

or $85 per capita. Approximately 39 percent of total state and local
taxes are raised by local governments. If federal aid is divided
between the state and local sectors according to resident taxes paid.
then 39 percent of total aid or *33 per capita (— .39 x *85) will be
given to local governments.

301t should be noted that the Treasury's most recent proposal
continues to permit firms to deduct state and local taxes as a

41

business expense. If the argument in section III is correct that fees
ire reduced to soften the blow to firms of lost deductibility, then

the induced reduction in fees under the Treasury pin should be less
than the losses reported in Table 3. There may still be pressure to
lower fees under the Treasury proposal to the extent that lost

deductibility for households is shifted to firms. For example, fins
ny bear the burden of differential local wage and sales taxation. In
any case, the fee reductions in Ttbl• 3 are likely to be an on outer

estimate of the revenue loss with deductibility reform.
