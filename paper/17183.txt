ABSTRACT
We evaluate the results of a field experiment designed to measure the effect of prompts to form implementation
intentions on realized behavioral outcomes. The outcome of interest is influenza vaccination receipt
at free on-site clinics offered by a large firm to its employees. All employees eligible for study participation
received reminder mailings that listed the times and locations of the relevant vaccination clinics. Mailings
to employees randomly assigned to the treatment conditions additionally included a prompt to write
down either (1) the date the employee planned to be vaccinated or (2) the date and time the employee
planned to be vaccinated. Vaccination rates increased when these implementation intentions prompts
were included in the mailing. The vaccination rate among control condition employees was 33.1%.
Employees who received the prompt to write down just a date had a vaccination rate 1.5 percentage
points higher than the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant. Employees who
received the more specific prompt to write down both a date and a time had a 4.2 percentage point
higher vaccination rate, a difference that is both statistically significant and of meaningful magnitude.

Seasonal influenza leads to more than 200,000 hospitalizations and more than 8,000
deaths in the U.S. each year (1, 2). The influenza vaccine is widely available at low cost and
reduces mortality (3-5), morbidity (3-6), and healthcare costs (3, 6). Nevertheless, many of those
for whom vaccination is indicated fail to comply with CDC recommendations for vaccination
(7). If low compliance is the result of individuals’ careful calculations weighing the costs and
benefits of vaccination, it may be difficult and expensive for policymakers and organizational
leaders to increase vaccination rates. On the other hand, if low compliance is the result of
forgetfulness or procrastination, low-cost interventions that use psychological tools may be
effective at increasing vaccination rates and improving public health.
The potential for low-cost psychological interventions to change behavior has been
documented in previous research (8-10). For example, changing defaults—the outcomes that
result when no action is taken—has been shown to have a sizeable effect on organ donation rates
(11), immunization rates (12), and savings plan enrollment (13). Providing information on social
norms has been used to reduce household energy consumption (14, 15). This paper evaluates
another behavioral intervention—planning prompts—in a field setting.
Research in psychology has demonstrated that prompting people to develop a plan of the
form, “When situation x arises, I will implement response y,” increases attainment of desired
goals (16-20). Simply asking people to develop such a plan, or an “implementation intention,” is
all that is necessary to trigger an association between the desired behavior and a concrete future
moment (19). A prompt to form an implementation intention is a “nudge” (8) in the direction of
desired behavior that can be applied at minimal expense and does not restrict individual
autonomy (9).

-1-

To investigate the efficacy of implementation intentions prompts, we conducted a threearm randomized controlled trial. The outcome of interest was influenza vaccination receipt.
Employees at a large firm were randomly assigned to receive one of three mailings about
workplace vaccination clinics. All mailings informed recipients of the dates and times of clinics
at their work location. In addition, some mailers prompted recipients to write down either (1) the
date they planned to get their vaccination (date plan condition), or (2) the date and time they
planned to get their vaccination (time plan condition). Figure 1 shows the component of the
mailer that varied across conditions.
Comparing the vaccination rates of employees in the two treatment conditions to the
vaccination rates of employees in the control condition whose mailers did not include an
implementation intentions prompt, we find that vaccination rates were increasing in the
specificity of the prompt received. The vaccination rate among control condition employees was
33.1%. Employees who received the prompt to write down just a date had a vaccination rate 1.5
percentage points higher than the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant at
the 5% level. Those who received the more specific prompt to write down both a date and a time
had a 4.2 percentage point higher vaccination rate, a difference that is both statistically
significant at the 5% level and of a meaningful magnitude. The intervention had a larger impact
at sites that offered vaccination clinics on only one day than at sites that offered clinics on
multiple days, suggesting that implementation intentions prompts may be more effective in
settings where an opportunity is available for only a short time.
To our knowledge, this is the first large field study to evaluate the power of
implementation intentions prompts in isolation and without confounding influences. Although
past research has demonstrated that planning interventions can increase the frequency of

-2-

prompted behavior for various outcomes ranging from mammography to voting (19), our study
differs from past research in several important ways. First, in many past studies, the effect of the
planning intervention could not be distinguished from the effect of social pressure because the
intervention involved face-to-face or telephone contact (16, 20-24). This study does not involve
social pressure: whether subjects ignored the mailings was not observed, and any plans
formulated were not communicated to the experimenters, the employer, or any other party.
Second, the treatment conditions in many previous studies have provided subjects with
supplemental information that was relevant to the outcome participants were being prompted to
achieve (16, 21, 22, 25). Our two treatment condition mailings did not contain any information
not in the control condition mailing, allowing us to isolate the effect of the implementation
intentions prompt. Third, we directly observe the outcome of interest because we have
administrative data on vaccinations; many past studies use subject self-reports, which are
vulnerable to reporting bias, as their outcome (21-24, 26). Fourth, in this study, not only were
outcomes measured objectively, but participants did not know that their behavior was being
observed. In previous studies, awareness of study participation could have altered behavior (27).
Fifth, many past studies have much smaller sample sizes than this study (16, 21-24, 26, 28),
making it difficult to precisely measure the impact of the implementation intentions
interventions. Finally, many past studies have experienced high rates of attrition (22-26, 28),
while this study had almost no attrition.
In addition to improving our understanding of implementation intentions prompts and
informing policies that promote public health, our study has implications for economic models of
individual decision-making. In most models where individuals fail to take an action that is in
their long-run best interest, the mechanism that causes this failure is an overweighting of the

-3-

immediate costs of the action (29-31) or a lack of relevant information or information-processing
ability (32). This study suggests that the lack of a concrete plan for implementing a desired
action can also contribute to gaps between an individual’s intentions and actions.

Results
All 3,272 employees at a large Midwestern utility firm with vaccination indications—
individuals 50 years of age or older or those with chronic health conditions that increase the risk
of influenza-related complications (7,33)—were randomly assigned to receive one of three
mailings about the firm’s on-site influenza vaccination clinics. As described in detail in the
Methods section of this paper, more information is available about employees enrolled in the
company’s Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) health plan than about employees enrolled in
a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan. Thus, we present our results not only for these
two groups together, but also separately for the PPO study subjects only.
As expected in a randomized controlled experiment, we found no significant differences
in individual characteristics across the three experimental groups (Table 1). We did find
differences across the three groups in vaccination clinic characteristics: participants in the date
plan condition work at locations with vaccination clinics that were longer on average than
participants in the control condition, both in terms of clinic days (1.6 day difference of means,
95% CI 1.5 to 1.8 days) and total clinic hours (10.8 hour difference of means, 95% CI 9.4 to 12.1
hours). These differences result from the study design which, by necessity, excludes from the
date plan condition any employees who had access to only a single-day clinic (see Methods). If
we restrict the sample to locations with multi-day clinics, we find no differences in the clinic
variables across experimental conditions at the 5% significance level.

-4-

Table 2 shows the vaccination rates for the three experimental conditions and, for the two
treatment conditions, the difference in the vaccination rate relative to the control condition. The
vaccination rate among control condition employees in the full sample was 33.1%. In the two
treatment conditions, the vaccination rate increases with the specificity of the implementation
intentions prompt received by employees. Those who received the more general prompt to write
down just a date—participants in the date plan condition—had a vaccination rate of 35.6%, a 2.4
percentage point increase relative to the control condition (95% CI for difference of means, -1.9
to 6.8 percentage points) that is not significant (P=.27). The vaccination rate of those who
received the more specific prompt to write down a date and time—participants in the time plan
condition—was 37.1%, a significant increase of 4.0 percentage points (95% CI for difference of
means, 0.3 to 7.7 percentage points; P=.04) relative to the control condition.
The regression-adjusted differences in treatment condition vaccination rates relative to
the control condition are similar to the differences obtained without regression adjustment. The
adjusted estimates control for the full sample individual characteristics in Table 1 and work
location fixed effects (which subsume the clinic variables in Table 1). The regression-adjusted
difference between the date plan condition and the control condition is 1.5 percentage points
(95% CI -3.0 to 6.1 percentage points, P=.51), whereas the regression-adjusted difference
between the time plan condition and the control condition is 4.2 percentage points (95% CI 0.5
to 7.8 percentage points, P=.03). Estimated coefficients for control variables in all the
regressions discussed in this paper are reported along with the associated standard errors as
Supplementary Information.
We next turn to an examination of the subsample of employees enrolled in the PPO
health plan. For this group, we report two sets of regression-adjusted differences in vaccination

-5-

rates, the first controlling for work location and characteristics observed for all study
participants, and the second controlling for these variables plus the characteristics observed only
for the PPO subsample.
The implementation intentions intervention effects are larger for the PPO subsample than
for the full sample (Table 2). Relative to the control group, assignment to the date plan condition
increased the unadjusted probability of vaccination by 4.2 percentage points (95% CI -0.6 to 9.0
percentage points, P=.09) and the regression-adjusted probability of vaccination by 3.9
percentage points with the smaller set of regression controls (95% CI -1.2 to 9.0 percentage
points, P=.14) and 5.3 percentage points with the larger set of regression controls (95% CI 0.3 to
10.3 percentage points, P=.04). Assignment to the time plan condition increased the unadjusted
probability of vaccination at a workplace clinic by 5.7 percentage points (95% CI 1.5 to 9.9
percentage points, P <.01) and the regression-adjusted probability of vaccination by 6.2
percentage points with the smaller set of controls (95% CI 2.1 to 10.4 percentage points, P<.01)
and 6.0 percentage points with the larger set of controls (95% CI 2.0 to 10.1 percentage points, P
<.01).
In the PPO subsample, we also observe insurance claims submitted for influenza
vaccinations received outside of workplace clinics. Therefore, we can examine the broader
outcome of whether an employee was vaccinated at either a workplace clinic or some other
location. The implementation intentions interventions increased this more expansive measure of
vaccination rates, although the effects are slightly smaller than the effects on vaccination rates at
just the workplace clinics. The regression-adjusted effect (using the larger set of controls) of
being in the date plan condition on receiving a vaccine at any location is 4.9 percentage points
(95% CI -0.1 to 9.9 percentage points, P=.06), whereas the corresponding effect on receiving a

-6-

vaccine at a workplace clinic is 5.3 percentage points; the regression-adjusted effect (using the
larger set of controls) of being in the time plan condition on receiving a vaccine at any location is
5.5 percentage points (95% CI 1.5 to 9.5 percentage points, P<.01), while the corresponding
effect on receiving a workplace vaccination is 6.0 percentage points.
These results indicate that some of the workplace vaccinations induced by the
implementation intentions interventions displaced vaccinations that employees would have
received elsewhere. We probably measure most of this displacement, since our data set for PPO
members includes all free vaccinations (on-site) and all reimbursed vaccinations (off-site). The
magnitudes of the displacement effects for the PPO members are not very large: 0.4 percentage
points of the vaccinations induced by the date plan condition displaced off-site vaccinations, and
0.5 percentage points of the vaccinations induced by the time plan condition displaced off-site
vaccinations.
Although unanticipated ex ante, our analyses reveal that the effect of the time plan
condition mailing was substantially larger among employees working at locations that offered
clinics on only one day than among those working at locations with multi-day clinics (see Figure
2). Regression-adjusted point estimates of the increase in vaccination rates induced by the time
plan condition mailing at one-day clinic sites range from 7.9 to 9.5 percentage points depending
upon the regression specification (see Supplementary Information Table S2). Regressionadjusted point estimates of the increase in vaccination rates induced by the time plan condition
mailing at multi-day clinic sites were considerably smaller, ranging from 1.7 to 4.3 percentage
points across specifications and failing to reach statistical significance (see Supplementary
Information Table S3). Although this differential impact may be due to unobserved differences
between employees at work locations with limited versus extensive clinic availability, the results

-7-

are consistent with implementation intentions prompts being most effective for opportunities that
are available for only a short time. A momentary episode of forgetfulness can cause such shortlived opportunities to be foregone altogether. Thus, the effectiveness of implementation
intentions prompts may depend on subtle features of the decision-making environment.
We do not observe any significant interactions between our treatment conditions and
other known characteristics of the population studied (gender, age, race, marital status, parental
status, flu shot received last year, visits to doctor last year, diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure,
or high cholesterol).

Discussion
This study shows that encouraging people to make a plan to accomplish a desired
outcome can significantly increase their likelihood of success. In the context of a vaccination
reminder mailing, prompting recipients to consider and write down the date and time when they
planned to get their flu shot increased vaccination rates by 4 percentage points relative to a
baseline vaccination rate of 33% among a control group whose reminder mailing did not include
an implementation intentions prompt. The fact that the time plan condition had a larger impact at
one-day clinic sites than at multi-day clinic sites suggests that implementation intentions prompts
may be most effective at encouraging behaviors when the opportunity for action is fleeting.
These findings have the potential to strengthen future efforts to improve public health by
increasing vaccination rates. Past research has shown that reminder letters are among the most
cost-effective ways to encourage patient immunization, increasing compliance by an average of
8 percentage points (34, 35). By comparison, our study shows that incorporating a specific
element into a reminder mailing—a prompt to form an implementation intention—increases

-8-

vaccination rates by 4 percentage points at no incremental printing/mailing cost. Another
minimal-cost component of the mailers in all of our study arms, including the control
condition—informing recipients of the time and place of the flu shot clinics—has been shown in
previous research to increase immunization rates by 8.6 percentage points (36).
More generally, implementation intentions prompts may be an effective and low-cost
way to increase a wide range of constructive actions that individuals intend but fail to execute.
This includes other health-related actions, such as completing a health assessment or scheduling
a colonoscopy, as well as non-health-related actions such as purchasing life insurance, procuring
a will, opening a savings account, or switching to energy-efficient light bulbs.
Our study has several limitations. The sample of predominately male employees at a
single firm is not representative of the broader population. Another concern is that some
participants, even in the PPO subsample, may have received influenza vaccinations that we
cannot observe, although past research shows that most influenza vaccinations occur at work or a
doctor’s office (37). Also, our experimental design has two treatment groups and a control
group, so a reader assessing the overall study should keep the two planned comparisons in mind
when interpreting our statistical tests based on single comparisons. Finally, the intervention took
place during the fall of 2009. We study seasonal influenza vaccinations, and vaccination against
the prevailing H1N1 strain of influenza was not included in the 2009-2010 seasonal influenza
vaccine. A separate vaccine against the H1N1 influenza strain was in limited supply during the
fall of 2009, and news stories about both the H1N1 strain and shortages of the H1N1 vaccine
were widespread. Conditions during the fall of 2009 may limit the generalizability of this study’s
results, although they do not contaminate the study itself, as individuals in all experimental arms
faced the same background circumstances.

-9-

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that for employees at a large firm with influenza
vaccine indications (age ≥50 years or chronic disease), adding a simple planning prompt to an
influenza vaccination clinic reminder mailing meaningfully increased vaccination rates. These
findings suggest that models of individual decision-making might be improved if they recognize
the role of concrete plans in the translation of intentions into actions. In addition, this study
contributes to a growing literature on the value of using behavioral “nudges” to influence a wide
range of individual outcomes.

Methods
Subjects
The participants in this study were employees at a large Midwestern utility company.
Figure 3 shows the flow of study participants. Of the 9,029 active employees at the firm in
October 2009, only those meeting the then-current CDC influenza vaccine recommendations
were authorized by the employer for study inclusion: individuals 50 years of age or older and
those with chronic health conditions that increase the risk of influenza-related complications (7).
All 3,272 employees meeting these criteria were included in the study and received a mailing
about the firm’s influenza vaccination clinics.

-10-

Human Subjects Protections
Before this project commenced, it was thoroughly reviewed and approved by the
institutional review boards of the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and the
National Bureau of Economic Research. These IRBs determined that a waiver of informed
consent was appropriate per Federal regulations (45 CFR 46.116(d)). No identifying information
about study participants was ever shared with the researchers – all identifying information was
stripped from the relevant data set by our partner organization (Evive Health) and replaced with
unique random numbers.
Procedures
The study firm offered free on-site seasonal influenza vaccinations to its employees in the
fall of 2009. The firm retained Evive Health, a personalized healthcare communications
provider, to send mailers to employees for whom influenza vaccination was indicated by CDC
guidelines. The mailers informed employees of the clinics’ timing and location and encouraged
them to attend. All mailer recipients were study participants (Figure 3).
In collaboration with Evive Health, we developed three versions of the mailer. All
mailers contained information about how and why to obtain an influenza vaccine. The control
condition mailer included no additional content. The two treatment condition mailers included an
additional line of text: “Many people find it helpful to make a plan for getting their shot. You can
write yours here:” (Figure 1). In the time plan condition, spaces below this text indicated where
recipients could write down the date and time they planned to get their vaccine. In the date plan
condition, spaces indicated where recipients could write down the date (but not the time) they
planned to get their vaccine. Mailings were sent simultaneously by Evive Health to all eligible
employees in early October 2009.

-11-

The employees who received influenza vaccination reminder mailers were spread across
62 work locations. At each location, on-site clinics were offered on different dates between
October 13 and November 16, 2009. In some locations, clinics were held for only a portion of a
single day. In other locations, full-day, three-day, or five-day clinics were held.
Participants were stratified on the basis of work location and then randomized into the
three experimental conditions. Of the 3,272 employees included in the study, 2,221 employees
worked at locations with multi-day vaccination clinics. At these locations, employees were
randomized evenly within work location into the three experimental conditions. For the 1,051
employees at locations with one-day clinics, the date plan condition was not relevant, and
employees were randomized evenly within work location into the control condition and the time
plan condition. As a result, the number of participants in the control and time plan conditions is
similar (1,268 and 1,270 participants respectively), whereas the number of participants in the
date plan condition is smaller (734 participants) (see Figure 3). All 3,272 employees assigned to
an experimental condition are included in our data analysis, as we observe whether each of them
received a vaccination at a workplace clinic. Further, we include all 3,272 employees in our
study rather than restricting our sample to multi-day clinic sites in order to increase our study’s
power to detect an increase in vaccinations as a result of our planning prompt. Of the 3,272
employees studied, only 5 were no longer employed by the firm at the end of November 2009
(the last month when on-site clinics were held), and even in these cases we observe whether a
vaccination was received at a workplace clinic before the employment relationship ended.
Differences in employees’ health insurance elections are important to note. Evive Health
receives health data about all of the firm’s employees enrolled in a Preferred Provider
Organization (PPO) health plan, including the frequency of doctor visits and the presence of

-12-

health conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, etc.). Evive Health does not receive this information for
employees enrolled in a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan. Thus, while the full set
of CDC influenza vaccination criteria was used to select the 2,629 PPO members in this study
(38% of whom were selected solely on the basis of their health conditions and not their age),
almost all (99%) of the 643 HMO members in this study were eligible on the basis of age (Evive
Health had health data on some HMO members who had formerly been covered by a PPO).
Because we have more health-related information on employees enrolled in the PPO, we analyze
the impact of our intervention both on the full sample of mailing recipients and on the subsample
of recipients with PPO coverage.
Statistical Analyses
The primary outcome of interest is receipt of a seasonal influenza vaccination at one of
the firm’s on-site clinics in the fall of 2009. Vaccination recipients were tracked at each clinic
location.
We can additionally observe PPO members’ influenza vaccinations outside of the
workplace clinics using insurance claims submitted from July 2009 through April 2010. This
allows us to examine a broader outcome measure for this subgroup: receipt of an influenza
vaccine at any location. With this broader outcome measure, we can also assess whether the
incremental workplace vaccinations induced by the implementation intentions interventions
displaced vaccinations that would have occurred elsewhere.
We evaluate the impact of the implementation intentions interventions on an intent-totreat basis by calculating the difference in vaccination rates between the two treatment
conditions and the control condition. We do this on both an unadjusted basis and a regressionadjusted basis. The regression-adjusted differences are calculated using ordinary least squares

-13-

(OLS) regressions of a binary vaccination receipt indicator at the individual level on individual
characteristics, work location indicator variables, and indicator variables for the individual’s
experimental condition. We calculate regression-adjusted differences in vaccination rates for
several reasons. First, a regression framework allows us to control for demographic and clinic
characteristics that may affect vaccination rates. Although controlling for demographic
characteristics should not substantively affect the estimated differences in vaccination rates
across experimental conditions if the assignment to conditions is random, using these controls
will increase the statistical precision of the estimated differences. Second, controlling for
location fixed effects allows us to parsimoniously control for an important difference between
the date plan condition and the other two conditions: employees in the date plan condition
worked only at locations that offered multi-day vaccination clinics, whereas the control and time
plan conditions also include employees at single-day clinic locations. Finally, a regression
framework allows us to more easily assess whether the treatment effects varied by demographic
or clinic characteristics.

Difference between treatment and control conditions significant at P≤.05.
b
Regression controls include gender, age, marital status, parental status, race/ethnicity, PPO membership, and
location fixed effects. Confidence intervals are calculated using standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity.
c
Regression controls include gender, age, marital status, parental status, race/ethnicity, flu shot receipt at the
workplace clinic the previous year, number of doctor office visits between 1/1/09 and 9/1/09, indicators for whether
an individual has diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, and location fixed effects. Confidence
intervals are calculated using standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity.

This table presents the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression coefficient estimates (with robust standard errors in
parentheses) from analyses measuring the impact of implementation intentions prompts on influenza vaccination. In
columns (1)-(3), the outcome variable takes a value of one if the employee is vaccinated at a workplace clinic and a
value of zero otherwise. In columns (4)-(5), the outcome variable takes a value of one if we observe the employee
receiving an influenza vaccination at any site (by attending a workplace clinic or by submitting an insurance claim
for receiving a vaccination elsewhere) and a value of zero otherwise. All subjects are included in the regression
sample for column (1), while the regression sample is restricted to PPO members for columns (2)-(5). *, **, and ***
indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

This table presents the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression coefficient estimates (with robust standard errors in
parentheses) from analyses measuring the impact of implementation intentions prompts on influenza vaccination at
sites that offered flu shot clinics on only one day. In columns (6)-(8), the outcome variable takes a value of one if the
employee is vaccinated at a workplace clinic and a value of zero otherwise. In columns (9)-(10), the outcome
variable takes a value of one if we observe the employee receiving an influenza vaccination at any site (by attending
a workplace clinic or by submitting an insurance claim for receiving a vaccination elsewhere) and a value of zero
otherwise. All subjects with access to one-day flu shot clinics are included in the regression sample for column (6),
while the regression sample is restricted to PPO members with access to one-day flu shot clinics for columns (7)(10). *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
