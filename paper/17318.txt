How Reliable are De Facto Exchange Rate Regime Classifications?
Barry Eichengreen and Raul Razo-Garcia
NBER Working Paper No. 17318
August 2011
JEL No. F0,F31
ABSTRACT
We analyze disagreements over de facto exchange-rate-regime classifications using three popular de
facto regime data series. While there is a moderate degree of concurrence across classifications, disagreements
are not uncommon, and they are not random. They are most prevalent in middle-income countries
(emerging markets) and low-income (developing) countries as opposed to advanced economies. They
are most prevalent for countries with well-developed financial markets, low reserves and open capital
accounts. This suggests caution when attempting to relate the exchange rate regime to financial development,
the openness of the financial account, and reserve management and accumulation decisions.

Introduction

Since the breakdown of Bretton Woods, a large literature has developed around the choice
of exchange rate regime. One strand, drawing on the theory of optimum currency areas, asks why countries adopt the exchange rate regime they do (see Honkapohja and
Pikkarainen 1992, Rizzo 1998, and Edwards 1999). Another explores the implications of
that choice for real and financial variables such as interest rate volatility, business cycle
co-movements, real exchange rate variability and financial stability (see Mussa 1986, Baxter and Stockman 1989, and Hausmann, Gavin, Pages-Serra, and Stein 1989). It is fair
to say that these questions have come to constitute one of the principal preoccupations
of empirical international economists.
A limitation of the early literature is that it utilized the International Monetary Fund’s
de jure classification of exchange rate regimes.1 As published in the Fund’s Annual Report
on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, this index summarized countries’
self-reported exchange rate regimes. The problem was gaps between officially reported and
actually prevailing exchange rate arrangements. An example is the case of a government
seeking to keep its exchange rate pegged and reporting the de jure regime accordingly but
ultimately unable or unwilling to maintain its peg.2 Alternatively, countries officially committed to flexible exchange rates might exhibit fear of floating (Calvo and Reinhart 2002);
they might intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit actual variability. Either
way, the implications for studies of choice of exchange rate regime and its consequences
are not happy.
These observations have given rise to attempts to classify countries according to actual
practice – to identify the de facto exchange rate regime – of which Bubula and ÖtkerRobe (2002), Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) and Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2005) are
prominent examples. Reinhart and Rogoff (RR) divide their observations into those in
which a country has a unified exchange rate versus dual or parallel rates.3 For countries
with only official rates they then use statistical methods to verify the accuracy of the
de jure classification and/or place the observation into an alternative category, relying
1
A minority of the literature instead utilized actual exchange rate volatility, variously measured, as a
proxy for the de facto regime (see Holden, Holden, and Suss 1979 and Bayoumi and Eichengreen 1997).
2
This is the case analyzed by Alesina and Wagner (2006).
3
Recently, Bubula and Ötker-Robe’s de facto classification has been extended further back to cover
the period since 1980 by Anderson (2009).

mainly on data on exchange rate variability, variability relative to officially-announced
bands, and observed inflation. For countries with dual and parallel rates they do likewise
on the basis of the market-determined rate. Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (LYS), for their
part, classify exchange rate regimes on the basis of the volatility of the nominal exchange
rate, the variability of its rate of change, and the volatility of international reserves.
Bubula, Ötker-Robe and Anderson (BORA) utilize actual exchange rates supplemented by
information from IMF country reports and related sources (“press reports, news articles,
and other relevant papers”).
These studies are widely cited, and the series on de facto exchange rate regimes they
provide have been widely used. It is unsettling, therefore, that they do not agree. Countries classified as maintaining a fixed exchange rate by one set of investigators are sometimes classified as floating by another, and vice versa. This follows from the fact that
different authors use different variables in their algorithms for classifying countries, attach
different weights to different series, and employ different degrees of judgment. Since it is
not always clear why countries are classified as they are, it is not always clear why the
alternative series differ. These questions about the reliability of de facto exchange rate
classifications in turn raise questions about the reliability of studies utilizing them. To
illustrate the point, we show in Appendix B that earlier studies of the impact of the exchange rate regimes on, inter alia, economic growth and financial instability are sensitive
to the particular de facto exchange rate regime classification employed.
But while the existence of disagreements is well known, their extent and incidence are
not. Our goal in this paper is therefore to document and analyze the extent and nature of
disagreements among alternative de facto exchange rate regime classifications. We consider the Reinhart-Rogoff, Levy-Yeyati-Sturzenegger and Bubula-Ötker-Robe-Anderson
classifications. We assemble two-way tables to study correspondences between the schemes.
We test whether classifications are effectively independent using a Chi-square test and provide a statistical measure of the extent of agreement. We then use mixed-probit models
in which an unobservable propensity to disagree is related to a vector of economic and
financial covariates to identify the sources of disagreements.
While the different classifications are not independent according to our Chi-square
tests (de facto regime classifications are not randomly assigned), the extent of agreement

2

is fair to moderate, not substantial.4 In a non-negligible number of cases the discrepancy
is large: countries classified as operating a peg by one set of authors are described as
freely floating by another, and vice versa.
Importantly, discrepancies are not random. They are greater among middle-income
(emerging markets) and low-income (developing) countries than high-income (advanced)
countries. Some high-income countries like the United States have had floating exchange
rates for years and intervene sparingly in foreign exchange markets, while others have
operated well-specified pegs (European countries under the European Monetary System,
for example). Ample institutional detail results in a relatively high degree of agreement
across classifications. The same is not always true of emerging markets and developing
countries. It is when analyzing these countries that users of de facto exchange rate regime
classifications need to exercise particular caution.
We also find that disagreements tend to be clustered in periods of currency volatility.
Periods of high volatility often coincide with crises and changes in exchange rate regime.
This suggests that investigators should exercise special caution when relating the de facto
exchange rate regime to financial crises.5
We further find that de jure classifications are an important source of disagreement on
how to classify exchange rate regimes in emerging markets and developing countries. This
is true even when we control for other economic and financial characteristics of countries.
Evidently, the fact that some investigators constructing de facto classifications rely more
heavily than others on the IMF’s de jure classification leads to disagreements.
Finally, we find that the disagreement among alternative classifications is greatest for
countries with relatively well developed financial markets and low reserves. The openness
of the financial account is also an important source of disagreements between some classifications. This suggests caution when attempting to relate choice of exchange rate regime
to financial development, openness of the financial account, and reserve-management decisions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we study correspondences
among de facto classifications and measure the extent of agreement using Kappa statistics
and Chi-square tests. Section 3 presents the mixed-probit model and results. In Section

pegs, intermediate regimes and flexible rates. Final remarks are in Section 5.

Data Analysis

Different studies distinguish different exchange rate regimes. A first step in comparing
alternative schemes is thus to collapse the larger number of categories into a consistent set:
pegs, intermediate regimes, and floats, reflecting the traditional tripartite categorization.
Previous studies provide a good deal of guidance about how to go about this, and there
is broad agreement about where to draw the lines.6 It could be, however, that collapsing
a larger number of categories spuriously introduces disagreements by placing the dividing
line between pegs, floats and intermediate regimes at incompatible points. It will be
important therefore to check that our findings are robust to different dividing lines.7
Combining market exchange rates and other series with assessments of the nature
of the exchange rate regime drawn from consultations with member countries and IMF
country desk economists, Bubula, Ötker-Robe and Anderson distinguish thirteen exchange
rate arrangements. We collapse their thirteen categories into hard pegs, intermediate and
floating regimes following Eichengreen and Razo-Garcia (2006). Our definition of hard
pegs includes regimes that use another currency as legal tender, currency union, currency
board, and economic union or monetary coordination agreement (see Table 1). Intermediate regimes include conventional fixed pegs to a single currency, conventional fixed pegs to
a basket, pegs within a horizontal band, forward-looking crawling pegs, forward-looking
crawling bands, backward-looking crawling pegs, backward-looking crawling bands, and
tightly managed floating. Floating regimes include other managed floats and independently floats.8
When there are multiple exchange rates, Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) use information
from informal (black or parallel) markets to identify exchange rate arrangements. They
argue that market-determined dual or parallel markets are important, if not better, indicators of the underlying monetary policy. We map their fourteen categories into pegs,
6

For discussion see Eichengreen and Razo-Garcia (2006).
In particular, we will want to consider dividing lines that maximize the concordance between different
series.

This classification has been updated by IMF staff through 2008.

intermediate regimes and floats as follows.9 Hard pegs comprise categories 1 through 3
in Reinhart and Rogoff’s (2004) classification: no separate legal tender, pre-announced
pegs or currency boards, and pre-announced horizontal bands narrower than, or equal to,
plus/minus 2%. Soft pegs consist of categories 4 through 11: de facto pegs, pre-announced
crawling pegs, pre-announced crawling bands narrower than, or equal, to +/-2%, de facto
crawling pegs, de facto crawling bands narrower than, or equal to, +/-2%, pre-announced
crawling bands wider than, or equal, to +/-2%, de facto crawling bands narrower than, or
equal to, +/-5%, and moving bands narrower than, or equal to, +/-2% (i.e., allowing for
both appreciation and depreciation over time). Floats include two categories: managed
floating and freely floating. The observations in Reinhart and Rogoff’s “freely falling”
category are reclassified using their detailed chronologies.10
Finally, Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2005) assume that pegs are associated with
low volatility of exchange rates (in levels and changes) and high volatility of international
reserves, while floating regimes are characterized by volatile exchange rates (in levels and
changes) and stable international reserves. They use cluster analysis to distinguish five
arrangements: 1) inconclusive; 2) floats; 3) dirty floats; 4) crawling pegs; and 5) pegs.11
We count categories 3, 4 and some of the regimes in category 5 as intermediate regimes
(see Table 1).

9

See Table 1.
A country’s exchange rate regime is classified as “freely falling” when the 12-month inflation rate
is equal to or exceeds 40% in one year, or the six months following an exchange rate crisis where the
crisis marked a movement from a peg or an intermediate regime to a floating regime (managed or freely
floating). For more details on this classification, see the Appendix in Reinhart and Rogoff (2004).
11
A country’s ER arrangement is classified as “inconclusive” when the volatility of the ER and the
volatility of international reserves are low. In their latest update, less than 2% of regimes were classified
as “inconclusive.” Since we could not re-classify these observations into pegs, intermediate or floating
regimes they are left out of the analysis.

Contingency Tables

Reinhart and Rogoff vs Bubula, Ötker-Robe and Anderson
Table 2 presents two-way tables for the three pairs of de facto classifications. In panel A
we combine the data for advanced, emerging market and developing countries. Panel B
restricts the sample to emerging markets, panel C to advanced countries, and panel D to
developing countries.
Panel A shows that RR and BORA agree on 69% of observations.12 Floating regimes
display the highest discrepancy, followed by soft pegs and then hard pegs. While more
than half of floating rates in BORA are classified as intermediate regimes by RR, a bit less
than 50% floating rates in RR are classified as intermediate regimes by BORA. Roughly
a fourth of intermediate regimes in RR are classified as hard pegs or floating rates by
BORA, and about a third of soft pegs in BORA are classified as either hard pegs or
flexible rates by RR. Highlighting the scope of potential disagreement is the fact that 21
hard pegs in RR are classified as floats by BORA.
These patterns differ across emerging markets, advanced and developing countries. For
example, hard pegs appear to be less difficult to identify in advanced countries than emerging markets and developing countries (first matrix in Panels B, C and D). In emerging
markets, whereas half of all floating regimes in BORA (RR) are classified as intermediate
regimes by RR (BORA), 23% (20%) of intermediate regimes in BORA (RR) are classified
as floating by RR (BORA).
Both classifications exhibit a higher degree of correspondence for advanced countries.
Approximately 16% (22%) of intermediate regimes in BORA (RR) are classified as floats
by RR (BORA). It would appear that hard pegs are especially difficult to identify in
developing countries: 26% of hard pegs in RR are classified as intermediate regimes or
floating by BORA.
Analyzing changes in the contingency tables over time, there is evidence of increasing
agreement about hard pegs and floats but declining agreement about intermediate regimes.
BORA identify fewer intermediate regimes in relatively recent years, while RR do not.13
The number of observations classified as intermediate by RR and floating by BORA has
12

Out of 3857 regimes, RR and BORA agree in 837 hard pegs, 1392 intermediates and 421 floats.
While more than 70% of the regimes classified in 1980 by BORA were soft pegs, in 2007 this proportion
reduced to 40%.

risen rather than falling over time.14 Finally, the number of regimes classified as hard
pegs by RR and intermediate by BORA fell in the 1980s and remained roughly constant
thereafter.
Panel A in Figure 1 shows the proportion of observations for which the two classifications agree. The concordance between these two schemes improved from 1980 to 1985
and has since then remained more or less constant at 70%.

Reinhart and Rogoff vs Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger
RR and LYS agree on 60% of regimes (second matrix in Panel A of Table 2), fewer than
RR and BORA. 41% of hard pegs in RR are classified as intermediate or floating regimes
by LYS. While 60% of RR’s flexible regimes are classified as soft pegs by LYS, 59% of
floats in LYS are classified as intermediate arrangements by RR. Evidently, intermediate
regimes are specially hard for these two sets of investigators to agree on. Of the 2073
intermediate arrangements in LYS, 538 (26%) are classified as hard pegs and 433 (21%)
as floats by RR, while of the 1560 soft pegs in RR 443 (28%) are grouped as floats by
LYS. RR thus classify many more observations as hard pegs and considerably fewer as
intermediate regimes.
Results are similar for emerging markets and developing countries (second matrix in
Panels B and D of Table 2). Quite a few cases classified as hard pegs by RR are classified
as intermediates by LYS. Similarly, not a few arrangements classified as intermediates
by one scheme are categorized as flexible by the other. For advanced economies (second
matrix in Panel D), there is more agreement.
The main change over time is increased agreement about hard pegs. There is also
a declining number of cases in which RR=floating and LYS=intermediate regime. In
contrast, the number of observations classified as intermediate by RR and as floating by
LYS rises with time.
Panel B in Figure 1 shows changes over time in the fraction of arrangements on which
the two classifications agree. Contrary to the lack of improvement in the extent of agreement between RR and BORA, the concordance between RR and LYS rises with time:
whereas RR and LYS agreed on 55% of the observations in the 1980s, they agree on more

than two thirds of regimes in 2004.15

Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger vs Bubula, Ötker-Robe and Anderson
LYS and BORA agree on 75% of regimes (third matrix in Panel A of Table 2), higher than
any other pair.16 Intermediate and floating regimes are again the most difficult on which
to agree. While more than 50% of regimes classified as flexible by BORA are classified as
intermediates by LYS, 46% of floats in LYS are classified as intermediate arrangements
by BORA. Of 1914 intermediate arrangements in LYS, 112 (6%) are classified as hard
pegs and 386 (20%) as flexible regimes by BORA, while of the 1741 soft pegs in BORA,
321 observations (18%) are classed as floats by LYS. BORA classify more regimes as both
hard pegs and floats than LYS.
For emerging markets and advanced countries, LYS and BORA agree on almost all
hard pegs. However, they show less agreement about intermediate regimes and floats
(third matrix in Panels B and C in Table 2). They have also difficulty in agreeing on
regimes in developing countries more generally (Panel D in Table 2).
The two classifications exhibit a higher degree of correspondence over time on hard
pegs and floating regimes but not on intermediate regimes.17 Overall, panel C in Figure
1 shows a decline in the degree of agreement between LYS and BORA from 1980 to 1994
followed by a rise back up to earlier levels around 2004.

Robustness Checks
We perform two robustness checks. First, to see whether the results are driven by differences in sample periods we assemble a three-way table limited to the period common to
all three schemes (1980-2004).18 We still find large-off diagonal cells, which indicates that
disagreements are not driven by differences in sample period.19
Second, we check whether disagreements are mainly due to discrepancies in timing.
15

The reason is that both classifications have agreed more in terms of hard pegs over time.
667 arrangements were classified as hard pegs, 1416 as intermediates, and 369 as floating regimes by
both schemes.
17
The number of observations classified as floats by BORA and as intermediate regimes by LYS has
increased over time. In particular, it appears that LYS classifications has problems to identify regime in
periods of macroeconomic distress.
18
Available from the authors upon request.
19
By construction, the three-way table limits the analysis to those observations for which we have the
three classifications.
16

9

To do this we compute the proportion of the off-diagonal cells where one of the two regime
classifications changed in year t, creating a disagreement that did not exist in year t − 1,
and then the other classification changed in year t+1, making the disagreement go away.20
Only 2.9% of our recorded disagreements (off-diagonal cells) between RR and BORA are
due to this “one-year” discrepancy.21 Although higher ratios are observed for the other
two pairs, 7% for RR-LYS and 15% for BORA-LYS, here too it remains that our results
are not mainly driven by disagreements in the timing of exchange rate regime shifts.

2.2

Independence (Chi-Square) Tests

In Table 3 we test whether two de facto classifications are independent using the Chisquare (χ2 ) statistic22
X X Oij − Eij
χ2 =
Eij
i
j

2

where Oij is the observed frequency for regime i in classification 1 and regime j in classification 2, and Eij is the expected frequency for the cell corresponding to the ith regime in
the first classification and the j th arrangement in the second scheme.23 The null hypothesis is rejected if this statistic exceeds the critical value obtained from the χ2 distribution
with m degrees of freedom.24 In all cases the null of independence is rejected, supporting
the hypothesis that the three classifications are related.

20

For example, RR identify an intermediate regime for Sweden in 1992 while BORA identify a float.
In this specific example, the disagreement between the two classifications is due to a disagreement in the
timing of an exchange rate regime change: BORA identify a switch from a soft peg to a floating regime
in 1992 and RR in 1993.
21
This ratio also includes cases in which BORA changed in year t, creating a disagreement that did
not exist in the previous year, and then in period t + 1 this changed is reversed.
22
For example, for the pair RR-BORA under the null hypothesis Pr (RR=Hard Peg|BORA=Hard
Peg)=Pr (RR=Hard Peg|BORA=Intermediate)=Pr (RR=Hard Peg|BORA=Floating)=Pr(RR=Hard
Peg).
23
The χ2 test is inappropriate if any expected frequency is below 1 or if the expected frequency is less
than 5 in more than 20% of the cells. Had this been the case, we would have to combine rows or columns.
24
The degrees of freedom are equal to (3-1)·(3-1).

Analysis of the Correspondence using Kappa Statistics

The Kappa Statistic (Cohen, 1960) is scaled to be 0 when the extent of agreement is what
would be observed by chance and 1 when there is perfect agreement. For intermediate
cases, Landis and Koch (1977) suggest the interpretations in Table 4.
Let m be the number of “raters” and k the number of regimes. For two “raters,” m = 2,
define wij (i = 1, . . . , k, j = 1, . . . , k) as the weights for agreement and disagreement.

If RR and BORA had classified regimes randomly with probabilities equal to the
overall proportions, we would expect the two classifications to agree on 38% of regimes.
In fact they agree on 69%, 49% of the way between random and perfect agreement. From
this we conclude that the strength of agreement is moderate (see Table 4) and reject the
null that RR and BORA are classifying regimes randomly. Advanced countries exhibit
the highest degree of correspondence (64% of the way between random agreement and
perfect agreement), followed by developing countries (46%) and emerging markets (42%).
The strength of agreement between RR and LYS is similarly moderate. These two
classifications agree on 60% observations, 36% of the way between random and perfect
agreement. Advanced countries exhibit the highest degree of agreement (54%), followed
by developing countries (33%) and emerging countries (21%).
BORA and LYS agree on 75% observations, 58% of the way between random and
perfect agreement. Again this is a moderate level of agreement. However, advanced and
developing countries exhibit a substantial degree of agreement: 63% and 61%, respectively.25
In Figure 2 we show the Kappa Statistic over time. RR and BORA exhibit rising
agreement over time. The same rising trend is evident for the RR-LYS pair but not for
LYS-BORA Again, we can observe that the two pairs including LYS classification show
a jump in the Kappa Statistic around 1994. For the pair BORA-LYS, for example, the
degree of agreement changes from moderate to fair from 1993 to 1994.
Predictably, agreement is lower still when we compute the combined Kappa Statistic
for the three classifications (m = 3). Let αni be the number of ratings on observation nth

Mixed Probit Models

In this section we estimate mixed-probit models to analyze how economic and institutional
factors affect the probability of agreement.

3.1

Definition of the Discrete Variables

Let RRit , BORAit and LY Sit be the exchange rate regime of country i in period t obtained
from Reinhart and Rogoff; Bubula, Ötker-Robe and Anderson; and Levy-Yeyati and
Sturzenegger classifications, respectively. Formally,



HP if ERR by Y is a hard peg


Yit =
I
if ERR by Y is an intermediate regime



 F
if ERR by Y is a floating regime
where Y = {RR, BORA, LY S}.
For each pair of classifications X and Z, for X = {RR, BORA}, Z = {BORA, LY S}
and X 6= Z, we define 3 dummy variables. The first, DX>Z , captures whether macroeconomic and institutional factors affect the probability of observing a more flexible regime in
classification X relative to the regime in classification Z; X > Z (e.g. RR=Intermediate
and BORA= Hard Peg). DitZ>X , the second binary variable, analyzes the opposite case;

17

observations in which classification Z implies a more flexible arrangement than classification X (Z > X). The third variable, DitX6=Z , is used to investigate what factors
systematically affect the probability of observing different regimes in X and Z de facto
classifications (the off-diagonal elements of the two-way table). Formally, these three
variables are defined as

DitX>Z


 1 if X > Z
it
it
=
 0 if X = Z
it
it

This dummy variable is related to the lower-triangular elements of the contingency tables.

DitZ>X


 1 if X < Z
it
it
=
 0 if X = Z
it
it

This dummy variable is related to the upper-triangular elements of the contingency table.

DitX6=Z


 1 if X 6= Z
it
it
=
 0 if X = Z
it
it

This dummy variable is related to the off diagonal elements of the two-way tables.
For each of these three dummy variables we propose a discrete choice model in which
an unobservable measure of disagreement is defined as
Dit∗Λ = Xit0 β Λ + αi + it

(6)

where Λ = {X > Z, Z > X, X 6= Z}, D∗Λ is an unobservable latent index describing
the likelihood of observing event Λ, Xit is a vector of exogenous regressors, β is a vector
of parameters associated with Xit , αi is a country-specific random effect affecting the
probability of event Λ (assumed to be i.i.d. normally distributed with mean zero and
variance σα2 ), and it is a random term representing all the factors affecting D∗Λ not
included in X. We assume that the probability density function of it is the standard
normal distribution (it ∼ N (0, 1)). Although D∗Λ cannot be observed, we observe the
three discrete variables defined above.28
28

Initially we defined two extra dummy variables to deal with two of the off-diagonal elements of the
two-way tables with more disagreements, entries (2,3) and (3,2). For the sake of brevity we exclude

18

3.2

Explanatory Variables

We define Flexible de Jure as a dummy variable equal to one if the IMF de jure classification signifies a float and Intermediate de Jure as a binary variable equal to one if the
IMF de jure classification denotes a soft peg.29
Other independent variables are inflation, per capita income, M2/GDP as a proxy for
financial development, reserves (normalized by M2), trade openness ( exports+imports
), size,
GDP
degree of democratization, financial openness, and two binary variables denoting advanced
or emerging market countries. We also include the volatility of the nominal exchange rate
defined as the standard deviation of the monthly change of the (log) nominal exchange
rate over the preceding five years. All explanatory variables, except for the dummies and
the democracy measure, are lagged one year.

3.3

Results

Table 7 uses data for advanced, emerging market and developing countries, Table 8 for
emerging markets only, and Table 9 for advanced countries only.30 The first three columns
present the results for RR-BORA, columns (4)-(6) for RR-LYS, and columns (7)-(9) for
BORA-LYS.
The results suggest that inflation, international reserves, financial openness, financial
development, per capita income, intermediate and flexible de jure are significant sources of
disagreement over how to classify exchange rate regimes. Inflation significantly increases
the likelihood of disagreements. The coefficient on this variable is significantly different
from zero at conventional confidence levels in five of the nine models estimated. The
results suggest that higher inflation increases the likelihood of disagreements between RR
and BORA and between BORA and LYS but not between RR and LYS to the same
extent. Specifically, inflation increases the chances of observing a flexible regime in RR
the results obtained with these two variables because they are similar to the findings obtained with
X>Z
Z>X
models Dit
and Dit
. We do not define dummy variables for the combinations of X=hard peg and
Y =flexible (entry [3,1]), Z=flexible and X= hard peg (entry [1,3]), and Z=hard peg and X=intermediate
(entry [2,1]) because there are not enough observations to identify the coefficients.
29
Since Hard peg de Jure+Intermediate de Jure+Flexible de Jure=1, then, in some models Flexible de
Jure or Intermediate de Jure is dropped off when one of these three binary variables is equal to zero for
all the observations included in that model (e.g. Intermediate de Jure+Flexible de Jure=1). In some
extreme cases both variables, Intermediate de Jure and Flexible de Jure, are dropped off because one of
those variables is equal to one for all the observations included in that model.
30
A table presenting the results for developing countries is included in the Appendix (Table 14).

19

relative to BORA and LYS (models 1 and 4) and in BORA relative to LYS (model 7).
This plausibly reflects the fact that LYS’s cluster analysis relies exclusively on reserves
and the nominal exchange rate to identify the regimes while the other two schemes use
additional information on, inter alia, prices.
The size and significance of the coefficients associated with inflation also differ across
advanced, emerging and developing countries. Among emerging markets, the probability
of disagreement increases with inflation in five of the nine models; however, in only one
of them is statistically significant (model 4 in Table 8). For advanced countries, inflation
is positive and significant in four of the nine models (Table 9). In high-income countries
inflation becomes positive and significant in models (2) and (5), implying that in advanced
countries with high inflation, BORA and LYS are likely to classify an exchange rate regime
as more flexible than RR. This is plausibly due to the fact RR use inflation to classify
regimes whereas LYS does not.
Per capita income, which plausibly proxies for the strength of institutions, negatively
affects the probability of disagreement in six of the nine models. In three of these six
models the coefficient is different from zero at conventional levels (models 1, 5 and 8 in
Table 7). Per capita income lowers the probability of identifying a more flexible regime
in RR than BORA (model 1), the likelihood of observing a more flexible regime in LYS
relative to RR (model 5), and the probability that exchange rate arrangement identified
by LYS is more flexible than BORA (model 8). Other things equal, RR are more likely
classify a regime as more flexible than LYS in higher per capita income countries (model
4). Similarly, per capita income raises the probability of identifying a more flexible regime
in BORA than RR (model 2).31
There is also some evidence that disagreements are more prevalent in more financially
developed economies, where financial development is proxied by the M2/GDP ratio. But
this effect is limited to the RR-BORA and RR-LYS pairs. M2/GDP is positive and
significant in three models (Table 7, models 2, 3 and 4), indicating that the cases in
which RR identify a more flexible regime than LYS, and BORA a more flexible than RR
are more prevalent in countries with relatively well developed financial markets (models
2 and 4). In contrast, having a more developed financial system reduces the probability
31

Just a few of these results survive when we re-estimate the models using only emerging markets data.
On the contrary, the majority of these findings hold when we use data from high-income countries.

20

of identifying a more flexible regime by RR relative to BORA (model 1).
Results here differ between emerging markets and advanced countries, however. In the
estimates for emerging markets, while two significant coefficients associated with M2/GDP
in Table 7 (models 2 and 4) are not longer significant in Table 8, two of the insignificant
coefficients in Table 7 become statistically different from zero at conventional levels in the
emerging market subsample (Table 8, models 5 and 6). An emerging market having a
more developed financial sector increases the probability that LYS will classify a regime
as more flexible than RR. In the advanced country subsample, M2/GDP is no longer
significant in model (4), but it becomes significant in models (5), and (6). The most
striking differences are in the magnitude of the coefficients associated with M2/GDP in
models (3), (6) and (9). These positive coefficients again indicate that the development
of financial markets increases the probability of a disagreement.
Similarly, disagreements are greater for countries with low international reserves, as
proxied by the reserves/M2 ratio. All the coefficients associated with international reserves are negative. There is a negative correlation, for example, between international
reserves and the probability of identifying a more flexible regime by RR relative to BORA
and LYS (models 1 and 4) and the likelihood that LYS will classify a regime as more flexible than RR and BORA (models 5 and 8). This might seem counterintuitive given the
build-up of foreign exchange reserves in emerging markets and the fact that we still observe many off-diagonal entries different from zero in Panel B of Table 2. In Table 8 we
therefore re-estimate the models including only emerging markets. Although the coefficients on reserves mostly remain negative, only two of them are statistically significant
at conventional significance levels. We find very different results for advanced countries
(Table 9). In high-income countries, in contrast, high international reserves consistently
raise the probability of disagreement.
There is evidence, in addition, that financial openness is related to the probability of
disagreement. But this evidence is stronger for the RR-BORA and RR-LYS pairs than
for BORA-LYS. This may reflect the fact that RR use data on black market rates for
financially closed economies, whereas the other two do not. While model (3) in Table 7
suggests that for financially-open economies the likelihood of a disagreement between RR
and BORA is high, model (6) indicates that financial openness decreases the likelihood

21

of disagreements between RR and LYS. These results are mainly driven by the fact that
financial-openness raises the probability that BORA classify a regime as more flexible than
RR (model 2) and decreases the likelihood of RR classifying a regime as more flexible than
LYS (model 4). For the BORA-LYS pair, we find that the probability of BORA classifying
a regime as more flexible than LYS raises with the degree of financial account openness
(model 7).32
Differences in reliance on de jure classifications also appear to be an important source
of disagreement. A de jure floating regime, for example, increases the likelihood that
BORA will classify a regime as more flexible than RR (model 2) and LYS (model 7), the
probability of finding a more flexible regime in LYS relative to RR (model 5), and the
likelihood of RR classifying a regime as more flexible than LYS (model 4). Evidently,
some investigators (e.g. BORA) rely more on the IMF’s de jure classification than others,
and this leads to a significant number of disagreements. Most of these results hold when
the model is re-estimated using only data from advanced countries or emerging markets.
Similarly, the presence of a de jure intermediate regime raises the probability that RR
will identify the regime as a float while BORA classify it as intermediate (model 1) and
likelihood that LYS classify a regime as more flexible than RR (model 5). For BORA-LYS
pair, the three coefficients in models (7)-(9) are positive and significantly different from
zero at conventional levels suggesting that the presence of a de jure intermediate regime
increases the off-diagonal entries of the two-way table associated with this pair.33
The coefficient associated with “democratic level” is significant in seven of the nine
models. While RR and BORA and RR and LYS are less likely to disagree over more
democratic countries (models 3 and 6 in Table 7), BORA and LYS tend to disagree more
(model 9). In particular, democratic countries exhibit a lower probability of identifying
a more flexible regime by RR relative to BORA and LYS (models 1 and 4), a lower
likelihood that BORA will classify a regime as more flexible than RR (model 2), and
higher likelihood of observing a more flexible regime in LYS than BORA (model 7).
Similar results are obtained for the emerging market subsample. In contrast, in advanced
countries with highly democratic political systems the three de facto classifications are
32

These results hold in the advanced and emerging market sub-samples.
Some of these results survive in the emerging market and advance countries sub-samples, however,
in some cases there de jure intermediate regime was not linearly independent of de jure flexible regime
so we drop it from the regression.

less likely to disagree (Table 9).
Exchange rate volatility is also associated with discrepancies among BORA and LYS
classifications. This variable enters as significantly different from zero in column 8 of
Table 7. While all three sets of authors use this variable in constructing their classifications, periods of volatility are also periods when regimes change, making classification
particularly difficult. Finally, while economic size does not affect the probability of a
disagreement when we estimate these equations on the full sample (Table 7), it does help
to explain discrepancies for emerging markets. Specifically, disagreements among de facto
classifications are less likely in the cases of larger emerging markets.

Alternative Configurations

We now check the robustness of our findings with respect to different dividing lines between pegs, intermediate regimes and flexible rates. Specifically, we consider what dividing
lines maximize the concordance between the three schemes by maximizing the combined
Kappa Statistic. This requires analyzing 10,710 different ways of collapsing the 13 categories in Reinhart and Rogoff, the 14 regimes in Bubula, Ötker-Robe and Anderson, and
the 5 categories in Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger into pegged, intermediate and floating
arrangements.34
34

Considering all potential ways of collapsing the three de facto classifications would infeasible (i.e.
too many combinations and high computational cost) and some combinations in any case would not
make sense. For that reason we only consider 7, 34 and 45 different ways of collapsing the 5 regimes in
Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger, the 13 categories in Reinhart and Rogoff, and the 14 regimes in Bubula,
Ötker-Robe and Anderson into pegs, intermediate and floats, respectively (10,710=7*34*45). Let Yl be
the category l in classification Y (= {RR, BORA, LY S}) with l = 13 for Reinhart and Rogoff, l = 14
for Bubula,Ötker-Robe and Abderson and l = 5 for Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger. The most important
constraint we impose to make our analysis feasible and consistent is the following: if category Ym implies
a lower degree of flexibility than Yn (e.g BORAm =currency board and Yn =pegged within horizontal
bands) then Ym cannot be assigned into a more flexible regime (e.g. float) than Yn (e.g. intermediate).

Notes: All the models are estimated using random effects. Standard Errors in parenthesis.
In models (1), (4)-(9) Intermediate De Jure is not linearly independent of Flexible De Jure and Hard Peg De Jure.

The configuration maximizing the combined Kappa Statistic is shown in Table 10. The
only differences from the configuration used above are that: 1) Pre announced horizontal
bands narrower than or equal to +/-2% in Reinhart and Rogoff are now counted as
intermediate regimes rather than hard pegs; 2) Managed floating in Reinhart and Rogoff
is now categorized as an intermediate regime rather than floating; and 3) Managed floating
with no predetermined path for the exchange rate in Bubula, Ötker-Robe and Anderson
is counted as an intermediate regime rather than floating.
The combined Kappa-statistic, in Table 11, rises by 7%, from 0.4588 to 0.4905. Relative to the two-way statistics shown in Table 5, the degree of agreement for all countries
increases for the three pairs (Table 12). But while the concordance between RR and
BORA increases for emerging markets and developing countries, it falls for advanced
countries. Agreement between RR and LYS rises for high-income (advanced) and lowincome (developing) countries and keeps constant for emerging markets. The strength of
agreement between BORA and LYS falls for advanced countries and emerging markets
but increases for developing economies.
25

Comparing the two-way tables in Tables 2 and 13, we see that the now higher degree of agreement across classifications is reflected mainly in greater agreement about
intermediate regimes.

35

We also find more agreement about floats. Arithmetically, the decline in the proportion
of flexible arrangements in RR (-13%) and BORA (-11%) is greater than the decline in the
proportion of observations on which both classifications identify a floating regime (-7%).36
Panel A of Table 13 also shows that agreement is more extensive with this new configuration because of fewer observations in the larger off-diagonal cells (cells [2,3] and
[3,2] of the two-way tables). The number of observations in cell (3,2) of the two-way
table associated with RR and BORA, RR=flexible and BORA=intermediate falls from
385 to 182. Similarly, the number of observations in cell (2,3), RR=intermediate and
BORA=flexible, falls from 466 to 322. While the entry (3,2) in the two-way table of RR
and LYS falls from 433 to 111, the cell (2,3), RR=intermediate and LYS=flexible, rises
only from 443 to 584. Thus, the rise in (2,3) is more than offset by the decline in (3,2),
implying a higher degree of agreement between RR and LYS. The strength of agreement
between BORA and LYS rises due to the fact that the decrease in entry (3,2) more than
offsets the increase in cell (2,3).
While agreement between RR and BORA is higher with this new configuration for
emerging markets and developing countries, it is lower for advanced countries. The improvement in the concordance between RR and BORA for emerging markets and developing countries is caused by an increase in agreement about intermediate regimes and a fall
in the number of observations classified as intermediate by one scheme and flexible by the
other (cells [2,3] and [3,2]). The lower agreement between RR and BORA for advanced
35

This change is driven by an increase in the number of intermediate regimes in both RR and BORA
and by the fact that agreement about intermediate regimes increases more, as a percentage of the total
number of regimes, than the fraction of intermediate arrangements in RR and BORA.For example,
agreement about intermediate regimes in RR and BORA increases to 2018 or 52% of the all the regimes
in this new configuration of exchange rate arrangements (Panel A Table 13) from 1392 or 36% of all the
arrangements (Panel A Table 2). This increase of 16 percentage points is greater than the increase in
the number of arrangements identified as intermediate regimes in RR (13%) or BORA (11%). With the
new dividing lines there are 434 (11%) more intermediate regimes in BORA, relative to the configuration
presented in Table 1 and 483 (13%) more soft pegs in RR. The number of hard pegs, intermediate and
floating regimes does not change in LYS because the diving lines between categories is the same in Tables
2 and 13.
36
We obtain these numbers from Tables 2 and 13. The proportion of floating regimes decreases from
21% to 8% in RR and from 23% to 12% in BORA. While in Table 2 RR and BORA agree on 421 floating
regimes, the two schemes agree on 144 with the new configuration (Table 13).

26

countries is due to the increase in cell (2,3).
With the new configuration, the Kappa statistic associated with RR-LYS classifications remains constant for emerging markets while rising for advanced and developing countries. Greater agreement about soft pegs and fewer observations in cell (3,2),
RR=Flexible and LYS=Intermediate, drive the rise in agreement between RR and LYS
classifications for high- and low-income economies.37 In contrast, the concordance between
BORA and LYS rises only for developing countries.
In sum, even when the correspondence across the three classifications is maximized
we still observe many disagreements, and the overall patterns described above continue
to obtain.

Final Remarks

In this paper we have analyzed disagreements between de facto exchange-rate-regime
classifications using data on three popular classification schemes. While there exists a
reasonable degree of concurrence across classifications, disagreements are not uncommon,
and they are not random. Disagreements are most prevalent in middle-income countries
(emerging markets) and low-income (developing) countries. Some are centered in periods
of currency volatility when the exchange-rate regime is prone to change. De jure classifications are also a source of disagreement on how to classify exchange rate practice in
emerging markets and developing countries, suggesting that different investigators rely on
them to differing extents. Disagreements are relatively prevalent for countries with welldeveloped financial markets and low reserves. Financial openness is also an important
source of disagreements between some de facto classifications.
The existence of disagreements among the popular de facto exchange-rate-regime classifications suggests caution when using them in empirical work. The incidence and correlates of those disagreements suggest particular caution when using them to analyze
exchange-rate regimes in emerging markets and developing countries. It suggests special
caution when attempting to relate the de facto exchange rate regime to financial stability, financial development, the openness of the financial account, and reserve management
37

For these type of countries the decrease in cell (3,2) is higher than the increase in the number of
regimes in cell (2,3). Therefore, the total number of observations in the off-diagonal cells decreases.

27

and accumulation decisions.
On a more positive note, these findings also point to the countries and country characteristics on which investigators should focus when refining existing de facto regime
classifications and constructing new ones.

B

Macroeconomic Performance, Banking Crises and
Exchange Rate Regime

In this section we estimate regressions that relate economic growth and the likelihood of
banking crises to the exchange rate regime. These illustrate and underscore our point
about the critical importance of differences across de facto exchange rate regime classifications for the conclusions drawn by researchers for a range of important empirical
questions.

B.1

Economic Growth

Following Ghosh, Gulde, and Wolf (2003) we study the relationship between per capita
real GDP growth and the exchange rate regime controlling for variables that capture
factor accumulation (investment/GDP and the average number of years of schooling of

34

the population) and catch-up effects (log of the ratio of the country’s per capita GDP to
that of the United States). Following their specification, trade openness, taxes as a share
of GDP, terms of trade growth (to control for terms of trade shocks), population growth
and population size are added to the regression:
∆y pc =β0 + β1 Investment/GDP + β2 T rade Openness + β3 ∆T OT + β4 Schooling+
β5 T ax ratio + β6 log(Initial Income/U.S. Income) + β7 P opulation Growth+
β8 log(P opulation) + β9 P egged Regimes + β10 Intermediate Regimes +  (7)
where ∆y pc is the per capital real GDP growth, ∆T OT denotes terms of trade growth
and Schooling the average years of schooling.
Table 15 presents the results. The first three columns show the estimated coefficients
for the benchmark model (equation 7) using the three de facto exchange rate regime
classifications. The next three columns add fixed effects to the benchmark model. Table
16 uses observations for emerging markets only, and Table 17 for advanced countries only.
With the exception of the tax ratio and the RR and BORA pegged regime dummies,
the other right-hand-side variables display the expected signs and are statistically significant at conventional levels of significance in the benchmark models. The key result
for present purposes is that the coefficients associated with the regime dummies exhibit
different signs across exchange rate regime classifications. While pegged and intermediate
regimes appear to spur economic growth when the LYS classification is used, the opposite
result is found when RR or BORA is utilized. Also, while the pegged and intermediate
regime dummies are both statistically significant when the LYS classification is used, only
the intermediate regime dummy is significant when RR or BORA are utilized. Similar
results are obtain when fixed effects are added.
In summary, results look different when one uses different de facto classifications.

B.2

Banking Crises

In this section we examine how the choice of exchange rate regime affects the probability
of a banking crisis.38 A probit model is proposed to estimate the effect of the exchange
38

Banking crises are identified as in Laeven and Valencia (2008). They define a systemic banking crisis
when the corporate and financial sectors of a country experience a large number of defaults and financial
institutions and corporations face great difficulties repaying contracts on time.

35

rate regime on that probability.
In this exercise we follow the empirical model proposed by Domac and Martinez Peria
(2003). The exchange rate regime and a vector of macroeconomic and financial variables
(the inflation rate, the level and growth of real GDP per capita, the change in the terms
of trade, the ratio of net capital flows to GDP, the ratio of domestic credit to GDP, the
growth of domestic credit, and the ratios of M2 to reserves and foreign liabilities to foreign
assets) are included as explanatory variables. Two binary variables, pegged regimes and
intermediate regimes, are then added to investigate the link between the exchange rate
regime and the probability of a banking crisis. The three de facto exchange rate regime
classification are again used to check the robustness of the results.
Table 18 reports the results. The first three columns use the three de facto classifications and data from advanced, developing and emerging market countries. Columns
(4)-(6) use data for emerging markets only, and columns (7)-(9) for advanced countries
only. The estimated coefficients associated with pegged and intermediate regimes are
strikingly different across de facto exchange rate regime classifications, again underscoring our point.
