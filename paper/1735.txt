Introduction

The automobile industry is perhaps the most outstanding example of

the Japanese competitive threat to North American manufacturing. The
Japanese production cost advantage has been estimated to be as high as
$2,000 per vehicle (Abernathy and Harbour (1981), Abernathy, Clark and

Kantrow (1983), Federal Trade Commission (1983)). These studies
attribute a substantial proportion of the cost advantage to superior
productivity performance by Japanese automobile manufacturers.
This paper differs from the earlier studies cited above in a number

of ways. First, we will be estimating comparative growth rates of unit
costs and productivity rather than comparing levels at a point in time.'
Second, previous studies of U.S.-Japanese automobile costs have been
essentially accounting studies, and have not employed more rigorous

analytical methods. In this study, we utilize an econometric cost
function and the decomposition analysis proposed by Denny and Fuss (1983)
to measure the growth in unit cost and productivity and to determine

the sources of growth. This methodology permits us to overcome two major
shortcomings of previous studies —

the inability to adequately

disentangle factor price effects from efficiency effects, and the

inability to account correctly for short-run disequilibrium. The source
of disequilibrium that we are concerned with in this paper is due to

variations in capacity utilization. Variations in capacity utilization
affect both unit costs and total factor productivity. Accounting for
capacity utilization effects is particularly crucial in the automobile
industry, an industry characterized by quasi—fixed factors (capital

and part of labour) and product-specific manufacturing facilities. Hence

2

swings in consumer tastes among different products can lead to variations
in capacity utilization which may greatly affect measured unit cost and

productivity growth. In fact, the empirical results presented below
indicate that long—run total factor productivity growth during the 1970's

would have been underestimated by 37% in the United States and 31% in

Canada had capacity utilization effects not been accounted for. This is
due primarily to the very low rates of capacity utilization in the North
American automobile industry in 1980, the last year of our sample.
Even after correcting for capacity utilization differences, the
Japanese productivity "miracle" is evident from our results for

automobile production. During the 1970's total factor productivity in
the Japanese automobile industry grew at an average rate of 4.3% per

annum. By way of contrast, the Canadian and U.S. automobile industries
experienced average per annum TFP growth rates of only 1.4% and 1.6%

respectively, about 1/3 of the Japanese rates. The large difference
between the TFP growth rates of the U.S. and Japanese automobile

industries is in sharp contrast to Norsworthy and Malmqvists (1983)
results for total manufacturing, where the Japanese advantage was much

less pronounced. The comparatively more rapid efficiency gain in Japan
is a major reason why long-run average cost, as measured in each
country's own currency, grew at only a 2.9% annual rate for Japanese

automobile production, whereas long-run average cost increased at a 7.6%
rate in Canada and at a 7.8% rate in the U.S.

As noted previously, these empirical results are obtained from an
estimated econometric cost function and a decomposition analysis.
Sections 2 and 3 present the formal model underlying the empirical

results. Included in Section 3 is a discussion of the way in which
capacity utilization effects are captured through a somewhat novel
application of the Viner—Wong envelope result. The specific empirical
results are contained in Sections 4 and 5.

The Cost Function Approach to the Analysis of Cost and Total
Factor Productivity Differences

2.1 Cost Comparisons - A Decomposition Analysis
Utilizing the duality between cost and production under the
assumption of cost-minimizing behaviour, we specify that the automobile
production process can be represented indirectly by the cost function

C1t =

(2.1)

G1t(w1t, 2it' 'it

where Ct is the total cost of production in country

i

at time t,

it is a vector of factor prices, 2it is a vector of outputs and 'it
is a vector of technological conditions which could be viewed as the

"characteristics" of the production process. Examples of characteristics
to be used in this study are an index of Research and Development
expenditures (a proxy for technical change) and capacity utilization.
The use of this characteristics approach was proposed by McFadden (1978)
and has been applied to telecommunications [Denny, et al. (1981a, b)],

trucking [Spady and Friedlaender (1978), Kim (1984)] and U.S. automobile

production [Friedlaender, Winston and Wang (1983)]. The logarithm of the
cost function (2.1) will be appproximated by a quadratic function in the

logarithms of it'

'it and D; i.e.,

log Ct = G(log fit' log it' log Ii )

(2.2)

where G is a quadratic function and D is a vector of country-specific

Equations (2.8), (2.10) and (2.11) provide the formulae for decomposing
average (unit) cost differences and total factor productivity differences
into their various sources.

Consider equation (2.8). The left hand side is the average cost
difference. This difference is due to differences in factor prices (the
first row on the right hand side), the effects of scale economies (the
second row), and the effects of technological characteristics (the third

row). Now consider equation (2.10). The average cost difference between
two points in time is due to differences in factor prices (the first
term), and total factor productivity growth between the two periods

(the second term). Finally, consider equation (2.11). Total factor
productivity growth over time within a country is due to output growth in
the presence of scale economies (the first row), and changes in

9
technological conditions (the second row).

3. Incorporating Capacity Utilization Effects into the Cost Function An Application of the Viner-Wong Envelope Theorem

As noted in the introduction, the automobile industry is
characterized by quasi-fixed factors and yearly fluctuations in demand

for its products. These features result in variations in capacity
utilization which cannot be captured by a long-run equilibrium model.

There are two possible approaches to this problem. First, a variable
cost function with exogenous quasi-fixed factors could be specified and

capacity utilization rates determined endogenously. An example of such
an approach is Berndt and Fuss (1982). Second, capacity utilization,
rather than the quasi—fixed factors, could be treated as exogenous. In
this case the demands for quasi-fixed factors are determined

endogenously.5 An example of this second approach is Cowing and
Stevenson (1981). While we intend to pursue the first approach in
subsequent research, in this paper we adopt the second approach. This
particular approach is likely to be successful when plants are designed,

ex ante, to produce a normal flow of output which can be relatively
easily measured. The major components of the automobile industry—vehicle
assembly and the manufacture of engines, transmissions and transaxles

satisfy this requirement.6 Specifying capacity utilization rather than
the levels of quasi-fixed factors as exogenous has two advantages. One,
the identity of the quasi-fixed factors does not need to be determined a

priori. Two, the analysis can proceed without the assumption that the
quasi-fixed factors are fixed in the short run.7

The existence of capacity utilization as an argument of the cost
function implies that the output argument should be capacity output.

13

Capacity output should be thought of as that flow of output per unit time

which is viewed as "normal" by the firm, in the sense that if the output
flow is sustained over time the firm has no incentive in the long run to

adjust the level of its quasi-fixed factors. Normal capacity utilization
then occurs when actual and designed (normal) output flows per unit time

are equal. Hence it is natural to index capacity utilization so that
it is unity when the actual output flow is at its normal rate.

Output increases which affect costs can occur in two ways. Existing
capacity can be utilized more intensively, or capacity can be increased,

utilization held constant. In this setting the Viner-Wong envelope
result between short—run and long—run average costs (Viner (1952))
implies a set of constraints on the parameters of the translog cost
function which are developed below.
Before proceeding to a detailed analysis of the envelope theorem, it
is convenient to specify the actual arguments of the cost function used

in the empirical analysis. The exogenous variables were specified as
foil ows:

input prices (K=3) —
outputs (J=1) -

capital

single

(1); materials (2); labour (3)

output, constant dollar capacity

(normal or designed) production of vehicles
and parts

technological conditions (L=3) —

capacity

utilization (1);

technological change proxy index—index of
real stock of R & 0 expenditures (2);
index of product mix (3)

8

14

The envelope theorem is satisfied if the cost-normal output and
cost-capacity utilization elasticities satisfy the following
relationships:

ECT1

ECQ1, normal capacity utilization

ECT1 < ECQ1, below normal capacity utilization

(3.1)

ECT1 > ECQ1, above normal capacity utilization

where ECT1 is the cost—capacity utilization elasticity and ECQ1 is
the cost-capacity output elasticity.
The relationship (3.1) is obvious for the case of long-run constant

returns to scale, once it is recognized that Ed1 is just the output
elasticity of the short-run average cost curve9 and ECQ1 is the output
elasticity of the long-run curve (equal to unity). For the case of
increasing returns to scale, consider Figure 3.1. At the normal capacity
utilization rate (output level OA), short-run marginal cost (SRMC) equals
long-run marginal cost (LRMC) and short—run average cost (SRAC) equals

long-run average cost (LRAC). Since

Now suppose output is expanded to OB. If

output expansion occurs with designed (normal) output QN constant,

movement is along the SRAC curve (actual output QA increasing) and
capacity utilization is above normal. If output expansion occurs with

capacity utilization T constant at the normal rate, then the
movement is along the LRAC curve (as QN increases). From Figure 3.1 it
can be seen that for output expansion beyond OA, SRAC is falling

relationship (3.1) has been demonstrated for the case of increasing

In order to develop the parameter constraints implied by the

envelope theorem, recall that the capacity utilization rate was indexed

so that it equals unity at the normal utilization rate. When capacity
utilization is at the normal rate, the elasticities can be written as

cost shares change to the

same extent when output increases, independent of whether the output
increase is due to increased capacity utilization or increased capacity.
Given the quasi-fixed nature of capital, capital cost shares will
increase more (and other input shares less) when capacity utilization

increases compared to capacity increases. To permit this possibility,

third order terms must be added to the cost function. A parsimonious,
sufficiently flexible specification is obtained by adding terms of the

The addition of (3.7) to the cost function implies that the

that an interaction term of the form

4. Empirical Results: Cost Function Estimation
The cost function was estimated using annual pooled three digit
automobile production data from Canada (1961-80), United States (1961—80)

and Japan (1968—80). A more detailed description of the data is
contained in the Data Appendix.
Equations (2.12 +

3.7)

and (2.13 +

3.8)

were estimated, with

constraints (2.14) and (3.6) imposed, using the Zeilner iterative

technique to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. Initial estimation
results implied that the regularity conditions for the cost functions

were not satisfied at a number of data points. The cost function was not
concave for Canada (16 observations) and non-monotone in the technical

change index (Canada (9 observations) and U.S. (4 observations)). The
minimal parameter constraints necessary to ensure local regularity over

the sample were imposed.12 In the case of the concavity constraints,

this implied different second order parameters ällc 33,c' 12,c'

13,c and 23,c

for Canada. Since the regularity constraints are not

nested in the basic specification, no formal testing was undertaken.

However, the imposition of the constraints led to only a moderate decline
in the log-likelihood function (from 545.17 to 536.29).

One additional set of constraints was imposed on the parameters. As
described in more detail in Fuss and Waverman (1985), the product mix
variable (13) was computed as an index where typical weights are assigned
to different classes of automobiles (sub—compact, compact, intermediate,

etc.) and an average weight for actual production is computed. This
variable fluctuated fairly tightly around 2500 for Japan and 3500 for

Canada and U.S. Hence it almost served as a dichotomous dummy variable

21

for Japan versus North America. From initial estimation results it

became clear that second order parameters involving 13 could not be
estimated and were set to zero. This had the effect of constraining the
cost-product mix elasticity to be a constant over time for each country,
although the elasticity could differ among countries.
The imposition of the above parameter constraints is reflected in

the parameter estimates presented in Table 1. Table 2 presents the
corresponding summary statistics. Own factor price elasticities and
elasticities of substitution are contained in Table 3. Table 4 presents
cost, scale, and technological conditions elasticities. The numbers in
Tables 3 and Tables 4 are calculated at each individual countrys mean
data point.

Using the parameter estimates found in Table 1, we verified that the
inequality condition (3.12) required by the envelope theorem is satisfied

at each data point in the sample. The importance of including the third
order capacity utilization terms is readily evident from the empirical

results. Each of the parameters

p1<11 k1,2,3 is statistically

significant, and the ones relating to capital and labour substantially

so. The signs of the parameters are the correct ones, indicating that as
underutilized capacity is utilized more intensively, the cost share of
capital declines and the cost shares of labour and materials increase.

Table 2 indicates that the model fits the data rather closely. The
Durbin—Watson statistics are in the inconclusive region, so there is no

obvious problem of serial correlation.13 Table 3 shows that factor
demand is inelastic.

22

Table 4 demonstrates that production in all three countries is
subject to increasing returns to scale at the mean data point.

Surprisingly, Canada has the lowest scale elasticity. The capacity
utilization elasticity shows that costs increase proportionately less
than actual output, (potential output held constant) so that there are

short-run economies of fill. Any increase in research and development
expenditures appears to have more of a cost-reducing impact in Japan than
in Canada or the U.S., although since the elasticities vary with the
data, this cannot be determined for certain from the mean elasticities.

The cost-product mix elasticities are very small. This is not
surprising since the output variable has been claculated from value and

price data so that it is denominated in standar& units (see Fuss and
Waverman (1985) for details concerning the construction).

If the

long-run marginal cost of producing a vehicle is proportional to category

weights,14 then the cost-product mix elasticity would be zero. If there
are economies of scale (i.e., non—proportionality) in producing larger
(heavier) automobiles then the elasticity would be negative.

23

Empirical Results: Rates of Growth of Cost, Productivity and
their Decomposition

Tables 5—9 present the empirical results on cost and productivity

which are the focus of this paper. Table 5 contains our analysis of
actual unit production costs over the 1970-80 period. The actual
percentage cost increase in a common currency (Canadian dollars) is
contained in column 1.

This figure is calculated as the average of the

increases over three 8-year periods: 1970-78, 1971-79 and 1972—80. The
three year averaging process was used in all calculations of growth rates

to smooth out somewhat the year-to—year fluctuations. In Canadian
dollars, unit costs increased by 85.6% in Canada, 117.6% in the U.S. and

116.7% in Japan. Relative to the U.S., Canada improved its competitive
position by a substantial amount and Japan did so by a small amount. The
pattern of cost increases in each country's own currency tells a

dramatically different story. The Japanese cost increase is only 22.7%,
compared with 90.3% for the U.S. and 85.6% for Canada. The difference in
the results is due to a substantial appreciation of the Japanese yen and
a smaller appreciation of the U.S. dollar, relative to the Canadian

dollar. Table 11 contains the time path of the relevant exchange rates
which had such a large impact on inter—country differences in cost growth
rates.

Table 5 also contains the decomposition of the unit cost increases.

The decomposition in Table 5 and subsequent tables is with respect to

unit costs as measured in the country's own currency. The bottom half of
the table presents the conventional "sources of growth" percentages
obtained from ratios of logarithmic differences (using equation 3.10).

24

The top half of the table presents an unconventional accounting which is,

for some purposes, more informative. The number 10.8 under the column
"price of labour" in the first row of Table 5 has the following

interpretation. If all variables affecting cost other than the price of
labour were constant over time at the geometric average of their values
in the years 1970, 71, 72, 78, 79 and 80, unit production cost in Canada

would have increased by 10.8% because of the actual increases in the

price of labour. Similarly, the number —9.3 under the column "technical
change" in the first row of Table 5 implies that if all variables except

the technical change variable 12 had been constant, Canadian unit
production cost would have fallen by 9.3% over the period. There is a
blank under the column "Interaction" since when only one variable is
allowed to differ between time periods, the interaction term is

identically equal to zero. From the above description, it can be seen
that what we have calculated in the upper half of Tables 5—9 is a set of
discrete comparative statics results for variations in the exogenous
variables affecting unit production costs and total factor productivity.
For a similar comparative statics analysis see Diewert and Morrison
(1985).

The major determinant of cost increases in all three countries has

been increases in materials prices. Technical change has been the major
source of cost reduction, especially in Japan.

As noted in the introduction, capacity utilization rates have varied
considerably from year—to-year in the North American automobile industry.

Utilization rates for the relevant years of our sample are presented in

Table 11. For the U.S., capacity utilization has varied from a high of

25

0.95 in 1972 to a low of 0.58 in 1980. This variation accounts for 6.7%
of the U.S. unit cost increase (from Table 5).

In order to analyse cost

increases on a long—run basis, we present in Table 6 the long-run
equilibrium results, assuming capacity utilization rates are constant at

the normal rate (unity) for all years for all three countries. As
expected, Canadian and U.S. cost growth rates decline. The slight
increase in the Japanese rate is not due to capacity utilization effects,
but rather to the replacement of actual cost with cost estimated from the

econometric model. The negative estimation residual (Table 5) implies
that the estimated cost increase exceeds the actual cost increase.
Table 7 presents the long—run equilibrium decomposition in a

slightly different way. The components of total factor productivity
(TFP) growth are aggregated (using equation 3.11) and compared with the

factor price effects. This table portrays in a graphic way the fact that
the Japanese auto industry has used productivity growth to keep unit
production cost increases to a minimal compared with North American
producers.

Tables 8 and 9 examine changes in total factor productivity in the

three countries over the averaged 8 year period. Actual TFP grew only
7.7% in Canada and 8.3% in the U.S. compared with a 43.1% increase in

Japan. The substantial decline in capacity utilization in the North
American automobile industry between the early 1970's and the late 19701s
had a much more significant impact on TFP growth than on unit cost
increases. When capacity utilization effects are removed (Table 9), TFP

growth during the period increases to 11.3% in Canada and 13.4% in the
U.S., substantially higher than actual TFP growth, but still dwarfed

26

by the Japanese growth of 39.8%. The contributions of the various
sources of TFP growth are very similar in the three countries:
approximately 80% is due to technical change and 20% to scale economies.

Table 10 contains average annual rates of growth of unit cost and
total factory productivity corresponding to the total period

proportionate growth contained in Tables 5—9. Among the more interesting
figures in Table 10 is the U.S. automobile industrys yearly rate of
long-run productivity growth. A growth rate of 1.6% is high relative to
the total manufacturing rate of less than l%15, but pales beside the

Japanese auto industry's TFP growth rate of 4.3%. Similarly, while the
Canadian rate of 1.4% is higher than average for manufacturing, it is
well below the Japanese growth rate.

27

6. Conclusions
In this paper we have calculated and analysed the automobile
industry's cost and productivity experience during the 1970's in Canada,

United States and Japan. Percentage cost increases in a common currency
(Canadian dollars) differed less significantly than the increases in each

country's own currency due to currency realignments. The appreciation of
the Japanese yen during the 1970's masked the superior performance of the
Japanese auto industry relative to the North American industry during

that period. Of course rates of growth analysis cannot determine whether
Japan was just catching up to North American productivity levels or

pulling ahead. A levels analysis is required to answer that important
question. Our preliminary analysis of cost and productivity levels (Fuss
and Waverman (1985)) suggests that the catch-up story is essentially
correct, with the Japanese industry slightly more productive (1-2%) than
the U.S. industry by 1980, at normal capacity utilization rates.

Finally, we have emphasized the importance of taking account of
variations in capacity utilization when analysing TFP growth rates for an

industry such as the automobile industry. Failure to do so would have
led to a 31% underestimate of TFP growth in Canada during the 1970's and
a 37% underestimate for the United States.

We are also in the process of making level comparisons. See Fuss
and Waverman (1985).

For a description of the Quadratic Lemma see Diewert (1976) and

Denny and Fuss (1983). The specific decomposition formula (2.3) can
be found in Denny and Fuss (1980) and Denny, May and Fuss (1981).
3.

The empirical results specified below assume a single output

technology and use a uproduct mix characteristic variable to
account for the effect of a different output composition on costs.
Since a logical alternative specification (given sufficient data) is
the multiple output cost function, we will provide the decomposition
analysis for this case.
4.

If the producer engages in marginal cost pricing and constant

returns to scale exist, then slog Qc is just the change in the
Tornqvist approximation to the Divisia aggregate index.
5.

Of course neither quasi—fixed factors nor utilization rates are

truly exogenous to the firm's decision process. What is meant by
11exogenous" in this context is that the observed variables are not

in long-run equilibrium; i.e., the levels of quasi-fixed factors are

not necessarily chosen to equate the marginal rate of factor
substitution to the current ratio of factor prices, and the rate of

actual output flow is not necessarily equal to the designed (or
normal) rate of flow.

See Miller (1985) for a discussion of the case of vehicle assembly.

The main disadvantage of the approach taken in this paper is that
the only disequilibrium feature which can be captured is the

deviation of actual from designed output. While this is by far the
most important source of disequilibrium in the automobile industry,
disequilibrium due to fluctuations in factor prices can be captured
by the variable cost function model.

11. The specification adopted is still not sufficiently flexible to
deal with the case of overutilization of capacity since when

30

will lead to an increase in the cost

T1 > 1, an increase in

share of capital, which is counterintuitive. This does not create a
problem for the current application since only 6 of the 53

observations have T > 1 and the maximum value of T1 in the
sample is 1.04.

In cases where this problem is more significant,

one possible solution is to replace the coefficients k11 with

Pkll.SV where SV, a switch variable, equals +1 when

T < 1 and equals —1 when T1 > 1.
12. The constraints were minimal in the sense that the concavity
condition was satisfied over the complete sample with only one data
point (Canada, 1974) being subject to a binding constraint.
Similarly, the monotonicity conditions were satisfied with only two

binding constraints (Canada, 1961 and U.S., 1961). To some extent
this result was fortuitous since no formal inequality restrictions

algorithm was attempted. For an example of the use of such a formal
procedure, see Hazilla and Kopp (1985).

13. The inconclusive region is quite wide, given the large number of
parameters and relatively small number of data points. A first
order serial correlation adjustment was attempted but resulted in
implausibly high estimates of scale elasticities, especially for

Japan. This result suggests that the first order filtering process
is a misspecification and thus the non-filtered results are
presented.

14. This is a fact widely believed in the industry.
15. Compare estimates by Berndt and Fuss (1982) and Norsworthy and
Malmqvist (1983) for example.

DATA APPENDIX

In this Data Appendix we provide a brief description of the sources

and construction of data used in the empirical analysis. Greater detail
can be found in Fuss and Waverman (1985). The general data sources were
the Annual Surveys (or Census) of Manufacturers in each country. One
problem with these data is the omission of a number of automotive-related
production statistics from these annual surveys undertaken by the

specific country's statistical office. Several relevant 4 digit SIC
codes are not classified to the Motor Vehicles Industries in the USA and
Canada (for example, automotive products foundries are classified to SIC
294 -

foundries

in Canada; in the USA, automotive stampings is included

in All Metal Stampings prior to 1972). These omissions affect our
results to the extent that some bias is imparted if the omitted
sub—industries are significantly different from those included.
Nominal gross output data were taken from the central statistical

surveys and converted to real output in constant dollars by applying the
appropriate price deflators (available in Canada from Statistics Canada,
in the USA, from the Bureau of Industrial Economics (B.I.E.) and in Japan
from the Bank of Japan).

The output price deflators are indices which are normalized to be

unity in a particular year for each country. The same normalization

occurs for materials and capital services prices. Because the cost
function contains only zero and first order country—specific
coefficients, except for very small differences in some factor price
related second order terms, the estimated characterization of the

32

production process in terms of elasticities is essentially invariant to
the choice of the benchmark data set which is used to bridge the

inter-country price indices to obtain absolute level comparisons. This
is also true for country-specific rates of growth of cost and total

factor productivity, which are the topics of this paper. However, the
data are also being used to make inter-country cost and productivity
level comparisons, and so great care was exercised in calculating the

benchmark data. The interested reader can find the details in Fuss and
Waverman (1985). Of course the country-specific zero and first order
regression coefficients contained in Table 1 do depend on the specific
benchmark data set used to bridge the country-specific data.
Three inputs are used —

materials,

labour and capital. Materials

price deflators were available for all three countries. The total
compensation (rather than just the money wage) of labour has been
calculated and hours worked estimated for production and non-production

workers (except in Japan where the total number of workers has not been

disaggregted). Real capital stock data were available for Canada
(Garston, 1983) and the USA (Norsworthy and Malmquist (1983), Levy and
Jondrow (1983)), but had to be estimated for Japan using data from the
Annual Census and the perpetual inventory method.
The appropriate price of capital for our purposes is the ex ante

user cost of capital services. Appropriate series at the 3 digit level

were not available. For Canada we used a series for the 2 digit
industry, transportation equipment, constructed by Michael Denny. The
automotive industry-specific capital service price series which were

avilable for the U.S. had been estimated by the residual method, which is

33

an inappropriate ex ante measure for such a highly cyclical industry. We
have instead utilized a user cost of capital series for U.S. total
manufacturing (which would not be subject to such cyclical variations)

presented in Norsworthy and Malmqvist (1983). This series is available
only to 1977 and was updated to 1980 using internal U.S. Bureau of the

Census capital service price data. The capital service price for Japan
is an extrapolation of the series for Japanese total manufacturing also

presented in Norsworthy and Malmqvist (1983). That series was available
through 1978. Our extrapolation involved using the change in the
Japanese prime interest rate beyond 1978 (DRI Japan Survey) and the
changes in the price deflator for plant and equipment for the Japanese

transportation equipment industry (Source: Price Indexes Annual).
Capacity utilization rates were calculated from data for vehicle

assembly. We began by constructing a series for maximum output. Maximum
(potential) output was measured in the USA and Canada as the maximum
weekly nameplate output and in Japan as the maximum monthly output.
Capacity utilization was initially measured as the ratio of actual

production to maximum production. The "normal", or designed, capacity
utilization rate was defined as the average utilization rate for Japan

over the period 1969—80. Actual capacity utilization rates were
normalized so that this average rate was equal to unity. Capacity
(normal) output was defined as the actual output divided by the
normalized capacity utilization rate.
We have estimated a technological change indicator -

the

capital

stock' of Research and Development. This stock is constructed from
annual R &D expenditures by converting them to a real capital stock

34

utilizing the perpetual inventory method, the country—specific CPI and a

depreciation rate of 15%. For Canada and the USA, we aggregated the two
capital stocks into one series, assuming that the same technology was

available to the producers in both countries. Our data on R & 0
expenditures for Japan began in 1966. Therefore, we needed a benchmark R
& 0 stock. We assumed that in 1966 the technology available to Japan
could be represented by the R & 0 stock per automobile produced in North

America. We multiplied this value by the automobile production in Japan
in 1966 to arrive at our benchmark. Since automobile production in Japan
in 1966 was quite small relative to North America, the above procedure
assigns a small value of the technical change index to Japan in 1966.

Because of the way in which the R & D index was constructed, it has only
a tentative link to the effect of R & 0 expenditures on costs. We believe
it is more properly viewed as a method of tracking the country-specific

unexplained technical change. From this point of view the variable is
similar to a time trend and was utilzied because it consistently
outperformed a time trend in the regression analysis.
