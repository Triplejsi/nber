Life Insurance of the Elderly:
klequacy and Determinants

ABSTRTCT

Despite

a general reduction in poverty among the aged, roughly one third of

elderly nonmarried women are officially poor. Many of these women are widows.
The fact that poverty rates are significantly larger for widows than for married
women suggests that many households may fail to buy sufficient life insurance.

This paper considers the adequacy and determinants of life insurance among the

elderly. Its principal conclusions are:
(1) Combined private and public life insurance is inadequate for a significant
minority of elderly households;

(2) Of those elderly households in which the husband's future income represents
a significant fraction of total household resources, roughly half are
inadequately insured;

(3) Households do not significantly offset Social Security's provision of

survivor insurance by reducing their private purchase of life insurance; and

(4) The actual determinants of the purchase of life insurance appear to differ
greatly from those predicted by economic theory.

Introduction

In the past several decades there has been a significant improvement in

the general economic position of the elderly. In contrast to 1960, when over
a third of elderly households had incomes below the poverty line, the current

figure is roughly 15 percent. Despite the general reduction in poverty among
the aged, the poverty rate amoung elderly nonmarried women, including widows,

remains high. Today roughly one third of elderly nonmarried women are
officially poor.

The fact that 31 percent of elderly nonmarried women, but only 8 percent of
elderly married women are in poverty suggests a significant economic risk from

the dissolution of marriage through divorce or death. While divorce insurance
is unavailable, life insurance is readily available. However, many households
may fail to buy enough life insurance. Presumably, concern about insufficient
life insurance underlies the provision of survivor and death benefits by the
Social Security system. This paper examines the adequacy of the life insurance

protection provided by the combination of private and public insurance. It also
investigates the determinants of private life insurance purchases. There are
three central questions addressed in the study:

(1) How large are private life insurance holdings relative to the amounts
needed to maintain prior living standards of surviving spouses?

(2) Do Social Security survivor benefits significantly increase the amount of
life insurance protection?
(3)

Is the pattern of private insurance purchases in general accord with the
predictions of economic theory, particularly the proposition that Social

Security survivor insurance should substitute (under assumptions specified
below) dollar for dollar for private life insurance?

—2—

The answers to these questions are clearly very important for understanding
the cause of poverty among widows, the extent of the government's intervention
in the life insurance market, and the effectiveness of that intervention in
increasing the sum of private plus public life insurance.

The data set chosen for this study, the Retirement History Survey (RHS), is
attractive because it focuses on the elderly and because it permits the
observation of household economic status before and after the death of a spouse.

These data are, however, deficient in several respects for the study of life
insurance. First they include the face value, but not the cash value of life

insurance policies. Second, while there are a variety of questions about
retirement plans and expected future income, many of these questions were not

answered by a considerable number of respondents. Understanding the size of
expected future income, particularily labor earnings, is obviously of great

importance for assessing the adequacy of life insurance holdings. Given
these data problems our results should be viewed cautiously. However, in some
important cases, correcting biases arising from missing data would likely
strengthen our conclusions.

The principal inferences we draw from this study are:

(1) Combined private and public life insurance is inadequate for a significant
minority of elderly households.

(2) Almost one half of households at risk (those for whom a significant
portion of household resources take the form of earnings and benefits that
cease with the death of the husband or wife) are inadequately insured.

(3) Empirical estimation of the demand for life insurance produces many results
that are greatly at odds with theorectical predictions.

—3-

(4) Households do not appear to significantly offset Social Security's
provision of survivor insurance by reducing their private purchase of life
insurance.

There are four remaining sections in the paper. The next presents
general descriptive information about the extent and adequacy of life

insurance. Adequacy of life insurance is assessed in terms of the ability of

surviving spouses to maintain their previous living standards. Comparisons of
previous with current living standards are made for households in which a

spouse dies between 1969 and 1971. In addition, for all married households in
1969 similar comparisons are made for hypothetical surviving spouses. After
presenting these comparisons of pre- and post-death living standards of actual
and potential surviving spouses we discuss six potential biases -in these

comparisons. In our view, these six biases, on net, lead us to understate the
inadequacy of life insurance holdings.

The third section examines optimal choice of life insurance holdings

within a simple two period model. The substitutability of private and public
insurance is considered as well as the proper valuation of future income
streams under the assumption of incomplete life insurance and annuity markets.
The model illustrates the interdependent choices of life insurance of

husbands and wives. As stressed in this section, the insurance demand of one
spouse depends on whether the other spouse has positive or zero life insurance.

The model assumes that private annuities are unavailable. As pointed out by
Yaari (1965), purchasing private annuities is effectively equivalent to having

negative holdings of life insurance. Negative holdings of life insurance are
ruled out because annuities appear available on the private market only at

-4-.

extremely unfair rates (Friedman and Warshawsky 1985). None of the households
in our RHS sample reported holdings of private annuities.

The theoretical model of section III motivates the econometric

specification of a two indicator switching regressions model, which is presented

in section IV. Section V discusses the empirical findings and uses the results
to evaluate Social Security's impact on the purchase of private insurance. The
final section summarizes the paper's findings and suggests ideas for additional
research.

II. The Adequacy of Life Insurance

A. Conceptual Framework
This section considers the adequacy of life insurance by comparing living
standards before and after either the actual or hypothetical death of a

spouse. The definition of living standard is obviously arbitrary. By
living standard we mean the sustained level of consumption of goods and services
that can be afforded, based on the household's current assets and current and

future income. Calculating affordable consumption annuities both prior to and
after the death of a spouse requires information on the net worth, future labor
earnings, private pensions, and Social Security benefits available to the couple
when both spouses are alive as well as to actual or hypothetical surviving

spouses. Life insurance obviously raises the resources available to surviving
spouses, and its purchase can protect surviving spouses from a reduction in
their affordable standards of living.

The size of consumption streams that can be financed from a given amount

of resources depends on actuarial factors, such as the interest rate, the extent

—5—

to which annuities are implicitly, if not explicitly available, and household

economies to scale in joint consumption. "Economies to scale" refers to the
"two can live cheaper than one' proposition. Obviously many goods, such as
heating, lighting, and other housing services, are jointly consumed by married

couples. Other goods, such as food and clothing, do not have this public goods
feature.

To see the importance of the economies of scale issue, consider at one
extreme that all goods consumed by couples are local public goods like heating.
In this case, for surviving spouses to maintain prior affordable living
standards, they need to be able to purchase the same commodities when single

that they and their spouse would have purchased when married. To do so
obviously requires the same economic resources. By full insurance of the
survival—contingent income stream of each spouse, the living standard of the
surviving spouse will be fully insured.

While fully insuring the survival contingent income stream is required to
maintain living standards of survivors when all household consumption is joint,

this is not true in the absence of significant economies to scale. Consider the
case of no joint consumption by married couples. In this setting the surviving
spouse will suffer a drop in affordable living standard only if the uninsured
decedent's survival-contingent income stream would have financed more than his
or her own stream of consumption; i.e., fully insuring the surviving spouse
requires buying insurance equal to the difference between the value of the
decedent's future income stream and the value of his or her future consumption.
If this difference is negative, i.e., the value of the future income stream the
decedent would have earned is less than the potential future value of his or her

—6-

consumption, the surviving spouse's living standard will be greater than it
would have been had his or her spouse not died.

Since we do not know the precise extent of economies to scale, we present
our adequacy of life insurance calculations assuming no economies to scale and

then discuss the likely bias arising from ignoring scale economies. "Living
standard" is measured in the calculations as the level annuity that could be

financed with available resources. Prior to the actual or hypothetical death of
a spouse, we calculate the combined resources of the couple and compute the
level annuity, 4m' that could be purchased for each spouse under the assumption

that each spouse receives an equal annuity. Next we determine the annuity that

could be afforded by the surviving spouse, A. The ratio of the second annuity
to the first annuity (As/Am) is our measure of the adequacy of insurance.
Ratios below .75 are described as "inadequate."
More formally, let PVRm be the present value of resources of the couple
when they are both alive, and let PVR5 be the present value of resources of the

surviving spouse. We calculate As/Am: where Am: the annuity of the surviving
spouse when married and A5, the annuity of the surviving spouse after the
partner's death, are determined by:

D)A

(im)

PVRm = (Dh +

(is)

PVR5 = D5A5, s = h,w

In (1) Dh and

are discount factors for the husband and wife; 0h equals the

present value of $1 received annually by the husband until his death; D is
correspondingly defined.

represents the discount factor for the surviving

—7-

spouse, where s = h or w.

As discussed by Yaari (1965), Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981), and Bernheim
(1986) and as indicated in the next section, in the presence of life span

uncertainty, the proper valuation of future income streams depends critically on

the nature of explicit and implicit insurance arrangements. At one extreme one
could assume a perfect market in annuities and life insurance in which
insurance prenria are actuarially fair. In this case PVRm and PVRS would

correspond to the present expected values of resources of married couples and
surviving spouses, where the expectation is taken over survival probabilities.

Similarily, Dh. D, and

would be the expected value discount factors.

Even if there were no public market in annuities, Kotlikoff and Spivak
(1981) indicate that risk sharing amoung family members (e.g., parents and

children) can closely approximate perfect annuity insurance even when the number

of family members is as few as four. While families are not as effective in
hedging the loss of future income streams (i.e., providing life insurance) as
they are in hedging the duration of future consumption streams (i.e., providing
annuity insurance), the combination of life insurance that is close to

actuarially fair plus family annuity insurance arrangements may approximate the

situation of perfect life and annuity insurance. In this case, using
actuarially fair discounting in forming PVRm PVR5, Dh, and

would be roughly

appropriate.

If public insurance markets are far from perfect such that market insurance
is effectively unavailable and if family arrangements do not arise, then simple
discounting by only the interest rate is appropriate (assuming no constraints on

borrowing and lending). Between the case of perfect insurance and zero

—8-

,nsurance are a range of partial insurance environments in which future streams

are priced (discounted) using survival probabilities to some extent depending on

the availability and pricing of particular insurance policies. The next section
examines such cases.

Since assessing the precise degree to which the insurance market is

complete is difficult, if not impossible, we examine the As/Am ratios
assuming, at one extreme, perfect insurance, and, at the other extreme, no

insurance. In our view the assumption of perfect insurance is a closer
approximation to the reality experienced by the RHS sample than the assumption

of zero insurance. This assessment is based on the fact that 65 percent of
our 1969 RHS sample of elderly couples report positive life insurance for both
spouses and for another 22 percent of couples the life insurance of at least one

spouse is positive. At least some of this life insurance surely represents term
insurance, and, as demonstrated by Yaari (1965), buying additional life

insurance is equivalent to selling an annuity. Hence, for at least those
couples in which both spouses have term life insurance, one can argue that

annuities were available at the margin; had these couples purchased less term

insurance they would have had more annuities. In addition, the ability of
parents implicitly to insure longevity risk with their children leads us to view
the perfect insurance benchmark as more appropriate than the zero insurance
benchmark.

retirement benefits, PVS stands for the present expected value of Social

Security survivor benefits, and F represents the decedentst insurance. The
subscripts m,h,w, s and d stand for the married couple, the husband, the wife,

the surviving spouse, and the decedent spouse. When s = h, d = w, and when
s = w, d

As indicated in (2s), in calculating hypothetical annuities for surviving
spouses in 1969, PVR5 includes the life insurance of the hypothetical decedent

spouse, Fd. In the comparison of the 1971 value of A5 with the 1969 value of

Am reported NW presumably includes unspent proceeds from the decedent spouses'
life insurance; hence Fd is not included in forming PVR5. This formulation of

(2) treats reported life insurance as if it were only term insurance. Below we
indicate how the distribution of the As/Am ratios would be affected by making
the opposite assumption, namely that the unreported cash value of life insurance
equals the reported face value.
Net worth equals the sum of the reported values of assets less the

reported values of liabilities. Observations were deleted if the market value

-10-

of real estate was not reported, if the value of mortgages were not reported, or
if more than two types of financial assets had missing values.

1.

Calculating the Present Value of Earnings and
Non-Social Security Pensions

The present value of earnings was calculated by assuming current real

earnings continue to the reported expected age of retirement. Respondents
indicating they would never retire were assigned an expected retirement age,

calculated in the following manner. Using the RNS Social Security earnings
histories, we determined the actual retirement ages for those nongoverrment

workers who stated in 1969 that they would never retire, but did in fact stop

working prior to 1975. With these data, we were able to calculate age-specific
probabilities of retiring at each age between ages 58 and 67. We assumed that
those who did not retire by age 67 retired, on average, at age 70. Using this
information, we calculated the expected age of retirement for those stating they
never intended to retire as a function of age in 1969.
Similar calculations were made for respondents with positive 1969 labor
earnings who indicated that they were partially retired, but did not state an

expected age of complete retirement. Also included in this group were 1969
respondents who reported positive labor earnings, but stated that they were

retired. Since spouses were not asked in 1969 when they expected to retire the
same technique was used to estimate the expected retirement ages for spouses

with positive labor earnings in 1969. In this case we calculated age-specific
retirement probabilities between the ages 51 and 67 and again assumed an average
retirement age of 70 for spouses not retiring before age 67.
For employed respondents and spouses, current earnings equals 1968 Social

—11—

Security reported earnings (obtained from the RHS Social Security earnings
records) valued in 1969 dollars provided these earnings were below the 1968
earnings ceiling, but above the 1968 earnings reported by the respondent and

spouse. If 1968 Social Security reported earnings were above the earnings
ceiling or below 1968 self-reported earnings, 1968 self-reported earnings
valued in 1969 dollars are used.

The stream of non—social security pension benefits

equals currently

reported pension benefits prior to the expected retirement age and the larger of
current pension benefits and reported expected retirement benefits after the
expected retirement age. Since there is no information on whether these pensions

will provide joint survivor benefits, we assume that these benefits accrue

solely to the husbands. It is our understanding that prior to the passage of
ERISA, joint survivor annuities were relatively rare. Since pension benefits of
the wife are not reported in the 1969 survey, we include only those of the

husband in the analysis. This omission biases downwards our calculation of
Aw/Am and biases upwards our calculation of Ah/Am•

2. Calculating the Present Value of Social Security Benefits
The stream of future Social Security benefits was calculated by first
determining the age 62 Primary Insurance Amount (P14) for each respondent and

spouse. Earnings prior to 1969 used in this P14 calculation were obtained from
the social security earnings records. Earnings between 1962 and the year in
which the respondent or spouse reaches age 62 are projected as just described.
The wife's social security benefit is the larger of her own benefit and the
dependent benefit, once the wife is eligible for the dependent benefit (ie., she

—12—

is older than 62 and her husband -is receiving benefits or

-is

dead).

Prior to

eligibility for the dependent benefit the wife may be eligible to collect her

own benefit. For respondents and spouses who either indicated they were already
retired, expected to retire prior to age 62, or were earning less than $1680
(the social security exempt amount), the actuarially

reduced stream of benefits

commences at age 62. For respondents and spouses expecting to retire after age
62 or earning above $1660, actuarially reduced benefits commmence at the
indicated expected retirement age assuming that age is less than or equal to 65.
Between ages 65 and 72 respondents and spouses who have not yet retired
(according to stated or imputed expectations) are given earnings-tested benefits

in our calculations. After age 72 non earnings-tested benefits are available
for all respondents and spouses.

In the contingency that the husband is dead survivor benefits are

available. As described above, these benefits are provided on an actuarially
reduced basis and are earnings-tested where appropriate. While our calculations
of total benefits follow Social Security law, we define the stream of social
security survivor benefits to be the excess of the surviving wife's benefit over
what she would receive were her husband not dead.
In projecting future real Social Security benefits we treat households as
assuming that current Social Security law will continue, except that benefits
will be increased -in the future to adjust for inflation.

-13-

3. Data Characteristics
After deletion of observations with missing data the 1969 sample of married

households numbers 5131. A total of 4295 husbands and 3389 wives reported
positive life insurance. Table 1 presents mean values of life insurance
holdings as well as components of PVR cross—classified by level of PVR, the

present value of family resources. In forming present values all future
earnings, Social Security, and pension streams are actuariarily discounted

using

mortality probabilities and assuming a 4 percent real interest rate. The
overall average holdings of life insurance of husbands is $9360, which may be

compared with the mean value of PVR, $108,886. Life insurance is small
relative to PVR, but is it small relative to the amount of the husband's
future earnings and social security and other pension benefit streams that
could be insured?

The answer is that the mean value of the husband's insurance is less than
one fifth the suni of the mean values of such insurable future income streams.

Insurance holdings of wives is even smaller relative to their insurable streams;
the ratios of these means is less than 6 percent. These figures would be
inconsequential were future income streams only a trivial fraction of PVR. This

is not the case. Future income streams of husbands are 44 percent of our sample
households' total PVR; and those of wives are 19 percent. The table also
indicates that Social Security survivor benefits represent almost one fourth of
combined private plus public insurance on the life of the husband.

However,

even ignoring any private insurance offset, they make only a very small
contribution to reducing the gap between husbands' insurable streams and their
private life insurance.

The table suggests insurance is much more adequate for those with less than

$25,000 in PVR. For couples with PVR above $250,000 the husband's insurance is
also larger relative to PVR; for this group the husband's future income streams

are less than one fifth of PVR. The concern about

inadequate insurance is,

therefore, much more of an issue for middle class households with PVR between
$25,000 and $250,000.

C. Annuity Ratios
Table 2 compares the annuity that actual surviving wives could purchase in
1971 with the corresponding annuity they could have purchased in 1969 when their

husbands were alive (assuming, as stated, the purchase of an annuity of equal

amount for their husbands). In this table as well as Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 the
assumption of perfect insurance is maintained; hence, the annuity ratios are
based on discounting by both mortality and interest rates. Over 1/3 of
surviving spouses are unable to afford an annuity as large as 75 percent of what

was affordable while married. For 15 percent of the sample the affordable
annuity is less than one half of what could have been

purchased (assuming

perfect insurance) while married. At the other extreme, a sizeable fraction of
widows appear economically better off after the death of their husbands. For

over one quarter of the sample of surviving widows the 1971 affordable annuity
is over twenty-five percent larger than the 1969 affordable annuity.

Table 3 presents similar calculations for men who were widowed between 1969

and 1971. Although the sample is small, it appears that a smaller percentage of
widowers than widows experienced a large drop in consumable resources from the

death of their spouse. Only 13 percent of the widowers have annuity ratios less

than .75, and 30 percent have ratios greater than 1.25.
Table 4 considers the entire 1969 sample of households and compares the
annuity that could be purchased at the time of the RHS interview with the
annuity that the surviving wife could have purchased had her husband expired

immediately after the interview. This distribution of hypothetical surviving
wives by their annuity ratios is quite similar to that of Table 2. About 25
percent of the sample has an annuity ratio below .75; almost 50 percent have a
ratio less than 1.

A sizeable fraction, 33 percent, has an annuity ratio above

1.25.

Turning to hypothetical surviving husbands (Table 5) we find a dramatically
different situation. only 2 percent of hypothetical widowers have annuity ratios
below .75; 95 percent have ratios above 1, and 73 percent have ratios above 1.5.
Clearly there is little reason for general concern about inadequate life
insurance of wives.

Another way of examining the adequacy of insurance coverage is to limit
investigation to those couples where significant insurance would be required to
keep a surviving spouse from suffering a large drop in consumable resources.
This would exclude couples with most of their wealth held in current net worth,
since the death of a spouse in such cases would have little effect on total
family resources (excluding insurance) available to the survivor.

We therefore

repeat, in Tables 6 and 7, the calculations of Tables 4 and 5 for the subsamples
of husbands and wives who are "at risk", which we define to be those for whom
the other spouse's survival—contingent resources (labor earnings, pension
benefits, and Social Security benefits) constitute over half of the family's
total resources.

Over half of the wives in our full sample are, by this measure, at risk.

Of this group, over 45 percent have an annuity ratio of less than .75. For
wives and husbands at risk who are in poorer households the extent of

underinsurance is more significant. Consider, for example, wives at risk with
household PVR between 25 and 50 thousand dollars in Table 6. Fifty-five percent
of this group have an annuity ratio below .75, and 20 percent have a ratio below
.5. Table 7 indicates that 28 percent of husbands at risk have hypothetical

annuity ratios below .75. However, the number of "at risk" husbands is small.
These results reinforce our previous ones that underinsurance, particularly of
husbands, is a potentially serious problem indeed.

0. Potential Biases in the Annuity Ratio Calculations
1.

IQnoring Cash Value of Life Insurance

To see how excluding the unobserved cash value of life insurance should

affect Tables 3 and 4, consider again equations (1) and (2). In the case of
hypothetical surviving wives PVRm is too small by an amount equal to the cash
value of the husband's and wife's insurance, while PVR5, which includes the
face value and thus the cash value of the decedent spouse's insurance (Fd), is

too small by an amount equal to just the cash value of the surviving spouse's

insurance. Since the average value of the husbands' insurance is over 8 times
larger than that of wives, one would expect the cash value of the husbands'

insurance greatly to exceed that of the wives. As a consequence the omission of
cash value implies that the ratio PVRw/PVRm is biased upwards and the ratio

PVRh/PVRm is biased downwards. This implies an upwards bias in the calculation
of the hypothetical surviving wives' annuity ratios (Aw/Am) and a downward bias

—17—

in

the calculated annuity ratios of surviving husbands (Ah/Am)
To consider the possible extent of this bias we recalculated Table 3 under

the assumption that the cash value of husbands' and wives' insurance equals the

face value; i.e., there is no term insurance. This assumption increases from 25
percent to 27 percent the fraction of hypothetical surviving wives with annuity

ratios below .75. The bias with respect to the values of Ah/Am in Table 5 is in
the opposite direction; here making the extreme assumption of no term insurance

increases the annuity ratio for hypothetical widowers. Again the potential bias
is small; the fraction of hypothetical widowers with annuity ratios above 1.5
rises from 73 percent to 74 percent.

2. Economies of Scale
Ignoring economies of scale in household consumption biases upwards both
widows' and widowers' annuity ratios, if the annuity is viewed as the level

stream of consumption that can be financed. Suppose, for example, that
household consumption was a pure public good. In this case the consumption
stream that could be financed with Am would equal two times Am provided both

spouses remain alive. For a widow with an annuity ratio of .75, the death of
her spouse, according to this reasoning, means a 62.5 percent ((2—.75)/2)

decline in consumption and an adjusted annuity ratio of .375 (.75/2). Hence,
Tables 2 through 7 may significantly understate the potential welfare decline
experienced by surviving spouses.

-18--

3. Bequests to Children and End of Life Expenses
The hypothetical annuity ratios also ignore possible bequests to children,
end of life uninsured medical and funeral expenses, and, for those few

observations with considerable wealth, estate taxes. Inclusion of these factors
would reduce the hypothetical annuity ratios below the reported values. This
point is supported by the finding that actual annuity ratios of surviving
spouses in Tables 2 and 3 are smaller than those of hypothetical surviving
spouses in Tables 4 and 5; 36 percent of actual widows, but only 25 percent of
hypothetical widows have ratios below .75, and 14 percent of actual widowers,
but only 2 percent of hypothetical widowers have ratios below .75.

4. Valuing Future Streams if Insurance is Imperfect
The annuity distributions of Tables 2 through 7 are quite sensitive to
the use of perfect insurance valuation. For example, -if one discounts future
streams only by the interest rate, which would be appropriate absent any
explicit or implicit insurance arrangement, the fraction of those at risk
hypothetical surviving wives with inadequate insurance protection drops from

over 45 percent to only 20 percent. For at risk hypothetical surviving
husbands, on the other hand, the fraction with inadequate -insurance protection

rises from 28 percent to 40 percent. The direction of these changes reflects
the fact that Dh/Dw is larger when discounting by only the interest rate than
when discounting by both interest and mortality rates; husbands in the sample

are older and have larger age specific death rates than their wives. While we
present these alternative calculations to permit the reader to draw his or her
own conclusion, in our view the calculations based on the assumption of close

-19-

to

perfect insurance arrangements better approximate the -insurance environment

of the RHS sample.

5. Income Taxes and Choice of Real Interest Rate
In calculating the annuity ratios we did not attempt to estimate taxes that

would be paid on earnings and pension streams. Nor did we estimate the marginal
effective income tax rate to form an after tax rate of return for discounting

future income streams. We believe that these adjustments would, on net, lower
the annuity ratios. Present value calculations of this kind are highly

sensitive to the choice of discount rate. Realistic inclusion of tax factors
would lead to discounting by an after tax real return substantially below 4
percent, which would raise considerably the present values of those income

streams that would be lost in the event of a spouse's death. Since the ratio
is a decreasing function of the discount rate, if the husband is older than
the wife adjusting for taxes would lower the annuity ratios of surviving wives
by more than that of surviving husbands.

6. Earnings Uncertainty
The annuity ratio calculations assume future real earnings are certain with

the exception of earnings uncertainty due to death. While we have not closely
examined the bias from ignoring other types of earnings uncertainty, we believe

that, roughly speaking, uncertain future earnings should be discounted by a risk
adjusted discount rate -- a rate that could well be higher than the 4 percent

real rate used here. Hence, by ignoring earnings uncertainty we are probably
biasing downward the calculated annuity ratios and, on this score, exaggerating
somewhat the need for additional life insurance.

-20-

111. A Model of Life Insurance Demand
This section develops an estimable model of the demand for life insurance
by married couples, based on the assumption of expected

utility maximization.

The model focuses on life cycle consumption of husbands and wives and ignores
possible parental bequest motives and longevity risk sharing between parents and

children. it also ignores earning uncertainty. The purposes of estimating a
model of life insurance demand are twofold:

first, to determine whether the

actual purchase of life insurance is in accord with predictions of economic
theory, and second, to determine the extent to which households reduce their
private purchase of life insurance in response to Social Security's provision of

survivor insurance. Assuming the husband's life insurance is positive, the
theory predicts that properly valued income streams of the wife, including her
labor earnings, public and private pension benefits, and survivor benefits,
should substitute at the margin dollar for dollar for the husband's life

insurance. Similar arbitrage relationships should hold at the margin between
the wife's insurance and properly valued income streams of the husband.
Life insurance transfers income across states of nature and thereby alters
the amounts that can be consumed in different states. The optimal choice of
life insurance is thus determined simultaneously with the optimal choice of

state-contingent consumption. If insurance markets are complete and actuarially
fair, life insurance will be purchased (or sold) up to the point that the

marginal utility of consumption is equalized across each state of nature.
Deviations of insurance pricing from actuarially fair values changes the
effective prices of consuming in different states of nature and implies
differences in the marginal utility of consumption across different states.

—21—

These points are illustrated in the equations below.

Our model has two periods. During the first period, both the husband and
wife are alive. During the second period, there are four states of nature,
corresponding to only the husband surviving, only the wife surviving, both

We denote consumption in the first period as

surviving, and neither surviving.

C and, in the three states where at least one member of the family survives, as
In the first period and in state hs in which

Ch, Cw and Chw, respectively.
both spouses are alive, each spouse separately consumes the amount C and Ch,
respectively. If there are no economies to scale, the couple spends 2C and 2Chw
in the first period and in the hw state, respectively. If consumption when
married is a pure public good, the couple spends only C and Chw in the two
states, although each spouse still consumes C and, if they both survive, Chs.
Given the assumption of expected utility maximization, the family's problem iS:

where PS S the probability that spouse s survives, and s equals h or w.
If both the husband and wife purchase positive amounts of insurance, then

the following equations constrain the choice of consumption in the three states

second period, B5 is the spouse's Social Security and pension benefits,
and B*
w is the survivor benefits to which the wife is entitled in the event of

the husband's death. The terms r and A are prices; r is the one period
interest rate, and A is the price of second period joint consumption.

If A =

2,

there are no economies of scale in consumption; if A = 1, household consumption
is a pure public good.

These budget constraints are written under the assumptions that husbands
will not be entitled to survivor benefits and that all private insurance is term

insurance. The former assumption is consistent with the observations in our

sample. The second is more problematic. To the extent that policies are "whole
life" and not term policies, they will have a cash or asset value corresponding

to the insurance policy's previous savings component, or "inside buildup." A
whole life policy may be viewed as a combination of (1) a savings account with
liquid assets equal to the policy's cash value, and (2) term insurance with a
death benefit equal to the difference between the policy's face value and cash

value. If we knew how much cash value each policy had, we would subtract this
from the face value F in equations (4) and add it to A. Unfortunately, no such
information is available. We defer further discussion of this data problem
until the empirical implementation of the model is considered.
In the case of positive insurance purchases for both spouses, we may use

expressions (4h), (4w) and (4hw) to eliminate Fh and F, obtaining a single
expression in consumption levels that may be interpreted as "the" household
budget constraint:

the "prices" of the four consumption

Note how this result differs from what would obtain in the presence of
complete and actuarially fair markets for annuties and life insurance, which
would permit state—contingent purchases of consumption.

In that case, the

present value of resources would equal the sum of the expected values, based on

the associated survivor probabilities, of each of the components of wealth. The
righthand side of (7) differs from the present expected value of resources in
that the survivor benefit B* is multiplied only by the husband's death
probability rather than the product of his death probability and the wife's

survival probability. This is because, without the availability of private
annuities, resources that are available when the husband and wife both die are of

no value. Put another way, the survivor benefit is of the same value as if it

—24—

also paid off when both the husband and the wife die.
The implicit prices for second period state—contingent consumption also
differ from the case of complete, actuarially fair insurance markets. The

prices for Ch and C are higher, representing the fact that, in states in which
one spouse dies, the family must commit resources regardless of whether the

remaining spouse actually lives. This also makes the price of consumption lower
in the state where both survive. The intuition is

that by providing resources

for the state in which both live, the family reduces the amount it must waste in
the state when both die; i.e., increased expenditures for Chw also increase
consumption in the states with one surviving member, so that less direct
expenditures are necessary.

Expected utility maximization by the household of (3) subject to (7) leads
to an optimal Consumption vector that is a function of the implicit prices and
the present value of resources given by the right-hand side of expression (7).

We label these q and PVR. We next derive expressions for the demands for life
insurance. Subtracting expression (4hw) from (4w) yields:
(8h)

Fh = (Cw_AChW) +

(Eh+Bh_B)

while from (4h) and (4hw) we obtain:

(8w)

Fw = (Ch_ACh

)

+ (E+B)

Each expression has a clear interpretation, calling for the purchase of
insurance for the husband or wife equal to the net loss in resources if that
individual dies plus the additional consumption that must be financed. The
latter term may well be negative, depending on the value of A and the tastes

—25—

of the household.

Substituting the optimal consumption demands into expressions (8h) and
(8w) yields demand functions for insurance:

H(q,PVR)

+

(Eh+Bh_B)

(9h)

Fh =

(9w)

Fw = W(q,PVR) + (Ew+Bw)

where H( ) and W( )

are the consumption demands for Ch and C in excess of joint

consumption expenditures when both survive (i.e., C — AChW and Ch -

respectively).
Equations (9h) and (9w) are appropriate when both Fh and F are positive,

since by assumption neither Fh nor F can be negative. We next consider
regimes in which one or both spouses are constrained at zero in the purchase of

life insurance. In such regimes, the couple faces an optimization problem of
reduced dimension, with different implicit prices for consumption and different

weights used to calculate the present value of resources. For example, suppose
that the value of F satisfying (9w) is negative, requiring that it be
constrained to zero. Then, in place of expression (8w) we have;

(8w')

0 =

(Ch_XChw)

+

(E+B),

which implies that the family can no longer independently determine Ch and Chw.
Substituting this restriction into expression (7), we obtain a new budget
constraint that omits ChW:

(7w')

+

+

[(1_ph)/(1+r))CW

[ph/(14')](Ehh)

+

[(1_ph)/(1+r))(Ew+Bw+B)

—26-

Note that the implicit price of the husband's consumption is now the
probability of his own survival, rather than the probability of his wife's

death. Likewise, the wife's wages and benefits are no longer weighted by her
survival probability, but by her husband's death probability. Since only the
husband may buy insurance, his insurance decision determines the allocation of

resources between Ch and C, and the cost of this insurance determines their

relative prices. Since the spouse cannot transfer resources to her husband
through insurance, her survival probability does not enter into the budget
constraint.

Letting

and PVRh be the price vector and present value of resources

given by the righthand side of (7w'), we obtain from (8h) the husband's demand
for life insurance when his wife is constrained at zero life insurance:

(9h')

Fh =

H(qlPVR)

+

(Eh+Bh_B)

In an analagous fashion, we may derive prices

and the present value of

resources PVR for the case where the husband's insurance is constrained to
equal zero, and obtain the wife's demand function for insurance:

F =

(9w')

W(q1PVR)

+

(Ew+Bw)

We thus have four possible regimes:

A.

Husband and wife unconstrained

Fh = H(q,PVR) +
(Eh+Bh_B)

F =
B.

W(q,PVR)

(Ew+Bw)

Fh = 0
Fw =

D.

W(q,PVR)

+

(Ew+Bw)

Both constrained

Fh = 0

F =

0

Estimation of the demand for insurance across these regimes involves a

switching regressions model with censored dependent variables. We discuss
different estimation strategies below.
A problem involved in estimating the insurance demand funtions (9h), (9h' ),

(9w), and (9w') is that our data does not report term insurance, which
corresponds to Fh and F in the equations, but only the face value of
insurance. An alternative approach that is robust to this particular problem is
to estimate expressions (4h) and (4w) directly. Rearranging terms in (4w), and
substituting in the demands for consumption, we obtain:
(lOh)

where H( )

Fh +

is

(A_lThFh_lrF)(l+r)

=

H(q,PVR)

-

(E+B+B*)

the expenditure on first period consumption times (1+r) plus the

wife's second period consumption when widowed (i.e., AC(1+r) +

C).

If we

ignore the insurance premia or assume that assets are measured net of insured
premia, and assume interest rates to be small, then we have in (lOh) an

—28-

expression for the sum of the husband's insurance plus family assets, which does
not require the separation of cash value from term value of insurance.

Equation

(4h) provides a corresponding expression (lOw) for F
(lOw)

Fw + (A7rhFh_irwFw)(l+r)

= W(q,PVR) -

(Eh.i.Bh)

As with the previous insurance demand equations, to estimate

this model

consistently one must allow for different regimes in which the husband's or wife's

insurance demand may be constrained to zero. When the wife's insurance is zero, but
the husband's is positive, H(q,PVR) is replaced by H(q,PVRj, and when the
husband's insurance is zero, but the wife's is positive, the function W(q,PVR)

is replaced by W(qPVB).

IV. Econometric Specification
The model presented -in the previous section can be specified as a

two-indicator switching regression model. Let 1h and

be zero-one indicators

for zero versus positive values of the husband's and wife's insurance,
respectively, and express

(11)

linear combinations of observable economic and demographic characteristic

Ch =

cw = -B ww
X
In (12) Bh and Bw are coefficient vectors. Referring to the discussions of
equations (9) and (10), we express the choices of Fh and F in the four possible

regimes as fo1los:

In (13), (14), and (15), Zh? ZwP Z and Z are vectors of explanatory variables,

Estimation Strategy
We can consistently estimate the econometric model represented by
equations (11) through (16) by first estimating the choice of regimes
(equations (11) and (12)) with a bivariate probit, and then using the results
of this probit to correct for sample selection in the regressions for the

levels of Fh and F in equations (13), (14), and (15). The appropriate Mills
ratio selection correction factors differ in this case from that suggested by
Heckman (1976) since they are based on a bivariate error process. To
illustrate the appropriate Mills ratio formula, consider estimating the

regression for Fh in (13). As derived in the appendix, the expected value of

£h given 1h > 0 and I > 0 iS:

E(c h>°' I >0) = E(ch/Lh>ch,

F(c)],

were independent, the
and (17) would reduce to

the sum of two separate Mills ratios. In this case one could run two separate

probits for 'h > 0 and I > 0 to form E(e/.t > ch) and E(c/i > Cw) However,

when h and

are not independent the term 4(ch,cW) must be estimated from a

bivariate probit.

V.

Empirical Results
In this section, we report estimates for the demands for husbands' and

wives' life insurance for the two models described in the previous section.

We used William Green's LIMDEP routine to estimate the model. LIMOEP
correctly calculates standard errors in the selection equations. The results
are given in Table 8 for husbands and Table 9 for wives.
Of the 5110 total observations in the sample, there are 3351 households
in which both spouses have insurance, 1024 households in which only the
husband has insurance, 128 households in which only the wife has insurance,
and 707 households in wfrich neither family member has positive insurance.

We examine first the results for husbands' life insurance demands. We
examine two samples of households in which the husband's insurance is

positive: those in which wives also purchase positive amounts of insurance,

and those in which wives purchase no insurance. The first two columns in
Table 8 present estimates for Model 1 for the two samples, based on equation

(9h) above. The last two columns present estimates for Model 2, based on

equation (lOh) above. Recall that the second model may be preferred because
it does not require distinguishing the cash and face value of insurance. In
all cases, we include three moments of the present value of family resources,
husband's and wife's age, and interaction terms between these ages and the
present value of family resources to account for the consumption demand
functions H( ) and H( ).

The ages are meant to proxy for the survival

probabilities that determine the state contingent prices of consumption. PVRW,
defined by the righthand side of equation (7), and PVRh, defined by the

righthand side of equation (9w') is used for the regime B sample.

Consider first the results for Model 1 in Table 8. To evaluate the
performance of the model, note that the components of husbands' receipts should
each have a coefficient of 1, and the survivor's benefit should have a

coefficient of -1. Each of these independent variables is calculated as the
present expected value of the relevant income stream. For the sample in which
the wife's insurance is positive, the coefficients of the husband's earnings,
Social Security and pension benefits have the wrong sign, while survivor
benefits has the right sign but is over 7 standard deviations from -1. The
results are somewhat better in the sample in which the wife's insurance is zero;
these coefficients, while positive and significant, are, however, significantly

below 1. For this sample the wife's survivor benefits has the wrong sign. The
two bivariate mills ratios are highly significant for both samples. Note that
the standard errors of the coefficients tend, in general, to be quite small
implying a fairly precise rejection of the theoretical model.
The estimates for Model 2 are not much closer to those predicted by the
theoretical model. The model predicts that the wife's social security benefits,
survivor benefits, and earnings should all enter with a coefficient of —1;
in the two subsampleS only 4 of the 8 coefficients have the correct negative

sign, and only 2 are significant. The large -4.39 coefficient in the model 2
hard to take
Fw < 0 regression for the wife's social security benefits is

seriously in light of these other results. The net worth variable (A) is
positive in both samples, although very small in absolute value; recall its

predicted value is -1. The overall goodness of fit for Model 2 is quite
similar to that for Model 1.

—33—

Table 9 presents estimates for the analagous two models of wivest demands

for life insurance. The two samples considered (all for wives who have
positive life insurance) are for husbands who have insurance, and husbands who

have no insurance. The second sample is quite small, as one would expect,
containing only 128 households.
In the two models, the components of husbands' and wives' earnings and

benefits enter with the correct signs in 8 of 10 cases, and 7 of these 8

coefficients are significant. However, none of these coefficients is close to
1 'in absolute value. As in Table 8 standard errors are

typically quite small.

The results for Model 2 in which the husbands have zero insurance come closest

to the theoretical prediction. For this sample each of the husand's streams as
well as net worth have negative coefficients as predicted and are significant.

VI. Conclusions
A significant minority of elderly households appear to have inadequate

amounts of life insurance. In addition, estimates of life insurance demand
functions are, to a very large extent, at odds with theoretical predictions.

There appears to be little systematic response of private life insurance
holdings to social security's provision of survivor benefits, hence, social
security is apparently effective 'in raising the welfare of widows and widowers
through its provision of survivor insurance.

The surprisingly poor econometric results make us even more skeptical
concerning the quality of the RHS data than when we started working on the

paper. We intend to estimate the model using the SRI survey of the finances of
higher income middle age and older households. The quality of these data may

voluntary survey.

Given the significant poverty rates among elderly widows, this paper
suggests the need for a reevaluation of the appropriate size of survivor
benefits relative to retirement benefits under the social security system.

it

also suggests that poverty among elderly widows could be reduced by government
programs aimed at increasing private purchase of life insurance.
