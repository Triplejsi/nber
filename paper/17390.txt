ABSTRACT
Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the US have relied on Corporate Average Fuel Economy
(CAFE) Standards and Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS). Economists often argue that these policies
are inefficient relative to carbon pricing because they ignore existing vehicles and do not adequately
reduce the incentive to drive. This paper presents evidence that the net social costs of carbon pricing
are significantly less than previous thought. The bias arises from the fact that the demand elasticity
for miles travelled varies systematically with vehicle emissions; dirtier vehicles are more responsive
to changes in gasoline prices. This is true for all four emissions for which we have data—nitrogen
oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and greenhouse gases—as well as weight. This reduces the
net social costs associated with carbon pricing through increasing the co-benefits. Accounting for this
heterogeneity implies that the welfare losses from $1.00 gas tax, or a $110 per ton of CO2 tax, are
negative over the period of 1998 to 2008 even when we ignore the climate change benefits from the
tax. Co-benefits increase by over 60 percent relative to ignoring the heterogeneity that we document.
In addition, accounting for this heterogeneity raises the optimal gas tax associated with local pollution,
as calculated by Parry and Small (2005), by as much as 57 percent. While our empirical setting is California,
we present evidence that the effects may be larger for the rest of the US.

Introduction

As concerns about climate change grow, so have debates about what policy tools to use to reduce
emissions. The transportation sector accounts for nearly 37 percent of US greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and has seen a number of policy changes during the past two decades. Within the
transportation industry, greenhouse gas pricing, via either a carbon tax or cap and trade system,
has succumbed to Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to increase the new vehicle
fleet fuel economy and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to decrease the carbon intensity of
fuels. Economists have long viewed these policies with derision, arguing instead for the merits of
Pigouvian taxes.
A large literature exists showing the ineﬃciency associated with both CAFE and the RFS,
relative to gasoline or carbon taxes. For the RFS, the main sources of ineﬃciency are that the
policy over-incentivizes marginally cleaner fuels and suppresses fuel prices. CAFE, on the other
hand, ignores the existing fleet and reduces the marginal cost of driving, increasing the number of
miles driven. For example, Holland et al. (2011) find that even in the long run GHG reductions
under the RFS are nearly three times more costly than equivalent reduction under a cap and trade
system, while Jacobsen (2011) finds that CAFE standards are nearly seven times more costly than
gasoline taxes in reducing GHG emissions.
In this paper we argue that the net social cost of GHG taxes have been over stated. The source
of this bias comes from heterogeneity in how diﬀerent types of vehicles, in terms of the other externalities associated with driving, respond to changes in gasoline prices. We show that vehicles with
higher externalities, both in terms of local pollution and weight, respond more to gasoline prices.
This is true for all three vehicle emissions for which we have data: carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons,
and nitrogen oxides, as well as for vehicle weight and greenhouse gases. This heterogeneity increases
the co-benefits from reductions in criteria pollutants1 that are associated with a greenhouse gas
tax.
We find that the average “two-year” elasticity of miles travelled is 0.26 across all vehicles, but
the ratio of the elasticity for the dirtiest quarter of vehicles with the cleanest quarter of vehicles is
4.7, 4.5, and 3.4 for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, respectively. The ratio
is 1.6 for greenhouse gases and 1.2 for vehicle weight. We also estimate how the hazard rate of
1
Criteria air pollutants are the only air pollutants for which the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established national air quality standards defining allowable ambient air concentrations. Congress
has focused regulatory attention on these pollutants (i.e., carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate
matter, and sulfur dioxide) because they endanger public health and they are widespread throughout the U.S.

scrapping a vehicle varies with criteria pollutant emissions. Here, the evidence is more mixed.
We use these estimates to simulate the co-benefits from a carbon tax. For each vehicle in
our data, we calculate the change in miles driven from the tax and the change in the vehicle’s
probability of survival and the resulting change in vehicle emissions. We do this across our entire
time period and in each year. We then quantify these reductions using the estimated marginal
damages in Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) and Matthews and Lave (2000). We find that once
the heterogeneous response is accounted for, there is essentially no change in near-term consumer
surplus from a $110 CO2 tax from 1998 to 2008; the welfare near-term co-benefits are nearly 20
percent greater than the deadweight loss from the tax increase. If one fails to account for the
heterogenous response, the simulated co-benefits fall to 74 percent of the consumer welfare loss
from the tax. We discuss reasons why these eﬀects should be interpreted as strict lower bounds.
Given that the vehicle fleet has become cleaner over time, in terms of criteria pollutant emissions,
we find that the co-benefits have fallen over our sample, but remain substantial even at the end.
Early in the sample, we simulate that consumers would have been better oﬀ from the tax, with the
co-benefits being twice as large as the welfare losses from the tax. In the last year of our sample,
the co-benefits fall to 55 percent of the welfare losses from the tax. We argue that these are still
substantial, reducing the cost per ton of carbon saved from $83 to $23. Again, not accounting for
heterogeneity implies a net cost nearly twice as large as the net cost accounting for heterogeneity
in the final year of our sample. To put these numbers into context, Greenstone, Kopits, and
Wolverton (2011) estimate the social cost of carbon to be between $21.40 and $64.90, depending
on the assumptions made.
Our results also have implications for the optimal gas tax in the presence of multiple market
failures. Parry and Small (2005) calculate that the optimal gasoline tax within the US accounting
for local and global pollution, accidents, congestion, and ineﬃciencies associated with income taxes.
They find that the optimal tax is $1.01 in the US, while it is $1.62 in the UK. We calculate the
optimal gas tax for California with and without heterogeneity; with heterogeneity the optimal tax
increases from $0.92 to $1.05 in 1998 and from $0.85 to $0.90 in 2008. The relatively small increase
is due, in large part, to the fact that the Pigouvian tax associated with congestion dominates the
tax. The portion of the optimal tax attributed to local pollution increases from $0.22 to $0.33 in
1998 and from $0.08 to $0.13 in 2008, a change of 52 and 57 percent, respectively. We argue that
these results should be viewed as strict lower bounds of the co-benefits for a variety of reasons.
We also present evidence that, while the marginal damages from NOx and HCs are larger
2

within California, Californian vehicles are, on average, much cleaner that the rest of the US. We
show, using county-level data from the EPA on average vehicle emission rates, that the county-level
average per-mile externalities are roughly 30 percent lower in California compared to the rest of
the US. Therefore, while are unable to estimate elasticities outside of California, this suggests that
provided the heterogeneity is somewhat similar to what we observe in California, the co-benefits
may be larger for other states.
Finally, we also investigate several sources of the heterogeneity. At the most general level, we
show that while the age of the vehicle is a major driver in our results—older vehicles respond
more to changes in gasoline prices—this does not explain all of the heterogeneity. There are at
least two additional sources of criteria pollutant-related heterogeneity in the response of changes in
gasoline prices. For one, income may be correlated with criteria pollutant emissions, and driving
the diﬀerence. Second, it may come from within-household shifts in vehicles miles travelled, for
example if a household has one newer and one older vehicle. As gas prices increase, they may shift
miles away from the older vehicle and to the newer vehicle. Because age is, on average, correlated
with both greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions, this would lead to our result. Our data
can speak to this. We find that while there is evidence of both a within household eﬀect and an
income eﬀect, a significant amount of variation persists once these are accounted for.
We bring together a number of unique data sets. The first is the universe of test records for
California’s emissions inspection and maintenance program, Smog Check, for the period of 1996 to
2010. California requires vehicles older than six years to receive biennial testing. In addition, testing
occurs each time a vehicle changes ownership and randomly for a small share of vehicles. Among
other things, the inspection data report odometer readings, which we use to measure vehicle miles
travelled between tests. The tests also measure criteria pollutant emissions. To measure greenhouse
gas emissions, we link these data to EPA fuel economy ratings. In addition, the data are linked to
EIA gas prices for the same years. For roughly 75 percent of the smog check records, we are able to
link them to Department of Motor Vehicle address recordings. This allows us to aggregate vehicles
to households, as well as match vehicles with Census tract demographic data. Finally, to capture
scrappage decisions we use CARFAX data for roughly 32 million vehicles that track the last date
a vehicle was recorded within the US or exported to a foreign country.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the empirical setting. The data are discussed
in Section 3. Section 4 provides graphical support for the empirical results. Sections 5 and 6 present
empirical models and results on miles driven and scrappage. Section 7 presents the results from
3

the two policy simulations. Section 8 discusses how our results apply to regions of the US outside
of California. Finally, Section 9 concludes the paper.

Empirical Setting

Our empirical setting is California. California implemented its first inspection and maintenance
program in 1984 in response to the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments. The initial incarnation of
the Smog Check program relied purely on a decentralized system of privately run, state-licensed
inspection stations, and was plagued by cheating and lax inspections. Although the agreement
between California and the federal EPA promised reductions in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide
emissions of more the 25 percent, estimates of actual reductions of the early Smog Check Program
range from zero to half that amount (Glazer, Klein, and Lave (1995)).
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required states to implement an enhanced inspection and
maintenance program in areas with serious to extreme non-attainment of ozone limits. Several of
California’s urban areas fell into this category, and in 1994, a redesigned inspection program was
passed by California’s legislature after reaching a compromise with the EPA. The program was
updated in 1997 to address consumer complaints, and fully implemented by 1998. Among other
improvements, California’s new program introduced a system of centralized “Test-Only” stations
and an electronic transmission system for inspection reports.2 Today, more than a million Smog
Checks take place each month.
An automobile appears in the data for a number of reasons. First, vehicles that are older than
four years old must pass a smog check within 90 days of any change in ownership. Second, in parts
of the state (details below) an emissions inspection is required every other year as a pre-requisite
for renewing the registration on a vehicle that is six years old or older. Third, a test is required if
a vehicle moves from out-of-state. Vehicles which fail an inspection must be repaired and receive
another inspection before they can be registered and driven in the state. There is also a group
of exempt vehicles. These are: vehicles of 1975 model-year or older, hybrid and electric vehicles,
motorcycles, diesel powered vehicles, and large trucks powered by natural gas.
Since 1998, the state has been divided into three inspection regimes (recently expanded to
four), the boundaries of which roughly correspond to the jurisdiction of the regional Air Quality
Management Districts. “Enhanced” regions, designated because they fail to meet state or federal
standards for carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone, fall under the most restrictive regime. All of the

state’s major urban centers are in Enhanced areas, including the greater Los Angeles, San Francisco,
and San Diego metropolitan areas. Vehicles registered to an address in an Enhanced area must pass
a biennial Smog Check in order to be registered, and they must take the more rigorous Acceleration
Simulation Mode (ASM) test. The ASM test involves the use of a dynamometer, and allows for
measurement of NOx emissions. In addition, a randomly selected two percent sample of all vehicles
in these areas is directed to have their Smog Checks at Test-Only stations, which are not allowed
to make repairs.3 Vehicles which match a “High Emitter Profile” are also directed to Test-Only
stations, as are vehicles which are flagged as “gross polluters” (this occurs when a vehicle fails an
inspection with twice the legal limit of one or more pollutant in its emissions). More recently some
“Partial-Enhanced” areas have been added, where a biennial ASM test is required, but no vehicles
are directed to Test-Only stations.
Areas with poor air quality that does not exceed legal limits fall under the Basic regime. Cars
in a Basic area must have biennial Smog Checks as part of registration, but they are allowed to
take the simpler Two Speed Idle (TSI) test, and no vehicles are directed to Test-Only stations. The
least restrictive regime, consisting of rural mountain and desert counties in the east and north of
the state, is known as the Change of Ownership area. As the name suggests, inspections in these
areas are only required upon change of ownership; no biennial Smog Check is required.

2.1

Automobiles, Criteria Pollutants, and Health

The tests report the emissions of three criteria pollutant: Nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbon, and carbon
monoxide. All three of these pollutants are a direct consequences of the combustion process within
either gasoline or diesel engines. Both NOx and HCs are precursors to ground-level ozone, but, as
with CO, have been shown to have negative health eﬀects individually.4
While numerous studies have found links between the exposure of either smog or these three
pollutants directly and health outcomes, the direct mechanisms are still uncertain. These pollutants, as well as smog, may directly impact vital organs or indirectly cause trauma. For example,
CO can bind to hemoglobin, thereby decreasing the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream. High
levels of carbon monoxide have also been linked to heart and respiratory problems. NOx reacts
with other compounds to create nitrate aerosols, which are fine-particle particulate matter (PM).
3

Other vehicles can be taken to Test-Only stations as well if the owner chooses, although they must get repairs
elsewhere if they fail.
4
CO has also been shown to speed up the smog-formation process. For early work on this, see Westberg, Cohen,
and Wilson (1971).

5

PM has been shown to irritate lung tissue, lowers lung capacity and hinders long term-lung development. Extremely small PM can be absorbed through the lung tissue and cause damage on the
cellular level. On its own, HC can interfere with oxygen intake and irritate lungs. Ground-level
ozone is a known lung irritant, has been associated with lowered lung capacity, and can exacerbate
existing prior heart problems as well as lung problems such as asthma or allergies.

Data

We bring together a number of large data sets. First, we have the universe of smog checks from 1996
to 2010 from California’s Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR). These data report the location of
the test, the vehicle’s VIN, odometer reading, the reason for the test, and test results. We decode
the VIN to obtain the vehicles’ make, model, engine, and transmission. Using this, we match the
vehicles to EPA data on fuel economy. Because the VIN decoding only holds for vehicles made
after 1981, our data are restricted to these models. We also restrict our sample to 1998 and beyond
given the large changes that occurred in the smog check test program in 1997. This yields roughly
120 million observations.
The smog check data report nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in terms of parts per million and
carbon monoxide levels as a percentage of the exhaust under two engine revolutions per minute
(RPMs). The more relevant metric is a vehicles emissions per mile. We convert the smog check
reading into emissions per mile using conversion equations developed by Sierra Research for California Air Resources Board for Morrow and Runkle (2005), an evaluation of the Smog Check program.
The conversion equations are functions of all three pollutants, vehicle weight, model year, and truck
status.
We also estimate scrappage decisions. For this we use data from CARFAX Inc. for 32 million
of the vehicles in the BAR data. These data report the last date and location a given vehicle was
recorded by CARFAX in the United States, which includes registrations, emissions inspections,
repairs, import/export records and accidents. The CARFAX data do not track vehicles that move
outside of the US; we assume the vehicle continues to be driven if exported.
At times we use information about the household. For a subsample of our BAR data, we
are able to match vehicles to given households using data come from confidential Department of
Motor Vehicle records that track the registered address of the vehicle. We use this information to
aggregate up to addresses, the stock of vehicles registered. Appendix A discusses how this is done.
These data are from 2000 to 2008.
6

Finally, we use gasoline prices from EIA’s weekly California average price series to construct
average prices between Smog Check.
Table 1 reports means and standard deviations of the main variables used in our analysis, as well
as these summary statistics split by vehicle vintage and 1998 and 2008. The average fuel economy
of vehicles in our sample is 23.5 MPG, with fuel economy falling over our sample. The change in
the average dollar per mile has been dramatic, more than doubling over our sample. The dramatic
decrease in vehicle emissions is also clear in the data, with per-mile emissions of hydrocarbon, CO,
and NOx falling considerable from 1998 to 2008. The tightening of standards has also meant that
more vehicles fail the smog check late in the sample, although some of this is driven by the aging
vehicle fleet.

Preliminary Evidence

One of the main driving forces behind our empirical results is whether vehicle elasticities, both
in terms of their intensive and extensive margins, vary systematically with the magnitude of their
externalities. In this section, we present evidence that:
◦ significant variation exists in terms of vehicle externalities across vehicles within a year,
◦ significant variation exists in terms of vehicle externalities across vehicles across years,

◦ significant variation exists in terms of vehicle externalities within the same make, model,
model year, etc. within a year, and
◦ simple statistics, such as the average miles travelled by vehicle type, suggest that elasticities
are correlated with externalities.
Figure 1 plots the distributions of NOx , HCs, and CO emissions in 1998, 2004, and 2010.
The distribution of criteria pollutant emissions tends to be right-skewed in any given year, with a
standard deviation equal to roughly one to three times the mean, depending on the pollutant. This
implies that there are a vehicles on the road that are quite “dirty” relative to the mean vehicle.
Over time, the distribution has shifted to the left, as vehicles have been getting cleaner, but the
range still remains.
Table 2 reports the means and standard deviations across all vehicles receiving smog checks in a
given year. From 1998 to 2008 the average emissions of NOx , HCs, and CO fell between 65 and 85
percent. However, the standard deviations, relative to the means, have increased over time. This
is especially true for CO, where the standard deviation is over 4 times the mean at the end of the
sample.

7

This variation is not only driven by the fact that diﬀerent types of vehicles are on the road in a
given year, but also variation within the same vehicle type, defined as a make, model, model-year,
engine, number of doors, and drivetrain combination. To see this, Figure 2 plots the distributions
of emissions for the most popular vehicle/year in our sample, the 2001 4-door Toyota Corolla in
2009. The vertical red line is at the mean of the distribution. Here, again, we see that even within
the same vehicle-type in the same year, the distribution is wide and right skewed. The distribution
of hydrocarbons is less skewed, but the standard deviation is 25 percent of the mean. Carbon
monoxide is also less skewed, and has a standard deviation that is 36 percent of the mean. Across
all years and vehicles, the mean emission rate of a given vehicle in a given year, on average, is
roughly four times the standard deviation for all three pollutants (Table 2).
To understand how the distribution within a given vehicle changes over time, Figure 3 plots
the distribution of the 1995 3.8L, front-wheel drive, Ford Windstar in 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2007.5
These figures suggest that over time the distributions shift to the right, become more symmetric,
and the standard deviation grows considerably, relative to the mean. Across all vehicles, the ratio
of the mean emission rate of NOx and the standard deviation of NOx has increased from 3.16 in
1998 to 4.53 in 2010. For hydrocarbons, this has increased from 3.59 to 5.51; and, has increased
from 3.95 to 5.72 for CO.
These distributions demonstrate that there is significant variation in emissions across vehicles
and within vehicle type, and thus significant scope for meaningful emissions-correlated variation in
elasticities along those lines. We next present suggestive evidence that this is the case. To do this,
we categorize vehicles into four groups, based on the four quartiles of a given pollutant within a
given year. We then plot how the log of daily miles driven has changed over our sample—a period
where gas prices increased from roughly $1.35 to $3.20.
Figure 4 and 5 foreshadow our results on the intensive margin. Figure 4 plots the median of
daily miles travelled across our sample split up by the emissions quartile of the vehicle. While the
dirtiest quartile begins at a slightly lower daily-VMT, it appears to drop much further than the
other quartiles. Indeed, the there is a general trend of monotonicity across the four emissions. To
see this more clearly, Figure 5 rescales the median VMT in 1998 and plots the average of the log of
VMT over time by quartiles of each pollutant. For each pollutant, the log change in bottom-quartile
vehicles is larger than the first quartile, with the other two quartiles often exhibiting monotonic
5

We chose this vehicle because the 1995 3.8L, front-wheel drive, Ford Windstar in 1999 is the second most popular
entry in our data and it is old enough that we can track it over four 2-year periods.

Vehicle Miles Travelled Decisions

Our first set of empirical models estimates how vehicle miles travelled (VMT) decisions are aﬀected
by changes in gas prices, and how this elasticity varies with vehicle characteristics. Our empirical
approach mirrors Figures 4 to 5. For each vehicle receiving a biennial smog check, we calculate
average daily miles driven and the average gasoline price during the roughly two years between
smog checks. We will then allow the elasticity to vary based on the emissions of the vehicle. We
begin by estimating:
ln(V M Tijgt ) = β ln(DP Mijgt ) + γDtruck +

�

ωk · time + µt + µj + µg + µv + �igt

(1)

where i indexes vehicles, j vehicle-types, g geographic locations, t time, and v vehicle age, or
vintage. DP Mijgt is the average dollars per mile of the vehicle between smog checks, Dtruck is an
indicator for whether the vehicle is a truck, and time is a time trend.6
We begin the analysis by including year, vintage, and zip code fixed eﬀects. We then progressively include finer vehicle-type fixed eﬀects by including make, then make/model/modelyear/engine, and ending with individual vehicle fixed eﬀects.
We next diﬀerentiate the influence of gas prices by vehicle attributes related to the magnitude
of their negative externalities—criteria pollutants, CO2 emissions, and weight. We do this in two
ways. First, we split vehicles up by the quartile the vehicle falls into with respect to the withinyear emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx ), hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO), fuel
economy (CO2 ), and weight. Second, we include a linear interaction of these variables and the log
of gas prices. Below we investigate, in a semi-parametric way, the actual functional form of this
relationship.
Tables 3 through 7 report the results across externality-type.
Model 1 controls for only the year, vintage of the vehicle, and zip code where the vehicle received
its smog check. Model 2 adds vehicle-make fixed eﬀects. Model 3 includes the quartile interactions
and the quartiles themselves. Model 4 includes VIN-prefix fixed eﬀects which eﬀectively are vehicle
make/model/model year/drivetrain/engine fixed eﬀects. Model 5 includes individual vehicle fixed
eﬀects. Model 6 includes the quartile variables, and Model 7 allows for the relationship between

Our dollars per mile variable uses the standard assumption that 45 percent of a vehicle miles driven are in the
city and 55 percent are on the highway, along with the vehicles EPA fuel economy ratings.

externality and gas prices to be linear.
Table 3 focuses on nitrogen oxides. Moving from Models 1 to 5 illustrates the importance of
controlling for vehicle-type fixed eﬀects. Initially, the average elasticity falls from 0.399 to 0.140
when including fixed make eﬀects, but then rises when including finer detailed vehicle fixed eﬀects.
Our final specification includes individual vehicle fixed eﬀects yielding an average elasticity of 0.257.7
In general, we find that the more finely we control for vehicle-type the larger the heterogeneity in
terms of the dollar-per-mile elasticity, while the average elasticity does not change much once we
control for the vehicle’s make. Focusing on Models 6 and 7, we find large heterogeneity. The DPMelasticity for the cleanest vehicles, quartile one, is 0.094, while the DPM-elasticity for the dirtiest
vehicles is over five times this, at 0.323. To put these numbers in context, the average per-mile
NOx emissions of a quartile one vehicle is 0.163 grams, while the average per-mile NOx emissions
of a quartile four vehicle is 1.68 grams. Model 7 assumes the relationship is linear in centiles of
NOx and finds that each percentile increase in the per-mile NOx emission rate is associated with a
change in the elasticity of .003, from a base of 0.078.
We find similar patterns across the three other pollutants. Table 4 reports the results for
hydrocarbons. Here, the elasticity of the cleanest vehicles and the elasticity of the dirtiest vehicles
diﬀer by a factor of 4.5. Table 5 reports the results for carbon monoxide. Here there ratio is almost
4.7. Table 6 reports the results for fuel economy, or CO2 emissions. The lowest quartile here are
the most polluting vehicles. Their elasticity is 1.6 times as large as the cleanest vehicles. It is
important to note that this is not driven by the fact that a given change in gas prices implies a
larger change in the price per miles, since the independent variable is the log of the price per mile.8
The linear interaction implies that vehicles at the 100th percentile have an average elasticity of
roughly zero. We come back to this below.
While the elasticities are larger for dirtier vehicles, the average miles driven are smaller at
the beginning of the sample for these vehicles. In terms of levels, in 1998 vehicles in the bottom
quartile in terms of NOx emissions are driven 2.23 more miles per day, on average, than vehicles in
the top quartile; they are driven 0.10 and 1.03 miles more per day, on average, than vehicles in the
second and third quartiles, respectively. Vehicles in the bottom quartile in terms of hydrocarbon
emissions are driven 0.95 miles per day less, on average, than vehicles in the second quartile and
3.28 and 4.68 miles more, on average, than vehicles in the third and fourth quartiles, respectively
7

This is much larger than that found in Hughes, Knittel, and Sperling (2008) reflecting the longer run nature of
our elasticity.
8
Also, note that this does not matter for the models with VIN fixed eﬀects.

10

(in 1998). Vehicles in the bottom quartile in terms of CO emissions are driven 3.00 miles per day
less, on average, than vehicles in the second quartile, and 7.63 and 4.63 miles more, on average, than
vehicles in the third and fourth quartiles, respectively (in 1998). Finally, vehicles in the bottom
quartile in terms of fuel economy are driven 2.44, 2.04, and 1.7 miles per day more, on average,
than vehicles in the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively (in 1998). We account for
these diﬀerences in the policy simulations below.
Table 7 splits vehicles up into weight quartiles. Here, too, we find that those vehicles with the
largest negative externality, heavier vehicles, are more responsive to changes in gas prices. However,
the heterogeneity is not as stark.
We next investigate the functional forms of these relationships in a semi-parametric way. For
each externality, we define vehicles by their percentile of that externality. We then estimate equation
1 with separate elasticities for vehicles falling in the zero to first percentile, first to second, etc.
Figure 7 plots a LOWESS smoothed line through these 100 separate elasticity estimates. For
the three criteria pollutants, we find that the relationship is quite linear with the elasticity being
positive for the cleanest 20 percent of vehicles. The dirtiest vehicles have elasticities that are
roughly 0.4. For fuel economy, the relationship is fairly linear from the 60th percentile onwards,
but begins steeply and flattens out from the 20th percentile to the 40th. The elasticity of the lowest
fuel economy vehicles is nearly 0.6. To put these numbers into context across the diﬀerent years,
the average fuel economy of the 20th percentile is 18.7, while the average for the 40th percentile
is 21.75. The variation in elasticities across weight is not monotonic. The relationship begins by
increasing until roughly the 20th percentile, and then falls more or less linearly thereafter. The
elasticity of the heaviest vehicles is roughly 0.3.
Note that the roughly-linear relationship between criteria pollutant emissions and the elasticity
is not due to “over smoothing”. Figure 8 plots the LOWESS smoothed lines under diﬀerent
bandwidths. The top left figure simply reports the 100 elasticities. There is some evidence that
the relationship is not monotonic early on, but from the 5th percentile on, the relationship appears
monotonic. Doing this exercise for the other criteria pollutants yields similar results.

5.1

The Source of the Heterogeneity

While the co-pollutant benefits accrue regardless of the mechanism behind the heterogeneity, it is
of independent interest to investigate the mechanism. We investigate three sources, which are not
necessarily independent of each other. First, it may be driven entirely through a vintage eﬀect.

11

That is, older vehicles are both more responsive to changes in gas prices and have higher emissions.
Second, it might be driven by diﬀerences in the incomes of consumers that drive dirtier versus
cleaner vehicles. Third, it may result from households shifting which of their vehicles are driven in
the face of rising gasoline prices.
To investigate whether it is simply a vintage eﬀect, we redefine the quartiles based on the
distribution of emissions within vintage bins. We split vehicles into three age categories: 4 to 9
years old, 10 to 15 years old, and 16 to 27 years old.
Tables 8 through 11 report the results across externality-type. These results suggest that while
vintage is an important driver in the externality-based heterogeneity, it is not the only source. In
all four externality types variation exists within age bin; furthermore, in all but fuel economy this
variation would appear to be economically significant.
For a sub-sample of our smog check vehicles, we are able to group them into households. This
grouping comes from access to California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) data. A number
of steps are undertaken to “clean” the address entries in the DMV records. These are discussed
in Appendix A. Ultimately, however, the subsample of vehicles that we are able to match likely
draw more heavily from households residing in single-family homes. Given this selection, it is not
surprising that we find average elasticities that diﬀer from those presented above. In particular,
they are smaller suggesting that the elasticity may be correlated with income.
The results from this sample are presented in Table 13. For this sample, we construct two
additional variables meant to capture the household stock of vehicles. The variable “Higher MPG
in HH” equals one if there is another vehicle in the household that has a higher MPG rating than
the vehicle at question. Likewise, the variable “lower MPG in HH” equals one if there is another
vehicle in the household that has a lower MPG rating than the vehicle at question.
If household shift usage from low MPG vehicles to high MPG vehicles, we would expect “Higher
MPG in HH” to be negative and “Lower MPG in HH” to be positive. The results suggest that
this is a mechanism, but not the only one. If there is a vehicle with higher fuel economy in the
household, the elasticity is larger, while if there is a vehicle with a lower MPG, the elasticity is
smaller. Column 2 of Table 13 adds these variables to our base specification. The point estimates
suggest that a vehicle in the highest fuel economy quartile belonging to a household that also has
a lower fuel economy vehicle has a near zero elasticity.9
9

The sum of the two vehicle-stock variables is positive, but because lower fuel eﬃcient vehicles are driven more
earlier in the sample, the elasticities are not comparable in terms of what they imply for total miles driven.

12

For this same sample of vehicles, we also use the Census-tract information to categorize owners
into income quartiles. We interact these quartiles with the log of dollars per mile to see if diﬀerences
in elasticities exist. Column 3 of Table 13 adds these interaction terms. There is some evidence that
higher income consumers are less elastic, but these eﬀects are not enough to reverse the emissions
quartile eﬀects; vehicles in the bottom quartile remain nearly three times more sensitive even after
accounting for income diﬀerences.
Our smog check data report the zip code of the testing station the vehicle visited. For our
more general sample, we can also use this information to construct measures of income. Table 14
compares these results with the DMV data. We find similar diﬀerences in the elasticities, despite
the larger average elasticity. That is, the average elasticity of the top income quartile vehicles is
roughly 0.03 less elastic, than the bottom quartile, in both samples.

Scrappage Decisions

Our next set of empirical models examine how vehicle owners’ decisions to scrap their vehicles are
aﬀected by gasoline prices. Again we will also examine how this eﬀect varies over emissions profiles.
We determine whether a vehicle has been scrapped using the data from CARFAX Inc. We
begin by assuming that a vehicle has been scrapped if more than a year has passed between the
last CARFAX record and the date when CARFAX produced our data extract (October 1, 2010).
However, we treat a vehicle as being censored if the last CARFAX record was not in California, or if
more than a year and a half passed between the last Smog Check in our data and the last CARFAX
record. As well, to avoid treating late registrations as scrappage, we treat all vehicles with Smog
Checks after 2008 as censored. Finally, to be sure we are dealing with scrapping decisions and not
accidents or other events, we only examine vehicles which are at least 10 years old.
Some modifications to our data are necessary. To focus on the long-run response to gasoline
prices, our model is specified in discrete time, denominated in years. Where vehicles have more
than one Smog Check per calendar year, we use the last Smog Check in that year. Also, since it is
generally unlikely that a vehicle is scrapped at the same time as its last Smog Check, we create an
additional observation for scrapped vehicles either one year after the last Smog Check, or 6 months
after the last CARFAX record, whichever is later. For these created observations, odometer is
imputed based on the average VMT between the last two Smog Checks, and all other variables
take their values from the vehicle’s last Smog Check. An exception is if a vehicle fails the last Smog
Check in our data. In this case, we assume the vehicle was scrapped by the end of that year.
13

Because many scrapping decisions will not take place until after our data ends, a hazard model
is needed to deal with right censoring. Let Tjivg be the year in which vehicle i, of vehicle type j,
vintage v, and geography g is scrapped. Assuming proportional hazards, our basic model is:
Pr[t < Tijvg < t + 1|T > t] = h0jv (t) · exp{βxDP Migt + γDf ailit + ψGigt + αXit },
where DP Migt is defined as before, Df ailit is a dummy equal to one if the vehicle failed a Smog
Check any time during year t, G is a vector of demographic variables, determined by the location
of the Smog Check, X is a vector of vehicle characteristics, including a dummy for truck and a
6th-order polynomial in odometer, and h0ijv (t) is the baseline hazard rate, which varies by time but
not the other covariates. In some specifications, we will allow each vehicle type and vintage to have
its own baseline hazard rate.
We estimate this model using semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards regressions, leaving
the baseline hazard unspecified. We report exponentiated coeﬃcients, which may be interpreted as
hazard ratios. For instance, a 1 unit increase in DPM will multiply the hazard rate by exp{β}, or
increase by (exp{β} − 1) percent. In practice, we scale the coeﬃcients on DPM for a 5-cent change,

corresponding to a $1.00 increase in gasoline prices for a vehicle with fuel economy of 20 miles per
gallon.
Tables 15 and 16 show the results of our hazard analysis. Models 1 and 2 assign all vehicles to
the same baseline hazard function. Model 1 allows the eﬀect of gas prices to vary by whether or not
a vehicle failed a Smog Check. Model 2 also allows the eﬀect of gas prices to vary by externality
quartiles as well.10 Models 3 and 4 are similar, but stratify the baseline hazard function, allowing
each VIN prefix to have its own baseline hazard function. Finally, Model 5 allows the eﬀect of
gasoline prices to vary both by externality quartile and age group, separating vehicles 10 to 15
years old from vehicles 16 years and older.
Table 15 focuses on heterogeneity across emissions of NOx . Models 1 and 2 indicate that
increases in gasoline prices actually decrease scrapping on average, with the cleanest vehicles seeing
the largest decreases. The eﬀect is diminished once unobserved heterogeneity among vehicle types
is controlled for. In Models 3 and 4, the decrease in the hazard rate from a 5 cent increase in
dollars per mile is statistically insignificant, and while there are diﬀerences among NOx quartiles
in model 4, we cannot reject the hypothesis that they are equal. Instead, the heterogeneity in the
eﬀect of gasoline prices on hazard seems to be over age groups. Model 5 shows that when the cost
10

Quartiles in these models are calculated by year among only vehicles 10 years and older.

14

of driving a mile increases by 5 cents, the hazard of scrappage decreases by about 20% for vehicles
between 10 and 15 years old, while it increases by around 7% for vehicles age 16 and older, with
little variation across NOx quartiles within age groups. This suggests that when gasoline prices
rise, very old cars are scrapped, increasing demand for moderately old cars and thus reducing the
chance that they are scrapped. Results with HC and CO quartiles produce almost identical results.
Table 16 focuses on heterogeneity in fuel economy. Moving from model 2 to model 4, we see
that heterogeneity appears when we stratify by VIN prefix, although the form is counter-intuitive.
A 5-cent increase in DPM increases the hazard of scrappage by about 18% for the most fuel eﬃcient
vehicles, while deceasing the hazard of scrappage by about 17% for the most fuel eﬃcient vehicles.
Because we stratify by VIN prefix in model 4, this cannot be explained by diﬀerences in vehicle
types, such as trucks surviving longer than cars. Model 5 shows that most but not all of these
diﬀerences can be explained by diﬀerences in vehicle age. We cannot reject the hypothesis of no
heterogeneity across MPG quartiles for vehicles age 10 to 15, but we can for vehicles age 16 and
greater, where it seems that the hazard rate increases most for vehicles in the second and third
quartiles.
In summary, increases in the cost of driving a mile over the long term increase the chance that
old vehicles are scrapped, while middle aged vehicles are scrapped less, perhaps because of increased
demand. Although vehicle age is highly correlated with emissions of criteria pollutants, there is
little variation in the response to gasoline prices across emissions rates within age groups.

Policy Simulations

We use our empirical results to inform policy in two ways. First, we calculate the co-benefits
associated with a gasoline, or carbon dioxide, tax in the transportation sector. Second, we extend
the work by Parry and Small (2005) and calculate the optimal gasoline tax when one considers the
heterogeneity in the VMT-elasticity.

7.1

Co-benefits and the Social Cost of Carbon Pricing

Our results indicate that a tax on gasoline will disproportionately aﬀect the usage and, to a lesser
extent, scrappage of cars with greater emissions of local pollutants. To quantify this, we use our
data to simulate the change in emissions resulting from a $1 increase in the tax on gasoline, or

15

roughly a $110 per ton of CO2 tax.11 We account for both the intensive and extensive margins,
as well as all the dimensions of heterogeneity we have documented in Sections 5 and 6. For this
simulation, we assume that the tax was imposed in 1998, and use our empirical models to estimate
the level of gasoline consumption and emissions from 1998 until 2008, had gasoline prices been $1
greater. Appendix C provides details of the steps we take for the simulation.
Tables 17, 18, and 19 show the results of our simulation for each year from 1998-2008, and
the yearly average over the period. The two columns shows the total reduction in annual gasoline
consumption and CO2 emissions, in millions of gallons and millions of tons, respectively. The next
two columns value the deadweight loss from the reduction in gasoline consumption. We approximate
deadweight loss as

∆P ·∆Q
2

and adjust for inflation. The next section of the table presents the social

benefit resulting from the reduction in NOx , HC, and CO due to the tax. Finally, the last column
of the table shows the net cost of abating a ton of carbon dioxide, accounting for the reductions in
criteria pollution.
Table 17 shows the results of a simulation that does not account for heterogeneity across emissions profiles. The reduction in gasoline consumption declines slightly over time from around 800
million gallons in 1998 down to around 625 in 2008. The reduction in criteria pollutants declines
quickly as the fleet becomes cleaner. Nonetheless, the co-benefits of a gasoline tax are substantial,
averaging 74% of the deadweight loss over the ten year period.
Table 18 adds heterogeneity on the intensive margin, but not the extensive margins. The total
change in gasoline consumption is smaller, declining from 520 million gallons in 1998 to 208.5
million gallons in 2008. This is a result of more fuel eﬃcient vehicles having a higher average VMT.
However, the reductions in criteria pollutants are much larger. In 1998 the co-benefits are over
200% of the deadweight loss, with the net cost of abating a ton of carbon staying negative until
2004 and remaining low afterward. On average, we estimate that on average more than 130% of
the deadweight loss resulting from a gasoline tax would be compensated for by a decrease in local
air pollution between 1998 and 2008.
Finally, Table 19 adds heterogeneity on the extensive margins of scrappage and new car purchases. The net eﬀect of the extensive margin is an increase in criteria pollutants, due to the
decreased scrappage vehicles 10-15 years old, but an increase in greenhouse gas abatement. The
amount and value of the co-benefits is reduced compared to the figures in Table 18, but the dif11

We assume all of the tax is passed through to consumers. Our implicit assumption is that the supply elasticity
is infinite. This is likely a fair assumption in the long-run and for policies that reduce gasoline consumption in the
near-term.

16

ference is relatively small. Now on average nearly 120% of the deadweight loss is compensated for
by the co-benefits. The net cost of the tax remains negative through 2003. In the last year of our
sample, the net cost is below $24 per ton of CO2 .
Consistent with the way smog is formed, the majority the benefits come from reductions in
hydrocarbons. As discussed in the next section, most counties in California are “NOx -constrained”.
In simplest terms this means that local changes in NOx emissions do not reduce smog, but changes
in hydrocarbons do. In addition to the precursors to smog, we also find large co-benefits arising
from CO reductions.
We argue that these results should be viewed as strict lower bounds of the co-benefits for a
variety of reasons. First, we have ignored all other negative externalities associated with vehicles;
many of these, such as particulate matter, accidents, and congestion externalities, will be strongly
correlated with either VMT and the emissions of NOx , HCs, and CO. Second, because of the rules
of the Smog Check program many vehicles that emission standards are not required to be tested,
leading to their omission in this analysis. For these reasons, we view our estimates as strict lower
bounds. Third, a variety of behaviors associated with smog check programs would lead the on-road
emissions of vehicles to likely be higher than the tested levels. These include, but are not limited to,
fraud, tampering with emission-control technologies between tests, failure to repair emission-control
technologies until a test is required, etc.
When we account for the heterogeneity in the responses to changes in gasoline prices, we see that
the co-benefits from reduced air pollution would substantially ameliorate the costs of an increased
gasoline tax. The co-benefits would have been especially substantial in the late 1990s, but persist
in more recent years as well, even though the fleet has become cleaner. To put these numbers
into context, Greenstone, Kopits, and Wolverton (2011) estimate the social cost of carbon for a
variety of assumptions about the discount rate, relationship between emissions and temperatures,
and models of economic activity. For 2010, using a 3 percent discount rate, they find an average
SCC of $21.40, with a 95th percentile of $64.90. Using a 2.5 percent discount rate, the average
SCC is $35.10. Our results suggest that once the co-benefits are accounted for, a $1.00 gas tax (i.e.,
a $110 per ton of CO2 tax) would be nearly cost-eﬀective even at the lower of these three numbers
and well below the average social cost of capital using a 2.5 percent interest rate.12
The co-benefits vary considerably across counties. This variation comes from variation in the
marginal damages, variation in the elasticities, and variation in the heterogeneity across vehicle
12

Of course, a tax somewhere below this would likely maximize welfare.

types. Figures 9 through 11 illustrate the first two types of variation. Figures 9 and 10 map the
variation in the marginal damages for NOx and HC calculated by Muller and Mendelsohn (2009).
While marginal damages for HC are positively correlated with population (correlation coeﬃcient of
0.84), the marginal damage for NOx are negatively correlated with both HC (0.49) and population
(0.36). The reason for this has to do with the chemistry of ground-level ozone formation. Groundlevel ozone, or smog, is formed in the presence of NOx , HCs, heat, and sunlight. When the ratio of
NOx to HCs is not too large or small, the production function of smog, in the presence of sunlight
and heat, is similar to that of a Leontiﬀ production function. Therefore, a county can be in a
region of the level-set where increasing NOx does not increase smog production because there are
not enough HCs to mix with the additional NOx . This is known as NOx constrained. In contrast, a
county may have so much HCs such that increasing HC does not lead to more smog. This is known
as HC, or VOC, -constrained.13 Therefore, the marginal damages of NOx and HC are negatively
correlated.14 Given that vehicles emit roughly equal amounts of NOx and HCs, in some respects
the average (or total) of marginal damages across NOx and HCs is more telling.
Figure 11 maps the absolute value of the elasticity of VMT across counties, calculated by estimating equation 1 and allowing the elasticity to vary by county of Smog Check. The absolute value
of demand elasticities tend to be positively correlated with population, although the correlation
coeﬃcient is only 0.20.
This variation leads to the variation in the co-benefits in Figure 12. The distribution is slightly
skewed with a non-population weighted mean of $27.62 per ton of CO2 and median of $24.47; the
standard deviation is $24.46. More populated areas have greater co-benefits, on average. Figure 13
shows a scatterplot of the co-benefits across counties versus the log of the counties population.15
Los Angeles is clearly an outlier with benefits of $146.60 per ton of CO2 over our sample, although
as noted the median is nearly $25 with 75 percent of counties exceeding average co-benefits of over
$10.

Optimal Gasoline Tax in the Presence of Heterogeneity

Parry and Small (2005) derive a formula for the second-best optimal gasoline tax, with components
accounting for the various external costs of transportation. They do not account for the possibility
13

Of course, the chemistry is more complicated than this. In fact, the isoquants of the production process are
backward bending in the sense that if there is so much NOx , more NOx actually reduces smog (NO combines with
O3 (ozone) to form NO2 and O2 ). This is known as titration. See figure 14.

For California the correlation is -0.36.

of heterogeneity in the response of VMT to gasoline prices, and use only one value for the damage
per mile associated with pollution as a result. We extend this work by incorporating heterogeneity
on the intensive margin of driving, and examine how this aﬀects the calculated optimal gasoline
tax.
Let t∗f be the optimal (ad-valorem) tax on gasoline. Parry and Small derive that:

M

F

E PF is the marginal damage of carbon emissions, and E C , E A , and E PM are the marginal damage
of congestion, accidents and local pollution, respectively, denominated in cents per gallon. We focus
on M ECF and maintain Parry and Small’s assumptions for the other components. For derivation
and definition of other terms, see Parry and Small (2005).
Parry and Small use a range of values for each parameter in their model; we use their “central
values” in all cases, with only two exceptions: We use our own estimates for ηM F , and calculate a
value for E PM based on average emissions rates of NOx , HC, and CO in the Smog Check data. NOx
and HC are valued as in Muller and Mendelsohn (2009), using a population weighted average of the
marginal damages for each county in California. CO is valued using the median value in Matthews
and Lave (2000). We utilize the regression with heterogeneity over MPG, HC, NOx , CO, weight,
and age described in Section 7.1. To calculate the optimal gasoline tax without heterogeneity, we
use the average elasticity of:
β̄ =

where q denotes a quartile/age group, and sq the share of group q in the Smog Check data. With

such that the local pollution component is a weighted average damage rates times elasticities. We
calculate average elasticity and emissions rates using the portion of the California fleet appearing
19

in the 1998 and 2008 Smog Check data. All values are adjusted for inflation to year 2000 dollars.
Parry and Small calculate a second-best optimal gasoline tax rate of $1.01 for the United
States. Based on our average elasticity estimate and the average emissions rates in the Smog
Check program, the optimal gasoline tax for California was $0.92 in 1998 and $0.85 in 2008. Once
heterogeneity in the response to gasoline prices is taken into account, the optimal tax rises to $1.05
in 1998, and $0.90 in 2008. While these are modest increases, this is because a large portion of the
optimal tax comes from the Pigouvian tax components for accidents and congestion. If we focus on
that portion coming from local pollution, it increases from $0.22 to $0.33 in 1998 and from $0.08
to $0.13 in 2008, a change of 52 and 57 percent, respectively.

California versus the rest of the US

Given that our empirical setting is California, it is natural to ask whether our results are representative of the country as a whole. At the broadest level, the co-benefits from carbon pricing
are a function of the per capita number of miles driven, the emission characteristics of the fleet of
vehicles, and the marginal damages of the emissions. We present evidence that the benefits may,
in fact, be larger outside of California. The reason for this is that while the marginal damages
are indeed larger in California, the vehicle stock in California is much cleaner than the rest of the
country because California has traditionally lead the rest of the US in terms of vehicle emission
standards.
The results in Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) provide a convenient way to test whether California
diﬀers in terms of marginal damages. Table 20 presents points on the distribution of marginal
damages for NOx , HCs, and the sum of the two, weighted by each county’s annual VMT.16 Figure
15 plots the kernel density estimates of the distributions. We present the sum of because counties
are typically either “NOx constrained” or “VOC (HC) constrained” and the sum is perhaps more
informative. As expected, the marginal damages are higher in California for HCs, but lower for
NOx , as California counties tend to be VOC-constrained. The sum of the two marginal damages
is 78 percent higher in California. Higher points in the distribution show an even larger disparity.
This eﬀect is oﬀset, however, by the cleaner vehicle stock within California—a result of California’s stricter emission standards. To illustrate this, we collected county-level average per-mile
emission rates for NOx , HCs, and CO from the EPA Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES).
This reports total emissions from transportation and annual mileage for each county. Table 20 also
16

All of the points on the distribution and densities discussed in this section weight each county by its total VMT.

20

presents points on the per-mile emissions and Figure 16 plots the distributions.17 Mean countylevel NOx , HCs, and CO are 67, 36, and 31 percent lower in California, respectively. Other points
in the distributions exhibit similar patterns.
Finally, we calculate the county-level average per-mile externality for each pollutant, as well
as the sum of the three. Table 20 and Figure 17 illustrates these. As expected the HC damages
are higher, but the average county-level per-mile externality from the sum the three pollutants is
30 percent lower in California compared to the rest of the country; the 25th percentile, median,
and 75th percentile are 35, 30, and 9 percent lower, respectively. These calculations suggest that,
provided the average VMT elasticities are not significantly smaller outside of California and/or the
heterogeneity across vehicle types is not significantly diﬀerent (in the reverse way), our estimates
are likely to apply to the rest of the country.

Conclusions

This paper estimates how the sensitivity to gas prices varies by the emission rates and weight of
vehicles. We find that those vehicles that have higher externalities are more price responsive. We
show that this significantly increases the co-benefits associated with carbon taxes, as well as the
optimal gas tax when gas taxes are used as a second-best policy tool in the presence of multiple
market failures.
These results should be viewed in light of the fact that existing policies used to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions from transportation—CAFE standards, ethanol subsidies, and the RFS—fail to take
advantage of these co-benefits, and can even increase criteria pollutant emissions, because they
reduce the marginal cost of an extra mile travelled. Given that previous work that has analyzed
the relative eﬃciency of these policies to gasoline or carbon taxes has ignored the heterogeneity
that we document, such policies are less eﬃcient than previous thought.

17

We note that these are higher than the averages in our data. This may reflect the fact that smog checks are
not required for vehicles with model years before 1975 and these vehicles likely have very high emissions since this
pre-dates many of the emission standards within the US.

Steps to clean smog check data

A.1

Smog Check Data

Our data from the Smog Check Program are essentially the universe of test records from January
1, 1996 to December 31, 2010. We were only able to obtain test records going back to 1996 because
this was the year when the Smog Check program introduced its electronic transmission system.
Because the system seems to have been phased in during the first half of 1996, and major program
changes took eﬀect in 1998 we limit our sample to test records from January 1998 on. For our
analyses, we use a 10% sample of VINs, selecting by the second to last digit of the VIN. We exclude
tests which have no odometer reading, with a test result of ”Tampered” or ”Aborted” and vehicles
which have more than 36 tests in the span of the data. Vehicles often have multiple Smog Check
records in a year, whether due to changes of ownership or failed tests, but we argue that more than
36 in what is at most a 12 year-span indicates some problem with the data.18
A few adjustments must be made to accurately estimate VMT and emissions per mile.
First, we adjust odometer readings for roll-overs and typos. Many of the vehicles in our analysis
were manufacturer withe 5-digit odometers–that is, five places for whole numbers plus a decimal.
As such, any time one of these vehicles crosses over 100,000 miles, the odometer “rolls over” back
to 0. To complicate matters further, sometimes either the vehicle owner or Smog Check technician
notices this problem and records the appropriate number in the 100,000s place, and sometimes they
do not. To address this problem, we employ an algorithm that increases the hundred thousands
place in the odometer reading whenever a rollover seems to have occurred. The hundred thousands
are incremented if the previous test record shows higher mileage, or if the next test record is shows
more than 100,000 additional miles on the odometer (indicating that the odometer had already
rolled over, but the next check took this into account). The algorithm also attempts to correct for
typos and entry errors. An odometer reading is flagged if it does not fit with surrounding readings
for the same vehicle–either it is less than the previous reading or greater the next–and cannot be
explained by a rollover. The algorithm then tests whether fixing one of several common typos will
make the flagged readings fit (e.g. moving the decimal over one place). If no correction will fit, the
reading is replaced with the average of the surrounding readings. Finally, if after all our corrections
any vehicle has an odometer reading above 800,000 or has implied VMT per day greater than 200 or
18

For instance, there is one vehicle in particular, a 1986 Volvo station wagon, which has records for more than 600
Smog Checks between January 1996 and March 1998. The vehicle likely belonged to a Smog Check technician who
used it to test the electronic transmission system.

less than zero, we exclude the vehicle from our analysis. All of our VMT analyses use this adjusted
mileage.
Emissions results from smog checks are given in either parts per million (for HC and NOx) or
percent (O2 , CO, and CO2 ). Without knowing the volume of air involved, there is no straightforward way to convert this to total emissions. Fortunately, as part of an independent evaluation
of the Smog Check program conducted in 2002-2003, Sierra Research Inc. and Eastern Research
Group estimated a set of conversion equations to convert the proportional measurements of the
ASM test to emissions in grams per mile travelled. These equations are reported in Morrow and
Runkle (2005) and are reproduced below. The equations are for HCs, NOx and CO, and estimate
grams per mile for each pollutant as a non-linear function of all three pollutants, model year and
vehicle weight. The equations for vehicles of up to model year 1990 are

Steps to clean DMV data

We deal with two issues associated with the DMV data. The main issue with the DMV data is
that, often, entries for the same addresses will have slightly diﬀerent formats. For example, 12 East
Hickory Street may show up as 12 East Hickory St, 12 E. Hickory St., etc. To homogenize the
entries, we input each of the DMV entries into mapquest.com and then replace the entry with the
address that mapquest.com gives.
Second, the apartment number is often missing in the DMV data. This has the eﬀect of
yielding a large number of vehicles in the same “location”. We omit observations that have over
seven vehicles in a given address or more than three last names of registered owners.

Details of the gas tax policy simulation

For the intensive margin, we estimate a regression as in column 6 of Tables 3 to 7, except that we
interact ln(DPM) with quartile of fuel economy, vehicle weight, and emissions of HC, NOx , and
CO, and dummies for vehicle age bins, again using bins of 4-9, 10-15, and 16-29 years, and control
for the direct eﬀects of quartiles of HC, NOx , and CO emissions. As in Tables 8 to 12, we use
quartiles calculated by year and age bin. The coeﬃcients are diﬃcult to interpret on their own,
and too numerous to list. However, most are statistically diﬀerent from zero, and the exceptions
are due to small point estimates, not large standard errors.
As in Section 6, we compress our dataset to have at most one observation per vehicle per year.
Each vehicle is then assigned an elasticity based on their quartiles and age bin. Vehicle i’s VMT
in the counterfactual with an additional $1 tax on gasoline is calculated by:

V

is vehicle i’s actual average VMT per day between their current and previous
where V M TBAU

Smog Check, Pi is the average gasoline price over that time, and βi is the elasticity for the fuel
economy/weight/HC/NO/CO/age cell that i belongs to.
For the extensive margin, we estimate a Cox regression on the hazard of scrappage for vehicles
10 years and older, stratifying by VIN prefix and interacting DPM with all five type of quartiles
and age bins 10-15 and 16-29. Similar to the intensive margin, we assign each vehicle a hazard
coeﬃcient based on their quartile-age cell. Cox coeﬃcients can be transformed into hazard ratios,
but to simulate the aﬀect of an increase in gasoline prices on the composition of the vehicle fleet,
we must convert these into changes in total hazard.
To do this, we first calculate the actual empirical hazard rate for prefix k in year t as:

OrigHazardkt =

Dkt
,
Rkt

where Dkt is the number of vehicles in group k which are scrapped in year t, and Rkt is the number
of vehicle at risk (that is, which have not previously been scrapped or censored). We then use
the coeﬃcients from our Cox regression to calculate the counterfactual hazard faced by vehicles of
prefix k in quartile-age group q during year t as:19
19

Note that age group is determined by model-year and year.

26

N ewHazardqkt = OrigHazardkt ∗ exp

�

�
1
· γq ,
M P Gk

where M P Gk is the average fuel economy of vehicle of prefix k and γq is the Cox coeﬃcient
associated with quartile group q. We then use the change in hazard to construct a weight Hqkt
indicating the probability that a vehicle of prefix k in quartile group q in year t would be in the
fleet if a $1 gasoline tax were imposed. Weights greater than 1 are possible, in which should be
interpreted as a Hqkt −1 probability that another vehicle of the same type would be on the road, but
which was scrapped under “Business as Usual.” Since the hazard is the probability of scrappage
in year t, conditional on survival to year t, this weight must be calculated interatively, taking into
account the weight the previous year. Specifically, we have:
Hqkt =

t
�

j=1998

(1 − (N ewHazardqkj − OrigHazardkt )).

We also assign each vehicle in each year a population weight. This is done both to scale our
estimates up to the size of the full California fleet of personal vehicles, and to account for the ways
in which the age composition of the Smog Check data diﬀers from that of the fleet. We construct
these weights using the vehicle population estimates contained in CARB’s EMFAC07 software,
which are given by year, vehicle age, and truck status. Our population weight is the number of
vehicles of a given age and truck status in a each year given by EMFAC07, divided by the number
of such vehicle appearing in our sample. For instance, if EMFAC07 gave the number of 10 year old
trucks in 2005 as 500, while our data contained 50, each 10 year old truck in our data would have
a population weight of 10. Denote the population weight by Ptac , where t is year, a is age, and c
is truck status.
There is an additional extensive margin which we have not estimated in this paper, that of
new car purchases. To ensure that the total vehicle population is accurate, we apply an ad hoc
correction based on Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2009), who find that a $1 increase in gas
prices would decrease new car sales by 650,000 per year. Since California’s vehicle fleet makes up
about 13% of the national total, we decrease the population of model years 1998 and later by 84500
when constructing the population weight for the counterfactual. We apply 40% of the decrease to
trucks, and 60% to passenger cars. Denote the “new car eﬀect” nc .
We estimate the total annual emissions by passenger vehicle in California of NOx , HC, CO,
and CO2 as actually occurred, and under a counterfactual where a $1 gasoline tax was imposed in

27

1998. Let i denote a vehicle, a vehicle age, c truck status, then the annual emissions of pollutant
p in year t under “business as usual” are:
Emissionpt
BAU =

�
i

i
Ptac ∗ V M TBAU
∗ ri (p) ∗ 365,

and under the counterfactual they are:
Emissionpt
counterf actual =

�
i

i
(Ptac −1(model year >= 1998)∗nc )∗Hqkt ∗V M Tcounterf
actual ∗ri (p)∗365,

where ri (p) is the emissions rate per mile of pollutant p for vehicle i. For NOx , HC, and CO, this
is the last Smog Check reading in grams per mile, while for CO2 this is the vehicle’s gallons per
mile multiplied by 19.2 pounds per gallon.
