Comparison Friction: Experimental Evidence from Medicare Drug Plans

NBER Working Paper No. 17410

JEL No. D89,I11
ABSTRACT
Consumers need information to compare alternatives for markets to function efficiently. Recognizing
this, public policies often pair competition with easy access to comparative information. The implicit
assumption is that comparison friction—the wedge between the availability of comparative information
and consumers’ use of it—is inconsequential because information is readily available and consumers
will access this information and make effective choices. We examine the extent of comparison friction
in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United States. In a randomized field
experiment, an intervention group received a letter with personalized cost information. That information
was readily available for free and widely advertised. However, this additional step—providing the
information rather than having consumers actively access it—had an impact. Plan switching was 28
percent in the intervention group, versus 17 percent in the comparison group, and the intervention
caused an average decline in predicted consumer cost of about $100 per year among letter recipients—roughly
5 percent of the cost in the comparison group. Our results suggest that comparison friction can be large
even when the cost of acquiring information is small, and may be relevant for a wide range of public
policies that incorporate consumer choice.

I. INTRODUCTION
Government services increasingly rely on consumer choice. For instance, the design of the
largest new social program of the last decade, Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance, relies
heavily on consumers making choices. Choice is a key feature of Social Security privatizations
and proposed school voucher programs. The rationale for including choice and competition is
straightforward. Individuals have heterogeneous preferences and choice allows them to opt for
services that best match their preferences. Competition between providers then facilitates a menu
of services being provided at the cost-efficient frontier. In the best case, consumers get services
that fit their needs better and governments save money.
This best case requires that consumers be able to look at the menu of options and pick the
one that most cost effectively matches their needs. Making such choices requires having
informed consumers. Yet, service providers may not provide all relevant information voluntarily.
When service providers have information relevant to choices that consumers do not, this
information asymmetry can undercut the benefits of choice and competition. As a result,
policymakers frequently pair choice mechanisms with transparency systems—such as public
school report cards, nutritional labeling, toxic pollution reporting, auto safety and fuel economy
ratings, and corporate financial reporting (Weil et al. 2006)—all intended to make comparative
information readily available.
Simply making information available, however, does not ensure consumers will use it. We
call comparison friction the wedge between the availability of comparative information and
consumers’ use of it. (It is analogous to search friction—the challenge for buyers and sellers in
locating each other.) Traditionally, public policies assume that comparison friction is largely

1

inconsequential as long as comparative data is provided for free and the benefits from comparing
are non-negligible.
This study estimates the effect of reducing comparison friction in the market for prescription
drug insurance plans for senior citizens. Over a period of about two and a half years, we
followed the choices made by seniors who participated in an experiment we designed that
reduced comparison friction by delivering personalized cost information to seniors via a letter.
That personalized information used aspects of the match between consumers and the available
plans (specifically, the differences in out-of-pocket costs of the drugs an individual takes) that
could be readily observed.
One group of seniors—the intervention group—was presented with personalized price
information created by entering their drug data into Medicare’s Plan Finder website. They saw
the cost of all plans for their personal drug profile as well as how much they would save by
switching to the lowest-cost plan. A comparison group was given only the address of this
website. The distinction between the groups was that the comparison group had to actively visit a
website (or call Medicare’s toll-free number, or seek information from a third party), whereas the
intervention group had information delivered to them. We concentrate specifically on people
who enrolled in a plan, and examine the effects of comparison friction on the choice of plan
during an open enrollment period at the end of a year and on the plan selected for the coming
year.
The intervention was designed to reduce comparison friction related to expected cost of
plans. Other forms of comparison friction related to differences in uncertainty about costs or
about requirements insurers might have for obtaining medication were not addressed. The

2

transaction costs of taking action and deciding to switch plans (involving a phone call) were
relatively low.
We found large effects of this simple intervention. The intervention group switched plans 28
percent of the time, whereas the comparison group only did so 17 percent of the time. The
average cost savings of the intervention—across the entire intervention group including nonswitchers—was about $100 per year, or about 5 percent of the average predicted cost for the
comparison group. We did not find effects on potential variability of consumer costs or on plan
quality, although our power to do so was limited. The effects on consumer cost appeared to
persist over time, although those estimates are imprecise. The intervention encouraged some
individuals to switch to the lowest-cost plan and some to switch to other lower-cost plans.
Although our sample included a larger proportion of college graduates and of people dissatisfied
with their plans than a nationally representative sample would have, estimates of the effects for
non-college graduates and for people satisfied with their plans ($129 and $74, respectively) were
substantial. We estimate that our sample had larger potential savings in dollars—and similar
savings in percentage terms—from switching to the lowest-cost plan than a national sample
would have. The effects of the intervention for individuals below and above $400 in potential
savings were similar in relative terms (0.052 and 0.075 log points, respectively). Overall, the
effects in these subgroups suggest that the results have broader applicability in a range of settings
beyond that of the experiment itself.
These results fit into a set of recent studies that focus on comparison friction, such as those
that examine the effect of the Internet in reducing comparison friction in markets where
government plays a relatively minor role. (For example, see Brynjolfsson and Smith, 2000; Scott
Morton, Zettelmeyer and Silva-Risso, 2001; Brown and Goolsbee, 2002; and Ellison and Ellison,

3

2009.) Hastings and Weinstein (2008), in a study of school choice where government plays a
major role, found parents were more likely to choose a school with higher average test scores
after receiving difficult to gather publicly available information about school scores. Moreover,
children improved their own test scores after attending a higher-scoring school. A key difference
between that study and ours is that the information provided in that study was plausibly hard to
gather. In our context, the comparative data was relatively easy to acquire. Our results as a
whole suggest that comparison friction could be effectively large even when the cost of acquiring
information is low. This is consistent with other findings in contexts ranging from finance to
nutrition to health where people have often failed to make use of comparative information that is
readily available (Fung, Graham, and Weil, 2007). The findings have implications for a wide
range of public policies that incorporate consumer choice.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides a very brief background on
Medicare Part D. Section III presents a conceptual framework for our analysis of plan choices.
Section IV describes our data sources. Section V uses several of these sources (a cross-sectional
survey and several audits of information sources) to characterize demand for and supply of
information and knowledge of Medicare drug plans, and provide context for the experimental
analyses. Section VI describes the experiment and presents results. Section VII discusses their
interpretation. Section VIII discusses directions for future research.

II. MEDICARE PART D
The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit was established as part of the Medicare
Modernization Act of 2003, with coverage first beginning in January 2006. The drug benefit was
subsidized, with Medicare paying about three-quarters of the premium. At the outset and again at

4

the end of each year during an open enrollment period, individuals typically chose from among
40-60 plans, depending upon where they lived.
Costs of plans included a monthly premium common to all beneficiaries of that plan and a
personalized component that depended upon use. Under a standard plan for 2007 for drugs on the
plan’s formulary of covered medications, individuals paid 100% of the first $265 of total costs
(determined by the quantity of prescriptions and their full prices negotiated by the plan), 25% of
total costs $266-$2400, 100% of total costs above $2400 until own out of pocket costs reached
$3850. Above the $3850 threshold, individuals paid either $2.15 for a 30 day supply of generics
and $5.35 for brand name drugs, or 5% of further total costs– whichever was greater.
Most insurers offered two or three plans, including one actuarially equivalent to the standard
plan and one or two with higher premiums and more cost sharing. Some plans had cost-sharing
over the initial range (that is, no deductible) and some had cost sharing over the middle range
(that is, offered some coverage through the coverage gap known as the “doughnut hole”). Still
other variants had cost sharing in the form of a fixed price per prescription (co-payments with
amounts depending upon the specific tier into which the plan had classified a drug) rather than as
a percentage of the cost.1 Actuarially equivalent plans (61 percent of enrollees in standalone
plans nationally in 2006) used one or more of these variants as an alternative benefit design that
covered the same share of enrollees’ drug costs, on average, as the standard benefit (18 percent
1

For example, Humana Insurance Company offered three standalone prescription drug plans (PDPs) in 2007.
Humana PDP Standard had a premium that differed by state, ranging from $10.20 to $18.20 per month, and used
exactly the same cost sharing as the standard plan described above. Humana PDP Enhanced had a premium ranging
from $17.10 to $27.50 per month. There was no deductible, and the costs were: $5 for a 30 day supply of preferred
generic drugs; $30 for a 30 day supply of preferred brand drugs; $60 for a 30 day supply of other non-preferred
drugs; 25% coinsurance for a 30 day supply of specialty drugs; $15 for a 90 day retail supply of preferred generic
drugs ($12.50 mail order); $90 for a 90 day retail supply of preferred brand drugs ($75 mail order); $180 for a 90
day supply of other non-preferred drugs ($150 mail order). After the total yearly drug costs (paid by the individual
and the plan) reached $2,400, the individual paid 100% of costs until own out of pocket costs reached $3850, at
which point there was the same catastrophic coverage cost sharing as with the standard plan. Humana Complete had
a monthly premium ranging from $69.50 to $88.40 per month, and differed from the Enhanced plan only in that it
provided cost sharing in the coverage gap: $5 for a 30 day supply of preferred generic drugs, and $15 for a 90 day
supply of preferred generic drugs.

of enrollees). Enhanced plans (20 percent of enrollees) covered a greater share of the drug costs,
often using some cost sharing in the doughnut hole.
Insurers had different coverage of drugs and dosage forms (known as the formulary), which
sometimes differed among plans offered by insurers. The insurers differed along a variety of
other dimensions (that generally did not vary among plans offered by insurers), such as
utilization management tools (prior authorization, step therapy, quantity limitations), pharmacy
accessibility, mail order discounts, customer service, and financial stability of insurer.2
Medicare beneficiaries were offered the opportunity to voluntarily enroll in drug coverage
either through a standalone plan (complementing fee-for-service health insurance through
Medicare) or through a Medicare Advantage plan (often a health maintenance organization).
This study focuses on individuals who were enrolled in standalone prescription drug plans in
2006 (the first year the benefit was offered) and were not receiving low-income subsidies.
Nationally, this group was about 8 million of 43 million seniors (MedPAC 2007).
During an open enrollment period from November 15 to December 31 in 2006 (and similarly
in subsequent years), individuals could switch plans. Prior to this period, individuals received a
Medicare and You handbook, which contained fourteen pages describing Part D plans and
answering frequently asked questions. The handbook indicated that one could switch plans by
calling the plan that one wanted to join, or by calling 800-MEDICARE. The handbook included
one page with a list of plans offered in one’s state, with information on the monthly premium,
benefit type (basic, enhanced without gap, enhanced with gap), and the percentage of the 100
most common drugs that are covered by the plan.

2

For example, all three Humana plans in 2007 used the same pharmacy network and mail order system, and covered
the same drugs using the same formulary with the same utilization management.
6

There are several reasons to suspect substantial comparison friction in Part D plan selection.
For example, Heiss, McFadden, and Winter (2006) found that about 70 percent of seniors agreed
with the statement “There were too many alternative plans to choose from” and more than half
had difficulty understanding how Medicare Part D worked and what savings to expect. Earlier
research has found that seniors have difficulty navigating insurance choices within Medicare
(Gold, Achman, and Brown 2003; Hibbard et al. 2001; McCormack et al. 2001).
Recently, a number of authors have examined the quality of seniors’ choices and the effect of
information in the context of Medicare Part D. Heiss, McFadden, and Winter (2010) used survey
data and concluded that seniors’ decision to enroll in 2006 responded to incentives provided by
their health status and the environment but acknowledged that “enrollment is transparently
optimal for most eligible seniors.”
Abaluck and Gruber (2011) examined claims data from 2005 and 2006 and determined that
most seniors did not choose plans on an efficient frontier, defined in terms of expected cost and
its variance. In addition, relative to a rational model of choice, seniors placed more weight on
plan premiums than on out-of-pocket costs, placed weight on plan’s financial characteristics (e.g.
the presence of a deductible) independent of the effect of those characteristics on their own costs,
and showed unexpectedly low levels of risk aversion—all behaviors that contradict a rational,
normative model of plan choice.
Based on an analysis of two years of panel data, Ketcham et al.(2010) found that seniors
reduced their out-of-pocket costs for insurance and prescription drugs above the cost of their
cheapest ex-post alternative between 2006 and 2007, although this improvement came both from
active decisions to change plans and convergence among plans. Using a laboratory experiment,
Bundorf and Szrek (2010) reported that both the benefits and costs of choice increase with the

7

number of options available. In another laboratory experiment, Hanoch et al. (2009) found that
participants were less likely to correctly identify the plan that minimized total cost when
presented with larger numbers of plans. Taken together, these results suggest some potential for
choice errors, particularly for more difficult choices, in newer situations, and for less able
individuals; they also suggest some potential for learning and adapting and a role for
information.3

III. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
To visualize the choice problem facing the individual, we focus on three decisions. We
define the following random variables representing the distribution of potential realizations for
each individual:


is the potential benefit to the individual i from plan j minus switching costs;



is the component of potential consumer cost for plan j that can be predicted from
comparative research (based on extrapolations of last year’s drug use); and



̃ is the component of potential consumer cost for plan j that cannot be predicted from
comparative research.

We assume a utility function for increments to the utility from current consumption from

participating in a plan, such that

is the comparison friction—specifically, each individual’s known cost of

undertaking comparative research about the costs of plans (expressed in the same units as
3

).

Other research on Part D has examined the market structure and plan dimensions, such as the incentives that exist
for adverse selection (Goldman, Joyce, and Vogt, 2011), prices for branded drugs (Duggan and Scott Morton, 2011),
and welfare impacts of limiting the number of Part D plans (Lucarelli, Prince, and Simon, 2008). The cost
management strategies do appear to have encouraged people to switch to cheaper medications (Neuman et al. 2007).
Utilization has increased, while seniors’ expenditures have decreased (Yin et al. 2008). About one-third of new
public expenditure has crowded out previous private expenditure (Engelhardt and Gruber, forthcoming).

The decision to undertake research involves comparing

to the expected value of

the predictable cost component is uncertain (because research has not yet been undertaken). This

The individual undertakes research if the expected value of the maximum expected utility from

captures the option value of comparative research. That is, if the

9

research could reveal substantial predicted savings from a plan, then paying a small cost of
research tends to be worthwhile.4
III.D. Implications
Because research reduces uncertainty about costs, we would expect plan choices based on
research to be more sensitive to cost differences than those made without research. Thus, we
would expect an intervention that reduced the cost of comparative research to cause individuals
to put more weight on cost (as a random variable with lower variance in their expected utility
calculation) when evaluating plans—which would tend to reduce potential consumer cost of
selected plans.
When

is reduced for some individuals, we would expect more people to undertake research

and switching plans would be worthwhile for more people. However, the magnitude of the effect
of the intervention on potential consumer cost is not necessarily determined by the magnitude of
because the cost savings must be sufficient to compensate for switching costs.

IV. DATA SOURCES
Several sources of data were used for this paper. A national phone survey of Part D
beneficiaries was fielded to understand their knowledge of and experience with Medicare drug
plans and their sources of information. An audit of potential sources of information was
undertaken to understand the information available to them. A sample of pharmacy claims data
was obtained to examine the potential savings available to beneficiaries who could change plans.
4

For example, assume there are only two plans—one is the current plan and a second is an alternative. Without
research, assume the alternative has an equal chance of having large predicted savings on average (yielding X) or
large predicted cost on average (yielding -Y) such that its expected utility (0.5X - 0.5Y) is negative. Under these
conditions, the alternative will not be selected over the current plan. However, it will be worthwhile to do research
that will reveal whether the plan will result in utility of X or -Y if the combination of utility from predicted savings
X and the zero utility change from staying with the current plan is greater than the cost of the research—that is,
) when (0.5X + 0.5*0 – r ≥ 0).
(
10

And a field experiment was conducted in which some beneficiaries received a personalized letter
about drug plan choice, while others received general information.
IV.A. National Phone Survey
We commissioned a phone survey of Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 who were enrolled
in stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans. The survey was fielded in February and March
2007. A market research firm generated an initial sample of phone numbers; these numbers were
intended to reach seniors with high probability and, ultimately, to generate a nationally
representative sample of seniors. 26 percent of people reached by phone agreed to begin the
survey. Of these, 49 percent did not meet screening criteria, 8 percent did not complete the
survey, and 43 percent were both eligible and completed the survey. An additional 13 percent of
respondents were removed from the sample due to incomplete data, leading to 348 responses.
IV.B. Audit of Information Sources
Actors, hired by the researchers, made 12 calls to Medicare, 5 calls to State Health Insurance
Programs (SHIPs), 88 in-person visits to Boston area pharmacies (stratified by
chain/independent/retail, urban/suburban, and community income), 8 in-person visits to Bostonarea senior centers, and 12 calls to other help-lines, identified via an internet search, during the
open enrollment period in December 2006. For the in-person audits, an actor, aged
approximately 65, posed as a Medicare beneficiary and asked for advice about choosing a drug
plan using a set of questions developed by the research team. For the phone audit, a research
assistant, posing as a relative of a Medicare beneficiary, asked these same questions.

11

IV.C. Sample of Pharmacy Claims
We derived drug profiles for 59 seniors with Medicare drug plans from the 2006 claims of a
large pharmacy chain’s stores in one state. For 41 of these seniors, we identified a sponsor but
not a plan. For these individuals, we calculated costs for the lowest- and the highest-cost plan
among those offered by the sponsor. Cost measures were then created using the Medicare Plan
Finder website to compare costs of selected plans and the lowest-cost plans. The pharmacy data
is likely missing some data on prescriptions that the individual filled at other pharmacies; a
countervailing factor is that some individuals with insurance but without prescription use are
omitted from the sample by construction.
IV.D. Experimental Intervention
The experiment and associated data collection consisted of three surveys and one mailing. A
baseline phone survey was conducted in November 2006. A letter intervention was mailed in
December 2006. Two follow-up phone surveys were fielded: one in April and May of 2007 and
one in March and April of 2008.
Patients of the University of Wisconsin Hospital system age 65 and over made up the
sample frame. Letters of invitation were mailed to 5,873 subjects who were then contacted by
phone. Approximately half of those agreed to join the study. Of these, approximately 15 percent
met screening criteria, and reported a plan name that could be later matched to the Medicare Plan
Finder, leading to a baseline sample size of 451.
In the baseline survey, the participants answered detailed questions about their prescription
drug use and basic questions about personal characteristics. Researchers constructed measures of
beneficiary costs in each respondent’s current drug plan and in all available drug plans by
entering the respondent’s drug utilization information into the Medicare Plan Finder website.
12

After baseline data were collected, participants were randomly assigned to intervention and
comparison groups. Each participant received a personalized mailing. The materials participants
received are shown in the Appendix.
The 2007 follow-up inquired about the plan chosen for 2007 and the choice process. 406
people completed the baseline survey, were randomly assigned in the experiment, and completed
the 2007 follow-up survey—forming our main analytic sample—and 45 people completed the
baseline survey and were assigned to the experiment but could not be reached for follow-up.
Thus, although about half of those sent a letter of invitation did not agree to participate (which is
relevant for external validity), the study does include 90 percent of people randomly assigned to
a group in the experiment (which is particularly relevant for internal validity of the results from
the experiment). 92 percent of intervention group and 88 percent of comparison group completed
the 2007 follow-up survey.
The 2008 follow-up collected data on drugs used in 2007 and 2008, experiences in the 2007
plan, and the plan chosen for 2008.5 305 of those 406 people completing the 2007 follow-up
survey also completed the 2008 follow-up survey.
Data on actual plan enrollment in 2007 (from the 2007 follow-up survey) and 2008 (from
the 2008 follow-up survey) was used to determine when individuals had switched plans. To
assess the dispersion in costs across plans for the same individuals, we compiled data on the
predicted and actual costs of every possible plan. Predicted cost for 2007 is the estimated annual
cost measure computed by the Medicare Plan Finder for a given drug plan based on an
individual’s prescription drug use as reported at the time of random assignment in fall 2006. The

5

In order to construct cost measures, because the 2007 Medicare Plan Finder was no longer available in 2008,
researchers entered respondents’ reported 2007 drug utilization into a 2007 version of a private-sector counterpart of
the Medicare Plan Finder, the Experion Plan Prescriber. The Plan Finder was used to construct cost measures for
2008, and tests based on the 2008 releases of both tools demonstrated a high-level of agreement (>90 percent).
13

Plan Finder computed the out-of-pocket cost for each plan, assuming that the drugs entered
would be taken for the full year of 2007 and that chemically-equivalent generic drugs would be
substituted for brand-name drugs. Actual realized cost for 2007 is the estimated annual cost
measure computed by the Medicare Plan Finder for a given drug plan based on an individual’s
prescription drug use throughout 2007 (with dosages prorated to reflect that cumulative use) as
reported at the time of the second follow-up survey in 2008. Predicted cost for 2008 and for 2009
is based on current drug use as reported in the 2008 follow-up survey.

V. CHOICE ENVIRONMENT
We used our phone survey to assess the context within which seniors made choices about
whether or not to change prescription drug plans during open enrollment. A significant majority
of respondents knew that different plans were better for different people (82 percent) and that
they could only change plans during open enrollment (74 percent). (See Table I.) However, few
had learned additional facts about the specific differences among plans. Only 37 percent knew
that only some (rather than all) plans have a deductible. Only 55 percent knew that different
plans have different co-payments for generic drugs, rather than all plans having the same copayments.6
We found that over 80 percent of respondents were generally satisfied with their 2006
prescription drug plans. The percentage that switched plans between 2006 and 2007 was 10
percent, slightly above the reported national rate of seven percent.7 An additional 14 percent
considered switching for 2007 but did not switch, which is consistent with the high levels of

6

In survey data collected in 2005, just prior to the beginning of the first open enrollment period, Winter et al. (2006)
also found low knowledge about the structure of the benefit and the potential for differences among plans.

That national rate is for those not receiving the Low Income Subsidy (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2007).
14

reported satisfaction.8
The leading sources of information that participants used to learn about drug plans were
mailings from plans and mailings from Medicare. That material is not personalized and does not
convey transparent information about out-of-pocket costs. The more interactive forms of
information gathering, such as in-person, phone, or internet, were each used by less than 15
percent of respondents. Eighteen percent reviewed personalized plan comparisons.9
To better understand the information available in the existing choice environment and the
costs of acquiring it, we audited five potential sources of advice on choosing a drug plan: the
Medicare help-line (1-800-Medicare), state health insurance assistance programs (SHIPs), senior
centers, other telephone help-lines, and retail pharmacies. In our calls to 1-800-Medicare,
customer service representatives consistently entered personalized drug information, identified a
low cost plan, and offered to enroll the caller—drawing upon Medicare’s website tool, the
Prescription Drug Plan Finder. Our calls to SHIPs generated either referrals to Medicare or offers
of similar assistance. Our visits to senior centers sometimes resulted in general discussions about
the drug benefit or partial demonstrations of the Medicare website but never in comparative
information left in the hands of the auditor. A search for and audit of other sources of telephone
advice indicated that few private-sector information sources had emerged.10 In general, these
sources were either not helpful or referred the caller to Medicare or another public-sector

8

Our survey results are similar to Heiss, McFadden, and Winter (2010), who reported that 82 percent rated their
2006 plan good or better, 18 percent considered switching for 2007 but did not, and 11 percent switched plans from
2006 to 2007. Unpublished results from the same survey used in that research indicated that 60 percent did not
consider switching because they were happy with their plan while 18 percent “wanted to avoid the trouble of going
through the plan comparison and choice process again.”

Our results are broadly consistent with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2007), which reported
results from a survey in January 2007 indicating that 85 percent of seniors were aware of the open enrollment
period, 50 percent reviewed their current coverage, 34 percent compared plans, and 17 percent evaluated premiums,
co-payments, and coverage.

A contributing factor may be Medicare policies, motivated by concerns about conflicts of interest that restrict the
extent to which third parties can provide advice.

information source. In one noteworthy exception (a major pharmacy chain), the help-line offered
personalized suggestions, using technology similar to Medicare’s, and mailed a personalized
report.11
A small fraction of pharmacies offered personalized in-store assistance with plan choice to
auditors who walked in. In four of the 88 pharmacies audited, staff people made personalized
plan suggestions based on a Plan Finder. In five pharmacies (all in one chain), a staff person
offered personalized plan information about the entire universe of available plans. Sixty-nine of
the 88 pharmacies provided print materials. (Separately, tests we gave to recipients of print
materials indicated that these materials alone were not sufficient for seniors to understand the
cost implications of plan choice even in very simple cases.)
In sum, seniors could acquire personalized assistance from Medicare with minimal effort, but
seniors who sought information through other channels were not consistently assisted or even
consistently directed to Medicare. Personalized information was readily available but not widely
diffused.

VI. INTERVENTION IN THE CHOICE ENVIRONMENT
To examine the extent to which a reduction in comparison friction would affect plan choices,
we designed a randomized experiment in which the intervention lowered the cost of obtaining
and processing the information needed to make comparisons. Members of the intervention group
received a one page cover letter showing (1) the individual’s current plan and its predicted
annual cost conditional on their personalized drug profile, (2) the lowest-cost plan and its
11

In addition, a second major pharmacy chain offered an internet service in conjunction with a technology partner
specializing in decision support systems. A code was developed to trigger the import of individual medications into
the partner's Medicare Part D decision tool. Customers and pharmacy staff were able to produce personalized
Medicare Part D Plan comparisons by entering these codes into the tool.

predicted annual cost, (3) the potential savings from switching to the lowest-cost plan, and (4)
the date of the end of open enrollment. They also received a printout from the Medicare Plan
Finder including costs and other data on all available plans. The comparison group received a
general letter referring them to the Medicare website. Both groups received an informational
booklet on how to use the site. (For examples of these letters and the booklet, see the Appendix).
The intervention included a recommended default option (the lowest-cost plan), a clear statement
of that option’s benefits (potential savings), and a deadline. It neither contained difficult to
acquire information nor reduced the effort required to change plans.

VI.A. Baseline Characteristics
At the time of the baseline interview, participants reported regularly using an average of five
and half medications. The study participants were all from Wisconsin, nearly all white, with an
average age of 75. About two-thirds were women, about two-thirds were married, and about half
were college graduates (see Table II). Relative to the national population of seniors, study
participants were typical in terms of age and gender but were more likely to be married and were
substantially better educated.
The potential savings from changing plans, as a share of current expenditure, was similar in
our intervention sample and in our entirely separate sample of pharmacy claims data—
suggesting that the study did not disproportionately attract those who stood to benefit financially
from changing plans. Specifically, predicted consumer cost could be reduced an average of 30
percent in our intervention sample by switching to the lowest-cost plan. The corresponding
reduction was between 24 and 41 percent in the pharmacy claims sample. (The reason for the
range is that among plans offered by a particular plan sponsor, we could not determine the

17

specific plan currently covering an individual in many instances. The smaller potential savings is
based on a calculation using the lowest-cost plan among those offered by a sponsor, and the
larger potential savings is based on imputation from the sponsor’s highest-cost plan.)
Although the proportional potential savings was similar, the level of expenditure on
prescription drugs was substantially higher in our intervention sample than samples more
representative of the general population, including our pharmacy claims and national samples.
For example, Domino et al. (2008) projected costs under Part D for a nationally representative
sample deriving medication usage from the Medicare Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The
average 2006 predicted cost in the lowest-cost plan for individuals in the MEPS was $1114,
which was 30 percent lower than the corresponding 2007 predicted cost of $1593 for the lowestcost plans in our intervention sample. That difference is probably due to the intervention sample
being drawn from a list of patients with recent clinical visits (and tending to have more health
problems and higher levels of prescription drug use), and also to being from a more recent year.
Individual characteristics for the 406 individuals with complete data from both the baseline
survey in 2006 and the 2007 follow-up survey were similar for those assigned to the intervention
and comparison groups, although the intervention group had a higher fraction age 75 or older and
a higher fraction whose satisfaction with their 2006 plan was fair or poor.

VI.B. Percentile Rank in Cost of Chosen Plans
As context for understanding the potential savings from switching plans during open
enrollment, we examined the percentile rank in cost of chosen plans in the distribution of
available plans, as calculated based on the medication usage reported in our baseline survey.
There were 54 Medicare prescription drug plans available to beneficiaries in our Wisconsin

18

sample. The baseline plans initially enrolled in for 2006 by the individuals in our sample were
nearer the median-cost plan than the lowest-cost plan among all those offered: the average rank
was at the 39th percentile.
To see how the baseline plans compared to other plans of similar benefit type, we grouped
the plans into three different types. “Basic” included: plans with a deductible, 25 percent cost
sharing, then a coverage gap, and then catastrophic coverage (known as defined standard plans);
actuarially equivalent plans with the same deductible as a defined standard plan but a different
cost sharing structure (known as actuarially equivalent standard plans); and actuarially
equivalent plans with a reduced or eliminated deductible and a different cost sharing structure
(known as basic alternative plans). “Enhanced without gap” included plans with actuarial value
exceeding the defined standard plan and no cost sharing in the coverage gap. “Enhanced with
gap” included plans with actuarial value exceeding the defined standard plan and with cost
sharing in the coverage gap (only for generic drugs, except for one plan).
There is considerable variation in the consumer costs among basic plans, which are identical
or actuarially equivalent to the standard plan in terms of insurance value. One plan was the
lowest cost of the basic plans for about half the individuals in our sample, but fourteen different
plans were the lowest-cost basic plan for others–depending on the drugs they took. On average,
the baseline plan was at the 38th percentile of basic plans (among those who reported enrollment
in a basic plan for 2006 in the baseline survey). For individuals with enhanced plans without gap
coverage in 2006, the baseline plan was at the 43rd percentile of predicted consumer costs among
plans of that type. For those having enhanced plans with gap coverage in 2006, the baseline plan
was at the 50th percentile of costs among that type of plan. (For analysis of the differences in

19

dollars of cost between baseline plans and the lowest-cost plans by benefit type, see the
Appendix.)
In addition to analysis of percentile rank of predicted costs based on drugs taken in 2006, we
also examined costs based on the drugs actually taken throughout 2007 as reported in the 2008
follow-up interview. That percentile was similar—37th for actual costs versus 39th for predicted
costs—when plans of all benefit types were compared. For actual costs among basic plans
(among people who had that type plan in 2006), the percentile rank of 35th was slightly higher
than for predicted costs. Among enhanced plans without and with gap coverage (again, among
people who had that type of plan in 2006), the percentile ranks were 37th and 49th, respectively.
Thus, it appears that both ex-ante and ex-post there were numerous options for reducing
consumer costs among all plans and among plans of the same benefit type.

VI.C. Intervention Impacts
Switching in 2007. 28 percent of those in the group receiving the letter intervention switched
plans between 2006 and 2007, compared to 17 percent in the comparison group.12 The difference
of 11.5 percentage points is found in a simple comparison of means (see Table III).
We also estimated the effect of the intervention (Z) on plan switching (D) using linear
regression and controlling for covariates (X) known at the time of random assignment—
including the age and plan rating variables where there were some differences between the
comparison and intervention groups as discussed above—as in equation (4).
(4)

12

The switching rate in the comparison group is more than twice as high as the national average, which is likely
related to the higher rates of drug utilization and the higher plan dissatisfaction in our sample.
20

After regression adjustment, the estimated difference is 9.8 percentage points. The probability of
such a large difference occurring by chance under the null hypothesis of no effect of the
intervention is very small, with p-values less than 0.02 for both specifications. People rating their
baseline plan as fair or poor were ten percentage points more likely switch plans, holding other
factors constant. The regression-adjusted impact of the intervention on switching is slightly
lower than the simple comparison of means primarily because of the interaction between those
marginal effects and the higher baseline prevalence of those low satisfaction ratings in the
intervention group than in the comparison group.
The average time spent on all aspects of plan consideration and possible switching was 3
hours in the comparison group. Exploring seniors’ choice process and knowledge, we found that
several of the differences between the two groups supported the notion that the intervention
worked through cognitive channels. These included statistically significantly greater percentages
of intervention group members later reporting that they remembered receiving the materials, that
they read them, and that they found them helpful.
Predicted 2007 Costs. To estimate effects on costs, we used the same approach as in equation
(4) except with change in cost as the dependent variable. Specifically, the change in cost
(

) is the 2007 predicted consumer cost of the plan selected for 2007 minus that cost for the

baseline plan that had been selected in 2006. The average regression-adjusted decrease in predicted

cost for the entire intervention group versus the comparison group was $103 (see Table III).
Expressed in terms of the change relative to 2006, again estimated using the same approach as in
equation (4) but with log of the relative change in cost [ln

/

)] as the dependent variable, this

decrease was an average of 0.064 log points. Again, the probability of such a large difference
occurring by chance under the null hypothesis was less than 0.005. (The average cost change for

21

the entire intervention group versus the comparison group averages over people who were not
affected by the intervention and those who potentially were affected. Estimates for those affected
are discussed in the Appendix.)
Covariates other than the intervention indicator had little power to explain the changes in
consumer cost between the baseline 2006 plan and the plan selected in 2007. Holding other
factors constant, the indicator for seven or more medications was associated with a reduction in
predicted consumer cost of $112, indicating that people with higher levels of medication use
chose plans in 2007 resulting in larger reductions in predicted consumer costs than people with
less use.
Potential Variability of 2007 Costs. Plans differed in the extent to which costs could be
higher or lower if medication use were to change in the future. To create a measure of that
potential variability, we used our data on the predicted consumer cost of every plan offered for
each of the 406 individuals in our sample. For each plan, we then calculated the difference
between the 90th and 10th percentiles of the predicted 2007 consumer cost among individuals that
reported taking a similar number of medications in the baseline survey. (Specifically, the
percentiles were calculated within three subsamples: 0-3 medications, 4-6 medications, and 7 or
more medications.) This approach—similar to that used by Abaluck and Gruber (2011)—
implicitly assumes that the experiences of other members of our sample with similar medication
use represent the range of potential variability for each individual. Because of the small samples
sizes used, however, that assumption only holds very roughly, and that measure is also
imprecise.
The sample average for that measure of potential variability was about $2900 for the 2006
plans used at the time of the baseline survey. In analysis of the change in that measure between

22

the 2006 plan and the 2007 plan for each individual, using the same approach as in equation (4),
potential variability for the intervention group was $10 less than the comparison group (with a
standard error of $36). Thus, we did not find evidence that the intervention caused individuals to
switch to plans that had greater potential variability according to this measure.13
Actual 2007 Costs. In terms of the impacts on consumer cost as measured for the respondents
to the 2008 follow-up survey, the predicted 2007 cost was $111 lower for the intervention group
and the actual cost was $137 lower—although the standard error was 4 times larger for the
impact on actual cost (see Table IV).14 In addition to allowing more precise estimation, we
focused our primary analysis on the predicted 2007 consumer cost of the plan chosen for 2007
rather than the actual 2007 cost because the predicted cost uses the information set available to
individuals when they were making their plan choice during open enrollment prior to 2007,
which corresponds to the predictable component of costs discussed in section III. Also, the
predicted 2007 cost has less attrition, since it is based on our 2007 follow-up survey.
Along with having similar impacts for actual and predicted costs, those two measures were
fairly similar at the individual level. The correlation between the actual cost and the predicted
cost was 0.68; excluding the three most extreme differences, the correlation between actual and
predicted costs was 0.79.15 Comparing the actual and predicted costs of the 2007 plan selected by

13

We also used other measures of dispersion, such as the standard deviation and interquartile range, and found
effects that were also statistically insignificant.
14
The actual 2007 cost is based on drug list information collected in 2008 (as is the predicted 2008 and 2009 cost),
whereas predicted 2007 cost uses the 2006 baseline drug list. Since the baseline data is used in the calculation of the
predicted 2007 cost of both the 2007 and 2006 plans and their difference is used in the estimation, the estimate of
the effect of the intervention on that outcome is much more precise that the estimates of the effect on the actual 2007
cost. That is, the outcomes derived from the information collected in 2008 have much more variability in cost that is
not removed by subtracting the predicted 2007 cost of the 2006 plan. The impacts in log points estimated based on
the 2008 follow-up survey data also show more instability in magnitude and sign that those based on the 2007
follow-up survey, consistent with the imprecise nature of those estimates.
15
In a regression of actual realized cost on predicted consumer cost for the 2007 plan selected (based on drugs taken
in 2006), adding the demographic characteristics gathered in 2006 (gender, marital status, education, age, number of
medications, plan satisfaction) to the model increased the R-squared from 0.47 to 0.52, with significant coefficients
on having seven or more medications and having low plan satisfaction.
23

the individual, the actual cost was an average of $354 higher than predicted cost among
respondents to our 2008 follow-up survey. In the distribution of differences between actual and
potential costs, the actual cost was $1872 higher at the 90th percentile, $51 higher at the median,
and $663 lower at the 10th percentile.16
Quality in 2007. Our 2008 follow-up survey also collected self-reported information on
experiences in the plan during 2007. There were no statistically significant differences in
satisfaction with non-cost features or in overall plan ratings, although the point estimates go in
the direction of relatively more dissatisfaction with non-cost features and less dissatisfaction
overall for the intervention group (see Table IV). Thus, it is possible that individuals chose
lower-cost plans that had lower quality; we do not have sufficient statistical power to reject a
hypothesis of small reductions in quality. Analysis of other measures of administrative quality at
the plan sponsor level showed essentially no impact.
Switching in 2008. In another assessment of choices from our 2008 follow-up survey, we
examined whether individuals were sufficiently satisfied with their choices in 2007 to keep them
for 2008 after receiving another opportunity to switch plans. 23 percent of the comparison group
switched in 2008, and 20 percent of the intervention group switched—a statistically insignificant
difference—implying that the intervention group was at least as satisfied as the comparison
group overall in terms of their revealed preferences.
Predicted 2008 and 2009 Costs. The impacts on 2008 and 2009 predicted costs were of
roughly the same magnitude as both the predicted and actual costs for 2007 (see Table IV). Like

16

When calculated as an average over all possible plans, rather than the 2007 plan selected by the individual, the
actual cost was $339 higher than predicted cost. In the distribution of differences, the actual cost was $1888 higher
at the 90th percentile, $50 higher at the median, and $838 lower at the 10th percentile. In terms of the ratio of the
actual to the predicted costs, at the 90th percentile the actual was about 90 percent higher, and at the 10th percentile
the actual was about 30 percent lower. The correlation of the within-person ranks of 2007 actual and predicted cost
was 0.70.
24

those actual costs, they were imprecisely estimated. We interpret these results as being consistent
with continued savings over time due to the intervention, but we also could not reject a null
hypothesis of no impact at conventional levels of statistical significance.

VI.D. Role of the Lowest-Cost Plan
We found some evidence that more aspects of the intervention mattered for decision-making
than simply the identification of the lowest-cost plan. The intervention letter sent in the fall of
2006 named the plan with the lowest predicted consumer cost in 2007, based on reported
prescription drug use, and gave the predicted cost and calculated the difference in cost relative to
the 2006 plan. An attachment to the intervention letter also showed the predicted cost of each
plan. We found that 9 percent of the intervention group switched specifically to the lowest-cost
plans while 20 percent switched to a different plan; in the comparison group these percentages
were 2 percent (statistically significantly different from 9 percent) and 15 percent (not
statistically significantly different from 20 percent). This result is consistent with the idea that
the intervention specifically caused seniors to consider the lowest-cost plan, and also that seniors
gave additional consideration to the personalized cost of plans other than the lowest-cost plan.
As a complement to the analysis of the impact of the intervention on switching rates and
average predicted costs and to give more structure to the estimated effects, we also examined
differences between the intervention and comparison groups in discrete choice models of plan
selection. As a point of departure for this analysis, consider selecting a plan at random, which is
equivalent to a discrete choice model with coefficients of zero on explanatory variables. The
probability of plan selection from among 54 plans would be 1/54 = 0.019. To examine the
probability of selecting plans of different prices, we formulated a conditional logit model for

25

individual i and plan j estimated using comparison group data only and controlling for individual
fixed effects ( ), predicted cost (

), and predicted cost squared, based on the indirect utility

function in equation (5), with utility (

) and an error term (

).17

(5)
Results using that model estimate the predicted probability of choosing a plan in 2007 with the
same price as that actually selected was 0.025, indicating some sensitivity to price.
We then enriched this basic model, to examine any effect of being the lowest-cost plan
(beyond what would be predicted by cost alone) and to analyze differences between the
intervention and comparison groups in the sensitivity of plan selection to cost in general and to
the lowest-cost plan in particular. The enriched model added an intervention group indicator ( )
and interactions of that indicator with predicted cost and predicted cost squared, an indicator for
being the lowest-cost plan for that individual (

), and the interaction of lowest-cost plan with

the intervention group indicator—as well as 2006 baseline plan choice (

) and plan fixed

effects ( ), which improve precision of the estimates and also cause plans selected by fewer than
2 individuals in the sample to drop out of this analysis. That model is based on the indirect utility

function in equation (6); all explanatory variables in the model were known at the time of
random assignment.
(6)
We conducted three versions of the analysis based on this equation: plan choices in 2007 for the
full sample of 2007 follow-up survey respondents, plan choices in 2007 for the sample of 2008

17

We also experimented with modeling the effects of price more and less flexibly. The quadratic specification was
selected because of its parsimony, fit to the data, and robustness to outliers.
26

follow-up survey respondents, and plan choices in 2008 for the full sample of 2008 follow-up
survey respondents.
The results for all three versions indicate that the intervention group is significantly more
sensitive to cost than the comparison group (see Table V). For the intervention group, the
estimates for the first version of the analysis imply that a twenty-five percent decrease in
predicted cost (say from $2120 to $1590, or from the 2007 average cost of the plan chosen in
2006 to roughly the average of the lowest-cost plans in 2007—with marginal effects calculated
as the sum of 1000 changes of 51.1 cents each) increased the odds of plan selection by 2.7. That
is, it increased the probability of selection from 0.025 to 0.070. If that lower cost plan was also
the lowest-cost plan, the estimated odds ratio was 8.2, and the probability of selection further
rose to 0.27. In the comparison group, a twenty-five percent decrease in predicted cost increased
the probability of plan selection only from 0.025 to 0.040. If the lower cost plan was also the
lowest-cost plan, the probability of selection further rose only from 0.040 to 0.062 in the
comparison group. The test of whether the coefficient on the interaction term of the differential
effect of the lowest-cost plan in the intervention group relative to the comparison group was
equal to zero generated a p-value of 0.09. A joint test of whether the coefficients on the cost and
cost-squared interactions terms were equal to zero also yielded a p-value of 0.09, while the joint
test of whether the coefficients on all three cost interactions terms were zero yielded a p-value of
less than 0.005. This evidence is consistent with the effect of changes in the choice environment
working through both increased sensitivity to the entire vector of costs for all plans and in
particular to the lowest-cost plan.
The estimates for prediction of 2008 plan selection in the third version of the analysis show
that the interactions of cost with the intervention were somewhat smaller and the impact of the

27

lowest-cost plan was somewhat larger than for 2007 plan selection. These results imply that a
twenty-five percent decrease in predicted cost in 2007 and being the lowest-cost plan in 2007
increased the estimated odds ratio to 9.9, i.e. the probability of selection in 2008 rose from 0.025
to 0.40. These results are very similar to those from the second version of the analysis, for 2007
plan selection limited to individuals for whom we observe 2008 data, where a twenty-five
percent decrease in predicted cost and being the lowest-cost plan increased the probability of
selection from 0.025 to 0.38. That is, the 2007 cost information provided in the intervention
continued to have an effect of essentially the same magnitude on 2008 plan selection.

VI.E. Impacts on Subgroups
As discussed earlier, our sample was more educated, less satisfied with their baseline plans,
and had higher dollar value of potential saving from switching to the lowest-cost plan than a
national sample would have had. To examine the sensitivity of our results to these factors, we
examined impacts within subgroups by education, plan satisfaction, and potential savings. We
also examined the subgroups of people in baseline plans with small and large insurer market
shares, and in baseline plans with basic versus enhanced coverage.18
Education. Our sample is quite highly educated, but estimated impacts for non-college
graduates are actually larger than for college graduates, and for both subgroups the null
hypothesis of no effect can be rejected at the 5 percent level of significance (see Table VI).
These results are consistent with the notion that any limits in comprehending information by
less-educated groups are offset by the marginal value of information to these groups.

18

These analyses were exploratory. Under the null hypothesis of no impact of the intervention on consumer cost, the
probability that the maximum t-statistic among the 20 comparisons examined in this section would be 1.96 or higher
in absolute value is much greater than 5 percent. The hypothesis testing throughout this paper treats each
comparison separately, and does not adjust for multiple comparisons.
28

Plan Satisfaction. The proportion of our sample that rated their 2006 baseline plan as fair or
poor is much higher than that in national samples (including our telephone survey and data from
Medicare) who say they were neither satisfied or dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, or very
dissatisfied with their plans. Our sample probably had a high proportion dissatisfied with their
plans because they were the people willing to volunteer to participate in our study about drug
plan choice. The impacts are larger for the more dissatisfied subgroup (although imprecisely
estimated), but quite substantial (and statistically significantly different from zero) even for those
who rated their 2006 plan good or better—indicating that the results were not driven primarily by
the dissatisfaction of participants with their plans.
Potential Savings. The potential savings from switching to the lowest-cost plan was greater
in our sample in dollars and similar in percentage terms to a national sample. The impacts in
dollars for those with potential savings less than $400 were much smaller (although statistically
significantly different from zero) than for those with greater potential savings. The impacts in
relative terms were 0.052 and 0.075 log points for those two groups, respectively. These results
suggest that the impact in percentage terms for a sample with nationally representative potential
savings would probably have been only slightly smaller than that estimated for the full 2007
Wisconsin follow-up survey sample.
Insurer Market Share. We had initially speculated that individuals with relatively low
knowledge of drug plans and drug costs might have placed a high weight on name-recognition
and popularity, as potential signals of quality, and had chosen insurers with high enrollment in
their plans in 2006. (For example, the plan with the highest national enrollment in 2006 was cobranded by AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons.) We hypothesized
that when the intervention made personalized cost information available to individuals in these

29

plans, they would be relatively more likely to switch plans. We found the opposite result.
Individuals in plans with insurer market share of less than 15 percent were more likely to
respond to the intervention by switching plans and enjoyed greater cost savings. Ex-post, the
results are more consistent with the idea that large market share plans attracted members who
highly valued a trusted brand or other non-cost attributes and were relatively less sensitive to
personalized cost information.
Benefit Type. The impact on switching by benefit type was essentially the same—about 11
percentage points. The rate of switching from enhanced plans to enhanced plans was similar in
the intervention and comparison groups, but the rate of switching from enhanced to basic plans
was much higher in the intervention group. The impact on predicted consumer cost in log points
was similar for those with basic and enhanced plans at baseline. The higher level of predicted
consumer cost among people with enhanced plans at baseline translated into larger impacts in
dollars. In sum, the intervention resulted in lower costs among people with both benefit types at
baseline. For those with enhanced plans at baseline, those lower costs appear to have been
primarily the result of switching to basic plans.

VI.F. Reduction of Comparison Friction and Stated Preferences
To obtain supplemental evidence about how individuals respond to a reduction in comparison
friction, we presented seniors with several sets of plan characteristics including those of the plan
they had chosen for themselves and asked them to indicate which they preferred. Following a
technique developed by Bernartzi and Thaler (2002), our 2008 follow-up survey asked seniors to
evaluate the choice between several pairs of unnamed drug plans based on cost measures, plan
size, and Medicare quality ratings. In these questions, the cost information was personalized

30

using the information they had provided about medication use in the 2006 baseline survey and
was similar to the information that the intervention group had received via the Medicare printout; the enrollment and quality information were new.
When seniors in the comparison group compared their 2007 plan to their 2006 plan (among
those who had changed plans during those years), 61 percent did not select their 2007 plan.
When seniors who had not chosen the lowest-cost plan in 2007 were asked to compare their 2007
plan to the lowest-cost plan at that time, 63 percent of the comparison group did not select their
2007 plan. This evidence shows how a reduction in comparison friction (that is, providing
personalized information about the unnamed plans) shifted stated preferences away from the
actual choices, which is consistent with the substantial impact such a reduction had on actual
consumer choices as observed in our field experiment. For the intervention group the analogous
results were that 52 percent did not select their 2007 plan over the lowest-cost plan and 16
percent did not select their 2007 plan over their 2006 plan (among those who switched plans),
indicating that the shift in stated preferences away from the actual choices was smaller among
the intervention group for which comparison friction had been previously reduced during 2006
open enrollment when actual choices were made.

VII. DISCUSSION
We interpret the results of our field experiment to indicate that an intervention which reduced
comparison friction had a substantial impact on consumer choices, as it increased the percentage
who switched plans from 17 percent to 28 percent and reduced predicted consumer cost by about
$100 per person in our Wisconsin sample. Our examination of the choice environment found that
information to facilitate comparisons was accessible at quite low cost (say, by calling 1-800-

31

Medicare), but that only 18 percent of individuals nationally had ever used personalized cost
information. Why didn’t people seek out and use the available information?
One potential reason people may not have used this information is that the gains are not as
large as they appear. Suppose that individuals face high costs from the act of switching plans.
The net gains from switching are then smaller than the cost savings alone. This means that the
benefits of undertaking comparative research will be lower. Put simply, high switching costs
would make it less valuable to investigate options than our cost savings would imply. However,
consider the implications if it were the case that essentially all the potential savings from the
intervention were offset by switching costs. Say that 17 percent of individuals would have
switched if they had been assigned to the comparison group, and therefore would have saved
enough to compensate them for switching costs without the intervention; thus, in this case where
potential savings are essentially offset by switching costs there would be no effect on potential
savings for these individuals because the intervention did not cause them to switch or increase
switching costs. Then the intervention caused only 10 percent of individuals to switch plans. In
this case then the overall effect of $103 per person in potential savings from receiving a letter
would have been a combination of no effect on 90 percent of individuals and $1030 per person
caused to switch. Since the act of switching itself could be accomplished in a phone call, this
case seems implausible and we conclude such switching costs were very unlikely to have fully
offset the potential savings from the intervention. Switching costs less than $100 per person
caused to switch seem more plausible.
Individuals may have expected the costs of understanding the forms and adjusting to the
procedures of a new plan to be higher than the costs directly related to the act of switching. That
uncertainty is a form of comparison friction that our intervention—which focused on premiums

32

plus out-of-pocket expenditures—did not reduce. If individuals had greater knowledge of these
factors for their current plan and did not have an effective way to learn about them for other
plans, then again the net benefits of alternative choice would have been lower and comparative
research would have been less likely to be worthwhile. These factors probably contributed to the
low use of personalized cost information.
In our view, a key reason people did not seek personalized comparative information was that
they had biased expectations about how much they could save from switching plans. We asked
participants in the comparison group during our 2007 follow-up interview how much they
thought they could save if they had chosen the least expensive plan. Of those who could give an
estimate, more than 70 percent gave an underestimate, and the average underestimate was more
than $400. Because they thought the value of comparative research was going to be low, they did
not undertake it.
Biased expectations about costs may have combined with confirmation and status-quo biases
(the tendency to stick with one’s existing opinions and choices), procrastination, limited
attention, and small transaction costs to generate high rates of reported satisfaction and low rates
of change. Our intervention, while modest, challenged these tendencies by altering price and
market perceptions, countering confirmation bias (by showing the savings available), and
providing an alternative default (the lowest-cost plan). Our results suggest that the mechanisms
underlying the intervention impact increased sensitivity to plan cost in general, and to the lowestcost plan highlighted in the letter in particular.

VIII. DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
This study highlights four areas for further research. One is very concrete work on the design
of clear, actionable information about Medicare drug plans or other health insurance coverage
choices. Our work shows the potential for information to have an effect, although the study
intervention incorporated multiple features including partnership with a trusted hospital, the
priming effect of an in-person interview, a behaviorally sensitive letter, the full Medicare printout, and a mailing that both communicated personalized information about potential savings and
raised general awareness about the potential for savings and the nature of the variation among
plans. Additional work could unbundle these effects, with potential implications for the design of
larger scale programs, and could explore the effects of quality as well as cost information. Tools
for creating more sophisticated price information could also be developed that would
incorporate, for example, forecasts of changes in drug use, rather than simply assume that next
year’s use will be the same as the previous year’s use.
Another area for further research is the role of product and information markets in reducing
comparison friction. It is striking that, despite the apparent value of personalized comparative
information, few third parties emerged to provide it, or even to highlight its potential value and
steer seniors towards Medicare and its local partners. The actual provision of information may
have been impeded by CMS regulations that constrained the role of third parties and by the effort
involved in working with seniors one-on-one, although third parties with access to drug histories
can provide personalized information relatively efficiently. Among the challenges in facilitating
an expanded role for third parties would be the need to minimize the potential for plans to
capture the market for advice, to respect individual privacy, to provide information that balanced
cost and other considerations, and to hold beneficiaries’ well-being as the greatest value.

34

Possibilities to explore could be one-on-one counseling and the ability for beneficiaries and their
advisors to manually update an automatically generated drug list.
A third area involves the potential response of insurance firms to broader provision of
personalized price information. For example, if the information provided assumed last year’s
drug use is the same as next year’s drug use, then firms would have strong incentives to cut
prices on drugs used for short periods and increase prices on drugs used for long periods to
encourage individuals to perceive their costs to be lower than they would actually be. In contexts
of increased price salience, there would also be greater incentives for firms to cut costs which
could lead to lower overall quality of service.
A fourth area for more conceptual research is the interaction between comparison friction
and various forms of market failure at both the theoretical and the more practical level. In the
case of Medicare drug plans, the private and public optima may differ, and comparison friction
may actually counteract market failure by reducing the extent of adverse selection and
contributing to the success of the voluntary insurance market. Market functioning could be
harmed if all plans with more than basic coverage attract only those for whom those plans are
least costly (with these plans then becoming too expensive and being dropped), or if all
individuals chose one low-cost provider who then obtained enough market power to keep out
new entrants and also set monopolistic prices in future periods.

for
COMPARISON FRICTION:
EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM MEDICARE DRUG PLANS

Jeffrey R. Kling, Sendhil Mullainathan, Eldar Shafir, Lee Vermeulen, and Marian V. Wrobel

September 2011

This appendix consists of three parts:
A. Potential cost savings from plan switching by benefit type
B. Intervention impacts assuming some participants were not affected
C. Examples of materials used in the intervention

45

A. Potential cost savings from plan switching by benefit type

Using data from the baseline survey on drugs taken in 2006, the average predicted consumer
savings from switching to the lowest-cost plan in 2007 of any benefit type was $527. Those
savings from switching to the lowest-cost plan of the same benefit type as the individual had in
2006 ranged from $386 to $464 (see Table A-1).
We also examined information on drugs actually taken in 2007 from our 2008 follow-up
survey. The average actual savings from switching to the lowest-cost plan in 2007 of any benefit
type was $487. Those savings from switching to the lowest-cost plan of the same benefit type as
the individual had in 2006 ranged from $337 to $392.
The average consumer cost among all 2007 basic plans was $2334. In comparison to the
lowest-cost basic plan for each individual, the 27 other basic plans had predicted consumer costs
$705 greater on average.

Notes. The baseline plan is the plan in which the individual was enrolled in 2006. The dollar
difference is the cost in 2007 of lowest-cost plan minus that of the baseline plan. The percentile rank
the rank of the cost of the lowest-cost plan minus the baseline plan (where zero provided the most
savings and 100 provided the least savings). The sample for rows 1-3 is limited to plans of the same
type as the baseline plan. The sample size for potential costs was 224, 73, 109, and 406 for rows 1-4
respectively in columns 1 and 3; for actual costs it was 155, 58, 85 and 298 for those rows in
columns 2 and 4.

B. Intervention impacts assuming some participants were not affected

The intervention impacts on predicted consumer cost discussed in the main text are intent-totreat estimates which compare the outcomes for all members of the intervention group to those of
the comparison group. However, the change in predicted consumer cost is zero by definition for
individuals who did not switch plans. Thus, the intent-to-treat estimates average together impacts
on those potentially affected by the intervention with a large proportion of zeros for those not
affected. This section explores how different assumptions about the proportion of the sample not
affected scales up the point estimates and standard errors of those who were potentially affected.
Define A as an indicator of being potentially affected by the intervention, where A involves
the counterfactual and cannot be directly observed. Define D as an observed indicator for
switching plans, and Z as an indicator for assignment to the intervention group. Define Y as the
difference in predicted consumer cost of the plan selected for 2007 and the baseline plan in 2006,
Y1 as the potential outcome if an individual were assigned to the intervention group, Y0 as the
potential outcome if an individual were assigned to the comparison group. The causal effect of
the intervention is then Y1-Y0.
There was a causal effect for any individual who would have chosen a plan with a different
predicted consumer cost in the intervention group than in the comparison group. These situations
included having the intervention cause someone to switch to a lower cost plan (Y1<0; Y0=0),
having the intervention cause someone who was going to choose a more expensive plan to not
switch (Y1=0; Y0>0), and other cases (anytime Y1 ≠ Y0). A special case was when someone
would not switch plans regardless of the intervention, so there was no effect on cost. The upper
bound on the probability of this special case occurred when everyone who switched plans in one

47

group would have switched if assigned to the other group (1- max{E[D | Z=1], E[D | Z=0]}). The
lower bound on the probability of this special case occurred when no one who switched plans in
one group would have switched if assigned to the other group (1- {E[D | Z=1] + E[D | Z=0]}).
Intuitively, we can use the lower bound on the fraction of zeros included in the estimate of the
average cost change for the entire intervention group versus the comparison group to calculate a
lower bound on the average cost change for those who potentially were affected by the
intervention. This bound is based on the derivation in equation (B1).19

E[Y1-Y0 | A=1]Pr(A=1) + 0

≤

E[Y1-Y0 | A=1]{E[D | Z=1] + E[D | Z=0]}

This approach is similar to that used by Imbens and Angrist (1994) to estimate a local
average treatment effect (LATE), where those who did not comply and take up the treatment
offer are assumed to have been unaffected. However, the approach used here is less restrictive.
The exclusion restriction required for LATE, but not needed for (B1), is that people who would
have switched plans even without the intervention would not be affected; relaxing this
assumption is sometimes described as allowing effects on “always-takers.” LATE also involves
an assumption of monotonicity, not needed for (B1), where the intervention only encourages
switching; relaxation of this assumption is sometimes referred to as allowing “defiers.” We can
now calculate an expression based for a lower bound on the average cost change for those who
were potentially affected by the intervention, shown in equation (B2).
19

The first line of equation uses the definition of potential outcomes. The second line uses the independence of
potential outcomes from randomly assigned groups. The third line uses the definition of conditional expectation. The
fourth line uses the definition of A, where Y1-Y0= 0 when A=0. The fifth line uses the lower bound described in the
text, where Pr(A=0) = 1-Pr(A=1) <= 1- {E[D | Z=1] + E[D | Z=0]}.
48

(B2)

E[Y1-Y0|A=1] ≥{E[Y | Z=1]- E[Y | Z=0]} / {E[D | Z=1] + E[D | Z=0]}

In this paper’s application, the lower bound point estimates and standard errors simply rescale
the intent-to-treat estimates by 1/{E[D | Z=1] + E[D | Z=0]}, or 2.2 (see Table B-1). There is a
small amount of negative covariance between the estimation of average cost differences and
switching rates, and accounting for this slightly reduces the standard errors; for simplicity, this
adjustment is not included in the results.
Our intuition is that the exclusion restriction does not hold in this application but
monotonicity probably does. The exclusion restriction would be violated if those in the
comparison group who would have switched without the intervention nevertheless had their
predicted consumer cost affected by the intervention. Monotonicity would be violated if the
intervention caused some people to not switch who would have otherwise switched. If we did not
impose the exclusion restriction but assume monotonicity holds—that is, allow effects on
“always-takers” but assume no “defiers”—then then we would obtain treatment-on-treated
results from rescaling by 1/E[D | Z=1] instead of 1/{E[D | Z=1] + E[D | Z=0]}, as in equation
(B3).

(B3)

E[Y1-Y0|A=1] = {E[Y | Z=1]- E[Y | Z=0]} / E[D | Z=1]

Estimates of treatment-on-treated effects based on (B3) generate point estimates about 3.6 times
larger than the lower bound on the potentially affected group based on (B2).
The regression-adjusted estimate of the treatment-on-treated effect for the full sample is $369
(see Table B-1). That turns out to be very similar to the non-experimental estimate that compares
the savings of those who switched plans in the intervention group (who had potential savings that
averaged $469) to those who switched plans in the comparison group (who had potential savings
49

that averaged $97), where the difference is $372. Because the potential savings for non-switchers
is zero by construction, if there were no regression adjustment and the switching rates in the two
groups were the same then treatment-on-treated estimate would exactly equal the difference
between switchers in potential savings; in this application, the regression adjustment and lower
switching rate in the comparison group roughly offset each other.

Notes. Estimates are with regression adjustment using the models in Table III, columns 4 and 6,
estimated separately for each subgroup, and modified as follows: columns (1) and (2) are based on
equation (B2), and multiply the estimates by 1/(0.282+0.168); columns (3) and (4) are based on
equation (B3), and multiply the estimates by 1/0.282. All subgroups are defined on characteristics
known prior to random assignment. Dollar potential savings = predicted 2007 consumer cost of 2006
plan - predicted consumer cost of least expensive plan in 2007. Standard errors are in parentheses. *
= p-value < 0.05.

Introduction
In this booklet you will find information about how to use the tools available to help you make a decision about a Medicare prescription drug plan.
For those who have access to a computer and/or assistance from a computer user, Medicare has developed the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan
Finder. In this booklet you will find a step-by-step guide on how to do a
“General Search” of prescription drug plans. There are various other kinds of
searches that can be done, but our goal was to familiarize you with the tool
itself—enabling you to move on to other searches yourself later. For those
who do not have access to a computer and/or who are uncomfortable
working with this kind of a tool, there is also information about how to
enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan using the telephone. Either way,
we hope you will explore the new Medicare prescription drug coverage
options available to you—to see if it will help you save on your drug costs.
Finally, if you need more information before making a final decision, see the
“Other resource information” column on page 9.

*Prescription drugs are dispensed in a variety of ways—tablets,
capsules, patches, time-released, etc. Often this information is
entered in coded language on your pill container. The names of
some drugs may also be abbreviated because they are so long.
Thus, your pill container may not give you everything you need for
your drug list. It therefore might be a good idea to talk with your
pharmacist when making your list—and if you get all your drugs
from one place, your pharmacist may be willing to provide you
with a printout of your drug list.

2. Information about Your Current Insurance Coverage
(if any) such as a Medicare supplement, retiree coverage, Medicare Advantage (managed care) plan, VA,
TRICARE, or FEHB.

For Help on the Computer:
•

Ask a family member or friend to help you.

•

Contact the State Health Insurance Assistance
Program (SHIP). Call 1-800-633-4227 to learn the
number for your state’s SHIP. SHIP trains volunteers to
help people with their Medicare issues. Most are
computer savvy. Or,

If you were in a Medicare
Advantage Plan with prescription drug coverage prior
to 2006, your plan should
have informed you that you
would be enrolled in their
Medicare prescription drug
plan.
If you had retiree drug coverage through a former
employer or union, or a
Medicare supplemental plan
with drug benefits, prior to
2006, you should have been
notified by your plan provider
if your coverage is as good as
Medicare’s drug coverage.

1

Tips on using the
Medicare Speech
Automated System
It will ask you a series of
questions about what kind of
information you need. The
basic questions you will need
to answer are as follows:
1. If you are calling about
the new Medicare drug
coverage, say: “Drug
Coverage.”

•

If You Don’t Have Computer Access:
•

4. Please tell me your
Medicare Claim Number,
including any letters (it’s
on your Medicare card).
5. May I have your last
name, without spelling it?

•

•

•

•

6. What is your date of birth?
7. What was the starting
date of your Medicare
coverage? (This is on your
Medicare card.)
8. Our records show that you
are... (enrolled or not
enrolled in Medicare prescription drug plan).
9. If would like to speak with
an agent, you will need
your drug list and
Medicare card. Say:
“Agent.” This will bring a
customer service representative from Medicare
on to the line.

2

Call MEDICARE at 1-800-633-4227. Customer service
representatives will walk you through the Plan Finder.
If you request it, they will send you a “Customized
Print on Demand” booklet of the prescription drug
plans that might work best for you.

Tips for calling Medicare:

2. For information on how
the new prescription drug
plans work, say: “Plan
Choices.”
3. Do you have your
Medicare Card?

Call your local Area Agency on Aging at 1-800-6771116 to learn which office is the closest to you.

•

Medicare’s toll-free number is currently available 24
hours a day, 7 days a week. Try to call during non-peak
hours such as evenings or weekends, and try to avoid
Monday mornings.
You will need to have your list of drugs and dosages,
your Medicare card, your date of birth, and the date
you originally enrolled in Medicare (the date is on your
Medicare card) available when you call.
Write down any specific questions you have before
calling, and check your questions off as they are
answered when you call.
When you make the call, you may first get a “Speech
Automated System” (a computer) that will instruct you
to say your answers. If you decide to use this system,
you will need to speak slowly, distinctly, and loudly
enough for the computer to understand you. Also, try
to minimize any background noises that might make it
hard for you and the computer to hear.
If the response from the Medicare automated system is
that you are not enrolled in a plan, it will ask you to
please check back later because Medicare is updating
its records daily. So if you have enrolled already, wait
about a week and call Medicare back. If you haven’t
enrolled yet, and want to get Medicare drug coverage,
you will need to make a choice and enroll in a plan.
Say: “Enroll.”

•

If you dislike or have difficulty using a speech automated system, you can press zero (0) on your telephone to bypass the automated system. This may or
may not get you to a customer service operator right
away—depending upon how busy they are. It’s important to know, however, that calls are taken in the
order they are received—so hanging up and calling
back only puts you at the back of the line!

Extra Help for those
with limited income

If You Do Have Computer Access:

Extra Help is available if your
income and assets are below
these figures:

Once you have gathered your drug information, you are ready to
begin your prescription drug plan search, using the Medicare
Prescription Drug Plan Finder.

•

Income eligibility for Extra
Help is $14,355 (single) or
$19,245 (couple).*

•

Asset eligibility is $11,500
(single) or $23,000
(couple).

To keep your initial search simple, this tool focuses on “Stand
Alone” prescription drug plans associated with the traditional
Medicare fee-for-service program. By working through a “General
Search,” you will become better acquainted with the information
available through the Plan Finder.
To start your prescription drug plan search:

1. On the computer, go to the Internet, type:
www.medicare.gov, hit enter, and log onto the Medicare
website.

If it looks like your income is
less than these figures, even if
you have some doubts, it is a
good idea to apply for this
benefit, since it could provide:
•

Unlimited drug coverage
(no coverage gap).

•

Greatly reduced (or even
zero) monthly premiums.

•

Greatly reduced (or even
zero) annual deductible.

•

Co-pays of $1 to $5 or 15%
of the cost of each drug—
depending on income and
asset levels.

2. Click on Compare Medicare Prescription Drug Plans.
3. Scroll down to where you see (in blue) Where Would
You Like to Begin? Then, where you see, Find a
Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, click on the orange
arrow to the right.
4. Scroll down to the lower half of the page until you see a
button that says General Search and click on that
button.
5. Enter your Zip Code in the box that is provided. Do
not hit enter.

*Income figures will go up for
2006.

Note: In some cases, when you enter your zip code, you will get
another box that asks you to select your county. Click on the drop
down arrow and select your county, then click on Continue.

Generic check box
When you enter a drug name,
the computer automatically
checks to see if a generic drug
is available.
Generics will automatically
come up on your list of drugs

6. On the same page, scroll down and click on the box
that best describes your Current Prescription
Coverage. If you don’t know, click “None of the
Above.”

Note 3: If a particular drug does not appear on the Medicare Plan
Finder list, it is probably not covered by Medicare and you will have
to pay for the drug yourself—unless you qualify for another program such as Medicaid or a state pharmacy assistance program

7. On that same page, scroll down and select “yes” or
“no” to the question Eligible or Qualify For
Additional Help, then scroll down and click the
Continue button. (If you are not sure if you will
qualify for the Extra Help, check the eligibility information in the box in the shaded area on page 3.)

11. When you have completed entering your list of medications, click on Continue with Selected Drugs.

8. This will bring up the next window Decide on Your
Plan Options. At the bottom of the page, click on
Choose a Drug Plan Type.
—unless you uncheck the box
first (below).

Because generics are usually
less expensive than their
brand name equivalents, the
computer will also factor the
generics listed into the plan
costs. Therefore, the cost
quotes might be misleading,
if you intend to stay with a
brand name as opposed to a
generic.
You will have another chance
to do this kind of cost comparison later, so we suggest
you uncheck the box at this
point in your search.

4

9. Near the bottom of the page, click on the gray button
Search for Medicare Prescription Drug Plans.
10. Scroll down to Enter Your Medications, and click on
the gray button. Using the list of drugs you made earlier, type the name of your drug in the box that
appears, and click Search for Drug. Scroll down to
Review Your Drug List to see that drug name has been
entered. If you have more than one drug to enter, click
on Add Additional Drugs and enter the next drug.
Repeat for each drug used, clicking Add Selected Drug
to My List each time after typing in the name of your
drug. Don’t panic when the screen appears to go
blank—the computer is just doing its work.
Note 1: If you type the drug name incorrectly or just type in the
first few letters, the program will give you a drop-down screen
with a list of drugs to choose from that are close to what you’ve
entered—select the correct drug and then click on Add the Drug
to My List. You can also enter just the first letter of the drug
name (such as “L” for Lovastatin) and you will get a complete
listing of all drugs that start with that letter. If you find your drug
on this list, you then need to select it and click on Add the Drug
to My List.
Note 2: When all your drugs are listed, click on the little box below
the list. This will remove the check mark (see explanation in the
shaded box) from the box that says: “Use lower cost generics
when available.”

12. Next click on Change/Update My Drug Dosage. This
is one of the most important steps in the whole
process! You will get a more precise plan comparison if
you take the time to enter exact dosages and quantities. For example, if two pills are taken per day, change
the 30-day quantity to 60. To change the dosage, click
the drop-down arrow to the right of the drug name,
and then click Update Dosage/Quantity to make sure
all your changes have been registered. You next need to
click on Continue with Selected Drugs.
13. Scroll down to Choose How You Want to View Your
Plan. Click on Continue to Plan List rather than Select
My Preferred Pharmacy. You will have another chance
to do this later. You will then see a screen titled Find a
Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. Scroll down to the
Prescription Drug Plan Comparison multi-colored
chart that gives you plans for the zip code you entered,
starting with the one that is estimated to be least
expensive overall calculated for 30-day supplies from
local “preferred” pharmacies (those that are in the
plan’s network). You still need to compare plans, however, because there are other factors to think about.
Note: In order to view the information about the various plans, you
will click on the words in the column that are underlined (Plan
Information, Plan Name, # of Pharmacies, etc.). This will bring up
more detailed information about each plan. In order to move back
and forth between these columns, you should scroll down to the
bottom of the screen and click on the buttons that may say
Return to Personalized Search, Close Window, or Return to
Previous Page. You can also use your “back” button on your
computer in most cases to move back and forth between the
various windows.

“gap in coverage” or catastrophic level, and your
estimated monthly cost during the “gap” period.

16. In the Select to Compare column, click in the boxes to
the left of the plan names (up to three at a time) you
are interested in, and then scroll down and click the
button that says Compare Three Plans. Repeat for
more comparisons.
17. In the # of Pharmacies column, click on the # to get a
list of the pharmacies that are preferred by that particular plan.
By now you should be getting a feel for how the Medicare
Prescription Drug Plan Finder works. There is a lot of
information available at your fingertips—but it takes a
little practice to become comfortable using it—so take
your time and don’t be afraid to explore some of the other
search possibilities available. There will be times when
“traffic” is heavy on the Plan Finder. You may have to try at
another non-peak time, but don’t get discouraged. As the
“traffic jam” begins to break up, you’ll have access when
you want it.

Exploring similar
drugs to treat a
particular condition
AARP has developed an
online consumer guide to
help you find the most effective and affordable drugs. The
guide provides unbiased
information on drug safety,
effectiveness, and cost. It’s
based upon an independent
review and assessment of the
available medical evidence.
The guide shows how the
most expensive drugs are not
necessarily the best, and that
consumers willing to consult
with their doctor or pharmacist, can often find similar
safe and effective lower cost
drugs. To learn more about

Some other things to be aware of when using

1. Restrictions on certain drugs—Watch for a single
asterisk (*) to the right of a drug name in the “View
Cost Details” page. It means there are special rules that
apply, such as:
•

Prior Authorization: This means that you or your
doctor must obtain the plan’s approval before it will
cover a particular drug (often a high-priced one).
The physician generally has to document why this
specific medication is needed.

•

Step Therapy: This is a variation of prior authorization. It requires the physician to use a similar but

searches
Formulary Search:
Each plan has a formulary, or
its preferred list of drugs.
To do a Formulary Search, go
to www.medicare.gov, click
on Formulary Search. Enter
your state, then your list of
drugs. When the list of plans
is displayed, click on the
name of each plan to see in
which tier each of your drugs
falls. This won’t give you copays, however, so you’ll need
to go to “View Cost Details”
(see page 6) for that.

in the boxes, then click on

there, follow the same
basic steps as for the
“General Search.”

less expensive “preferred” drug to treat a condition
before being allowed to use the one originally prescribed.
2. Quantity Limits: This does NOT mean that your
supply of drugs will be cut off after a certain time—
or restricted to a particular number of prescriptions
per year. It does mean that your doctor must follow
your plan’s guidelines when prescribing drugs for a
current condition. If, for instance, your doctor writes a
prescription that falls outside your drug plan’s quantity
limit, he or she must get prior authorization from your
plan before the plan will agree to pay for the prescription. For example, prescriptions for sleeping pills need
to be monitored very closely by your doctor and therefore most will have a quantity limit associated with
them. In other words, if the normal course of treatment calls for a 10-day supply of pills, then your doctor
can’t write the prescription for more than that—unless
he or she has prior approval from the drug plan to do
so.
3. Co-payment/Coinsurance: This is the amount you pay
for each prescription after you have paid the
deductible. In some plans, you pay the same co-payment (a set amount) or coinsurance (a percentage of
the cost) for any prescription. In other plans, there
might be different levels or “tiers,” with different costs,
depending on which tier a particular drug is assigned.
Some plans may have co-payments for some drugs
and coinsurance for others.
4. “Tiered” co-payment levels: Typically, less expensive
drugs are assigned to lower tiers, with lower co-pay
amounts. Brand-name drugs may be further divided
into “preferred” and “non-preferred” tiers as well.
Further, some plans may dedicate another tier for less
common and/or very expensive drugs. With these
kinds of variations, it’s a good idea to compare not only
the monthly premium and annual deductible—but
also co-payments—when calculating your total costs.

8

5. Premiums and Deductibles: Keep in mind that some
plans will not require a premium or a deductible—but
you still need to compare total costs for the plan as a
whole to see which plan makes the most dollar sense.
While your premiums and deductible (if any) cannot
increase in the calendar year, your co-pays or co-insurance may. Such changes, though not expected to
happen frequently, can raise or lower your estimated
annual drug costs.
6. Types of Medicare Plans:
•

•

“Stand alone” plans that offer only drug coverage.
Such a plan may be for you if you wish to stay in
the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program for
other medical coverage.
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans that cover both
medical services and prescription drugs. Such a
plan may be for you if you can accept restrictions
on your choice of health care providers, and you
prefer managed care.

7. Call and Confirm Plan Information: Prior to enrolling
in any prescription drug plan, it’s important to call the
Prescription Drug Plan sponsor (or check their website) to confirm the information that you have gotten
from the Plan Finder. The plans are able to make
changes on a daily basis—and many have, as they try
to be more competitive with the plans they only saw
for the first time on November 15, 2005.
8. Changing Plans: Medicare beneficiaries who qualify
for Extra Help have the option of changing their prescription drug plan at any time. If you do not qualify
for Extra Help you can change your plan once between
now and May 16, 2006. Thereafter, changes can be
made during the annual enrollment period which is
typically November 15 to December 31 of each year.

Talk to the right person. If you have sent information
to Social Security to apply for Extra Help, they may call
you, but if the caller asks for your Social Security

By law, Medicare plans cannot come to your door to
sell their product, unless you have invited them. If you
experience this kind of activity, contact your state
attorney general. Look in the blue pages of your telephone directory for state government listings, then
look for “Attorney General.”
