Educational “Goodwill”: Measuring the Intangible Assets at Highly Selective Private Colleges

JEL No. I21
ABSTRACT
In this paper we utilize data on the head-to-head loss rate for students accepted at Williams College,
but who opt to enroll elsewhere. For example, we employ data that measure the fraction of students
admitted to Williams and to Amherst (or Harvard or Yale, etc.) but who opt to attend Amherst (or
Harvard or Yale, etc.) instead of Williams. We then model this head-to-head loss rate using data from
a variety of sources. A better understanding of the head-to-head loss rate can assist an institution in
the competition for high quality students. Importantly, it can also shed light on the degree to which
some part of the loss rate might be due to “intangible” differences between the schools being compared.
These intangibles (positive or negative) might grant a school greater success (or failure) in the market
for students than an objective accounting of its characteristics might suggest. Such an advantage (or
disadvantage) is closely aligned with the business concept of “goodwill.” We present preliminary
evidence on how a quantitative measure of educational goodwill can be computed.

I. Introduction
An empirical evaluation of the college admissions process requires the
consideration of a series of “decision points” facing both students and colleges. Students
must decide to apply to a particular school. That school, in turn, must decide whether the
student is accepted or not. The student must then decide whether or not to accept the
offer. Once admitted, the student must navigate several years of study to successfully
graduate. Nurnberg, Schapiro and Zimmerman (forthcoming) focused on the
matriculation decision, developing an empirical model that weighed the importance of a
variety of factors associated with whether an accepted student opted to attend Williams
College.1 In this paper, we shift the emphasis to learn more about the factors associated
with the loss of admitted students to other competing schools. That is, we utilize data on
the head-to-head loss rate for students accepted at Williams, but who opt to enroll
elsewhere. For example, we employ data that measure the fraction of students admitted
to Williams and to Amherst (or Harvard or Yale, etc.) but who opt to attend Amherst (or
Harvard or Yale, etc.) instead of Williams. We then model this head-to-head loss rate
using data from a variety of sources. A better understanding of the head-to-head loss rate
can assist an institution in the competition for high quality students. Importantly, it can
also shed light on the degree to which some part of the loss rate might be due to
“intangible” differences between the schools being compared. These intangibles
(positive or negative) might grant a school greater success (or failure) in the market for

students than an objective accounting of its characteristics might suggest. Such an
advantage (or disadvantage) is closely aligned with the business concept of “goodwill.”
BusinessDictionary.Com defines corporate goodwill as the:
assumed value of the attractive force that generates sales
revenue in a business, and adds value to its assets. Goodwill is
an intangible but saleable asset, almost indestructible except by
indiscretion. It is built painstakingly over the years generally
with (1) heavy and continuous expenditure in promotion, (2)
creation and maintenance of durable customer and supplier
relationships, (3) high quality of goods and services, and (4)
high quality and conduct of management and employees.
Goodwill includes the worth of corporate identity, and is
enhanced by corporate image and a proper location. Its value is
not recognized in account books but is realized when the
business is sold, and is reflected in the firm's selling price by the
amount in excess over the firm's net worth. In well established
firms, goodwill may be worth many times the worth of its
physical assets.2
If this concept is useful in the world of business, it seems reasonable to assume
that it is important for our most selective private colleges and universities as well. Have
some of these schools been more successful than others in promoting their names, in
building relationships with suppliers such as high schools, in developing alumni loyalty,
and in developing brand identity? Do they have intangible assets that make the
2

5
perception of their quality in excess of that indicated by, say, the accomplishments of
their faculty, the satisfaction of their students, and the financial success of their alumni?
Anecdotally, it seems that the goodwill concept is applicable to higher education. Any
high school guidance counselor can give you a list of schools that seem to be more than
the sum of their parts, and others that seem to be less. In other words, they can intuitively
name schools with lots of educational goodwill and those with little, none, or negative
amounts. We seek here to go beyond intuition and instead to show how a quantitative
measure of educational goodwill can be computed.
Our indicator of educational goodwill is based on “customer” behavior. When
prospective undergraduates are admitted to two schools, we observe their actual choices
and then compare them with the ones predicted by the relative strength of each school
based on “objective” criteria. The question isn’t whether a particular college or
university regularly does better in attracting students to its campus as opposed to an
alternative institution. The question is whether that school does better than it “should”
based on a range of indicators that are important to prospective students. Out of one
hundred students admitted to schools A and B who end up enrolling at one of those two,
seventy of them might matriculate at school A. That doesn’t necessarily indicate
anything about educational goodwill, since school A might have a much more
accomplished faculty, a better location, happier students, etc, than school B. But if
schools A and B were equivalent in all of those “objective” measures, then we would
expect that in the absence of educational goodwill, the yield would be 50-50. The
difference between an actual 70% yield against school B and a predicted 50% yield

6
indicates the presence of substantial goodwill at school A, with the opposite being the
case at school B.
While we present empirical results below, we are under no illusion that we have
come up with a definitive ranking of elite private colleges and universities in terms of
goodwill. The present data set is much too constraining for that. Instead, our goal is to
provide a framework for thinking about the value of an institution’s intangibles relative to
that of its peers. Our intention is simply to demonstrate how the theory presented here
can be applied.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents a more
detailed definition of educational; section III introduces and explains our illustrative
model; section IV presents our empirical results; section V concludes.

II. A Definition of Educational Goodwill
We conceive of educational in a relative sense – how do perspective students
value one college’s intangibles versus those of another one – and therefore we need to
select a benchmark institution. That institution will be assigned the arbitrary goodwill
value of zero and all competing institutions will be assigned values relative to the value
of that baseline institution. Williams College very generously gave us access to its
admissions data and is therefore used as the benchmark for this analysis. Thus, the
following analysis assigns a goodwill value of zero to Williams and then generates values
relative to Williams for each of Williams’ peer institutions.
To conceive of goodwill, we must first measure the value an institution provides
to its students based on objective criteria. More accurately, we must measure the value

7
an institution provides to its students relative to the value Williams provides to its
students. This means that we must capture the benefits students obtain while they are at
the school and the expected future job market and career enhancement benefits students
obtain after they graduate from the school. We formalize this approach with the
following mathematical framework.
Our analysis is driven by loss rates. In the framework laid out below, the loss rate
is calculated as follows:

# of Applicants admitted to Williams and
to School J who enroll at school J
# of Applicants admitted to Williams and to
School J who enroll at one of these schools

X 100

By aggregating individual matriculation decisions into Williams’ aggregate loss rate, we
can construct a meaningful way of thinking about the overall relative attractiveness of
different institutions. The higher the loss rate, the more desirable that school is relative to
Williams. Our challenge is to decompose this aggregation of attractiveness into its
component parts – those that come from objective criteria and those that come from
intangibles.
The following figure displays the range of Williams’ loss rates to its primary
competitors (based on a data set explained below) for students who apply for regular
admission (as opposed to those who apply to a single school under an early admission
agreement):

While it may be interesting to note that Princeton wins 90% of prospective
undergraduates in its competition with Williams while Cornell wins only 12%, those
numbers tell us nothing about which of these schools has more educational goodwill. In
order to address that question, we specify the loss rate as a function of two types of
factors influencing the matriculation decision: differences in the perceived quality of the
services provided by institutions and the value of educational goodwill. In a more formal
framework, this implies that:

L jw   ( X j  X w )   jw
with L jw  [0,100]

(1)

Here, Ljw is the loss rate of Williams to school j, and Xj and Xw are respectively vectors of
college quality variables for institution j and Williams. Ljw takes on values between 0 and
100%, although, as explained below, we chose not to limit the predicted loss rates to

9
those bounds. The variables in the X vectors measure the perceived quality of different
institutional aspects related to the objective characteristics of those institutions. β is a
vector of coefficients. Under this framework, εjw captures two things: the institutional
characteristics related to those benefits that we did not include in the X vectors, plus the
benefits derived from intangibles. Thus, the better job we do of including the value of all
institutional characteristics, the closer εjw comes to measuring the educational goodwill of
school j relative to that of Williams. In this framework, the goodwill of an institution is
Williams’ actual loss rate to that school minus a predicted loss rate that is based on the
value of objective measures, a metric measured in percentage points.

III. An Illustrative Model
We restrict our illustrative analysis to a relatively large but not exhaustive group
of Williams’ peer institutions constructed from self-reported student information reported
to Williams via the Admitted Student Questionnaire (ASQ). Students who matriculated
at Williams were asked for the list of other schools that admitted them; students who
were admitted to Williams but went elsewhere were asked the name of the school where
the student enrolled. This is far from a perfect measure of loss rates given that they are
self-reported. Ideally, unit record data would be used that contain actual application,
admission and matriculation information but that would require permission from a range
of schools which we have thus far been unable to gain. We then use a 75% random
sample of the ASQ data reported to Williams for three recent classes. Per our
confidentiality agreement with Williams, we do not know which specific years are
represented in our data set. We selected our universe of peer institutions by using those

10
schools that are among the thirty-one members of the Consortium on the Financing of
Higher Education (COFHE) while adding the two additional schools, Bowdoin and
Middlebury, which were selected over Williams by at least five students according to our
sample of ASQ data. Due to data availability problems, we were forced to remove six
COFHE schools from our sample: Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Johns Hopkins, Trinity,
Rochester, and Washington University in St. Louis, ending up with a set of twenty-six
privates colleges and universities in addition to Williams.3
The variables in this analysis are intended to capture objective institutional
measures. These college characteristics break down into three categories: institutional
inputs, reported student satisfaction, and perceived investment benefits. Institutional
inputs act as a proxy for the quality of the educational product provided by different
institutions. In theory, increased inputs per student should improve the quality of the
education provided by a given institution, with additional inputs translating into enhanced
classroom and extracurricular experiences. However, a complication is that some of the
institutions in our data set are undergraduate colleges with few or no graduate students
while others are research universities with large numbers of graduate and professional
school students. Simply dividing institutional expenditures by the total number of
students implies that institutions distribute resources evenly between graduate students
and undergraduates, an assumption that is at odds with the literature. Instead, we apply a
disproportionate weight to graduate students in our measure of inputs per student,

In alphabetical order, the schools in our sample are Amherst, Bowdoin, Brown, Carleton, Columbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Georgetown, Harvard, Middlebury, MIT, Mount Holyoke, Northwestern,
Oberlin, Pomona, Princeton, Rice, Smith, Stanford, Swarthmore, University of Chicago, University of
Pennsylvania, Wellesley, Wesleyan, and Yale.

11
assuming that each graduate student equals, from a resource use standpoint, 1.5
undergraduate students.4
Student satisfaction variables likely indicate the consumption value of different
institutions while variables measuring perceived investment benefits are aimed at
capturing the job market advantages provided by different institutions.
Endowment per student (weighted as described above) is a typical measure of
institutional wealth that presumably is used to enhance undergraduate education broadly
defined – paying high salaries to attract and retain high-quality professors, providing
generous financial aid used to maximize peer effects from highly talented students,
decreasing class sizes, building state of the art facilities, etc. We also include measures
of student satisfaction with the academic environment on campus, with the quality of the
night life and with the weather. Endowment data (Appendix 1) come from the National
Association of College and University Business Officers 2007 endowment study while
student satisfaction data come from the popular (among college applicants) College
Prowler website (Appendix 2). College Prowler claims to have “the only college guides
written by college students for college students.”5 While other sources provide similar
rankings based on student feedback, College Prowler is one of the best known and most
commonly used. The site ranks a variety of school attributes on a letter based grade scale
from A+ through F, but the small sample size in this analysis and the collinearity among
these measures led us to focus on just three of them that intuitively are expected to matter
4

As the weight assigned to graduate students increases (say from 1.5 to 2 undergraduates per graduate
student), research universities in our sample appear to be poorer financially relative to their college
counterparts. Our empirical analysis therefore attributes more of the admissions performance at
universities to educational goodwill as opposed to their objective characteristics. Hence, the more heavily
we weigh graduate enrollment, the higher universities rank on the list of educational goodwill presented in
Table 2.

12
to teenagers selecting colleges. We convert their letter grades into numbers from a value
of thirteen for an A+ to one for an F. We expect that students would be attracted, all else
equal, to colleges and universities with greater student satisfaction (relative to Williams)
with the academic environment, with the night life on campus and with the weather.
Finally, we use starting salary data from PayScale.com’s College Salary Report
(Appendix 3) to measure the perceived investment benefits associated with different
institutions. This variable measures the average earnings of an institution’s graduates one
year out of college, and presumably indicates the earnings a student might expect if he or
she matriculated at a particular school. Of course there are a wide range of problems
with linking this crude measure to the income prospects any individual student might
reasonably expect. It ignores the variance in earnings and the relationship between a
particular course of study with earnings. And it ignores the selection biases that plague
the earnings literature – simply put, more able students tend to pursue more advanced
levels of education at more selective schools and it is very difficult to determine whether
observed wage gaps are due to inherent differences in student ability and motivation or to
differences in the value added provided by one institution as opposed to another.
Fortunately, our concern here is not to analyze the contribution of schools to lifetime
earnings. We don’t care about the actual return to education, only about the return
perceived by college applicants at the time of their matriculation decisions. It seems
unreasonable to expect even the most precocious college applicant to be familiar with the
econometrics literature on the return to human capital investments. If prospective
students look at the starting salary data and use this information in selecting schools, it
doesn’t particularly matter to us if the numbers are good or bad indicators of economic

13
returns. The higher the value of this measure relative to Williams, the more attractive an
institution is expected to be, thereby raising the Williams loss rate.
As stated in the introduction, we make no claim about creating a definitive
ranking of educational goodwill. We readily acknowledge that this empirical framework
is plagued by response bias in the ASQ data, the arbitrary nature of the weighting used to
standardize the wealth measure across schools, the use of Williams as the sole reference
school, limitations in the extent to which our proxy variables capture components of
institutional attractiveness, and numerous other problems, some of which come with a
small sample size. The analysis presented here is provided for illustrative purposes,
giving a concrete example of how the theory we presented above can be applied. Thus,
the actual numbers presented below are less important than the conceptual theory they
illustrate.

IV. Empirical Analysis
We conduct our analysis by fitting the variables discussed in section III into the
framework summarized by equation (1). We use the following model specification,
breaking down the X vector into five components.

Ljw = β0 + β1(Endowmentj – Endowmentw) + β2(Academicsj – Academicsw) + β3(Night
Lifej – Night Lifew)+ β4(Weatherj – Weatherw) + β5(StartSalaryj – StartSalaryw) +
εjw

The estimation results are as follows:

While the student satisfaction measures are statistically insignificant, the other
two variables are significant at the 1% level and this simple model explains 80% of the
variation in loss rates between Williams and the other schools in the sample. Recall that
the reported variables are the difference between the value for a given institution and the
value for Williams. We divided the endowment per capita variable by 100,000 and the
starting salary variable by 1,000 to facilitate the interpretation of the results. Thus, the
coefficients on those variables respectively indicate the change in Williams’ loss rate to a
given institution when the difference between the institution’s endowment per capita
(weighted as described above) and Williams’ endowment per capita rises by $100,000 or
the difference between the starting salaries of a school’s alumni and the starting salaries
of Williams’ alumni increases by $1,000. Therefore, a $100,000 increase in weighted

15
endowment per student between another school and Williams increases the Williams loss
rate to that school by almost two and a half percentage points while every $1,000 addition
in starting salary at a rival school relative to Williams leads to an increase in the Williams
loss rate to that school by around a percentage point and a half.
As discussed above, we compute educational goodwill by solving for the
residual. Unfortunately, it is likely that the error term includes the impact of both
intangibles and of those relevant institutional characteristics that are not captured by the
variables in the model. But for illustrative purposes, we assume that educational
goodwill comprises the entire residual – the actual loss rate minus the loss rate predicted
in the model. The predicted loss rates are displayed in Figure 2 while the differences
between the actual and predicted values are shown in Figure 3. Recall that all of these
measures of goodwill are calculated relative to the goodwill at Williams College, and
therefore the value for Williams is zero.

Upon first inspection, it might seem problematic that three of these predicted loss rates
are negative. While it is possible for 100% of the students who are admitted to both
Wesleyan and Williams and end up matriculating at one of those two schools to go to
Williams, it isn’t possible for 106% of those students to go to Williams. However, by
allowing predicted loss rates less than zero, we are better able to distinguish among
schools at the very low end of the yield range against Williams. While according to this
model, several schools should have very low predicted yields relative to Williams (with
Smith at 5% and Carleton at 3%), the fact that Mount Holyoke has a predicted value of
-1%, Oberlin is at -2% and Wesleyan is at -6% indicates that based on the institutional
characteristics included in this model, those schools should do even worse against

17
Williams than Carleton should. If we constrained all predicted values to the zero to 100
interval, that distinction would be largely lost.

difference between the actual and predicted loss rates.

The key insight from this analysis is that some schools do considerably better
against Williams in the competition for undergraduate students than the schools’
fundamental characteristics (or at least those captured in the model) suggest that they
should. Others do much worse. The order of this list deserves some comment. Why, for
example, is Wellesley, a school to which Williams has only a 17% loss rate, ranked

19
above MIT, a school to which Williams has a 75% loss rate? The reason is simple. The
model suggests that based on objective criteria, Williams “should” have a 14% loss rate
to Wellesley and an 80% loss rate to MIT. Hence, Williams does better than it “should”
against MIT (the actual loss rate minus the predicted one is negative five percentage
points) and worse than it “should” against Wellesley (the actual loss rate minus the
predicted one is positive three percentage points). So Wellesley is ranked above
Williams in educational goodwill (#12 versus #13) while MIT at #17 is below.
This analysis does not seek to provide any insights into the sources generating
educational goodwill. However, despite our caveat about not putting much stock into our
particular empirical results, an obvious observation is that six of the eight members of the
Ivy League do even better than expected in this analysis, with Brown topping our list of
educational goodwill and Columbia, Yale, Harvard and Penn right behind. Perhaps the
Ivy label provides some brand value that generates a competitive admissions advantage
over and above that attributable to the objective characteristics of those schools. That
intuitive hypothesis needs to be tested within a more rigorous empirical analysis.

V. Conclusion
The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework to introduce the idea of
educational goodwill. By accounting for a school’s undergraduate attractiveness based
on its objective characteristics, and then comparing actual yields against expected ones,
we have attempted to tease out the presence of intangibles. If businesses can be worth
more or less than the sum of their parts, so may colleges and universities. Returning to
