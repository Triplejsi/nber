Estimators for Persistent and Possibly Non-Stationary Data with Classical Properties

ABSTRACT
This paper considers a moments based non-linear estimator that is root-T consistent and uniformly
asymptotically normal irrespective of the degree of persistence of the forcing process. These properties
hold for linear autoregressive models, linear predictive regressions, as well as certain non-linear dynamic
models. Asymptotic normality is obtained because the moments are chosen so that the objective function
is uniformly bounded in probability and that a central limit theorem can be applied.
Critical values from the normal distribution can be used irrespective of the treatment of the deterministic
terms. Simulations show that the estimates are precise, and the t-test has good size in the parameter
region where the least squares estimates usually yield distorted inference.

Introduction

This paper considers a quasi-differencing (QD) framework that can yield

√

T consistent and uni-

formly asymptotically normal estimators of autoregressions and multiple regressions when the predictors are persistent and possibly non-stationary. The approach can also be used to estimate
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The critical values are invariant to the
presence of deterministic trends.
Let θ be an unknown parameter vector and let θ0 be its true value. We propose non-linear QD
estimators that can generically be defined as
θbK = argmin g(θ)0 WT g(θ),

(1)

θ∈Θ

where g(θ) is a K ×1 vector of moments, WT is a K ×K positive-definite matrix, and Θ is a bounded
set containing values of θ.1 The basic premise of QD estimation is that for θbK to have classical
properties, g(θ) needs to be uniformly bounded in probability and that a central limit theorem can
be applied. To this end, g(θ) is defined as the difference between the normalized autocovariances of
the variables in the model and the data, all quasi-differenced at a persistence parameter that is to
be estimated jointly with other parameters of the model. The normalization and quasi-differencing
together provide a non-linear transformation of the autocovariances to result in estimators that are
robust to possible non-stationarity in the data.
Achieving asymptotic normality without knowing when the exogenous process has an autoregressive
unit root can be very useful in applied work because the answers to many macroeconomic questions
are sensitive to assumptions about the nature of the trend and to whether the corresponding
regressions are estimated in levels or in first-differences. The price to pay for practical simplicity
√
and robustness is that the proposed estimators are T consistent rather than super-consistent
when the regressors are truly non-stationary. While other asymptotically normal estimators robust
to non-stationary regressors are available, they apply only to specific linear models. The QD
estimation framework is general and can be used whenever the variables can be quasi-differenced
in the way discussed below.
We establish uniform asymptotic normality of QD-based estimators in many different settings.

The optimization is performed over an expanded neighborhood of the set of admissible values of θ so that the
parameter of interest is not on the boundary of the support. For the AR(1) model, the admissible values are (−1+δ, 1]
where δ > 0. We optimize over Θ = [C1 , C2 ], where C1 < −1 + δ < 1 < C2 . When the context is clear, Θ will not be
explicitly specified.

Throughout, we use the notion of uniformity given in Mikusheva (2007a), who studied uniform
coverage properties of various inference procedures for the AR(1) model.

In our analysis, Fθ (x) is in the family of Gaussian distributions.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a rigorous analysis of the AR(1) model.
Section 3 extends the analysis to AR(p) models, while Section 4 studies predictive regressions.
Section 5 considers non-linear estimation of structural parameters. Simulations are presented in
√
Section 6. The relation of QD estimation to other T -consistent estimators is discussed in Section
7. All proofs are in the Appendix. As a matter of notation, the indicator function I(a) is one if a
is true and zero otherwise. We let W (·) be the standard Brownian motion and use ⇒ to denote
weak convergence.

The AR(1) Model

To systematically motivate the idea behind QD estimation, we begin with the simple AR(1) model
with parameter α and whose true value is α0 . For t = 1, . . . , T , the data are generated by
yt = α0 yt−1 + εt , y0 = 0.

(2)

Hereafter, we let εt be the deviation between the dependent variable and the conditional mean
evaluated at the true parameter value, while et is the deviation evaluated at an arbitrary value of
the parameter vector. The error εt does not need to be iid or Gaussian, but it cannot be conditional
heteroscedastic or heteroscedastic.

Assumption A (εt , Ft ) is a stationary ergodic martingale-difference sequence with conditional
variance E(ε2t |Ft−1 ) = σ 2 = γ0 and E((ε2t − σ 2 )2 |Ft−1 ) = µ4 .

The least squares estimator α
bOLS is defined as the solution to g(α) = 0, where g(α) =

is the sample analog of the moment condition
Egt (α0 ) = E[εt yt−1 ] = 0,

bOLS is

bOLS is super-consistent at

α0

√

T consistent and asymptotically normal. While

= 1, its distribution is non-standard which makes inference difficult.

In particular, the t-statistic for testing α0 = 1 is non-normal in finite samples and converges to
the so-called Dickey-Fuller distribution. The issue of non-standard inference arises because of two
problems. First, when α0 = 1, the sample moment evaluated at a value α 6= α0 = 1 explodes, and
second, the normalized sample moment evaluated at the true value does not obey a central limit

theorem. Specifically, g(α) = T1 Tt=1 et yt−1 is stochastically unbounded, and T1 Tt=1 εt yt−1 ⇒
R1
σ 2 0 W (r)dW (r), where W (r) is the standard Brownian motion.
Our starting point is to resolve the second issue by exploiting the autocovariance structure of the
errors. Specifically, for j ≥ 1, it holds that
E(εt εt−j ) = 0.

(3)

Furthermore, for all |α0 | ≤ 1 and εt = yt − α0 yt−1 , the population moment condition has a sample
analog that obeys a central limit theorem:

Obviously, α0 is unknown and εt is not observed. However, we can quasi-difference yt at some
α and then optimize over all possible values of α by matching the sample autocovariances of the
quasi-differenced data2

with those of the model evaluated under the assumption that α is the true value. Precisely, the
model implied moments are
γj (α) = Eα et et−j = I(j = 0)σ 2 ,
where Eα is the expectation taken under the (not necessarily correct) assumption that α is the
true value. In cases when γj (α) is constant, the dependence of γj on α can be suppressed. For
2

To be more precise, we should write γ
bj (α, α0 , σ 2 ) because the data are generated under α0 and σ 2 , and we
quasi-difference the data at α. For notational simplicity, the dependence of γ
bj on α0 and σ 2 are suppressed.

3

example, in the AR(1) under consideration, γj (α) = 0 for all j ≥ 1, and we may write γj instead
of γj (α). This is also true of the AR(p) and predictive regressions considered in the sections 3 and
4. However, in more complex models such as the one considered in Section 5, γj often depends on
α in a complicated and analytically intractable way. For clarity, we keep the explicit dependence
of γj on α throughout.
Let g N QD (α) = (g 0,N QD (α), . . . , g K,N QD (α))0 , where
g j,N QD (α) = γ
bj (α) − γj (α),
be the difference between the model-implied and the sample autocovariance of et . The estimator
is defined as
α
bK,N QD = argmin g N QD (α)0 WT g N QD (α).

Although α
bK,N QD is a standard GMM estimator, viewing it from the perspective of a covariance
structure estimator helps understand the analysis to follow. In standard covariance structure

estimation where a typical element of g(α) is g j (α) = T1 Tt=1 yt yt−1 − Eα yt yt−1 , each sample

In our g j,N QD (α), both the sample and model moments depend on α. It differs from the standard

P
formulation of covariance structure estimation but it is necessary because T ( T1 Tt=1 yt yt−1 −
Eα yt yt−1 ) does not obey a central limit theorem at α = α0 = 1.
The NQD solves one of the two problems inherent in least squares estimation by making

√

T g j,N QD (α0 )

asymptotically normal for all |α0 | ≤ 1. However, the estimator still has non-standard properties
because γ
bj (α) is stochastically unbounded when α0 = 1 and α 6= 1. Thus the moment g j,N QD (α)
explodes at α 6= α0 when α0 is unity or in the neighborhood of one. To resolve this problem,
suppose γ0 is known and define

As shown in Lemma A-2 of the Appendix, γ
bj (α) − γ
b0 (α) is bounded in probability in the limit even
when α0 = 1 and α 6= α0 . Because g j,F QD (α) is uniformly bounded in probability for all values
over which α is optimized and α0 ∈ (1 − δ, 1], the FQD has very different properties from the NQD
in the local-to-unity framework.
To gain insight about the importance of normalization, we let WT be an identity matrix as it does
not affect uniformity arguments and this simplifying assumption makes it possible to obtain useful
closed form expressions.

Proposition 1 Let yt be generated as in equation (2) with error terms satisfying Assumption A.

The NQD estimator is the basis of the estimators we subsequently investigate. It is consistent
and has a data dependent convergence rate. Since the objective function is a polynomial of the
fourth order, there are multiple solutions. If the realization of data is such that there is a unique
minimum to the optimization problem, the convergence rate is T . If there are two minima, a slower
convergence rate of T 3/4 is obtained. In either case, the distribution of α
bK,N QD is not asymptotically normal because g N QD (α) is not well behaved for all values of α0 . However, the problematic
term that frustrates a quadratic expansion of γ
bj (α) around α0 is asymptotically collinear with the
corresponding term in γ
b0 (α) in the local-to-unity framework. Normalizing each γ
bj (α) by γ
b0 (α) and

.

γj (α) by γ0 results in an FQD estimator whose asymptotic distribution is normal uniformly over
α0 ∈ (−1 + δ, 1]. When K > 1, the FQD objective function has only one minimum asymptotically.3
The properties for α
bK,F QD are stated assuming the true value of σ 2 is known. The reason why
γ0 = σ 2 is not freely estimated along with α is that doing so would yield multiple solutions. The
objective function is zero not only at the true solution α = α0 , σ 2 = γ0 , but also at α = 1/α0 , σ 2 =
γ0 /(α0 )2 . Without additional information, the FQD cannot uniquely identify α and σ 2 .
In practice, the true value of σ 2 is not known, and the FQD estimator is infeasible. This can be
overcome by finding another moment that can identify σ 2 . Let θ = (α, σ 2 ) and consider



and M = IT − z(z 0 z)−1 z 0 is the matrix that projects onto the space orthogonal

to z with zt = yt−1 . Observe that the first component of g QD (θ) is s2 −σ 2 or equivalently s2 −γ0 (α),
but not s2 − γ
b0 (α). Thus, g QD (θ) is not a linear transformation of g N QD (θ). Using s2 − γ

When the NQD has two local minima, it does not matter which one is chosen as they are asymptotically symmetric

estimators. Instead, the estimator is more efficient than α
bK,F QD that has a known σ 2 . Pierce (1982)
showed in a framework for stationary data that using estimated values of nuisance parameters can
yield statistics with smaller variance than if the nuisance parameters were known. This somewhat
paradoxical result was also reported by Prokhorov and Schmidt (2009) and Han and Kim (2011)
for GMM estimators. Our results suggest that this feature may also arise in the local-to-unity
framework.
The closed form expression for the asymptotic variance of α
bK,QD in Proposition 2 was obtained
under the assumption that WT is an identity matrix. For an arbitrary positive-definite weighting
matrix, the asymptotic variance of α
bK,QD is the (1,1)-th element of asymptotic variance matrix
Avar(θbK,QD ) = (G00 W G0 )−1 G00 W S 0 W G0 (G00 W G0 )−1

(8)

where W, G0 and S 0 are the probability limits of WT , the derivative of g QD (θ) with respect to θ
evaluated at θ0 , and the asymptotic variance of g QD (θ0 ), respectively. The asymptotic variance
can thus be estimated as though the GMM estimator were developed in the stationary framework
under regularity conditions such as those given in Newey and McFadden (1994). In theory, more
efficient estimates can be obtained if WT is an optimal weighting matrix. However, it has been
documented in Abowd and Card (1989) and Altonji and Segal (1996) that an optimal weighting
matrix may not be desirable for covariance structure estimation for empirically relevant sample
sizes.
The key to the classical properties of α
bK,QD is the ability to exploit the autocovariance properties
of the quasi-differenced data in an appropriate way. Quasi-differencing has a long tradition in
econometrics and underlies GLS estimation, see Phillips and Xiao (1998). Canjels and Watson
(1997) and Phillips and Lee (1996) found that quasi-differencing gives more precise estimates of
trend parameters when the errors are highly persistent. Pesavento and Rossi (2006) suggest that
for such data, quasi-differencing can improve the coverage of impulse response functions. In both
studies, the data are quasi-differenced at α = α which is fixed at the value suggested by the localto-unity framework. In contrast, the FQD and QD simultaneously estimate this parameter and
use the normalized autocovariances of the quasi-differenced data for estimation. Notably, both the
FQD and the QD have classical properties that hold even in the presence of deterministic terms.
Consider data generated as
yt = dt + xt ,

xt = α0 xt−1 + εt .

The deterministic terms are captured by dt =

where r is the order of the deterministic

trend function. In the intercept-only case, dt = ψ0 , and in the linear trend case, dt = ψ0 + ψ1 t.
Once the parameters of the trend function are consistently estimated, QD estimation proceeds by
replacing yt with demeaned or de-trended data, x
bt = yt − dbt . Let ebt = x

Demeaning and de-trending do not affect the asymptotic distribution of the QD.4
The practical appeal of QD estimation is that asymptotic normality permits standard inference.
The usual critical values of ±1.96 and ±1.64 can be used for two-tailed tests at the 5 and 10 percent
significance levels, respectively. We will see in simulations that the size of tests and the coverage
of the confidence sets based on the asymptotic normality of α
bK,QD are stable over the parameter
set α0 ∈ (−1 + δ, 1]. The cost of imposing the stronger assumption of conditional homoscedasticity
seems well justified.
To recapitulate, the proposed QD estimation of the AR(1) model is based on two simple premises:
first, that for all j ≥ 1, E(εt εt−j ) = 0 and its sample analog obeys a central limit theorem, and,
second, that the objective function is uniformly bounded in probability for all values of α and α0 .
The idea can be used whenever the variables can be quasi-differenced to form suitably normalized
moment conditions that satisfy these two properties. The next two sections consider the AR(p)
model and predictive regressions, respectively. We then show that the quasi-differenced variables
can be serially correlated and that the QD framework can be used in non-linear estimations.

Predictive Regressions

Consider the predictive regression with scalar predictor xt−1 :
yt = β 0 xt−1 + εyt

(14a)

xt = α0 xt−1 + εxt .

(14b)

If α0 = 1, then (1; −β 0 ) is a co-integrating vector, and ordinary least squares provide superconsistent estimates but inference is non-standard. Unfortunately, the finite sample distribution of
βbOLS is not well approximated by the normal distribution if xt is highly persistent. The challenge is

As in the case of autoregressions, the FQD moments alone cannot globally identify both θ and Ω.
Thus, the properties of θbK,F QD are stated by evaluating Ω at the true value of Ω0 . Proposition 4
shows that θbK,QD has classical properties both in the stationary and the local-to-unity framework
and is more efficient than the estimator θbK,F QD that uses the known Ω. The QD can be implemented
as a sequential estimator in which the covariance matrix is computed for shocks obtained from two
least squares regressions: one by regressing yt on xt to get ebyt , and another autoregression in xt to
obtain ebxt .
Proposition 4 has useful implications for applied work because there does not exist an estimator
that is robust to the persistent properties of the predictors. The approach of Jansson and Moreira
(2006) relies on model-specific conditional critical values and, in any event, their inference procedure
does not yield an estimator per se. In contrast, the QD estimator is simple and robust.
The predictive regression can be generalized to accommodate stationary and pre-determined regressors, zt . Suppose the data generating process is

as lags of ∆yt and ∆xt can be added to zt to control for residual serial correlation.

Non-Linear Models and Minimum Distance Estimation

So far, the QD framework has been used to estimate linear models, where the model autocovariances
are such that γj (θ) = 0 for all θ assumed to be the true value and j ≥ 1. The analysis also holds if
γj (θ) equals a constant vector other than zero provided that the constant vector is known or can be
computed numerically. For example, if xt is an ARMA(1,1) instead of an AR(1), γj (θ) will depend
on the parameters of the model. Another example is DSGE models which we now consider.
To fix ideas, consider the simple one sector stochastic growth model presented in Uhlig (1999). Let
Qt , Ct , Kt , It be output, consumption, capital stock, and investment, respectively. The problem
P
−t log C subject to the

constraints Qt = Kt−1
Zt1−ψ = Ct + It and Kt = (1 − δ)Kt−1 + It where ut = log Zt evolves as

ut = αut−1 + εt ,

εt ∼ (0, σ 2 ).

Denote the deviation of a variable from its mean by lower case letters. Let Yt = (y1t , . . . , yN t )0 be
the collection of endogenous variables in the model (such as consumption, output, etc.). As shown
in Uhlig (1999), this simple model has an analytic solution:
kt = vkk kt−1 + vkz ut
where vkk < 1 does not depend on α, but vkz depends on α. For each ynt ∈ Yt ,
(1 − vkk L)(1 − αL)ynt = ut + ϑn ut−1
is an ARMA(2,1) with a moving-average parameter ϑn that is a function of the structural parameters. Note that all series in Yt have the same autoregressive dynamics as kt . The parameters of the linearized solution are β = (vkk , vkz , ϑ1 , . . . , ϑN ). The parameters of the model are
θ = (ψ, α, σ 2 , ρ, δ). Let Θ be a compact set containing possible values of θ.
In analysis of DSGE models, whether the shocks have permanent or transitory effects matter for
how a model is to be linearized. For this reasons, researchers typically need to decide whether to
difference the data ahead of estimation even though it is understood that the assumption affects
the estimates and policy analysis. To date, there does not exist an estimator of DSGE models that
14

has classical properties for all values of α within the likelihood framework because the likelihood
function is not well defined when the data are non-stationary.6
We propose to estimate the parameters of the model without making a priori assumptions about
the degree of persistence of the shocks. We use the fact that the features of covariance stationary processes are completely summarized by their second moments. Conveniently, the software
DYNARE automatically calculates the covariance structure of the data. Even though the analysis
is not likelihood based, priors can still be incorporated using the approach of Chernozhukov and
Hong (2003).7 The key is to construct the moments g(θ) appropriately.
Two variations of the QD framework are considered. The first method proceeds as follows. For given
θ, let et = Yt −αYt−1 with Γj (θ) = E(et e0t ). Define the moment ωj (θ) = (Γj (θ)−Γ0 (θ)) whose sample
b j (θ) − Γ
b 0 (θ)). Note that since et (θ) can be serially correlated, Γj (θ) need not be
analog is ω
bj (θ) = (Γ
a null matrix as in the applications considered thus far. Let g QD (θ) = (g 1,QD (θ)0 , . . . , g K,QD (θ)0 )0
where g j,QD (θ) = vec(b
ωj (θ) − ωj (θ)). The QD estimator considered in Gorodnichenko and Ng
(2010) is defined as8
θbK,QD = argmin g QD (θ)0 g QD (θ).

(15)

θ∈Θ

As written, θbK,QD is an equally weighted estimator. An optimal weighting matrix can be used
subject to constraints imposed by stochastic singularity. In the one-shock stochastic growth model
considered, the autocovariance at lag one of both output and consumption can both be used to
construct an efficient θbK,QD , but additional autocovariances will not add independent information.
In contrast, the use of data for both output and consumption in likelihood estimation would not
even be possible.
Another QD-based estimator can be obtained if we entertain the possibility of a reduced form
model. Consider a finite order AR(p) model:

yt = a yt−1 +

b0j ∆yt−j + εtp

where β 0 = (a0 , b01 , .., b0p−1 ) = β(θ0 ) are the true ‘reduced-form’ parameters that can be computed
analytically or numerically. We also need the following:

Likelihood estimation is also problematic when there are more variables than shocks, a problem known as stochastic singularity.

Identification requires rank j,QD

to expectation equations. Formal identification conditions are given in Komunjer and Ng (2011).

β(θ) is twice continuously differentiable; (iii) B(θ0 ) = ∇β(θ0 ) has full rank k = dim(θ) ≤ p.

The method proceeds as follows. For ynt ∈ Yt , define ent (β) = ynt − aynt−1 −

Pp−1

j=1 bj ynt−j

where

β = (a, b1 , . . . , bp−1 ). Note that Yt is now quasi-differenced using the ‘reduced-form’ parameter
β instead of the structural parameter α as in method 1. Once the data are quasi-differenced,
bj (θ; p) − ωj (θ; p)
estimation proceeds by defining ωj (θ; p) = (Γj (θ; p) − Γ0 (θ; p)) with g j,QD (θ; p) = ω
and sample analog as in (15). Let g QD (θ; p) = (g 1,QD (θ; p)0 , . . . , g K,QD (θ; p)0 )0 . The estimator is
θbK,QD = argmin g QD (θ; p)0 g QD (θ; p).

(17)

θ∈Θ

Because β is p-dimensional, this second estimator also depends on the choice of p. Since ent is
not necessarily exactly white noise, Γj (θ) will not be zero. However, its autocovariances can be
computed for any given θ.
We have presented two uses of the QD framework that can yield estimators that are robust to
non-stationary exogenous variables in DSGE models. The data-dependent transformations allow
us to construct moments that are uniformly bounded. Applying the central limit theorem to the
sample moments yields estimators with classical properties.

Simulations

We consider the finite sample properties of OLS, FQD with γ0 fixed at the true σ02 , and QD. Even
though the FQD estimator is infeasible in practice, it is a useful benchmark. The simulations are
based on 2,000 replications. We use the standard Newey-West plug-in estimator for the variance
of the moments. As starting values, we use 0.9 times the true values of the parameters. The QD
estimator requires evaluation of the model implied autocovariances Γj (θ). This is straightforward
once a model is cast in a state space. For example, the system

More generally, every ARMA model has a state-space representation from which a state-space
model for the quasi-differenced data can be expressed as
wt = D0 wt−1 + D1 εt
where wt includes et (θ) (and possibly its lags), and εt is the set of exogenous white noise shocks with
variance Ωε . The variance matrix Ωw (0) = E(wt wt0 ) can be computed by iterating the equation
(i−1)
Ω(i)
(0)D00 + D1 Ωε D10
w (0) = D0 Ωw

(18)

until convergence. The autocovariance matrices can then be computed as Ωw (j) = D0j Ωw (0). Now
Γj (θ) are submatrices of Ωw (j). If we are only interested in computing the moments wtd ⊂ wt , we
(i)

(i−1)

iterate equation (18) until the block that corresponds to wtd converges, i.e. kΩwd (0)−Ωwd (0)k < c.
Data are generated from the AR(2) model:
(1 − λ01 L)(1 − λ02 L)yt = εt ,

εt ∼ N (0, 1).

The process can be written as
yt = α0 yt−1 + b0 ∆yt−1 + εt .
The parameter of interest is α0 = λ01 + λ02 − λ01 λ02 with b0 = λ01 λ02 . The OLS estimate of α has a
non-standard distribution when the roots are unity, in which case α0 = 1.
We estimate an AR(2) model when λ02 = 0 (Table 1). Demeaned data are used to compute the
sample autocovariances in the intercept case, and linearly de-trended data are used in the linear
trend case. We report the mean of the QD, FQD, and OLS estimates when T = 200 and 500,
the J test for over-identifying restrictions, along with the finite sample power for one-sided t tests
evaluated at α = α0 − 0.05.
Table 1 shows that all three estimators are precise when α0 ≤ 0.8. The t-statistic for the null
hypothesis that α = α0 for all three estimators has rejection rates close to the nominal size of 0.05
when α0 ≤ 0.8. The picture is, however, very different at larger values of α0 . The FQD has slightly
smaller bias but is much less efficient. While OLS has the largest bias, its root-mean-squared error
(RMSE) is much smaller than the FQD. The QD is neither the most accurate nor the most efficient,
but has RMSE closer to OLS and much smaller than the FQD, in support of Proposition 2.
Efficiency of OLS comes at the cost of size distortion, however. At T = 200, the OLS-based tstatistic has a rejection rate of 0.473 when α0 = 1 and 0.15 when α0 = 0.95, much larger than
17

the nominal size of 0.05. Even at T = 500, the rejection rates are 0.462 and 0.127, well above the
nominal rate of 5%. The rejection rates for the FQD and QD are 0.107 and 0.08 when T = 200,
and are 0.066 and 0.076 when T = 500, much closer to the nominal size of 0.05. The QD has
accurate rejection rates that are always around 0.05 for all values of α0 , but it has less power than
OLS. Figure 1 plots the distribution of t-statistics for QD at T =200 and T =500. The normal
approximation to the finite sample distribution is good.
We report results for over-parameterized AR(p) models in Table 2. In particular, we estimate an
AR(3) when the true model is an AR(2). We fix λ02 to 0.2 and set λ01 such that the sum of the
AR(2) parameters is the same as in Table 1. Statistics are reported for α
b. The results are similar
to Table 1: the FQD is inefficient; the t statistic associated with it has good size but lower power.
The OLS has large size distortion when α0 is close to one, but the estimates are tightly estimated.
The QD strikes a balance between the two, and the t statistic has very similar size property for all
values of |α0 (1)| ≤ 1 even when T = 200 in the intercept case. In the linear time trend case, the
uniform size property can be achieved with T = 500. Importantly, the QD achieves a more accurate
size when α0 is close to unity without sacrificing too much power outside of the persistent range.
For example, when α0 is 0.5, the power of OLS and QD are quite similar. The reason is that when
√
α0 is far from the unit circle, OLS is T consistent, but so is FQD and QD. Power is also fairly
similar for both the intercept only and the linear trend model.
Table 3 presents results for predictive regressions. Data for the predictive regressions are generated
0 = 1, σ 0 = 1, σ 0 = 0.5. The results are generally
as in (14a) and (14b). We let β 0 = 1, σyy
xx
yx

similar to the AR(p) case. The QD is slightly less efficient than OLS when α0 is close to one but no
less efficient when α0 is far from the unit circle. This loss of efficiency arises from the fact that at
√
α0 = 1, OLS is T consistent but the QD is only T consistent. The benefit to this small efficiency
loss is robustness. As one can see, the size of the t test for H0 : β = β 0 is fairly constant around
the nominal size of 0.05, but the size of the test based on OLS varies with α0 . Furthermore, as
0 rises, the size of the t-test based on OLS becomes increasingly distorted while QD continues to
σyx

have sizes close to nominal.
Finally, we consider the stochastic growth model presented in Section 5. The data are generated
as follows. We fix the true value of capital intensity ψ to 0.25 and σ 2 to 1 and consider five values
of α: 1, 0.98, 0.95, 0.9, 0.8. We use data on consumption to estimate ψ, α and σ 2 using the second
method discussed in Section 5. This consists of solving for ψ, α and σ from the six autocovariances
of et (β), where β are the parameters of an AR(3) model. For the sake of comparison, we also use
18

the Kalman filter to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates. The results are reported in Table
4. Evidently, the QD estimates of ψ are close to the true value of 0.25, and the size of the t-test is
close to the nominal value for all values of α. In contrast, the MLE estimates are biased when α is
close to one, and the t test for the null hypothesis that ψ = 0.25 is severely distorted.

Relation to other

T -Consistent Linear Estimators

As discussed in Section 2, one of the problems with the OLS estimator when a unit root is present
√
P
is that the moment condition at the true value T g(α0 ) = √1T Tt=1 yt−1 εt does not satisfy a
central limit theorem. Although yt−1 is orthogonal to εt , the persistence of yt−1 requires a stronger
normalization and standard distribution theory cannot be used. The thrust of QD estimator is
to use moment conditions that satisfy a central limit theorem uniformly over values of α0 . The
approach can be used to estimate a broad range of models. However, for the simple AR(1) model,
the ideas underlying the QD estimation can be used to construct a two-step linear estimator. We
now show how this can be done and then relate this approximate QD estimator to other known
linear estimators of the AR(1) model with classical properties in the local-to-unity framework.
For the AR(1) model, the QD moment condition (3) replaces yt−1 with εt−j . As seen from equation
(4), the central limit theorem holds whether or not there is a unit root present. But the moment
condition can be understood in an instrumental variable setup because εt−j is uncorrelated with
εt and is hence a valid instrument. The only problem is that εt−j is not observed. But α
bOLS is
consistent for all |α0 | ≤ 1. Thus, let eet−1 = yt − α
bOLS yt−1 , noting that generated instruments do
not require a correction for the standard errors like generated regressors do. We can now define a
(hybrid differencing) HD estimator using the following moment condition:9
g HD (b
αHD ) =

eet−k (yt − α

We refer to α
bHD as a hybrid estimator because it is based on the covariance between the quasidifference of yt and a stationary random variable. Notice that the HD and QD use the same moment
9

Laroque and Salanie (1997) used two OLS regressions in stationary variables to obtain a
of the co-integrating vector.

19

condition. What distinguishes the HD from the QD is that the objective function of the HD is now
P
p
linear in α. Consistency of α
bHD follows from the fact that T1 Tt=1 et (α0 )e
et−k −→Eεt εt−k = 0. It is
straightforward to show that in the local-to-unity framework,
√

T (b
αHD − α0 ) ⇒ 2(1 + Jc (1)2 )−1 N (0, 1).

Once the HD is understood as an instrumental estimator, other possibilities arise. Instead of eet−1 ,
we can use any stationary series uncorrelated with the error term.10 For example, using ∆yt−1
would by-pass the need for a preliminary least squares estimation. The first differencing (FD)
estimator is:
PT

case when α0 is far from unit circle. That is, for the AR(1) model, α
bP H = α

While T (b

is thus more efficient at α0 = 1. Simulations presented in Table 5 show that the QD dominates the
FD and PH, but is comparable to the HD. The simulations also support the theoretical predictions
√
that the FD, HD, and QD are all asymptotically normal and T consistent.
No estimator is perfect and QD estimation has its drawbacks. As mentioned in the introduction,
√
the price we pay for asymptotic normality is that α
bQD converges at a rate of T instead of T when
10

As suggested by a referee, E(et (et−j − et−k )) = 0, 1 ≤ j < k is also a valid moment condition.

20

there is a unit root. Han et al. (2011) aggregate L stationary moment conditions and showed that
√
by suitable choice of L, uniform asymptotic normality can be achieved at a rate faster than T .
Extension of their result outside of the AR(p) model is, however, not straightforward. In contrast,
the QD framework is broadly applicable.

Concluding Comments

In this paper, we use a quasi-differencing framework to obtain estimators with classical properties
even when the underlying data are highly persistent. Quasi-differencing can render non-stationary
processes stationary so that classical limit theorems can be applied. However, the QD estimator
√
is T consistent rather than super-consistent in the local-to-unity framework. In exchange for
this slower convergence is generality, as QD estimation can be used in a broad range of linear and
non-linear models. However, there are several issues that remain to be solved. The first is allowing
J to be data dependent and increase with the sample size. The second is to allow for conditional
heteroscedasticity. Third, simulations suggest that the QD works well even when forcing process
is mildly explosive. Relaxing the assumption that the largest autoregressive root is inside the unit
disk may well be useful for practitioners. These issues are left for future investigation.

Proofs

The proofs proceed with the assumption that the weighting matrix WT is an identity matrix.

Proof of Proposition 1 (i): First, consider the problem of matching the j−th autocovariance.
That is, Qj (α) = (b
γj (α) − γj (α))2 , and α
bj = arg minα Qj (α). Under the assumption that α is the
true value, γ0 (α) = σ 2 , and γj (α) = 0 for all j > 0. Note that

As a result, the NQD objective function is the fourth-order polynomial:

Qj (α) = Qj + (α − α0 )Qj + (α − α0 )2 Qj + (α − α0 )3 Qj + (α − α0 )4 Qj .

(A.6)

This is a cubic equation of the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0, where x stands for (b
αj − α0 ) with the
obvious correspondence between the coefficients. The cubic equation may have one or three real
roots depending on the sign of the determinant:
∆ = 18abcd − 4b3 d + b2 c2 − 4ac3 − 27a2 d2 .
Given the orders established in (A.5), it can be shown that

The sign of the determinant ∆ is asymptotically defined by the sign of ξj . When the sign of ∆
is negative, there is a unique real root to equation (A.6); otherwise, there are three real roots.
However, in the case of three real roots, the middle one corresponds to the local maxima, while the
other two roots are the local minima of (A.1).
The next step is to work out the formulas for the roots and to check their rates of convergence
toward zero. For example, when there is only one real root, the formula is:

Using the asymptotic orders of the terms in (A.5) and after tedious algebra, we can deduce that
T x1 = Op (1) (that is T (b
αj − α0 ) = Op (1)). Similarly, using the explicit formula for cubic roots and
denoting the two non-central roots by x2 and x3 , we can deduce that when ∆ > 0, T 3/4 x2 = Op (1)
and T 3/4 x3 = Op (1) (that is, T 3/4 (b
αj − α0 ) = Op (1) in this case).
To find the asymptotic distribution of these roots, we start with the case of one root. Because T (b
αj −
α0 ) = Op (1), some terms in equation (A.6) are asymptotically negligible. Thus, asymptotically we

The equation has a solution only when ξj < 0. As shown above, this is the condition for the
cubic equation to have three roots. Thus, we proved that equation (6) holds for α

Proposition 1 (ii) and Proposition 2 are special cases of Proposition 3. Observe that
g j,F QD (β) = Aj,F QD + (β 0 − β)0 Bj,F QD + (β 0 − β)0 Cj,F QD (β 0 − β),
where Aj,F QD , Bj,F QD and Cj,F QD are defined in equations (11)-(13). The following three lemmas

Proof of Lemma A-2: Part (a) follows from applying the Central Limit Theorem (4) to the

where the Op (1/ T ) term appears due to the change of limits of summation by a finite number

absolutely summable MA coefficients. From Lemma S8 in the web Appendix of Mikusheva (2007b),

the elements of the right-bottom (p − 1) × (p − 1) sub-matrix satisfy conditions of Lemma A-1. The

If the largest (in absolute value) root λp is not real, then by definition of Rδ , it is less than

the conditions of Lemma A-1. Assume now that the largest root λp is a real number. We have

where x = β 0 − β. Since β 0 ∈ Rδ and β belongs to bounded neighborhood of Rδ , x is bounded.
There are two cases to consider: |λp | < δ1 < 1, and λp ≥ δ1 .

Case (i) |λp | < δ1 : We will show that for any fixed 0 < δ1 < 1 statement (A.8) holds uniformly
over β 0 ∈ Rδ ∩ {|λp | < δ1 }.
Since K > p, Q(x) ≥ f (x)0 f (x). For any orthonormal transformation A, Q(x) ≥ (Af (x))0 (Af (x)) ≥

Case (ii) |λp | ≥ δ1 : To show that for δ1 < 1 close enough to the unity, (A.8) holds uniformly
over β 0 ∈ Rδ ∩ {|λp | ≥ δ1 }, we divide the area |x| > ς from (A.8) into two regions: I1 = {x : |x| >

Consider x ∈ I1 . We will prove that for any fixed ς1 > 0, one can choose δ1 close enough to the

is taken over x ∈ I1 .
Applying the arguments and transformation as in (A.9), it can be shown that equations (A.11) and
(A.12) hold. Since A(1) converges to zero as δ1 converges to 1, one can choose δ1 close enough to 1
P
to make all terms except the (1,1)-th element of A(1) T1 Tt=p+1 Xt Xt0 sufficiently small, and all but
P
the (1,1)-th element of T1 Tt=p+1 eet+p+1 Xt0 converge in probability to its expected value of zero. In

It remains to show that T1 Tt=p+1 (εt+p+1 − A(1)yt−1 ) yt−1 satisfies the uniform Law of Large Numbers, and thus converges uniformly to a non-zero constant. To do so, we use the decomposition as
in Phillips and Solo (1992)) that εt+p+1 − A(1)yt−1 = ut − ut−1 , where ut is a series
√ with absolutely

summable MA coefficients. Since T (ut − ut−1 )yt−1 = − T (yt − yt−1 )ut + Op (1/ T ), Lemma A-1

applies, and T1 Tt=p+1 (εt+p+1 − A(1)yt−1 ) yt−1 converges in probability to its expectation. Since
A(1) PT

t=p+1 yt−1 is uniformly different from zero, this implies that for any fixed ς1 > 0 there
T E
exists δ1 < 1 such that uniformly over |λp | > δ1 an analog of (A.8) holds where the infinimum is
taken over x ∈ I1 .
Consider now x ∈ I2 . One can choose ς1 small enough and δ1 close enough to the unity such that
uniformly over β 0 ∈ Rδ ∩ {|λp | > δ1 }, an analog of (A.8) holds, where the infinimum is taken over
x ∈ I2 . Given that Bj,F QD and Cj,F QD are uniformly bounded,
fj (x) = x0−1 Bj,−1 + x0−1 Cj,−1 x−1 + op (ς1 ).
where x−1 = (x2 , ..., xp ) is (p − 1) × 1 sub-vector of x, and Bj,−1 and Cj,−1 are the (p − 1) × 1 and
(p − 1) × (p − 1) sub-matrixes of Bj,F QD and Cj,F QD corresponding to the last p − 1 components

Lemma A-4 showed that uniformly over α:
b j (θ) − Γ
b 0 (θ) + Ω0 k22 = k(θ0 − θ)Bj,2 + Cj (θ0 − θ)(θ0 − θ)0 k22 + op (1),
kΓ
and

b j (θ) − Γ
b 0 (θ) + Sk22 = k(θ0 − θ)Bj,2 + Cj (θ0 − θ)(θ0 − θ)0 k22 + op (1).
kΓ

We minimize the sum of such functions for j = 1, ..., K. Obviously, the minimized function is nonnegative and one of its minimal value of zero is achieved at θ = θ0 . The question is whether there
are any other minima. For this, there should exist θ such that k(θ0 − θ)Bj,2 + Cj (θ0 − θ)(θ0 − θ)0 k2 is
zero for all j. For a given j, the only non-trivial null of function k(θ0 − θ)Bj,2 + Cj (θ0 − θ)(θ0 − θ)0 k2
implies θj = θ0 + C1j Bj,2 which is asymptotically different for different j. This implies that for
K ≥ 2 no other asymptotic null of the objective function other than θ = θ0 exists, and thus θbK,F QD
and θbK,QD are consistent.
33

To derive the limit distribution of θbK,F QD , we use the fact that the first order condition must be
satisfied at θ = θbK,F QD . Now the first order condition is

Note: The true value of capital intensity is ψ = 0.25. The observed series is consumption. QD uses OLS estimate of
the standard deviation of innovations consumption for QD estimation. M LE corresponds to the maximum likelihood
estimation (Kalman filter) of the structural parameters. Three autocorrelation coefficients (i.e, the fitted model is
AR(3)) and six autocovariances are used in QD estimation. T-test and J-test sizes are for 5 percent level. Power of
the t-test is computed for the null of H0 : ψ = ψ0 − 0.1.
