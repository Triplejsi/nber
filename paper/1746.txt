Global or average economic perforisnce and the difference
between
the economic performances of the two countries
are "decoupled": they can
be studied independently of
each other, with average outcomes a function
only of current and past
average policy instrument values and
average
exogenous shocks, while performance differences are a function
only of
differences
and expected future differences in policy
instrument values and exogenos disturbances.
The "averages" model
(equations (14b) and (15b)) can indeed be viewed as

in current, past

a self—contained

model of a single closed
economy. Because the price deflators are predetermined and the real
of symmetrical

exchange rate "washes out" through the

assumption

structures, the "averages" model contains no nonpredeter—

mined,

forward—loolcjng or jump variables. In the richer structure of
the simulation model in the sequel to this

paper, the average or global

economy does contain forward—looking

variables, through forward—looking

invest decisions (Tobin' q) and wage setting. Note that after
analyzing and averages

and differences, we can easily retrieve individual

count performance, since 1 1/2 1d + 1a,

is a weak Condition, which
amounts to assuming that in a diagram with the
nominal interest rate on the
vertical axis and output on the horizontal
axis, the IS curve (after
using the Phillips curve to Substitute out the
(expected) rate of inflation) is
either downward—sloping or upward—sloping
and steeper than the LM curve. I assume that li(a) is satisfied.
Given

saddlepoint equilibrju and the "differences"

system either looks like Figure la (when the IS curve is downward—sloping

a22 > 0 3/ and the —O locus is

qualitatively similar in the two cases, I shall

First

among the policy issues to be considered now is the proper

response in the ROW to a unilateral U.S. fiscal contraction.

III. Responses to a tightening of U.S. fiscal policy

fiscal tightening without fiscal or monetary response
in the ROW and without monetary response in the U.S.A

111.1. U.S.

A fiscal tightening in the U.S.A. without any fiscal response in the
ROW is, in the notation of this paper, a reduction in the average fiscal
impulse (fe) and a reduction in the difference between the two countries'

fiscal impulses fd which is twice as large as the reduction in a. From
equations 16(a—e) it is clear that the long—run consequences of this
unilateral fiscal contraction will he the following:

(1) an improvement in the U.S.A's competitiveness Cc

increases);

(2) a lowering of the real interest rate in the U.S.A. and in the
rest of the world;

(3) an increase in the world real money stock because nominal
as well as real interest rates are lower in the U.S. and in the
R.O.W.

In Figure 2a we see that for c and 1d, the full long—run adjustment

from E1 to E2 occurs instantaneously. Relative US—ROW real money balances
are unaffected by the U.S. fiscal tightening. The required long—run
depreciation in the real exchange rate can therefore be brought about

iediately by a jump or step depreciation in the nominal exchange rate
of the United States.

— 14 —

In

the new long—run equilibrium the global stock of real money

balances viii be larger since lover nominal interest rates raise velocity.
Given nominal money growth rates in the U.S. and the ROW and without any
discrete changes in the levels of the nominal money stocks, the process
of increasing real balances requires that the rate of inflation be held
below the given rates of growth of the nominal money stocks. There will

therefore be a temporary global recession: ya declines. The global
recession affects the U.S. and the R.O.W. equally: y4 is zero throughout

the adjustment process. U.S. output declines because of the fiscal
tightening but the decline is mitigated somewhat as competitiveness

improves. The ROW suffers from its loss of competitiveness, which mirrors

the improvement In the U.S. competitiveness. The recession is therefore
concentrated in the non—traded goods sector of the U.S. and the traded

goods sector of the ROW. Nominal and real interest rates and inflation
rates in the U.S. and the ROW are affected equally by the U.S. fiscal
contraction: id, r'1 and

are zero throughtout. Both nominal and

real interest rates decline globally (and in each country). As in the
familiar

closed economy IS—Il.!, augmented Phillips curve model, the decline

in nominal and real interest rates mitigates the contraction of aggregate
demand but does not undo it completely.
There is "crowding out" (in our
policy experiment a reversal of crowding out) but less than 100 percent.
Note that because inflation declines during the recession, real interest

111.2 Monetary policy stabilizes the nominal exchange rate
One of the scenarios considered in the WEO consists of a tightening
of U.S. fiscal policy, unaccommodating U.S. monetary policy, unchanged

fiscal policy in the ROW and monetary policy in the ROW geared to interest

rate coupling. Given perfect international capital mobility, interest rate
coupling amounts to having a fixed nominal exchange rate. Under a fixed
exchange rate regime, a fiscal contraction in the U.S. will, with perfect
capital mobility, lead to a stock—shift outf low of capital from the U.S.,

a stock—shift loss U.S. foreign exchange reserves and a corresponding

contraction in the U.S. money stock. The ROW experiences the counterpart
stock—shift inflow of capital, stock—shift gain in foreign exchange

reserves and expansion of its mbney stock. It is therefore arbitrary
whether one assigns the stabilization of the exchange rate to the monetary

policy of the ROW or to the U.S. Under a fixed exchange rate regime
(which is expected to be permanent) there is effectively a single global

world money market or world UI schedule. Individual countries can choose
their own rates of domestic credit expansion and thus collectively
determine the growth of the world money stock. The distribution of this
world money stock across countries is determined by the individual countries'

changes

in domestic money demand and domestic credit expansion.

The formal analysis of the fixed exchange rate regime is very

simple. Let the global stock of gold and foreign exchange reserves be
constant and, for notational simplicity, equal to zero. The global money
stock is therefore the sum of the two countries' stocks of domestic

credit. Let m be the logarithm of the global nominal money stock, Dj the
logarithm of country i's stock of domestic credit and V the share of U.S.
domestic credit is total domestic credit.

Note that average global real

rate regime (1/2 £ given in equation (24)) behaves identically to
global real liquidity under the

average

freely floating, exchange rate regime (1a

(Compare equation (27) with y8 from equation (15b)). It is also checked
very easily that the long—run, steady state

effects of fiscal policy (or

other real shocks) are the same under fixed and floating rates.

When therefore we compare the

consequences of a tightening of U.S.

fiscal policy under a floating exchange rate with that under a fixed
exchange rate, holding global monetary policy constant in the sense that
the growth rates of domestic credit (and therefore the growth
rate of the
global stock of nominal, money)

are the same in the two regimes, the

recession in the U.S. following the fiscal

contraction will be smaller

under a floating exchange rate while in the ROW the recession will be
deeper with a floating rate.

The global loss of output is the same under the two exchange rate
regimes, but

while

under a floating rate the recesions in the U.S. and

the ROW are identical in

magnitude (although in the U.S. the non—traded

goods sector will, be hit while in the ROW it will be the traded goods

sector), under a fixed rate tie U.S. will

always experience a deeper

The short—run behavior of the real exchange rate is quite different
under the two regimes. As shown in Figure 3, under a floating exchange
rate U.S. competitiveness, which is a non—predetermined variable in this

case, sharply improves on impact to its new equilibrium level. This
jump—depreciation of c reflects a jump—depreciation of e, the nominal

exchange rate. While this clearly represents a hard landing for the U.S.
dollar, it represents a imich softer landing for the U.S. real economy

than the alternative scenario where the nominal exchange rate is kept

constant throughout. In the latter case U.S. competitiveness improves
gradually after the U.S. fiscal contraction and converges asymptotically
to the same level achieved immediately with a freely floating exchange

rate. The improvement in competitiveness is due to the U.S. rate of cost
inflation falling below that in the ROW because of the relatively deeper
recession in the U.S.

111.3 Policies that achieve an improvement in U.S.
competitiveness witout a contraction of world demand
In this subsection I take as given the fiscal tightening in the
United States as well as :he achievement of a lasting improvement in U.S.

external competitiveness. A floating exchange rate is again assumed.
A ROW fiscal expansion to match the U.S. fiscal contraction
In the formal setting

our little model, the transition to improved

U.S. competitiveness can be achieved instantaneously and without any
contraction of effective demand at home or abroad by having the U.S.
fiscal contraction matched by a corresponding ROW fiscal expansion.. In

ter of the dynamics of equations (l4a,b) and (15a,b) and the steady—
state conditions of equations (16a—e), this "package" consists of a

reduction in fd with f unchanged.

Figure 4 shows the instantaneous

adjustment process.

There is no change in real or nominal interest rates as the effects
on the global capital market of the two opposing fiscal impulses cancel

each other out. For a given U.S. fiscal
U.S. competitiveness is now doubled (in

contraction, the improvement in

our linear model) because of the

fiscal expansion in the Row. World aggregate demand is unchanged and so
is aggregate demand for each individual

country's output.

There are several qualifications to be made before this painless
adjustment package is recornmended for use in the real world. First,

while total output stays constant in each country, there is a shift
towards the production of tradeables in the U.S. and towards the production

of noritradeables in the ROW. Steelworkers

make poor hairdressers and

conversely. The problems sociated with changing the sectoral composition
of production, employment ad investment are ignored in our simple model.
Second, the selection of dosage and timing for the ROW fiscal
expansion is made to look 1rnpler than it is in practice because of the

assumption of known, idenIcal structures.
the case for a flexible policy

While this in no way weakens

response in principle, it makes the

practical task of selecting the right mix, dose and timing a much more
complicated matter than our iimple model may suggest.

I

Third,

a fi8cal expansion in the ROW may be opposed for structural or

allocative reasons. Increased public spending may be undesirable because
of its political irreversibility and because, at full employment, the

benefits from the spending are judged to be less than its cost. Lower
taxes or higher transfer payments may be undesirable because of possible
efficiency losses, undesirable incentive effects or for distributional
reasons.

Fourth, fiscal expansions (other than balanced—budget fiscal expan-

sions) entail larger deficits and, in time, a larger public debt. If the
real interest rate exceeds the growth rate of the real tax base, explosive

debt—deficit spirals are possible unless the primary (non—interest) deficit

is planned (and believed) to become a surplus in due course. If there is
no reputation for fiscal rectitude, temporary (increases in) deficits
will be extrapolated int.o the future. Fear of possible future monetization
of deficits u-ill raise long nominal interest rates. Increased uncertainty
about the future course of inflation may add a further risk premium to

however, avoid the potential crowding out resulting from such confidence

effects. It might therefore help if such a program were supervised by or

at least coordinated through an organization such as the I whose
reputation f or fiscal restraint is second to none.

— 23 —

Finally,
jg

currently

it may be judged that the global level of effective demand
excessive, and that a net reduction in global demand is in

order, as well as a realignment of U.S.

competitiveness. A unilateral

U.S. fiscal contraction might in that case be the right policy. The
point would seem to be mainly of academic interest, as in the opinion
of most observers

there remains a margin

of Keynesian slack in the world

economy.

A U.S. fiscal contraction matched by effective demand—
maintaining expansionary monetary policy changes
Calls for a change in the U.S. macroeconomic policy mix, from tight
money and loose fiscal policy to looser money and tighter fiscal policy
have been heard from all corners of the profession in recent years.
There are two kinds of monetary policy changes that could be used in the

present model: changes in level of the nominal money stock and changes
in the proportional growth rate of the nominal money stock.

Money jumps"
It is clear from inspection of the steady state conditions (16a, e)

and the equations of motion (14a, b) and (15a, b) that there is one and
only set of discrete (discontinuous) changes in the levels of the nominal

money stocks in both countries that will permit an instantaneous transition
at full employment (in both countries) to the new real long run equilibrium
associated with the unilateral reduction in the U.S. fiscal impulse dis-

cussed in Section 111.1. If df1 < 0 is the size of the U.S. fiscal
contraction, these nominal money jumps in both countries are given by
(28)

— 24 —

At

the predetermined price level, this nominal money jump provides

ju8t tfie right increase in real money balances demanded as a result of

the lower nominal (and real) world interest rate associated with the

lower global fiscal impulse. There is no need to force the price level
path below the nominal money stock

path through a policy of demand

deflation and unemployment. The steady state increase in real money
balances which in a new—classical model

with a non—predetermined, flex—

ible price level would be brought about by a discrete downward jump in
the price level path, is achieved in the Keynesian
level model by a stock—shift

increases the nominal

,

predetermined price

open market purchase in each country which

money stocks by the required amounts, It is the

stickiness of real money balances which makes a recession inevitable when
there is any exogenous shock or policy change which raises the long—run

demand for money balances. This stickiness of the real money stock
reflects both the stickiness of domestic
and exogenous shock—invariant

costs (assumed to be a policy—

structural property of private market

behavior), and the stickiness of
nominal money stock is a choice

monetary policy. If the level of the

variable at any given instant, policy

flexibility can make up for and compensate for domestic cost inflexibility.
The great advantage of the kind of once—and—for—all nominal money
stock jumps considered here is that they don't result in any change in
the rate of inflation, short

run or long run. They do cause the long—run

level of the path of prices to be higher than it would otherwise have

— 25 —

been, but since welfare costs are associated with the rate of inflation
rather than with the level of prices, 1/ this is no cause for concern.

The

major problem

with money jump policies is their effect on inflationary

expectations. The obvious analytical distinction between a discontinuous
discrete change in the level of the money stock path and a (finite)
change in the instantaneous rate of change of that path may not be as

obvious in practice, especially when the money stock path is sampled at
discrete time intervals: a once—and—f or—all upward level change at a
point in time in the middle of an observation interval t0 may look much

like an increase in the rate of growth between t0 and t0 + 1. If such
an apparent increase in the growth rate gets extrapolated into the

future, serious instability may result. Governments or central banks
with a reputation for monetary rectitude will be able to engineer once—
off money jumps without adverse effects on inflationary expectations.

Governments or central banks with a reputation for monetary laxness will
be prisoners of the markets' lack of confidence and may have to live with
the adverse effects on inflation expectations of any observed increase
in the money stock.

Note that if the monetary authorities had nominal income targets
rather than monetary targets, there should be no credibility problems

associated with a once—off increase in the nominal money stock. Nominal

1/ The statement is meant to apply to a world without uncertainty only.

— 26 —

income targets are velocity—corrected monetary targets.

They have

desirable operating characteristics whenever exogenous shocks or policy
changes necessitate a change in velocity.
Changes in money growth rates

The other monetary policy action (in both countries) that can achieve
the transition to an improved level of U.S. competitiveness without any

output or employment cost is an equal permanent increase in the rate of
growth of the nominal money stock in each country. It can again be
checked from the steady—state conditions (16a) —

(16e)

and from the

equations of motion (14a, b) and (15a, b) that the following permanent
increase in m1 and m2 will

achieve

an instantaneous transition at full

employment (in both countrog) to the new real long—run equilibrium
associated with the unilatral reduction in the U.S. fiscal impulse
discussed in Section 111.1.

This monetary policy respcne would, by raising the rate of inflation in
both countries, prevent the global real interest rate decline result1g
from the U.S. fiscal contraction from

being translated into a decline in

nominal interest rates. With nominal interest rates unchanged, there s
no increase in the demand for real money balances and consequently no
need for a recession to depress the

general price level path below the

nominal money stock path. The policy has one obvious undesirable fea:re:
a recession is prevented at the cost of having a permanently higher
of inflation in the world economy.

Row) to a sudden large fall
the value of a key

currency, taken to be the U.S. dollar for

ness in this paper. To determine

the nature of the

responses, we first must determine what

in

concrete-

appropriate policy

the causes of the sudden depre-

ciation of the currency

are. There are two broad classes of possible
causes: (a) the bursting of
a speculative bubble that had caused the
dollar to be overvalued in
relation to the "fundamentals."
(b) an actual
or perceived change in the
fundamentals driving the exchange rate. The
latter category can be subdivided into a number of
cases. (1) a portfolio shift against the dollar reflecting,
say, greater uncertainty about
the future prospects for
U.S. inflation. In the simple model of this
paper, this can be represented
by a reduction in U.S. liquidity
preference:
a fall in n1; (2) an increase in the

real risk premium on foreign—oe

U.S. assets. This could reflect fear of future increases
in taxation
of U.S. interest income
and, conceivably, a greater perceived risk of
repudiation or default. In the model this can be represented
by an
increase in t2—11: the real risk premium is like a net
tax on U.S. interest
income; (3) an unexpected
increase in the level of the
U.S. money stock
or in the rate of U.S.
monetary growth; (4) an unexpected tightening of
the U.S. fiscal Stance.
All four events should be thought of in relative terms,
e.g., the
portfolio shift against the dollar reflects an increase
in uncertainty
about u.s. inflation relative
to uncertainty about inflation in the rest

— 28 —

of

the world. Similarly, it is looser U.S. monetary policy relative to

monetary policy elsewhere or tighter U.S. fiscal policy relative to
fiscal policy elsewhere that puts downward pressure on the dollar.

An important issue in determining the appropriate policy response
to a sudden drop of the dollar in response to a change in private sector
perceptions concerning the likely future course of the fundamentals, is
whether the national authorities and the international coordinating agency

share these new perceptions. A different approach will in general be
called for if the authorities believe they have information superior to
that used by private agents in forming expectations, but there is no way

of sharing this information with private market participants or of con—
vincirig them of its relevance. In what follows, no superior public sector
information is assumed.
1.

A bursting bubble
It is well—known that the solution of rational expectations models

with forward—looking, non—predetermined state variables (such as the
nominal and the real exchange rate in our model) may be characterized by
a bubble; that is, the behavior of the endogenous variables may be
influenced by variables that matter only because, somehow, private agents

believe that they matter. These bubble processes, which affect expectations in a self—validating nanner, may be functions of the fundamental
variables (i.e. those variabl,s that enter into the structure of the
model other than merely by being part of the information set used to form

I

I
— 29 —

expectations)

or of completely extraneous or spurious variables of the

"sunspdt" variety (Blanchard (79); Azariadis [1981], Obstfeld and Rogoff

[1983]). In Figure 5, it is assumed that all "fundamentalg have constant values, now and in the future, that the steady state equilibrium corresponding to these constant values for the fundamentals is E0
and that the associated convergent saddle path is S0S0. Suppose, without
loss of generality, that the predetermined variable is at its steady—state

value £.

The non—predetermined variable, c, however, is on a bubble

path EE which overvalues it relative to the path warranted by the fun-

damentals (S0S0). Its value at to, the time the bubble bursts is
The bursting of the bubble moves c instantaneously to its fundamental

value c*. In a rational world, there must be uncertainty about the
direction of the discrete jump in the exchange rate at to. The instantaneous discrete upward jump in c and e would, if it were anticipated
with certainty, promise an infinite rate of return to shorting the dollar

the instant before to. There could however be a set of beliefs which at
to, attaches some probability I1, to a return to the fundamental value

(c c*_c0) and some probability 1 —

to a further discrete

downward jump in c to c1 which puts the exchange rate on a bubble path
even further removed from its fundamental value. Provided 1I0(c* —

short—run lower nominal and real interest rates and because of the
improvement in competitiveness. Average world economic activity also
rises (ya increases) because of the short—run downward pressure on

nominal and real interest rates. Activity levels in the ROW are,
however, depressed, as the loss of competitiveness outweighs the effect

of lower interest rates. If the initial equilibrium was deemed satisfactory, the obvious policy response to the fall in liquidity preference
is a matching once—off reduction in the level of the U.S. nominal money

stock. This woud leave all real and nominal variables (other than ti)
unchanged.

If the shift out of U.S. ney represents stock—shift currency
substitution and has as its counterpart a matching stock—shift increase

as large. Average real world activity (ya, ia, a and ra) are unchanged
in the short run and in the long run. The behavior of c and td is like
that illustrated in the top diagram of Figure 6, but with a Bhift up and

to the left of the saddlepath that is twice as large. The U.S. experiences
a transitional boom that is matched by a transitional slump in the ROW.
The obvious way to neutralize this once—off currency substitution and

stabilize the exchange rate is to contract the U.S. money stock by —n

and expand the ROW money stock by 2• Such monetary policy changes in
addition may well have favorable effects (not formally modelled here) on
the relative changes in inflation uncertainty that may have prompted the
money demand shifts in the first place.

An increase in the real U.S. risk

An increase in the relative

perceived real riskiness of foreign

investment in the U.S. will in the long run raise the U.S. real and
nominal interest rates and lower the ROW real and nominal interest
rates, leaving the average world rates

unchanged. The increase in U.S.

riskiness and reduction in ROW riskiness are assumed to apply
only to
foreign investors, not to domestic capital formation in either
country.

Policy—induced exchange rate collapses
The response of the exchange rate to changes in fiscal and monetary
policy in the United States and ROW has already been discussed in Sec-

tion III. The only point worth repeating here is that a Thard landing"
for the U.S. dollar need not represent a hard landing for the U.S. economy

or for the ROW. If the initial situation is one characterized by current
and anticipated future lax U.S. fiscal policy and tight U.S. monetary
policy, these fundamentals are likely to be reflected in a strong (an

'overvalued") U.S. real exchange rate. The first—best cooperative, coordinated global policy package to change this unfavorable equilibrium (fiscal
contraction in the U.S., once—off monety stock increases in the U.S. and
the ROW to meet the resulting fall in velocity) is accompanied by a dollar

"collapse." It may seem paradoxical that the restoration of confidence

The first question that needs to be answered before one can determine the appropriate U.S. and ROW policy responses to a global economic

slowdown concerns the cause(s) of this slowdown. A distinction imst be
made between a slowdown resulting from an adverse supply—side shock
(modeled

in our simple model by a temporary or permanent fall in y

or

Y2) and a demand—induced slowdown. Amont the latter we can again dis-

tinguish adverse money demand shocks (increases in T1 and n2) and reductions in private U.S. or ROW demand for goods and services (which can be

represented

as reductions in f1 or f2).

Adverse supply—side developments
Permanent reductions in productive capacity in the U.S. and the ROW
raise the long—run real interest rate everywhere and thus bring demand

down in line with supply. Nominal interest rates will also rise if money
growth rates are unaffected and, both through real income and interest
rate effects, the demand for real money balances in both regions will

(affecting

both regions equally) which in the long run lowers the
long—
run stcck of money balances.
In the very short run, output (which is

demand—detefled) actually rises because higher inflation
reduces the
real interest rate (nominal

interest rates rise less than one—for—one

because the LM curve is not vertical).

The policy response that

prevents the emergence of excess demand and
inflationary pressures during the transition to the lower levels
of

capacity Output, involves a contraction of demand which
can be achieved
either by fiscal or
monetary means (or by a combination of

the two). If

no long—run change in competitiveness is desired,
any fiscal contraction
should be equal in the
two countries. Probably the simplest coordinated
policy action that achieves the
new long—run equilibrju at E1 in Figure 8
immediately, is a reduction in

E03 and Eo). The same reduction in

economy (without excess demand) from
E0 to E1
where it will stay until
t. At t1 both nominal money stocks should be
increased again by the
sane percentage by which they were reduced at
in order to achieve a painless and instantaneous
restoration of full

equilibrj at E1.

An adverse permanent supply shock in the United States alone, say,
would cause a long—run worsening of the U.S. competitiveness (required to
choke off global demand for U.S. output), some increase in global real

and nominal interest rates (but less than with a coon decline in capacity
output), a decline in U.S. real money balances and a smaller decline in

ROW real money balances. On impact, there is likely to be a step appreciation of the dollar. After that the real exchange rate continues to appreciate gradually towards its new long—run equilibrium. Real interest
rates in the United States will be below those in the ROW during the

transition. A reduction in the U.S. nominal money stock by an amount

will permit an instantaneous transition to the new real long—run equilibrium with lower values of c, 1d, and 1a, avoiding the transitory inflation in the United States and the transitory contraction in the ROW that
would otherwise occur.

A demand—induced slowdown in economic activity
When the cause of a disappointing level of economic activity is a
decline in some component of private demand, appropriately designed
demand management can minimize the damage and, in the present model, can

be used to avoid it altogether. Increases in private liquidity preference

(n1 and n2) can be met with

corresponding once—off increases in the

levels of the nominal
money stocks——rn1 and m2. A downward shift in the
private consumption functions or a collapse of animal spirits
can be

offset directly by corresponding fiscal stimuli fj and

budget multiplier theorem
retains some validity, these fiscal stimuli can
be provided without
increasing the deficit. Supply—side

rates) are sufficient.

VI. Conclusion
This paper presents

a rather old—fashioned study of demand management
in an open, interdependereconomic system. Three contingencies discussed
in the September 1985
WorL Economic Outlook
were analyzed using an
eclectic, short—run Keynee
n, long—run classical, two—country model.
The main conclusion is tha n active
monetary and/or fiscal response in
both countries or regions s in general required
to minimize the costs
associated with the adjustment
process resulting from a variety of demand—side

or Supply—side shocks. One

exception to this rule is the case of a currency

collapse resulting from the bursting of an exchange market
speculative bubble.

A unilateral U.S. fiscal contradition

will cause a temporary slowdown of

world economic activity as well as a sudden drop in the nominal and

real value of the dollar. Merely

preventing the nominal exchange

rate from changing does not reduce the magnitude of the global recession
or alter the long—run real adjustment that takes place, but it would
redistribute the unchanged global unemployment and excess capacity
burden towards the United States

and away from the ROW. A no—response

policy would be consistent with the

achievement of improved U.S.

competitiveness at full employment if the initial situation were
characterized not only by a U.S. fiscal-monetary policy mix that

is biased towards fiscal

expansion and monetary tightness, resulting
in a poor U.S. international
competitive position, but also by global

excess demand. An expansionary fiscal

move in the ROW or a combined

expansionary monetary policy move in both the United States and the
ROW or a combined expansionary

monetary policy move in both the United

States and the ROW could achieve

tbe desired traverse to a better

level of U.S. competitveness without

a global slump. These monetary

stimuli need not be permanent increases in the rate of
money growth.

Once—off credible open market

purchases raising the levels of the

nominal money stocks suffice.

To provide truly satisfactory answers to the questions raised in the
WEO tM model of this paper would have to be extended in a number of
directions. The WEO approaches the macroeconomic issues of the industrialized world in a three—region setting: the United States; Europe;
and Japan plus Canada. The complexity entailed in going to three regions
virtually obliges one to use numerical rather than analytical methods.
The model of this paper ignores all stock—flow asset dynamics, those
coming from the government budget identities, those coming from the
current account of the balance of payments, and those resulting from real

capital accumulation. 1/ Again, their incorporation requires the use of

numerical methods. Finally, it would be extremely desirable to allow
explicitly for uncertainty. Adding some linear stochastic processes with
known coefficients to the deterministic model is feasible but does not

constitute much of an advance. Anything more complicated, even linear
models with stochastic coefficients, let alone non—linear stochastic
models, means that we enter the mathematical or computational stratosphere.

The modelling language we would like to use just does not exist yet.
The logic of the model used in this paper, and indeed of any model
that permits persistent disequilibrium or non—Walrasian equilibrium is
that monetary and fiscal policy instruments can be used actively to
stabilize output, employment, and the price level in response to a whole

The technical
