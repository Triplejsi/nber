Corporate Acquisitions, Diversification, and the Firm’s Lifecycle

NBER Working Paper No. 17463
September 2011
JEL No. G3
ABSTRACT
Lifecycle theories of mergers and diversification predict that firms make acquisitions and diversify
when their internal growth opportunities become exhausted. Free cash flow theories make similar
predictions. In contrast to these theories, we find that the acquisition rate of firms (defined as the number
of acquisitions in an IPO cohort-year divided by the number of firms in that cohort-year) follows a
u-shape through their lifecycle as public firms, with young and mature firms being equally acquisitive
but more so than middle-aged firms. Firms that go public during the merger/IPO wave of the 1990s
are significantly more acquisitive early in their public life than firms that go public at other times.
Young public firms have a lower acquisition rate of public firms than mature firms, but the opposite
is true for acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries. Strikingly, firms diversify early in their life
and there is a 41% chance that a firm’s first acquisition is a diversifying acquisition. The stock market
reacts more favorably to acquisitions by young firms than to acquisitions by mature firms except for
acquisitions of public firms paid for with stock. There is no evidence that the market reacts more adversely
to diversifying acquisitions by young firms than to other acquisitions.

1. Introduction
Existing theories of firms going public and of acquisitions offer a rich set of hypotheses concerning
the role of acquisitions during a firm’s lifecycle. The first hypothesis is that firms go public when they
have good internal investment opportunities, so that we would expect young firms to focus on organic
growth rather than growth through acquisitions. With this hypothesis, the acquisition rate should increase
over time. The second hypothesis is that firms make acquisitions, especially diversifying acquisitions,
when they have exhausted their internal growth opportunities, so that we expect mature firms to be more
active in acquisitions than young firms and this effect should be stronger for diversifying acquisitions.
The third hypothesis is that corporate acquisitions are just another form of investment, so that firms that
invest a lot make a lot of acquisitions. With this hypothesis, firms should make more acquisitions early in
their life because young firms grow faster.1 Fourth, to the extent that public firms can make acquisitions
on better terms, perhaps because they can finance them more cheaply or because they can use their stock
as a currency, we would observe a spike in acquisitions early in the life of firms because they would have
postponed making acquisitions until they went public. Finally, if firms go public because the market
overvalues them, this would lead them to make more stock acquisitions. In this paper, we examine key
predictions of these different theories of the role of corporate acquisitions in the lifecycle of firms.
After excluding the firms that do not meet our data requirements, we have a sample of 6,548 firms
that IPO from 1975 to 2002. We then follow these firms through time as long as they are listed, so that we
can estimate the extent to which corporations make acquisitions at various stages of their lifecycle as
public firms. The predictions of the theories we consider are predictions for the lifecycle of firms and,
therefore, they should hold irrespective of the market conditions when firms go public. If we were to
focus mostly on firm-year data, we would be giving most weight to IPOs in the years when the market is
the most active, so that our results might just reflect the acquisition activity of firms that go public in the
hottest markets. To avoid this problem, most of our analysis focuses on event years, where we define an
event year as the year from the IPO, and average event-years across IPO cohorts.

When we measure acquisition activity by the conditional acquisition rate for an event year, which we
define as the ratio of the number of acquisitions for the firms in a cohort’s event year divided by the
number of firms from that cohort alive at the beginning of the event year averaged across IPO cohorts, we
find that firms are most active in the corporate acquisition market in the year following their IPO. From
the IPO onward, the conditional acquisition rate follows a u-shape, so that it is higher when firms are
young (first three years after IPO) and when they are mature (more than ten years since IPO). While the
conditional acquisition rate of young firms does not differ from the conditional acquisition rate of mature
firms, young firms acquire fewer public firms than mature firms. However, irrespective of a firm’s age,
acquisitions of public firms represent a small minority of the acquisitions. Our evidence is consistent with
the hypothesis that acquisitions and internal investment are complementary for young public firms. It is
not supportive of the hypothesis that firms are most active in the market for acquisitions when their
internal growth opportunities have shrunk. Further, there is no difference between young and mature
firms in the extent to which they engage in diversifying acquisitions. There is therefore no support for
theories that predict that firms diversify in their maturity when they have exhausted their internal growth
opportunities.
There is a considerable literature that emphasizes the role of market conditions on a firm’s decision to
go public (for a review, see Ritter and Welch (2002)). According to that literature, firms are more likely
to go public when valuations are high. As a result, there is clustering in going public decisions. We find
that whether a firm goes public in a hot or a cold IPO market has no implications for how its propensity to
make acquisitions changes as it ages. However, young firms acquire more relative to mature firms during
the hot merger market of the 1990s. It is therefore not surprising that firms that IPOed in the 1980s
typically have their highest acquisition rate later in life in contrast to firms that IPOed in the 1990s that
have their highest acquisition rate in the first full calendar year of their life.
We examine more directly the spike in acquisitions that takes place in the first year after the IPO. We
find that it is a spike in acquisitions of private firms, not public firms. Further, the spike in acquisitions is
driven by cash acquisitions rather than stock acquisitions. There is no significant spike in equity-financed

3

acquisitions, so that the hypothesis that firms go public because of overvaluation and use their overvalued
equity to make acquisitions is not supported. The acquisition spike is not concentrated in acquisitions
within the acquirer’s industry as there is a similar spike across diversifying and non-diversifying
acquisitions.
With our approach, we focus on the conditional acquisition rate of firms of a given age as public
firms. We examine, however, whether our results also hold if we use a different measure of the
conditional acquisition rate, namely the total value of deals by firms of a given age divided by the assets
held by firms of that age. This measure, which we call the conditional dollar acquisition rate, suffers from
the problem that the value of the deal is unavailable for a large fraction of the deals. We find that firms
spend more on acquisitions early in life, but this result is driven by the merger wave of the 1990s. If we
exclude firms that are young during that merger wave, there is no difference between the spending on
acquisitions for young and mature firms. When we compare the conditional dollar acquisition rate for
young and mature firms, we find that young firms make more acquisitions of private firms and more
related acquisitions than mature firms. Strikingly, the conditional dollar acquisition rate for diversifying
acquisitions is not significantly different from the conditional dollar acquisition rate of related
acquisitions for young or for mature firms. Finally, we also find that IPO firms with poor first-day returns
experience more of a drop in acquisitions later in life than other IPO firms.
Throughout the paper we focus on the lifecycle of firms as public firms. An obvious issue with this
approach is that our results might be due to firms that are young relative to their incorporation and young
firms make more acquisitions. With this view, it would not make sense to start our analysis at the IPO and
the role of the IPO in our analysis would be spurious. We examine this possibility by dividing firms at
the IPO into age quintiles relative to incorporation. The spike at year one we document holds irrespective
of the age relative to incorporation at the IPO. Similarly, we also find that young and mature firms have
similar acquisition rates irrespective of the age since incorporation of firms when they go public. While
the IPO firms that belong to the lowest quintile of age since incorporation acquire more when young than
when mature, this result is completely driven by the IPO cohorts from 1995 to 2000.

4

Our evidence seems inconsistent with the view that firms make acquisitions when they have
exhausted internal growth opportunities. However, it could still be the case that mature firms make
acquisitions for that motive while young firms do not. To the extent that an acquisition announcement
conveys information about a firm’s growth opportunities when the firm is older but not when it is
younger, we would expect a more adverse reaction to acquisitions by older firms. The literature has used
this argument to explain the adverse stock-price reaction for the announcement of acquisitions of public
firms paid for with equity (e.g., Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2004)). We find that, except for
acquisitions of public firms paid for with equity, the stock-price reaction is more positive for younger
firms. Lastly, the worst stock-price reaction occurs for acquisitions of public firms in the same industry
paid for with stock. There is no difference in the stock-price reaction between such acquisitions made by
young firms and made by mature firms.
The existing evidence shows that it is plausible that a reason for firms to go public is that it gives
them an advantage in making corporate acquisitions as suggested by Lyandres, Zhdanov, and Hsieh
(2008). However, the precise nature of this advantage is unclear. While the literature has focused on the
acquisition rate, the post-IPO spike exists only for acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries. The
absence of a post-IPO spike for acquisitions of public firms requires a theory of the post-IPO acquisition
spike that explains why young public firms have an advantage in acquiring private firms but not public
firms. Further, as already discussed, IPO firms use cash to pay for acquisitions more than they use equity.
The neo-classical view of acquisitions is that they reallocate corporate assets to more productive uses.
In this vein, Jovanovic and Rousseau (2002) develop a q-theory of investment. In their theory, investment
can take place through capital expenditures as well as through acquisitions. High q firms make
acquisitions because they have greater productivity that they can transfer to the acquired firm. Younger
firms have higher qs as they go public. With this theory, we would therefore expect IPO firms to be active
in the acquisition market. This theory does not explain, however, why the acquisition rate does not appear
to differ between young and mature firms on average, why there is an initial IPO spike, and why this
spike is focused on acquisitions of private companies.

5

A different literature focuses on the role of misvaluation in acquisition decisions by firms. With this
literature, firms with high qs are more likely to be overvalued. Firms could time their IPOs to when the
market is likely to overvalue them and engage in acquisitions using their overvalued equity. In particular,
Shleifer and Vishny (2003) provide a model of acquisitions made by overvalued firms and empirical
papers find evidence for a role of overvaluation in acquisition decisions and outcomes (e.g., Dong,
Hirshleifer, Richardson, and Teoh (2006), Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, and Viswanathan (2005)). However,
we find that, for the acquisitions where the method of payment is known, more acquisitions are paid for
with cash than with stock for both young and mature firms.
There is a large literature on the benefits and costs of corporate diversification. In neo-classical
models, firms diversify when they have unique resources that can be applied to projects in different
industries and when their prospects in their industry are no better than in another industry that they
diversify into (see, for instance, Gomes and Livdan (2004), Maksimovic and Phillips (2001), Matsusaka
(2001)). Maksimovic and Phillips (2001) provide tests that are supportive of this perspective. In their
model, more efficient firms acquire assets and conglomerates sell their less productive assets following
demand shocks in the industry of these assets. Maksimovic and Phillips (2002) find support for these
ideas in a study of the market for corporate assets. If firms that undergo an IPO are more efficient firms,
the existence of a spike in acquisitions would be consistent with their model. Their data source includes
both private and public firms. For their approach to explain our results, public firms should have a
productivity advantage over private firms since we find that young public firms have a much higher
acquisition rate for private firms than they do for public firms. The model of Clementi (2002) could
explain such an outcome. In that model, firms are capital-constrained and go public following a favorable
productivity shock to raise more capital. In Gomes and Livdan (2004), firms diversify to take advantage
of economies of scope and because “diversification allows a mature, slow-growing firm to explore
attractive new productive opportunities.” Their model predicts that firms whose activities have a lower
rate of return diversify. Such firms are not generally viewed to be firms that just had an IPO.

6

Alternatively, agency models also suggest that firms make diversifying acquisitions to maximize
managerial rents when they have poor prospects in their industry (see, for instance, Jensen (1993)), but
for such firms, acquisitions are not efficient. With these types of explanations for diversification, we
would expect firms to make diversifying acquisitions later in their life since we would expect firms that
go public to have good prospects. The evidence we uncover that firms make diversifying acquisitions
throughout their life and that the rate at which they make such acquisitions does not appear to change
much through their life seems to create a challenge for such models.
Other papers examine the extent to which young firms make acquisitions and find that young firms
are extremely active and, even though our focus and approaches differ, our paper builds on these earlier
contributions. In an important contribution, Celikyurt, Sevilir, and Shivdasani (2010) show that firms are
very active acquirers immediately after their IPO using a sample of IPOs from 1985 to 2004. They find
young firms to be more active in acquisitions than firms that are more than 5 years from their IPO. In
contrast to them, we focus on the whole lifecycle of firms and investigate theories that pertain more to
mature firms. Consequently, our focus is on a comparison of young firms to firms that are more than 10
years from their IPO. This focus leads us to have a different sample from theirs. First, we have IPOs since
1975. Such a sample allows us to track acquisitions for firms that are more than ten years from their IPO
for twenty-one years. Second, we include all IPOs while they use IPOs with proceeds greater than $100
million in 2004 dollars. A sample restricted to IPOs with proceeds greater than $100 million would be a
much smaller sample, so that earlier cohorts would be too thin when the firms reach maturity. More
fundamentally, our approach differs from theirs in that we focus on cohort evidence rather than firm-level
evidence. This is because our focus is on lifecycle predictions and these predictions should hold
irrespective of when a firm IPOs, so that they should hold across cohorts. We can then test separately
whether IPO and merger market conditions at the time of a cohort goes public affect the behavior of firms
in that cohort over their lifecycle. Lyandres, Zhdanov, and Hsieh (2008) use a much longer sample to
show the rate of acquisition of IPOs and how it relates to merger waves. The fact that they find that high

7

IPO intensity precedes merger waves suggests that the high acquisition intensity of IPO firms may be
related to the degree of activity in the M&A merger market. Our evidence shows that this is the case.
Alimov and Mikkelson (2008) examine the investment behavior of firms that go public in favorable
market conditions (defined as conditions where there is a high rate of firms going public and high
valuations). They find that firms that IPO in these conditions tend to spend more on acquisitions. To the
extent that high valuations are associated with an active merger market, our results would be consistent
with theirs even though the conditions of the IPO market do not appear sufficient by themselves to predict
the intensity of acquisition activity by IPO firms.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the construction of our sample of IPOs and
of the acquisitions made by these firms. In Section 3, we show evidence on the rate of acquisition of firms
as a function of their age. In Section 4, we examine in more detail the acquisition rate of young firms and
contrast the acquisition behavior of firms immediately after their IPO to the acquisition behavior of more
mature firms. In Section 5, we analyze the abnormal returns associated with acquisitions for young and
mature firms. We conclude in Section 6.

2. Sample construction and description
In this section, we describe how we construct our sample of IPOs and then how we obtain our sample
of acquisitions made by the IPO firms. The population of firms and their deals are obtained using the
SDC database maintained by Thompson Financial Database. The IPO sample includes 6,816 original US
common stock offerings from 1975 to 2002, excluding unit issues, spinoffs, privatizations, reverse LBOs,
rights issues, ADRs, closed funds and trusts, and REITs. 6,548 firms out of the 6,816 IPOs have unique
PERM numbers, which allow us to get the data on stock prices from the CRSP database. By way of
comparison, Celikyurt, Sevilir, and Shivdasani (2010) have 1,250 IPOs in their dataset from 1985 to 2004
that have proceeds greater than $100 million in 2004 dollars. Our sample of IPOs is mostly the same as
the sample made available by Professor Ritter on his website. The major exception is that we include all

8

industries in the sample used for the results reported in the tables, while he excludes regulated industries.
We will also discuss results that exclude these industries.
Table 1 shows our sample of 6,548 IPO firms. It is not surprising in light of the existing evidence on
IPOs that the number of IPOs varies substantially over time. As expected, we have a large number of
IPOs in the second half of the 1990s. The period from January 1995 to December 2000 has 38.58% of our
IPOs. Further, underpricing is highest in 1999 and 2000. There is a high attrition rate for the firms in our
sample. Except for the IPOs since 1997, there is no IPO cohort that has a survival rate greater than 30% to
the end of the sample period. For the IPO cohorts in the first ten years of the sample, all of them have a
survival rate equal to or lower than 20%.
Through most of the paper, we focus on acquisition transactions where a firm attempts to acquire
another firm, whether public or private, or a subsidiary of another firm, but we also discuss results for a
sample of completed acquisitions.2 The measure involving acquisition attempts may be a better measure
of acquisitive activity by a firm since it measures actions under its control where it aims to acquire
another firm. The measure involving completed acquisitions is a better measure of how a firm changes as
a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries are almost always completed.
Consequently, a focus on acquisition attempts may bias the results towards a higher acquisition rate for
mature firms since these firms focus more on acquiring public firms, which have a lower rate of
completion. The sample of completed acquisitions is constructed as follows. We first eliminate all deals
where we cannot ascertain that the acquirer owns less than 50% of the acquired firm before the
acquisition announcement. Within this subset of acquisitions, we then keep only the acquisitions where
we can ascertain that the acquirer owns 100% of the acquired firm after the acquisition. We call this
sample the sample of completed acquisitions.
Acquisition transactions for these 6,548 firms are obtained from the SDC Mergers & Acquisitions
database. Data on acquisitions is sparse before 1981. Therefore, we include only acquisitions announced
from 1981 through 2006. We exclude repurchases, recapitalizations, and self-tenders. We include
2

In this paper, we use the term subsidiary acquisition to denote the acquisition of a subsidiary, division, or a branch.

9

acquisitions made by all IPO firms in our sample. Proceeding this way, we do not have data on
acquisitions by IPOs before 1981 in the early years of these firms, but we have data on firms that are
more than twenty-one years from their IPO that we would not have otherwise. A large number, 4,776, of
6,548 firms (73%) that had their IPO in the period from 1975 to 2002 engaged in at least one merger or
acquisition transaction in 1981-2006.3 These 4,776 firms had a total of 28,476 transactions with an
average of 5.96 deals per firm, while 1,772 firms had no transaction recorded in this comprehensive
database. SDC has information about acquisitions by the IPO firms that took place before these firms
went public. We do not use that information in the following because it is not comprehensive. However,
1% of firms announced an acquisition on the same day as their IPO and we use that information.

3. The acquisition rate through the firm’s lifecycle
In this section, we investigate the conditional acquisition rate of firms through their lifecycle. Table 2
reports the conditional acquisition rate for each IPO cohort in event years, where the IPO is year 0. The
conditional acquisition rate is defined as the number of acquisitions by firms from a cohort in an event
year divided by the number of firms in that cohort that have survived until the beginning of that event
year. It is therefore the average number of acquisitions per firm in a cohort in a fiscal year. We call this
statistic the conditional acquisition rate in the remainder of the paper. In the table, year 0 is a partial year.
Table 2 shows the mean and median conditional acquisition rates for each year in the lifetime of a
firm from year 0 to year 25. We cut off the early cohorts at year 25 because there are too few firms in
each cohort after that year. Firms make acquisitions steadily through their life. No cohort with an IPO
after 1978 has a year without acquisitions. The peak mean conditional acquisition rate is in year 1, the
first full calendar year that a firm is public. The two highest median conditional acquisition rates are 0.58
in year 1 and 0.59 in year 22. The highest year 1 conditional acquisition rate is 1.87 for the 1997 cohort.
Five cohorts have an average conditional acquisition rate that exceeds one in year 1. All these cohorts are
in the second half of the 1990s when the M&A market was extremely active.
3

The SDC database for M&A transactions starts in 1979.

10

In Table 2, we show the year for each cohort when it has its highest conditional acquisition rate. The
table shows a striking change in the peak year of the conditional acquisition rate. The cohorts in the 1970s
and the 1980s have a peak acquisition rate in later years of their life. Until 1990, all peak year conditional
acquisition rates are after year 5. All but two are in year 10 or later. After 1991, all cohorts have a peak
conditional acquisition year before year 4 and almost all (9 out of 11) have a peak conditional acquisition
rate year in year 1. The phenomenon of unusually high acquisitive activity by new firms is therefore one
that holds for the 1990s but not earlier. It is well-known, however, that characteristics of IPO firms
changed in the 1990s, in that new public firms were less well-established than they were earlier (see Fama
and French (2004)). In particular, firms that went public before the 1990s were more likely to be
profitable when they went public. Another important consideration is that the firms that went public in the
1990s faced a hot M&A market in their youth. We investigate the relevance of this last consideration in
the next sub-section.
Looking at the evolution of the mean conditional acquisition rate after year 1, we see that it falls after
year 1, reaching a minimum of 0.34 in year 5, and then increases again, so that the conditional acquisition
rate of firms after year ten is more like the conditional acquisition rate of young firms than the conditional
acquisition rate of firms in years 5 to 10. This pattern holds as well when we consider the median
conditional acquisition rate. It follows from these observations that the conditional acquisition rate of
firms through their lifecycle follows a u-shape pattern. It is high in a firm’s youth, lower in its middle age,
and high again when it reaches maturity. Our regression analysis in the next section finds that the
conditional acquisition rate is significantly lower during these event years. Figure 1 shows the conditional
acquisition rates in each event year for each IPO cohort. Though we do not reproduce the results in a
table, we reach similar conclusions when we consider the sample of completed acquisitions.
So far, we have focused on the number of acquisitions made by IPO firms. The same number of
acquisitions at different stages of a firm’s life could have very different implications if in one event year
the acquisitions are small and in the other they are large. Ideally, therefore, we would also examine the
amounts spent on acquisitions by firms during their lifecycle. As already explained, however, SDC does

11

not report the consideration paid for a large fraction of acquisitions. For the acquisitions used in Table 2,
the acquisition consideration is not available for 48.32% of the acquisitions. Nevertheless, we report
results for the amount spent on acquisitions as a fraction of the assets owned by firms in a cohort at the
beginning of the year in Table 3. To account for deals with no information, we construct the ratio using
only the firms for which information on acquisition consideration is available for each acquisition they
make and for which total assets is available at the beginning of the year. We call this statistic the
conditional dollar acquisition rate. The rate is unbiased if the rate for the firms with incomplete or no
information is the same as the rate for the firms with full information. Because we exclude firms that
make acquisitions for which we do not have deal size information, some cohort years drop out in Table 3,
so that the average for some event years involves fewer cohorts than in Table 2.
In Table 3, the mean conditional dollar acquisition rate is highest in year 2. The median conditional
dollar acquisition rate is highest in year 1 and never reaches again a rate half as a high as that rate after
year 8. The mean conditional dollar acquisition rate is higher for young firms, but there are some years
where older firms have a conditional dollar acquisition rate that is close to the mean of year 1. It is useful
to note, however, that the high values of the dollar acquisition rate in years 1 and 2 are driven by
extremely high conditional dollar acquisition rates in the second half of the 1990s. For instance, when we
consider year 1, the peak conditional dollar acquisition rate is in 1999 and is more than three times the
average. Similar results hold when we analyze the sample of completed acquisitions.
Though we do not report the results in a table, we also investigate the dollar amount spent by firms in
a cohort at the firm level. Given that a firm makes acquisitions for which the consideration is known, the
lifecycle pattern is similar for the median to the pattern for the cohort results of Table 3. The mean of the
cohort medians exhibits more volatility, but it has more a u-shape pattern than the monotone declining
pattern of the median.
Tables 2 and 3 show that no case can be made that mature firms are more acquisitive than young
firms. Both tables show that firms on average have peak conditional acquisition rates early in life, but the
exact timing of the peak is slightly different between the two tables. However, while there is a clear u-

12

shape pattern for the acquisition rate, the dollar acquisition rate is more variable, but is more consistent
with a monotone decreasing rate through the firm’s lifecycle. Though we do not reproduce the results in a
table, all the conclusions we reach from the data in Tables 2 and 3 hold up if we restrict the sample to
exclude financial firms and utilities.
Another way to investigate the acquisitive behavior of new firms is to look at the time that they make
their first acquisition. We compute (but do not report in a table) the fraction of firms in a cohort that have
their first acquisition in a given event year. We call this ratio the first-deal acquisition ratio. We find that
the peak year of the first-deal acquisition ratio has changed over time. In the earlier years of our sample,
the peak year of first deal acquisitions is later in the life of firms. After 1988, for all years but one, the
peak year is year 1. On average, 27% of IPO firms have their first acquisition in year 1 and 58% of IPO
firms have made an acquisition by the end of year 2. Surprisingly, 42% of first acquisitions are
diversifying acquisitions.

4. An examination of the acquisition rate of young and mature firms
In this section, we first compare the acquisition behavior of young and mature firms. Throughout the
paper we call young firms those firms that are in the first three complete calendar years after their IPO,
and mature firms those that are in years 10 to 20 from their IPO. We also estimate multiple regression
models that investigate the determinants of the conditional acquisition rate of young, middle-aged, and
mature firms. In the second part of this section, we explore in greater detail the nature of the acquisition
spike in year one. Finally, we investigate whether the results are explained by differences in the age since
incorporation of firms that go public. Though we primarily focus on the conditional acquisition rate, we
also report results for the conditional dollar acquisition rate as well. Throughout the section, we discuss
results for the whole sample as well as for the completed acquisitions sample.

13

4.1. Comparing the conditional acquisition rate of young and mature firms
We now compare in Table 4 the conditional acquisition rate of young firms and mature firms. We
construct the average conditional acquisition rate for young and mature firms by averaging across cohorts
for an event year and then averaging across event years. Table 4 has results for the whole sample as well
as for the sample of completed acquisitions.
There is no significant difference in the average conditional acquisition rate of young firms and the
average conditional acquisition rate of mature firms. It is common in the IPO literature to distinguish
between hot and cold IPO markets. The literature has a number of different ways to make that distinction.
We use the approach of Helwege and Liang (2004). To define hot and cold IPO markets, they use the
three-month moving average of the number of IPOs scaled by new business formations for each month.
They define the top quartile of that measure to correspond to hot IPO months and the bottom tercile to
correspond to cold IPO months. There is no difference in the acquisition activity between firms that go
public in hot IPO markets versus firms that go public in cold IPO markets.
We consider next the relation between underpricing and the acquisition rate. If greater underpricing
means that firms are more favored by the market, firms with more underpricing should command more
resources and hence be able to carry out more acquisitions. Alternatively, if greater underpricing means
that a firm received too little cash for its IPO, then we should see the opposite result. We show results for
the conditional acquisition rate for quintiles of first-day returns, where the quintiles are computed within
cohorts. We see that for both samples there is no difference in the acquisition rate between the various
quintiles of first-day returns for young firms. However, there is some evidence that firms that have the
lowest IPO first-day returns are less acquisitive when they become mature. Further, the conditional
acquisition rate falls significantly for the firms in the lowest quintile of first-day returns, but not for the
firms in the other quintiles. We also re-calculated the quintiles without dividing the sample into IPO
cohorts and the results are qualitatively the same. To evaluate the relation between the level of mergers
and acquisitions activity in the economy and the conditional acquisition rate of the IPO cohorts, we
consider separately the merger/IPO wave years of the 1990s and the other years. We date the merger/IPO

14

wave from 1995, the year of the Netscape IPO, to 2000, the year of the collapse of the internet boom. We
see that the difference between the conditional acquisition rate of young firms and mature firms is
dramatic for the 1990s merger/IPO wave years. However, there is no difference between these conditional
acquisition rates when these years are excluded. Further, the rate of acquisition activity of young firms is
much higher during the 1990s merger/IPO wave years than in other years. There is no difference in these
results between the sample of all acquisitions and the sample of completed acquisitions.
Figures 2 and 3 provide further importance on the importance of merger activity for the acquisitive
behavior of IPO firms. In Figure 2, we plot the mean conditional acquisition rate per event year for the
whole sample, for the event years during the merger/IPO wave of the 1990s, for the other years, as well as
for whether a firm goes public in a hot or cold IPO market. Figure 3 shows the medians instead. It is
extremely clear from these plots that there is a sharp difference in the acquisitive behavior of firms early
in their public life if the market for acquisitions is very active or not.
Turning to the characteristics of the acquisitions, we first estimate a conditional acquisition rate for
acquisitions in the firm’s two-digit SIC code industry, which we call related acquisitions, as well as a
conditional acquisition rate for other acquisitions, which we call diversifying acquisitions. We find that
there is no difference in the extent to which mature firms make diversifying acquisitions compared to
young firms. However, there is a significant difference in the extent to which mature firms make public
acquisitions as mature firms make more public acquisitions than young firms. The fraction of acquisitions
that are private firm acquisitions is lower for mature firms than for young firms. In contrast, mature firms
acquire more subsidiaries than young firms. It is clear from the data presented about the organizational
form of the target that acquisitions of public firms are a small minority of all acquisitions. Lastly, we
consider how the acquisition is paid for. Young firms have a higher rate of acquisitions paid for with
stock than mature firms. Not surprisingly, therefore, the fraction of acquisitions that are in cash is
significantly higher for mature firms. It is important, however, not to forget that data on how acquisitions
are paid for is missing for a majority of acquisitions. We investigate, but do not report in the table,
whether the results for how acquisitions are paid for differ depending on whether a firm goes public in a

15

hot IPO market or a cold IPO market. We find that the proportion of acquisitions that are paid for with
stock is significantly higher for firms that go public in a hot IPO market than for firms that go public in a
cold IPO market.
We turn next to a comparison of the conditional dollar acquisition rate. We show the results in Table
5. The sample used for this table excludes all deals of firms with at least one missing transaction value. As
for Table 4, we show results for all acquisitions and then for completed acquisitions only. There is no
significant difference in the conditional dollar acquisition rate between young and mature firms for the
whole sample, but there is a significant difference for the sample of completed acquisitions. Using the
sample of completed acquisitions, mature firms spend less on acquisitions than young firms. However,
young firms that go public in a hot market have a higher conditional acquisition rate than young firms that
go public in a cold market. Further, the greater expenditure on acquisitions of young firms occurs only for
young firms that go public in a hot market for the sample of completed acquisitions. We consider next the
conditional dollar acquisition rate for the quintiles of first-day returns. As with the results for the
conditional acquisition rate, we see that firms that have the lowest first-day return experience a stark drop
in their conditional dollar acquisition rate when they mature. Finally, we again split the sample into the
merger/IPO wave of the 1990s and the other years. Outside of the merger wave of the 1990s, there is no
evidence that young firms acquire at a higher rate than mature firms.
Looking at the extent to which firms undertake diversifying acquisitions, we find that young firms
spend more than old firms on related acquisitions, but not on diversifying acquisitions. Young firms
spend much more on acquisitions of private firms than mature firms. There is no difference in the
spending on acquisitions of public firms between young and mature firms. The conditional dollar
acquisition rate is not significantly different for young and mature firms for different means of payments;
however, the fraction of acquisitions financed with cash is significantly higher for mature firms than for
young firms.
We investigate whether the results discussed so far in this section differ if we restrict the sample to
exclude financial firms and utilities. There are no meaningful differences between the results.

16

We now use multiple regressions to understand how market characteristics as well as cohort
characteristics affect cohort event-year conditional acquisition rates and dollar acquisition rates. The
advantage of the regression framework is that we can evaluate the relation between conditional
acquisition rates accounting for the correlations among explanatory variables of interest and that we can
use continuous explanatory variables.
Table 6 shows regression estimates using cohort-event-year conditional acquisition rates as the
dependent variable. We report results for the whole sample. Results for the completed acquisitions
subsample are similar. We eliminate all cohort years with less than 20 firms. The first regression has a
constant and two indicator variables. The indicator variables are one variable for whether the firms in the
cohort are in the period of 4-9 years (middle-aged firms) after the IPO and one variable for whether the
firms are more than ten years from their IPO. We use robust standard errors with clustering on IPO
cohorts. We confirm that the conditional acquisition rate in event time follows a u-shape pattern. The
intercept, corresponding to the conditional acquisition rate of young firms, is 0.5. The coefficient for
mature firms is an insignificant -0.04, so that mature firms and young firms have the same conditional
acquisition rate. However, the coefficient on middle-aged firms is -0.13 and is significant at the 5% level.
Middle-aged firms are therefore less acquisitive than young and mature firms. We test explicitly for the ushape pattern by comparing the acquisition rate of young versus middle-aged firms and middle-aged firms
versus mature firms. We find significant differences at the 5% consistent with a u-shape.
The next regression adds an indicator for the hot merger/IPO market of 1995-2000 to regression (1).
We find that the indicator variable is significant and positive in regression (2), but it does not change the
inferences from regression (1). Instead of using the indicator variable for the hot merger/IPO market, we
construct an index of M&A activity. The index is constructed by dividing the total number of acquisitions
in SDC by the number of active firms in Compustat. That variable, in regression (3), is significant as well.
However, adding that variable has no impact on the other coefficient estimates. In regression (4), we add
indicator variables for whether the firm went public in a hot or cold IPO market to regression (2). These
indicator variables are not significant. In regression (5), we add to regression (2) the lagged M&A index

17

and the mean first-day IPO return for the cohort. Neither of these variables is significant. However, these
variables affect the coefficients of the first two indicator variables as their absolute value increases and
the coefficient on mature firms becomes negative and significant. In regression (6), we add to regression
(2) the variables we introduced in regressions (4) and (5). None of these variables are significant. For
regression (7), we create an indicator variable for whether the index of M&A activity is above its sample
average. In the regression, we add that index and interact it with the index for the age of the firm. While
the index is not significant, there is now evidence that the higher conditional acquisition rate of young
firms is due to the periods of intense M&A activity. In periods where M&A activity is below average,
mature firms acquire more. Regression (7) has marginal evidence that multicollinearity might be a
problem using the VIF index. Regression (8) is similar to regression (7) except we use an indicator
variable for the merger/IPO boom of the second half of the 1990s instead of an indicator variable for the
M&A index being above average. With this specification, multicollinearity is not a problem, but the
inferences are the same as for regression (7).
We also estimated regressions like those of Table 6 for the dollar acquisition rate. These results are
reproduced in Table 7. We find that middle-aged firms and mature firms spend less on acquisitions than
young firms in regression (1). Not surprisingly, spending on acquisitions is much higher during the
merger wave of the 1990s. Outside of high merger activity periods, young firms do not spend more on
mergers than more mature firms.

4.2. The conditional acquisition rate of firms up to year 4
As discussed in Section 3, firms that go public in the 1990s have a spike in the conditional acquisition
rate in the first year after the IPO. We examine the conditional acquisition rate by year for young firms.
The intent is to understand how the conditional acquisition rate evolves for young firms as their IPO
becomes more distant and whether this evolution differs depending on the state of the IPO market and of
the M&A market.

18

Table 8 reports estimates of the conditional acquisition rate for years 0 to 4 for various subsamples.
As in Tables 4 and 5, we report results for the whole sample as well as for the sample of completed
acquisitions. The conditional acquisition rate in year 4 is 56.52% of the year 1 rate. A similar result holds
for the completed acquisition sample. There is no significant difference in conditional acquisition rates
between firms that go public in hot and cold markets in any of the first four years of their public life. The
conditional acquisition rate in year 4 is 51.29% of the year 1 rate for hot market IPOs and 55.95% for cold
market IPOs. However, the conditional acquisition rate falls significantly from year 1 to year 4 for
acquisitions by firms that had their IPO in a hot market, but not by firms that had an IPO in a cold market.
The spike in year 1 holds for all quintiles of underpricing for the whole sample, but it is not
significant for the first quintile. However, there is no significant difference in acquisition rates between
the first and fifth quintile. Though we do not report the results in the table, we also investigate conditional
acquisition rates for quintile of first-day returns computed across all acquisitions. We find similar results.
Since underpricing varies across hot and cold markets, we investigate (but do not report in the table) the
relation between underpricing and acquisition activity separately for hot and cold markets. We find no
statistically significant difference in conditional acquisition rates across underpricing quintiles between
firms that IPO in hot and cold markets.
In both samples, the year one spike is dramatic for the merger/IPO wave of the 1990s. The rate of
acquisition in year one is more than three times higher during the merger/IPO wave. Not surprisingly, the
rate of acquisition is significantly higher each year during the merger wave than in other years. Finally,
the year one acquisition rate is significantly higher during the merger wave but not for the sample that
excludes the years from the merger wave.
We turn next to the characteristics of the acquisitions of young firms. We discussed in the
introduction the literature which suggests that firms make diversifying acquisitions as their investment
opportunities disappear in their industry. There is a spike in the acquisition rate of diversifying
acquisitions in year 1 as well. In year 1, firms have a conditional acquisition rate of 0.25 outside their
industry. This rate falls over time so that the acquisition rate outside the industry is 0.16 in year 4. As a

19

proportion of the acquisitions, the fraction of diversifying acquisitions increases from year 1 to year 4, but
not significantly. 39% of the acquisitions in year 1 are diversifying acquisitions when we use the whole
sample of acquisitions; by year 4, 44% of the acquisitions are diversifying acquisitions. A similar result
holds for the sample of completed acquisitions. To further buttress the point that firms make diversifying
acquisitions early in life, it is striking that 40% of the acquisitions in the year of the IPO are diversifying
acquisitions.
We saw earlier that young firms mostly acquire private firms and subsidiaries. For the sample as a
whole, there is no evidence of a spike in year 1 for acquisitions of public firms. When we compare IPOs
in hot and cold markets, we find similar results, though there is evidence of a spike in year 1 in the
acquisition of public firms for IPOs in hot markets (not reported). Over time, acquisitions of public firms
become more important as a fraction of all acquisitions because the acquisition rate falls for acquisitions
of private firms and subsidiaries. It follows from this that the year 1 spike in acquisitions is driven by
acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries.
Lastly, we investigate the method of payment. When the data is available, cash is used more often
than equity. However, the stock acquisition rate is not significantly higher in year one than it is in year 4.
In contrast, the cash acquisition rate is. There is no evidence, therefore, that firms use their stock to pay
for acquisitions more intensely early on in their life. The acquisition rate for stock acquisitions is 0.09 for
hot market IPOs in year 1 and is 0.05 for cold market IPOs in the same year. However, the acquisition
spike is not significant for stock acquisitions whether the firm went public in a hot market or a cold
market.
We reproduce our analysis for the acquisition rate using the dollar acquisition rate, but do not show
the results in a table. The sample is notably smaller, so that our statistical tests have limited power when
we consider subsamples. There is no evidence of a year one spike with the sample of all acquisitions. In
fact, the conditional dollar acquisition rate is the same for year 1 and year 4, 0.04. For the same sample,
we find that the conditional dollar acquisition rate is significantly higher in years 2 and 3 for firms that
IPO in a hot market than for firms that IPO in a cold market. Further, young firms spend significantly

20

more on acquisitions during the merger/IPO wave of the 1990s than in other years. Though firms make
diversifying acquisitions early in their life, we find that they spend significantly more on acquisitions in
their 2-digit SIC code. Finally, the fraction of the amount spent on acquisitions that is spent on private
firms acquisitions falls significantly from year 1 to year 4, while the fraction of the amount spent on
public acquisitions increases significantly. Though firms spend more on private firm acquisitions in year
1 than on public firm acquisitions, the ranking flips already in year 2. However, the differences in these
fractions are never significant. The results are similar using the sample of completed acquisitions, but the
significance is typically less as that sample is smaller.

4.3. The influence of the age since incorporation`
Throughout the paper so far, we have ignored the fact that firms that go public vary in age since
incorporation. We now divide our IPO firms for which we have the year of incorporation into quintiles
according to their age since incorporation at the IPO. Panel a of Table 9 shows the median age since
incorporation for each of the quintiles. There is a surprisingly wide range of age since incorporation for
the IPO firms. We turn next to an investigation of whether the conditional acquisition rate of firms since
the IPO depends on the age of incorporation of firms. For that purpose, we show in Panel b of Table 9 the
conditional rate of young and mature firms relative to their IPO for each of the quintiles of age since
incorporation. We saw for the sample as a whole in Table 4 that there is no significant difference in the
conditional acquisition rate of young and mature firms. This result (not tabulated) holds as well for each
age since incorporation quintile except for the firms in the first quintile. We find evidence significant at
the 10% level that young firms acquire more than mature firms if they are in the youngest quintile.
However, this evidence is due entirely to the merger/IPO wave years. The last panel of the table looks at
the spike in year 1. We find that the spike is significant for all age quintiles since incorporation except for
the fourth quintile. However, once more, this result (not tabulated) is driven by the merger wave of the
1990s.

21

5. The market’s reaction to acquisitions by young and mature firms
In this section, we investigate the stock-price reaction to acquisition announcements by young and
mature firms. If firms make acquisitions because of a lack of growth opportunities, we expect an
especially poor reaction to acquisitions by young firms since they just went public partly based on their
investment opportunities. If young firms make acquisitions to exploit their growth opportunities because
acquisitions are complementary to capital expenditures, there would be no reason for the market to react
adversely to acquisitions.
We estimate abnormal returns as net-of-market returns over the window [-1,+1] around the first
announcement date. Such an approach is especially appropriate for young firms since we do not have
much data to estimate a market model. It is well-known from the literature that announcement returns
differ by the type of target and by the method of payment.4 In Table 10, we therefore provide
announcement return estimates for acquisitions by young and mature firms across all combinations of
type of target and method of payment. However, only a subset of acquisitions has information on the
method of payment.
The first panel of the Table reports abnormal returns for all acquisitions. We see that for all
acquisitions, young firms have higher abnormal returns than mature firms. When we consider different
types of targets, we see that young firms have higher abnormal returns than mature firms for both
acquisitions of private targets and acquisitions of subsidiaries. There is no difference in abnormal returns
between young and mature firms for acquisitions of public firms. When we turn to acquisitions for which
the method of payment information is available, we have a much smaller sample. The results are provided
in the next panel of the Table. The results are similar to those of the first panel, but significance is lower.
We consider separately acquisitions paid for with cash and acquisitions paid for with equity. The
results are provided in Table 11. Young firms experience higher abnormal returns than mature firms for
acquisitions paid for with cash. Strikingly, young firms have higher abnormal returns than mature firms
when they acquire public firms for cash. The same result holds for subsidiaries. However, there is no
4

See, for instance, Fuller, Netter, and Stegemoller (2002).

22

significant difference for acquisitions of private firms. When we turn to acquisitions paid for with stock,
we find that for the whole sample of such acquisitions, young firms earn higher abnormal returns than
mature firms. However, this result does not hold for acquisitions of public firms with stock. For these
acquisitions, there is no difference for the mean abnormal return and for median young firms have lower
abnormal returns than mature firms.
When we use the sample of all acquisitions, we find that young firms have higher abnormal returns
for most types of acquisitions. The only case where there is any evidence that young firms have worse
abnormal returns than mature firms is for acquisitions of public firms with stock. In that case, the
evidence is present only for medians and not for means. We conduct the same investigation for the sample
of completed acquisitions and reach similar, but less strong conclusions. We do not reproduce the results
in a table. When we look at all acquisitions, young firms have significantly higher abnormal returns. This
is also the case for acquisitions paid for with equity. However, few of the differences for subsamples are
significant. Such an outcome might not be surprising as the sample of completed acquisitions is
substantially smaller than the sample of all acquisitions.
In Table 11, we separate acquisitions into diversifying and related acquisitions. To the extent that
firms diversify when they have poor internal growth opportunities, we would expect diversifying
acquisitions to signal to the market that a firm does not have good internal growth opportunities. We saw
that the only acquisitions by young firms to which the market reacts negatively are acquisitions of public
firms paid for with stock. Strikingly, this result is due to related acquisitions. The market reacts more
favorably to diversifying acquisitions by young firms paid for with stock than to related acquisitions. In
contrast, the market reacts more adversely to related acquisitions of public firms paid for with stock than
it does to diversifying acquisitions.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate the acquisition behavior of IPO cohorts through their lifecycle. We find
that the acquisition rate of IPO cohorts follows a u-shape: the acquisition rate is higher when firms are

23

young (their first three complete calendar years) and when they are mature (years ten to twenty) than
when they are middle-aged (years four to ten). This pattern is heavily influenced by the intensity of
activity in the acquisition market. During the merger/IPO of 1995 to 2000, young firms were dramatically
more acquisitive than mature firms. In contrast, in other periods, mature firms are at least as acquisitive as
young firms. However, young and mature firms differ in the type of acquisitions they make. Young firms
make more acquisitions of private firms and fewer acquisitions of public firms relative to mature firms.
Consequently, if one were to focus only on acquisitions of public firms, one would conclude that mature
firms are more acquisitive than young firms. Any theory that explains why young firms are more
acquisitive has to explain why this greater acquisition rate translates itself into more acquisitions of
private firms than of public firms.
Theories of acquisitions in the lifecycle of firms that argue that firms become acquisitive and
diversify because they run out of internal growth opportunities are inconsistent with the evidence we
present. Not only do firms acquire intensely just after they go public, so that their first acquisition is at
least as likely to be a diversifying acquisition than not, they even make diversifying acquisitions at
roughly the same rate early in their life as they do when they mature. Further, if acquisitions are made
because internal growth opportunities have vanished, we would expect the market to react adversely to
acquisitions by young firms and especially diversifying ones. However, we show that the market
generally reacts more positively to acquisitions by young firms. The exception to this result is that the
market reacts poorly to acquisitions of public firms for equity irrespective of whether a firm is young or
mature and reacts worst of all to the acquisition of related public firms paid for with equity.

Table 1. IPO sample and rate of survival
IPOs are identified using the SDC Global Issues Database. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 1975-2002, and
excludes reverse LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisition deals of the IPO
firms include all acquisitions in the SDC’s M&A database for 1981-2006. Event Year refers to the deal year with respect to the
IPO year, event year 0. The first three columns provide the IPO year, total number of IPOs in each IPO year, and the percentage
of new IPOs in each IPO year compared to the total number of IPOs in the sample. IPO proceeds are reported by the SDC Global
Issues Database and calculated as the total number of shares issued multiplied by the offer price. IPO underpricing is calculated
as the initial return (P1-P0)*100/P0, where P1 is the first-day closing stock price or bid-ask average (from CRSP) and P0 is the IPO
offer price (e.g. Dunbar and Foerster, 2008). Total Assets ($M) are reported by SDC and are measured before the IPO. All dollar
values are reported in 2004 dollars using the CPI as a deflator. IPO total assets are available for 4,244 (63%). IPO underpricing is
calculated for the 6,518 IPOs (out of 6,548) for which data are available. The post-IPO survival rate is calculated as the number
of firms alive as of January 1st of the 5th, 10th, and 20th event year over the total number of IPO firms. The last two columns
report the total number and percentage of IPO firms that survived until the end of the sample period, January 1st, 2007.

Table 3. Conditional dollar acquisition rate
IPOs are identified using the SDC Global Issues Database. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 1975-2002 and excludes reverse LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit
offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisitions of the IPO firms include all acquisitions in the SDC M&A database for 1981-2006. Event year refers to the year with
respect to the IPO year, event year 0. The conditional dollar acquisition rate is the ratio of the total consideration paid by all firms in an IPO cohort for all their deals during the
event year divided the total assets of the firms in that cohort at the beginning of the event year. Firms with missing transaction values are excluded from both the numerator and the
denominator. Deal size is reported by SDC as the transaction value, and the total asset value is obtained from the COMPUSTAT/CRSP merged database maintained by WRDS.

Table 4. Conditional acquisition rate of young versus mature firms.
IPO data and acquisition deals are obtained from SDC Platinum. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 19752002, excluding reverse LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisitions of the IPO
firms are identified using the SDC M&A database and include all acquisitions announced in 1981-2006. Event year refers to the
year relative to the IPO year, which is event year 0. The IPO market is classified as hot, cold, or neutral following Helwege and
Liang (2004). The merger/IPO boom denotes the period from 1995 to 2000. IPO underpricing is calculated as the initial return
(P1-P0)*100/P0, where P1 is the first-day closing stock price or bid-ask average (from CRSP) and P0 is the IPO offer price (e.g.
Dunbar and Foerster, 2008). The IPO underpricing quintiles are obtained using the sub-sample of 6,518 IPOs (out of 6,548) for
which we have data. The method of payment is reported by SDC for deals that are classified as having disclosed the details of the
transactions. The target’s organizational form is classified using the data available in SDC into private, public, subsidiary, and
unknown. The superscripts a,b,c denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The tests of means use
a t-statistic and the tests of proportions use a z-statistic.

Table 5. Conditional dollar acquisition rates of young versus mature firms.
IPO data and acquisition deals are obtained from SDC Platinum. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 19752002, excluding reverse LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisitions of the IPO
firms are identified using the SDC M&A database and include all acquisition deals announced in 1981-2006. Event year refers to
year with respect to the IPO year, event year 0. The conditional dollar acquisition rate is the ratio of all considerations paid for
acquisitions of a given type in a year divided by the total assets of the firms alive at the beginning of that year. The transaction
size ratio is the dollar value of acquisitions with a given characteristics divided by the dollar amount of acquisitions. Acquisition
size is reported by SDC as the transaction value, and the total asset value is obtained from the COMPUSTAT/CRSP merged
database maintained by WRDS. The IPO market is classified as hot, cold, or neutral following Helwege and Liang (2004). The
merger/IPO boom denotes the period from 1995 to 2000. IPO underpricing is calculated as the initial return (P1-P0)*100/P0,
where P1 is the first-day closing stock price or bid-ask average (from CRSP) and P0 is the IPO offer price (e.g. Dunbar and
Foerster, 2008). The IPO underpricing quintiles are obtained using the sub-sample of 6,518 IPOs (out of 6,548) for which we

Table 6. OLS regressions for conditional acquisition rate of IPO cohorts during 1975-2002
This table presents the regression coefficients for OLS regression models where the dependent variable is the conditional
acquisition rate for IPO cohorts in an event year. Observations where there are less than 20 firms alive for the IPO cohort are
excluded. The merger/IPO boom denotes the period from 1995 to 2000. M&A index is constructed by dividing the total number
of acquisitions in SDC by the number of active firms in Compustat. The IPO market is classified as hot, cold, or neutral
following Helwege and Liang (2004). IPO underpricing is calculated as the initial return (P1-P0)*100/P0, where P1 is the first-day
closing stock price or bid-ask average (from CRSP) and P0 is the IPO offer price (e.g. Dunbar and Foerster, 2008). Robust
standard errors with clustering on IPO-cohort are reported below the coefficient estimates. The superscripts a,b,c denote statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 7. OLS regressions for conditional dollar acquisition rate of IPO cohorts during 1975-2002
This table presents the regression coefficients for OLS regression models where the dependent variable is the conditional dollar
acquisition rate for IPO cohorts in an event year. Observations where there are less than 20 firms alive for the IPO cohort are
excluded. The merger/IPO boom denotes the period from 1995 to 2000. M&A index is constructed by dividing the total number
of acquisitions in SDC by the number of active firms in Compustat. The IPO market is classified as hot, cold, or neutral
following Helwege and Liang (2004). IPO underpricing is calculated as the initial return (P1-P0)*100/P0, where P1 is the first-day
closing stock price or bid-ask average (from CRSP) and P0 is the IPO offer price (e.g. Dunbar and Foerster, 2008). Robust
standard errors with clustering on IPO-cohort are reported below the coefficient estimates. The superscripts a,b,c denote statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 8. Conditional acquisition rate for the first four years after the IPO and for the IPO year
IPO and acquisition data are obtained from SDC Platinum. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 1975-2002,
excluding reverse LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisitions of the IPO firms
are identified using the SDC M&A database and include all acquisitions announced in 1981-2006. Event year refers to the year
with respect to the IPO year, event year 0. The conditional acquisition rate is the ratio of acquisitions of a given type in a year
divided by the number of firms alive at the beginning of that year. The acquisition frequency is the fraction of acquisitions that
have some characteristic. The IPO market is classified as hot, cold, or neutral following Helwege and Liang (2004). The
merger/IPO boom denotes the period from 1995 to 2000. IPO underpricing is calculated as the initial return (P1-P0)*100/P0,
where P1 is the first-day closing stock price or bid-ask average (from CRSP) and P0 is the IPO offer price (e.g. Dunbar and
Foerster, 2008). The IPO underpricing quintiles are obtained using the sub-sample of 6,518 IPOs (out of 6,548) for which we
have data. The method of payment is reported by SDC for deals that are classified as having disclosed the details of the
transactions. We also provide data on acquisitions for which SDC provides no details on the method of payment. The target’s
organizational form is classified using the data available in SDC into private, public, subsidiary, and unknown. We use t-statistics
to test for differences in mean acquisition rates and a z-statistic for differences in fractions. The superscripts a,b,c denote statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The superscript d denotes subsamples with less than 10 IPO cohorts.

Table 9. Conditional acquisition rate of firms relative to their IPO for each of the quintiles of age since incorporation
IPO and acquisition data are obtained from SDC Platinum. IPO founding dates are compiled from SDC Platinum and Professor
Jay Ritter's website. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 1975-2002 with founding dates, excluding reverse
LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisitions of the IPO firms are identified using
the SDC M&A database and include all acquisitions announced in 1981-2006. Event year refers to the year with respect to the
IPO year, event year 0. The conditional acquisition rate is the ratio of acquisitions of a given type in a year divided by the number
of firms alive at the beginning of that year. The acquisition frequency is the fraction of acquisitions that have some characteristic.
The IPO market is classified as hot, cold, or neutral following Helwege and Liang (2004). The merger/IPO boom denotes the
period from 1995 to 2000. IPO age is calculated as the number of years passed from the founding date relative to the IPO year. he
IPO age quintiles are obtained using the sub-sample of 6,301 IPOs (out of 6,518) for which we have data. We use t-statistics to
test for differences in mean acquisition rates and a z-statistic for differences in fractions. The superscripts a,b,c denote statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. The superscript d denotes subsamples with less than 10 IPO cohorts.

Table 10. Cumulative abnormal returns around acquisition announcements by young and mature firms conditional on the method of payment and organizational form
of the target
IPO and acquisition data are obtained from SDC Platinum. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 1975-2002, excluding reverse LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit
offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisitions of the IPO firms are identified using the SDC M&A database and include all acquisitions announced in 1981-2006.
Event year refers to the deal year with respect to the IPO year, event year 0. Method of payment is reported by SDC for deals that are classified as having disclosed the details of
the transactions. We also provide data on acquisition and deals rates for deals which SDC classified as ‘undisclosed’ and provided no details of the method of payment. Target’s
organizational form is classified using the data available in SDC into private, public, subsidiary, and unknown. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are calculated using the event
window of [-1,+1]. Abnormal returns are calculated net of equally-weighted market portfolio. Rows have mean, median, standard deviation, and number of observations
respectively. We use t-statistics to test for differences in mean CARs and a z-statistic for the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test of differences in median CARs. We use
superscripts a, b, c to denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

IPO and acquisition data are obtained from SDC Platinum. The IPO sample includes all initial public offerings in 1975-2002, excluding reverse LBOs, spinoffs, rights and unit
offerings, ADRs, closed-end funds, and REITs. Acquisitions of the IPO firms are identified using the SDC M&A database and include all acquisition deals announced in 19812006. Event year refers to the year with respect to the IPO year, event year 0. The conditional acquisition rate is the ratio of acquisitions of a given type in a year divided by the
number of firms alive at the beginning of that year. The IPO market is classified as hot, cold, or neutral following Helwege and Liang (2004). The merger/IPO boom period is
during 1995-2000. IPO underpricing is calculated as the initial return (P1-P0)*100/P0, where P1 is the first-day closing stock price or bid-ask average (from CRSP) and P0 is the IPO
offer price (e.g. Dunbar and Foerster, 2008). The IPO underpricing quintiles are obtained using the 6,518 IPOs (out of 6,548) for which we have data.
