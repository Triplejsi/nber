The

Covariation of Risk Prerniurrs and Expected
Future Spot Exchange Pates
ABSTRACT

Fama (1984) analyzed the variability and the covariation of risk premiums
and expected. rates of depreciation. We employ three statistical techniques
that do not suffer from a potential bias in Fama's analysis, but we

nevertheless confirm his findings. In contrast to his interpretation the
results are not necessarily at variance with the 'predictions of a theoretical

model of the risk premium. Increases in expected rates of depreciation of the
dollar relative to five foreign currencies are positively correlated with
increases in the expected profitability of purchasing these currencies in the
forward market, and risk premiums have larger variances than expected rates of
depreciation.

Although the theoretical and empirical literature on the efficiency

of the forward foreign exchange market is now quite broad, there is

anything

but consensus on the issues.

It is now well understood that

rejection of the unbiasedness hypothesis is not a rejection of market
efficiency, since a risk premium can separate the forward rate from the
expected future spot rate, but only recently has effort been directed to

the development of explicit tests of formal models of the risk premium.
The empirical success of the.se models can only be judged as limited.1

In a recent paper, however, Eugene Fama (1984) has noted that by
viewing the forward premium as the expected rate of depreciation of thedomestic currency relative to the foreign currency plus a risk premium,, it

is possible to estimate empirically the degree of variation of the risk
premii.un over time and also to learn about the covariation of the risk
premium with the expected rate of depreciation.

In particular, Faina found

that the covariance of these two variables is negative and sufficiently
large to imply that the variance of the risk premium exceeds that of the

expected rate of depreciation.

He states (p.327), "A good story for negative covariation

between

Farna also found the results somewhat

(the risk premium) and E(Sti —

S)

(the expected rate of

depreciation) is difficult to tell."

In Section I, we investigate the plausibility, of the finding of
negative covariation.

We first argue that it is intuitively plausible

before investigating whether the intuitive reasoning is supported by the
general equilibrium model developed by Lucas (1982).

Fama (198) noted

that the Lucas model might be used for this purpose, but he did not pursue
the

analysis.

We show that a sufficient condition for negative

covariation is that the

covariance

between the ratio of

expected

nominal

marginal rates of substitution of the two currencies and the expected
ratio of the nominal marginal rates of substitution be negative. Since it

is difficult to determine the sign or magnitude of this expression in
general, we

examine a second—order approximation to the expression. Based

on this approximation, it appears that the covartance of the risk premium

and the expected rate of depreciation can be positive only if tile

covariance between the iriterternporal nominal marginal rates of

substitution of the two currencies is large and positive. Since the
analysis based on the approximation is not entirely satisfactory, we
provide an example based on Cobb—Douglas utility functions arid
conditionally

lognormal exogenous processes in

which the covariarice is

indeed negative. This example economy is exactly

the type of environment

in which Fama claims to find difficulty justifying negative covariation.

t has complete markets and flexible goods prices that satisfy purchasing
power parity.

Fama's other empirical result, that the variance of the risk premium

is greater than the variance of the expected rate of depreciation, also
seems to be an important result.

It is significant because it implies

that a time—varying risk premium plays a fundamental role in the
determination of spot and forward exchange rates.

In contrast, most

theoretical rational expectations models of exchange

rate determination

have focused almost exclusively on the expected rate of depreciation.
This finding suggests that future work be devoted to understanding the
importance of risk in foreign exchange markets.

Because of the potential importance of these findings, it is
essential to investigate whether the statistical procedures employed in

Fama's analysis are correct.

Under the

hypothesis that there is a

time—varying risk premium, there is reason to suspect that the standard
errors reported by Fama are somewhat biased.

In

Section

II, we

investigate the source of the bias which arises from the presence of weak
serial correlation, and we argue that Fama's estimates, while biased, are

probably not severely biased. We then provide alternative techniques for

testing the hypothesis of negative covariation that are robust to the
presence of serial correlation, and we find that our statistical analysis
supports Fama's results.

Concluding remarks and some qualifications of our analysis are
contained in Section III.

The empirical results contained in Fama (1984) demonstrate that the

Consequently, the empirical results tell us that when there is an increase

in the expected rate of depreciation of the U.S. dollar- relative to the
foreign currency, i.e. Et(St÷i —

increases, there is a decrease in

the expected profit froni buying U.S. dollars in the forward market, i.e.
falls.

At an intuitive level this covariation may seem puzzling, since one
might argue that the higher the expected depreciation of the dollar, the

higher

might be the required expected nominal return on a dollar

denominated security. However, the risk premium in the empirical work is
the expected profit from purchasing dollars forward. Hence, the expected
profit is riot dollar denominated; it is denominated in foreign currency.

demonstrate how the Lucas framework can be extended to price forward
contracts. A central idea in such intertemporal asset pricing frameworks
is that nominal risk free bills in the domestic arid foreign currencies are

priced such that the inverse of the known nominal return is equal to the
conditional expectation of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution

of the currency.

When this is true, the foregone marginal utility of

holding a one period bill is equal to the expected discounted marginal
utility of the return on the bill.

though it is riot a risk premium.

Risk aversion magnifies the above

deviation of Ft from Et(St1). Given (20), our empirical findings as well
as Fama's findings can have an interpretation even with risk neutrality.

We prefer to call any deviation a risk premium because of the large
differences that characterize other expected asset returns. This evidence
has strongly conditioned our prior beliefs regarding agents' risk aversion.

II. The

Empirical Analysis

In this section we analyze whether the empirical technique used by

Fama (19814) in his analysis of this issue is appropriate.

Since the

empirical analysis is relevant to any market containing spot and forward
rates, it is desirable that estimators with correct properties are used.
We argue here that some serial correlation may be present in the residuals
of Fama's ordinary least squares and seemingly unrelated regressions which

would potentially bias the standard errors. Since it appears in this case

that

the degree of the bias is not particularly severe, we do not

investigate it formally.

Instead, we discuss several econometric

approaches to this issue that do not suffer from this potential. bias.

As in the theoretical analysis, let. Ft and S denote the forward and
spot exchange rates, and let

be the risk premium.. Both exchange rates

are measured in domestic currency (U.S. dollars) per unit of foreign
currency.

The risk premium is defined to be the expected profit from

selling the foreign currency forward which is equivalent to buying U.S.
dollars forward.

Market efficiency in the presence of a risk premium

therefore implies

Farna (198L) did not find much evidence against the null

hypothesis of no serial correlation in the autocorrelatioris of the
residuals of equations like (27) using standard statistical tests, but

have statistically significant explanatory power in predicting future spot
rates in equations like (27). Thus, it seems that the residuals of (27)
may be characterized by weak serial correlation which could bias Fama's
standard errors.

At this point there are two questions to be addressed. One is why do

the residuals of (27) satisfy standard tests for serial correlation.

A

second related question is if there is statistically significant serial
correlation but standard tests cannot detect it, is there significant bias
in the estimation.

In addressing the first question consider the figures reported in
Table

1

that are taken from Fama's (1984) Table 1.

The standard

statistical test for serial correlation compares autocorrelation
coefficients to an asymptotic standard error which is 1/ Jf where T is the
sample size.

With a sample of ten years of monthly data, the standard

error is approximately .09.

Hence, an autocorrelation coefficient raust

traditional levels. Iotice that none of the first order autocorrelatioris
is greater than .18.

Notice also that the

series are highly significantly different from

Since these variables are statistically significant in regressions

like (27), we know that there is a statistically meaningful expected rate:

of change in exchange rates.

However, applying the ii.f test to the

residuals will riot reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation

because the residuals also contain the unanticipated change in the
exchange rate, ri1. Based on the regressions in Hodrick and

Srivastava

(1984) in which a set o forward premiums was statistically significant in
it is entirely plausible to conjecture that- the residuals

explaining

in equations like (27) contain approximatley the same

amount of

residual

serial correlation as the raw series used as the dependent variables.

It

is also plausible based on the statistics in Table 1 to consider that the

variance of n1, the unanticipated change of the exchange rate, is
perhaps 50 to 100 times the variance of the projection error, 1L.

Thus,

in this case it seems unlikely that the bias is very severe.

II.A. The GMM Alternative

Rather than investigate the severity of the bias directly, which is
cumbersome and quite difficult in the case of stochastic regressors that

simply predetermined variables, we investigate three alternative
strategies of analysis.
First, we consider estimation of the parameters in (27) as a problem
in Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). In this case we

Rather than extend

the analysis in the direction of seemingly unrelated regressions as was

desire to develop a inultivariate analogue to (27) that does not impose the

assumption of no serial correlation in the residuals provides the
motivation for our second additional test. Unfortunately, the coefficient

of the

own forward premium does not decompose as in (28) if more

regressors are added to (27-).

We turn next to a formal description of our alternative statistical

Mote that the first case examines whether a covariance of two

arbitrarily serially correlated time series is negative while the second

case tests whether the difference of two variances is negative.
Hypothesis testing in these cases requires the distribution of sample
variances and covariances, and these are derived and estimated by using
some elementary spectral analysis.

The procedures followed here are

similar to those employed by Meese and Singleton (1980) and Singleton
(1980).

Valid inference about the hypothesis that

the true covariance is negative can be conducted as a one—sided test of
the null hypothesis

Rf3(0) > 0 using the normal distribution described

above.

The series were first subjected to Fourier transformation, and the
periodogram was computed at 120 equally spaced frequencies. The spectral

densities were then obtained by smoothing the periodogram ordinates using

a Daniell window of width 7.

This smoothing procedure was deemed

satisfactory in that the estimates of the covariances obtained by
integrating (summing) the estimated spectral densities were quite close to

those computed directly. The results of our one—sided test are presented

in Table 3.

As can be seen, the sample covariance between the forward

premium and the actual rate of change of the spot rate is negative for all

five currencies, significantly so for the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc,

and the U.K. pound. While riot an identical test to our 3MM estimation,
this first alternative produces basically the same statistical results.

Additional Test 2

As indicated previously, the second test relies on a comparison of

the variance of the forward premium with the variance of the estimated
rate of change of the spot rate, E(S+1). If

is negative for all five currencies in our sample.

iii. Conclusions
The primary purpose of this paper has been to investigate the
covariation of the risk premium in the forward foreign exchange market and

the expected rate of depreciation of the U.S.
other currencies. Using alternative statistical

is negatively

The risk premium, when

defined this way, is the expected return to purchasing dollars in the:
forward market. The expected return to selling dollars or buying foreign
currency forward therefore covaries positively with the expected. rate of

depreciation of the dollar relative to all

five

foreign currencies..

Although Farna (19814) found such a covariation puzzling and potentially

inconsistent with economic theory, we have demonstrated that it is
intuitively plausible and consistent with the prediction of the

Lucas

(1982) model.

The magnitude of the covariance also indicated that the variance of

the risk premium is greater than the variance of the expected rate of
depreciation.

Since rational expectations models of spot exchange rate

determination have focused almost exclusively on the latter term, this

quantitative finding suggests that more work ought to be devoted to
determining how risk affects the determination of spot exchange rates.

Of course, this analysis as well as Fama's and all modern rational
expectations time series analysis relies on the statistical assumptions of

and ergodicity. Krasker (1980) has argued that these
assumptions nay be incorrect in such analyses. Agents may care about
stationaritY

events that have not occurred in the sample, and the probability of these

events may fluctuate.9

Developing estimation methods to handle these

problems may riot be as critical as determining what the factors actually
are.

Fatna's Section 5 offers some alternative interpretations of the data

that certainly demand some consideration.

First, it is, of course,

possible that the market is inefficient, although this hypothesis receives

virtually no support in studies of other financial markets.

A second

alternative is attributed to Richard Roll who apparently suggested that a

government may obstinately force appreciation of a currency precisely in
those periods during which market forces are predicting depreciation.

If

the unbiasedness hypothesis were true, such a finding could only be

consistent with the data if governments could
public.

Hence, we also give little credence to this explanation in a

rational world.
Mussa.

consistently -fool the

Fama's third possible explantion was offered by Michael

He argued that these markets may be characterized by periods of

brief skewness in the distribution of future exchange rates due to
uncertainty in the direction of government policy.

Without sufficient

draws from these changing distributions, it is possible that ex post
changes in exchange rates are consistently below their ex ante means which

creates negative small sample covariation between the forward premium
under the unbiasedness hypothesis and the actual rate of depreciation.1°
Tackling these problems of heteroscedasticity and changing skewness in the

distributions of returns requires larger samples arid explicit
incorporation of additional theory regarding the linkage between the

determination of exchange rates and government policies.

This is

certainly a fertile area for additional theoretical and empirical analysis.

for extensive references to the empirical and theoretical literature

on the subject. See also Frankel (1982), Domowitz and Hakkio (1985),
Korajczyk (1985), and Mark (1985) for tests of alternative
specifications of risk premiums.

2.

This

specification of the Lucas model has been criticized because the

determination of the exchange rate lacks a forward looking component.
The problem arises because the timing of trades in securities and
goods makes the demand for money insensitive to the nominal interest

rate. Alternative ways of overcoming this problem are discussed in
Lucas and Stokey (1983) and Svensson fl983).

3. Domowitz and Hakkio (1985) employ these distributional assumptions in
their analysis.

Fama (198L) specified his analysis in natural logarithms. Since

—

[(St1 —

3t)/st]

and ln(Ft) —
and [(Ft —

S)/S]

are very nearly equal to
and have almost perfect

correlation, it is highly unlikely that statistically significant
differences would separate the results.

5. The data were supplied by Data Resources, Inc. They are a nonover—
lapping sample beginning in July 1973 and ending in September 1983 in
which Tuesday forward rates predict Thursday spot rates 30 days in the
future with the next observation being the following Friday forward

rate predicting a corresponding Monday spot rate. Hakkio (1983)
argues correctly that the future spot rates do not match the precise

value day that is specified by a forward contract. Fama (1984) used
the Harris Bank data treating a Friday forward rate as predicting a
Friday spot rate four weeks in the future which is also incorrect.

Thus, our data contain slight measurement errors. Riehi and Rodriguez
(1977) discuss the rules that regulate the execution of a forward
contract. Meese and Singleton (1980), Hsieh (19814), and Cumby and
Obstfeld (19814) match the data more precisely than here, and they find

very little difference in inference regarding evidence against the
unbiasedness hypothesis.

3.

Anderson (1971, p. 593) establishes conditions under which the sample
variances have limiting normal distributions despite the fact that 9

is estimated. Our analysis is valid given these regularity conditions.

9. Tests of excess volatility of stock prices relative to dividends as in
Shiller (1981) are subject to the same critique although the problem

is much broader than just these financial studies. All rational
expectations estimation techniques require that large sample moments

correspond to the moments of the true distributions. If this is not
the case because drastic events have not occurred with sufficent
frequency, then the studies make an error.

10. It is interesting to note that evidence of negative covariation can be
found in Bilson (1931) who broke the forward premium into small and
larger values on the basis of whether they were smaller or larger than

10 percent at an annual rate. His seemingly unrelated regression

= .25 f3 — .23
(15)
(.12)
indicates

that the negative

coefficient in equations like (27) may

be due to extreme values in the data which supports Mussa's conjecture
since relatively few of these large values occurred during the sample.
