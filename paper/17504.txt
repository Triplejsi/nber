ABSTRACT
Policy debates about the balance of vocational and general education programs focus on the school-to-work
transition. But with rapid technological change, gains in youth employment from vocational education
may be offset by less adaptability and thus diminished employment later in life. To test our main hypothesis
that any relative labor-market advantage of vocational education decreases with age, we employ a
difference-in-differences approach that compares employment rates across different ages for people
with general and vocational education. Using micro data for 18 countries from the International Adult
Literacy Survey, we find strong support for the existence of such a trade-off, which is most pronounced
in countries emphasizing apprenticeship programs. Results are robust to accounting for ability patterns
and to propensity-score matching.

1. Introduction
Most advanced economies are concerned about the ease with which young workers can
make the transition from school to work. The unemployment rate for youth invariably exceeds
that for the economy as a whole, contributing to a variety of social problems. In addition, many
young workers struggle to find their place in the labor force, changing not only employers but
also occupations multiple times before they settle down to stable jobs. One appealing way to
deal with this transition problem is to link students more closely to jobs through vocational
education programs and through apprenticeships with firms (see Ryan (2001)). Moreover, the
potential for improving youth labor markets in this manner has considerable political support
around the world. This study takes a broader perspective on vocational education programs. In
contrast to previous research that has focused almost entirely on the school-to-work transition of
youth, this paper studies the difference in life-cycle work experience – employment, wages, and
career-related training – between individuals receiving vocational and general education.
Countries have actually adopted very different schooling structures that differ
fundamentally in their focus on the job transition. Some stress vocational education that
develops specific job-related skills in order to prepare students to work in specific occupations,
while others emphasize general education that provides students with broad knowledge and basic
skills in mathematics and communication and serves as the foundation for further learning and
on-the-job training. The United States, for example, has largely eliminated vocational education
as a separate track in secondary schools on the argument that specific skills become obsolete too
quickly and that it is necessary to give people the ability to adapt to new technologies. On the
other hand, many European and developing countries, led by Germany’s “dual system,” provide
extensive vocational education and training at the secondary level – sometimes with direct
involvement of industry through apprenticeships. The underlying rationale is that by
1

concentrating on specific vocational skills, it is possible to improve the entry of workers into the
economy and to make them productive at an earlier point.
These differing perspectives suggest a possible trade-off between short-term and longterm costs and benefits for both individuals and the entire society: The skills generated by
vocational education may facilitate the transition into the labor market but may later on become
obsolete at a faster rate. Our main hypothesis is thus that any initial labor-market advantage of
vocational relative to general education decreases with age. This argument is related to the
macroeconomic perspective of Krueger and Kumar (2004a, 2004b) who have argued that the
propensity to use vocational rather than general education may be an underlying cause of
growth-rate differentials between the U.S. and Europe. The argument is simply that vocational
(“skill-based”) as opposed to general (“concept-based”) education leads to slower adoption of
new technologies. While similar notions underlie our work here, we are really interested in the
other side of the relationship: If there is rapid technological and structural change, what does
this mean for hiring workers with vocational and general education?
The existing empirical analysis of the impact of educational type on individuals is fairly
limited and provides mixed information about either the existence or magnitude of our
hypothesized trade-off. The general-vocational education debate has centered on whether
vocational education is effective in facilitating youth school-to-work transition.1 However, even
at job entry, existing studies have not found a universal advantage of vocational over academic
education for youth’s labor-market outcomes, although the analysis has been problematic.2 As

1

Another larger literature focuses on the firm side of the market and their incentives to invest in general or specific
education; see the initial work by Becker (1964) and more recent analysis by Acemoglu and Pischke (1998, 1999).
2
For examples, see Arum and Shavit (1995); Malamud and Pop-Eleches (2010); and the reviews in Ryan (2001) and
Wolter and Ryan (2011). Oosterbeek and Webbink (2007) and Fersterer, Pischke, and Winter-Ebmer (2008) are
recent examples studying the labor-market outcomes of vocational education.

2

Paul Ryan (2001) states: “The merits of vocational curricula and work-based preparation are
particularly difficult to evaluate statistically, given the potential importance of selection around
unobservables, the near-absence of experimental evidence, and the paucity of prior labor market
experience to use in econometric modeling” (p. 73).
Studying the life-cycle implications of vocational education thus presents a number of
challenges. First, as noted in the job-entry studies, people entering various kinds of vocational
education may differ systematically from those entering general education. Second,
investigating life-cycle outcomes requires comparing individuals of different ages, but ensuring
that the workers of one age cohort are otherwise similar to those of another cohort is difficult. At
the very least, sufficiently detailed information on individuals is required to check the validity of
any melding of information across age groups. A third issue that we must face revolves around
varying definitions of programs and of institutions (see, for example, the discussion in Mansuy et
al. (2001)). The definition of vocational education is not consistent across countries, so what one
country calls vocational education may be very different from that of another even when the
underlying institutional structure appears similar. As such, many of the existing analyses
actually compare very different kinds of programs including various kinds of school-based
training, firm-based training, and apprenticeships. Thus, understanding the importance of
different kinds of programs suggests a necessity of comparison of effects across different types
of countries.
This paper employs an international sample of labor-market outcomes for workers across
the age spectrum, using micro data from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). The
database is unique because it provides detailed information about the education and skills of
workers across the life-cycle in countries with varying structures of vocational schooling and

3

training. To address the concern of selection into different types of education, we propose a
difference-in-differences framework, comparing labor-market outcomes across different ages for
people with general and vocational education. We further address the remaining concern that
selectivity into education types might have changed over time by accounting for individual-level
measures of ability and of family background, as well as country-specific changes in the size and
ability composition of the different education types over cohorts. We also employ propensityscore matching to reduce concerns of selectivity further.
Starting with a sample pooling individuals from 18 countries, we find that individuals
with general education initially face worse employment outcomes but experience improved
employment probability as they become older relative to individuals with vocational education.
When we conduct the estimation for each country separately, the estimates, however, vary
noticeably across countries. In the U.S. and other countries without a noteworthy vocational
education system, the employment probability of individuals with different types of education
does not vary with age at all, whereas in most of the European countries in the sample, the ageemployment pattern differs and sometimes quite significantly between individuals with general
and vocational education. The pattern is most pronounced in the well-known apprenticeship
countries of Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. In these countries, the easier entry into the
labor market is balanced by noticeably greater withdrawal at older ages.
One reason underlying the estimated employment pattern for the “apprenticeship
countries” seems to be adult training. With increasing age, individuals with general education
are more likely to take any career-related training and receive more hours of career-related
training relative to those with vocational education, giving them the opportunity to continue
updating their skills to be employed in a changing economy.

4

Policy judgments about the efficacy of vocational education and apprenticeships depend
of course on the balance between early-career and late-career costs and benefits. The life-cycle
wage patterns by education type are remarkably similar in most countries, suggesting that the
primary determinant of differences in lifetime earnings is the life-cycle employment pattern.
Preliminary results about lifetime earnings are mixed for the apprenticeship countries, with
apprenticeships having a positive return in Switzerland but not in Denmark and Germany.
Interestingly, this pattern matches the growth pattern of these economies over past decades.
In the following, Section 2 introduces the database and Section 3 the empirical model.
Section 4 presents the main results on employment impacts of education types, and Section 5
analyzes heterogeneity across countries. Section 6 presents results on impacts of education types
on adult education and wages. Section 7 weighs early against late labor-market experience in a
calculation of individual lifetime earnings, and Section 8 concludes.

2. Data
To investigate our primary hypothesis, we require data about education type and about
employment patterns over the life-cycle. But, more than that, we need sufficient detail about the
labor-market skills of individuals so that we can identify the impact of education type on
employment rates in the face of individual selection into schooling programs.
2.1 The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS)
Our primary data source, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS),3 provides a
unique opportunity to investigate the impact of education type.4 Conducted in the participating

follow-on – the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) – is currently in
process.

countries between 1994 and 1998, IALS provides us with data for 18 countries, including 15
European countries plus the U.S., New Zealand, and Chile.5 The IALS contains information
about respondents’ years of schooling and whether they completed a vocational program or
general program in secondary and post-secondary education for a representative sample of adults
between 16 and 65 years of age in each country. Obviously, average educational attainment
varies across countries and over time (see Appendix Table A1), which is the topic of an
extensive literature already, but what we are most interested in here is the distinction between
general and vocational programs.
While other datasets may also record employment patterns for different age cohorts, a
key element of the IALS is its extensive data on other individual employment-related
characteristics including age, gender, years of schooling, employment status, earnings, adult
training, parents’ educational attainment, and, for a subset of countries, father’s occupation.
Additionally, each individual was given a series of assessments of cognitive skills (called
“literacies”) that are comparable within and across countries. The literacy tests in prose,
document, and quantitative domains are designed to measure basic skills needed to participate
fully in modern society. As discussed in Hanushek and Zhang (2009), the test scores appear to
be a reasonable index of general levels of skills. These detailed individual measures are
important in investigating any changes across time in the selectivity of general and vocational
programs.
For the empirical analysis, we restrict our sample to individuals who completed at least
secondary education and who are currently not students. This is the sample on which general

and vocational education types can be defined for individuals’ final schooling level. We also
restrict our analysis to males, because of their stable aggregate labor-force participation patterns
in prime-age groups across most countries in our sample. This circumvents concerns about
cohort-specific selection into work by females.
For individuals who finished secondary education, a general education is defined if their
education program is academic or college preparatory; a vocational education is defined if their
education program is business, trade, or vocational. Some individuals report their education type
as secondary-level equivalency or simply as “other”; since it is not clear what exactly these
programs entail, we classify this as a separate category.6 For individuals who finished the first
stage of tertiary education, a general program is one that leads to a university degree (BA/BS),
and a vocational program is one that does not lead to a university degree.7
2.2 Descriptive Patterns
Tables 1 and 2 show the overall distribution of education types by country and by age
group. On average, 35 percent of males in our sample completed a general education and 47
percent completed a vocational education (the remainder being in the residual “other” category).
Of the 73 percent of individuals in our sample whose final education is at the secondary level,
about one quarter completed a general education and one half a vocational education. More than
half of those completing a tertiary education finished with a bachelor’s degree.

6

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2010), at the secondary level,
general programs are programs that are not designed explicitly to prepare participants for a specific class of
occupations or trades or for entry into further vocational or technical education programs, while vocational
education prepares participants for direct entry, without further training, into specific occupations.
7
We essentially define the tertiary type-A programs as general education and tertiary type-B programs as
vocational. The former are largely theory-based and are designed to provide sufficient qualifications for entry to
advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements, such as medicine, dentistry, or
architecture. The latter are typically shorter and focus on practical, technical, or occupational skills for direct entry
into the labor market (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2010)).

7

The variation across countries is striking, especially at the secondary level (Table 1). The
share of individuals completing a general secondary education ranges from under five percent in
the Czech Republic to 72 percent in Italy. Most European countries heavily emphasize
vocational programs at the secondary level, with less than one-third completing a general
secondary education, while Chile reports a majority completing a general secondary education.8
At the tertiary level, the variation across countries is smaller. For all but a few countries,
between one third and two thirds of individuals completing a tertiary education received a
university degree, and the U.S. and Chile fall right in the middle. Overall, the U.S. has the
largest share completing tertiary education.
The clear picture from Table 1 is the significant differences in how school systems
around the world are organized. These institutional differences represent distinct policy choices
that presumably affect the labor-market outcomes across countries.
Table 2 describes the educational attainment of different age groups across all sampled
countries. This table highlights the evolution of educational attainment over time. Overall, the
distribution of people completing general or vocational education is quite stable over time. This
description, however, masks differences in the trend across individual countries, where there is
considerable heterogeneity. As shown in Figure 1, although the percentage completing a general
education shows little variation over time for a number of countries, some have moved toward
less general education (e.g., Denmark, Germany, and New Zealand) while others have moved in
the opposite direction (e.g., Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, and Poland).9 (Appendix Table A2

8

Inaccurate reporting of education type at the secondary level is a substantial problem for the U.S.; 60 percent report
“secondary-school equivalency” and do not distinguish general and vocational schooling. The problem is also quite
severe for the Czech Republic and Norway, and, to a lesser extent, for Finland.
9
A caveat here and in the regression analysis is that many of the 16- to 25-year olds are still in school and excluded
from the sample; hence the break from trend by the 16-to-25-year-old cohort may simply reflect this sample

presents a more complete picture of the distribution of educational attainment for each country
and over time).
An important issue, particularly when looking across time within countries, is whether
the relative skills of those in general and vocational programs are changing. The battery of
literacy tests in IALS permits direct observations of cognitive skills by age and schooling type.
The literacy score we use is the average of the three test scores in prose, document, and
quantitative literacy, normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation one within each
country. Table 3 shows that the literacy score is in general higher for younger people and people
with general education.10 The exception is the 16- to 25-year-old cohort, whose literacy score is
lower than the two cohorts immediately ahead of them, but this likely reflects the fact that many
people in this age group are still in school, and those who are not in school are overall of lower
ability. Figure 2 depicts literacy scores by cohort and education type for each country. Except
for a few pairs, in every country the literacy scores for each education type follows a similar
pattern over time, providing some general evidence that the relative selectivity between
vocational and general education programs has not changed substantially over time.
Figure 3 plots the distribution of literacy scores of the two education types for each
country. Again, the figure shows that individuals with general education have on average higher
scores than those with vocational education. More importantly, it shows there is substantial
overlap in literacy scores between the two types, suggesting that individuals completing general
and vocational education share a common support in this important characteristic.

selection. This is most pronounced in the percentage finishing a secondary education and the percentage finishing a
general tertiary education, as shown in Table 1.
10
While literacy scores for each country have been normalized to mean zero and standard deviation one, the average
for both general and vocational schooling is almost always positive, reflecting that both groups are more skilled than
the “other” category that includes individuals not completing secondary school and aiming for neither vocational or
academic programs.

9

The focus of our analysis is employment patterns over the life-cycle. Table 4 shows the
percentage employed of males with different education types across the entire sample for each
cohort, where not being employed includes the unemployed, the retired, and homemaking at the
time of the survey. Individuals with vocational education have a higher employment rate than
individuals with general education for the youngest cohort (16-to-25 years of age). For older
cohorts, however, individuals with general education are more likely to be employed than those
with vocational education, and this is most pronounced for the 56-to-65-year-old cohort.
The employment pattern is not, however, uniform across countries. Figure 4 shows that
the age-employment profile varies significantly, with some countries like the U.S. having almost
identical employment patterns by education type and others like Germany displaying widely
different patterns. Our analysis flows from these differences.

3. Identification of the Impact of Education Type
We are interested in the impact of education types on labor-market outcomes over the
life-cycle. To test our main hypothesis that the relative labor-market advantage of vocational
over general education decreases with age, we compare the age-employment patterns of workers
of the two education types within each country. In the simplest difference-in-differences form,
we permit the age pattern of employment for those with a general education to diverge linearly
from the pattern for the remainder of workers:

empi   0  1agei   2 agei2  1  geni   2  geni  agei  X i     i

In Equation (1), empi = 1 if individual i is currently employed and 0 otherwise; age and age
squared capture the normal age-employment pattern in the economy; geni is an indicator

10

(1)

equaling 1 if individual i has a general education type and 0 otherwise;11 and X is a vector of
control variables for other factors that might affect employment patterns including, importantly,
country fixed effects to eliminate overall country differences and various measures of individual
labor-market skills (other than education type). The coefficient β1 measures the initial
employment probability of those with general education relative to those with vocational
education (normalized to age 16 in the empirical application), while β2 measures the differential
impact of a general education relative to a vocational education on employment with each year
of age.12
The overall difference in employment probabilities between general education and
vocational education reflected in β1 does not adequately identify the impact of general education.
This parameter implicitly includes any elements of selectivity in the completion of different
types of schooling not captured in X, and we doubt that the measured influences on employment
found in our data (and most other surveys) fully capture the systematic differences across
schooling groups. (Note that this is precisely the challenge for attempts to estimate the impact of
vocational education on the school-to-work transition, and highlights the existing uncertainty
about the efficacy of common vocational education policies).
The key parameter for our analysis, however, is β2. In this difference-in-differences
formulation, this reflects the divergence in employment patterns by education type over age
cohorts. The crucial assumption for identifying the causal impact of education type on changes
in employment patterns over the life-cycle is that the selectivity of people into general and

11

The sample for the empirical analysis includes those who reported completing secondary-school equivalency or
other programs. In the estimation, they are treated as a separate category (“other” type), and its interaction with age
is also included.
12
An interaction term between the general-education indicator and age squared is not statistical significant in our
main specification, so we rely on a simple linear-in-age interaction in the basic specification.

11

vocational education (conditional on the X) does not vary over time. In other words, we assume
that today’s old people (in each education category) are a good proxy for today’s young people
in 30 years,13 allowing us to estimate the impact of education type by the divergence in ageemployment patterns across the life-cycle.
If general education becomes less selective relative to vocational education over time in
ways that are not captured by the X, then the changes in the labor market with general education
may reflect simply the varying ability of young and old workers in the different education
categories. Table 3 and Figure 2 show that differences in literacy scores of individuals with
general and vocational education have been generally stable over time, suggesting that the nature
of selection between the two types of education has also been reasonably stable over time. But,
in the estimation we explicitly condition on individual school attainment and literacy scores
along with a series of alternative proxies for selectivity of education within each country. In
addition, we estimate propensity-score matching estimators that match each individual with
vocational education to an observationally comparable individual with general education.
Finally, to allow for nonlinear changes in the impact of education types on employment
with age, we also consider a variant:

empi   0  1agei   2 agei2  1  geni    2 j  geni  cohort ij   X i     i

(2)

j

where the impact of general education on employment is allowed to differ for each age cohort
defined by ten-year age intervals (cohortjj being an indicator equaling 1 if individual i belongs to
cohort j and 0 otherwise).
13

This assumption of comparability of age cohorts is of course identical to the normal assumption in estimating
Mincer earnings functions and other applications that make cohort comparisons with cross-sectional data; see the
specific earnings analysis in Hanushek and Zhang (2009).

12

4. The Impact of Education Type on Employment
Our investigation begins with basic estimates of how employment patterns over the lifecycle are affected by general and vocational education. We then pursue a series of alternative
specifications and robustness checks.
4.1 Basic Results
Table 5 reports OLS regression results of equation (1) for males, in which the impact of
education type on employment status changes linearly with each year of age.14 The sample pools
individuals from all 18 countries in our IALS sample, but all specifications control for country
fixed effects so that the employment impacts are estimated by just the within-country variation.
Column 1 is the most basic specification, where employment status is a function of age, age
squared, years of schooling, as well as whether one’s highest level of education is general
education and its interaction with age. Ceteris paribus, employment rates generally increase
with age, reach the peak at age 36, and then start to decline, consistent with the description in
Table 4. They also increase with years of schooling: one more year of schooling increases the
employment rate by 1.2 percentage points.
Most important to our purpose, while individuals with a general education are initially
(normalized to an age of 16 years) 7 percentage points less likely to be employed than those with
a vocational education, the gap in employment rates narrows by 2 percentage points every ten
years. This implies that by age 50, on average, individuals completing a general education are
more likely to be employed than individuals completing a vocational education. Individuals
completing a secondary-school equivalency or other program (the “other” category) have a
virtually identical employment trajectory as those completing a vocational education.
14

Estimates from a probit model of employment are substantively the same.

13

As noted in the previous section, the coefficient on the general education-age interaction
(β2) can be interpreted as the causal impact of general education on the employment change over
the life-cycle as long as any selectivity into education type has not changed over time. In the
subsequent columns, we add more control variables to account for potential biases from
unmeasured ability or other possible influences on employment (that might vary over time for
people in the different education-type categories).
4.2 Addressing Varying Selectivity into Education Types
A prime concern is that the ability level of individuals completing a general education
may have changed over time with the expansion of education systems around the world,
implying that the coefficient on education type and its interaction with age would also capture
the impact of unmeasured ability on employment at different ages. For example, more able
people may adapt more readily to a changed environment regardless of schooling, making them
more likely to be employed at older age.
We begin by adding the literacy score and its interaction with age (Column 2 of Table 5).
The coefficient on the literacy score is already positive at the age of 16, and the coefficient on its
interaction with age is also significantly positive – implying that more able workers continue
their employment at higher rates with age. The time pattern of literacy skills on employment
underscores exactly the concern with identification of the impact of education types (and shows
the importance of the IALS data). The coefficients on general education type and its interaction
with age become slightly smaller in magnitude – precisely what would be expected with the
expansion of general education and the relatively lower ability of the average young person in
general education. But, importantly, both the general-education indicator and its interaction with

14

age remain statistically significant. In this specification, individuals with general education
overtake those with vocational education in employment probability at age 55.15
In Column 3, in another expansion to allow for time-changing patterns of ability by
school type, we add dummy variables for mother’s education and their interactions with age.
The coefficient estimates on these controls are insignificant in themselves, and they have little
impact on the estimates of other variables relative to Column 2. As a result, we do not control
for mother’s education in later specifications. In Column 4, because parents may directly
influence the educational choices of children, we add a dummy variable for father’s occupation,
taking a value of 1 for professional, and its interaction with age. However, due to missing
information, our sample now only includes seven countries.16 Estimates on these added controls
are insignificant, and again, the estimates on the main variables of interest – general education
type and its interaction with age – are qualitatively the same as in Columns 1-3.
Varying selectivity into the education groups is a general threat to our identification
strategy. In Column 5, we return to the full sample and add three control variables at a more
aggregate level: the percentages completing general and vocational education, respectively, in
each country for each cohort, and the average literacy test score for individuals completing a
particular type of education by country and cohort. These variables reflect variations in labor
skills that change over time and that might distort the selectivity of education choices over time.
A higher average test score indicates higher overall ability of individuals completing a particular

15

The fact that the IALS literacy score is measured at the time of labor-market observation, rather than when the
initial decision between entering a general or vocational program is made, suggests that the measured score may be
affected by the employment history, which includes both occupation-specific skill obsolescence and continuing
adult education. Existing evidence (Ludwig and Pfeiffer (2006)) and our analysis below suggests that both aspects
work against people with vocational education, which introduces bias against our reported findings and suggests that
these may be lower-bound estimates.
16
The seven countries where individuals are surveyed about their father’s occupation are Chile, the Czech Republic,

15

type of education; a larger share of individuals completing a particular type of education
indicates lower selectivity of that education type. The estimates in Column 5 appear to confirm
this speculation: Ceteris paribus, the employment probability is positively related to the average
test score and negatively related to the size of an individual’s education type of each cohort.
Nonetheless, estimates for the key interaction of general education with age (and other variables)
are again almost identical to those in Column 2. In subsequent estimations, we take Column 5 as
our primary specification.
The potential impact of missing students who are still in school is an additional concern.
Column 6 therefore reports results of another robustness check, where we restrict the sample to
individuals aged 20 to 65. The concern is that many of the very young people are still in school.
Hence, when we exclude current students from the analysis, the young people included in the
analysis may not be representative of the youth who eventually finish school and start the schoolto-work transition. With the youngest of all individuals dropped, the young people remaining in
the sample will more closely represent the overall youth population. Indeed, of the males aged
16 to 19, two thirds are still in education, while of those aged 20 to 25, only one quarter are
currently in education.17 These shares of current students in different age groups also suggest
that we do not want to drop all the 16- to 25-year-old group; otherwise, we lose too many young
people who are already potentially in the labor force, and we will not be able to obtain the
estimate of the relative impact of different education types on the school-to-work transition. The
choice of age cutoff in this column is a compromise between these two competing forces related
to the youngest people. Regardless, results from the restricted sample are quite similar to the

16

results in Column 5 for the corresponding specification with a larger age range. The robustness
of the results prompts us to focus on the entire 16-to-65 age group in virtually all later analysis.
While there is a general presumption that the vast majority of male non-employment –
including early retirement – in this age group is involuntary, there is a possibility that generous
early-retirement schemes may be differentially available to workers with vocational and general
education. In this case, the detected age-employment pattern may not necessarily be driven by
differential adaptability to changing economic conditions, but rather by specifics of the existing
retirement policies. As another robustness test to address this possibility, in Column 7 we
restrict the sample to those employed and those unemployed but looking for work, effectively
dropping those from the non-employed category who are retired, homemakers, or non-employed
for other reasons. Results confirm the differential age-employment pattern by education type,
showing that people with vocational education who would like to work are increasingly
becoming more unemployed with age, relative to people with general education. This pattern of
involuntary unemployment indicates that the main finding is not just driven by voluntary early
retirement.18
4.3 Propensity-Score Matching
Figure 3 shows a substantial overlap in literacy test scores between individuals
completing general and vocational education in all countries, even though there are average skill
differences across the groups in most countries. Indeed, this substantial overlap is also found for
age, years of schooling, and family background between individuals completing different types
of education. To further limit possible concerns of selection bias, we can estimate our main
18

In this regard, it might be indicative to look at the age-employment pattern for blue-collar and white-collar
workers separately. Unfortunately, though, in the IALS data occupational information is available only for the
employed and not for those not working at the time of the survey.

model using propensity-score matching to make individuals with a vocational education
comparable to individuals with a general education.
Matching allows us to compare observationally more similar individuals, providing more
confidence in our ability to isolate the impact of the education type itself. The sample is selected
by comparing, for each country, the propensity scores of completing a vocational education
between those individuals who actually completed a vocational education and those individuals
who completed a general education. Individuals in the latter group whose propensity scores are
closest to those in the former group are included in the sample, along with all individuals in the
former group who share a common support in propensity score with the latter group.19
Specifically, in a first stage we estimate a probit model for each country of vocational education
type on age, years of schooling, literacy test scores, and whether mother or father completed a
high-school education. With the predicted propensity score, we use the nearest-neighbor
matching algorithm to match each individual completing a vocational education to one
completing general education. Post-matching tests indicate that in the matched sample, the
disparity between the two groups has been reduced to such an extent that in the majority of
countries, individuals completing the two types of education are statistically identical in each of
the matching variables and the matching variables jointly have no predictive power for the
probability of completing a vocational education, lending credibility to the matching procedure.20
Column 8 of Table 5 reports the results of the matching estimator, which compares
vocational-education individuals only to such general-education individuals who – based on their
ability, family background, age, and years of schooling – would have had the same propensity of
obtaining a vocational education than they themselves had. The matched sample is reduced by

18

about one third. Still, results on the matched sample are very close to the previous results,
indicating that the latter are unlikely to be driven by selection into different education types.
While the reported estimation already imposes a common support by dropping
vocational-education individuals whose propensity score is above the maximum or below the
minimum propensity score of the general-education individuals, our results are confirmed in
additional analyses (not shown) that further improve the common support by trimming 1 (or even
10) percent of the vocational-education observations for whom the propensity-score density of
the general-education observations is the lowest or by imposing a tolerance level (caliper) of 5
(or even 0.5) percent on the maximum propensity score distance between vocational-education
and general-education individuals. Furthermore, results using alternative matching algorithms
such as radius or kernel matching (not shown) also yield qualitatively similar results.
In sum, the estimates in Table 5 show that individuals completing a vocational education
are more likely to be employed when young, but this employment advantage diminishes with
age: as early as age 50, individuals completing a general education start to experience higher
probabilities of employment. This pattern is robust to adding more control variables, dropping
the youngest group in the sample, and using a matched sample. Thus, the raw employment
patterns in Table 4 cannot be attributed simply to varying selectivity into general and vocational
education but instead appear to be caused by the different focus of the schools.

5. Institutional Variations across Countries
The analysis in the previous section pools all countries in the sample even though there is
substantial variation across countries in the relative size of the general and vocational programs
and in the specific organization of the vocational programs. This section takes a closer look at
these differences and how they influence the estimates of the employment trajectory.
19

We first draw on information from the OECD’s Education at a Glance (EAG, see
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2010)). Each year, EAG provides
administrative information on the distribution of upper-secondary-school students between
general and vocational programs. Furthermore, it provides the percentage of students in the
vocational program that are in “combined school and work-based” programs. In these latter
programs, instruction is shared between school and the workplace and may even take place
primarily in the workplace. A good example of the latter is the “dual system” in Germany where
at least 25 percent of the instruction takes place in the work place. Appendix Table A2 presents
the distribution for 2007, the most recent year available, and for 1996, close to the survey time.
The heterogeneity is clear. The U.S. has virtually no vocational program by the official
definitions. In contrast, a number of the European countries such as Belgium, Finland, and the
Netherlands have most of their vocational students in school-based programs. Finally, Germany,
Denmark, and Switzerland stand out by having large combined school and work-based
vocational programs that emphasize apprenticeships.
We classify countries into different categories based on both information from the IALS
sample and the statistics from EAG. Appendix Table A2 also provides the program distribution
of individuals completing an upper secondary education in the IALS sample. We define
“vocational” countries as those countries whose vocational share is at least 40 percent in IALS
data and is at least 50 percent in 1996 EAG or 2007 EAG. Eleven countries belong to this
category: Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Switzerland, and Slovenia. Of these eleven vocational countries, six (Czech
Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Switzerland) have a vocational sector with
at least 25 percent in combined school and work-based programs. We dub these six countries as

20

“non-school based” vocational countries. Note that half the countries in this group are former
centrally-planned economies. Additionally, in a finer look at the mix of school and work
programs, we classify Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland as “apprenticeship” countries,
signifying that the share in combined school and work-based programs exceeded 40 percent in
both 1996 and 2007. Earlier literature suggests that the apprenticeship vocational programs are
the most effective in facilitating youths’ school-to-work transition (see, for example, Lerman
(2009) and the larger review in Wolter and Ryan (2011)). Therefore, the lifetime employment
experience of individuals completing general or vocation education in these countries is
particularly interesting from a policy perspective. Four countries – Chile, Italy, New Zealand,
and the U.S. – are “non-vocational” countries based on these criteria.21
We estimate our preferred specification (Column 5 in Table 5) for each country group
and report the results in Table 6. The first column reproduces the results of Column 5 in Table 5
for comparison. The second column reveals that this pattern does not hold at all for the nonvocational countries: the estimates are insignificant, and there is virtually no difference in
employment patterns between individuals completing different education programs. Moving
from Columns 3 to 5, the samples of countries have gradually larger shares of vocational
education in the form of combined school and work-based programs, which also makes the
definition of the vocational education type clearer and more consistent. Tracing through these
groups, the initial employment gap between individuals finishing vocational and general
education becomes larger, while the rate at which this gap narrows with age also becomes
higher.

21

Although Italy has a significant share in vocational programs from EAG, in the IALS data the share is very small,
at 15.7 percent. Our classification does not apply to Great Britain, Ireland, and Sweden, because information about
education programs for individuals completing secondary school for these countries is missing in the IALS.

21

The pattern is most pronounced in the group of “apprenticeship countries” (Denmark,
Germany, and Switzerland), making the trade-off between early and late employment obvious.
This is depicted for five cohorts in Figure 5, where the employment gains from vocational
education early in the life-cycle are balanced by later employment losses. Given that the
definition of general vs. vocational education types is clearest for apprenticeship countries, part
of our subsequent analysis will focus closely on these countries.
Table 7 reports estimation results separately for each of the vocational countries. While
the results for Denmark are less strong, all three countries belonging to the “apprenticeship”
group display a clear age pattern of employment for individuals finishing different education
programs, confirming the results in the final column of the previous table. Of the five countries
with mostly school-based vocational education programs, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands
display no clear age pattern of employment for individuals finishing different education
programs, while Finland and Slovenia appear to be more similar to the “apprenticeship”
countries. The remaining three countries, all former centrally-planned economies, also display
no clear age pattern of employment for individuals finishing different education programs.
In Table 8, we consider a more flexible, nonlinear model, Equation (2), where we allow
the impact of education type on employment status to vary for different ten-year age cohorts.
The estimation is carried out for each vocational country separately. In Germany and
Switzerland, the age-employment pattern is again striking, with the 56-65 age group completing
a general education having the largest employment advantage over the same age group
completing a vocational education. For Denmark, the estimates have the expected sign but are
mostly of marginal significance. In the pooled sample of the three “apprenticeship” countries,
shown in the final column, the pattern is very clear. In Finland and Slovenia, older people

22

completing general education also are more employed than their counterparts completing a
vocational education. For other countries, we do not observe a clear difference in employment
pattern for people completing different education programs. Appendix Table A3 reports results
from a slightly different non-linear model, in which we restrict the sample to 20-65-year olds and
define the young as 20-30, the middle aged as 31-50, and the old as 51-65. The results are
largely similar.
In another sensitivity test, Table 9 reports results for each country of the linear model
with the sample restricted to individuals completing just secondary education. We lose about
one third of the sample who had tertiary schooling. The results are quite similar to those in
Table 7. Germany, Switzerland, and Finland again display pronounced education programemployment trends; in Denmark, Slovenia, Norway, and Poland, the estimates are insignificant
but of the expected directions.
Overall, the most salient distinction relates to the amount of employer-based
programming. We observe the strongest impact of education programs on employment over age
for Germany, Switzerland, and to a lesser extent, Denmark – all three with large shares of
vocational education in the form of combined school and work-based programs. For other
vocational countries with a much smaller section of the combined programs, only Finland stands
out and shows significantly different age-employment trends for individuals completing general
and vocational education.
In sum, the disaggregation of the IALS sample by intensity of vocational education
shows clear heterogeneity of employment effects. Specifically, countries at the more vocational
end of the spectrum see strong interactions of the age-employment pattern with vocational
training. This lessens to insignificant when we move back to the non-vocational countries.

23

6. The Impact of Education Type on Adult Education and Wages
We consider two additional outcome variables related to education type in this section:
career-related adult education and earnings.
Adult education may help explain the difference in age-employment trends for
individuals finishing different education programs, as people taking more career-related
education are likely more employable given their updated knowledge and skills. We create two
measures of adult education from the IALS: a dummy variable for whether the worker received
any career-related adult education during the past 12 months and the total number of hours of
career-related adult education during the past 12 months. About one third of all males had some
career-related training during the 12 months leading to the survey. At 37 percent, individuals
with a general education are somewhat more likely to have had career-related training compared
to 30 percent for individuals with a vocational education. We again focus on the three
“apprenticeship” countries, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, since these countries show the
strongest age-employment trend for different education types. We estimate a linear ageeducation specification similar to Equation (1). The results for the indicator of receiving training
(in a linear probability model) and hours of training (in a Tobit model) are reported in Table 10.
For all three countries, individuals completing a general education are more likely to receive
career-related education and to receive more hours of it as they become older, but only in
Germany is the estimate statistically significant. Note that for Switzerland, the sample size
becomes much smaller than in the employment analysis.
We also estimate an earnings equation for individuals who work full-time in the 12
months before the survey. This is a straightforward extension of a Mincer earnings function with
the addition of possible age-related differences in earnings patterns for those with general and

24

vocational education. Table 11 reports the estimates on the initial wages of general education
individuals and the interaction with age for each of the vocational countries.22
Finland is the only country where individuals completing a general education earn
significantly less when young but catch up with those with a vocational education over time. In
five of the remaining countries, there is a similar but insignificant pattern. However, we again
encounter a problem of small sample sizes for individual countries. In the pooled sample of all
ten “vocational” countries (with country fixed effects), there is a significant age pattern in
earnings that resembles the age pattern in employment: general-education individuals earn
initially less and later more than vocational-education individuals. Nevertheless, for most
individual countries, the labor-market impact of general versus vocational education comes
mostly through the life-cycle employment effects and not through wage effects.

7. Lifetime Earnings
The previous analysis points to a clear trade-off between early career employment and
employment later in the life-cycle. Thus, we ask the simple question of whether the early
employment gains outweigh the later losses from the viewpoint of individual labor-market
earnings.
Importantly, while we have clear causal estimates of the impact of education type on the
age-employment profile, our estimates of the initial differential in employment are less well
identified. The identification of the initial impact of education type rests on adequately
separating the influence of education type from other market-related factors correlated with these
choices (through the observed skill and background factors). Nonetheless, using the estimate of
the initial employment losses from general education (β1), we calculate the present value of
22

Belgium does not have earnings information in the survey.

25

lifetime employment for workers with different schooling types in the three “apprenticeship”
countries for which we found clearest evidence of the age-employment pattern.23 We weight the
employment at each age by the average earnings for each age cohort by schooling type. 24 Future
earnings are discounted back to age 16 at 3 percent.
These calculations produce very interesting results, suggesting that aspects of the larger
labor market are important for evaluating the efficacy of apprenticeship programs. For Germany
and Denmark, the present value of earnings favors those with a general education. Over the
lifetime, the German worker with a general education will have 24 percent higher earnings than
one with a vocational education, while a Dane with general education will see six percent higher
earnings. For Switzerland, however, the higher present value goes to those with vocational
education; the early earnings gains more than make up for the gains in later earnings that accrue
to workers with general training, and vocational workers have eight percent higher lifetime
earnings.25
An obvious explanation of the country differences follows the motivation for this whole
analysis. In faster growing societies, with commensurately larger technological change, we
expect the greater adaptability of general education coupled with the added adult employment to
yield advantages to the workers. The Swiss annual growth rate in GDP per capita from 19702000 was just 1.1 percent (Heston, Summers, and Aten (2011)). This is less than half the
comparable OECD growth rate (2.4 percent). The Danish growth rate of 2.1 percent and German

23

To the extent that β1 incorporates a combination of the causal impact of general education plus an element of
selection involving other factors, the interpretation would be limited to the economic impact on the typical worker
now in general education as opposed to just the impact of general education.
24
As an alternative, we also use the estimated earnings functions to provide the age-by-schooling information. This
approach acts to smooth out cohort jumpiness in the averages, recognizing that some of the age cohort samples
become fairly small. Nonetheless, the qualitative results with this approach do not differ from using the simple age
cohort earnings averages.
25

26

growth rate of 2.2 percent suggest much more dynamic economies, where the flexibility of
general education has a much greater payoff.26
Interestingly, Wolter and Ryan (2011) indicate that, from the viewpoint of the firm,
Swiss apprenticeships are also beneficial while German apprenticeships are not.27 This raises a
small puzzle, because lower relative wages of trainees partially contribute to the net benefits to
Swiss firms. Thus, at least during the training period, one might expect that the worker would
see lower net benefits in Switzerland. By our data, this training-period disadvantage relative to
Germany is overcome by smaller reductions in subsequent employment and wages of workers
with vocational education relative to Germany.
The overall employment effects of training are undoubtedly related in part to the social
safety net in the specific country being considered. Without early retirement options, it is likely
that a significant fraction of those leaving the labor force in their mid-fifties would actually stay
employed. Thus, for example, in a developing country without a mature system for retirement
income, we might see a very different pattern of employment across the life-cycle along with a
potentially different wage structure.
Moreover, the interaction of the lifetime incomes with government policies and programs
makes it clear that these calculations do not represent a benefit-cost analysis. Both workers and
the government see a different total economic impact, something that goes beyond our analysis
here.

26

This may not, however, be the correct comparison. The Swiss economy did suffer a growth slowdown that is
often attributed to the financial sector. It may be more appropriate to compare the vocational employment results to
the rate of innovation in the economies, something that is intrinsically hard to measure.
27
There is a substantial variation across firms, but Wolter and Ryan (2011) report that “in Switzerland 60% of all
training firms obtain positive net benefits, while in Germany, 93% of training firms incur net costs. A
complementary difference between the countries shows up in labor turnover. In Germany more apprentices remain
with their training company after completion than in Switzerland: 50% and 36% of apprentices stay put for at least a
year afterwards, respectively” (p. 543).

27

8. Conclusions
Our estimates of the impact of vocational education on age-employment profiles indicate
that much of the policy discussion about education programs is too narrow. Vocational
education has been promoted largely as a way of improving the transition from schooling to
work, but it also appears to have an impact on the adaptability of workers to technological and
structural change in the economy. As a result, the advantages of vocational training in
smoothing entry into the labor market have to be set against disadvantages later in life.
We estimate the impact of education type on employment over the life-cycle in a
difference-in-differences approach, comparing the relative performance of individuals with
different education types at different ages. A series of robustness checks validates the
assumption that differential selectivity by age cohort does not bias the estimates.
We also conclude that the impact of vocational education varies considerably with the
specific institutional structure of schooling and work-based training. While the declining ageemployment pattern for those with vocational education relative to those with general education
is found in all vocational education countries, it is most acute in the three apprenticeship
countries in our sample. The balance of early gains against later losses for vocational relative to
general education is not uniform across these countries, though: In line with the relative pace of
economic change in their economies, the balance in lifetime earnings appears to be in favor of
vocational education in Switzerland, but in favor of general education in Denmark and Germany.

Note: Data source: International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). Sample includes all males who finished secondary education or the first stage of tertiary
education and are not currently enrolled in school. Secondary education is classified as one of three types: general for academic or college preparatory programs;
vocational for business, trade, or vocational programs; and other for secondary level equivalency or other programs. First stage of tertiary education is classified
as general or vocational. A general program is one that leads to a university degree (BA/BS); a vocational program is one that does not lead to a university
degree, which is typically shorter and focuses on practical, technical, or occupational skills for direct entry into the labor market. For Great Britain, Ireland, and
Sweden, information on the secondary education types is unavailable.

Note: Linear probability models. Dependent variable: Individual is employed. Sample includes males aged 16 to 65 with secondary or first stage of tertiary
education. All specifications control for country fixed effects. Omitted education type is vocational. Age variable subtracted by 16 throughout. Column 3
controls for indicators for mother’s education and their interaction with age (which turn out insignificant, not shown). Column 7 regards only the unemployed in
the non-employed category. Column 8 is estimated by nearest-neighbor propensity-score matching, with vocational types matched to general types based on age,
years of schooling, literacy scores, and parental education; see text for details. Robust standard errors in parentheses. Significant at *** 1%, ** 5%, * 10%.

Note: Linear probability models. Each column is a separate regression with the same controls as in Column 5 of Table 5. Age variable subtracted by 16.
Countries are grouped based on the shares of upper-secondary-school students in vocational programs, school-based vocational programs, and apprenticeship
reported in the OECD Education at a Glance or calculated from the IALS data (see text for details). Non-vocational countries are Chile, Italy, New Zealand, and
the U.S. Apprenticeship countries are Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. Non-school based vocational countries are the apprenticeship countries plus the
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Vocational countries are the non-school based vocational countries plus Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and
Slovenia. (Great Britain, Ireland, and Sweden are in the full sample of countries but in no sub-sample as the information on secondary school type required for
the classification is missing.) Robust standard errors in parentheses. Significant at *** 1%, ** 5%, * 10%.

Note: Data for OECD 2007 and 1996 are from the 2009 and 1998 versions of the OECD Education at a Glance, Chapter C: Access to Education, Participation,
and Progression. Pre-vocational programs are designed to introduce participants to the world of work and to prepare them for entry into further vocational
programs; successful completion of such programs does not lead to a labor-market relevant vocational qualification. Vocational programs prepare participants
for direct entry into specific occupations without further training. Vocational and pre-vocational programs are further divided into two categories: In schoolbased programs, instruction mainly takes place in a school environment; in combined school- and work-based programs, instruction and training mainly take
place in work-place. The IALS data are calculated from a sample of all individuals who have completed an upper secondary education and are not currently
enrolled in school. “Other” type includes secondary level equivalency and other programs.
