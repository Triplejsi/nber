Theory of International Trade

IBSTPJ\CT

Increasing returns are as fundamental a cause of international trade as
comparative advantage, but their role has until recently been neglected because

of the problem of modelling market structure. Recently substantial theoretical
progress has been made using three different approaches. These are the
Marshalliari approach, where economies of scale are assumed external to firms; the
Chainberlinian approach, where imperfect competition takes the relatively

tractable form of monopolistic competitition; and the Cournot approach of

noncooperative uantity.-setting firms. This paper surveys the basic concepts and
results of each approach. It shows that some basic insights are not too
sensitive to the particular model of market structure. Although much remains to
be done, we have made more progress toward a general analysis of increasing
returns and trade than anyone would have thought possible even a few years ago.

than the world industry as a whole that is subject to increasing
returns. The other good, call it Fish, is produced at constant returns
to scale at the level of both the firm and the industry. We will
assume that both Fish and Chips can be traded costlessly.

Now it is immediately apparent that even though both countries
start with the same

technological

possibilities1 the e>istence of

economies of scale makes it inevitable that there will be
international specialization. To see this, suppose that both countries
were to produce both goods. The fact that both were producing Fish
would imply equal wage rates. But this would mean that whichever

country had the larger Chips industry woLdd have lower cost in that
industry; this would presumably lead that industry's relative size to
increase still further, reinforcing the cost advantage; and we will

have a cumulative process of differentiation between the countries
which continues until at least one of the countries has specialized.

nd as long as one country has specialized, we will have international
trade. So the model tells us

that

increasing returns will, as

expected, lead to specialization and trade.

The problem, of course, is that while the outcome must involve
specialization and trade, this still allows a number

equilibria. A little thought will

suggest that there are three

different kinds of equilibrium which can resL(lt. First, one country

might produce both Chips and Fish while the other produces only Fish.
Second, both countries might

one in Chips and one in Fish.

Third,

one country might specialize in Chips while the other produces

both qoods. Since it is also possible that either country may take on
either role, we seem to have as many as six possible equilibria even
in this simplest model.

To sort out

complexity, it is useful

to

begin by noticing

our first kind of equilibrium, where both countries produce Fish,

quite different from the other two in its implications for factor

prices and welfare. s long as both countries end up producing the

that either country could produce Chips, but these equilibria would

and the world output of Fish would be the same across the two

for each individual, would be the same regardless o-F which country
ends up with the Chips industry. Thus the indeterminacy of the model,

Welfare in this case does not depend on which country produces
Chips; how does it compare with autarky? A further appealing feature
of the equal—wace equilibrium is that it yields a very simple
condition for gains from trade. This is that each country gains -from
trade provided that
is iarqer than the

the scale of th or1d Chips industry after trade
scale of the national industry before trade. The

reason is that this implies a lower unit labor cost and therefore a
lower price in terms of the (common) wage rate. The important points
to notice about this crtierion are, first, that it does not depend on
which country actually produces Chips, and, second, that it is a very
mild condition, likely to be satisfied. Thus we have in a quite simple
way captured the idea that it is to everyone's advantage to be part of
a larger market.
The relative simplicity o-f the analysis when waqe rates are

equalized might lead us

to

ask whether there is some common ground

between this case and the case of factor price equalization in the
Heckscher-—Qhlin model. ifl -fact there is a common aspect, pinpointed in
Helprnan arid Krugrnan (19E). In both the Heckscher—Ohlir, and external

economy models, factor price equalization is a symptom of a deeper
aspect of the trading equilibrium, namely that "trade reproduces the

Once we realize that wage equalization amounts to saying that the
inteqrated economy is reproduced, a technique for analyzing the

prospects for waoe equalization readily follows Firstq construct the

jnterated economy —— i.e.

-factor

endowments calculate what the allocation of labor between the Fish and
Chips industries would have been if labor had been able to move freely

between the two countries. Now in order to reproduce the interated
economy, the trading world must be able to achieve the same scale of

Chips production. Since external economies are assumed to be country—
specific, this means that the world Chips industry of the integrated
economy must now fit into one of the national economies with some room
to spare.

The implications of this condition are illustrated in Figures 1
and 2. In each diagram the line 00* represents the world endowment of
labor. The division of that endowment between the two countries can be
represented by a point on that line. Also, in each figure the distance
O0=Q'O* represents the labor -force devoted to Chips production in the
integrated economy. The di-f-ference between the figures is

It is now straightforward to see what is

reproduction of the integrated economy. In Fiqure 1, splitting the

it can.

What this analysis shows is that an equal—wage equilibrium in

which both countries produce Fish is not something which is unlikely
to exist. Indeed, unless the share of the world labor force devoted to

concentrating on the equal—wage case

the fact that an equal wage equilibrium exists

need not mean that it is the only equilibrium. Suppose. -for example,

that Foreign is substantially smaller than Home, so that the endowment
point in Figure 1 lies to the right of 0'.

Then there is an equal—wage

equilibrium with the Chips industry concentrated in Home. but there
might also be an equilibrium in which Foreign specializes in Chips and
has higher wages. We can only rule this out if Figure 1 is the
relevant figure and the endowment division lies between C! and 0' —— in

effect, if the increasing returns sector is riot too large and the
countries are not too unequal in size.

12
An equal—wage equilibrium in which trade reproduces the

integrated economy, then, is not the only possible outcome even in
this simplest model. It is however a plausible outcome and one which
yields appealingly simple results. Ihus there is some iustification
for stressing this sort of outcome. Further, the idea of reproducing

B. Increasing Returns and Comparative dvantage

The model presented above is one in which increasing returs is
the only source of trade and gains from trade. This is of course an

extreme and unrealistic case Just as is the Heckscher—Oh]in model in
Thic:h differences in relative factor endowments are the

only

source.

What we would like is a model in which both types of motive are ab].e
to operate.

There is a considerable literature on what happens in the 2x2
model when one sector is subject to increasing returns. Contributions

to that literature include in particular Kemp and Negishi (1970),

Melvin(1969) and Fanaqariya(198).

Suppose that there are some

goods which

are produced with

country—specific external economies, and that there are others which
are produced with constant returns. Suppose also that there are two or

14

more factors of

production.

Then a little thought will show that in

order to reproduct the integrated economy we must be able to do the

following: we must be able to distribute the integrated economys

then, that we have a world in which there are at least

What else can we say about trade?

15

The first thing we can say is that there

will

be specialization

due to economies of scale: every increasing returns sector will be
concentrated in a single country. Thus even if every country had the

same factor endawment, there would still be specialization and trade

to scale economies. As in the case of the one—factor model this
specialization will in general have an arhitrr-y component: each

but hich country it is concentrated in may be indeterminate.
Despite this indeterminacy, in an average sense there will be a
relationship between factor endowments and the pattern of production
and trade. A country with a high relative endowment of capital must on

average produce a capital—intensive mix of goads, although it may
produce some relatively labor—intensive ones. I.e., the factor content
of a country 's production must match its factor endowment. On the

other hand, if countries spend their income in the same way, all
countries will consume the same mix of goods, and thus the same mix of

factor services embodies in those goods. It follows that countries
will be net e>porters of the services of factors in which they are
abundantly endowed, and thus that in an average sense the factor
proportions theory of trade will hold.
The
now

of gains from trade. Clearly there are

two sources o-f potential gains from

trade: specialization to take

advantage of differences in relative factor endowments and

specialization to achieve larger scale a-f production. The usual

analysis o-f gains from trade, with its discussion of the enlargement

of each nation's consumption possibilities, does not carry over easily
into an increasing returns world where the pattern of production and

we focus on factors rather than goods. And this is in fact the case.

What we can establish is the following: After trade a country

Kruqman(198)). Thus our criterion for gains from trade in the
simplest model has now become a sufficient —— not necessary ——

condition for gains in a more elaborate model. The reason it is only a
sufficient condition is, of course, that there are now additional

To understand this condition, consider a country which uses two

different from be-Fore, say TT. This change in factor prices is

The essential requirements to get this story are the willingness to
assume that a trading world reproduces the aggregate outcomes o-F a

hypothetical perfectly integrated economy —— with factor price
equalization as one of the consequences; and a willingness to focus on
net

trade in factor services rather than

on

trade in goods, which is

typically indeterminate. Given these concessions, we are able to
describe a world economy in which both factor proportions and scale

contribute to international trade, and in which both are
sources of gains from trade. In particular:

gains from trade for all countries.

(iv) These gains will be supplemented by additional qains if the
world scale 0-f production in increasing returns industries, wherever

they may be located, exceeds the national scale which would prevail in
the absence of trade.

11. The Chamberljnjan Approach

20
The 1970s were marked by substantial progress in the theoretical
modelling of imperfect competition. Among the approaches developed by
industrial organization theorists was a revival of Chamberlin's "large
ciroup" analysis of competition between similar firms producing

differentiated products. This analysis, once put in the form of fully
specified cieneral equilibrium

models,

could be applied in a

straightforward way to international trade, where it has proved a
flexible tool of analysis.

The basic Chamberlinian idea is that one can think of at least

some industries as being characterized by a process of entry in which
new firms are able to differentiate their products from existing

firms. Each firm will then retain some monopoly power, i.e., will face
a downward sloping demand curve. Given economies of scale, however,

this is not inconsistent with a situation in which entry drives

economic profits t zero. ThUS Chamberlin's vision was of an industry
consisting of many little monopolists who have crowded the field
sufficiently to eliminate any monopoly profits.

The limitation which prevented much use of this approach in

international trade theory before the 1970s was the absence of any
rigorous treatment of the process of product differentiation. In the

70s. however two approaches to this problem were developed. The
first, identified with the work o-f Dixit and Stiglitz(1977) and

Spence(1976) imposed the assumption that each consumer has a taste
for many different varieties o-f a product. Product differentiation

21

then simply takes the form of producinq a variety not yet being
produced. The alternative approach, developed by Lancaster(1979) and

by Salop(198?), posited a primary demand not for varieties per se

but

for attributes of

varieties, with

consLtmers dif+erinQ in their

preferred mix of attributes. Froduct differentiation in this case
takes

For some purposes the differences between these approaches are
important. For international trade theory, however, it does not matter
much

which approach

is used. The important point is that both

approaches end with an equilibrium in which a number of differentiated
products are produced by firms which possess monopoly power but earn
no monopoly profits. This

Consider a world cortsistinq of two countries, Home and Foreiqn

the same technology to produce two goods, Food and Manufactures. Food
is simply a homogeneous

product produced under constant returns to

of many potential varieties, each produced under conditions of
increasinq returns. We assume that the specification of tastes and

this is

important.

The next step is to ask whether a trading economy will reproduce
this integrated economy. Let us measure Home's endowment starting from

world into countries can be represented by a point in the box, such as

E. If we assume that the varieties of Manufactures are numerous enough
that we can ignore integer constraints, then it is immediately
apparent that trade reproduces the integrated economy as long as the

endowment point lies inside the parallelogram OO*Q'.

has a slope equal to relative

line along which the shares of Home and Foreign in world income are

constant. This means in particular that resources DC receive the same
share of world income as OE, and thus that OC/OO* is the Home
country's share of world income. Let us now add the assumption of
identical spending patterns, and we know that each country wi 11

consume embodied factor services in the same proportion as the world
supplies. It follows that DC is also Home consumption of factor

services, and thus that EC is net trade in factor services As in the

varieties.

Since each country is

assumed to demand all varieties, this

means that Home will still demand some varieties produced in Foreign.

More important, in a broad sense the analysis is essentially the same
as that

which we have seen emerqes from the assumption that economies

of scale are external to firms. The precise pattern a-f trade is

indeterminate, but factor proportions continue to determine trade in
an average sense; scale economies lead to concentration of production
and to a persistence of trade even when countries have identical

factor endowments. As we will arQue in a moment, the analysis of qains

B. Applications and Extensions

Once we move away from the central issue a-f

pattern, the

conclusions a-f the Chamberlinian approach begin to become a bit more
dependent on particular assumptions. Several areas have, however,
yielded results which either look fairly general or are

a-f particular

interest. We consider -Four such areas: the gains from trade, trade and

income distribution, intermediate qoods, and transport costs.

1. Gains from trade

At first sight it might seem that the analysis of gains from
trade in the external economies approach would carry over directly to
the Chamberlinian approach as well. In fact, however, the translation
is not direct, -for two related reasons. First, the relevant scale

variable is not the scale of the industry but the scale a-f production
of individual firrns, and with entry the effects of trade on this scale

are not immediately obvious. Second, trade may lead to extra gains due
to an increase in the variety of products available.

What we can certainly say is that a country will gain from trade
if after trade both the number a-f available varieties and the scale of
production a-f each

variety

are at least as large as

trade.

is one of

Here the nature of

product differentiation does make a

difference. What happens to the scale of production depends (for
homathetic production functions ——

otherwise still mare complications

arise) on what happens to the elasticity of demand for individual
varieties.. With Dixit—Stiqlitz preferences, this

elasticity

is

constant; trade offers cireater van ety but not cireter scale (Dix it
and Norman 1980; Krugman 1980,1981).. With Lancaster preferences, trade

is likely, thouqh not certain, to lead to more elastic demand, forcinq

firms to move further down their averaQe cost curves, so that the
advantacies of a larqer market are reflected both in qreater diversity

and lower averae cost (Helpman 1981).
qain, however, we should not make too much of the details. Eoth
increased scale of production and increased diversity of available

products can be seen as aains from scale, broadly defined. This

insiqht is qiven dmore concrete form by Helpman and Kruqman(1985).
where it is shown that under some assumptions both scale and diversity
will move monotonically with qross industry output. This leads to the
followinq criterion for gains from trade: trade is beneficial if the
world output a-f tianuf actures is 1 arqer than our national output would
have been in the absence of trade.. The similarity to the criterion -For
the external economy case should be obvious.

In several papers Ethier(1979;1982b) has suggested that scale

tJhat difference does this make? The answer is that as long as

trade reproduces the integrated economy, as it does in the models of
Ethier and Helprnan(1785, having trade in intermediate goods rather
than final goods does not make much di -fference at all. The main
difference is one of emphasis: it now becomes very clear that the

We may also note a point raised by Helpman and Krugrnan(1985): if
intermediate goods produced with economies of scale are not tradeable,

the result will be to induce the -formati on of industrial complex es,
groups o-f industries tied together by the need to concentrate all

There is no general analysis of oligopoly; but even a special
analysis is better than none. Some important insights into
international trade have been gained by adopting the admittedly

unsatisfactory Cournot assumption that imperfectly competitive firms

take each others outputs as given. Much of the usefulness of this
approach has come in the analysis of trade policy, discussed in the
paper by Dixit; but two themes deserve discussion in this paper. The

The possibility o-f gains from trade due to increased cometitio,-,

becomes an obvious possibility that the increase in competition due

trade may leave firms unable to charqe a markup on rnarqinal cost

The pro—competitive effect of trade is not exactly a scale

because decreasinq costs are the most natural explanation o-f

B. Market SmentaUon and Price Discrimination

At the be1nn1nQ of this paper we suqQested that trade can always
be explained as beinq due to the combined effects o-f

two motives for

specialization, differences between countries and economies o+ scale.

Remarkably, the Cournot approach has actually led to the discovery of
a third possible e>planatior for trade —— although arguably not of

39

equal importance in practice. This is the possibility that trade may
arise purely because imperfectly competitive firms have an incentive
to try to gain incremental sales by "dumping" in each others' home
markets.
The

seminal paper is by 13r ander (1980). The model envi saqes an

however be an incentive for each firm to sell a little bit in the

firm has a fifty percent share of each market.
If the markets are separated by transport costs, the outcome will

C. Summary

aplicatiori o-f Cournot—type models to trade theory leads to
new and important insights about international trade. Papers using the
Cournot approach have had a fundamentally di-f-ferent orientation from
those using the Marshallian or Chamberlinian approaches. Instead of
focussing on economies of scale arid treating market structure as a

source a-f potential qains from trade is identified —— namely, the

e-ffect

of trade in increasirq competition (andq if it induces exit, in

"rationaiizirtq production). MorE' surprisinqly, a new cue of trade
is also identified: interpenetration of markets because oliqapalists
perceive a hiciher elasticity of demand on exports than on domestic
sales.

The major importance of

the Cournot approach however, lies

outside the scope of this paper. This is its versatility and
flexibility for the discussion o-f trade policy. The models we have

described under the headinqs of Marshallian and Chamberlinian
approaches mostly depend on the assumption that trade reproduces an
inteqrated economy as a way to make the analysis tractable. Tariffs,

quotas, subsidies inevitably break this perfect inteqration, renderin
these models unsuitable. The Cournot approach, however, does not have

this problem, and has id to a rapidly qrowinq literature on trade and
industrial policy under imperfect competition.

few years ago it is probably fair to say that when
international economists thought about the role of increasing returns
in trade at all, they implicitly thought in terms of a 2x2 model in
which one sector is subject to external economies. In this approach

scale economies appear as a modification or distortion of comparative
advantage, rather than an independent source of trade. The effect of

returns is to make it ii kel y, other things equal that
large countries will export goods subject to scale economies. One can
find many writings in which the view is taken that this effect is the

What we have now moved to is a -far more satisfactory view in
which increasing returns are -fully i ritegrated into th trade model
rather than grafted on to the Heckscher—Ohlin model as ar

a-fterthought. The new approaches allow us to understand clearly that
decreasing costs are ar i ndeendent source c-f both trade and gal ns
-from trade,

ar:d to have a clear vision

o-f a trading world in which

43

both increasing returns and differences in factor endowments drive the
pattern of specialization and trade.
This shift in view was initially larqely brouciht about by the

introduction of new models of imperfect competition into trade theory.
With some perspective, however, we can now see that the details o-F

these models are less important than miht have appeared at first.
What is really crucial for the new view of trade is not so much the
particular model of market structure but a chanqe in modelling
strateqy. The key breakthrough has been a willinqness to ask different

questions, and be satisfied with a somewhat different answer than we
were used to.

Traditionally, trade models have qiven us a precise description

of the pattern of trade in goods. In models where there are important
increasing returns, however, a characteristic feature is the existence

of multiple equilibria. What we have learned to do is essentially to
learn to live with multiple equilibria, by focussing on models where a
good deal can be said without requiring that we know the precise
pattern o-F specialization and trade. By concentrating on resource

allocation rather than goods production; by looking at trade in
embodied factor services rather than in the precise goods in which

these factor services are embodied; by noting that it may be more
important to be able to show that production will be concentrated

somewhere than to say where it will be concentrated, we are able to
bypass the complexities that led trade theory to avoid discussion of
increasing

returns for many years.

everyone 's taste. The payoff here has, however, been remarkable: by

B. What needs to be

done

The theory of trade under increasing returns is not a finished
product. Much work still needs to be done especially in three areas.
These are the following:
(1) Dynamic models: In the real worlds many of

the advantages of

probably take the form of dynamic economies, whether in

the

learning effects or fixed—cost--like R&D. The

dynamic competition in oligapolistic markets may be quite
different in character from what static models would suggest, and
needs to be studied.
(ii) More realistic models o-f competition: Not much need be said
here. The external economy approach is clearly unrealistic in assuming
that

perfect competition; the

Chamberlinian approach relies on

funcamental 1 y peculiar cross—restrictions an technology and

the Cournot approach is surely far too crude.
(iii) The unreproduced integrated economy:
