The Return to Tax Sirrplification: An Econantric Analysis

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of the probable
saving in the resource cost of complying with the tax law that would

result from simplifying the individual income tax law. These estimates
are based on an econometric analysis of the tax filing behavior in
1982 of a sample of Minnesota taxpayers.

A simple model of tax compliance behavior based on utility
maximization is first presented in order to suggest the important

determinants of compliance behavior. The empirical model treats
the discrete choices of whether to itemize deductions and whether to
hire professional tax advice, and the choice of how much time and
money to spend, conditional on the discrete choices made.
Simulations based on the econometric results suggest that
significant resource saving could be expected from eliminating the
system of itemized deductions, although no significant saving from
changing to a single-rate tax structure can be confidently predicted.

Introduction
..-S-tudents of tax complexity and simplification have, in their writings,

highlighted the many dimensions of this subject. An important issue to the tax
lawyer is the certainty, or predictability, of the tax law. To the tax collection agency, complexity in large part relates to the administrative cost of
raising revenue, and in particular to the encouragement that some tax provisions
provide for the use of complicated tax devices designed to avoid tax payments.
For the taxpayer himself, a critical aspect of complexity is the time and
expense involved in completing the tax return, including not only complying with
the filing requirement, but also identifying and documenting the deductions,
credits, and reductions in taxable income to which he is entitled.

The disadvantages of complexity in the tax system are suggested by these

various aspects of the concept. Unpredictability and the existence of copli—
cated ways to avoid taxes may erode confidence in the fairness of the tax system

and thereby affect voluntary compliance.1 It may also subsidize those taxpayers
who are not averse to interpreting the tax law to their advantage (legally or
illegally), an aspect which to many has an unacceptable distributional implica-

tion. The process of income tax collection under the current system also
involves substantial resource costs. A recent study (Slemrod and Sorurn (1984))
estimated the resäurce cost of income tax filing borne directly by taxpayers in
the United States to be on the order of five to seven percent of revenue

collected. A conservative estimate of total collection costs, which includes
the resources used by the collection agencies and third parties (primarily
employers which participate in the withholding system), is seven to eight percent of total revenue, or about $30 billion annually.

Clearly, complexity in a tax system has substantial resource costs and

-2-

arguably adverse distributional consequences. This does not, though, imply that
the best tax system is necessarily the simplest one. As Surrey (1969) and
others have argued, a certain amount of complexity is the inevitable result of
the intent to maintain standards of horizontal and vertical equity in an

exceedingly complex economic environment. In addition, the present income tax
system is the vehicle for the subsidization of a vast array of behavior such as

charitable giving, installing energy saving equipment, and homeownership.2 Any
argument to eliminate these tax expenditure aspects on the grounds of simplifi-

cation must come to terms with the reasons, if any, for the subsidization. If
subsidization through the tax system is replaced by a more direct subsidy
program, then the operation of the government as a whole has been simplified
only if the direct method is more cost—efficient than the tax expenditure
method.

-

An analysis of any tax simplification proposal ought to consider its advan-

tages, including the savings in the resource cost of compliance, along with the
distributional and efficiency implications of the proposal. Brannori (1979) and
Slemrod (1983) have argued that, in principle at least, the resource costs
(called "complication costs" by Brannon) can be quantified and considered with

the more standardequity and efficiency effects. The principle obstacle to
implementing this framework for analysis has been the dearth of quantitative
information about the resource cost implications of simplification plans.
Although recent work has provided useful estimates of the total resource cost of
the current income tax system, what is more important for policy purposes is the

expected change in the resource cost due to a proposed tax reform. This is the
valuable input for the purpose of analysis, not the current level of resource

-3-

costs.

The purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of the probable resource

cost savings from some currently popular tax law simplification plans. These
estimates are based on an econometric analysis of the tax filing behavior in

1982 of a sample of Minnesota taxpayers. The study does not consider the likely
impact on the administrative or third—party costs of the simplification plans,
nor its distributional or standard efficiency effects, so it comprises only one
part of a complete analysis of any of the proposed reforms.

The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, a simple
theoretical model of tax compliance behavior based on utility maximization is

presented. The model is used to suggest the important determinants of
compliance behavior to be considered in an empirical study,, and what the likely

direction of influence is. Section 3 develops an empirical model that treats
the discrete choices of whether to itemize deductions arid whether to hire pro-

fessional tax advice, and the choice of how much time and money to spend, con-

ditional on the discrete choices made. Section 4 describes the data for the
analysis. In Section 5, the results of the econometric analyses are presented
and discussed. Section 6 utilizes these estimates to simulate the likely impact
of two proposed tax simplification plans, and Section 7 offers some concluding
colTinents.

2. A Simple Theoretical Model of Compliance Behavior
The goal of this section is to construct a simple model of the taxpaying

household's choices concerning its tax filing behavior. The household must
choose how much of its own time to spend on tax matters and how much, if any,

professional tax advice to purchase.3 It is assumed that both of these activities uncover legitimate ways to reduce taxable income, and thereby reduce tax

liability. The model thus abstracts from the use of illegal reductions in or
deductions from taxable income. This assumption allows the consumer problem to
be posed as one of complete certainty.4 The decision problem for a representative household can be stated as

equal to zero otherwise
price per hour of professional tax assistance
reductions in taxable income
standard deduction
tax function

labor—equivalent of one hour spent on tax compliance

According to (la), utility is a function of consumption of a composite

-5-

good, labor supply, and hours spent on tax matters. Equation (ib) states that
consumption equals gross income, which consists of exogenously given non-labor
income and labor income, minus taxes paid and payments for professional tax

assistance. Taxable income is gross income minus exemptions, which require no
effort to uncover, reductions intaxable income, and deductions from taxable
income, which equal (1—I)S + I(D+PBB).

Note that if the household chooses not

to itemize deductions (1=0), allowable deductions are simply the standard

deduction amount. When the household itemizes deductions (1=1), it can deduct
D+PBB from taxable income.

Consider a compliance technology which embodies the relationship between
the tax liability claimed and the, inputs to the processes. We represent this
technology by the R and D functions as follo&s

(2a) R =

(H,B,G,N,c2)

(2b) 0 =

(H,B,G,N,).

They state that both the amount of reductions in taxable income and the amount
of deductions from taxable income depend on the amount of own time spent on
uncovering either, the amount of professional assistance purchased, the type of

tax return the household files (indexed by C) some personal characteristics
(indexed by ) such as age, level of education completed, and attitude toward
tax matters, and the tax law itself (c2).

Time and money spent on uncovering and

documenting deductions are treated distinctly from resources spent on finding
reductions in taxable income because the former activities are worthwhile only
if the household chooses to itemize deductions, while the latter may be

worthwhile to any household whch has a nonzero marignal tax rate. This

-6-

distinction will be Important later when we consider the impact of eliminating

the itemization option. Note that the deductions and reductions functions are
general enough to allow for the possibility that time and money devoted to one
pursuit may have an indirect effect on the other.

One crucial assumption implicit in this formulation is that the elements of

the G vector are not subject to household choice. The impact of this assumption
is that the compliance technology and tax code do not affect the type of income
earned (employed versus self—employed, income from real estate, partnerships,
for example) nor do they affect the activities that cause potential deductions,
such as purchasing medical services, making charitable contributions, borrowing
money, and so on.

The household is faced with a jotnt decision problem. It must make a
discrete choice between itemizing deductions or not. —

Conditional

on that

choice, it must decide how much labor to supply and how much to expend on
compliance, including its own time and payments for professional tax preparers.
The household will choose whichever itemization status yields the higher

level of utility. Without considering compliance costs this decision involves a
comparison of S and D+P88, where D+PBB is to be interpreted as the amount of

available deducti6ns. If D+PBB exceeds the standard deduction, S, then the
household would itemize deductions. However, in the presence of compliance
costs the choice is more complicated because it is no longer costless to uncover

and document the deductions. The preferred choice will depend on the household's utility function, its endowment (including the level of tax exemptions),
and its individual and tax return characteristics which affect the compliance
technologies.

—7-

The first—order conditions of the Kuhn-Tucker optimization problem for the

conditional choice of H, B, assuming that the choice of L is interior, are

(3a) t(RH+IDH) - Yw(1-t) < 0

(3b) t(RB+IDB) — (1—It)P5 < 0

0 if H > 0
= 0 if B > 0

where t stands for the marginal tax rate and first partial derivatives are
denoted in the usual way. Note that the value of

I enters the first—order

conditions in two separate ways. First, the marginal benefit of uncovering
deductions can be positive only if

I

is one. In addition, the after—tax cost

of professional tax'advice depends on the itemization decision because these
expenses are deductible from taxable income.

Differentiation of (3a)—(3b) allows us to investigate the effect on
compliance bePtavior of changes in the marginal tax rate, the net wage rate, and

the itemization status when both H and B are positive. Unfortunately, even in
this simple model, few unambiguous statements can be made about the sign of

these relationships. It is, though, worthwhile to briefly look at the implications of the theoretical model. The detailed calculations are presented in an
appendix to this paper.

An increase in the marginal tax rate directly increases the payoff from

reducing taxable income by a dollar. For itemizers, it also decreases the cost

of professional tax assistance. The theory implies that both H and B will
necessarily increase only if H and B are complementary inputs in both
compliance technologies. Otherwise it is conceivable that an increase in

will induce a change in technique so that either H or B

,

but

t

not both, will

-8-

increase.

An increase in the after—tax wage rate, holding t constant, increases the
opportunity cost of own time spent on tax matters. This leads to an unnbiguous

decline in H , but the effect on B is not determinate. For non-itemizers, B
will decline if it is complementary with H in the taxable income reduction

technology, and increase otherwise. For itemizers, the response of B depends
or' its complementarity with H in both the TMdeduction" and 0reduction" technologies.

Itemization status is not a continuous variable and thus its impact is not

as accessible using the calculus. However, inspection of the partial effect of
a small increase in

I

is revealing. The effect is similar to that of an

increase in the marginal tax rate. First of all, the payoff to uncovering
deductions (but not_reductions) from taxable income increases in proportion to

the marignal tax rate. Second, the cost of professional tax assistance
declines, again in proportion to the marginal tax rate. The impact of a change
in

I on H and B depends, as in the case of the marginal tax rate, on

whether H and B are complementary inputs. If they are, then an increase in
I

will increase both H and B .

either H or B

If

they are not, it is conceivable that

but not both, could decline.

As we will see later, for many observations, B equals zero and (3b) does not

hold as an equality. In this case differentiation of (3a) alone reveals that,
as long as own

time

spent is subject to locally diminishing returns, an increase

in the marginal tax rate will increase I-I, an increase in wO.t will decrease H,

and a small increase in I will cause H t increase,

3. Estimation Strategy
For each household in the sample, we observe whether deductions were itemized (I), H, B,

and the values of several exogenous variables which, we

hypothesize, affect tax compliance behavior either by entering the tax

compliance technology or affecting tastes for tax related work. We observe
that, although virtually no households report that zero time was spent filing
tax returns, a significant fraction report no expenditures on tax assistance.
Our goal is to use these data to estimate the determinants of tax filing
behavior, including the discrete choices of whether to itemize deductions and

whether to purchase tax advice, and the determinants of the expenditure of time
and money, conditional on the outcome of the two discrete choices.
We consider .two distinct estimation approaches. The first approach is to

estimate reduced form equations for H and B using ordinary least—squares.
We include all exogenous variables as regressors plus a dumy variable for
itemization status, and, in a alternative version, also an interactive dumy
variable. This model has the advantage of transparency and direct interpretability. At the same time, it ignores the statistical problems that arise
because of the endogeneity of the itemization decision and the existence of a

significant fractfn of households that do not hire any professional tax assist-

ance. This first problem is especially significant because one of the goals of
this research is to investigate the effect of eliminating the option of
itemizing deductions.

The second estimation approach is decidedly more ambitious. We proceed by
constructing a general linear model that can accomodate all of the important

aspects of the theoretical model and data structure. The model has three parts.

-10-

In the first part, we introduce an unobservable variable 1* , which is a
measure (of arbitrary scale) of the difference between the maximum utility
attainable in the event the taxpayer itemizes deductions and the maximum utility
attainable if deductions are not itemized; that is,

k[V1(11z1) — V1(11z0)J

(4)

where k

is an arbitrary constant. We posit that 11* is a linear function of

the exogenous variables of the system,

Zj ,

and append an additive error term,

which encompasses both optimization error and unobservable variables which

affect

'

such as intelligence and unknown characteristics of the taxpayer's

tax situation, so that

(5) I= "Zi +

Ij

= 1

iff I >0

= 0 1ff

< 0.

We make the standard assumption that Cj

is

distributed as a standard normal

variable. Equation (5) indicates that, although 11* is unobserved, the
itemization decision is observed, so that we know whether 11* is positive or
no t.

The second part of the system models the decision of whether to purchase

professional tax advice, conditional on the itemization status chosen. As with
the itemization decision, it is posited that there is a latent variable (called

either J*1j or J*Ni for itemizers and non—itemizers, respectively) which
represents the propensity to pay for professional advice (or, more formally, the
difference between attainable utility if advice is contracted for and attainable

—11—

utility if it is not hired). The unobserved variable is presumed to be a linear
function of the exogenous variables of the system, and also contains an error
term which encompasses both optimization error and the influence of unobservable.

The third part of the system models the choice of H and B

on the outcome of the two discrete choices. A linear representation of the

Here XH and XB refer to the vectors of exogenous variables in the H and B
equations, respectively. The error terms in equations (7a)—(7d) may be corre-

lated with the error terms in (5), (6a), and (6b). Note that when J1j is zero
(no professional assistance hired), (7b) is irrelevant and (7a) collapses to

(7a') H 'I1XHi + UHIj

Similarly,

when J is zero, (7d) is irrelevant and (7c) reduces to

(7c') H = 'N1XHi +

UHNI

It is worth noting that the system outlined here is more general than a
"Tobit" type system in which one structural equation determines both the probability that a household pays for professional assistance and the amount spent,

conditional on spending any positive amount. In this more general structure,
the two decisions are allowed to respond differently to exogenous variables.
This differentiation is appropriate if, for exam7le, there are fixed costs

involved in purchasing professional tax advice. The existence of fixed costs is
in fact reasonable, as the preparer must become familiar with the return before
the return can be completed. 'For complicated and idiosyncratic returns with
large fixed costs associated with preparation, it is plausible that a taxpayer
may be unlikely to hire professional advice but, if any assistance is purchased,
a substantial amount will be required.
It is well known that direct estimation of (7a)—(7d) by ordinary least
squares will yield biased coefficient estimates because the expected value of
the error term, conditional on the household being observed in a particular
itemization and professional assistance regime, is generally nonzero and corre-

—13—

lated with the explanatory variables. Our strategy in this event is to utilize
a two—stage estimation procedure. The first stage is to estimate the bivariate
discrete choice model outlined above of whether to itemize deductions and
whether to hire professional tax assistance, conditional on the itemization

decision. In the second stage, the estimates of the discrete choice model are
utilized to control for the self—selection biases in the estimation of the
simultaneous system of (7a)-(7d).
The first stage of the estimation begins with our stated assumptions that

both cj and "Ii and also c and "Ni have a joint normal distribution, and that
each term has unit variance. Next we divide the observations into four regimes
as follows:

*

(8)

:

I > 0 ,

J*

> 0

(itemize, hire assistance)

*

R2

:

J11 < 0

(itemize, don't hire assistance)

I < 0 , N1 > 0

(don't itemize, hire assistance)

I.j > 0 ,

(don't itemize, don't hire assistance)

As mentioned above, the results of the first—stage estimation are to be

used in the estimation of the parameters of (7a)-(7d). To see how this works,
we first write the reduced forms of these equations as

The problem with estimating (lOa)—(lOf) by ordinary least squares is that

the error terms are not necessarily uncorrelated with the explanatory variables,

given the self—selection rules. For example,

(11)

Jij = 1)

form

a consistent

estimator of E(uj1 J

terms in (lOb)—(lOf), conditional on regime. For example, it can be shown that

one argument in the cumulative density function, it refers to a univari ate

distribution, and when there are three arguments, it refers to a bivariate

distribution. Similar expressions analogous to (13) that correspond to the
expected value of the error terms in equations (lOb)-(lOf) can be derived. Note
that the terms in the square brackets are E(c1

example, an ordinary least-squares procedure for the observations in regime 1
would include as explanatory variables not only the union of XH and X8, but in

addition would include the two terms in square brackets. Lee, Maddala, and
Trost (1980) have shown, in a similar model, that the estimates of the parame-

ters of (lOa) so obtained areconsistent, though the estimated standard errors
from the ordinary least-squares equations will underestimate the true standard

4. Data
The data for this study are drawn from a mail survey of Minnesota house-

holds' tax filing behavior. Inmediately after the deadline for filing 1982 tax
returns (April 15, 1983), a four-page questionnaire was mailed to a random

sample of 2,000 Minnesota residents. The response rate of the survey was 32.65

percent. Of the 653 questionnaires returned, 41 were from people not required
to file 1982 state or federal tax returns. Thirty—eight questionniares were
eliminated from the sample because of incompleteness, leaving a total of 574

usable responses. A detailed description of the data and survey procedures is
presented in Slemrod and Sorum (1984).
The questionnaire's first section asks for some demographic information, in
particular the respondent's sex, age, level of education completed, income,

employment status, occupation, and wage rate or reservation wage. In assessing
this information, it is important to realize that the cover letter pointedly
asks that the addressee refer the questionnaire to the TMperson in [the] house-

hold most familiar with filing [theJ income tax returns." Thus the distribution
of demographic characteristics should not be expected to precisely replicate the
population distribution of cfraracteristics. In particular, answers to questions
about sex and educ-ation would be expected to be biased if, as the data indicate,

males tend to be more familiar with the returns or, as is likely, the more educated household member is more familiar with the filing process.
The next section of the questionnaire solicits information about the house—

hold's income tax return itself. The taxpayer is asked which, if any, of the
three federal tax returns and which, if either, of the two Minnesota state tax

forms was filed. In addition, responses are sought concerning whether the

-18-

return featured itemized deductions, whether it was a joint return, and which of
several sources of income were received.

The remainder of the questionnaire is devoted to collecting information

about the household's cost of filing tax returns. This section asks how many
hours were spent during the year, and a breakdown of the hours into various

categories. In addition, any money spent on tax assistance or otherwise spent
in filing returns is solicited. A question on the individual's attitude toward
filing returns is included, as is a question designed to elicit a dollar figure

for hte value of all time, effort, and money spent on tax affairs. Finally, the
taxpayer was asked whether he or she had ever chosen not to undertake some business activity because of the hassle or expense of complying with tax laws.
A subset of the information collected in the survey is used in this study.
The precise definition of the variables considered is as follows:
Endogenous Van ables
H:

total hours spent on tax matters

B:

total dollar expenditure on professional tax assistance

TAX:

The interpretation of most of these variables is clear; some, though, merit

further conlnent. Responses to the age and education question were in ranges.

Each taxpayer was assigned the midpoint of the indicated range. Those indicating "over 65" were assigned an age of 70 and those indicating_graduate—level

education were assigned eighteen years. The marginal tax rate was calculated
from information about income reported by the taxpayer. The calculation takes
into account both the federal and state income tax and the possible deductibility of one tax in the calculation of taxable income for the other level of

government. Because a usable wage rate was not supplied on 46 percent of the
returned questionnaires, a wage equation was estimated for those who did

supply

a usable answer and used to impute a wage rate for those who did not.6 The exogenous variables in this equation were the income level, employment status,

occupation, age, level of education completed, marital status, and sex. The
marginal tax rate applied to the gross wage is the same as that described above
plus the social security tax.

All of the exogenous variables listed above are included in the vectors

-20-

z

and

H• The vector B includes all of the above except TIMEVAL.

5. Results
The results of the ordinary least-squares estimations are presented in
Table 1.

Two separate reduced—form equations were estimated for both own time

spent and for professional assistance purchased. One version (denoted A) includes all the exogenous variables plus a dumy variable for itemization status
(ITEM).

The second version (denoted B) includes all these variables plus an

interactive durriny term which is equal to the product of TAX and ITEM, called

TAXITEM

This particular interactive term is included because of the fact

that, for itemizers only, the tax rate affects not only the return to reducing
taxable income be one dollar but also directly aff'ects the effective price of

professional assistance.

The results shown in Table 1 indicate that age has a U—shaped relationship
with both time and money spent, reaching its minimum point at the age of thirty—

five for time spent and thirty-two for money spent. Thus for most of the range
of ages, compliance cost increases with age. More educated taxpayers tend,
ceteris paribus, to spend more of their own time on tax matters and less money

for assistance. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that more educated taxpayers are also more productive at tax matters than less educated

taxpayers. The same pattern, applies to married households: they spend more
time and less money than households not headed by a married couple. For the
most part, the results indicate that households with more complicated returns
(as measured by the presence of various sources of income) spend more time and

money on tax matters.7 Particularly strong associations exist between

compliance cost and the presence of self-employed business income and capital

gains or losses. Households with both sources of income spend approximately
thrity-two more hours and sixty—five more dollars than households with neither

source of income. The value of time variable is estimated to have a significant
positive association with monetary expense and a positive but not significant

affect on own hours spent. The theory would suggest that a high value of time
should induce substitution away from own time toward professional advice. The
fact that time spent is positively correlated with the after-tax wage rate may
be due to the fact that it is a better measure of competency in tax matters than
educational attainment, so that higher wage rate people have both a higher oportunity cost of time and a higher return to investing their time working on their
tax return.
In both Version A and B of the model, the estimated effect of the marginal

tax rate on hours spent is rather small and not statistically significant. On
the other hand, the regression equations do pick up a strong positive relationship between the tax rate and the amount of professional assistance

purchased. This is apparent in Version A, where an increase in the tax rate of
0.1 is associated with $16 moi-e dollars spent. In Version B, this association
is shown to be present only for itemizers, but is very large ($21 more with an
increase of 0.1) and significant for that group.

Finally, we note that, in Version A, the dumy variable for itemization is
positive and at least marginally significant. The magnitude of the implied
effect is large. Itemizers are estimated to spend 8.8 more hours on tax matters
and 24.3 more dollars. In Version B, the estimated impact of itemization
depends on the marginal tax rate. For a tax rate of 0.3, the estimated impact

is approximately the same as in Version A.

Table 2 contains the results of estimating the more general model outlined
in detail in Section 3.

In the first three columns are the results of esti-

mating the bivariate probit model of the choices of whether to itemize and

whether to hire professional assistance. The results of within-regime, ordinary
least—squares estimates with sample selection bias correction terms are presented in the last six columns.

Because of the multitude of coefficient estimates presented in Table 2, a

comprehensive discussion of all the results is infeasible. Instead we will
focus on the interesting relationships uncovered in the OLS estimations of Table
1, in order to compare the results obtained from the more TMcorrect" specifica-

tion of the empirical model.

The OLS estimates revealed an association between more complicated returns

and higher compliance costs. This was manifested by the negative coefficients
on EASY and the positive, large in magnitude, and statistically significant co-

efficients on SEBUS and CAPGL. The estimates of Table 2 indicate that the presence of a very simple return (EASY1) has a significant negative association
with the probability of hirin professional help for itemizers and, for itemizers who pay for help, a significant negative association with the amount of own

time spent on tax filing. The other relationships are not statistically significant. Having self—employment income (SEBUS=1) is positively associated with
hiring professional help for itemizers and has a strong positive effect on own
time spent for itemizers who pay for help and on the amount of professional

assistance purchased for all who purchase any help at all. Having capital gains
or losses (CAPGL1) has a statistically significant relationship only with the

amount of professional assis...tance purchased by itemizers.

The OLS regressions of Table 1 also suggested that the value of time had a
positive association with both H and B, though the estimated coefficients on H

were (just barely) statistically insignificant. The results in Table 2 indicate
that while TIMEVAL does not significantly affect the probability of purchasing
assistance, it is strongly positively associated with the amount purchased for
itemizers and positively, but not significantly, related to the amount purchased

for non—itemizers. The effect of TIMEVAL on own time spent is mixed. A higher
value of TIMEVAL increases the likelihood of being an itemizer, which is asso-

ciated with higher H. Given the regime, TIMEVAL has an insignificant positive
association with H, except for the non-itemizing, zero B, households for whom
there is a s.jgnificant negative relationship.

According to the OLS analysis, the marginal tax rate had no significant
association on own time spent but had a large and significant positive association with the amount of professional assistance purchased, especially for

itemizing households. The more correct empirical model allows us to decompose
these effects.
Evidently, the marginal tax rate has a clear association with the two
discrete decisions of whether to itemize and whether to purchase professional
assistance, but has a much less clear association wiht the choice of H and B for

given regimes. In particular, a higher marginal tax rate increases the likelihood of itemizing, and increases the likelihood of purchasing professional

assistance, though for itemizers only. The other statistically significant
coefficient estimate is that, for itemizers, the amount of professional
assistance purchased is positively associated with the marginal tax rate.

-28-

At the bottom of Table 2 we report the coefficients of the two selectivity

variables for each equation. In each case the first listed selectivity
variables is the expected value of the error term in the itemization probit

equation (tj), conditional on the regime chosen. The second listed selectivity
variable is the expected value of the error term in the professional assistance

probit equation (V1j for itemizers, and Nj for non—itemizers), conditional on
the regime chosen. The estimated coefficients on the selectivity variables are
significantly different from zero only in the H equation for households in

Regime 4 (non—itemizing, not paying for professional assistance). The negative
signs of the estimated coefficients indicate that there will be a tendency to
underestimate H when either the probability of itemization or the probability of
payirtg for professional assistance is overestimated.

The interpretation of the coefficients of each of the two selectivity
variables is the estimated covariance between the error in the two relevant pro—

bit equations and the error in the OLS equation. The inner product of the two
coefficient estimates and the expected value of the error terms is the estimate

of the expected unobservable component. For each of the six equations, this
value is very large in absolute value compared to the observed mean of the

dependent variable. This implies that the unobservable component of tax filing
behavior, for both time and money spent, is very large compared to the component

explained by the independent variables. In several cases these coefficients
imply implausible predicted behavior of a taxpayer in a regime other than the

one in which he is actually observed.
The large standard errors of the coefficients of the sample selection bias
correction terms suggest that these implausible predictions are due to the

-29-

multicollinearity of the estimate of the unobserved component of the choice of
regime decision and the determinants of the conditional continuous choice of H

and B. Remember that the same set of exogenous variables explain both the
choice of regime and the compliance behavior conditional on regime. That the
two relationships may be identified is entirely due to the non-linear rela-

tionship of the sample selection bias correction terms with the explanatory

variables. The essence of this phenomenom is that the estimation technique is
unable to precisely distinguish between the effect of the unobservable influen-

ces that determine the choice of regime and the effect of the explanatory
variables that affect behavior within a regime.
In order to further investigate this issue, several alternative estimation

strategies were pursued. First, observations with extreme outlying dependent
variables were omitted. Because the technique depends critically on the normality assumptions made about the error terms, extreme observations whose presence strains the plausibility of this distributional assumption might unduly

influence the results. Experimentation with deletion of outliers revealed that,
as expected, many of the results were quite sensitive to this procedure.
However, even with the deletion of five percent of the observations, the
existence of some implausible predicted behavior upon change of regime did not
disappear.

Another strategy we pursued was to impose certain restrictions on the very

general structure outlined in Section 3. The first one we considered was to
constrain the error covariances to be equal for all four H equations and to be

equal for both B equations. The reasoning underlying this constraint is that
the unobservable factor represents a taxpayer characteristic which will have the

-30-

same effect on how much assistance is purchased regardless of itemization status
and will also have the same effect on time spent regardless of itemization

status or whether professional assistance is purchased. The second set of
restrictions we considered served to constrain the coefficients on the explanatory variables, or a subset of the coefficients, to be identical across regimes.
None of these constraints altered our finding that the estimate unobervable
component dominates the observable component in a seeming1y capricious way.
This failure leads us back to the presence of multicollinearity and forces us
to conclude that there are insufficient obervations to enable us to distinguish
the unobservable determinants of choice of regime and the conditional effect of

the explanatory variables. Of course, this problem could undoubtedly be alleviated by arbitrarily altering the set of explanatory variables in the probit

and OLS equations. This procedure was, however, not accepted because of the
lack of any theoretical justification for differentiating between the two sets
of explanatory variables.

One simple way to further investigate the effect of including the sample
selection bias terms is to estimate the six OLS equations without these terms.

These estimates are presented in Table 3. Comparing the results to those of
Table 2, one notes that the pattern of coefficient estimates is broadly similar.
The demographic variables do not exhibit a strong or consistent effect on tax

compliance behavior. The presence of self—employment income has, for the most
part, a statistically significant positive effect on hours spent and especially

on the amount of professional assistance purchased. As in Table 2, the value of
time has a significant positive effect on professional assistance purchased for

itemizers, and an insignificant effect otherwise. The tax rate has a signifi-

cant positive association with professional assistance purchased, for itemizers,

and with time spent, for non-itemizers. Remember that in the results with
sample selection bias correction terms, the estimated effect of the tax rate on
time spent in Regime 4 was negative and insignificant.
There are two major areas of divergence between the results of Table 2 and

3. The first area is the constant terms, which are very different. This
reflects the phenomenon discussed above that the estimation technique of Table 2
indicates that there are very large unobservable effects on behavior, which are

offset by the effects of the observed independent variables, including the fixed

effect, or constant term. The second major area of divergence is the regression
explaining time spent by non—itemizers, non—payers for professional assistance
(Regime 4). When the sample selection bias correction terms are included,
several of the coefficients have an unexpected sign, such as EASY, SEBUS,

CAPGL, RENT, and TAX. In addition, some of the point estimates are implausibly
large in absolute value (RENT and PENANN). For the most part, these problems do
not arise in Table 3 when the sample selection bias correction terms are

deleted. (On the other hand the estimates of Table 3 are, of course, subject to
sample selection bias.) Our interpretation of this change is that the colli—
nearity of the correction terms with the set of other exogenous variables made
distinguishing the impact of the individual variables impossible on the basis of
the small sample size that is available.
What conclusions can be drawn from the regression results presented in

Tables 1, 2, and 3? Although the results from the different estimation
approaches are not in all cases consistent, some clear findings do emerge.
First, the presence of certain sources of income causes greater expenditure of

-33-

time and money on tax compliance. This is especially true for self-employment
income, and is also observed for capital gains income. A higher value of time,
which we expect to be associated with a substitution away from own time to the
use of professional assistance, is positively associated with the use of professional assistance in the simple OLS equations of Table 1, but when the regi-

mes are separated, this effect is found to be significant and large only for

itemizers. The estimated effect of the marginal tax rate on compliance behavior
is somewhat mixed. None of the techniques indicate a significant positive association between the tax rate and the amount of one's own time spent on tax

matters.8

The regressions do reveal, though, a positive association between

the marginal tax rate and the expenditure on professional tax assistance. The
probit estimates imply that, at least for itemizers, a higher tax rate

increases the likelihood of purchasing assistance. Furthermore, for itemizers
who do purchase assistance, the amount of assistance purchased does have a
significant and large association with the marginal tax rate.

6. Simulation of the Effect of Tax Simplification Proposals
In this section we use he results of the previous section to simulate the
likely impact on compliance costs of changes in the tax law aimed at simplifying

the filing process. In particular, we consider two law changes that have

recently attracted some policy interest. The first policy eliminates the system
of itemized deductions, to be replaced by a standard deduction for all taxpayers.9

The second policy is a "flat-rate" income tax system which combines

the elimination of itemized deductions, as in the first policy, with the further
institution of a constant marginal tax rate for all taxpayers.'°
Before discussing the simulation results, one important caveat must be men—

-34-

tioned. The sample population does not precisely represent the U.S. taxpaying
population in a number of dimensions. For example, the sample population has a
greater concentration of higher income households than the population as a whole
and the proportion of households who itemize their deductions is substantially

higher in the sample than in the U.S. If the rule that governs whether a given
household makes it into our sample (which undoubtedly depends on the household's
propensity to reply to a written questionnaire not unlike a tax form) is correlated with the dependent variable, then the parameter estimates may be biased.
For the purpose of simulation, the fact that the sample population overrepresents itemizers implies that the impact of eliminating the itemization option is

likely to be overestimated. Thus, in the computation of the figures that
follow, the sample was weighted so that proportion of itemizers is equal to the
U.S. proportion in 1982, 35.1 percent, and_so that the distribution of income
represents the income distribution of the U.S. taxpaying population.

For each of two policy changes, simulations using three different sets of

estimates will be calculated. The first two simulations are based on Versions A
and B of the OLS regressions of Table 1. The third simulation for each policy
change is based on the bivariate probit estimates presented in Table 2 (The
probit estimates are used to predict whether current itemizers will buy professional assistance when itemizing is not an option and to predict how changes
in the tax rate and the after—tax wage rate will affect the likelihood of buying
professional assistance.), and the OLS estimates by regime presented in Table 3.

The OLS estimates have the disadvantage of not being corrected for sample
selection bias, and have the advantage of avoiding the implausible predictions

of behavior of taxpayers who change regimes.

-35-

The simulated impact of eliminating itemized deductions is presented in the

top half of Table 4. For the OLS models of Table 1, this simulation simply
entails setting ITEM (and, in Version B, TAXITEM) to zero for all taxpayers.
For the third model, it entails predicting the behavior of current itemizers as
a weighted average of their predicted behavior according to the estimated structure of Regimes 3 and 4, the weights being the probability of paying for professional help, conditional on being a non—itemizer.
All three empirical models predict that eliminating the system of itemized

deductions will be accompanied by a substantial reduction in expenditures on
professional assistance, ranging from 39 percent according to model 18 to as low

as 28 percent according to model B. Note also that the percentage of taxpayers
that use professional assistance is predicted to decline by 12.6 percentage

points. The models have different predictions about the impact on taxpayer time
spent. While the OLS models of Table 1 predict a decline of per taxpayer hours
of slightly more than three, the regime by regime estimates with endogenous

regime selection predict a slight increase of 0.5 hours per taxpayer. All three
models predict that the total resource cost of compliance, which is calculated
by valuing time at the after-tax wage rate, declines, although the decline is
between fifteen and twenty percent for models 1A and B, but only slightly more
than one percent for model 3.

Not itemizing deductions would apparently save

some hours of record—keeping and also eliminate the primary reason that many

people seek professional help. A more important effect, though, is that it
increases the net price of professional tax assistance from (1—t)P8 to P8 for

former itemizers. For taxpayers in the 50 percent bracket, this amounts to a
doubling of the price per unit of professional tax assistance. Because current

itemizers account for 64 percent of payments for assistance in the weighted
sample, the substantial increase in price that accompanies the elimination of
itemization apparently would have a large aggregate impact.
The second policy that we investigate changes the rate structure of income
taxes from the present graduated one to one with a constant marginal tax rate of

0.20. The state tax system is assumed to be unchanged. A change in the tax
rate has direct effects on the probability of purchasing professional
assistance, and on the time and money spent on tax compliance, conditional on

the regime chosen. A change in the tax rate also has indirect effects on these

decisions because it changes the after-tax wage rate, the value of time. Note
also that the switch to this flat rate tax schedule d1oes not reduce everyone's

marginal tax rate. On the contrary, many low—income individuals.would
experience an increase in their marginal tax rate.

-

-

The simulations indicate that, although the flat—rate, no itemizing, tax

system would entail less resource cost than the current system, the flat—rate
tax schedule does not by iteseif reduce the aggregate cost of compliance by very

much, if at all. Models la and lb predict a small increase in both aggregate
hours spent and professional assistance purchased if the tax schedule is flat-

tened. Model 3 predicts a small decline in both time and money spent when the
rate schedule is changed. Compared to the policy of only eliminating itemization, the change in the resource cost of compliance is estimated at between a 2%
saving and a 6% additional cost.

There is one potentially significant reason that these results may underestimate the resource savings to be derived from a change to a flat-tax rate

schedule. It is that the analysis assumes that the taxpayer's sources of income

-38-

do not change when the marginal tax rate changes. To the extent that the
current rate structure induces individuals to engage in income earning activities which require a relatively high cost of compliance, the estimates presented
here will underestimate the resource savings.

7. Conclusions
Microeconornic data of the kind analyzed in this paper are potentially a

rich source of information about tax compliance behavior. Our analysis of tax
simplification suggests that significant resource savings can be expected from
eliminating the system of itemized deductions, although no saving from changing
to a single-rate tax structure can be confidently predicted.

As our introductory remarks emphasized, Information about the likely
resource savings of a particular tax simplification scheme is properly seen as

one input of many that should be considered by policy-rnakes. The allocational
and distributional impact of the changes must be weighed as well. It is hoped
that this research can begin the task of enriching the debate about tax
simplification by bringing to bear quantitative evidence on its benefits and
costs.

In this appendix we derive some of the comparative static implications

of the first-order conditions, (3a) and (3b) of the text. To do so we form
the total differentials of (3a) and (3b), allowing H, B, t, w1 (the after-tax

wage rate), and I to change. This procedure yields

1.

In defense of unpredictability, it is sometimes argued that it ensures

conservative decision—making on tax matters by risk-averse agents. This may be
preferable to the alternative of having explicit rules for every possible

situation (see Roberts, 1979). Stiglitz (1982) and Weiss (1976) have also
argued, on different grounds, that randomness in the tax law may be desirable
under certain circumstances.

2. The subsidization of homeownership due to the tax—exempt status of the
rental value of owner-occupied dwellings provides an example where the presence

of a tax expenditure is compatible with tax simplicity. Elimination of the subsidy by requirng taxpayers to estimate the imputed rental value would clearly
add to the administrative and compliance costs of the income tax system.

Disallowing the deductibility of mortgage interest payments would not eliminate
the subsidy to homeownership, only the subsidy to debt-financed homeownership.

3. The model therefore ignores expenses incurred in the process of tax
filing other than hiring professional advice, such as the cost of buying tax
guides or subscribing to news'letters that provide tax—related information.
4.

In orderto treat illegal tax evasion, the consumer problem would have

to be modelled as a choice under uncertainty, where the marginal expected utility from unpunished evasion is balanced against the (negative) marginal

expected utility of detection and the subsequent punishment for evasion. The
seminal paper on this issue is Allingham and Sandmo (1972). Cross and Shaw
(1981, 1982) argue that the problems of legal tax avoidance and illecal tax

evasion ought, from both a theoretical and policy perspective, to be treated
simultaneously

5. Although estimates of the coefficients of the reduced-form equations
(lOa)—(lOf) are sufficient for the purpose of making predictions about the

effect of various policy changes, it is interesting to inquire whether the coef-

ficients of the equations (7a)—(7d) can be identified. (Equations (7a)-(7d) are
not truly structural because they contain elements of both the utility function

and the compliance technologies.) In fact, this structure of the model is such
that they in fact can all be identified (Sickles and Schmidt, 1978).

To see this, we first consider equations (lOa)-(lOc). Note that the ordinary least-squares estimation of (lOc) yields a consistent estimate of the vec-

vector a3. Note further that, for any element of

1:

k(

+

all

:

+

k(a11

+

ii)

But the bracketed terms in the above expression are equal to the coefficients of
X,

in (lOb) and (lOa), respectively. Thus, the estimate of an element of a11

in addition to the reduced-form estimates of (lOa) and (lOb) enable us to iden-

tify aj. So in this model the parameters of the H equations, (7a) and (7c),

are identified without the usual exclusion restrictions. In fact, a is over-

identified, since each of the elements of a and

provides an estimate of

aj

Identification of the parameters of the B equations does, however, require

the usual restrictions. Fortunately, there is a natural exclusion restriction
because the after-tax wage rate does not affect B, given H; it does, though,
affect H, given B.

6. There is a substantial literature, based on the theory of labor supply,
concerned with imputing wage rates to nonworking women based on their charac-

teristics and the wage rate and characteristics of working women. However,
direct application of that methodology to the problem at hand seems
inappropriate because there is no clear distinction between those for whom a

wage rate is available and those for whom it is not available. (Examples of
unusable replies to the wage rate question are "time—and—a—half," "retired," or

"variab1e. Others left the answer space blank.) Thus it is invalid to claim
that the reservation wage of those with no wage rate available (because they
are not working) must be greater than the wage rate that could be earned.

7. In interpreting the coefficients on the sources of income variables, it
is important to bear in mind that EASY takes on a value of one only when none of

the sources of income is present. Thus, for example, the estimated irTact of
having dividends, compared to having no non—wage income, is found by subtracting
the coefficient on EASY from the coefficient on DIV.

8. The notable exception is the significantly positive estimated

coefficient n TAX in Regime 4 of Table 3.
9. The standard deductibn may, as it does now, vary depending on certain
taxpayer characteristics. What is important is that the appropriate deduction
is trivially easy to calculate.
10. The corrrnon federal marginal income tax rate is assumed to be 0.20. The
total marginal tax rate includes the appropriate Minnesota tax, which is assumed
to be unchanged.
