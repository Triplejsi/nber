Diversity and Donations: The Effect of Religious and Ethnic Diversity on Charitable Giving
James Andreoni, Abigail Payne, Justin D. Smith, and David Karp
NBER Working Paper No. 17618
November 2011
JEL No. H41,J11,R23
ABSTRACT
We explore the effects of local ethnic and religious diversity on individual donations to private charities.
Using 10-year neighborhood-level panels derived from personal tax records in Canada, we find that
diversity has a detrimental effect on charitable donations. A 10 percentage point increase in ethnic
diversity reduces donations by 14%, and a 10 percentage point increase in religious diversity reduces
donations by 10%. The ethnic diversity effect is driven by a within-group disposition among non-minorities,
and is most evident in high income, but low education areas. The religious diversity effect is driven
by a within-group disposition among Catholics, and is concentrated in high income and high education
areas. Despite these large effects on amount donated, we find no evidence that increasing diversity
affects the fraction of households that donate. Over the period studied, ethnic diversity rises by 6 percentage
points and religious diversity rises by 4 percentage points; our results suggest that charities receive
about 12% less in total donations. As areas like North America continue to grow more diverse over
time, our results imply that these demographic changes may have significant implications for the charitable
sector.

I - Introduction
Diversity is increasingly a fact in urban centers across North America and Europe, and is often
lauded as a virtue in and of itself. Recent research suggests, however, that despite other potential
positive benefits, diversity appears to dilute support for publicly funded goods and services. Ethnically
diverse communities appear to spend less on schools (Alesina, Baqir, Easterly, 1999 & 2000; Poterba,
1997, Goldin & Katz, 1999), less on roads and hospitals (Alesina, Baqir, Easterly, 1999 & 2000), and
to have lower Census form completion rates (Vigdor, 2004).
Does a decrease in support for publicly provided goods indicate a similar decline in private
provision of public goods, like local charitable services? Using standard models of group affiliation
(Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000), the prediction is not clear. If people prefer to sort into social groups
that are similar to themselves in terms of ethnicity, religion, or income, then increased diversity may
mean that individuals are more likely to become increasingly willing to give to charitable causes that
benefit their own group, such as local religious organizations or neighborhood food banks.
Alternatively, if the charities are seen as helping those outside their group, then the same insular
feelings that lead to less support for publicly provided goods may pervade attitudes toward giving to
private charities as well.
We study the effect of ethnic and religious diversity on individuals’ donations to private
charities. We use aggregated data on charitable donations derived from Canadian tax records linked to
Census data over 10 year time periods. Canada is an ideal place to study questions about diversity.
First, Canada is one of the world’s most diverse nations. It actively promotes multiculturalism and is
more open to immigration than most developed nations. Second, the data from the charitable sector in
Canada are perhaps the most complete and precise data on charitable organizations available, updated
annually. Third, the Canadian Census is collected once every five years, information on ethnicity and
religion is detailed, and data can be linked relatively easily over time. Moreover, the Census areas are
2

relatively small. As a result, key information needed to study diversity is both more detailed and more
frequently updated than data from other countries, like in the United States.
Our empirical model is based on Vigdor (2002, 2004), where community-level regressions are
an aggregated version of an individual-level model with donations modeled as a function of a person’s
own ethnic or religious group share of the population. The advantage of this approach is that we can
make statements about average individual behavior even though we use aggregated data. Furthermore,
as we show below it provides a natural motivation for using a Fragmentation Index (FI) to measure
diversity. This measure is useful because it is widely used in the literature and also because it is easily
interpreted as the probability that any two randomly-selected individuals in the community belong to
different groups.
The average adult in our sample donates almost $200 per year. We find that increasing the
ethnic FI by 10 percentage points reduces the average donation per adult by roughly $27 per year, a
14% reduction. By contrast, we find no statistically significant relationship between changes in the
ethnic FI and the fraction of households that make a donation. Ethnic diversity appears, therefore, to
affect the intensive rather than extensive margin. Looking deeper into which groups drive this effect,
we find that non-minorities contribute roughly $92 more per adult when their group share increases by
10 percentage points in the community, and Blacks contribute $390 more for the same increase in their
group share. By contrast, East Asians contribute $111 less per adult when their group share increases
by 10 percentage points. Finally, the effects are strongest in high income and low education
communities.
Turning to religious diversity, a 10 percentage point increase in the FI reduces contributions by
about $20 per adult per year, a 10% reduction, though this estimate is noisy. Catholics increase their
donations by $69 per adult when their share in the population rises by 10 percentage points. We again
find no evidence that religious diversity affects the fraction of households that donate.
3

In sum, our results indicate that the deleterious effects of diversity on public sector provision of
goods extends to privately provided public goods as well. Increases in ethnic and religious diversity
lead to significant declines in charitable giving in the urban Canadian areas in our sample. Over the ten
years of our study, ethnic diversity increased by six percentage points, and religious diversity by four
percentage points. Our estimates would suggest that, due to the negative effects of diversity on giving,
the charities we study receive twelve percent less in donations.
II – Existing Literature
Many studies on diversity focus on the relationship between diversity and the amount or
distribution of public spending by governments or, more recently, on contributions or attitudes towards
activities or goods that generate public benefits (See reviews by Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005,
Stichnoth and Van der Straeten, 2009). The main conclusion from the literature is that diversity
reduces publicly provided goods, both across countries and across communities within a country
(mainly the United States). Ethnically diverse communities are found to spend less on schools (Alesina,
Baqir, Easterly, 1999 & 2000; Poterba, 1997, Goldin & Katz, 1999), less on roads (Alesina, Baqir,
Easterly, 1999 & 2000), and less on social programs in general as a fraction of GDP (Alesina, Glaeser,
and Sacerdote, 2001). One exception is that Cutler et al. (1993) find that changes in state-level
demographic characteristics have a negative effect on public spending, but at the county level the effect
is positive.
A related literature also finds that diversity has a negative impact on individual behavior when
there are public benefits involved. In racially or ethnically heterogeneous communities, involvement in
social activities is lower (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000), people are less likely to fill out census forms
(Vigdor, 2004), they contribute less to schools through voluntary fundraising events (Miguel and
Gugerty, 2005), and contribute less to community organizations (Okten and Osili, 2004). There are
several explanations offered for this effect. If different groups have different tastes or agendas for
4

public spending, then this disagreement may make it more difficult to raise the funds necessary to
provide those goods, and may make the goods themselves more costly1 (such as multilingual
education), and so overall provision is lower (Alesina et al. 1999). Other researchers have suggested
that individuals may be less willing to contribute to a good with public benefits if those benefits accrue
to other groups besides their own. There may be mistrust across groups (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2002,
Fershtman and Gneezy, 2001) or pro-social within-group norms that are not easily enforceable across
groups (Habyarimana et al., 2007).
Several studies focus specifically on the relationship between diversity and altruistic behavior.
Hungerman (2009) finds evidence that charitable spending by all-white church congregations is more
sensitive to increases in the percent of the local community that is Black compared to more diverse
congregations. In an interesting contrast, Hungerman (2008) finds that government spending on
charities is less likely to crowd out charitable spending by United Methodist Churches in more
ethnically diverse communities. Experimental evidence by Fong and Luttmer (2009) shows that
giving to Hurricane Katrina victims is higher when the giver and recipient have the same racial
background, but there is no effect of race on the decision to give. In a different experiment, Fong and
Luttmer (2011) found that while non-Black participants view Black individuals as less worthy of
charity, it did not translate into less giving.
III – Empirical Strategy
We are able to use our data to potentially draw shaper conclusions than prior studies. First, we
are able to consider a broader set of charities than churches alone. Second, U.S.-based studies are
limited by the racial categories available in the Census: Black, White, Hispanic, American Indian, and

1

A nice example from Jackson (2010) is a fragmented community where some individuals want to provide public education
in one language, and other individuals want to provide it in another. It may be more costly to devise a system where
education is delivered in multiple languages compared to a more homogeneous community that funds education in one
language.

5

Asian/Pacific Islander. By contrast, the Canadian Census data have a broader set of groups available.
Third, Canada collects very comprehensive religious affiliation in the Census every 10 years, whereas
U.S. Census data has no measure for religion.
Our empirical analysis is based on Vigdor (2002, 2004), who builds a community-level model
by aggregating an individual-level model. The main advantages of this exercise are that it provides a
behavioral interpretation to the coefficients we get from the community-level model, and motivates the
use of a Fragmentation Index (FI), which is the most common way to measure diversity.
Suppose that the amount individual i in group g from community c at time t donates to charity
depends on the fraction of the community members who are in the same group:

where donationigct is an individual’s donation to any charity in dollars, and sharegct is the share of
group g in the population in community c at time t. Vigdor (2002) calls

the within-group affinity,

because it measures the extra amount a person is willing to donate when their group’s share in the
population increases. The coefficient
variables in

measures each group’s baseline contribution level. The

are individual-level factors affecting donations, such as income, and

are

community-level factors that may or may not vary over time.
Aggregating to the community-year level, we get

̅

̅ .

The overbars indicate community-level weighted averages at time t, where the weights are the group
shares in the community. In the aggregate, community-level donations are a function of the shares and

6

the squared shares, where the baseline and affinity effects are the coefficients on those shares. Use of
the FI as a regressor is motivated by restricting all of the squared shares to have the same effect,

̅

The FI is 1

∑

, so we can interpret –

̅

as the effect of increasing heterogeneity

on donations. It measures the average effect of the individual squared shares. In practice, we estimate
models with and without the restriction that the squared shares have the same effect. In the regressions
where we restrict the coefficients on the squared shares to be the same we will use the FI as the main
independent variable (rather than the sum of the squared shares) for interpretation purposes. Note that
because aggregation creates heteroskedastic errors, we use standard errors that are heteroskedasticity
robust and clustered at the community level.2
We control for the time varying factors in ̅

and

using data from the Census on the

variables most likely to be related to donations (discussed below). Additionally, we control for timeinvariant community factors in

with a set of community-level fixed effects. Our identifying

restrictions, therefore, are that the controls account for all time-varying factors that are related to both
diversity and donations, and any remaining unobservable measures are controlled adequately through
community-level fixed effects. For example there may be fundamental unobservable differences
between neighborhoods in Toronto and Kitchener in terms of both their diversity and charitable nature
that do not change over time; the fixed effects will control for these differences. One remaining issue
for identification is sorting across neighborhoods. Since our use of community fixed effects should
absorb most of the effects of sorting, we can maintain identification as long as there is no significant
migration based on charitableness of communities during our sample period. In particular, if more

2

7

charitable communities attract more diverse populations, then or estimates will be biased toward
finding a positive relationship between diversity and donations. As we show later, this is a minor
concern as the data does not suggest migration of this sort.

IV – Data
In this section we report the sources of our data, how we selected the sample for analysis, and provide
summary statistics for the observations we analyze.
IV.A – Data Description
Data on donations come from the Summary of Charitable Donors, produced by Statistics
Canada. The dataset contains information on yearly total amounts contributed by residential
households, and number of contributors to charity aggregated to the Forward Sortation Area (FSA)
level (discussed below) from individual tax records.3 Data at this level of aggregation are only available
for FSAs in urban areas.4 We extract information on total amount contributed and total number of
contributors to registered charities for tax years 1991-2006. Registered charities include regular
charitable organizations providing any type of service, but also amateur athletic organizations,
universities inside and outside of Canada, tax exempt housing corporations in Canada, municipalities,
the United Nations, and charities outside of Canada that have been given a gift by the Government of
Canada (Statistics Canada, 2007).

3

Specifically, information is based on line 340 of T1 federal tax forms.
Statistics Canada produces the charitable donors data in such a way that users can aggregate to different levels, including
the city level. Because some FSAs straddle city borders, sometimes our data splits an FSA’s observation between all cities
within its border in a given year. In creating our sample, we simply added the donations across cities within an FSA
boundary in a given year. It is possible, however, that if a city within an FSA is very small, Statistics Canada could have
suppressed its data. To check whether the results were robust to excluding these areas, we reran all regressions eliminating
FSAs that straddled city borders (about 20% of the observations), and the results were very similar to those presented in the
manuscript. One notable exception is that the coefficient on the Religion Fragmentation Index in Table IX becomes
statistically significant, at roughly the same magnitude.
4

8

From these data we create our two main outcome variables. First is the average donation per
adult, which we compute by dividing total donations by the adult (15+) population in each year.5 We
also divide number of charitable donors by the number of households to create our second outcome, the
fraction of households who donate. We divide by the number of households instead of the number of
individuals because of the tax treatment of charitable donations. Charity tax credits are transferrable
between spouses. Because the tax credit rates jump substantially after passing a monetary threshold, it
is most likely the case that one spouse claims all of the tax credits and the other spouse claims none.6
We therefore expect, as far as tax records are concerned, the number of donors more accurately reflects
the total number of households who donate, rather than the number of individuals.
There are several unique features of donations data based on tax records. First, we cannot
identify the charity to which donations have been made. For example, donating to an arts organization
is equivalent to donating to a food bank or a church. This could be problematic if some types of
donations are sensitive to community composition and others are not. Donations also include those
made to large, international organizations, which again may not be sensitive to the composition of a
local community.
Second, because data on donations are based on tax records, only donations reported on an
individual’s tax return are counted, and only for individuals who file a tax return. According to
documentation accompanying the charitable donors’ data, 66% of Canadians filed taxes in 1991, which
climbed to 74% in 2006. This may not be a substantial issue, however, because of the tax treatment of
donations discussed above: some individuals who do not file a tax return may have a spouse who does,

5

In dividing total contributions derived from tax records by a measure of the adult population, we assume that people who
do not file a tax return have a contribution of zero. Alternatively, this measure could simply be interpreted as tax-receipted
donations per person.
6
This is especially true if one spouse earns no income as the tax credit is non-refundable. The threshold levels and rates
vary over time. The thresholds are in the $200 to $250 range, the rate below the threshold is around 15%-17%, and the tax
credit rate roughly doubles for all dollars above the threshold.

9

and that spouse may claim the donation on his/her tax return. We are, therefore, likely picking up more
donations than the rate of filing might suggest.7
We link data on donations to variables from the 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006 Census of Canada
aggregated to the FSA level. Statistics Canada collects data on a small number of variables such as
basic population counts and gender from 100% of the population (the “short form”), and other more
detailed information using a mandatory 20% sample (the “long form”).8 Data on ethnic groups,
collected through the long form, is based on an individual’s “visible minority” status, which assigns
people to one of twelve groups based mainly on skin tone. Because some groups are quite small, we
regroup individuals into the following categories: Black, East/Southeast Asian, South Asian,
Arab/West Asian, Latin American, Other, and not-visible-minority.9 Religious groups, also collected
on the long form, contain a much larger number of disaggregated categories, which we regroup for the
same reasons into: Catholic, Christian (other than Catholic), Jewish, Muslim, Other, and not religious.10
Data for visible minorities are available in the 1996, 2001, and 2006 Censuses, and data for religious
groups are available for 1991 and 2001.
We draw all of our control measures from the Census. These include household income, family
structure, education, external and internal residential mobility, unemployment, population distribution,
language, housing stock, house values, home ownership, and rent. All controls are listed in Table I.

7

We also control for the fraction of the population that files taxes in all regressions, to make sure we are comparing
communities with similar filing rates.
8
Note, however, that in 2011 the long form portion of the Census was replaced with a voluntary survey of 30% of the
population called the National Household Survey. The short form remains mandatory.
9
The groups available in the Census are: Chinese, South Asian, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Arab,
West Asian, Korean, Japanese, Visible Minority Not Included Elsewhere, and Multiple Visible Minority. Individuals who
report multiple visible minority groups or are not included elsewhere are sorted into the “other” group. Non-visibleminorities include Aboriginal peoples.
10
The groups are: Catholic ,United, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, Reform, Orthodox, Jehovah’s
Witness, Mennonite, Salvation Army, Mormon, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Other, and No
Religion.

10

Our data are aggregated to the FSA level, which is a relatively small geographic space used to
delineate postal routes. An FSA is the first three characters of the 6-digit Canadian postal code, where
the first identifies the province (in most cases) and the second identifies the area as urban or rural.
There are roughly 1,600 FSAs across Canada, and each is a relatively stable geographic area containing
only 7,000 households on average. FSAs in rural locations tend to occupy large areas, while those in
urban areas can be very small. Though they are generally stable, some FSAs do change boundaries
over time. This occurs mostly where an urban FSA is created out of part of a rural FSA, but urban FSA
are occasionally, though seldom, split into 2 or more urban FSAs. We refer to these as emerging FSAs.
Our solution to this was to regroup emerging FSAs back into their old boundaries, and use those
boundaries for all years. A detailed explanation of this procedure is available in Appendix B.11
IV.B – Sample
Our sample universe consists of all urban FSAs between 1991 and 2006, the years when both
donations and Census data are available.12 There are 19,668 FSA-year observations over that time
period, or 1,269 FSAs. From this universe, we drop 1,159 observations (5.9%) where one of the key
Census measures contained missing data; 1,048 further observations (5.3%) from FSAs that are
missing donations data in one of the Census years; a final 353 observations (1.8%) that do not have a
link to Census data in at least one year. After these exclusions, we are left with 17,108 FSA-year
observations on charitable donations. Finally, a small number of emerging FSAs were regrouped with
other urban FSAs, leaving a final sample of 17,071 FSA-year observations.
Because Census data are only available in 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006, whereas donations data
are available for all years, we linearly interpolate Census measures between Census years. Visible

11

For example, splitting an urban FSA into two but maintaining the same label for one of them, we might observe what
appears to be large population drops or changes in other variables. But, this would simply be a product of redrawing
boundaries. By regrouping FSAs back into their own boundaries, we avoid such issues.
12
This sample restriction also excludes FSAs that were regrouped back into rural FSAs, as explained in Appendix B.

11

minority information was not collected in 1991, so we therefore do not interpolate this measure
between 1991 and 1996. Likewise, religion information was not collected in 1996 or 2006, so we do
not interpolate between 2001 and 2006 for this measure. Because visible minority and religion data do
not fully overlap, we use different samples to analyze ethnic and religious diversity. To study ethnic
diversity, we use 12,056 FSA-year observations between 1996 and 2006. To study religious diversity,
we use 11,033 FSA-year observations between 1991 and 2001.
IV.C - Summary Statistics
In Table I, Panel A, we present means of donation-related variables. Average donations per
adult (converted to constant year 2000 Canadian Dollars) increased by 79% between 1991 and 2006,
with most of the growth occurring between 1996-2006. On the other hand, the fraction of households
who make any donation falls by roughly 8 percentage points over the same period.
In Table I, Panel B, we summarize Census information. Our key measure of diversity is the FI,
which measures the probability that any two randomly selected individuals are in different groups. In
1996 there was on average a 22% chance of two people being from different visible minority groups,
which climbs to 28% by 2006. There is much more diversity among religious groups: in 1991 there
was a 53% chance on average that individuals belong to different religious groups, which rose to 57%
by 2001. While the baseline level of diversity is much higher in terms of religion, growth in diversity
is higher in terms of visible minority status.
We also present statistics showing changes over time in control measures that are related to
diversity and donations. Some noteworthy changes are that average household income grows by
roughly $5600, the fraction of the population who are immigrants grows by 4 percentage points, the
fraction with a university education grows by 7 percentage points, and housing value grows by roughly
$56,000.
12

In Table II we take a closer look at the distribution of donations and diversity. In Panel A, we
report the overall distribution of each variable, pooling together FSAs over time. The overall mean
level of donations is roughly $205 and is quite variable, with the 10th percentile average donation of
about $55, and the 90th percentile of $364. The visible minority FI standard deviation of 0.218 is
roughly the size of its mean, 0.254. Religious FI has a slightly smaller standard deviation, but it is less
than half the size of its mean.
Panels B and C of Table II examine the distributions of these variables between and within
FSAs. It is clear from comparing Panels B and C to Panel A that there is substantial variation between
communities. The within-FSA standard deviations are much smaller than the between-FSA standard
deviations. It is also interesting, but perhaps not surprising given the short period of our sample, that
the diversity measures in do not show a large amount of variation over time.
To help visualize diversity in Canada, Figure I shows the spatial distribution of ethnic diversity
in the Golden Horseshoe (the populated area around Lake Ontario, including Toronto).13 Prior to
compiling the Figure, we grouped all FSAs into quintiles based on their FI, and represented by the
different colors. The delineated areas in the Figure are FSAs, and darker shades of yellow represent
more diverse areas. The most diverse communities are those located near Toronto; as one moves farther
away from the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), communities become more homogeneous. In similar maps
not reported, for other cities we do notice variance in this pattern across city size and geographic
location in Canada.
In Table III we present data on the demographic shifts over time. Recall that the FI is the sum
of the squared visible minority or religion shares. Panel A shows baseline shares in 1996 and the
change in the shares over 10 years for visible minority groups. Clearly the largest group is non-visibleminorities with an 85.47% share. East/Southeast Asian is the next largest with 6.43%. South Asians

13

are roughly 3% of the population, Blacks are 2.6%, and other groups are smaller. The largest visible
minority groups are also the fastest growing: the East/Southeast Asian group increases its population
share by roughly 32%, and the South Asians increase their share by about 67%. Column 3 reports how
many of the FSAs in the sample experience growth in each of the groups listed. Generally speaking,
about 60% to 70% of FSAs in the sample have growing visible minority shares. Offsetting this growth
is a shrinking non-visible-minority group: they lose 5.6% of their share and only 12.5% of FSAs see
growth in this group over time.
Religious groups do not move as uniformly. Catholics are the largest group with 45% of the
population in 1991, which shrinks slightly over the subsequent 10 years. Combined, all other Christian
religions make up 35.76% of the population in 1991, which also shrinks over time. On the other hand,
individuals claiming no religion, who comprise 13.72% of the population in 1991, increase their share
over time. Perhaps the most telling statistic is that 91.03% of all FSAs in the sample increase their
share of individuals reporting no religion.
Table IV presents the mean relationship between diversity and donations. The first three
columns break up the visible minority FI into three quantiles and recomputes the means from Table I.
We see donations are higher and more people donate in more ethnically diverse FSAs. A similar
pattern is observed in columns 4-6, which separate the data by religious diversity. However, changes
in means of the other variables across the quantiles suggest that this may not be a causal relationship, in
particular because income is also higher in diverse neighborhoods. What is likely the case here is that
more diverse neighborhoods are also the major urban centers like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver,
which will have more diverse and wealthier populations. We control for these factors in the regression
analysis below.
V – Results

14

In next two subsections we first look at ethnic diversity, then religious diversity, both using the
Fragmentation Index of diversity. In the third subsection we reconsider these results with a different
index meant to capture concentration or polarization of communities.
V.A – Ethnic Diversity
In Table V we present regressions of average donations on diversity using various
specifications that add increasing amounts of control variables, and then use squared shares instead of
the FI. Column 1 is a simple OLS regression of donations on visible minority FI without controls
(except year effects), which we use a baseline for comparison. As we saw in the summary statistics,
there is a positive relationship between diversity and donations in this simple regression. The
coefficient on FI measures the effect of moving from complete homogeneity (FI = 0) to complete
heterogeneity (FI = 1). Column 2 adds a set of control variables from the Census; this changes the
sign of the coefficient from positive to negative. Our preferred specification is in column 3, which
adds FSA fixed effects to the control measures in the previous specification. Estimates from this
specification imply that an increasing of 0.1 in the FI visible minority diversity measure lowers the
average donation per adult by about $27 (that is, 271.02 times 0.1). This represents a 14 percent drop
in average donations per adult, which we consider to be a substantial effect. To put this into
perspective between 1996 and 2006 ethnic diversity in Canada increased by 0.06 points, which our
results suggests lowered giving in urban areas by eight percent.
In column 4, we generalize the specification to allow the squared shares to enter separately into
the regression. These coefficients are interpreted as the change in a particular group’s willingness to
donate when the share of its own group in the population increases from zero to 100%. Identifying the
squared shares separately is more difficult when using fixed effects since, as the summary statistics
suggested, they do not vary substantially over time. For this reason, few of these coefficients are
statistically significant. Two notable exceptions are that an increase of 10 percentage points in the
15

share of non-minorities increases donations by $111 for this group, and a 10-point increase in the share
Black increases donations by $390.14 On the other hand, other visible minority groups display group
aversion. A 10 percentage point increase in the East Asian group reduces donations by roughly $111.
Others are not statistically significant. Therefore, while the result from column 3 suggests that on
average groups are more willing to donate when their group share rises, not all groups display the same
pattern.
In columns 5 and 6 we check the robustness of our results to the linear interpolation between
Census years. Recall that for visible minorities the Census is only observed in 1996, 2001, and 2006.
Values in other years are interpolated. When we restrict the sample to only years when the Census data
are observed, we get very similar results, though less statistically significant in general. We are thus
confident that our results are not driven by the linear interpolation procedure.
Digging deeper into what might be driving the diversity effect, in Table VI we break the sample
into quantiles based on household income and university education then analyze those subsamples
separately. Columns 1 to 3 show that while the diversity effect is negative for all income quantiles, the
strongest effect occurs in the richest FSAs, though these results are not statistically significant.15 Table
VI also reports on subsamples of the data based on the fraction of individuals in the FSA with a
university education. We see that the effect is highest in communities where university education is
low.
Tables VII and VIII repeat the previous two tables using the fraction of households that donate
as the dependent variable. In Table VII, our preferred specification is column 3, which reports

14

While the coefficient on share Black appears large relative to the overall mean donation, it would be more appropriate to
compare to the mean among Black individuals in the sample. Due to the aggregated nature of our data, we are not able to
compute the average donation among Black individuals in the sample. Thus, it is unclear whether this coefficient is large or
small.
15
There are several possible explanations for this. The first is simply that wealthy individuals donate more to charity and
are more likely to give, which creates greater ability to reduce giving.

16

coefficients from regressions of fraction of households who donate on the visible minority FI, a set of
Census controls, year effects, and FSA fixed effects. Here we find no statistically significant effect.
Breaking out the FI into squared shares, we see that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black share
increases probability of donation by about 18 percentage points, and a 10 percentage point increase in
the Other share increases probability of donation by about 81 percentage points. Other coefficients are
statistically insignificant.
Table VIII breaks the sample into quantiles based on household income and education. The
most notable result in this table is that increasing the FI by 0.1 leads to a 3.3 percentage point drop in
the fraction of households who donate in FSAs with low levels of university education. This is
consistent with the result for donations reported in Table VI.
Overall, the results indicate that on average, charitable giving is sensitive to the demographic
composition of the community. We find evidence that the propensity to donate and the amount of the
donation are sensitive to the ethnic makeup of the community, though not all groups are sensitive in the
same way. Indeed, some groups actually donate less when their group share increases. On average,
however, the population does show group affinity.
V.B – Religious Diversity
Table IX reports the results of regressions where both average donations and fraction of
households who donate are regressed on diversity measures. For brevity, we report only the results
from our preferred specifications, which include fixed FSA effects and Census controls. Using the FI
as our diversity measure, we find that increasing religious diversity by 0.1 reduces average donations
per adult by $20, but this coefficient is imprecisely measured. Using squared shares instead of the FI,

17

we find that Catholics have a statistically significant positive group affinity. Though none of the
coefficients on other groups are statistically significant, some are positive and some are negative.16
In Table IX we also report that the fraction of households who donate is relatively insensitive to
religious fragmentation. In specifications that use squared group shares separately, we find that a 0.1
increase in the non-religious population leads to a 15.2 percentage point drop in non-religious
household donations, and a similar increase the fraction of Others lowers Other household donations by
7 percentage points. A 0.1 increase in the share Christian, on the other hand, decreases donations by 6
percentage points. Again, not all others display a group affinity, but on average the increasing diversity
reduces the fraction of households who donate by a small amount.
In Table X, we break up the sample by income and education quantiles and estimate models
with donations per adult as the dependent variable. Though coefficients are generally not significant,
the pattern is that more high income and high education neighborhoods have stronger responses to
increased religious diversity. In Table XI we find no real evidence that the diversity effect varies
across income and education groups.
To this point we have estimated the effect of ethnic and religious diversity in separate
specifications, the primary reason being data limitations. To the extent that these two measures are
correlated, part of the observed effect of ethnic diversity may actually be a religious effect, and vice
versa. To explore this possibility, in Table XII we estimate specifications with both measures of
diversity. For this exercise we use only data from 1996-2001, the time period when both visible
minority and religion data are available. In columns 1 and 2 we use the new sample to estimate our
preferred fixed effects specification with ethnic and religious diversity entering separately, for

16

We also generated estimates based on two alternative groupings of religions. In the first, we simply joined Catholics with
the Christian group. In the second, we decompose Christians into finer groups, and also regroup the other religions. Results
and descriptions of the new groups are in Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2. The coefficient on FI remains negative, but the
magnitude is stronger when Catholics are grouped with Christians.

18

comparison purposes. In column 3, we include both diversity measures in the regression. When both
are included, we find that a 0.1 unit increase in ethnic diversity reduces donations by $48, whereas a
0.1 unit increase in religious diversity reduces donations by $11, though the latter is not statistically
significant. Comparing to columns 1 and 2, we see that the ethnic diversity coefficient is higher, but
the religion coefficient is significantly smaller in magnitude. Thus, while the effect of each measure on
donations partly reflects the effect of the other, each continues to exert an independent effect on
donations.
V.C – Diversity or Polarization?
While our model motivates our use of the FI, we estimate models with an alternative measure of
community diversity frequently found in the literature called the RQ index (Montalvo & ReynalQuerol, 2002), which is defined as:

0.5  sharekjt 2
RQ jt  1  
 sharekjt
0.5

k 1 
.
K

Whereas the FI measures fragmentation, RQ measures polarization. The difference is best
illustrated by example. Suppose there are three ethnic groups in the population. FI takes a maximum
when the population is divided equally among the groups, whereas RQ takes a maximum when the
population is divided equally among only two of the groups. The distinction between fractionalization
and polarization could prove important if it is really two opposing groups that matter, rather than
diversity spread over many groups.
Despite the differences in interpretation, both measures are highly correlated at low values of
the FI, not correlated at middle values, and negatively correlated at high values. Thus, relatively
homogenous societies that become more diverse also initially become more polarized, but highly
diverse societies that become more diverse can become less polarized.
19

The results of regressions with the RQ index are presented in Table XIII. Using the visible
minority sample in Panel A, we estimate that ethnic polarization also reduces average charitable
donations per adult. A 0.1 change in this index reduces donations by roughly $17. Note that this index
is not in the same scale as the FI, so the coefficients are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, the
effect is in the same direction, which is not surprising because at low levels of the FI, the two measures
are highly correlated. Similar to prior results, polarization does not have a statistically significant
effect on the fraction of households who donate.
In Panel B, we show that an increase in religious polarization by 0.1 reduces donations by $13.
By contrast, more polarized communities are estimated to increase the probability of donation slightly.
A 0.1 increase in the RQ index increases the fraction of households who donate by 1 percentage point.
This result is in direct contrast to the regressions using FI, but are not surprising since at high values of
the FI the two measures are negatively correlated. A more polarized community in this case is a less
fragmented one, so to the extent that it is fragmentation that matters, the opposite sign is expected.
VII – Conclusion
In this paper we examine the relationship between ethnic diversity, religious diversity, and
charitable donations. Previous literature has shown that publicly provided goods can be lower in
jurisdictions that are more heterogeneous along these dimensions. Our results confirm this finding in
the case of privately provided public goods, in particular private charity. We find that the average
donation per adult in our sample drops by $27 per year when the ethnic FI increases by 0.1 points. This
adds up to a substantial drop in the level of this public good. This effect is mainly driven by nonminorities, who contribute $9 less for each percentage point their group share drops, and Blacks, who
contribute $39 less. The average effect of ethnic diversity on donations occurs most strongly in high
income, and in low education neighborhoods. We find no evidence that ethnic diversity affects
donations per household on average.
20

We also estimate that more religious diversity might also lower contributions. We find
significant evidence that Catholics are more willing to donate when their group share rises in the
population. The effect of religious diversity on donations per adult is highest in high income and
highly educated neighborhoods, though these estimates are less precise than the estimates based on
ethnic diversity.
Our results imply that the recent and continuing demographic changes across North America
and Europe may have a significant and sizable impact on charitable services provided through
voluntary contributions of individuals. As communities grow more diverse, charity revenues may fall.
This raises further public policy concerns, especially in urban areas, as religious and ethnic diversity
inevitably grow.

Within FSA takes the deviation of each FSA from its mean. The statistics for average donations and fraction of households
who donate are computed using all data between 1991 and 2006. The distribution of the visible minority Fragmentation

Appendix B: Method for Regrouping FSA Boundaries
Our analysis uses the Forward Sortation Area (FSA) to approximate an individual’s community
or local neighborhood. We chose this area partly because data is readily available for this level of
aggregation, and partly because with an average of 7000 people inside its boundaries, it is a reasonable
proxy for the group of people with whom an individual interacts regularly.
The boundaries of each FSA are drawn by Canada Post to accommodate mail delivery, and over
time they are occasionally redrawn as the local populations change. This occurs mostly as parts of
rural areas grow large enough to require their own FSA, at which point Canada Post will reconfigure
the boundaries. While less common, an urban FSA can become large enough to split into two urban
FSAs, or shrink enough to be absorbed into an existing FSA.
Changes in FSA boundaries pose a problem for our analysis mainly because they might lead to
“false” population or demographic changes. For example, suppose that within an FSA all of the visible
minorities live in a rapidly expanding sub-area of the FSA. Suppose also that this sub-area grows large
enough over time to become its own FSA. Upon separation, it will seem as though the original FSA
becomes completely homogeneous (i.e. it loses all of its visible minorities), even though no individuals
have left the original boundaries of that area and the demographics may not have changed by much.
Unchecked, these boundary changes might cause spurious results in our regression models – especially
our preferred specification, which uses FSA fixed effects.
We solve this problem using the method described below. We refer to new FSAs that appear
over time as “emerging” FSAs, and FSAs that disappear as “retiring” FSAs. Our solution to the
problem of changing boundaries is to combine each emerging FSA with the FSA it emerged from, and
each retiring FSA with the FSA it retires into. The FSAs we use to combine with the emerging and
retiring FSAs are identified by hand using various methods, such as: GIS software to overlay FSA
41

boundary maps from different years; Google Maps to identify other FSAs in close proximity;
coordinates of the centroid of each FSA to determine the proximity between any pair of FSAs.17 We
only recombine emerging and retiring FSAs from 1996 forward, because we do not have FSA
boundary maps or data on rural FSAs for 1991. Before applying our sample exclusions, in our tax data
we identified 119 emerging FSAs and 4 retiring FSAs between 1991 and 1996. After applying our
sample exclusions, we are left with 84 emerging FSAs and no retiring FSAs. We drop these 84 FSAs
from the data for years 1991 to 1995, and do not use them for religion regressions in 1996. Note that
this has no impact on the Visible Minority analysis because it uses only data from 1996 forward. We
suspect that this would have a minimal impact on the Religion regressions also, because most emerging
FSAs tend to come from rural areas, which would be dropped from the analysis anyway.18
In our tax data, we have identified 159 emerging FSAs between 1996 and 2006, and 5 retiring
FSAs. 19 Of the emerging FSAs, 142 are linked back to a rural area, and are not considered as part of
our sample universe because we do not analyze rural FSAs. We therefore have to worry only about 17
emerging FSAs and 5 retiring FSAs. After applying our sample restrictions, we have only 5 remaining
emerging FSAs and no retiring FSAs. These emerging FSAs are combined with the urban FSA from
which it emerged. As noted in the main text, there are 17,108 FSA-year observations prior to the
recombining emerging FSAs into their old boundaries, and 17,071 observations after.

17

We created a file that links an FSA to its group based on this hand-checking procedure, which is available upon request.
Recall that because we have no data on rural FSAs in 1991, we are unable to map these emerging FSAs back into the
rural locations.
19
Our sample excludes all rural FSAs and those that have missing census data in at least one year, missing tax data in at
least one year, or do not link to the census at in at least one year.
