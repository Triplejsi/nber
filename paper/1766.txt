Changes

ABSTR
Among the interesting changes in the U.S. economy in recent years
have been the substantial changes in the age distribution of income and
its components. These changes are interesting in and of themselves, but
also are an important background against which to interpret aggregate
economic statistics.
In this paper we present detailed data on both the shares of
income, and the relative income per household, of households headed by
persons of different ages. These data are supplemented by analogous
data for the various components of income: earnings, property income,
Social Security, unemployment insurance, welfare, and pensions. These
data are tabulated from 17 years of the annual Current Population
Surveys (CPS).
Among the most interesting trends are the dramatic increase in the
share of income received by households over the age of 65 and also in
their relative incomes; the enormous growth in the absolute and relative
contribution of Social Security income to the incomes of households 5564, and 65 and over; the sharp decrease in the share of total earnings
and of the relative earnings of these two most elderly cohorts; and
swings in the shares of total income of the other age cohorts which
reflect in part changes in the numbers of persons in households of
different ages, e.g., due to the aging of the baby-boom generation.

Introduction

Among the important changes in the U.S. economy in the last twenty
years have been the dramatic shifts in the age distribution of income

and its components. There are undoubtedly many reasons for these
shifts, although the large increases in real Social Security benefits in
the early l970s and the continuing trend toward early retirement and

disability probably play a prominent role. In addition, substantial
changes in the age/sex/experience/occupational mix of the labor force

and changes in the nature of household composition are undoubtedly

important. As an input to other research1 we have compiled
substantial time series data from 17 years of current population

surveys. Many commentors on this other research have indicated to us
that it might be extremely valuable if we provided these data for use by

other researchers. The purpose of this paper is to present both an
overview of the broad trends and changes in the age distribution of
income in the United States from 1968 to 1984, and to provide the
detailed data for such possible use.

Changes in the age distribution of income are important for a

variety of reasons. Pronounced changes affect our ability to interpret
conventional aggregate statistics, such as consumption or saving rates.

They can be of potential use in testing alternative economic theories,
e.g., those concerning saving behavior.2 Of course, they are

Test of the Neutrality Hypothesis," Carnegie-Rochester Conference
Series, Summer 1985.
2. See Boskin and Kotlikoff, op-cit.

interesting in and of themselves in documenting important trends and
developments in the economy.

Such data have not been available previously for a number of

reasons. Most of our concern with time series on income and its
components has focused on aggregates or on disaggregation by income

group rather than age. Fortunately, the March Supplement to the Current
Population Survey (CPS) provides detailed information on income and its

components disaggregated in a number of ways, including by age of head

of household.3 We have merged the 1968 through 1984 CPS tapes in
order to produce the data on the age distribution of income and relative
incomes per household of different age cohorts.

In Section 2 we discuss the general patterns which emerge in

examining the age distribution of total income. We also discuss some of
the interesting features revealed in the time series on the age
distribution of the components of income, such as earnings, property

income, Social Security, etc. We also mention several caveats on using
the data, such as the likelihood of systematic underreporting of
property income and some inconsistencies in the classification of income

3. The term "household" as used in this manuscript deserves elaboration.
The disaggregation we sought for our research was the proverbial
"economic decision-making unit." In practice, that is not always a
household, nor is it always a family. Obviously we consider any
dwelling occupied by immediate family members only as a household. If
two or more families occupy the same dwelling, they are each counted as
a separate household. Finally, any unrelated individuals occupying the
same housing unit are counted as separate households. Henceforth, we
shall refer to all economic decision-making units delineated as
indicated above as a "household."

This section also contains charts presenting the time series
changes in the age distribution of income and its components and
comparisons among age cohorts, of relative household incomes.

In Section 3, we present more detail concerning the adjustments we
made to the CPS data and possible issues which may arise when using the
data.

We also present full time series data for total income and each of
the components of income in an Appendix for those who will find them of
use in their own research.

2. Major Trends in the Age Distribution of Income and Its Components
Figures 1 and 2 present a visual summary of the major trends in the
share of total income received by households headed by persons of
different age groups and in the ratio of income per household of
different age groups to the 35-44 year old group's average income per

household. The full data on total income shares and group income per
household relative to the 35-44 income per household, together with
various other aggregate statistics are presented in the Appendix in

Table 1. In addition to the share of income and the relative income,
the data on income per household and the number of households are also
of substantial interest in the discussion which follows.
The age distribution of total income has changed substantially over

the period 1968-1984. The share of total income received by households
headed by those 65 and over increased over 30%, while the share

accounted for by those 45-54, for example, declined substantially. The
other major change from the beginning to the end of the period was the

substantial increase in the share of total income received by households

with heads age 25-34. These total income share statistics must be read
in combination with those on the number of households.

For example,

from 1968 to 1984 the total number of households increased by about 47%.

The number of households increased more than proportionally for the 1524 year old age group and the 65 and over group, and less than
proportionally for the 35-44 year old, the 55-64 year old and the 45-54

year old groups. Most pronounced was the 25-34 year age group, whose
number of households doubled.

The shares of total income received over the period suggest a
substantial shift, therefore, from the mature households in the 45-54
year age category to the baby-boomers, age 25-34 in this period, and the
elderly, those over 65.

A different pattern emerges, however, when we look at the relative
incomes per household for the different age categories in Figure 2.

Clearly, some of the shift in total income to the elderly and young
adults occurred for purely demographic reasons reflecting the number of

households. The 25-34 year old group, for example, had about a 20%
increase in its share of total income, but when we examine the income
per household, we find that income per household declined by about 12%

relative to the 35-44 year old group's income per household. Most of
the trends in income per household relative to the 35-44 year old group
are monotonic over the period, whereas the total income shares often
peak or trough in the mid-1970s, reflecting the movement of the babyboom generation from age group to age group.

Also of substantial interest in Figure 2 are the substantial gains
in income per household relative to the 35-44 year old group made by 45-

6

54 year olds, 55-64 year olds, and those 65 and over. From the
beginning to the end of the period, the gains amounted to approximately

7%, 10%, and 25%, respectively. Correspondingly, the 15-24 year old and
25-34 year old groups experienced relative declines of 27% and 13%,
respectively.

We present the full data in Table 1.

It should be emphasized that

no control is made for the typical size of household or the average
number of workers per household, which may well

vary not only across

different age groups but also through time.
Figures 3 - 8 convey a pictorial summary of the data contained in
Tables 2 - 7 in the Appendix. These data disaggregate the components of

income and examine the shares of the total for each component, and the
groups average per household relative to the 35-44 year old groups
average per household, for each component of income.

Among the many interesting features of these figures and tables, we
point out the following:
1.

For both those over age 65 and those 55-64, the group's

relative earnings moved opposite to their relative incomes. Both groups
had major gains in their incomes per household relative to the 35-44
year olds, but their earnings relative to this group dropped

substantially. For the 65 and over group, this undoubtedly reflects the
continued decline in labor force participation which apparently
accelerated in the early part of this period.4
For the 55-64 year olds, it may also reflect declining labor force

in the Early l970s," Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1984.

participation, the increased trend to accepting Social Security benefits

at age 62 rather than at age 65, and the growth in disability. While
the 55-64 year olds had about the same share of total income in 1984 as

in 1968, their share of total earnings declined almost 10%. While the
65 and over group had an increase in their share of total income of over
30%, their share of total earnings, which was already small in 1968,

fell

still further.

For all other groups, the movements in earnings were very similar
to movements in total income, since earnings tend to dominate total

income for these groups. Data analogous to those for total income in
Table 1 are presented for earnings in Table 2 in the Appendix.
2.

We turn next to the data on property income given in Table 3

in the Appendix and note that the share of all property income increased
substantially for the 25-34 year olds for a large part of the period,

but began to decline somewhat around 1981. Undoubtedly, this partly
reflects the passage of the baby-boom generation into the next age

cohort. The share of property income for 35-44 year olds and 55-64 year
olds varies somewhat over the period, but for each the share at the end

of the period is very close to the share at the beginning. The most
pronounced movements are the decline in the share of property income of
45-54 year olds and the substantial increase in the share of property

income of those 65 and over. The increase for the latter group was
about 12%, while the decline for the former was about 30%. Again, these
shares of all property income reflect the differential growth in the
number of households in these age groups mentioned above and presented

in Table 1. The age-group-specific property income per household
relative to the 35-44 year olds' property income per household exhibits

substantial variation and often no monotonic trend. This may partly
reflect systematic underreporting of property income in the CPS and

other household surveys. This component is probably the least reliable
of any of the components.
3.

When we look at Social Security income, which includes

survivors' benefits, disability payments, and (after 1976) Supplemental
Security Income (SSI), not surprisingly we see that the overwhelming

bulk of this income accrues to those in the 65 and over group. Still,
their share of all Social Security income, a component which grew much

more rapidly than income in general, grew throughout this period. Part
of this is due to the slightly larger increase in the number of
households as well as various features of the Social Security system.
The average nominal Social Security income per household increased sixfold over this period, while the price level increased 270%
The share of all Social Security income received by households in
the 55-64 age group also increased substantially, ranging from about 12%
in the 1968-72 period to close to 16% in its peak in 1978, and declining

thereafter to 14-15%. The Social Security income per household in this

group grew by 750% in nominal terms over this period. Examining just
the Social Security income per household undoubtedly can be misleading.
Most of these households received no Social Security income, whereas a
modest fraction received very substantial Social Security benefit

payments, i.e., those who were disabled or those, especially in the age
62-64 group, who had retired.

While there are some modest changes in

the shares of total Social Security payments for the other age groups,
the total amounts are very small relative to those of the two oldest age

groups. Perhaps the most noticeable is the fall in the share of all

19

Social Security income from about 8% to 4% for those in the age 45-54
year old group, reflecting in part the relative decline in the share of
total households represented by this age group.

Prior to 1976, a variety of old age benefits were included in
welfare income which were subsequently included in Social Security

income. Therefore, as detailed in Table 5, the share of welfare income
received by those 65 and over was 30% in 1968, but only 4% in 1984, the
fall primarily due to the fact that substantial benefit payments were

reclassified as Social Security. Thus, the welfare statistics must be
interpreted with this proviso in mind. Even with this correction, it is
still clear that the young age groups experienced substantial real
increases in welfare income per household.

Data on age specific income and relative income from unemployment
insurance by year from 1968-1984 are presented in Table 6 in the
Appendix as well as graphically presented in Figures 3 - 8.

Since the

amount of unemployment insurance reflects not only a secular increase in
the generosity of unemployment insurance, but cyclical factors in the
economy (witness the substantial increase in unemployment benefits in
the 1975 recession, for example), we choose not to elaborate on this

specific component. Undoubtedly, it would be interesting to merge these
data with age-specific unemployment rates by year, but that is beyond

the scope of this paper. It should be noted that for some purposes,
researchers might wish to aggregate unemployment insurance with welfare
and/or Social Security income.

Table 7 in the Appendix elaborates the information contained in
Figures 3 - 8 on age specific shares of pension income and relative

pension income. Not surprisingly, pension income has risen

20

substantially in all but the youngest age groups. The overwhelming bulk
of pension income, obviously, is received by those 55 and over. Indeed,
in 1984, over half of total reported pension income was received by

those over the age of 65. This age group's total pension income of $40

billion was almost 15 times its nominal pension income in 1968. For
the 55-64 year old group, the aggregate was $25.7 billion, in 1984, a
25-fold nominal increase over the period.

For 1968-75, the changes in

the data are very modest and are also obscured by the inclusion of net

royalties, alimony, and other regular contributions. After 1975, the
pension income series is much closer to what one might expect of the
typical definition, including only private and government pensions and

annuities. This changed nature of the recording of the component is
partly responsible for the decline in the (albeit very modest) pension
income of the two youngest age groups in this period.

Pension income may also be systematically understated as is

property income. Unfortunately, the proclivity to underreport pension
income is not as well-studied as the proclivity to underreport other

types of property income. Obviously, for different types of analyses,
researchers may wish to combine the pension income data with those on
property income, and in other cases, with those on Social Security.

We have followed certain major trends in the age distribution of
income and its components in the period 1968-84 in the United States.

Substantial changes, some monotonic and others not, occurred in this

period, both in the individual components and in the aggregate. These
reflect, obviously, demographic trends, economic events (such as high
interest rates in recent years), and the changing impact of various

fiscal programs (e.g., Social Security). Changes in the typical size of

21

households and the average number of workers per household have much to

do with the changes noted. We have deliberately avoided trying to
decompose these changes by their potential causes, not because this is

not a worthwhile subject of inquiry, but because our purpose is to
present broad trends and make the data available to the research
community. Perhaps these data will be useful as an input into generating
research precisely on these questions.

3. Technical Issues
In addition to the discontinuities associated with many of the

series on income components discussed in Section 2, other problems with
the CPS March Supplement tapes are likely to be of interest to those
considering use of this data set.

The first issue confronting a researcher using the CPS data is

selection of the type of record from which to gather information. For
purposes of testing economic theories, one must have data decomposed

into the relevant decision-making unit. The relevant unit in most cases
is the family. Although the CPS data file contains a record for each
family, there are two drawbacks to using family records directly.

First, prior to 1976 the family records do not offer a detailed

breakdown of income by source. Furthermore, the family record
aggregates the income information of primary families and subfamilies
when the two inhabit the same dwelling (a subfamily is a family with

members related to the primary family in the household). To the extent

5. The precise nature of these discontinuities is noted after the
respective tables in the Appendix.

22

economic decisions are made independently by primary families and
subfamilies, this aggregation is undesirable.

By using income information found on person records in the data

file, one can circumvent these problems. Person records provide a
detailed breakdown of income sources throughout the sample and also

permit separation of primary family and subfamily data. Unfortunately,
there is another problem that is unavoidable, regardless of the record-.
type chosen.

This second problem stems from the truncation of income amounts in

reporting. If income exceeds a designated ceiling in some category, the
ceiling value is reported rather than the actual amount of income

received. The nominal value of the ceilings changes over the sample
period. In the interest of partial consistency, we chose to truncate

each income source at the same real amount throughout the sample. A
base year was selected for each category in which the given nominal
ceiling represented the minimum ceiling in real terms for the entire

sample period. Nominal ceiling levels in all other years were then
calculated by applying the implicit personal consumption expenditure
deflator to the real value of the ceiling.

Once the nominal ceilings have been determined for each category

and each year, the procedure is one of simple truncation. If the
reported value exceeds the nominal ceiling, only the ceiling value is
added as we aggregate income totals by source across the various

cohorts. This truncation obviously biases the dispersion of income
downward, but our procedure of truncating at equivalent values in real

terms may make our measures more consistent over the sample. It is
certainly conceivable that one could get a more accurate measure by

23

employing more sophisticated statistical techniques to estimate the

upper tail of the distribution for each category and each cohort. Our
procedure is admittedly simple, but served our purpose. Truncation is
likely to cause more distortion in some components of income, such as
earnings and property income for which the ceiling amounts were more
likely to be binding.

Despite these caveats, the CPS March Supplement remains a
potentially valuable source of data for researchers interested in income

information decomposed by source, age group, race, etc. Table 1
presents data on the age distribution of total income. Tables 2-7
present data on the age distribution of the components of income:

earnings, property income, social security, welfare, unemployment

insurance, and pensions. We hope other researchers find these data
useful for their own research.

This category includes income from unemployment insurance, veterans payments, and
1.
workman's compensation throughout the sample. From 1968-1975 government employee pensions
are also included. Consequently, there is a drastic reduction in the share of this income
going to households headed by individuals 65 and over after 1975.

Pension income as defined in the CPS
includes private pensions, annuities, net
royalties, alimony, and other regular contributions
from 1968-1975. After 1975, pension

income consists of only private and
qovernrnent pensions and annuities. Hence, there is severe
discontinuity in these statistics.
