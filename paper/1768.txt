The Deductibility of State and Local Taxes:
LTpact Effects by State and Incon Class

ABSTRACT

This paper provides careful estimates of the impact of
removing the deductibility of state and local taxes by state and

by income class. We show how deductibility affects marginal and
average tax rates for both state and federal tax systems. One
striking result is that combined federal income tax and state tax

burdens would generally fall under the President's tax reform
proposal, even for high income people in high tax states.

I. Introduction
President Reagan's tax reform proposal calls for the elimination of
the

deductibility

of state and local taxes. The President and his spokesmen

have stated that this is one part of the proposal that is not negotiable.

Presumably, this is because the increased revenue from eliminating state and
local tax deductibility--about $33 billion according to the President's proposal1——is needed to finance tax reductions contained in other portions of

the proposal. Critics of the President have argued that elimination of deduct"
ibility would put an unfair burden on residents of high tax states; and would
have a disastrous impact on state and local public finance.
Who would be most hurt if this part of the President's proposal were

adopted? The purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of the
impact of removing the deductibility of state and local taxes

by state and by income class. We show how deductibility affects marginal and
average tax rates for both state and federal tax systems. We provide
relatively detailed information on the impact upon state tax structures.

Due to lack of appropriate data, we cannot consider property taxes in
comparable detail.2
Obviously, the potential impact of removing state and local tax deduct-

ibility depends upon what the rest of the tax code looks like. At this point, no
one knows exactly what will emerge from the legislative process. We examine the
impact of deductibility both under the status quo and under the President's

proposal.

These results should be of some use in assessing the implications

of any "in—between" proposals that are presented.

Section II describes our data and methods. Section III shows how
marginal and average tax rates for state and federal tax systems are affected by

the deductibility of state taxes. One striking result is that combined federal
income tax and state tax burdens would generally fall under the President's proposal,

even for high income individuals in high tax states. A concluding section offers
some brief comments on the political debate surrounding the deductibility of
state taxes.

II. Data and Methods

The basic data source for this study is a stratified random sample of
88,000 Federal Income Tax returns for the year 1982.

(The computer file with

these data is documented by Strudler lundated]). Most returns include the tax-

payer's state.3 However, tax returns with Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) over
$200,000 do not include a state identifier and are therefore excluded. Nor
does our sample include individuals who file state tax returns but not federal
returns; this group probably comprises mostly older persons expecting property tax rebates.

We
rules

have programmed the major individual income and general

sales tax

(which together comprise about 60 percent of states' revenues from their

own sources)

for every state for the year l982. With

this information, we can

estimate each taxpaying unit's state individual income and general sales tax

liabilities under any given set of rules. For purposes of simplicity, instead
of reporting results for the income and general sales tax separately, we view
them as two components of a single structure.

Thus, for example, "the"

marginal tax rate is the increment to the sum of income and sales taxes as-

sociated with a dollar increase in income0 Unless otherwise noted, then,
when we refer to state "tax structure," we mean the combined individual income—
sales tax structure.

some cases the return address on a
tax form may be that of a 1

Our tax simulation model allows us to compute any desired summary

measure of each state's tax structure under alternative tax regimes. As is
well known, for complicated non—proportional tax systems, generally there is

no single number that can characterize the entire system. Our focus is on
marginal and average rates (with respect to Adjusted Gross Income) faced by

members of different income groups. To be more concrete, we adopt the following notation:

TrTf = state and federal tax liabilities, respectively.

ttf = state

and federal gross marginal tax rates, respectively.

These are obtained by finding the incremental tax liability associ—
ated with a one dollar increase in taxable wage income, and not
taking into account the fact that states taxes can (sometimes) be
deducted on federal income tax returns, and federal taxes can (sometimes) be deducted on state income tax returns.
= 1 if the taxpayer itemizes on the Federal income tax return, and
takes the value zero otherwise.

I =

1 if the taxpayer can deduct federal taxes on the state return,

and takes the value zero otherwise.
Y =

adjusted

gross income.

In general, an individual's state and federal tax liabilities are non-

linear functions of income. Hence, we can write

(1) T

f

(2) T =

fs f
g(Y—ITf—a)

represents reductions in txabie incone (other than state income and

taxes

but including local taxes) that are allowed in the computation of

federal income taxes, and a is defined analogously.
In reality deductions of tax payment are always done on a cash rather

than liability basis. This avoids burdening the taxpayer with solving a system
of nonlinear equations, but requires knowing the cash payments, which are not

—4—

available to us. Therefore we approximate the cash payment with the calculated
liability. In a steady state these should be identical, but the difference
might be significant during the transition to a broad-based tax.
It is interesting to note the considerable differences among states with

respect to the deductibility of federal taxes. Eight states (Alabama, Arizona,
Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, and Utah) allow a full de-

duction for Federal income taxes on the state return. Montana allows only
itemizers to deduct federal taxes; it is the only state to distinguish between

itemizers and non—itemizers in this way. Four states set a maximum for the deduction: Delaware allows up to $300 (single) or $600 (joint), Oregon up to $7000,
South Carolina up to $500, and Kansas up to $5000 (single) or $10,000 (joint).

For taxpayers whose federal tax payments exceed the ceiling, Kansas also allows

one half of the difference as a deduction. Iowa allows its non—itemizers to de—
deduct 85% of their federal taxes. North Dakota and Oklahoma have optional tax
tables (with higher rates) that allow a deduction for federal taxes. Four states
(Arizona, Hawaii, Oklahoma and Mississippi) allow a deduction for their own

state income tax payments, this is also treated as if liabilities were deductible
and therefore lowers t

S

Consider now a one dollar decrease (in absolute value) of a, i.e., a
change in the state tax law that increases state taxable income by one dollar.

We define the state net marginal tax rate, T, as the sum of the associated
changes in state and federal tax liability,5 That is, it is the total increase
in tax liability, taking into account the fact that changes in the state tax
law have an impact

upon federal tax liability.
the notation developed above,

5Another possible conceptual experiment is to compute the increase in tax
liability associated with a one dollar increase in income, which would have
first order effects on both federal and state tax liabilities. As this seems
less interesting for policy purposes, we do not consider it here.

The interpretation of equation (6) is straightforward. For individuals
who do not itemize deductions on their federal returns (If =

0),

the state marginal

tax rate is determined entirely by the slope of state tax structure, gt• For
individuals who itemize on their federal returns (If =

1),

the incremental tax

burden is reduced by the federal marginal tax rate, f ', times the increase in

states taxes, g'. Hence the presence of (1_f*If) in the numerator. However,
for individuals who also can deduct federal taxes on their state tax returns,
the fact that federal tax liability has gone down creates a second order increase in state tax liability.6 This accounts for the presence of the term
(1—I I g!f') in the denominator.

Average tax rates under various tax regimes are also of interest; these

are defined in the obvious way as T/Y and Tf/Y for state and federal tax
structures, respectively.

Before proceeding to our results, several limitations to our methodology
should be noted:
(a)

if

We do not allow for any behavioral response to tax code changes. Presumably,

deductibility were removed, states and

localities would modify their spending

and taxing decisions (See Inman [1985] and Noto and Zimmerman [1984].) Since
we ignore these effects, our results are best viewed as estimates of the initial

impact. Our reason for neglecting behavioral responses is not that we think that
thv are unimportant, but rather that •etimatinr-y them

in

a reliable way would

carry us too far afield.

•(b) Closely related

only

to point (a) is the fact that our results tell us

about the statutory incidence of the various tax systems. Standard theo-

retical considerations suggest that economic incidence may be quite different.

Having made this observation, we hasten to add that any serious study of the
economic incidence of state and lodal' tax, deductibility must begin with care-

ful analysis of its statutory impact.

(c) Our income variable is annual Adjusted Gross Income. For many
problems, some indicator of permanent income is more appropriate.
(ci)

Our simulations are not revenue neutral. That is, when revenues

are gained due to the removal of deductibility, we do not lower taxes elsewhere

in the system in order to keep revenues constant. In the current political
environment, it is impossible to predict with any confidence whether Congress

—7—

would lower marginal tax rates, increase exemptions, or what. Indeed
adjustments might take place entirely outside of the income tax system
in the form of changes in business taxes, or perhaps reductions in the deficit.
In the face of such uncertainty, it seemed that our results would be most
compelling if we simply refrained from hazarding a guess.

III. Results
As noted above, the potential impact of removing state and local tax deduct—

ibility depends upon what the rest o the tax code looks like. We begin by examining
the impact of deductibility under the status quo, i.e., the tax law as it

existed in 1982. We then go on to study the impact of deductibility under the
President's proposal. The President's proposal, which incorporates many
modifications to the existing tax code, is described in detail in the
President's Tax Proposals to the Congress for Fairness, Growth, and Simplicity [1985]., For the most part, we were able to simulate the President's

proposal using information available in the 1982 data. However, in some cases
the President's proposal adds new elements to the tax base, e.g., certain

fringe benefits and more social security receipts. In such cases, it was
necessary to make some imputations; these are described in Lindsey [l986].
The overall results for each state are summarized in Table 1; the last

line in the table shows averages for each of the columns. Columns (1)
through (10) refer to the status quo, i.e., the federal and state tax laws

as they stood in 1982. Column (1) shows t, the gross state marginal tax
rate; column (2) shows tf the gross federal income tax rate. Columns (3)
and (4) convey information on the extent of deductibility; column (3) shows
the percentage of state individual income tax returns on which federal income
taxes are fully deductible on the margin;8 column (4) shows the percentage of

for simulating the President's tax plan.

federal

tax returns on which state tax liability is deductible. Net state

marginal tax rates CT) and net federal income tax rates (Tf)

are

in columns

(5) and (6), respectively. Average tax rates for the state and federal systems
with deductibility are in columns (7) amd (8), respectively; the corresponding

average rates without deductibility are in columns (9) and (10). As noted
earlier, local tax deductibility is taken into account in the computation of
federal tax liabilities.9

Columns (11) through (15) pertain to the President's proposal20
Specifically, we analyze the President's proposal as it would have applied to

the year 1982. Column (11) shows gross marginal federal income tax rates.
Column (12) shows the percentage of state individual income tax returns on
which federal taxes are fully deductible on the margin. Column (13) shows the

net marginal federal income tax rate. Column (14) shows federal average tax

rates. Columns (15) and (16) show state and federal average tax rates if state
deductibility is allowed, but the Presidentts proposal is otherwise unaltered.
The following are the main results that emerge-from Table 1:

(a) From columns (1) and (5), we see that on average, under

the

status quo

there is only one—half of a percentage point difference between gross and net
state marginal tax rates.

(b) Similarly, from columns (7) and (9), the burden of state personnel
income and general sales taxes expressed as a propor±iôn of income is not
massively affected by deductibility——the mean difference between average

91n our data set, local tax payments are subject to an unusual form of
rounding called "blurring." (See Strudler [undated] for details.) We judge
this to be an insignificant source of error.

to column (4)——it is just a vector of zeros.
money values are deflated by the change in the consumer price index for
urban wage earners between March 1, 1981 and March 1, 1985. Because the Presi—
dent's proposal is completely indexed, this is an attractive method of using
our 1982 data set.

tax rates with and without deductibility is about 0.1 percentage points0 Note
that in effect, the figures in column (9) would be the (gross and net) state
average tax rates under the President's proposal.

(c) From columns (2) and (6), the ability to deduct federal taxes on
state returns does not have much of an impact on federal marginal tax rates——
the average difference between gross and net is only 0.1 percentage points.

(d) From columns (8) and (10), the average decrease in federal average
tax rates due to the deductibility of state personal income and general sales
taxes and local taxes is only 1.3 percentage points.

(e) The small changes in means noted in items (a)through (d) above

iask considerable differences across states. For example, while the mean
difference between gross and net state marginal tax rates is 0.5 percentage
points, for Minnesota and New York the corresponding figures are 1.4 and 1.9

percentage points, respectively. Similarly, while the national decrease in
federal average tax rates due to deductibility is 1.3 percentage points, for
Minnesota it is 2.1 percentage points, and for New York it is 2.6 percentage

points. Having pointed out that differences do exist between states, we
are left with the question of whether they are large enough to account for
the enormous interstate differences in states' political reactions to deductibility. We return to this question later.

(f) From columns (2) and (11), under the President's proposal gross
federal marginal tax rates fall substantially for every state; so do net
federal marginal tax rates (from columns (6) and (13)); and the mean difference

between net and gross federal marginal tax rates is still small. From
columns (8) and (14), federal average tax rates also fall. None of this is
too surprising given that lowering individual income tax rates is the center-

piece of the President's proposal. Still, it is worth noting that even in
high tax states, the effect of removing the deductibility of state and local taxes is
overwhelmed by the reduction in federal tax rates, at least on average.

—10—

(g) The last two columns are present to give a sense of what would
happen if deductibility of state and local taxes were restored, but the rest of the

President's proposal were intact. (Implicitly, we assume that the lost revenues
would be raised outside the individual income tax system.) The main lesson here
is that even if deductibility were reinstated under the President's plan, its
(incremental) impact would be relatively small because of the relatively low

marginal tax rates that characterize the plan. From columns (14) and (16),
if deductibility were restored under the President's Proposal, the mean federal
average tax rate would fall by only 0.7 percentage points; under the status quo,

the mean difference (from comparing columns (8) and (10)) is 1.3 percentage
points.

Results by Income Class. We next consider the differential impact of
deductibility by income class. Table 2 shows results for households with AGI
under $10,000; Table 3, AGI between $10,000 and $20,000; Table 4, AGI between
$20,000 and $40,000; and Table 5, AGI in excess of $40,000.12 Examination
of these tables yields the following observations:

(a) Comparing the column (1) results for the various income groups,
we see that on average, state tax systems are characterized by increasing gross

marginal tax rates, and thus can be considered "progressive." But when state
net marginal tax rates (from column (5).) are considered, the following striking

result occurs: not only do state net marginal tax rates increase more slowly
with income than do their gross counterparts, but the net marginal tax rate
for the over $40,000 income class is less than that for the $20—40,000 income

class. Thus, the increasing incidence of itemization at high income levels
plus increasing federal marginal tax rates "overcomes" the higher state statu-

tory rates. However, it may be inappropriate to think about proqressivitv
12We do not display separately summaries of the few returns with negative adjusted gross income, although these are included in Table 1. Also, recall from
Section II above that returns with AGI in excess of $200,000 are omitted from
consideration.

—11.

only for one component of the tax system as a whole; columns (5) and (6) of the
various tables make it clear that the state and federal marginal tax rates
combined increase throughout the income scale.

(b) For the groups represented in Tables 2 and 3, i.e., the low income
groups, the issue of deductibility is not very important simply because the
proportion of itemized federal tax returns is so low.

(See column (4) in

each Table.) In these two groups, state gross and net tax rates, both marginal
and average, are very close to each other, and the same is true for federal
tax liabilities.
(c)

In the upper income groups (Tables 4 and 5), a high incidence of

itemization together with high marginal tax rates leads to sharp divergence

between net and gross marginal state tax rates under the status quo. For
example, from columns (1) and (5) of Table 5, itemization for households

with AGI in excess of $40,000 cuts state marginal tax rates by a third, from

6.6 percent to 4.4 percent. For the same group, removing deductibility under
the status quo would increase average federal tax rates by 2.7 percentage

points, from 20.5 percent to 23.2 percent (see columns (8) and (10).) Again,

though, there are considerable differences across states. In Table 5, New York
is the most dramatic example——deductibility lowers state marginal tax rates
from 18.8 percent to 11.3 percent, and lowers average federal tax rates from
25.0 percent to 20.1 percent.

Cd) In our discussion of Table 1 we noted that when all income groups
are considered together, under the President's proposal the impact of removing
deductibility of state and local taxes is overwhelmed by the reduction in federal tax
rates, even in high tax states.'3 Table 5 indicates that this statement holds

even for the very highest income group. From columns (9) and (14), we see
that for those with AGI in excess of $40,000, under the President's Proposal
the average tax rate for state and federal income taxes taken together is 22.2
130f course, there are other aspects of the President's proposal, such as higher
exemptions, that also contribute to lower average tax rates.

—12--

percent (=

5.4 + 16.8).

Under the status quo, the overall average tax rate

is higher, 25.7 percent. (Add together columns (7) and (8).) As a proportion
of income, then, the state and federal tax liabilities of high income people
fall under the President's proposal.

This result, of course, is for the average high income household. What
about those who reside in high tax states? Calculations analagous to those
presented in the preceding paragraph indicate that for high income New Yorkers,
overall average tax rates fall from 31.5 percent to 29.1 percent under the

President's Proposal; for Minnesota the President's proposal induces a slight

rise, frøm 28.3 percent to 28.8 percent. In short, just like their middle
income and low income counterparts, on average high income people come out ahead
when they trade deductibility of state and ldcal taxes in exchange for lower federal

marginal income tax rates. And even in states where one would expect high income
to be very adversely affected, they either come out ahead like everybody else, or
suffer very small increases in their overall average tax burdens.
IV.

Concluding Remarks
We have shown how effective state sales and income tax rates are affected

by the federal income tax system and vice versa. The analysis has been conducted in the contexts of both the status quo and the President's proposal. In
our discussion of the method for doing the calculations, we were careful to stress

its limitations. At this juncture we would like to note again one of these
limitations——the

calculations are "static" in the sense that they do not take

into account possible behavioral reactions by governments and households.

The

reason for emphasizing this point is because we think it helps explain a puzzle
raised by our calculations. Namely, we have shown that the trade of state and
local

deductibility in return for lower federal tax

rates

(in conjunction

with other provisions of the President's proposal) is a good

deal

for all

income groups in virtually all states. If that is true, why is the idea so con—

—13—

troversial? Two possible explanations hinge on beliefs that people might
have regarding behavorial responses to the proposal:

(a) People may not believe that federal marginal tax rates will stay

at the levels in the President's proposal. A federal income tax base including
state and local taxes may ultimately lead to higher tax burdens than are possible

under the status quo. Thus, the lower average tax rates reported in our tables
might be perceived as only temporary.

(b) The opposition to the removal of deductibility may be coming not
from "ordinary" citizens, but from those who have a special interest in the

existence of large state and local public sectors——elected officials, civil

servants, public sector union leaders, et al. For example, to those connected
with state government the key columns in the tables are (1) and (5), which show
how federal deductibility changes the tax price of state provided goods and

services. Our figures indicate that for high income people, the change would
on average be an increase of 33%, and in a state like New York, it would be

almost double that. No one knows exactly how such an increase in tax prices
would change voter behavior. Perhaps those who are against the proposal
anticipate substantial pressure to lower state expenditures.
