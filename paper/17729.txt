Who Shrunk China? Puzzles in the Measurement of Real GDP

NBER Working Paper No. 17729
January 2012
JEL No. E01
ABSTRACT
The latest World Bank estimates of real GDP per capita for China are significantly lower than previous
ones. We review possible sources of this puzzle and conclude that it reflects a combination of factors,
including substitution bias in consumption, reliance on urban prices which we estimate are higher
than rural ones, and the use of an expenditure-weighted rather than an output-weighted measure of
GDP. Taking all these together, we estimate that real per-capita GDP in China was 50% higher relative
to the U.S. in 2005 than the World Bank estimates.

1. Introduction
The International Comparison Program (ICP) is a collaborative effort of the World Bank
and other international agencies to estimate the “real GDP” of countries, i.e. the value of their
GDP when adjusted for price level differences across countries and priced in dollars. Because
market exchange rates cannot be relied upon to provide the right conversion from national
currencies to dollars, the ICP computes “purchasing power parity” (PPP) exchange rates, which
compare local prices of a basket of goods with the U.S. prices of those same goods in a
benchmark year. For China, the 2005 benchmark estimates from the World Bank show that real
GDP per-capita for China was 40% smaller in 2005 than real GDP for the same year based on
extrapolations from earlier rounds of the ICP. As Deaton and Heston (2010, p. 3) report:
…the 2007 version of the World Development Indicators (WDI), World Bank (2007),
lists 2005 per capita GDP for China as $6,757 and for India as $3,452, both in current
international dollars. The 2008 version, World Bank (2008a), which includes the new
[2005] ICP data, gives, for the same year, and the same concept $4,088 for China and
$2,222 for India. For comparison, GDP per capita at market exchange rates is $1,721 for
China and $797 for India.
Maddison (2007) argues that such a downward revision for China is implausible because
extrapolating backwards it would imply per capita income below subsistence levels in early
years1. This observation raises the questions of why the downward revision occurred and
whether alternative calculations would give noticeably different results. The first of these
questions has been addressed by Heston (2007) and Deaton and Heston (2010).2 We will provide
some theoretical structure to help understand their critique, and then address the second question:

1

Using the Chinese national accounts growth rates would imply a real per capita GDP in 1970 of $400 at constant
2005 prices. The corresponding figure at the current 1970 prices is $93.
2
See also the comments by Diewert (2010a).

2
whether alternative, theoretically consistent calculations of real GDP make a difference, for
China or other countries.
Among the reasons provided by Deaton and Heston as to why the relative position of
China was lowered in the most recent ICP round are the following:
1) The price data provided by China for the most recent ICP was for urban areas, and
may have overstated the actual prices faced by rural consumers.
This first issue is a well-recognized feature of the price data provided for the 2005 ICP,
which was the first time that China participated fully in the round3. While Deaton and Heston
note that there is a theoretical issue of aggregating over large countries with diverse prices
between regions, we do not address that issue here. Rather, we treat the urban bias in the prices
reported from China to the 2005 ICP as an empirical issue to be investigated, in section 2.
2) Different index number methods imply different relative sizes of countries.
There are very substantial differences in the index numbers methods used by the World
Bank, for example, and the methods used by Penn World Table (PWT). We focus here on just
one aspect of those differences, namely, the use of fixed-weight indexes used in PWT with
flexible-weight index used by the ICP. Neary (2004) has recently proposed an alternative that
requires estimating the expenditure function across countries to obtain indexes of real
consumption. The Neary approach was further developed by Feenstra, Ma and Rao (2009) and
empirically implemented for data covering 124 countries. In section 2 we use all these methods,
along with a recommendation by Barnett, Diewert and Zellner (2009), to calculate the size of
real consumption in China. In addition to showing the differences between the various index
number approaches we use two different sets of prices for China: the prices they reported to the

3

See Asian Development Bank (2007) for more details regarding price data from China used in the 2005 ICP AsiaPacific region. It is clear that urban bias would have impacted on price data for consumption items.

3
2005 ICP, and our own estimates of alternative prices that adjust for urban versus rural
differentials. We find that the impact of adjusting China’s prices is quite large: real consumption
in China is 10 to 20% higher using our adjusted prices than using the ICP prices.4
Closely related to the index number issue but conceptually distinct is:
3) There are several different concepts of real GDP that can be measured, each of which
can imply different relative sizes of countries.
Shifting attention from just real consumption to real GDP, in section 3 we incorporate
investment, government spending, and the trade balance. We draw on estimates of real GDP
from Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011), which provides the basis for the “next generation” of
PWT. They estimate real GDPe per-capita in China for 2005 at $5,097, which is 25% larger than
the estimate from the World Bank of $4,088. If the prices of consumption goods are adjusted
based on our regression model, then real GDPe per-capita rises to $5,543, or another 10% higher.
Comparing these estimates to the World Bank’s, we conclude that the World Bank estimate is
too low by as much as 25 – 35%. In addition, real GDP in China is even higher once we
incorporate the prices of exports and imports, in section 4.
Feenstra, Heston, et al (2009) have recently contrasted real GDP measured on the
expenditure-side of the economy, as done by the World Bank and PWT, with real GDP measured
on the output-side. These two concepts differ by countries’ terms of trade, i.e. by the relative
prices of their exports and imports. We provide calculations of China’s real GDP in 2005
measured on the output-side, taking into account its terms of trade. We find that China’s real
GDP increases to $5,862 when measured in terms of its output, which exceeds expenditure-side
real GDP due to China’s low terms of trade. That measure of real GDP on the output-side is

4

These differences in real consumption do not translate into major adjustments at the GDP level as consumption is
only one component of total domestic expenditure which includes investments and government expenditure.

4
greater than the World Bank estimate of $4,088 by nearly 45%. Furthermore, we argue that if
real GDP were corrected for substitution bias using a revenue function estimated across
countries, analogous to the expenditure function approach to real consumption of Neary (2004),
then China’s real GDP could be even higher: we conclude that real GDP in China relative to the
United States is quite plausibly 50% higher than estimated by the World Bank (2008a).
Additional empirical results are in Appendix A and the proofs of propositions are in Appendix B.

2. Real Consumption
In Table 1 and the Appendix Table A1 we show various calculations of real consumption
using data for 124 countries from the 2005 International Comparisons Project (ICP).5 There are
12 categories of consumption goods that we aggregate to compute real consumption. We report
results for selected countries in Table 1, with results for all 124 countries shown in Appendix
Table A1.

2.1 Fixed and Flexible Weight Indexes
The first calculation in Table 1, column (2) is the GK (Geary, 1958, Khamis, 1970, 1972)
system, as used by the Penn World Table (PWT), but applied here to only i =1,…,M final
consumption goods, with prices pij and quantities qij across countries j = 1,…,C. The reference
prices (denoted by “e” for expenditure)  ie and the purchasing power parities PPPje are defined
as the solution to the simultaneous system:

The total number of countries in the 2005 ICP is 146, but we omitted 22 countries with missing expenditures or
prices for some consumption goods, or for other data reasons. Details are available on request.

(3)

Because real consumption for different countries is computed as in (3) using fixed
quantities qij, we refer to it as a “fixed-weight” index. It is reported in column (2) of Table 1,
relative to the United States. We see that real consumption in China is only 5.9% of that in the U.S.
in 2005. This estimate is more than twice as large as what we get from comparing nominal
consumption in U.S. dollars using official exchange rates in column (1), but is much smaller than
the figure for total real GDP per capita (including C, I, G, and X–M) relative to the U.S. of 9.8%
from the 2005 ICP (World Bank, 2008a), 6 let alone the estimate of 18.5% for real GDP per capita
that Maddison (2007, Table 5) claims is needed to avoid having Chinese living standards below
subsistence in past decades. So the conclusion is that per-capita real consumption is low for China,
relative to other countries or relative to its GDP. We now investigate whether this finding depends
on the index number method which is used to compute real consumption.
In column (3)-(5) we report various “flexible-weight” indexes, so named because they use
index formulas that are known to be exact for underlying expenditure functions.7 The first method,

6

As explained in the introduction, World Bank (2008a) which uses the 2005 ICP data gives real GDP per capita in
China of $4,088 in 2005, as compared to $41,674 in the United States. The ratio of these is 9.8%.

comparisons extend to a multilateral context when tastes are non-homothetic.

which is used by the World Bank, is the so-called EKS system,8 which starts from the Fisher
quantity indexes in each country j relative to a base country k:

j,k = 1,2,…,C.

Because this comparison between countries is not transitive in general, the EKS index takes the
geometric mean of all possible bilateral comparisons to yield a transitive multilateral index:

j,k = 1,2,…,C.

(4)

 1

The EKS estimates of real consumption are shown in column (3), from which we see that
China is 5.7% of the U.S., which is even lower than in the GK system. More generally, the GK
estimates of real consumption understate the EKS estimate for rich countries and overstate the
EKS estimates for poor countries. Specifically, when measured relative to the United States, the
GK estimates are less than the EKS estimates for most countries with higher nominal GDP per
capita than South Korea (ranked 31st out of 124 countries), and greater than the EKS estimates
for most countries with lower nominal GDP per capita than Macedonia (ranked 61st out of 124),
with a mixed pattern in-between. Those two countries are included in Table 1, and we will argue
below that the GK reference prices can be thought of as lying in-between the prices of South
Korea and the United States.
An alternative flexible-weight system is the CCD (Caves, Christensen, Diewert, 1982a,b)
index, which makes use of the Törnqvist index instead of the Fisher index. The index of real
consumption in country j relative to consumption in country k measured using the Törnqvist
index is given by:
8

Or the GEKS system, after Gini, Eltetö and Köves, and Szulc. Rather than providing the historical references to
the multilateral comparison methods we employ, we refer the reader to Balk (2008), which provides a modern
treatment of them all.

It is easy to see that these quantity indexes are not transitive unless the expenditure shares are the
same in all the countries. The CCD index is a transitive index generated from the matrix of all
binary Törnqvist indexes and is defined as:
C

(5)

 1

The CCD indexes are reported in column (4) of Table 1, and are quite close to the EKS indexes.
Generally, the three indexes of real consumption discussed so far – the GK, EKS and CCD –
give quite similar results especially for China. We conclude that the index number method cannot
account for the very low level of real consumption in China that is obtained when we use the price
collected for the 2005 ICP. But the validity of these prices themselves are open to question. It is
clear from Asian Development Bank (2007) that the price surveys in China were restricted to 11
capital cities and the rural areas surrounding these 11 cities. The ADB, following the
recommendation of an Expert Group, constructed a national average price using a method of
extrapolation also described in ADB (2007). However, the extrapolation method did not make
any explicit allowance for spatial price differences across different regions and across rural and
urban regions of China. As a result the general consensus is that national average prices have a
tendency to overstate the actual prices. Accordingly, in Appendix A we make an adjustment to
the Chinese prices by predicting them from a simple model of price levels based on data for the
other Asian countries. Of the 12 categories of consumption goods, we adjust five prices
downwards (for food and non-alcoholic beverages; clothing and footwear; education; restaurants;
and other goods and services), four prices upwards (for gross rent, fuel, power; medical and

8
health services; transport; and recreation), and leave three prices unchanged due to lack of data to
adjust them.
Real income comparisons based on the adjusted prices for China are presented at the
bottom of Table 1. In the GK calculation, real consumption in China relative to the U.S. rises
from 5.9% to 6.4%, which is a rise of 9% in Chinese real consumption. Similar increases are
seen for the flexible-weight indexes using the EKS and CCD methods. We will find even larger
increases due to the adjustment in Chinese prices as we next consider results based on the
expenditure function.

2.2 Expenditure Function Approach

Neary (2004) has recently proposed that real consumption should be measured with an
expenditure function. This avoids the substitution bias implied by fixed-weight indexes such as
GK, and allows for departures from homotheticity. The measure of real consumption at reference
prices  is:
M

e( , u j )   i qij* ,

j =1,…,C,

(6)

i 1

where we use an asterisk to denote optimally chosen quantities, as contrasted with the fixed
quantities in (1). The real consumption in country j relative to country k is then given by,

e( , u j )
e( , uk )

.

Neary argues that this formulation will give better estimates than using an index number method
because quantities respond to the reference prices.

9
The expenditure function approach could be implemented in many alternative ways. Her
we shall use the expenditure function corresponding to the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS)
of Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), which is given by:9
ln e( p, u )   0   'ln p 

1
2

M M

  ij ln pi ln p j  b( p )ln u ,

(7)

i 1 j 1

where b( p )    i pi i . We impose “money metric scaling”, which leads to the following
restrictions on the parameters:  0  0,   1. To ensure that the expenditure function is
homogeneous of degree one in prices we require that

i  i  1 and i  i  i  ij  0 for all j,

and to ensure that expenditure is increasing in utility we require that b( p )  0 . We report the

estimated parameter values using data on 124 countries and 12 commodity groups in Appendix
Table A2.10
We assume that the parameters of the expenditure function are common across countries.
Then it is immediate by computing e( , u j ) and e( , uk ) from (7) that the ratio of real
consumption in country j relative to k is:
e( , u j )

 uj 
 
e( , uk )  uk 

b( )

.

j =1,…,C.

(8)

For any reference prices , we refer to (8) as a measure of real consumption based on the
expenditure function, and it depends on the reference price vector .
To obtain a reference-price vector, Neary (2004) proposes that it should be computed as
the solution to:
9

Estimates are also available on request for the QUAIDS expenditure function of Banks et al. (1997), which extends
the AIDS model by adding a quadratic term in income. As in Neary (2004), this made relatively little difference in
practice, and also lacks the convenient theoretical properties that we exploit in (8) and subsequently.
10
These are estimated with the software provided in Neary (2004) for estimating the AIDS expenditure function
using the semi-parametric approach of Diewert and Wales (1988).

(10)

which extends the GK system in (1)-(2) by using optimal quantities qij* in the denominators of (9)
and (10). Notice that PPPj* is the ratio of the expenditure function at two different prices, but
constant utility, so it can be viewed as an exact cost-of-living index in the spirit of the Allen
index. 11 For this reason, Neary (2004) refers to (9)-(10) as the Geary-Allen International
Accounts (GAIA).
We have computed the GAIA reference prices  GAIA for the 124 countries and 12
consumption goods using Neary’s software. We follow his procedure of first normalizing the
prices of each goods by the arithmetic mean of the country prices, so that   1 is the sample
mean of prices. In Table 2 we report this sample mean along with the actual U.S. prices, the
Geary-Khamis reference prices  GK , the GAIA reference prices  GAIA , and the actual prices for
South Korea. It can be seen that the GK and GAIA reference prices fall in between those of the
United States and South Korea for most commodities.
From (8), it is evident that real income at any reference prices πB can be computed from
real income at any other reference prices πA by:



e( B , uk )  e( A , uk ) 
B

11

b( B )/ b( A )

,

(11)

Neary uses the reciprocal of (10), which he calls a “real exchange rate.” We instead follow the PWT convention
of using the purchasing power parity, defined as expenditure at domestic prices relative to expenditure at reference
prices.

11
so it is very easy to make the transformation between one reference price vector to another, as noted
by Feenstra, Hong and Rao (2009). At the bottom of Table 2 we report the values of
b( GK ) =0.996 and b( GAIA ) =1.026, which can be compared to b(1)  1 at the sample mean.

With these values, we can easily make the transformation between the real consumption based
on the GK reference prices in column (5) of Table 1, and real consumption based on Neary’s
GAIA reference prices reported in column (6). Using either the GK or GAIA reference prices, we
see in columns (5) and (6) of Table 1 that real consumption per capita in China is increased by
21% due to the adjustment in prices, which is even more than what we found for the
consumption indexes in column (2)–(4).
A final reference-price calculation we shall make is due to a suggestion by Barnett,
Diewert and Zellner (2009). To compare the real consumption of two countries j and k, they
recommend that every country’s price vector p ,  =1,…,C, be used, and then take the
geometric mean of the resulting comparisons. From (9), this procedure results in:

(12)

Thus, it is apparent that in the AIDS case this recommendation corresponds to the use of

 

reference prices  D where b  D 

1 C
 b p  ;we refer to these as “Diewert reference prices”
C  1

for brevity. For our sample of 124 countries we obtain b( D ) = 0.988, and it turns out that
b( D )  [b( us )b( kor )]0.5 , which means that the Diewert reference prices are equivalent to
using the geometric mean of the U.S. and South Korean prices. With these values for b( D )
column (7) of Table 1 is readily computed. Like the other expenditure function methods, real
consumption in China is revised upwards by about 21% due to the adjustment in its prices. Using

12
these prices, we find that real consumption per capita in China is 6.6% of that in the United
States, which is the highest of any consumption estimate shown in Table 1.
We conclude that the downward bias in real consumption from the ICP’s use of urban
prices for China is quite substantial: roughly 10% for the consumption indexes and 20% when
using the expenditure function. The question we address next is how these higher estimates for
real consumption influence the total measure of real GDP.

3. Real GDP on the Expenditure Side

PWT defines real GDP by using the fixed-weight index in (3) to convert nominal exports
and imports, or nominal GDP, to real GDP measured in dollars across countries:
RGDPje  (Nominal GDPj )/ PPPje

=

 i1 ie qij + (Xj – Mj) / PPPje
M

where the equality follows from nominal GDPj =

(13)

 i 1 pij qij + (Xj – Mj), where Xj and Mj are the
M

nominal values of export and imports. Note that qij and PPPje are defined as in (2) and (3), but
now computed over all final goods, i.e. for consumption, investment and government
expenditures. We use the superscript e on real GDPe to stress that this is an expenditure-based
measure, since the price used to compute PPPje are those for final goods only. As discussed by
Feenstra, Heston et al (2009), this measure of real GDP is intended to reflect the living standards
or consumption possibilities of an economy. In the next section we will discuss an alternative
output-based measure, real GDPo, that reflects the production possibilities of an economy.

13
3.1 Estimates of Real GDPe in 2005

Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011) compute (13) for all countries included in the 2005
ICP. The preliminary results of this calculation for China and selected other countries are shown
in column (8) of Table 1. For China, without making any adjustment to the ICP prices, we find
that real GDPe per-capita is $5,097 in 2005, or 25% larger than the estimate of $4,088 from the
World Bank (2008a). The difference between these two estimates can only come from one of
two sources: (i) the use of the EKS method by the ICP/World Bank, rather than the GK method
used here; (ii) the fact that the ICP/World Bank does not compute the real GDPs over all
countries simultaneously, but rather, used certain “link” countries across regions and then
computes regional and intra-regional real GDP based on the linking methodology described by
Diewert (2010b). Heston (2007) and Deaton and Heston (2010) argue that this linking method
probably leads to an understatement of Chinese real GDP, which we confirm. Surprisingly,
however, the understatement of real GDP for India is not as large, which we report as $2,423 in
Table 1 or about 10% larger than the estimate of $2,222 from the World Bank (2008a).
We also compute real GDPe using the same adjustment to the Chinese prices for final
consumption goods used in the earlier sections. This adjustment to the final consumption goods
is combined with unadjusted prices for investment and government expenditures, since these
were not subject to the same urban bias in their collection, obtaining the results reported at the
bottom of Table 1. Using the adjusted prices for final consumption goods, we find that real GDPe
per-capita in China is $5,543, or a further 8.8% higher than the unadjusted estimate of $5,097.
Comparing these estimates with the World Bank (2008a) figure of $4,088, we conclude that the
World Bank underestimates real GDPe in China by fully 25 – 35%.

14
3.2 Comparison with PWT 7.0

Given the very large difference between our estimate of real GDPe in China and that of
the World Bank, it is useful to compare our estimates to those from PWT version 7.0, available
online since June 3, 2011, at: http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu/. PWT reports two sets of estimates for
China, labeled as “China version 1”, with per-capita real GDP of $4,736 in 2005, and “China
version 2” with per-capita real GDP of $5,218. Both of those estimates use the GK system, and
the difference between them is for an adjustment to the ICP prices for China: “version 2” lowers
all the prices for Chinese consumption goods by 20%, as described in the online documentation
“Description of PWT 7.0 (June 3, 2011),” resulting in a 10% increase in real GDP.
We find a slightly lower 8.8% increase when adjusting the prices of consumer goods,
from $5,097 to $5,543, but of roughly the same magnitude as PWT. That gives us confidence in
the specific adjustments to the consumer prices that we made. Still, our estimates of real GDP –
both with and without the adjustment to consumer prices – are higher than reported in PWT
version 7. Because all estimates use the GK system, this difference must be due to differing
reference prices, which in turn are quite sensitive to the set of countries used in the calculation.
Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011) compute real GDP as in (13) for all countries included in
the 2005 ICP, and in addition, all countries that were included in any former ICP benchmarks but
were not used in 2005. The latter set of countries have their ICP prices for C, I and G aggregated
within the benchmark year and then moved up to 2005 using those respective rates of inflation
relative to the United States. So in the end, 167 countries are used to compute real GDP in 2005.
In contrast, PWT encompasses a broader group of 189 countries, some 22 of which have
never been included in an ICP benchmark, and with various extrapolation methods used to infer
what the ICP-equivalent prices in these countries would be. Because the GK calculation in PWT

15
is made over this broader set of countries, and those being added are lower-income countries,
that will move the reference prices in the direction of developing countries’ prices. When
China’s real GDP is computed with reference prices more typical of developing countries, its
real GDP will fall.12 We believe this factor accounts for the differing estimates of real GDP in
Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011) and PWT version 7.0.13
4. Real GDP on the Output-Side

We will now establish results for real GDP on the output-side. Suppose that the M final
goods now include those used for consumption, investment and government purchases, all of
which are non-traded. In addition, suppose that there are i =M+1,…,M+N intermediate inputs
that can be both imported and exported (imports and exports are different varieties). This
convention that all traded goods are by definition intermediate inputs follows the “production
approach” to modeling imports and exports of Diewert and Morrison (1986) and Kohli (2004), or
the “middle products” approach of Sanyal and Jones (1982).
Specifically, let us denote three groups of commodities:

12



those for final domestic demand (quantities qij  0 and prices p ij > 0, for i = 1,…,M);



those for exports (quantities xij  0 and prices pijx > 0, for i = M+1,…,M+N);



imported intermediate inputs (quantities mij  0 and prices pijm > 0, i = M+1,…,M+N).

Samuelson (1974) summarizes this principle as “it always looks better to ride the other fellow's horse”, or in the
words of Robert Summers, “the grass is greener on the other side,” meaning that real GDP tends to be higher when
prices different from a country’s own are used. It is an illustration of what is called more formally the Gershenkron
(1951) Effect.
13
Having found that our own estimates are not that different from PWT, the remaining feature is that both sets of
estimates differ in a consistent manner from the World Bank (2008a). As noted above, that difference must come
from one of two sources: (i) the use of the EKS method by the ICP/World Bank, rather than the GK method used
here; (ii) the fact that the ICP/World Bank does not compute the real GDPs over all countries simultaneously, but
rather, used certain “link” countries across. PWT version 7.0 assesses the first of these reasons by providing another
measure of real GDP, called “cgdp2” and referred to as “average GEKS-CPDW.” This calculation uses the EKS
method. For “China version 1,” per-capita real GDP is $4,813 in 2005, and for “China version 2,” per-capita real
GDP is $5,366 that year. Both of these estimates exceed that obtained by PWT using the GK system. Evidently, the
use of EKS by the World Bank cannot explain its low estimate for China’s real GDP, which leaves the use of “link
countries” – or other unknown factors – as the culprit.

16
The world price vectors for exports and imports are p xj and p mj in country j, and domestic
prices are p xj  s j and p mj  t j . We use sj and tj to denote the vectors of export subsidies and
import tariffs respectively, though differences between home and world prices may also reflect
natural trade costs. The column vector of prices is then Pj = ( p j , p xj  s j , p mj  t j ) , and we let
y j  ( q j , x j ,  m j ) denote the corresponding column vector of outputs and inputs. Then the

revenue function for the economy is defined as:
rj ( Pj , v j ) 

max
qij , xij , mij  0,

Pj ' y j



Fj ( y j , v j )  1 ,

(14)

where F j ( y j , v j ) is a transformation function for each country, which depends on the vector vj

representing primary factor endowments in country j, and also depends in the subscript j
representing differences in technologies across countries.

4.1 Real Output with Reference Prices

We will distinguish the reference prices  i for final goods, i =1,…,M, and two sets of
reference prices  ix ,  im for exports and imported intermediate inputs, i =M+1,…,M+N. Denote
the M+2N dimensional vector of reference prices by   ( , x , m ) . We suppose that the
country is engaged in free trade at these reference prices, and evaluate GDP on the output-side
using the revenue function:

RGDO*j (  )  rj (  , v j ) 

max
qij , xij , mij 0,

 ' y j



Fj ( y j , v j )  1 .

(15)

Provided that F j ( y j , v j ) is sufficiently concave we can expect (15) to have a well-defined
solution, which we denote by qij* , xij* , mij* . Let us make this assumption on the revenue function:

17
Assumption 1: For all  > 0, rj ( , v j ) is positive, bounded above and continuously

differentiable.
In economic terms, the assumption that the revenue function is positive implies that, even if the
price of an imported intermediate input is very high, the country can economize on its imports to
still produce positive revenue; while the assumption that it has an upper bound means that the
economy cannot make arbitrarily high revenue by importing some inputs and exporting other
goods.
To obtain real GDP on the output-side, we shall use the reference prices  to obtain
final demands, net outputs, exports and imports as qij*  rj (  , v j ) /  i , i =1,…,M, and,

xij*  rj (  , v j ) /  ix ,  mij*  rj (  * , v j ) /  im , i =M+1,…,M+N. We assume that the sum
across countries of each of these quantities is strictly positive:

Assumption 2:

For all  > 0,

 0, i = 1,…,M, and

for i = M+1,…,N.

j 1

Notice that this assumption applies to the observed prices Pj > 0 and quantities, too.
Consider computing the reference prices as a weighted average of free-trade prices:
J

 i   ( pij / PPPj* )qij

(19)

Thus, in (16)–(19) we use the optimal quantities in the denominators, but the observed quantities
in the numerators. In (19), the purchasing power parity on the output-side, PPPj* , is computed
by comparing nominal GDP to real GDP at free-trade reference prices. The system defined in
(16)–(19) is an extension of the GAIA system in Neary (2004) by introducing exports and
imports explicitly into the system. In order to be able to use this system, we need to demonstrate
the existence of a positive solution for  i ,  ix ,  im and PPPj* . We follow Neary (2004) in
proving the following result.

Proposition 1

Under Assumptions 1 and 2, there exists a positive solution for  i ,  ix ,  im and PPPj* satisfying
the system (16) – (19).
Proof: See Appendix B.

Using the reference prices coming from Proposition 1, or any other, we can make
comparisons across countries of real GDP on the output-side – or real output for short – using
the ratio of revenue functions:
rj (  , v j )
rk (  , vk )

.

(20)

We first show how this can be implemented using a fixed-weight index, and then discuss in
Section 4.3 the implications of estimating the revenue function directly.

19
4.2 Fixed-Weight Index on the Output-side

The measure of real GDP on the output-side, or real GDPo, is defined by Feenstra, Heston
et al (2009) using reference prices for final outputs io , exports ix and imports im , as:
RGDPjo

where the equality follows by defining the PPPs of exports and imports, over the traded goods

As in the GK system (1)–(2), one normalization is needed in the system (21)–(26). This system
extends the GK system by adding information on export and import prices and quantities.

20
We follow Feenstra, Heston et al (2009) in rewriting RGDPjo to give a clear
interpretation of the difference between it and RGDPje . Notice that RGDPjo in (21) can be
decomposed as:
RGDPjo

  M  io qij

(27)

We can define the three ratios appearing in (27) as the inverse of the PPP’s for final expenditure,
exports and imports, the latter two already given in (22):
PPPjq

  M pij qij 
  iM1 o  .
   i qij 

It will be convenient to work instead with the associated price levels for final goods, exports and
imports, obtained by dividing the PPP’s by the nominal exchange rate Ej:
PLej 

PPPje

PLqj 

PPPjq

RGDPje  RGDPjo

(28)

We will find in practice that PLej and PLqj are quite similar, since they are both computed from
final expenditures, but with different reference prices. If these two deflators for final expenditure
are equal, then either PLxj > PLej or PLmj < PLej is needed to have real GDPje exceed real
GDPjo , and both inequalities holding is sufficient for this. To interpret these conditions, having

21
export prices above their reference level and import prices below their reference level will
contribute towards RGDPje exceeding RGDPjo . For example, proximity to markets that allow
for higher export prices would work in this direction, but being distant from markets leading to
high import prices would work in the opposite direction, raising PLmj and tending to make
RGDPje less than RGDPjo .

Empirical implementation of the fixed weight index from the output-side described in
equations (23)-(26) is currently being undertaken as a part of the next generation PWT
methodology described in Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011), using the 2005 ICP benchmark.
Earlier results for 1996 are reported in Feenstra, Heston et al (2009), who use the normalization
that RGDPje equals RGDPjo when summed across the 1996 sample of countries. China
was not included in the 1996 ICP benchmark, but we can give preliminary results for 2005 from
Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011), using the same normalization that RGDPje equals RGDPjo
when summed across the 2005 sample of countries.14 The complete results are shown in the final
column of Table A1, and results for selected countries are in Table 1.
We see from Table 1 that per-capita RGDPjo for China exceeds RGDPje , so China is
even bigger when viewed from its ability to produce goods. To see where this calculation comes
from, we compute (28) as:
RGDPje  RGDPjo
RGDPje

As noted in section 3.2, Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011) compute real GDPe and real GDPo for countries in
the 2005 ICP and any earlier benchmark, by carrying forward prices for C, I and G for the latter group of countries
using their respective rates of inflation relative to the U.S. Thus, while the 2005 ICP includes 146 countries, their
calculations are over a broader set of 167 countries. For brevity in Appendix Table A1, we report results only for the
124 countries that had complete data on consumption prices, and therefore already appear in the table.
14

22
The first term appearing on the right of (28) is zero, because the price levels PLej and PLqj , both
computed over final goods only, are equal at 0.32. The price level for Chinese exports is 0.45, or
slightly less than one-half of the reservation prices for exports, while the price level for imports
is 0.68. That means the terms of trade for China is 0.45/0.68 < 1, so RGDPje is less than
RGDPjo . This holds even though nominal exports are larger than nominal imports, which would

tend to make RGDPje exceed RGDPjo (i.e. as would occur if the price levels for exports and
equal were equal but above that for final goods). So we see that real GDP on the output side for
China is higher than that on the expenditure side, by about 6%. This means that RGDPjo exceeds
the World Bank estimate of real GDP by more than 40%.15
Finally, recall that this estimate of real GDP is based on the normalization that world
GDP is the same whether calculated on the output or expenditure basis. Mirroring the fact that
China and other developing countries have higher real GDP from an output perspective, Table 1
also shows that real GDP on the output-side for the United States falls relative to real GDP on
the expenditure-side, from $41,553 to $39,550 per-capita. Thus, taking the ratio of real GDP on
the output-side for China relative to the U.S., we obtain $5,862/$39,550 or 15%, using the
adjusted Chinese prices. That is fully 50% higher than the ratio of real GDP from the World
Bank in 2005, which is $4,088/$41,674 or 9.8%. On this basis, we conclude that real GDP in
China relative to the United States is quite plausibly 50% higher than estimated by the World
Bank (2008a).

15

This estimate is not significantly affected by the nominal undervaluation of the Chinese currency. If the renminbi
were to appreciate, this would raise the absolute values of the price levels of both exports and imports, 0.45 and
0.68. This would be neutral if trade were balanced, and would raise real GNP on the expenditure side relative to that
on the output side slightly (as measured by these fixed-weight indexes) reflecting a relatively small wealth transfer
to Chinese consumers (both public and private).

23
The finding that RGDPjo exceeds RGDPje holds for the other developing countries and
newly-industrialized countries in Table 1, with the reverse comparison holding for the developed
countries. This illustrates the tendency for the developed countries to have strong terms of trade
which tend to make (28) positive. There are many exceptions to this tendency, however. Norway,
for example, has the highest value of RGDPjo , at $58,842 per-capita in Table A1, which is more
than 25% above its per-capita RGDPje , at $46,242. This result comes from a low term of trade
for Norway, which can be traced to unusually high import prices. Conversely, Chad has RGDPjo
at $4,030 per-capita in Table A1, which is 25% below its per-capita RGDPje , at $5,373. That
result, in turn, can be traced to a strong terms of trade. So the terms of trade faced by countries
are positively but only weakly correlated with the real GDP.

4.3 Revenue Function Approach

The fixed-weight estimates in the previous sub-section do not take account of substitution
bias on the production side. However, we do not view it as feasible to estimate the revenue
function in (14) across a comprehensive set of countries in the same way that Neary (2004)
estimates the expenditure function. The reason for this is that (14) depends on a full set of factor
endowments vj that differ across countries, and also depends on the subscript j representing
differences in technologies across countries. Both of these features represent formidable hurdles
to estimation. But there is one theoretical result we can provide which suggests that real GDP in
China would be even bigger if measured using the revenue function approach.
To obtain this result, let   ( , x , m ) denote the reference prices used to compute
RGDPjo (  ) in (21). Then because the quantities in (21) are feasible to produce but not optimal

at the prices  , it follows that:

24
RGDPjo (  )  rj (  , v j ) .

(29)

Using this inequality we can obtain a result on the comparison of real GDP on the output-side
across countries. Consider reference prices that equal the observed prices of a high-income
country j,   Pj  ( p j , p xj , p mj ). Then it is immediate that RGDPjo  rj ( Pj , v j ) , while
RGDPko ( Pj )  rk ( Pj , vk ) for all other countries k. It follows that,

RGDPko ( Pj )
RGDPjo ( Pj )



rk ( Pj , vk )
rj ( Pj , v j )

.

(30)

That is, with reference prices close to those of a high-income country j, the ratio of output-side
real GDP for any lower-income country k relative to country j will be even greater using the
revenue function than in the fixed-weight GK approach. In particular, this suggests that real GDP
in China relative to the U.S. could be even higher using the revenue function, if this approach
were feasible to implement.

5. Conclusions

In this paper we have analyzed the revision to real GDP for China made by the World
Bank using prices from the 2005 round of the International Comparison Program. Because those
prices were higher than expected for China, the corresponding estimate of real GDP in China
was lowered: from $6,757 per-capita in World Bank (2007) to $4,088 in World Bank (2008a).
Possible reasons for this downward revision have been discussed by Deaton and Heston (2010),
and here we provide a quantitative evaluation of the possibilities.
Our first objective was to examine the sensitivity of real consumption comparisons to the
choice of the index number methods used. We included the fixed-weight GK index, three
variations of flexible weight indexes, the EKS and CCD indexes along with the index suggested

25
by Barnett, Diewert and Zellner (2009), and finally, the expenditure function approach of Neary
(2004). In all cases we compare estimates for real consumption in China after making
adjustments to prices reported in the 2005 ICP comparisons in the Asia-Pacific region. Making
use of a regression model to explain commodity-specific price levels as a function of real per
capita income in other Asian countries, and applying the resulting adjustments to price data for
China, we measure the revisions to be anywhere between 9% to 21% depending upon the index
number method used. Our results confirm that an upward revision of real consumption in China
somewhere between 10 to 20 percent is quite realistic.
We then moved to calculation of total real GDP, including investment, government and
the trade balance. We find that the GK estimate of real GDP on the expenditure-side for China is
$5,097 in 2005, which is 25% larger than the estimate from the World Bank of $4,088. If we
adjust the prices of consumption goods, then real GDPe per-capita rises to $5,543, or another
10%. Furthermore, from Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer (2011), preliminary estimates of real
GDP measured on the output-side for China are obtained, which are $5,433 per-capita without
the adjustment to consumption prices and $5,862 with this adjustment. The latter estimate is
nearly 45% higher than the World Bank figure of $4,088. Furthermore, the same calculation,
switching from expenditure to output, lowers U.S. real per-capita GDP from $41,553 to $39,550.
Relative to this, China’s real GDP per capita is $5,862/$39,550 or 15%, using the adjusted
Chinese prices, fully 50% higher than the ratio of real GDP from the World Bank in 2005. Thus
our final estimate of real per-capita GDP in China relative to the United States in 2005 is that is
50% higher than estimated by the World Bank (2008a).

Appendix A: Data and Estimates

In Table A1 we report the calculations of real consumption for all 124 countries. In Table
A2 we report the estimates of the AIDS expenditure function, listing first the R2 values for the
share equations for each product and then the parameters α, β and Γ.16
In Table A3 we report the correction made to Chinese prices for 2005. As noted in the text,
we used a regression approach to determine predicted prices for China. A simple regression
model is used with the price level (ratio of PPP to exchange rate) for each commodity group is
expressed as a function of the real income per capita index. The real income per capita index is
computed using the real per capital income estimates from the ICP Asia-Pacific 2005 which are
based on the EKS index number formula. The real incomes are expressed as index relative to the
Asian Region =100. All the relevant data are drawn from the Final Report of the ICP AsiaPacific (ADB, 2007) and the sample is restricted to all Asian countries except China. The total
number of countries in the Asia-Pacific comparison was 23 including China..17
A log-linear model with a dummy variable for Fiji is our chosen model, and a separate
regression is run for each of the commodities except alcoholic beverages. 18 The predicted prices
from these regressions are shown in Table A2. Using these predicted or “adjusted” prices for
China we also re-estimated the AIDS expenditure function, but it is essentially unchanged from
Table A1 because data for only one country out of 124 has been adjusted. Using the AIDS
estimates we can compute the estimated shares for China, using actual or predicted prices. These
are shown in Table A2 together with the actual shares. It can be seen that the adjustment to the
16

These estimates are taken from Feenstra, Ma and Prasada Rao (2009).
As fixity of the regional comparisons was maintained in the global comparisons and that there could be regional
differences in the regression relationships, it was decided that only data on countries from the Asian region would be
utilized in the regressions.
18
A linear model with a dummy variable for Fiji also performed well, and gave results quite similar to those
obtained with the log-linear model. The rationale for excluding Fiji is that, as an island economy where most
consumer and investment goods are imported, its national price level is a lot higher than comparable economies, so
it is an outlier in terms of the theory explaining national price levels.
17

27
shares is not that large, but nevertheless, the estimated shares using predicted prices are closer to
the actual shares for food and non-alcoholic beverages, recreation, and restaurants.

Appendix B: Proof of Proposition 1

We first derive a reduced system either in the international prices vector, Π, or in the
output-based real exchange rates, RO. Following Neary (2004), we start with an international
price vector Π0 which is positive. Then using Π0 in (19), we get a value for ROj for j=1,2,…,C.
Substituting these ROj’s into (16), (17) and (18) yields a new price vector Π1. Thus we have a
function that maps Π0 to Π1. We represent this relationship by:
1  H ( o ) or in general,  t  H ( t 1 )

(A1)

Equation (A1) represents a system of non-linear simultaneous equations. We can state the
following general properties of H: (i) H is positive for all Π0 >0 ; (ii) H is linearly homogeneous;
and (iii) H is a continuous function. These properties follow from the structure of the equations
(16) to (19) and the assumed properties of the revenue function.
Further we observe that if Π is a solution to equations (16) to (19), then kΠ is also a
solution for any k>0. This means that we can have a solution that is unique up to a factor of
proportionality. Thus we can restrict ourselves to solutions of (A2) up to a linear restriction



M 2 N
i 1

 i  1 with πi > 0. This basically means the mapping H in (A2) is a mapping from the unit

simplex into itself. Further H is continuous. From Brower’s fixed point theorem there exists a
fixed point Π* such that Π*=H (Π*). We note here that uniqueness of the fixed point is not
guaranteed by this theorem.19

19

Likewise, Neary (2004) proves the existence of a unique positive solution to the Geary system but only shows the
existence of a positive solution to the GAIA system.

Notes: Column (1) gives the nominal consumption expenditure (obtained using exchange rates for
converting national currency data into US dollars) per capita in 2005, relative to the US. Column (2) gives
the Geary-Khamis calculation of real consumption. Columns (3)-(4) present flexible weight measures of
real consumption expenditure per capita, using respectively the EKS, and CCD methods, as defined in the
text in equations (4)-(5). Columns (5) to (7) show measures of real consumption based on the estimated
AIDS expenditure function, using different reference prices: column (5) uses the Geary-Khamis reference
prices; column (6) uses the GAIA reference prices; and column (7) uses every country’s prices as
reference and then takes the geometric mean of the results, as in Diewert (2009). Column (8) shows real
GDPe per capita on the expenditure-side, while column (9) shows GDPo per capita on the output-side. The
results in the second-last row use adjusted prices for China as described in Appendix A, and the
percentage in the final row is computed relative to the China estimate above.
