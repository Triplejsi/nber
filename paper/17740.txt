The Housing Wealth Effect: The Crucial Roles of Demographics, Wealth Distribution and
Wealth Shares
Charles W. Calomiris, Stanley D. Longhofer, and William Miles
NBER Working Paper No. 17740
January 2012
JEL No. E21,J11
ABSTRACT
Current estimates of housing wealth effects vary widely. We consider the role of omitted variables
suggested by economic theory that have been absent in a number of prior studies. Our estimates take
into account age composition and wealth distribution (using poverty rates as a proxy), as well as wealth
shares (how much of total wealth is comprised of housing vs. stock wealth). We exploit cross-state
variation in housing, stock wealth and other variables in a newly assembled panel data set and find
that the impact of housing on consumer spending depends crucially on age composition, poverty rates,
and the housing wealth share. In particular, young people who are more likely to be credit-constrained,
and older homeowners, likely to be “trading down” on their housing stock, experience the largest housing
wealth effects, as suggested by theory. Also, as suggested by theory, housing wealth effects are higher
in state-years with higher housing wealth shares, and in state-years with higher poverty rates (likely
reflecting the greater importance of credit constraints for those observations). Taking these various
factors into account implies huge variation over time and across states in the size of housing wealth
effects.

I. Introduction
If the value of your house rose by $10,000 this year, by how much would your
consumption this year rise? It is a straightforward question, yet economists have failed to agree
on an answer to it that is consistent with the theoretical modeling of consumption wealth effects,
as evidenced by the (wide-ranging) empirical estimates of their magnitude.
In theory, estimation of wealth effects should take into account variation related to age
and the composition of wealth. Consumers with different age and wealth characteristics should
have different housing wealth effects. Those that face binding constraints that limit their
borrowing against future income or those that plan to downsize their housing consumption
significantly should exhibit relatively large housing wealth effects, while those that neither face
binding borrowing constraints nor are planning to downsize their housing consumption in the
near term should exhibit smaller housing wealth effects.
Empirical evidence on aggregate housing wealth effects has produced widely varying
estimates. A number of problems have made it difficult to interpret the sources of empirical
disagreements across studies. First is the challenge of finding reliable data on housing wealth,
securities wealth, consumption and other variables of interest. Although good measures of these
variables exist for the U.S. as a whole, aggregation over regions with different economic cycles
and limited degrees of freedom from time series aggregates make it difficult to obtain reliable
estimates of consumers’ responses to variation in wealth and income. In principle, the crosssectional variation in panel data for U.S. states would provide additional estimation power. In
practice, however, finding reliable state-level data is a challenge. For example, state-level
consumption is typically proxied using retail sales, while data on securities wealth is estimated
by allocating aggregate figures across states using household surveys on mutual fund holdings.

1

This is particularly problematic because these surveys are only available for a handful of years,
forcing researchers to interpolate across many intervening quarters.
Second, wealth effect estimates are acutely prone to bias due to omitted variables. For
example, in a regression that omits unobservable permanent income, housing wealth changes
(which likely are correlated with omitted expected future income) may proxy for the omitted
variable; thus, observed housing wealth effects may overstate true wealth effects. Calomiris, et
al. (2009), following Campbell and Mankiw (1990), employ instrumental variables to address
that problem, and find that taking account of this bias substantially reduces estimated housing
wealth effects (see also Case, et al., 2011, who adopt that same approach).
Third, the functional forms for estimating wealth effects in prior work generally are not
consistent with some of the basic implications of the permanent-income/life-cycle model of
consumption. As Carroll and Zhou (2011) have noted, coefficient estimates from the standard
empirical functional form that regresses the log of consumption (or its difference) on the logs of
income, housing wealth, and securities wealth (or their differences) cannot be interpreted as
measuring a standard wealth effect; instead they simply measure partial correlations between
housing (or equities) and consumption.
A particular problem with regressions using the standard functional form is that they
posit a constant elasticity of consumption with respect to housing wealth. The reasonableness of
this assumption, however, depends on the constancy of the ratio of housing wealth to securities
wealth. If the housing wealth ratio is not constant, then assuming constant elasticities in
estimation can result in severe bias. To see why, consider two individuals, A and B, both of
whom earn $50,000 per year and consume $55,000. Individual A possesses $1,000 in securities
wealth and $500,000 in housing wealth, while individual B possesses $500,000 in securities

2

wealth and $1,000 in housing wealth. Suppose that actual individual behavior follows the
following pattern: consumption equals 80% of current income plus 3% of total wealth,
irrespective of whether wealth is in housing or securities.
Suppose that one employs the standard functional form: ln
ln , where is consumption, is current income,
,

,

, and

ln

ln

is housing wealth, is stock wealth, and

are parameters to be estimated. Suppose that one runs this specification on a

sample that pools together a population of many individuals, consisting of equal numbers of
types A and B, and further suppose that the estimated elasticity of consumption with respect to
housing wealth from that regression (parameter

) is 0.015. That estimate suggests that a 1

percent increase in housing wealth should give rise to a 1.5 percent increase in consumption. But
that estimate is not close to accurate for either type of individual in the population. For Type A
individuals, when housing values rise by 1 percent, consumption rises by roughly 3 percent,
since almost all of type A’s wealth is in housing. For type B individuals, consumption is
virtually unaffected when housing values rise by 1 percent, since housing wealth is a trivial
fraction of total wealth. One contribution of our paper is that we address this wealthheterogeneity problem by allowing the elasticity of consumption with respect to different types
of wealth changes to vary with the ratios of each type of wealth to total wealth.
Finally, as the theoretical insights of Buiter (2007) and Sinai and Souleles (2005)
emphasize, the demographic characteristics of the population should matter for housing wealth
effects. If older people are more likely to downsize and younger people are more likely to face
binding borrowing constraints against expected future income, then both young and old people
should exhibit larger housing wealth effects relative to people who are neither young nor old.

3

Thus, in a panel analysis of U.S. states, heterogeneity across states or over time with respect to
age distribution should have important implications for housing and securities wealth effects.
Along a similar line of reasoning, we posit that the distribution of wealth should matter to
the extent that borrowing constraints bind (which should raise estimated wealth effects of
consumption). Specifically, we allow wealth effects to depend on the extent of poverty in a
state. We expect that higher incidence of poverty (which, more broadly, reflects the share of the
population with low levels of per capita wealth) will be associated with higher wealth effects
because a greater proportion of low-wealth individuals (including homeowners) should be
associated with more binding constraints on borrowing against permanent income.
In this paper, we deal with all of these considerations when estimating consumption
wealth effects for housing and securities. First, we construct a new annual dataset for the U.S.
states for the period 1981-2009. By focusing on annual data, we are able to avoid excessive
interpolation of missing values. Second, we employ the same instrumental variables approach
used in Calomiris, et al. (2009). Unlike that study, we find housing wealth effects are positive
and significant after instrumenting. We attribute this change to improvement in the quality of the
data employed in the present study.
Third, as suggested by life-cycle consumption theory, we demonstrate that an empirical
specification that takes into account the relative amount of housing and securities wealth in a
given state-year improves the accuracy of the estimation. This reflects the fact that there is
substantial variation across states and over time in the composition of wealth.
Fourth, taking account of demographic variation (differences in age and poverty rates)
also proves to be important, both across states and over time. As suggested by theory, housing
wealth effects tend to be larger in state-years with high proportions of young and old people, and
4

those with higher poverty rates. Given the substantial variation across states and over time in
these population characteristics (reflecting, in part, the differential effects of the baby boom
across states), it turns out to be important to take demographic differences into account when
measuring wealth effects.
Overall, we find that consumption responds positively to innovations in both housing
wealth and securities wealth, but housing wealth effects are significantly larger than stock wealth
effects. On average, a one dollar increase in the value of housing wealth raises consumption by
roughly five to eight cents. In contrast, a one dollar increase in the value of securities wealth
raises consumption by less than two cents on average. Importantly, there is substantial variation
across states and over time in both of these consumption responses to wealth changes, which are
related to changes in the age, poverty and wealth characteristics of the population over time. The
responsiveness of consumption to changes in different types of wealth should therefore be
understood within the historical context of the importance of housing wealth as a fraction of total
wealth, and the demographic and wealth composition characteristics of the population.
Section II briefly reviews the literature on estimating the consumption elasticity of
housing and stock wealth. Section III describes our dataset. Section IV presents our empirical
findings, while Section V concludes.

II. Previous Literature
Standard analysis of consumption decisions in a PIH framework indicates that an increase
in the value of an agent’s assets should cause the agent to increase consumption. Poterba (2000)
summarizes the issues and findings relating to consumption effects of increases in stock values.

5

He points out that, even in the absence of credit constraints or other imperfections, agents that
are rational, forward-looking optimizers should increase consumption in response to the higher
wealth that stock price increases create. It is therefore unsurprising that a number of papers
(Ludvigson and Steindel, 1999, is one of many examples) find a significant, positive
consumption wealth effect from increases in stock wealth.
Housing shares some similarity to equity in that it is an asset, and thus there may be a
wealth effect on consumption from an increase in housing values. However, housing is also a
consumption good, and a wealth effect from higher home prices is not as theoretically obvious as
in the case of stocks. Buiter (2007) quotes Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, who stated
that “housing wealth isn’t wealth.” The value of a house is simply the present value of the
housing services it delivers in the future. Those who have more housing than they plan on
consuming in the future (those who are net “long” housing) will be better off from an increase in
house prices, and may as a result increase consumption; those owning less housing than they
plan to consume in the future will be made worse off, and may decrease consumption as a result.
On average, since most residents own the houses in which they live, there should be little net
housing wealth effect. Buiter thus presents a model in which the only way a net housing wealth
effect is generated is through distributional considerations that result in small net wealth effects.
Sinai and Souleles (2005) also develop a theoretical model in which aggregate housing
wealth effects should be relatively small for aggregate non-housing consumption. Their model,
however, takes borrowing constraints into account, which makes it possible for housing wealth
to exert a larger effect on consumption. Because future income cannot be credibly pledged to
lenders, the possession of housing wealth can increase current consumption for borrowers with
high expected future income growth. Indeed, housing wealth may be superior to stock wealth as
6

collateral, since maximum permissible loan-to-value ratios on mortgages are much higher than
margin limits on stocks, and because mortgage interest is tax-deductible, while margin loan
interest is not. As in Buiter (2007), an increase in house prices causes higher housing asset
values, but also an equivalent increase in housing liabilities (the cost of future housing
consumption) ; any effect from increases in housing values on non-housing consumption,
therefore, primarily reflects the impact of the relaxation of borrowing constraints on consumers
(given housing’s special value as collateral for consumer borrowing).
Thus, theoretically it is not at all clear that a substantial housing wealth effect on
aggregate non-housing consumption should be observed; the size of the effect depends on the
proportion of the population subject to binding borrowing constraints, and the distribution of the
wealth in the population that is either net long or net short housing. The housing wealth effect
may be greatest for younger homeowners who are most likely to suffer from credit constraints, or
for older homeowners who are contemplating imminent downsizing.
Given the theoretical ambiguities of the housing wealth effect, a number of papers have
attempted to empirically gauge the impact of rising home prices on consumption, and compare
that housing wealth effect with the effect of stock wealth changes on consumption. Carroll, et al.
(2011) examine the housing wealth effect in the context of a habit formation model using
aggregate time series data. The authors find that consumption rises more in response to housing
than to stock wealth.
Carroll and Zhou (2011) use a panel data set of U.S. states to examine the housing wealth
effect; the authors find a positive housing wealth effect, but no significant stock wealth effect.
They construct new data on consumption and financial wealth at the state level semi-annually
that is likely more accurate than the data used in some previous papers. As in the present study,
7

the authors employ data based on the FHFA home price index.1 A major limitation of their data,
however, is that it only runs from 2001 through 2005. This is a much shorter span than prior
panel-based studies, which often have data covering three decades or more. As a result, the
Carroll and Zhou (2011) data set misses out on most of the more volatile and infamous national
and local housing cycles over the past 30 years.
Several studies employ micro data on households. Mian and Sufi (2011) analyze data on
75,000 existing homeowners over time and across Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and
conclude that the recent housing boom boosted consumption in the United States. Like us, Mian
and Sufi analyze how age and financing constraints affect wealth effects, finding that younger
homeowners and those with low credit scores and greater reliance on credit card borrowing
(which may proxy for financing constraints) respond more to a rise in home values by borrowing
against the value of their homes. Bostic, et al. (2009) examine data from both the Survey of
Consumer Finances and the Consumer Expenditure Survey, finding that housing wealth appears
most highly associated with non-durable consumption, while financial wealth is most closely
linked with expenditures on durables.
One of the most highly cited studies on housing wealth effects is Case, Quigley and
Shiller (CQS, 2005). This study uses a panel of quarterly data for US states running 1982-1999,
as well as a panel of fourteen OECD countries using annual data over the same period. The
authors later updated this study (CQS, 2011); the new panel data set (for U.S. states only in this
version) runs from 1978-2009.

FHFA (the Federal Housing Finance Agency) was formerly known as the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight (OFHEO).

8

CQS (2005, 2011) estimate the effects of wealth on consumption in a variety of ways.
First, they model the level of consumption as a function of the level of income, and stock and
housing wealth. Next, they model the difference in consumption as a function of differences in
housing, stock wealth and income. CQS also estimate a version of an error correction model, in
which the parameters of the cointegrating vector are imposed (income affects consumption oneto-one). In all of these specifications, housing wealth is found to have a positive and significant
effect on consumption, and in nearly all cases, the housing wealth coefficient is larger than that
of stock wealth. While the 2005 study only covers the years 1982-1999 and misses the latest
dramatic rise and fall in house prices, the more recent study has been updated with quarterly data
spanning 1978-2009.
In their 2005 paper, CQS regress the current change in consumption on the current
change in income, housing and stock wealth (without instrumenting). This causes a potentially
severe endogeneity problem. Aron and Muellbauer (2006) point out that studies of the housing
wealth effect tend to be plagued by “poor controls for common drivers” of both housing wealth
and consumption. One key common driver is permanent income. An increase in expected
permanent income will increase both consumption and demand for homes, and therefore house
prices. Because CQS (2005) do not control for shocks related to permanent income, it is possible
that their results are driven by correlations between permanent income shocks (which should be
the dominant source of housing price changes across time and across states) and housing price
changes. In other words, in states where housing prices are rising, that rise reflects not just past
income growth, but expectations of future income growth, which may produce improvements in
many current market indicators, including rising home values.

9

In CQS (2011), the authors do include regressions that control for omitted
variable/endogeneity bias by instrumenting wealth, following the methodology of Campbell and
Mankiw (1990). The results of the 2011 paper are qualitatively similar to the earlier paper – an
increase in housing wealth is associated with a statistically significant increase in consumption,
and this effect is larger than that of an increase in stock wealth – although the authors now report
a wider range of parameter estimates.
Using the CQS (2005) quarterly data but applying the Campbell and Mankiw (1990)
instrumenting technique, Calomiris, et al. (2009) show that the CQS (2005) wealth effect
estimates are substantially reduced. Thus, the increased size and statistical significance of
housing wealth effects reported in CQS (2011) – in contrast to Calomiris, et al. (2009) – seem to
result from the addition of new data.
While the attempt to measure housing wealth at the state level is a major contribution of
CQS (2005, 2011), the use of quarterly data to measure wealth effects may be problematic. If
consumption takes longer than one quarter to fully respond to a change in housing wealth then
their estimates will be biased, since, in the CQS specification, consumption must respond to a
change in home prices within the same quarter. Even if the regressors were lagged (which they
are not), it is unlikely that the full effect of housing wealth would exert itself upon consumption
in just one quarter. Indeed, Carroll, et al. (2011) estimate housing wealth effects within a habit
formation framework and point out that it could take several years for a change in wealth to fully
exert itself on consumption. Along these lines, Carroll and Zhou (2011) allow for a two year
window to capture the impact of wealth changes on consumer spending. To address this issue,
we employ annual data in our study. Annual data also allow us to avoid excessive interpolation
of stock wealth data (see the Data Appendix for a detailed discussion of this issue), and to
10

employ other data that are only available at annual frequency – i.e., demographic variables that
are likely to matter for the size of housing wealth effects, as discussed above.2
Ours is not the first study to examine the demographic aspects of housing wealth effects.
Campbell and Cocco (2007) employ micro data, and find that older homeowners (those over
forty) exhibit greater wealth effects than those under forty. This finding is consistent with older
homeowners being net long housing due to anticipated downsizing; however, the authors only
divide their age groups into “old” and “young”, making no allowance for middle age. Attanasio,
et al. (2009) divide age groups into three categories: young (under 35), middle-aged (35-60) and
old (over 60). They find that their estimated housing wealth effect is larger for the young than
the old. Since the young are not likely looking to trade down, and are more likely to include
non-homeowners, the authors believe that the estimated wealth effect likely reflects omitted
factors. In particular, consistent with Sinai and Souleles (2005), we would note that young
people are most likely to suffer from credit constraints, and thus the impact of house prices on
the consumption of the young may well represent an effect of home values on consumer
spending.
The results of Campbell and Cocco (2007) and Attanasio, et al. (2009) are promising, and
point to important potential demographic influences. However, both restrict themselves to data
for the United Kingdom. Contreras and Nichols (2010) examine a micro panel data set for the
United States, and include controls for demographics (they include the age of the household head
and its square). They also note that the effect of housing on consumption depends on housing’s
2

We recognize that our own annual contemporaneous modeling of the response of consumption to changes in
income and wealth may not fully capture the long-run response of consumption to these changes. Adding lagged
consumption growth to our panel estimation in the presence of state fixed effects, however, would yield inconsistent
estimates. While there are techniques that yield consistent estimates for dynamic panels with fixed effects, they are
unreliable in small samples like ours. Given that we regard state fixed effects as warranted, we choose to model
only contemporaneous annual responses.

11

proportion of total housing wealth. Dividing the country into nine regions, they find that those
areas with the most cyclical house price changes also typically display the highest housing
wealth, and often exhibit a high estimated elasticity of consumption with respect to home values,
as well as smaller ratios of consumption to housing wealth.
The dependence of the wealth effect on the ratio of housing wealth to total wealth is an
important insight. As discussed in Section I, in a standard PIH model, the impact of housing on
consumption should depend on the relative importance of housing wealth, and on the size of total
wealth (relative to consumption). One of the contributions of our study is the development of a
model that explicitly allows housing and stock wealth effects to vary based on what fraction of
total wealth they comprise.
In summary, the existing literature on consumption responses to changes in housing and
securities wealth has pointed in several promising directions, which we pursue below: (1) panel
estimation of wealth effects (as in CQS) can add statistical power by taking advantage of
variation across states and across time; (2) endogeneity/omitted variable bias is a concern that
can be addressed by instrumenting wealth and income, as in Campbell and Mankiw (1990); (3)
functional forms for estimating housing and securities wealth effects on consumption should take
into account the basic logic of the PIH, which requires that elasticities be allowed to vary with
differences in the relative proportions of housing and securities wealth; and (4) differences
within populations in the proportions of different age groups, and in the distribution of wealth
(the incidence of poverty), are likely to be important in influencing the magnitude of measured
wealth effects.

12

III. Data
In what follows, we provide a brief description of the data used in our analysis; a more
detailed description of our data sources is provided in the Data Appendix. Following CQS
(2005, 2011), we use retail sales as a proxy for consumption, using state-level estimates from
1977Q1 through 2010Q1 provided by Moody’s Economy.com. The underlying data for retail
sales at the state level are nominal, seasonally-adjusted annual rates at a quarterly frequency; our
annual figures are the average of the quarterly SAAR values within each year.
Housing wealth is measured as the average value of owner-occupied housing times the
number of owner-occupants within each state. The average value of owner-occupied housing
each quarter is taken from the Land Prices by State Dataset developed by Davis and Heathcote
(2007) and provided by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; we use 4th quarter figures as the
value for the year. The number of owner-occupied households in each state each year is derived
from the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement to the Current Population Survey
(CPS). A detailed description of how we calculated these estimates is provided in the Data
Appendix. Total nominal housing wealth in each state year is then calculated as the average
value of owner-occupied housing times the number of owner households.
Total U.S. stock wealth is calculated as the sum of corporate equities, mutual fund shares
and pension fund reserves for households and non-profit corporations from the Federal Reserve
Z1 statistical release; we use year-end (4th quarter) values. We allocate that measure of
aggregate annual U.S. stock wealth among states based on the estimated share of mutual fund
holdings across states. Mutual fund share estimates for each state are available only for 1986,
1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2008 and 2009. For years prior to 1986, we used 1986

13

values; values for the remaining missing years of each state’s share in total mutual fund share
percentages (1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996-1999, and 2001-2007) were interpolated linearly.
Estimated nominal stock wealth in each state is then calculated as the aggregate U.S. stock
wealth times each state’s share of aggregate mutual fund holdings.
Other variables used in the analysis include real per-capita personal income from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and annual population estimates by age group and poverty
rates from the U.S. Census. We transform our consumption, income and all three wealth
variables (housing wealth, stock wealth, and total wealth) into real, per-capita values by dividing
by population and deflating using the GDP implicit price deflator. Unless otherwise stated
below, all regressions below are run on log differences of these real, per-capita values.
Our measures of housing and stock wealth differ from those of CQS (2011) in several
ways.3 CQS measure housing wealth using the Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss indices to capture
quarterly changes in house values at the state level. Davis and Heathcote’s measure of housing
wealth uses actual 1980, 1990, and 2000 census figures for the average value of owner-occupied
homes in those years and, as discussed in the Data Appendix, only relies on the FHFA index to
fill in intervening years. 4 In contrast, CQS use only the 2000 census year to benchmark their
housing value estimates. With respect to stock wealth, CQS use a similar approach to ours,

3

In the discussion that follows, we mainly compare our data with CQS (2011). Differences with Carroll and Zhou
(2011) are more substantial and reflect the limited availability of state-level data on securities wealth and
consumption.
4
Both the FHFA and the Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss indices are based on comparisons over time of transactions
involving the same house, in contrast to hedonic pricing models that attempt to control for house characteristics.
These same-sales indexes, however, can suffer from selectivity bias relating to the timing of particular types of
house sales. For example, during the 2007-2009 period, housing sales include a large proportion of distressed home
sales (foreclosures and the like), and observed values of the indexes may provide an exaggerated picture of housing
price decline. Indeed, Leventis (2009) provides evidence that this is the case. One could make a similar argument
that during the subprime housing boom of 2004-2006, transactions gave an unrepresentative and exaggerated picture
of housing price increases.

14

although they lack data for 1995 and 2000 on state-level mutual fund shares, which requires that
they interpolate over the entire period from 1993 to 2008.
Unlike CQS, we rely on annual rather than quarterly data. The sample period is long
enough for annual data to provide reasonably precise estimation of wealth effects, and we regard
annual data as more reliable for several reasons.
First, given the limited number of observations about equity holdings and the consequent
need to interpolate states’ shares of mutual funds, we are less comfortable constructing estimated
quarterly observations for stock wealth. Quarterly interpolation is particularly problematic since
the spotty data on mutual fund shares at the state level are not associated with a particular quarter
within the year. Furthermore, forcing stock holdings to change smoothly over time while
allowing housing wealth to vary quarterly may exaggerate the relative size of housing wealth
effects (especially if the two kinds of wealth are positively correlated). While this problem
remains with our annual data, it should be less pronounced than it is with quarterly interpolation.
Second, the selectivity bias in measuring house prices resulting from using same house
sales as a measure of underlying housing value will be more pronounced with higher-frequency
quarterly data; temporal aggregation should reduce some of the cyclical bias related to the use of
a same-sales housing price index.
Third, the use of annual data avoids having to take a position about the appropriate means
of adjusting for seasonality in personal income and house prices; adjusting for seasonality is
especially challenging given the potential for differences in seasonal patterns across states with
very different age structure and weather patterns.

15

Finally, our population, age composition and poverty estimates are only available at an
annual frequency.

IV. Empirical Analysis
Variation across States and Over Time in Wealth and Population Composition
Table 1 reports summary statistics for the variables used in this study, pooling data across
states and over time. As discussed above, our study emphasizes how variation in age groups,
poverty incidence, and the proportion of wealth in housing, can affect the estimation of
consumption wealth effects for housing and stock. Table 2 shows how our demographic
variables vary across states. The states with the smallest and largest average proportions of
young adults are West Virginia (27.6 percent) and Utah (39.4 percent), respectively. Alaska has
the largest percentage of middle-aged (45.2 percent), while Florida has the lowest percentage
(35.1 percent). Alaska is home to the smallest proportion of old (18.7 percent), while the state
with the highest proportion of old, Florida, had twice that proportion (37.3 percent). Mississippi
has the largest average poverty rate, at 21.2 percent, while New Hampshire’s poverty rate is the
lowest (6.7 percent).
Figures 1A and 1B plot how the age distribution has changed over time for a sample of
eleven states, and for the U.S. as a whole. The percent of the adult population that is “young”
(ages 20-34) is plotted on the x axis, while the percent of the adult population that is “old” (ages
55+) is plotted on the y axis. Clearly, despite the differences in average population composition
across states, states followed a similar within-state pattern over time. The proportion of young
people declined steadily from 1985 to about 2000 while the proportion of old remained roughly

16

constant. After 2000, the proportion of young people was roughly constant, while the proportion
of old people rose steadily. This pattern reflects the effects on population composition of the
post-World War II “baby boom.”
Figure 2 shows the variation in the poverty rate over time for each state. States are
arrayed on the x axis, with each dot representing one year’s value for the poverty rate for that
state. From this figure it is clear that there is as much or more variation in the poverty rate over
time within states as there is across states.
Similarly, Figure 3 plots the ratio of housing wealth to total wealth for each state over
time. As with the poverty rate, this figure shows variation in the average ratio of housing wealth
across states as well as over time within states. For example, Nebraska displays a low average
proportion of housing wealth and a relatively small amount of variation over time in the housing
wealth ratio. Hawaii displays a high average proportion of housing wealth and a relatively small
amount of variation around that mean. Other states – Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia,
for example – have average ratios closer to the national mean and show much greater variation
over time in those ratios.
Figure 4 shows that this variation over time in the proportion of housing wealth follows a
similar pattern across the various states, although some states display more pronounced variation
over time than others. The housing wealth ratio declined from 1985 to 2000, then rose during
the early 2000s, and fell again during the post-2006 subprime crisis.

Calculating Wealth Effects
Our full regression model allows the estimated consumption elasticities of housing and
stock wealth to vary as a function of the relative size of housing and stock wealth. We do this by
including the log difference of total wealth in the model. As we show below, this specification
allows the housing and stock wealth elasticities to vary based on their shares of total wealth. In
addition, our model includes interaction effects between the wealth variables and the
demographic variables. Our full regression specification can be written as:

stock wealth effects and elasticities are calculated analogously.
Notice that in this specification, the consumption elasticities of housing and stock wealth
explicitly depend on the shares of total wealth. To see this, consider a simplified version of the
model that does not include demographic variables. In this case, the consumption elasticity of
housing wealth simplifies to

. In other words, the consumption elasticity of

housing wealth is not constant in this model, but rather depends directly on how large a fraction
of total wealth housing wealth comprises.
In addition to average (sample mean) housing wealth effects and elasticities, we can also
calculate predicted values for each state-year observation:

We hypothesize that all three of these derivatives should be positive. A higher proportion of
young people or people with low wealth should be associated with more binding borrowing
constraints, which should raise the wealth effect. Similarly, a larger proportion of older people
(for whom downsizing of housing consumption is more likely) should also produce a larger
wealth effect. Note that our model specification also implies that
wealth (

) is lower, ceteris paribus (because

is higher when housing

only appears in the denominator of expression

(3) above).
For comparison purposes, we present four additional specifications that do not include all
the effects modeled above. All estimations are specified as log differences to satisfy stationarity
requirements, and follow the Campbell and Mankiw (1990) instrumenting procedure, as in

20

Calomiris, et al. (2009). In addition, all of our regressions control for state fixed effects.5
Presumably, these fixed effects capture average differences across states in expected future
income growth, human capital, and other omitted factors that influence consumption growth
rates. We do not include time effects, since much of the annual variation in wealth (especially in
stock wealth) reflects common factors that affect all the states (e.g., the stock market). Standard
errors are clustered by state. Despite some minor differences, results are quite similar across all
these specifications, as we discuss further below.
In a supplemental appendix, we also report results from OLS log difference regressions,
for comparison purposes.6 We do not report error-correction model results, since the variables in
our model do not appear to be cointegrated, as discussed in the following brief digression.

Is an Error-Correction Model Warranted?
Some authors (e.g., CQS, 2005, 2011) estimate error-correction models of housing wealth
effects. This approach, however, has drawn criticism. Carroll, et al. (2011) argue that changes
in interest or growth rates should change the relationships among other variables (e.g.,
consumption, income and wealth), thus eliminating a stable cointegrating vector among those
variables. If the cointegrating vector is not stable, according to the well-known Granger
representation theorem, an error correction model would not make sense.
We tested for the possibility of cointegration among all four variables in our system
(consumption, income, housing wealth, and stock wealth) by utilizing the panel cointegration test
of Westerlund (2007). A traditional challenge in testing for cointegration is the lack of power in
5

The state fixed effects coefficients for our full specification (Model 5) are reported in Appendix Table A1.
Supplemental appendices can be found at http://realestate.wichita.edu/draft/research/academic_research.asp.

21

traditional methods such as the Johansen-Juselius technique, which posits the null hypothesis as
a lack of cointegration; a lack of power means that one will often conclude that the variables in
question are not cointegrated, when in fact there could be a stationary long-run relationship
among them.
Fortunately, however, we are utilizing a panel dataset. The larger panel dataset increases
the power of the test, just as panel unit root tests increase the power of testing for nonstationarity
in a single series. Some early panel cointegration tests suffered from low power, which arose
from imposing restrictions, such as requiring the long-run parameters to be equal to the short run
responses in differences (see Westerlund 2007), or not allowing for cross-sectional dependence.
Note that allowing for cross-sectional dependence is vital in our study, as there are clearly
common shocks to income, stock and housing wealth across states.
Westerlund (2007) has developed a test for panel cointegration which does not impose
such restrictions and has been demonstrated in simulations to have greater power than existing
panel cointegration tests. By applying this test, we are choosing a technique with a high
probability of finding a cointegrating relationship if one exists.
In particular, the Westerlund technique tests for the significance of the error-correction,
or speed-of-adjustment term. Consider a simple model, where

is a variable and

is a vector of

variables:
Δ
Here

,

Δ

is the error correction term, and

,

,

,

Δ

is the cointegrating vector. Again, by

the Granger representation theorem, if the variables are cointegrated, the model has an error

22

correction representation as shown in the above expression. The Westerlund technique thus tests
for the significance of

; if it is significant, then the variables are cointegrated.

When allowing for a trend, cross-sectional dependence, and differing speed of adjustment
coefficients across the four variables, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis of no
cointegration. Specifically, the Westerlund test statistic was -2.792, implying a p-value of 0.235.
This suggests that it would not be appropriate to model wealth effects using an error-correction
model.

Estimation Results
Table 3 reports our regression results. Model 1 is a traditional specification including
only income, housing wealth and stock wealth. Model 2 includes total wealth, allowing housing
and stock wealth elasticities to vary based on their proportions of total wealth. Model 3 adds age
and poverty demographics to the model but does not allow elasticities to vary with wealth shares.
Model 4 includes age demographics and wealth shares effects, while Model 5 is the full
specification including age demographics, the poverty rate and wealth shares effects.
Based on the regression results reported in Table 3, Table 4 shows, for each of the five
models, the implied average housing wealth effects (HWE), average stock wealth effects (SWE),
average elasticities of consumption with respect to housing and stock wealth, and the derivatives
of HWE and SWE with respect to age composition and poverty rates. Recall that HWE and
SWE measure the effects on consumption of a $1 increase in either housing wealth or stock
wealth. Using Model 5, a $1 increase in housing wealth raises contemporaneous consumption by
roughly $0.08 on average. In contrast, the effect of a $1 increase in stock wealth on consumption

23

is nil (although in the non-preferred specifications of Models 1-3, the average stock wealth effect
is just less than $0.02).
As hypothesized above, in our preferred Model 5 the implied derivatives of HWE with
respect to ,

and

are all positive. That is, higher proportions of young people and old

people, and a higher poverty rate all act to raise the housing wealth effect for a state-year. In
contrast, the estimated derivatives of SWE with respect to

and

are negative. It is worth

noting, however, that the overall stock wealth effect is insignificantly different from zero,
making the implied derivatives less relevant. The insignificant estimated SWE reflects the
offsetting influences of seven statistically significant coefficients from Model 5 in Table 3. In
other words, the net effect of combining several statistically significant influences is an overall
stock wealth effect that is not measurably different from zero.
Figure 5 plots the pattern of average estimated wealth effects over time (averaging across
states within each year) for our various specifications, with confidence intervals estimated under
the restrictive assumption that within-year covariances of HWEs and SWEs across states are
zero.7 In Models 4 and 5, which include both age demographics and wealth ratios, stock wealth
effects are relatively high during the stock market boom of the 1990s, when the proportion of
stock wealth was relatively high; housing wealth effects fell sharply during this period. Over
time, however, average housing wealth effects have generally been declining. The differences in
the implied time variation of wealth effects for the different model specifications has interesting
implications for understanding the factors that drive variation in housing and stock wealth effects

7

In principle, each of the state’s HWE and SWE observations in a given year has an error component, but this can
only be calculated for a given assumption of the covariances among the states’ HWEs (or SWEs) within each year.
By making a particular assumption – here, that covariance is zero – we are able to calculate the standard error in
each year. If one assumed positive covariances among states, confidence bands would widen accordingly.

24

across different time periods. Models 2 and 3, which take into account only age variation or
wealth composition (but not both simultaneously, as in Models 4 and 5), exhibit much smaller
swings in wealth effects over time. Demographic and wealth compositional effects, therefore,
obviously are correlated, since Model 5’s time path is not a simple aggregation of the influences
of Models 2 and 3 (wealth ratios and demographics). In addition to plotting Figure 5 based on
simple averages across states, we also examined alternative versions of Figure 5 (available in a
supplemental appendix) which weigh states by consumption, total wealth, or population; all of
these versions of Figure 5 appear virtually identical to the non-weighted version reported here.
As hypothesized, poverty rate interactions are statistically significant and the derivative
of the housing wealth effect with respect to poverty is positive (Table 4). We interpret this as
evidence that states with higher poverty also tend to experience more binding borrowing
constraints on permanent income, which tends to strengthen the housing wealth effect. Figure 5
shows that the inclusion of poverty rates does not materially affect the patterns of time variation
in the size of the two wealth effects once age effects are included, although it does increase the
magnitude of the average estimated housing wealth effect. In other words, the time patterns of
the wealth effects are qualitatively similar across Model 4 (without poverty rates) and Model 5
(with poverty rates).
Figure 6 is plotted under our full specification, and shows the extent of variation within
each state over time in the implied housing and stock wealth effects. Stock wealth effects vary
less across states than do housing wealth effects.
The inclusion of poverty rates affects the correlations between wealth effects and total
wealth. The top part of Figure 7 plots the relationship between total wealth and the housing and
stock wealth effects under the Model 4 specification (which does not include poverty rates). As

25

implied by our specifications, both of the estimated wealth effects decline as a function of
wealth. When poverty is included in the model, however, (as shown in the bottom half of Figure
7) the association between estimated housing wealth elasticities and total wealth becomes more
pronounced, while the association between estimated stock wealth elasticities and wealth
becomes less pronounced. This reflects the fact that the inclusion of poverty rates in the
specification (which are strongly negatively correlated with real, per capita total wealth)
increases the housing wealth effect for states with higher poverty rates. Table 5 provides statelevel averages (sorted by the size of the housing wealth effect) of the housing wealth effect, the
stock wealth effect, and the key variables that determine the size of these effects, as calculated in
expression (1) above.
In results not reported here, we explored whether the unemployment rate might serve as a
better measure of wealth distribution than the poverty rate. That is, we re-ran the specifications
reported in Table 3 using unemployment instead of poverty for the regressions in columns (3)
and (5). Coefficients on unemployment interactions with wealth measures were less statistically
significant. The results for HWE and SWE reported in Table 4, as well as the wealth elasticities
and wealth effect derivatives reported in Table 4, were quite similar. Overall, we concluded
from this analysis that unemployment is a somewhat noisier proxy than poverty rates for the
distribution of wealth.

26

Why Are Stock Wealth Effects Relatively Small?
We consistently find that stock wealth effects, elasticities, and wealth effect derivatives
are small relative to comparable effects relating to housing wealth.8 This finding is puzzling,
given that, in theory – as developed by Buiter (2007) and Sinai and Souleles (2005) – stock
wealth effects should be larger than housing wealth effects. We can think of two possible
explanations for our findings: the relatively high volatility of stock wealth, and the relatively low
proportion of the population that owns stock.
First, it may be that the higher volatility of stock wealth causes small short-run (one-year)
responses of consumption to increases in stock wealth. If consumption decisions are costly to
reverse (e.g., if there are costs of liquidating consumer durables, “habit formation” effects, etc.)
then consumers will respond less to volatile changes in wealth. Indeed, several papers have
found that consumers’ short-run responses to stock wealth are much lower than their long-run
responses (see the discussion in Parker 2001).
As shown in Table 6, on average, the coefficient of variation for housing wealth is
generally lower than that of stock wealth. Furthermore, for the vast majority of states, stock
wealth is much more volatile than housing wealth. There are eleven states for which the
coefficient of variation is higher for housing wealth than for stock wealth, but in six of those
eleven cases, the housing wealth coefficient of variation is no more than 11% higher than the
stock wealth coefficient of variation. Among the five cases where housing wealth is
substantially more volatile than stock wealth (Delaware, New Jersey, District of Columbia,

8

Note that our finding of a larger wealth effect for housing compared to equities is consistent with previous studies
for the U.S. For instance, in nearly all specifications of CQS (2005), the housing wealth effect exceeds the stock
wealth effect. CQS (2011) update their study and similarly find small stock wealth effects compared to the imapct
of housing wealth. Carroll et al. (2011) find much larger housing than stock wealth effects, and Carroll and Zhou
(2011) find a positive impact of housing wealth on consumption, but no significant impact of stocks.

27

Florida, and Oregon), two of those cases (DE and DC) exhibit housing volatility more than twice
as high as stock wealth volatility. In 40 of 51 cases, stock wealth is more volatile than housing
wealth. In four of those 40 cases stock wealth volatility is no more than 11% higher, but in 36 of
the 40 cases, it is substantially more volatile, and in 15 cases, stock wealth is more than twice as
volatile as housing wealth. In summary, in ten of 51 “states” (including DC), housing wealth
and stock wealth are similarly volatile; in five states housing wealth is substantially more volatile
than stock wealth; and in the remaining 36 states, stock wealth is substantially more volatile than
housing wealth. Furthermore, in only two states is housing wealth more than twice as volatile as
stock wealth; but in 15 states stock wealth is more than twice as volatile as housing wealth.
A second explanation for the low response of consumption to stock wealth could be
aggregation bias. If there are fixed costs to holding stocks (e.g., the cost of becoming familiar
with stock market investments and the process of establishing brokerage accounts), then many
people may simply not participate at all in the stock market. In that case, the estimated stock
wealth response for a state-year observation will be substantially downward biased, since the
aggregate response reflects the behavior of only a portion of the population.
While virtually everyone lives in a home, and roughly two-thirds of Americans owned
their primary residence during our sample period, as shown in Table 7, only 15-21 percent of
Americans (depending on the year) owned stocks, and only 10-18 percent owned pooled
investment funds.
Although it is beyond the scope of this paper, future empirical work using householdlevel data could distinguish between these two competing hypotheses – volatility differences of
wealth and aggregation bias – to estimate their relative importance in explaining the relatively
low marginal propensity to consume from stock wealth. Nevertheless, for the purposes of our

28

study, it is relevant to note that both views are plausible, given the much greater volatility of
stock wealth for most states and the much lower household participation rate in the stock market.

V. Conclusion
Economic theory has several important implications for the empirical modeling of
consumption wealth effects: (1) The composition of wealth (the relative proportions of housing
and stock wealth) should matter for the estimation of wealth effects on consumption associated
with changes in either type of wealth; (2) age characteristics of the population should matter for
estimation of housing wealth effects, either because of anticipated downsizing of housing by
older residents, or because younger residents tend to face more binding constraints on borrowing
against permanent income; (3) the proportion of low-wealth individuals may matter for wealth
effects through its effect on the extent to which residents are likely to face binding borrowing
constraints against permanent income; and (4) permanent income and wealth variation are likely
correlated, which means that estimates of wealth effects may suffer from endogeneity/omitted
variable bias.
This paper assembles new annual data on state-level housing wealth, stock wealth, and
other variables for the period 1981 to 2009 in order to address each of these theoretical ideas. In
contrast to Calomiris, et al. (2009) – which was based on less-reliable data – we find evidence of
a large average housing wealth effect during our sample period. Consistent with theory, housing
wealth effects vary dramatically over time and across states, reflecting variation in the proportion
of housing wealth, variation in age composition associated with varying state-level experiences
during the baby boom, and variation in the incidence of poverty. Stock wealth effects, on

29

average, are much smaller than housing wealth effects, and they also vary over time and across
states. These estimates show the importance of taking account of wealth composition, age
composition, and wealth distribution when estimating housing and stock wealth effects. Wealth
effects going forward, therefore, are likely to be very different from those of the past, as they will
be contingent on a variety of demographic and economic characteristics that will change over
time.
One advantage of our state-level aggregate analysis is that our specification may be
useful to macroeconomic forecasters to gauge the time variation in wealth effects. The most
important inputs on which we rely for our estimation – annual state-level data on the age of the
population, the poverty rate, and the amount of housing wealth – are generally available with
short lags, and therefore, could be used to update housing wealth effect forecasts annually. Given
the amount of variation over time in wealth effects, this could be a useful forecasting tool.
Our finding that stock wealth effects are small and not highly statistically significant is at
odds with some theoretical models. In the models developed by Buiter (2007) and Sinai and
Souleles (2005), stock wealth effects, in general, should be larger than housing wealth effects,
notwithstanding the greater usefulness of housing wealth as collateral for borrowing against
permanent income. It is worth noting that Carroll and Zhou (2011) – who employ better quality
data on stock wealth for a shorter time period – also find a negligible stock wealth effect as did
Carroll, et al. (2011), and Case, et al. (2005, 2011). We conjecture that the greater volatility of
stock wealth and the lower rate of participation by households in the stock market can explain
the relatively muted response of consumption to changes in stock market wealth.

Notes: Standard errors (clustered by state) are shown in parentheses below the estimates. The Wald Chi-square
statistic tests for the joint significance of all of the coefficients except the constant term.
*** Coefficient significant at the 1% level.
** Coefficient significant at the 5% level.
* Coefficient significant at the 10% level.
The dependent variable is log difference of real, per capita consumption (where consumption is proxied by
state-level retail sales). Wealth variables are expressed in log differences of real, per capita values. Young
Percent is the percent of the adult population ages 20-34; Old Percent is the percentage of the adult population
ages 55 and up; Poverty is the poverty rate.
All wealth and interaction variables are instrumented using the 2nd-4th lags of these variables.

Housing and stock wealth effects are expressed in dollar terms and calculated at the sample mean values for all
variables. Housing and stock wealth elasticities and wealth effect derivatives are calculated at sample means
for all variables as well.

Notes: Cell entries are averages of the variable over the years 1985-2009; the years 1981-1984 are excluded from the analysis
because of lags used for instrumenting. Note that the average housing and stock wealth effects over the entire sample are
not the same as the housing and stock wealth effects calculated at the sample means of the variables, and thus the totals
presented in this table correctly differ from the values shown in Table 4.
Variables are defined as follows:
HWE = Average housing wealth effect
SWE = Average stock wealth effect
Cons. / HW = Average consumption-to-housing wealth ratio
Cons. / SW = Average consumption-to-stock wealth ratio

Notes: The time path of the average housing and stock wealth effects are shown for each of the five
models presented in Table 3 (each year’s value is the average across states). Model 1 is a traditional
constant elasticity framework. Model 2 allows housing and stock wealth elasticities to vary based on
the composition of total wealth. Model 3 includes demographic effects (age and poverty rates) but not
wealth compositions. Model 4 includes both age demographics and wealth compositions but not
poverty rates. Model 5 includes all demographic wealth composition effects; 95 percent error bands
are calculated assuming zero cross-state correlation among wealth effects within a given year.

Notes: Figure shows the relationship between each state’s average housing and stock wealth effects
and average total wealth within that state (averaged across over the years of the analysis, 1985-2009,
within each state). Panel A calculates the average housing and stock wealth effects using the
parameter estimates from Model 4, which does not include the poverty rate. Panel B calculates the
wealth effects using the parameter estimates from Model 5 (the full specification).

Data Appendix
Consumption: Real, per-capita retail sales
State-level retail sales data from 1977Q1 through 2010Q1 were provided by Moody’s
Economy.com. The underlying data are nominal, seasonally-adjusted annual rates at a quarterly
frequency. Nominal annual retail sales are the average of the quarterly figures within each year.
Housing Wealth: Real, per-capita value of owner-occupied housing
Housing wealth is measured as the average value of owner-occupied housing times the
number of owner-occupants within each state. The average value of owner-occupied housing
each quarter is taken from the Land Prices by State Dataset developed by Davis and Heathcote
(2007) and provided by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; we use 4th quarter figures as the
value for the year in our annual data.9 We use the 2011Q1 release of these data.
The number of owner-occupied households in each state-year is derived from the Annual
Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) using the
March micro data provided by the National Bureau for Economic Research.10 Using the
household data in each year, the H_TENURE variable is tabulated by state using MARSUPWT
(the March Supplement, or household sampling weight) to get an estimate of the number of
owner-occupied, renter-occupied and total households by state. These estimates are smoothed by

These data are updated quarterly and can be found a “Land and Property Values in the U.S.”, Lincoln Institute of
Land Policy, http://www.lincolninst.edu/resources/. According to the Lincoln Institute website, this figure is
estimated in two steps. “First, the average value for each state is estimated in 1980, 1990, and 2000 using micro
data from the Decennial Census of Housing (DCH). Then the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) quarterly
repeat-sales (constant quality) house price indexes for each state are used to scale the home value series by quarter
between 1980 and 2000 and to extend the home value series back from 1980 to 1975 and forward from 2000 to the
most recent quarter. The growth rates of the reported FHFA indexes are adjusted so that their growth between 19801990 and 1990-2000 match the decennial growth of average house values from the DCH data. The 1980-1990
growth-rate adjustments are applied to the pre-1980 FHFA data and the 1990-2000 growth-rate adjustments are
applied to the post-2000 FHFA data.”

taking the three-year (forward and lagging) moving average, in order to minimize noise induced
by changes in the sampling weights over time.11
Total nominal housing wealth for each state-year observation is simply the number of
owner households times the average value of owner-occupied housing.
Stock Wealth: Real, per-capita financial assets
Total U.S. stock wealth is calculated as the sum of corporate equities, mutual fund shares
and pension fund reserves for households and non-profit corporations from the Federal Reserve
Flow of Funds (FoF) Z1 statistical release, Table L100, 2011Q1 release; annual data are year-end
(4th quarter) values.
Aggregate U.S. stock wealth is allocated across states based on the distribution of mutual
fund holdings across states. CQS (2005) use data on mutual fund holdings by state obtained
from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) as a proxy for the fraction of aggregate financial
wealth held in each state in the years 1986, 1987, 1989, 1991 and 1993. Since the publiclyavailable CQS (2005) data do not contain the underlying ICI mutual fund allocations, each
state’s implied percent of aggregate U.S. financial wealth was calculated using the CQS (2005)
Nominal Stock Market Wealth variable in each quarter.12 The percent of financial wealth held
by each state in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1991 and 1993 was then assumed to be the 1st quarter values
in these years.13
Additional years’ estimates of the distribution of mutual fund assets by state were
provided directly by ICI. For 1995, the figure is based on the same mutual fund company
information used in CQS (2005); 2000, 2008 and 2009 figures are based on household survey
11

The estimated coefficients in Table 3 are qualitatively similar using the raw estimates of the number of owneroccupied households instead of the three-year moving averages.

CQS (2005) interpolated quarterly values between these years, and analysis of the data revealed that 1st quarter
values were the break points in the interpolation.

results. For years prior to 1986, we used the 1986 value; values for the remaining missing years
were interpolated linearly.
Nominal stock wealth is then aggregate U.S. financial wealth times the mutual fund
percent for each state-year.
Total Wealth: Real, per-capita financial assets + real, per-capital housing wealth
Total real, per-capita wealth is the sum of real, per-capita housing wealth and real, percapita stock wealth.
Income: Real, per-capita personal income by state
Annual and quarterly data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2011Q1 release).
Population
Mid-year population estimates of the Census Bureau, provided in the annual personal
income summary by state from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Intercensal population estimates
for the 2000’s were not yet available at the time of this draft, so population estimates for 20012009 are based on postcensal estimates obtained directly from the Bureau of the Census;14 while
the 2010 figure is from the 2010 census.
Demographic (Age Range and Poverty) Data
Estimated population counts by age group for 1970-2009 were obtained from the Centers
for Disease Control CDC WONDER on-line database.15 The Young adult population ratio is the

adult population ages 35-54; and the Old adult population ratio is the percent of adult population
ages 55 and up.
Poverty rates for each state-year were found in Historical Poverty Table 21, Number of
Poor and Poverty Rate, by State, on the Bureau of the Census website.16 According to notes in
this table, the figures are estimated by the Bureau of the Census using the Annual Social and
Economic (ASEC) Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS).
GDP Deflator
All real values are calculated using the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator
(Index 2005=100). Data were obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Federal
Reserve Economic Data (FRED) service (Series ID: GDPDEF; 2011Q1 release).17 Fourth
quarter values are used as the annual figure of the index.
