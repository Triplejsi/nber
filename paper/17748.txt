ABSTRACT
We implement an empirical test for selection into health insurance using changes in coverage induced
by the introduction of mandated health insurance in Massachusetts. Our test examines changes in the
cost of the newly insured relative to those who were insured prior to the reform. We find that counties
with larger increases in insurance coverage over the reform period face the smallest increase in average
hospital costs for the insured population, consistent with adverse selection into insurance before the
reform. Additional results, incorporating cross-state variation and data on health measures, provide
further evidence for adverse selection.

Health Reform, Health Insurance, and Selection: Estimating
Selection into Health Insurance Using the Massachusetts
Health Reform
Martin B. Hackmann, Jonathan T. Kolstad, and Amanda E. Kowalski∗

Abstract: We implement an empirical test
for selection into health insurance using changes
in coverage induced by the introduction of mandated health insurance in Massachusetts. Our
test examines changes in the cost of the newly
insured relative to those who were insured prior
to the reform. We find that counties with larger
increases in insurance coverage over the reform
period face the smallest increase in average hospital costs for the insured population, consistent
with adverse selection into insurance before the
reform. Additional results, incorporating crossstate variation and data on health measures, provide further evidence for adverse selection.

Asymmetric information can distort available insurance contracts, as in Rothschild and Stiglitz
(1976), or it can raise premiums for the relatively
healthy, as in Akerlof (1970). Both distortions
result in inefficiently low levels of insurance coverage.

Approximately 49.9 million people in the United
States lack health insurance (DeNavas-Walt,
Proctor and Smith (2011)). One potential driver
of uninsurance is asymmetric information on
health risk between insurers and the insured.

Predicated, at least in part, on concerns about
adverse selection, the state of Massachusetts
passed health reform in April 2006 aimed at
achieving near-universal health insurance coverage. The Massachusetts approach is considered
a model for national health reform, the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),
signed in March 2010. A central feature of
both reforms is a mandate that individuals obtain health insurance or pay a penalty. The
Massachusetts mandate allows us to examine
whether there was adverse selection into health
insurance before the reform. In contrast, existing
literature generally examines adverse selection
among employer-sponsored plans (e.g. Cutler
and Reber (1998); Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen
(2010)), which is less relevant for policy.

Our simple empirical methodology is based on
the observation that the direction of selection depends on the difference between the cost of the
marginal enrollee and the cost of those who already have insurance. If the cost of the marginal
enrollee is below the average cost of those who
are already insured, selection is adverse; if the
cost of the marginal enrollee is above the average
cost of those who are already insured, selection

universe of hospital costs in Massachusetts, and
hospital costs account for the majority of medical spending.
To understand the mechanisms behind our
cost results, we examine health measures and
behaviors. We estimate variants of equation
(1) where Y represents measures of the average
health of the insured. Depending on the correlation between the health measures and cost, the
sign of α is a test for selection. If there is adverse selection, we expect the rate of diabetes (a
health measure that should be positively correlated with costs) to decline in the insured population. In contrast, we expect the rate of regular exercise (a measure that should be negatively

Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010), the sign
of the slope of the average cost curve captures
selection.
We use the Massachusetts reform to provide
an exogenous shift in coverage that identifies the
slope of the average cost curve. We find that
counties with larger increases in coverage over
the reform period face the smallest increase in
average hospital costs for the insured population,
consistent with adverse selection into insurance
before reform. Additional results that incorporate cross-state variation and data on health
measures provide further evidence for adverse selection.

captures insurance coverage. δt and µc control
for fixed effects by year and county. We estimate equation (1) via TSLS where the set of instruments is given by the interaction of a postreform indicator and county fixed effects, such
that county-specific changes in coverage over the
reform period are the only source of identifying
variation.
Under adverse selection, we expect α < 0: an
increase in insurance coverage improves the pool
of the insured risks and decreases the average
costs per insuree. Conversely, under advantageous selection, the average cost of the insured
grows as the pool expands: α > 0. Our primary specification focuses on hospital cost as the
dependent variable because asymmetric informa-

which we convert to costs using the HCUP costto-charge ratio. We prefer costs to charges because charges reflect prices, and hospitals might
have changed their prices following reform. We

Conclusion

Our results suggest that increased coverage due
to reform in Massachusetts lowered average hospital costs for the insured, and thus average
premiums before loading, by about $124. This
impact, which represents an average premium
change over all types of insurance, is consistent
with the aggregate change in premiums in Massachusetts. Between 2006 and 2009, premiums in
employer-sponsored plans followed the national
trend, but premiums in the non-group market
decreased by 20% (Gruber (2011)), comparable
to the 3% overall decrease in premiums that we
observe.
Our results also shed light on an important
question for insurers and policy makers facing
the introduction of the PPACA: who is likely to
sign up for coverage, particularly through new
health insurance exchanges? However, to generalize our results from the Massachusetts to
the national reform, we should note that Massachusetts had “community rating” regulations
that limited the ability of insurers to price based
on health status in the non-group health insurance market before the reform. These regulations could have increased asymmetric information, leading to adverse selection and higher premiums. In contrast, much of the country does
not currently have community rating regulations
in place, but the PPACA institutes them along
with the individual mandate.

Despite differences in the community rating
environments between Massachusetts and the
nation, our findings are broadly consistent with
the CBO predictions for national reform: premium changes from -1 to 2% in the small group
market and from -3 to 0% in the large group
market (CBO 2009). Comparison with the CBO
estimates suggests that community rating in the
non-group market does not drive our results, unsurprising given that only 5% of the insured in
Massachusetts were in the non-group market before reform and the share was unchanged after
reform (Kolstad and Kowalski (2010)).
The existence of community rating prior to reform also makes the Massachusetts experience
relevant in the case that the Supreme Court finds
the individual mandate unconstitutional but upholds the community rating regulations. Our results suggest that a partial implementation of
PPACA would reduce pooling, leading premiums
to fall by less than they otherwise would or even
increase.
We have demonstrated that there was adverse
selection into health insurance in Massachusetts
before the reform. While this allows us to address some policy relevant questions, our simple sign test does not quantify the magnitude of
the welfare cost of adverse selection. In ongoing
work we extend this approach to estimate welfare
losses due to adverse selection.
