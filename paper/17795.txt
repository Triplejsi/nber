ABSTRACT
We explore the impact of investment-specific technology (IST) shocks on the crosssection of stock
returns. IST shocks reflect technological advances embodied in new capital goods. Using a structural
model, we show that IST shocks have a differential effect on the two fundamental components of firm
value, the value of assets in place and the value of growth opportunities. This differential sensitivity
to IST shocks has two main implications. First, risk premia on firms with abundant growth opportunities
are different from those on firms with limited growth opportunities. Second, firms with similar levels
of growth opportunities comove with each other, giving rise to the value factor in stock returns. Our
model replicates the failure of the conditional CAPM to capture the value premium. Our empirical
tests confirm the model's predictions for asset returns and investment rates.

Introduction
Technological innovation is a key determinant of economic growth. In many cases, technological innovations affect aggregate output and consumption only to the extent that
they are implemented through the formation of new capital stock. Such innovations are
termed investment-specific, since they are embodied in new capital goods. The magnitude of
investment-specific technical progress can be inferred from the decline in the quality-adjusted
price of investment goods.1 The recent literature on real determinants of economic growth
has emphasized the role of investment-specific shocks as an important driver of long-run
growth and business cycle fluctuations. In this paper, we argue that investment-specific
(IST) shocks are helpful in understanding the patterns of risk premia and comovement in
the cross-section of firms.
We start with the standard decomposition of firm value into the value of assets in place
and the value of growth opportunities. Firms that are relatively rich in growth opportunities
have higher demand for new capital goods. As a result, a positive IST shock, manifesting as
a reduction in the quality-adjusted price of new capital goods, has a larger positive impact
on the market value of such firms. This mechanism produces two important patterns in
asset returns. First, firms with a higher ratio of growth opportunities to their market value
(high-growth firms) earn different risk premia from firms with fewer growth opportunities
(low-growth firms). Second, returns on high-growth firms comove with each other, which
creates a systematic factor in stock returns distinct from the market portfolio. Both of these
patterns replicate the well-documented properties of value and growth stocks (e.g., Fama and
1

A classic example of investment-specific technological change is computers. In 2011, a typical computer
server costs $5,000. In 1960, a state of the art computer server (e.g., the Burroughs 205), cost $5.1 million
in 2011 dollars. Furthermore, adjusting for quality is important: a modern computer server would cost
$160.8 million in 1960, using the quality-adjusted NIPA deflator for computers and software. Greenwood
(1999) offers numerous additional examples of investment-specific technological change since the industrial
revolution: Watt’s steam engine, Crompton’s spinning mule, and the dynamo. These innovations were
embodied in new vintages of capital goods, hence they required substantial new investments before they
could affect the production of consumption goods.

French (1993)), because in our model firms’ market-to-book ratios are positively correlated
with their growth opportunities.
The premise that IST shocks affect assets in place and growth opportunities differently is
at the heart of our argument, and distinguishes our theory from other proposed explanations
of return comovement and the value premium in stock returns. We test two main implications
of this core mechanism. First, a firm’s stock return exposure to IST shocks is increasing in
the share of growth opportunities in firm value. Second, since firms must invest to realize
their growth opportunities, high-growth firms increase investment relatively more following
a positive IST shock. Since growth opportunities are not directly observable, we test these
implications jointly using the firm’s stock return beta on the IST shock as a measure of
its growth opportunities. As an alternative strategy, we test both predictions using the
market-to-book ratio as an approximate measure of growth opportunities.
Firms’ growth opportunities change over time, thus we need to estimate time-varying
stock return sensitivities to IST shocks. The macroeconomic literature typically measures
IST shocks using the quality-adjusted price of equipment. However, this price series is
available only at low frequencies. Our model suggests a natural mimicking portfolio for IST
shocks: the difference between stock returns of investment-good producers and consumptiongood producers (IMC). The key benefit of this stock-return based measure of IST shocks
is that it is available at high frequency. In our tests, we use the IMC portfolio to estimate
the conditional stock return betas with respect to the IST shocks. We find that firms with
high IST betas tend to have higher Tobin’s Q, have higher investment rates in physical
capital, hold more cash, pay less in dividends, and invest more in R&D. The tests of the
model’s mechanism show that, following a positive IST shock, firms with higher IST betas
increase their investment relative to firms with low IST betas. The same pattern holds
for high and low book-to-market firms. This pattern is both statistically and economically
significant. The difference in IST shock sensitivity between the investment of high-growth
and low-growth firms is in most cases substantially larger than the sensitivity of investment
2

of an average firm. These results show that cross-sectional differences in IST risk exposures
are linked to differences in growth opportunities among firms.
Sorting firms on their IST betas results in a declining profile of average stock returns
and an increasing profile of market betas. Hence, the CAPM significantly misprices these
portfolios. The difference in average annualized returns and CAPM alphas between the high
and low IST-beta decile portfolios is −3.2% and −7.1% respectively. This finding implies
that IST shocks are a systematic risk factor that carries a negative risk premium. In addition,
we find that firms with higher market-to-book ratios are more exposed to IST shocks. This
confirms that heterogeneous exposure to IST shocks generates co-movement among stocks
with similar book-to-market ratios.
Our model replicates the dispersion in risk premia and comovement associated with
differences in growth opportunities, and the failure of the CAPM to price the cross-section
of expected returns. The model generates lower average returns for high IMC-beta and high
market-to-book firms, assuming a negative price of risk for IST shocks. We verify that our
calibration is consistent with the data by estimating the stochastic discount factor implied
by the model using three different cross-sections of assets: portfolios of firms sorted on IMCbeta, book-to-market portfolios, and industry portfolios. We find that a higher exposure to
IST shocks is associated with lower risk premia, across the discount factor specifications and
test assets. Furthermore, differences in IST shock exposure account for a significant fraction
of the heterogenity in risk premia among the test assets.
Our model also replicates the dynamics of cash flows and profitability of value and growth
firms documented by Fama and French (1995). In the year of portfolio formation, growth
firms have higher average profitability than value firms. In the years following portfolio
formation, the average profitability of growth firms declines, whereas the average profitability
of value firms rises. Despite the fall in average profitability, the earnings of growth firms
grow faster than the earnings of value firms. In the model, this pattern of mean reversion in

3

profitability is driven partly by the fact that growth firms invest relatively more on average.
As growth firms accumulate capital, they become similar to value firms.
In summary, our analysis highlights that IST shocks are an important source of systematic
risk. IST shocks naturally lead to patterns of stock return comovement among firms with
different growth opportunities, and thus give rise to the value factor. Heterogenous exposure
to IST shocks is an important source of cross-sectional heterogeneity in risk premia. Our
mechanism has a number of implications for stock returns and firm investment behavior,
which we confirm empirically. We verify that a parsimonious structural model is able to
account for several key empirical patterns quantitatively, providing additional support for
our theory.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we relate our work to the
existing literature. In Section 2 we develop our theoretical model. In Section 3, we discuss
the data construction and the calibration of our model. In Section 4 we test its empirical
predictions. We conclude in Section 5.

Related Research

Our paper bridges and complements two distinct strands of the finance and macroeconomic
literature. The first argues for the importance of investment-specific shocks for aggregate
growth and fluctuations, and the second argues that differences in a firm’s mix between
growth opportunities and assets in place are important for understanding the cross-section
of expected stock returns.
Investment-specific (IST) shocks capture the idea that technical change is embodied in
new equipment. Starting with Solow (1960), a number of economists have proposed embodied
technical change as an alternative to the unrealistic disembodied technology shocks in most
macroeconomic models.2 Cummins and Violante (2002) document significant instances of
2

Solow (1960, p 91) is sceptical of disembodied technology shocks: “...This conflicts with the casual
observation that many, if not most, innovations need to be embodied in new kinds of durable equipment

4

investment-specific technical change in numerous industries. In macroeconomics, a number of
studies have shown that IST shocks can account for a large fraction of the variability of output
and employment, both in the long run and at business cycle frequencies (e.g., Greenwood,
Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997, 2000); Christiano and Fisher (2003); Fisher (2006); Justiniano,
Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2010)). Given that IST advances lead to improvements in the
real investment opportunity set in the economy, they naturally have a differential impact on
growth opportunities of firms and their assets in place. Papanikolaou (2011) demonstrates
that in a general equilibrium model, IST shocks are positively correlated with the stochastic
discount factor under plausible preference specifications, implying a negative price of risk for
IST shocks.
In financial economics, the idea that growth opportunities may have different risk characteristics than assets in place is not new (e.g., Berk, Green, and Naik (1999); Gomes, Kogan,
and Zhang (2003); Carlson, Fisher, and Giammarino (2004); Zhang (2005)). In these studies,
assets in place and growth opportunities have different exposures to systematic risk, which
is summarized by firms’ market betas. Our work complements this literature by illustrating
how investment-specific shocks affect both the differences in risk premia and return comovement between assets in place and growth opportunities. Most of the existing models focus
on the risk premia but not on return comovement, and thus feature a single aggregate shock.
In models with a single systematic shock, risk premia of firms are closely aligned with their
conditional market betas. As a result, such models have limited ability to account for the
empirical failures of the conditional CAPM (e.g. Lewellen and Nagel (2006)). The model
of Berk et al. (1999) is one of the few exceptions, it incorporates shocks to both aggregate
productivity and discount rates.
Our work is also connected to the literature relating asset prices and firm investment. In
this literature, Tobin’s Q is commonly used as a stock-market based predictor of investment
before they can be made effective. Improvements in technology affect output only to the extent that they
are carried into practice either by net capital formation or by the replacement of old-fashioned equipment
by the latest models...”

5

(e.g., Hayashi (1982); Abel (1985); Abel and Eberly (1994, 1996, 1998); Eberly, Rebelo, and
Vincent (2008)). Tobin’s Q measures the valuation of capital installed in the firm relative
to its replacement cost. Thus, Tobin’s Q is commonly considered an observable proxy for
growth opportunities. We use an alternative empirical measure of growth opportunities that
is a unique implication of our model, that is, the stock return beta with respect to IST shocks.
Our tests demonstrate that our measure is incrementally informative when controlling for
Tobin’s Q and other standard empirical predictors of investment.
A growing branch of asset pricing literature in finance relates Q-based theories of investment to stock return behavior (e.g., Cochrane (1991, 1996); Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang
(2008); Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009); Li, Livdan, and Zhang (2009); Chen, Novy-Marx,
and Zhang (2010); Li and Zhang (2010)). This literature focuses on the relation between
expected stock returns and firms’ investment decisions, which follows from firms’ optimizing
behavior. Our focus is instead on the mechanism behind the joint determination of investment behavior and risk premia. Thus, our work complements the existing studies and offers a
potentially fruitful way of improving our understanding of the links between real investment
and stock returns.

The Model

In this section we develop a structural model of investment. We show that the value of assets
in place and the value of growth opportunities have different sensitivity to IST shocks. As
a result, the relative weight of growth opportunities in a firm’s value can be identified by
measuring the exposure of its stock returns to IST shocks.
There are two sectors in our model: the consumption-good sector, and the investmentgood sector. IST shocks manifest as changes in the cost of new capital goods. We focus on
heterogeneity in growth opportunities among consumption-good producers.

6

2.1

Consumption-Good Producers

There is a continuum of measure one of infinitely-lived firms producing a homogeneous
consumption good. Firms behave competitively, and there is no explicit entry or exit in this
sector. Firms are financed only by equity, hence the firm value is equal to the market value
of its equity.
Assets in Place
Each firm owns a finite number of individual projects. Firms create projects over time
through investment, and projects expire randomly.3 Let F denote the set of firms and Jtf
the set of projects owned by firm f at time t.
Project j managed by firm f produces a flow of output equal to
yf jt = εf t ujt xt Kjα ,

(1)

where Kj is physical capital chosen irreversibly at project j’s inception date, ujt is the projectspecific component of productivity, εf t is the firm-specific component of productivity, such
as managerial skill of the parent firm, and xt a disembodied productivity shock affecting the
output of all existing projects. We assume decreasing returns to scale at the project level,
α ∈ (0, 1). Projects expire independently at rate δ.
The three components of projects’ productivity evolve according to
√
dεf t = −θε (εf t − 1) dt + σε εf t dBf t

(2)

√
dujt = −θu (ujt − 1) dt + σu ujt dBjt

(3)

dxt = µx xt dt + σx xt dBxt ,
3

(4)

Firms with no current projects can be viewed as firms that temporarily left the sector. Likewise, idle
firms that begin operating a new project can be viewed as new entrants. Thus, our model implicitly captures
entry and exit by firms.

7

where dBf t , dBjt and dBxt are independent standard Brownian motions. All idiosyncratic
shocks are independent of the aggregate shock: dBf t · dBxt = 0 and dBjt · dBxt = 0. The
firm and project-specific components of productivity are stationary processes, while the
process for aggregate productivity follows a Geometric Brownian motion, generating longrun growth.
Investment
Firms acquire new projects exogenously according to a Poisson process with a firm-specific
arrival rate λf t . At the time of investment, the project-specific component of productivity
is at its long-run average value, ujt = 1.
The firm-specific arrival rate of new projects is
λf t = λf · λ̃f t

(5)

where λ̃f t follows a two-state, continuous-time Markov process with transition probability
matrix between time t and t + dt given by
P =

1 − µL dt
µL dt
µH dt
1 − µH dt

!
.

(6)

We label the two states as [λH , λL ], with λH > λL . Thus, at any point in time, a firm can
be either in the high-growth (λf · λH ) or in the low-growth state (λf · λL ), and µH dt and
µL dt denote the instantaneous probability of entering each state respectively. Without loss
of generality, we impose that E[λ̃f t ] = 1, which translates to the restriction
1 = λL +

µH
(λH − λL ).
µH + µL

(7)

When presented with a new project at time t, a firm must make a take-it-or-leave-it
decision. If the firm decides to invest in a project, it chooses the associated amount of
capital Kj and pays the investment cost zt−1 xt Kj . The cost of capital relative to its average

8

productivity depends on the stochastic process zt , which follows a Geometric Brownian
motion
dzt = µz zt dt + σz zt dBzt ,

(8)

where dBzt · dBxt = 0. The z shock is the embodied, investment-specific (IST) shock in our
model, representing the component of the price of capital that is unrelated to its current
level of average productivity x. A positive realization of z reduces the cost of new capital
goods and thus leads to an improvement in investment opportunities.
Valuation
Let πt denote the stochastic discount factor. For simplicity, we assume that the aggregate
productivity shocks xt and zt have constant prices of risk, γx and γz respectively, and the
risk-free interest rate r is also constant. Then,
dπt
= −r dt − γx dBxt − γz dBzt .
πt

(9)

This form of the stochastic discount factor is motivated by a general equilibrium model
with IST shocks in Papanikolaou (2011). IST shocks endogenously affect the representative
household’s consumption stream, and hence they are priced in equilibrium.
Firms’ investment decisions are based on a tradeoff between the market value of a new
project and the cost of physical capital. Given (9), the time-t market value of an existing
project j, p(εf t , ujt , xt , Kj ), is equal to the present value of its cashflows

Firms’ investment decisions are straightforward because the arrival rate of new projects
is exogenous and does not depend on their previous decisions. Thus, optimal investment
decisions are based on the NPV rule. Firm f chooses the amount of capital Kj to invest in
project j to maximize
p(εf t , 1, xt , Kj ) − zt−1 xt Kj

(12)

Proposition 1 The optimal investment Kj in project j undertaken by firm f at time t is
1

K ∗ (εf t , zt ) = (αzt A(εf t , 1)) 1−α .

(13)

The scale of the firm’s investment depends on firm-specific productivity, εf t , and the IST
shock zt . Because the marginal productivity of capital in (1) is infinite at zero, it is always
optimal to invest a positive and finite amount.
The value of the firm can be computed as the sum of market values of its existing projects
and the present value of its growth opportunities. The former equals the present value of
cash flows generated by existing projects. The latter equals the expected discounted NPV of
future investments. Following the standard convention, we call the first component of firm
value the value of assets in place, V APf t , and the second component the present value of
growth opportunities, P V GOf t .
The value of a firm’s assets in place is the value of its existing projects:

Examining equation (15), the value of growth opportunities depends on two systematic
sources of risk. In addition to aggregate productivity x, the present value of growth opportunities depends on the IST shock, z, because the net present value of future projects depends
on the cost of new investment.

Risk and Risk Premia
Both assets in place and growth opportunities have constant exposure to the systematic
shocks dBxt and dBzt . However, their betas with respect to the IST shock z are different. In
particular, the value of assets in place is independent of the IST shock z and loads only on
the aggregate productivity shock x. In contrast, the present value of growth option depends

11

positively on aggregate productivity x and the IST shock z. Thus, the firm’s stock return
beta with respect to the IST shock is time-varying, and depends linearly on the fraction of
firm value accounted for by growth opportunities:
βfzt =

(22)

Since, by assumption, the price of risk of aggregate shocks is constant, the expected
excess return of a firm is an affine function of the weight of growth opportunities in firm
value, as shown in the following proposition:
Proposition 3 The expected excess return on firm f is

(23)

Many existing models of the cross-section of stock returns generate an affine relation
between expected stock returns and firms’ asset composition similar to (23) (e.g., Berk et al.
(1999), Gomes et al. (2003)). The distinguishing feature of our model is the presence of two
aggregate shocks x and z. Thus, realized returns have a conditional two-factor structure,
and as a result the conditional CAPM fails to price the cross-section of stock returns.
Whether the relation (23) gives rise to a value (or growth) premium depends on the
risk premia attached to the two aggregate shocks, γx and γz . Most equilibrium models
imply a positive price of risk for disembodied technology shocks, so γx > 0. The price
of risk of the IST shock γz depends on preferences. Papanikolaou (2011) shows that under
plausible preference parameters, states with low cost of new capital (high z) are high marginal
valuation states, which is analogous to a negative value of γz . In Papanikolaou (2011),
households attach higher marginal valuations to states with a positive IST shock because in
those states households substitute resources away from consumption and into investment.
We infer the price of risk of IST shocks from the cross-section of stock returns. In
particular, firms’ market-to-book (M/B) ratios are positively correlated with the share of
12

growth opportunities to firm value P V GOf /Vf . Empirically, growth firms have relatively
high exposure to IST shocks and relatively low expected excess returns. This suggests that
the market price of IST shocks is negative.

2.2

Investment-Good Producers

There is a continuum of firms producing new capital goods. We assume that these firms
produce the demanded quantity of capital goods at the current unit price zt . Furthermore,
profits of investment firms are a fraction φ of total sales of new capital goods.4 Consequently,
R
R
profits accrue to investment firms at a rate of Πt = φ zt xt λ F Kf t df , where λ = F λf t is
the average arrival rate of new projects among consumption-good producers.5

The value of the investment firms equals the present value of their cash flows. If we
assume that these firms incur proportional costs of producing their output, and given that
the market price of risk is constant for the two shocks, the value of the investment firms is
proportional to the aggregate investment expenditures in the economy. The stock returns of
the investment firms then load on the IST shock z as well as the disembodied productivity
shock x.
4

These assumptions are made for simplicity. Alternatively, we could specify z as the productivity shock to
the investment sector, which produces capital goods using a fixed factor of production. The two formulations
are equivalent.
5

The firm-level arrival rate λf t has a stationary distribution, so λ is a constant.

13

A positive IST shock z benefits the investment-good producers. Even though the price
of their output declines, the elasticity of investment demand with respect to price is greater
than one, so their profits increase. Hence, we can use the relative stock returns of the
investment and consumption good producers to create a factor-mimicking portfolio for the
IST shock.
We define the IMC portfolio in the model as the portfolio that is long the investment
sector and short the consumption sector. The instantaneous return on the IMC portfolio
RtI − RtC is given by
RtI − RtC = Et [RtI − RtC ] dt +

Equation (27) is the basis of our empirical approach to measuring growth opportunities.
The beta of firm f ’s return with respect to the IMC portfolio return is proportional to
its beta with the investment shock defined in equation (22), and is thus proportional to the
fraction of firm f ’s value represented by its growth opportunities. Firms that have few active
projects but expect to create many projects in the future derive most of their value from
their future growth opportunities. These firms are anticipated to increase their investment
in the future, and their stock price reflects that.

Data and Calibration

Here, we describe the construction of our main variables and the calibration of our model.

14

3.1

Data

We focus our analysis on firms in the consumption-good sector, following our theoretical
analysis above. We relegate the details to Appendix A.
Investment-specific shocks
We focus on four measures of capital-embodied technical change directly implied by the
model. The first measure of IST shocks is based on the quality-adjusted price of new capital
goods, as in Greenwood et al. (1997, 2000). Similar to real business cycle models with IST
shocks, in our model the cost of capital goods relative to their productivity z −1 is directly
related to the IST shock.
We use the quality-adjusted price series of new equipment constructed by Gordon (1990),
and extended by Cummins and Violante (2002) and Israelsen (2010). We normalize the price
of new equipment by the NIPA consumption deflator. As Fisher (2006) points out, the real
equipment price experiences an abrupt increase in its average rate of decline in 1982, which
could be due to the effect of more accurate quality adjustment in more recent data (see
e.g., Moulton (2001)). To address this issue, we remove the time trend from the series
of equipment prices and define investment-specific technological changes as negative of the
change in the de-trended log relative price of new equipment goods. Specifically, we construct
a de-trended equipment price series ztI by regressing the logarithm of the quality-adjusted
price of new equipment pI relative to the NIPA personal consumption deflator on a piece-wise
linear time trend:
pIt = a0 + b0 11982 + (a1 + b1 11982 ) · t − ztI

(28)

where 11982 is an indicator function that takes the value 1 post 1982. We measure investmentspecific technology shocks as ∆ztI . Our results are similar when we use residuals from an
AR(1) model or simple first differences of the relative price series. The series ∆ztI is positively

15

correlated with the series of returns on the IMC portfolio. The historical correlation between
the two series is 22.3% with a HAC-t-statistic of 2.31.
Our second measure is based on the stock return spread between investment- and consumptiongood producers (IMC portfolio). As we see from equation (26), the IMC portfolio is spanned
by the IST shock. Hence, we use returns to the IMC portfolio as a factor-mimicking portfolio for IST shocks. To construct the IMC portfolio, we first classify industries as producing
either investment or consumption goods according to the NIPA Input-Output Tables. We
then match firms to industries according to their NAICS codes. Gomes, Kogan, and Yogo
(2009) and Papanikolaou (2011) describe the details of this classification procedure.
As a robustness test, we also consider an additional proxy for IST shocks based on real
variables, that is, the ratio of aggregate investment to consumption. In our model, a positive
IST shock leads to an improvement in investment opportunities, and therefore to an increase
in aggregate investment relative to the output of the consumption sector. As a result, the
aggregate log investment-to-consumption ratio is positively correlated with the IST shock z:

Since χt is a locally deterministic process, innovations in the investment-to-consumption
ratio are driven by the IST shock z. Hence, we construct our alternative proxy for the
IST shock z as the first difference of the log ratio of non-residential private investment to
consumption of non-durables plus services. Using residuals from an AR(1) model rather
than first differences leads to similar results. The correlation between the two real proxies
 
I
for the investment shock z and ∆ ln CItt is equal to 34%.

16

To illustrate the connection in our model between the value factor and IST shocks, we
construct the equivalent of the HML portfolio as in Fama and French (1993). To be consistent
with our model, we focus on firms producing consumption goods.6 Our HM L portfolio with
consumption-sector firms has a correlation of 92% with the Fama and French (1993) HM L
factor.
In the left panel of Table 1 we show the moments of the two portfolios, IMC and HML
constructed using consumption firms only. The IMC portfolio has a negative average return
of -1.9% and a standard deviation of 11%, while our version of the value factor has an
average return of 3.4% and a standard deviation of 9.3%. In our model, the value factor
is negatively correlated with the IST shock z, because firms’ market-to-book ratios are
positively correlated with the ratio of growth opportunities to firm value. In the data, the
correlation between IMC and HML is -56%.
The IMC and HML portfolios are both mispriced by the CAPM, having alphas of -2.9%
and 4.1% respectively. Importantly, even though both portfolios are diversified, they have
low correlation with the market portfolio (R2 of 6.7% to 9.9%). Hence, these two portfolios
are correlated with a source of systematic risk distinct from the market portfolio. Investment
firms tend to be on average smaller than consumption firms, thus the IMC portfolio has a
positive size tilt. Its alpha with the market portfolio and the size (SMB) factor is -3.7%.
Finally, and consistent with our model, the Fama and French (1993) model prices both
portfolios.
Growth opportunities
Here, we construct measures of growth opportunities that are motivated by our model. The
firm’s asset composition between growth opportunities and assets in place changes over time,
6

We construct a 2 × 3 sort, sorting firms first on their market value of equity (CRSP December
market capitalization) and then on their ratio of Book-to-Market (Compustat item ceq). We construct
the breakpoints using NYSE firms only. We construct our value factor in the consumption sector as
1/2(SV − SG) + 1/2(LV − LG), where SG, SV, LG and LV refer to the corner portfolios.

17

as new projects are acquired, old projects expire, or investment opportunities change. Thus,
it is important that our empirical proxies for growth opportunities capture these fluctuations.
Our first empirical measure of growth opportunities is directly implied by our model.
Equation (22) shows that the firm’s ratio of the value of growth opportunities to total firm
value is proportional to the sensitivity of its stock return to the IST shock z. Thus, given our
high-frequency proxy for the IST shock (IMC portfolio), we estimate time-varying IST-betas
for each firm,
imc
rf tw = αf t + βfimc
t rtw + εf tw ,

w = 1 . . . 52.

(31)

Here rf tw refers to the log return of firm f in week w of year t, and rfimc
tw refers to the log
return of the IMC portfolio in week w of year t. Thus, βfimc
t is constructed using information
only in year t. The slope estimate of equation (31) is the direct counterpart of equation (27)
in the model. To evaluate the accuracy of a firm’s estimated IMC-beta as a measure of
growth opportunities, we also use equation (31) to estimate β imc in simulated data.
Our second measure of growth opportunities is the firm’s market-to-book ratio. The
value of growth opportunities enters the market value of the firm but not the book value of
capital. Hence, a firm’s market-to-book ratio is positively correlated with the ratio of growth
opportunities to firm value in our model. We construct the firm’s market-to-book ratio as
the ratio of the market value equity to the book value of equity.7
Both of these measures of growth opportunities are noisy measures of P V GO/V . The
firm’s IMC beta contains estimation noise. The firm’s market to book ratio is a noisy measure
of growth opportunities because it is influenced by the productivity u of existing projects.8
Hence, in our empirical analysis we report results using both measures.
7

In our model firms are financed entirely by equity. Hence, the ratio of market-to-book equity and Tobin’s
Q are the same. In our empirical work, we use the ratio of market-to-book equity to sort firms into portfolios
in order to be close to the literature on the value premium. However, using Tobin’s Q instead produces very
similar results.

3.2

Calibration

We calibrate our model to approximately match moments of aggregate dividend growth and
investment growth, accounting ratios, and asset returns. Thus, most of the parameters are
chosen jointly based on the behavior of financial and real variables. Table 2 summarizes our
parameter choices.
[Table 2]
We model the distribution of mean project arrival rates λf = E[λf t ] across firms as
λf = µλ δ − σλ δ log(Xf ),

Xf ∼ U [0, 1].

(32)

We choose the project decreasing returns-to-scale parameter α = 0.85, the parameters governing the projects’ cash flows (σε = 0.2; θε = 0.35; σu = 1.5; and θu = 0.5), and the
parameters of the distribution of λf (σλ = 2; µλ = 2), in order to match the average values
and the cross-sectional distribution of the investment rate, the market-to-book ratio, and
the return to capital.
We select the dynamics of the stochastic component of the firm-specific arrival rate
(µH = 0.075; µL = 0.16; and λH = 2.35) to ensure that the firm grows at about twice
the average rate in its high-growth phase and at about a third of the average rate in the
low-growth phase.
We set the project expiration rate δ to 10%, to be consistent with commonly used values
for the depreciation rate. We choose the parameters governing the dynamics of the shocks
xt and zt to match the first two moments of the aggregate dividend growth and investment
growth. We choose φ = 0.07 to match the relative size of the consumption and investment
sectors in the data.
The parameters of the pricing kernel, γx = 0.69 and γz = −0.35 are picked to match
approximately the average excess returns on the market portfolio and the IMC portfolio.
We set the interest rate r to 2.5%, which is close to the historical average real risk-free rate.
19

We simulate the model at a weekly frequency (dt = 1/52) and time-aggregate the data
to form annual observations. We simulate 1,000 samples of 2,500 firms over a period of 100
years. We drop the first half of each simulated sample to eliminate the dependence on initial
values. Unless noted otherwise, we report median moments estimates and t-statistics across
simulations.
[Table 3]
In Table 3, we compare the estimated moment in the data to the median moment estimate
and the 5th and 95th percentiles in simulated data. In most cases, the median moment
estimate of the model is close to the empirical estimate. The model matches the moments
of aggregate dividend and investment growth, the moments of the market portfolio and the
mean and dispersion in most firm characteristics.
In some cases, the model generates median point estimates that are different than the
empirical estimates. However, the empirical estimates lie within the 90% confidence intervals
implied by the model. First, the model produces a somewhat lower average return on the
IMC portfolio, −3.9% vs −1.9% in the data.9 Second, the distribution of firm size produced
by the model is somewhat less skewed than in the data. The ratio of median to average
firm size is higher than in the data (0.70 versus 0.20), since the model does not generate a
sufficient number of large firms. Similarly, the dispersion of estimated IMC-beta is higher
in the data (0.99) than in the model, but this is may be partly due to higher measurement
error in the data than in the model. Third, the median value of Tobin’s Q in the data is a
bit smaller than in the model (1.41 vs 1.98). The average level of Tobin’s Q in the model
depends on a number of simplifying assumptions, such as the absence of labor costs and
financial leverage.
9

Investment firms tend to be quite a bit smaller than consumption firms, so the size effect may bias
the estimated return of the IMC portfolio upwards. Two pieces of evidence support this conjecture: when
excluding the month of January, which is when the size effect is strongest, the average return on the IMC
portfolio is −3.5%; in addition, its alpha with respect to the Small-minus-Big (SMB) portfolio of Fama and
French (1993) is −3.7%, as we see in Table 1.

Empirical Implications

In this section, we explore the empirical predictions of our model.

4.1

Inspecting the Mechanism

Here, we explore direct tests of the mechanism. In particular, there are two main predictions
of our model. First, growth opportunities are proportional to firms’ stock return betas with
the IMC portfolio. Second, firms with more growth opportunities increase their investment
more following a positive IST shock. Since growth opportunities are not observable directly,
we take two approaches. In the first approach, we test both predictions jointly using firms’
IMC betas as a measure of growth opportunities. In the second approach, we use the firms’
market to book ratios as an approximate measure of growth opportunities. In both cases,
we compare our empirical findings to the output of the calibrated model.
Growth opportunities and IMC-beta
Here, we show that our measure of growth opportunities (IMC-beta) is related to firm
characteristics commonly associated with growth opportunities. In Table 4, we report the
time-series average of firm characteristics in each of the 10 portfolios sorted on IMC-beta.
The top panel shows results in the historical data, and the bottom panel shows results in
simulated data from the model. As we see in the top panel of Table 4, our portfolio sorting
procedure is successful in generating ex-post dispersion in sensitivities with both the ISTmimicking portfolio (IMC, second row) and the IST shock constructed using the price of
equipment ∆z I (third row). The difference in sensitivities between the highest and lowest
portfolio is statistically significant at the 1% level.
The pattern of firm characteristics across the portfolio deciles is consistent with our
interpretation of IMC-beta as measuring heterogeneity in growth opportunities. Within the
consumption sector, firms in the highest IMC-beta portfolio invest more (14.8% investment
rate) than firms in the lowest IMC-beta portfolio (10.7%). Moreover, highest IMC-beta
21

firms tend to have higher Tobin’s Q (2.39), and have higher R&D expenditures (6.0% as a
fraction of sales) than lowest IMC-beta firms (1.49 and 1.4% respectively). In addition, high
IMC-beta firms seem to exhibit higher preference for liquidity, since they hold more cash
(11.4% vs 6.6%) and pay lower dividends (2.8% vs 9.0%) than lowest IMC-beta firms.
High IMC-beta firms tend to be smaller, both in terms of their market capitalization as
well as their book value of capital. The highest IMC-beta portfolio accounts for a fraction of
3.9% (2.8%) of the total market capitalization (book value) of capital versus 8.8% (9.8%) for
the lowest IMC-beta portfolio. Finally, there is little difference in the ratio of debt to assets
across these portfolios, suggesting that these differences in beta are not due to differences in
financial leverage.
[Table 4]
As we see in the bottom panel of Table 4, the model mimics most of the empirical patterns
above. Firms in the highest IMC-beta portfolio have higher investment rates (14.0%) and
higher Tobin’s Q (3.30) relative to the firms in the lowest IMC-beta portfolio (7% and 1.05
respectively). In addition, as in the data, high IMC-beta firms tend to have smaller size,
measured either by their market capitalization or by their capital stock.
Investment
The main mechanism of our model is that firms with higher growth opportunities, being
better positioned to take advantage of positive IST shocks, should increase their investment
more in response to a positive IST shock than firms with lower growth opportunities. Since
growth opportunities are not observable directly, our empirical tests rely on the observable
proxies for growth opportunities motivated by the model. Thus, we jointly evaluate the
validity of the main mechanism of our model and the model-based empirical proxies for the
IST shocks and the market value of firms’ growth opportunities.
We compare the investment response of firms with different measures of growth opportunities (IMC-beta or market-to-book) to a positive IST shock. We use the following
22

specification:
if t = a 1 +

5
X

ad D(Gf,t−1 )d + b1 ∆zt−1 +

d=2

5
X

bd D(Gf,t−1 )d ∆zt−1 + c Xf,t−1 + ut ,

(33)

d=2

where it is the firm’s investment rate; ∆zt refers to measures of the IST shock; D(Gf )d
is a dummy variable that takes the value one if the firm’s growth opportunity measure
Gf ∈ {βfimc , Mf /Bf } belongs to the quintile d in year t − 1; X is a vector of controls which
includes the firm’s Tobin’s Q, leverage, cash flows, log of its capital stock relative to the
aggregate capital stock, and firm fixed effects. Definitions of these variables are standard
and are summarized in Appendix A. We standardize all variables to zero mean and unit
standard deviation. We cluster standard errors by firm and year, following Petersen (2009).
To evaluate the ability of the model to quantitatively replicate the data, we also estimate (33)
using simulated data from the model.
We estimate equation (33) using four proxies for the IST shock implied by the model: i)
returns to the IMC portfolio, Rimc ; ii) our measure based on the price of equipment, ∆z I ;
iii) the first difference of the aggregate log investment-to-consumption ratio, ∆ic; and iv)
minus the returns to the value factor (using consumption firms only), −Rhml . To account
for time-to-build, we use two lags of each measure as regressors in (33), so for instance
imc
.
∆zt = Rtimc + Rt−1

We focus on the coefficients (b1 , . . . , b5 ) on the dummy variables, which measure differences in the response of investment to IST shocks. We report the results in Tables 5 and
6. Panel A of Table 5 compares the response of investment to IMC portfolio returns for
firms with different measures of growth opportunities. The first column shows that a onestandard-deviation IMC return shock is associated with an increase in firm-level investment
by 0.09 standard deviations on average. Columns two and three show how this investment
response varies with the firm’s IMC-beta. Specifically, the sensitivity of the investment rate
to our measure of IST shocks varies between 0.048 for the low-β imc firms and 0.179 for the
high-β imc firms. When we include firm-level controls, the difference in investment sensitivity
23

drops somewhat to 0.08, but is still statistically significant at the 1% level. Columns (4) and
(5) show that results are similar if we proxy for growth opportunities using market to book
ratios.
Our results are similar using the other three measures of IST shocks, as we show in
Table 6. Panel A shows that a positive one-standard deviation IST shock constructed using the price of equipment ∆z I is associated with a 0.031 standard deviation increase in
investment for the average firm. However, this response varies dramatically in the crosssection, ranging from −0.01 to 0.093 between firms in the low- and high IMC-beta quintiles
respectively. Panel B shows that using the investment-to-consumption ratio ∆ic to measure
IST shocks leads to comparable results. Following a positive one-standard deviation shock,
high IMC-beta firms increase investment by 0.17 standard deviations, while low IMC-beta
firms increase investment by 0.04 standard deviations. Using the market-to-book ratio as
a measure of growth opportunities leads to comparable, but often quantitatively smaller
effects.
Panel C shows that the common factor in firms’ investment rates is related to the value
factor in returns. Following a one-standard deviation negative change in the value factor,
firms with high IMC-beta (market-to-book) increase investment by 0.071 (0.086) standard
deviations, while firms with low IMC-beta (market-to-book) exhibit no statistically significant response.
The magnitude of this investment comovement is economically significant. Our point
estimates imply that a positive one-standard deviation shock to ∆zt increases the level of
investment rate of high-growth firms relative to low-growth firms by 0.4% to 3.1%, depending
on the specification. Fluctuations in the investment rate of this magnitude are substantial
relative to the median level of the investment rate (11%) in the population of firms. Moreover,
these fluctuations are not diversified across firms. Hence, these fluctuations are also large
relative to the unconditional volatility of the aggregate investment rate changes in our sample,
which is 2.4%.
24

Panel B of Table 5 shows that our model generates comovement in investment rates across
firms that is quantitatively similar to the data. To conserve space, we only report results
using returns to the IMC portfolio to proxy for IST shocks. Results are very similar using
the other three measures, since all measures are highly correlated in the model. In simulated
data, a positive one-standard deviation IST shock leads to an increase in firm-level investment
of 0.053 standard deviations. The impact of investment shocks varies in the cross-section
of firms from 0.08 to 0.10 depending on the measure of growth opportunities. Similar to
the data, including firm-level controls reduces the difference in investment responses among
high- and low-growth firms to 0.03-0.04.
Our empirical results confirm that the firms identify as rich in growth opportunities
increase their investment more following a positive IST shock relative to firms we identify
as poor in growth opportunities. Furthermore, consistent with the prediction of our model,
the common factor in firms’ investment rates is related to the value factor.
Alternative Interpretations
Here we explore alternative interpretations of our empirical findings. To conserve space, we
briefly summarize the results of additional tests and refer the reader to the Internet Appendix
for details.
First, our results could be consistent with a Q-theory model, under the assumption that
stock returns have a multi-factor structure. Under this alternative, a multi-factor structure
in returns implies a multi-factor structure of changes in Tobin’s Q, generating a similar
factor structure in investment rates. We explore this alternative by estimating a modified
version of (33), replacing Gf with the firm’s market beta and ∆z with returns to the market
portfolio. The market portfolio is a major source of comovement in the cross-section of
stock returns, thus under this alternative it should lead to a high degree of comovement in
investment rates. We find no evidence to support this alternative. The investment of high

25

and low market-beta firms has the same response to the market portfolio, even though the
stock returns of these firms respond very differently.
Second, IMC betas may capture firms’ financial constraints and not the differences in
their real production opportunities. If financial constraints limit firms’ ability to take advantage of new investment opportunities, the market value of such growth opportunities may
be relatively low. To sharpen the interpretation of our empirical results, we replicate our
empirical analysis on a sample of firms that have been assigned a credit rating by Standard
and Poor’s. Such firms are relatively less likely to be financially constrained, as they have
access to the public debt markets. We find that our results are stronger in this subsample,
indicating that our findings are unlikely to be explained by financial constraints.
Third, we estimate IMC-betas using stock return data, while the theory suggests using
returns on the total firm value. To address this concern, we approximate firm-level IMCbetas by de-levering the equity-based estimates under the assumption that firms’ debt is
risk-free. We find that our results remain similar, regardless of whether we use book or
market leverage.
Fourth, we consider whether IMC-betas capture inter-industry linkages rather than differences in growth opportunities. We construct IMC-beta quintiles based on the firm’s
intra-industry IMC-beta ranking, using the 30-industry classification of Fama and French
(1997). Our results are slightly stronger in this case, suggesting that our findings are driven
by intra- rather than inter-industry variation.

4.2

Asset Prices

Our model implies that heterogeneity in stock return exposure to IST shocks leads to crosssectional differences in equity risk premia. Here, we evaluate the ability of our model to
jointly reproduce the cross-section of risk premia and the patterns of return comovement in
the data.

26

Risk Premia and Return Comovement
We first explore how growth opportunities are related to average returns and CAPM alphas,
in both the model and in the data. We focus on portfolios of firms sorted on our two measures
of growth opportunities, IMC-beta and book-to-market. We show the results in Tables 7
and 8, respectively.
[Table 7]
The top panel of Table 7 replicates the findings of Papanikolaou (2011), who shows that
sorting firms into portfolios based on IMC-betas results in a declining pattern of average
returns. However, as we see in the fourth row of Table 7, there is a strongly increasing
pattern in market betas. As a result, the CAPM misprices the IMC-beta portfolios. The
difference in average returns and CAPM alphas between the highest and lowest IMC-beta
portfolios is −3.2% and −7.1%, respectively.
There is also substantial return comovement within the IMC-beta sorted portfolios. The
portfolio long the top IMC-beta decile and short the bottom IMC-beta decile has a standard
deviation of 25.9%, yet the market captures only a small fraction of this variation (R2 =
27.9%). Thus, the long-short portfolio has exposure to a systematic risk factor that is
not captured by the market portfolio. Including the IMC portfolio captures most of this
comovement, increasing the R2 to 76%.
The bottom panel of Table 7 shows that our calibrated model reproduces these findings. The model replicates the declining pattern of risk premia across the IMC-beta deciles
accompanied by the increasing pattern of market betas. Hence, the model reproduces the
failure of the CAPM. The difference in average returns and CAPM alphas between the high
and low IMC-beta portfolios is −3.6% and −5.7% respectively. In the model, firms with
more growth opportunities have higher market exposure because the market portfolio is a
linear combination of the disembodied shock x and the IST shock z. Since all firms have the

27

same exposure to disembodied shocks x, firms with higher growth opportunities have higher
market betas.
Our simulation results illustrate that the presence of two aggregate shocks generates
magnitudes of return comovement comparable to the data. The long-short portfolio of high
vs low IMC-beta deciles has a standard deviation of 10.5%, yet it is not spanned by the
market portfolio (R2 = 34.6%).
[Table 8]
Next, we assess the ability of our model to replicate the empirical relation between stock
returns and the book-to-market ratio (B/M ). The top panel of Table 8 replicates the wellknown value premium in our sample (see e.g., Fama and French (1992, 1993)). Sorting firms
on their ratio of book-to-market equity generates large differences in average returns, but
virtually no differences in market betas. As a result, the difference in average returns and
CAPM alphas between value firms and growth firms is 6.1% and 5.9% respectively. Our
model produces significant dispersion in risk premia between value and growth firms, and
the failure of the CAPM. In simulated data, the difference in average returns and CAPM
alphas between the two extreme book-to-market portfolios is 4.3% and 6.3% respectively.
An important piece of the value puzzle is the presence of the value factor. In particular,
the long-short portfolio of high versus low B/M deciles has a standard deviation of 15.1%
and low correlation with the market portfolio. Motivated by this pattern, Fama and French
(1993) argue that value and growth firms have differential exposure to a systematic source of
risk that is not captured by the market portfolio. Our model replicates this pattern in return
comovement, as we see in the bottom panel of Table 8. The high minus low B/M portfolio
has a standard deviation of 10.6% and is not spanned by the market portfolio (R2 = 31.2%).
Thus, our model replicates the existence of the value factor, as well as the failure of the
CAPM to account for the value premium in stock returns.

28

The model mechanism behind the dispersion in risk premia and comovement among
high- and low-growth firms is that firms with different growth opportunities have different
exposures to IST shocks. We verify that the market-adjusted risk premia (CAPM alphas) of
firms with different growth opportunities are related to the heterogeneous exposures of these
portfolios to the IST shock. Figure 1 plots the portfolio CAPM alphas versus their betas
with respect to our two benchmark measures of the IST shock – changes in the relative price
of equipment ∆z I (top), and returns of the IMC portfolio Rimc (bottom). As we see in the
left panel of Figure 1, there is a strong and negative relation between the CAPM alphas of
the IMC-beta portfolios and their exposures to both measures of the IST shock z.
The right panel of Figure 1 shows that the corresponding relation between CAPM alphas
and IST shock exposure is similar for the cross-section of book-to-market portfolios. The two
extreme book-to-market portfolios have statistically different loadings on the IMC portfolio
(t-statistic of 2.4), but not on the changes in the price of equipment ∆z I (t-statistic of 1.2).
However, the difference in the exposure to ∆z I between the decile portfolios 9 and 2 is
statistically significant with a t-statistic of 2.1.
[Figure 1]
Our results of this section qualitatively support the view that the observed differences
in risk premia and comovement across high- and low-growth portfolios can be attributed to
heterogenous exposure to IST shocks. Next, we explore whether this observed difference in
IST shock sensitivity can account for the observed differences in risk premia for empirically
plausible values of the price of risk of IST shocks γz .
Market price of IST shocks
Consistent with our model, firms with different growth opportunities differ in their exposures
to IST shocks and their risk premia. In this section, we estimate empirically the market
prices of the IST and the disembodied technology shocks and compare the estimates to their

29

calibrated model counterparts. Moreover, we evaluate the extent to which the observed
differences in IST-risk exposures contribute to the observed differences in risk premia among
stocks with different growth opportunities.
We estimate the empirical equivalent of the stochastic discount factor (9) in our model,
m = a − γx ∆x − γz ∆z,

(34)

using the generalized method of moments (GMM). We use the model pricing errors as moment restrictions, namely, we impose that the SDF in equation (34) should price the crosssection of asset returns. The resulting moment restrictions are
E[Rie ] = −cov(m, Rie ),

(35)

where Rie denotes the excess return of portfolio i over the risk-free rate.10 We report firststage GMM estimates using the identity matrix to weigh moment restrictions, and adjust
the standard errors using the Newey-West procedure with a maximum of three lags. As a
measure of fit, we report the sum of squared errors from the Euler equations (35).
We proxy for IST shocks with the relative price of new equipment, ∆z I . As a robustness
test, we also use the change in the investment-to-consumption ratio, ∆ ln(I/C). For the
neutral technology shock x, we use the change in the (log) total factor productivity in the
consumption sector from Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006). We also consider specifications
of the SDF based on portfolio returns. In particular, we use a linear combination of the
market portfolio with either the IMC portfolio, or the HML portfolio, both of which span
the same linear subspace as the two technology shocks x and z in the model. We normalize
all shocks to unit standard deviation.
10

Since we use portfolio returns in excess of the risk free rate, the mean of the stochastic discount factor is
not identified. Without loss of generality, we choose the normalization E(m) = 1, which leads to the moment
restrictions (35). See Cochrane (2001), pages 256-258 for details.

Table 9 shows the estimation results for the ten IMC-beta portfolios in the data (top
panel) and in the model (bottom panel). The market price of the IST shock in columns (2)
and (3) is negative and statistically significant. Depending on whether we approximate IST
shock using equipment prices or the investment-to-consumption ratio, the point estimate
of the price of risk ranges between −0.68 and −0.91. The model produces comparable but
somewhat smaller estimates, −0.40 and −0.65 respectively. Thus, our calibrated price of
risk γz is conservative relative to the data.
In addition, the cross-sectional differences in the IST risk among the IMC-beta portfolios
account for a sizable portion of the differences in their average returns. Column (4) shows
that the unconditional CAPM produces large pricing errors (0.37%), similar to the model
in column (1) with only a disembodied productivity shock (0.41%). In contrast, adding the
real proxies for the IST shock to the SDF results in a substantial reduction in pricing errors
to 0.07% and 0.13% in columns (2) and (3) respectively. For comparison, adding IMC or
HML portfolio returns to the market return in columns (5) and (6) results in pricing errors
of 0.02% and 0.04% respectively.
[Table 9]
Table 10 shows similar results for the cross-section of ten B/M portfolios. The point
estimates of the market price of IST shocks are negative and significant, and somewhat larger
than those resulting from the model: the empirical estimates based on equipment prices and
the investment-to-consumption ratio are -0.98% and -1.09% respectively, compared to -0.43%
and -0.70% in the model. Furthermore, the pricing errors are substantially reduced by the
addition of the IST shock to the stochastic discount factor. The CAPM (column (4)) results
in pricing errors of 0.33%, while the two real proxies for the IST shocks above, together
with the disembodied shocks, result in pricing errors of 0.12% and 0.19% respectively. For
comparison, the combinations of the market portfolio with the IMC or HML portfolio returns
(columns 5 and 6) produce pricing errors of 0.16% and 0.06% respectively.
31

Our findings suggest that differential exposure to IST shocks generates sizable differences
in expected stock returns, and accounts for a significant part of the value premium. However,
we should be careful when interpreting these findings. In our analysis above, we treat the
estimated prices of risk as free parameters. In the case where the factors are portfolio returns,
an alternative strategy is to constrain the risk premium to equal the in-sample Sharpe ratio
of each portfolio. In this case, we find that the IMC portfolio does substantially worse in
pricing the book-to-market cross-section. The two factor model with the market portfolio
and IMC results in a sum of squared errors that is only moderately smaller than the CAPM
(0.43% versus 0.65%).11 We report the full set of results in the Internet Appendix.
[Table 10]
One important limitation of estimating the price of IST shocks using the portfolios formed
on the book-to-market ratios is that such portfolios have a strong factor structure. As discussed in Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) and Daniel and Titman (2012), this may result
in spurious empirical estimates of the market prices of shocks correlated with the common
factors among such portfolios. Both papers advocate the use of industry portfolios as a
pragmatic solution, since returns on these portfolios do not exhibit a strong low-dimensional
factor structure. We report the estimates of the SDF using the 30 Fama-French industry
portfolios (Fama and French (1997)) in Table 11. The point estimates of the market price
of IST shocks, when using the equipment price or the investment-to-consumption ratio as
empirical proxies (columns 2 and 3) are −0.52 and −0.70 respectively, which are comparable
to the estimates in Tables 9 and 10. As before, we find that the pricing errors of the SDF
using real proxies for the systematic risk factors are comparable to those obtained when
using portfolio returns – market, and IMC or HML.
[Table 11]
11

Constraining the price of risk to equal the in-sample Sharpe ratio is equivalent to a time-series test, since
it imposes that the SDF prices the market and IMC portfolio perfectly. See Cochrane (2001) for details.

32

We conclude that the market price of IST risk is negative, and the empirical estimates
are consistent in magnitude with the values we use in our calibration. Moreover, the crosssectional dispersion in average stock returns resulting from their heterogeneous exposures to
IST shocks captures a sizable portion of the return spread among the portfolios sorted on
the book-to-market ratio.

4.3

Cash Flows

Here, we show that our model closely replicates the empirical patterns of earnings and
profitability of value and growth firms. In particular, Fama and French (1995) document
that the cash flows of value and growth firms display a mean-reverting pattern. At the time
of portfolio formation, growth firms are more profitable in terms of return on equity (ROE)
than value firms. In the years following portfolio formation, profitability of growth firms
declines whereas the profitability of value firms increases. In contrast, earnings of growth
firms grow faster than those of value firms in the years after portfolio formation.
The top two panels of Table 12 replicate the findings of Fama and French (1995) for
the subset of firms producing consumption goods. As we see in the bottom two panels of
Table 12, our model reproduces these empirical patterns. In the model, growth firms have
higher earnings-to-book than value firms at the time of portfolio formation. Similar to the
data, over the next five years the average profitability of growth firms declines and the average
profitability of value firms rises. This pattern arises because firm (and project) productivity
is mean-reverting, hence this productivity gap dissipates over time. However, even though
the average profitability of growth firms declines, growth firms accumulate capital at a faster
rate than value firms. Hence, the earnings of growth firms grow faster than those of value
firms of similar size.

Conclusion

In the last few years we have seen significant developments in structural models of the crosssectional differences in risk premia. However, there has been far less progress in theoretical
analysis of the key sources of systematic risk in stock returns. In contrast, the empirical
literature has put forward a number of portfolio-based factor pricing models. However, the
economic sources of return comovement behind many of these factors are not well understood.
In this paper we show that investment-specific technology shocks are an important source
of systematic risk in the cross-section of stock returns. The key theoretical insight behind
our analysis is that firms with abundant growth opportunities benefit more from positive
investment-specific shocks than firms with limited growth opportunities, and therefore stock
returns of high-growth firms have higher exposure to IST shocks. Thus, cross-sectional differences in growth opportunities generate differences in risk premia and comovement among
stock returns and firm investment. In particular, our results suggest that the value factor in returns is partly driven by heterogeneous exposures of firms with different growth
opportunities to the IST shocks. Our empirical findings support the model’s predictions.
More generally, our analysis in this paper focuses on one type of embodied technology
shocks, that is, investment-specific technical change. Embodied shocks, by definition, do not
automatically benefit all firms uniformly. Thus, embodied shocks offer a promising avenue
for understanding the empirical patterns of comovement and dispersion in risk premia in
the cross-section of stock returns. A recent example of this line of research is Eisfeldt and
Papanikolaou (2011), who consider technology shocks embodied in the human capital of
firms’ key employees.

Sample
We omit firms with fewer than 50 weekly stock-return observations per year, firms producing
investment goods, financial firms (SIC codes 6000-6799) and utilities (SIC codes 4900-4949).
In our investment regressions we also exclude firms with missing values of CAPEX (Compustat item capx), PPE (Compustat item ppent), Tobin’s Q, firms in their first three years
following the first appearance in Compustat, and firms with negative book values. Our sample contains 6,832 firms and 63,295 firm-year observations and covers the 1965-2008 period.

Portfolio construction
HML portfolio We construct a 2 × 3 sort, sorting firms first on their market value of equity (CRSP December market capitalization) and then on their ratio of Book-to-Market (see
above for more details). We construct the value factor (HM L) as 1/2(SV − SG) + 1/2(LV −
LG), where SG, SV, LG and LV refer to the corner portfolios.
IMC portfolio We follow Gomes, Kogan, and Yogo (Gomes et al.) and Papanikolaou
(2011) and classify firms as investment or consumption producers based on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Income and Product Account (NIPA) tables. We classify
industries based on the sector to which they contribute the most value. We use the 1997
Input-Output tables to classify NAICS industries into investment or consumption producers.
We include common shares (shrcd=10,11) of all firms traded in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ
(exchcd=1,2,3).
10 IMC-beta portfolios We sort firms annually into 10 value-weighted portfolios based
on the past value of β imc . We estimate β imc using weekly returns. We include common
shares (shrcd=10,11) of all firms traded in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ (exchcd=1,2,3).
We restrict the sample to firms producing consumption goods, and exclude financial firms
(SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949). We rebalance the portfolios at the end of every
calendar year.
10 BE/ME portfolios We follow Fama and French (1993) and sort firms in the consumption
industry on their ratio of Book Equity (Compustat item ceq) to Market Equity (CRSP December market capitalization) into 10 portfolios. We include common shares (shrcd=10,11)
of all firms traded in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ (exchcd=1,2,3). We use NYSE breakpoints. We restrict the sample to firms producing consumption goods, and exclude financial
firms (SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949). We rebalance the portfolios on June of
every calendar year.

Table 1 shows time-series moments for the two IST-shock mimicking portfolios: IMC; and HML constructed
excluding investment firms. We show mean returns µ, the matrix of standard deviations and correlations
Σ, and alphas from the CAPM (columns 1-2), market and size (columns 3-4) and the Fama-French 3-factor
model (columns 5-6). We use the Fama-French factors constructed using all firms, from Kenneth French’s
website. Columns 7 and 8 show the corresponding moments in simulated data.

Table 3 compares sample moments to moments in simulated data. Stock return moments are estimated over
the sample 1963-2008. The moments of investment growth are estimated using the series on real private
nonresidential investment in equipment and software. Moments of firm-specific variables are estimated using
Compustat data over the 1963-2008 period, where we report time series averages of the median and interquintile range (IQR) of the investment rate; cashflows over capital; market to book ratio; IMC-beta and the
ratio of firm size to average firm size. Moments of dividend growth are from the long sample in Campbell
and Cochrane (1999).

imc
Table 4 shows summary statistics for ten portfolios of firms sorted by βt−1
. βtimc refers to the firm’s beta
with the investment minus consumption portfolio (IMC) in year t, estimated using non-overlapping weekly
returns within year t. We report time-series averages of the following firm characteristics: median P
Tobin’s
I
P
Q; total firm investment in the portfolio divided by the total capital stock in the portfolio, I/K = i∈P Kii ;
i∈P
the median cash holdings over assets, CASH/A; the median ratio of dividends plus share repurchases over
cash flows, DIV /CF ; the median ratio of research and development over sales R&D/A; the sum of property
plant and equipment (PPE) of firms in each portfolio scaled by the total PPE, k/K; cumulative market
capitalization of firms in each portfolio scaled by the aggregate market capitalization, m/M ; and the median
β imc on which firms are sorted into portfolios.

Table 5 shows the response of investment it to returns on the IMC portfolio for firms with different levels of
growth opportunities Gf . We consider two measures of growth opportunities Gf : the firms’s stock return
beta with the IMC portfolio, β imc , and the firm’s ratio of market-to-book equity (M/B). D(Gf )i is a dummy
quintile variable equal to 1 if firm f belongs in quintile i in year t − 1 and zero otherwise. We show results
with and without a vector of controls that includes firm-fixed effects and lagged values of log Tobin’s Q,
cashflows over lagged capital, log book equity over book assets, and log capital stock. See equation 33 for
more details on the specification. We compute standard errors using two-way clustering by firm and by year.
The top panel shows results in historical data. The sample period is 1965-2007. We exclude firms producing
investment goods, financial firms (SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949). The bottom panel shows
results in data simulated from the model. We report the average values of the estimated coefficients and
t-statistics (in parenthesis) across simulations. We simulate 1,000 samples. Each simulation sample contains
2,500 firms for 50 years. In each simulation, we exclude firms with no active projects.

Table 6 shows the response of investment it to measures of the IST shocks for firms with different levels
of growth opportunities Gf . We report results using three empirical proxies for the investment shock: (a)
the first difference of the de-trended log quality-adjusted relative price of investment goods from Israelsen
(2010); (b) changes in the log aggregate investment-to-consumption ratio; (c) negative of the returns on the
HML portfolio, constructed excluding firms producing investment goods. See equation 33 in text and notes
to Table 5 for more details on the specification.

The top panel of Table 7 reports return moments of decile portfolios sorted on IMC-beta. IMC-beta is
the firm’s beta with the investment-minus-consumption portfolio (IMC) in year t, estimated using nonoverlapping weekly returns within year t. The construction of the IMC portfolio is detailed in Papanikolaou
(2011). We restrict the sample to firms producing consumption goods, and exclude financial firms and
utilities. Standard errors are computed using Newey-West with 1 lag to adjust for autocorrelation in returns.
t-statistics are reported in parenthesis. We use monthly data and report annualized estimates of mean returns
and CAPM alphas by multiplying the monthly estimates by 12. The market portfolio includes the investment
and the consumption sector. The bottom panel reports median coefficient estimates in simulated data.

The top panel of Table 8 reports return moments of ten portfolios sorted on Book-to-Market Equity. We
restrict the sample to firms producing consumption goods, and exclude financial firms and utilities. We
use NYSE breakpoints for portfolio assignments, following Fama and French (1993). Standard errors are
computed using Newey-West with 1 lag to adjust for autocorrelation in returns. t-statistics are reported in
parenthesis. We use monthly data and report annualized estimates of mean returns and CAPM alphas by
multiplying the monthly estimates by 12. The market portfolio includes the investment and the consumption
sector. The bottom panel reports median coefficient estimates in simulated data.

Table 9 reports estimates of γx and γz from the model SDF: m = a−γx ∆x−γz ∆z. We use the cross-section
of ten portfolios sorted on IMC-beta. ∆x is the disembodied productivity shock; Rmkt is the market return;
∆z I is the first difference of the de-trended log quality-adjusted relative price of investment goods from
Israelsen (2010); ∆ic is the change in the log aggregate investment-to-consumption ratio; Rimc is the return
on the IMC portfolio (see Appendix A for details); −Rhml is the negative of the returns on the HML portfolio,
constructed excluding firms producing investment goods. The top panel presents empirical estimates using
annual data in the 1965-2008 period; we report first-stage estimates and sum of squared errors (SSQE) along
with 90% confidence intervals for point estimates computed using the Newey-West adjusted standard errors
(three lags). The bottom panel presents estimates from 1,000 simulations, each simulation spanning 50 years.
We report median point estimates across simulations, and confidence intervals computed using the 5% and
95% simulation percentiles.

Table 11 reports estimates of bx and bz from the model SDF: m = a − γx ∆x − γz ∆z. We use the 30
Fama and French (1997) portfolios, excluding the ’Other’ industry. See Appendix A and main text for more
details, and the footnote to Table 9 for variable deifnitions. We use annual data over the 1965-2008 period;
we report first-stage estimates and sum of squared errors (SSQE) along with t-statistics computed using the
Newey-West procedure with three lags.

Table 12 compares the empirical cash flow patterns of value and growth firms (Panel A) to the patterns
in simulated data (Panel B). In panel 1, we calculate post-formation changes in profitability, defined as
p
p
cash flows over portfolio book equity Ēt+i
/B̄t+i−1
, for size-BM portfolios formed in June of each year. Our
procedure closely mimics the construction in Fama and French (1995). The four portfolios LV , LG, SV , LG
refer to the corner portfolios of a 2-by-3 sort on ME and BE/ME using consumption firms only and NYSE
p
breakpoints. Ēt+i
equals the sum of earnings at time t + i of firms assigned to portfolio p in year t. In
panel 2, earnings are measured relative to the total earnings of the market portfolio constructed using only
consumption firms (Etm ), and then standardized to one at the portfolio formation date. Hence, for portfolio
p
m
p we compute Ēt+i
/Ēt+i
and Ētp /Ētm for each portfolio formation year t and lead/lag i using firms that have
data in years t and t + i. The two ratios are then averaged separately across portfolio formation years. See
the main text and Appendix A for variable definitions.

Figure 1 plots CAPM alphas versus IST-shock betas for two sets of portfolios. The left panel (A), uses ten
portfolios sorted on their univariate betas with respect to the IMC portfolio, β IM C (see Appendix A for the
details of IMC construction). The right panel (B) uses ten portfolios sorted on their book-to-market ratio.
We use two proxies for the IST shock z: (i) the negative of the changes in the de-trended log relative price
of investment goods ∆z I (see the definition in Section 3.1); (ii) returns on the IMC portfolio.
