China's Potential Future Growth and Gains from Trade Policy Bargaining: Some Numerical
Simulation Results

NBER Working Paper No. 17826

JEL No. C68,C78,D60
ABSTRACT
Numerical simulation analysis of bargaining solutions is little developed in existing literature. Here
we use a multi country, single period numerical general equilibrium model which captures China and
her major trading partners and examine the outcomes of trade policy bargaining solutions (bargaining
over tariffs and financial transfers) over time as China grows more rapidly than her trade partners.
We compute gains relative to non-cooperative Nash equilibria for a range of model parameterizations.
This yields a measure of both absolute and relative gain to China from bargaining. We calibrate our
model to base case data for 2008 and use a model formulation where there are heterogeneous goods
across countries. The gains from trade bargaining accrue more heavily to other countries when we
use 2008 data rather than later year data.
We then consider the impacts out into the future of different country growth rates which sharply increases
China’s relative size. Our objective is to assess how China’s gains from bargaining change over time;
whether they grow at a faster rate than GDP growth and for which parameterizations. Our simulation
results indicate that China’s welfare gain from trade bargaining will increase over time if countries
keep their present GDP growth rates for several decades, but there are major difference when using
different bargaining solution concepts. These differences have not been noted in existing literature
but have an intuitive explanation. Our results also indicate that if China jointly bargains along with
India, Brazil and other developing countries with the OECD, China’s gain will further increase. Bargaining
gains are also sensitive to country size. When we use PPP to adjust China’s relative GDP size; China’s
trade bargaining welfare gain increases by about 37%.

1. Introduction
China’s trade has grown rapidly in recent decades and has generated large trade
surpluses, which have financed an accumulation of foreign reserves. Exports have
become one of its main engines of economic growth which in turn have generated
adjustment resistance in importing countries. Increasingly over time this will take
China to more and more trade policy bargaining to try to use access for foreign
suppliers to the growing Chinese market as the bargaining chip to keep protection
abroad as low as possible given China’s export lead growth strategy. Given this
situation, an interesting question to ask is how China’s welfare gains from trade
bargaining might change over time if countries keep their present GDP growth rates
and China’s relative size in the global economy progressively grows further. Our
focus is the impact of growth on bargaining power over several decades. Our aim is
not only to capture China’s welfare gains from bargaining over time, and to
investigate China’s future shifting bargaining power, but also assess how calculated
gains from bargaining behave over time. Do they increase more or less rapidly than
relative GDP growth? Do they increase at an accelerating rate?
Existing literature on bargaining is theoretical and analytical rather than
numerical (Nash, 1950; Johnson, 1965; Kalai and Smorodinsky, 1975; Rubinstein,
1982; Roth et al, 1991; Trejos and Wright, 1995; Johnson et al, 2002; Cahuc et al,
2006; Kennan, 2010). The focus is on bargaining solution concepts and bargaining
theory, and only a few papers have used numerical techniques to compute bargaining
solutions (Trifon and Landau, 1974; Calmfors et al, 1988; Coles and Muthoo, 1998;
3

Carpenter, 2002). With the exception of Abrego et al (2001) this numerical literature
on bargaining does not use general equilibrium structures to numerically solve for
bargaining outcomes. They are instead mostly based on partial equilibrium models
and few of them have been used for simulation analyses related to concrete policy
issues. Our focus and methods, however, differ sharply from Abrego et al (2001) in
examining the links between bargaining power and growth rather than the links
between environmental policies and trade bargaining that they explore.
Our global general equilibrium model captures five countries, each of which is
endowed with two factors and produces two goods which are heterogeneous across
countries. Countries are linked through trade and they bargain on their own import
tariffs which, for simplicity, we assume are at uniform rates across goods imported
from a country, but can vary across country sources. Since, for now, China’s trade
partners are more heavily developed countries, we assume China bargains bilaterally
with the whole of the OECD. Using this model structure, we then explore bargaining
solution outcomes and simulate welfare gains for each bargaining partner under
various scenarios which reflect changes in country size as growth proceeds.
We adopt 2008 as our base year and build a benchmark data set which we use to
calibrate model parameters. We then analyze China’s welfare gains over time at ten
yearly intervals from 2010 to 2100 as China’s endowments grow at different rates
from those of other countries. These gains are computed as a sequence of single
period comparisons of numerical bargaining solutions using different solution
concepts (Nash (NBS), Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS)) relative to non-cooperative Nash
4

outcomes to yield measures of country gains from bargaining in both absolute size of
utility gain and each country’s relative gain. We evaluate China’s welfare gain over
time using both Nash bargaining and KS bargaining with the OECD, thus yielding the
change in China’s welfare gain over time from bargaining. We also evaluate China’s
welfare gain when bargaining jointly with the OECD with India and Brazil. We finally
compute China’s bargaining welfare gains over time using a purchasing power parity
(PPP) adjustment for China’s relative size in the 2008 base year data. We additionally
conduct sensitivity analysis of China’s bargaining welfare gains to elasticity
parameters.
Our simulation results show that China’s welfare gains from bargaining with the
OECD increase over time if all countries keep their present GDP growth rates. Using
the NB solution concept, China’s share of global bargaining gains grows to 41% in
2010; 67.7% in 2050 and 88.7% in 2100. This shows growth in bargaining gains at
roughly the rate of increase in relative GDP. China’s annual average growth rate in its
trade bargaining welfare gain using Nash bargaining is about 11%, just a little higher
than its GDP growth rate and the OECD’s is about 6%, higher than its GDP growth
rate. But using the KS-solution concept, things are different. China’s share of global
gains is only 10.6% in 2010, but grows much more rapidly to 70.9% in 2050 and to
99.1% in 2100; initially proportionally smaller but growing much faster, with the
opposite result for the OECD. This implies important numerical differences when
using Nash and KS bargaining solution concepts for numerical policy based work.
With asymmetric shifts in the utility possibility frontier due to growth, Nash
5

bargaining using tangencies between an implicit Cobb Douglas function and the
frontier, and the KS use of a utopia point proportional to intersections with axes which
behaves differently.
Additionally, when China joins with India and Brazil to jointly bargain with the
OECD or when we use a PPP adjustment for the GDP measure in 2008 for China’s
base case economic size, China’s welfare gain from bargaining increases by 40% and
37% compared to the Nash China-OECD bargaining case. Thus, if we take account of
China’s relative size via purchasing power parity, China’s welfare gain would be even
larger. It also emerges as a good strategy for China to join with other developing
countries to jointly bargain with the OECD exerting its bargaining power.
For computational reasons we use strong assumptions to conduct our analysis,
and these affect results. One key issue is that we use a balanced trade structure in our
general equilibrium model which neglects China’s trade surplus position and likely
over estimates China’s bargaining power since imports are smaller in reality due to
the surplus. However, this may not be as severe a problem as it may seem because
although we adjust trade data for each country’s trade to be balanced; for China we
only change ROW’s exports and imports to yield this result. Trade between China,
OECD, India and Brazil does not change and are the same as actual data in our
analysis. The balanced trade structure thus does not fundamentally change China’s
trade position with OECD, India and Brazil, and may not impact China’s trade
bargaining power. We do not, however, capture the potential bargaining component
for China from the strategic use of reserves to drive down exchange rates unless
6

market access for exports is preserved.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss China’s current trade
situation with other countries, and briefly discuss how future growth may change this.
Section 3 describes the model structure and the bargaining solution concepts we use.
Section 4 sets out our data used in calibration and reports calibrated parameters.
Section 5 reports simulation results and computes China’s trade bargaining welfare
gains for the growth scenarios discussed above. Section 6 offers conclusions,
implications and final remarks.

2. Background to China’s Trade Policy Bargaining
China’s trade has grown quickly in the past few decades. In 1980, export and
import values were only US$18.12 billion and US$20.02 billion, and the trade
imbalance was -1.9US$ billion. By 2010, China’s export and import values had
increased to US$1577.93 billion and US$1394.83 billion respectively, and the trade
balance was US$183.1 billion. China’s exports had thus increased 87.1 times and
imports 69.7 times over 30 years (CSY, 2010).
Large trade surpluses and export volumes bring trade disputes and China has also
been one of the largest recipient of trade disputes. In 2010, China’s trade disputes
included 64 antidumping cases, which covered US$7 billion in exports (MCS, 2010).
In the presence of these trade disputes, trade policy bargaining naturally occurs. By
the mid-2000s China was involved in negotiations with 27 countries and regions
regarding free trade agreements (FTAs) or Closer Economic Partnership Agreements
(CEPA). These now cover over one-fifth of China’s total trade. China has also signed
FTAs with the ten-member ASEAN group, Chile, Pakistan and New Zealand and is in
FTA negotiations with the six-member GCC, the five-member South African Customs
Union, and also Australia. In addition, China is also looking into the feasibility of
China–Japan–South Korea, China–Japan and China–South Korea FTAs (Hoadley and
Yang, 2008).
In the bargaining process, as we model it, China exchanges access commitments
to her own market in return for access commitments abroad. Globally joint gains will
be maximized under free trade, but bargaining can also involve financial transfers
8

which move countries along the global utility possibilities frontier. Bargaining
outcomes can also be represented analytically using a range of bargaining solution
concepts. Here we use Nash (1951) bargaining and an alternative solution concept
proposed by Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975). We measure the gain to China from trade
policy bargaining as the utility difference between that achieved under bargaining and
that represented by a disagreement outcome represented by a non-cooperative Nash
equilibrium. These are computed for the model presented below. Our interest is to
assess how China’s welfare gains from bargaining might change over time if all
countries were to keep their current country growth rates over different periods.
China’s high growth rate relative to other countries is expected to enhance her
bargaining power.
China’s trade with developing countries grew quickly over the last 10 years. If
we take India and Brazil as examples (Figure 1), China’s exports to and imports from
India increased 26 times and 15 times between 2000 and 2010. Brazil’s trade with
China has also grown quickly, and in this period the average annual growth rate
reached 154.5% (UN, 2010). Developing country growth rates of trade with China are
much higher than the average total trade growth rate for China between 2000 and
2010 (annually about 25%). But, although China-South trade has grown quickly,
China’s main export markets remain the developed countries, and we assume China
gains by cooperating with other developing countries to jointly bargain with
developed countries through our period of analysis, even though in reality differing
country growth rates could reverse the incentives.

3. Model Structure and Bargaining Solutions
We compute both non-cooperative and cooperative bargaining solutions utilizing
a 5 country numerical general equilibrium model with each country producing 2
goods and using 2 factors. We use the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity
by country in consumption and each country has import tariffs. We numerically
compute a sequence of Nash equilibria and alternative bargaining solutions over time,
treating each solution as corresponding to a single period outcome. These numerical
solutions vary over time due to the higher Chinese growth rate. We compute welfare
gains from bargaining as the utility difference between cooperative and
non-cooperative solutions for each period in time and do so for each bargaining
solution concept. We do this for each country in the model and under different growth
and size scenarios.
3.1 Model Structure
The model has five countries with each country producing two goods with two
factors. The five countries are China, OECD, India, Brazil and the rest of the world
(ROW). The two products are tradable goods and non-tradable goods, and the two
factor inputs are labor and capital.
On the production side of each economy, we assume CES functions in each
country and Figure 2 outlines the production structure we use. On the consumption
side, we assume a one level CES utility function for consumers in each country
(Figure 2). Under this treatment, individuals choose among domestic and imported
tradable goods and domestic non-tradable goods. The Armington assumption applies
11

for imported goods. Under this, domestic and imported goods are heterogeneous and
this removes specialization problems from the model.

The model assumes balanced trade as is conventional in general equilibrium
trade models; but we comment later on how to modify the model to account for
China’s large trade imbalance. Thus, in equilibrium, each country’s export

where PCi jh is the consumer price of good i in country j importing from country h.
Equation (5) is not a condition for equilibrium; it is instead a property of equilibrium
in our model structure.
3.2 Bargaining Solutions

We compute both bargaining and non-cooperative solutions to trade policy
games in the model by including import tariffs in the model. Countries mutually
consistently set strategically determined tariff rates in a Nash equilibrium and free
trade with tariffs between countries supporting bargained outcomes with appropriate
inter country lump sum transfers. For simplicity, in comparisons of Nash equilibrium
we assume country j has a uniform ad valorem import duty ti j across goods i, which
13

implies that:

PCi jh  (1  ti j ) Pi h ，

jh

(6)

For the global general equilibrium model set out above, we use a benchmark data
set to calibrate parameters, then numerically solve for bargaining solutions and
non-cooperative Nash equilibrium and then calculate each country’s welfare gain.
The non-cooperative tariff game we analyze is as originally formulated by Nash
(1950). After his initial characterization of a bargaining solution (closely related to
Cournot’s bilateral monopoly formulation) much subsequent work has generated other
solution concepts. Some of these are surveyed in Roth (1979), Kalai (1985), Peters
(1987, 1992), and Thomson (1985, 1994).
Despite the large numbers of solution concepts that have been introduced in the
literature, three play a central role in theory as it is widely used today (Thomson,
1994). One is Nash’s original solution concept, which selects the point at which the
product of utility gains is maximal. The second is a solution concept due to Kalai and
Smorodinsky (1975) named the KS-solution, which selects the point at which utility
gains are proportional to their maximal possible values within the feasible utility
possibilities set. Finally comes the Egalitarian solution (Thomson, 1983) that equates
utility gains relative to non-cooperative outcomes among players. We use Nash
bargaining (NBS) and KS solutions as our concepts in solving for bargaining
outcomes in our model as China’s size grows in the following ways.
3.2.1 Nash Bargaining Solution

Our formal statement of Nash’s cooperative two-person bargaining formulation
14

is as follows: Two agents have access to any of the alternatives in a set, called the
feasible set. Their preferences over these alternatives differ. If they agree on a
particular alternative, that is what they get. Otherwise, they end up at a prespecified
alternative in the feasible set, called the disagreement point. Both the feasible set and
the disagreement point are in utility space. Let them be given by S and d respectively.
Nash’s objective was to help to predict the compromises that agents would reach. He
specified a class of bargaining problems which conformed to his analysis, and he
defined a solution to be a rule that associates with each (S, d) in the class a point in S,
and interpreted this as the compromise. He formulated a list of properties, or axioms,
that he thought solutions should satisfy (Thomson, 1994).
Specifically, the NBS is obtained by maximizing the product of utility gains
relative to the disagreement point, that is, N(S, d) is the maximization of
Max ( X i  di )

X  S, X  d

(7)

Where Xi is the NBS utility of individual i, d is the disagreement point, and di is the
disagreement utility for individual i. Figure 3 depicts this solution concept for these
two cases.
3.2.2 KS-solution Concept

The KS-solution concept focuses on utility gains relative to the disagreement
point as proportional to the agents’ most optimistic expectations. For each agent, these
expectations are defined as the highest utility they can attain in the feasible set,
subject to the constraint that no agent should receive less than his coordinate at the
disagreement point.
15

More precisely, for a given bargaining problem (S, d) we can define the utopia
point u *  (u *A , uB* ) by
ui*  Max{ui | u  S , u j  d j for i  j}

i  A, B

(8)

The KS-solution is then given by
u KS ( S , d )  d   (u*  d )

(9)

Where   max{  IR | d   (u  d )  S} . In a two-person bargaining case, the
KS-solution can be described by the solution to:
Max[(u AKS  d A )  (u BKS  d B )]
s.t.

3.3 Using A Numerical GE Model to Analyze Bargaining and
Non-cooperative Nash Equilibria

We first compute non-cooperative equilibria and then using the same
parameterization of the model for the year at issue explore cooperative bargaining
outcomes for a sequence of model formulations which vary over time in the size of
China relative to other countries. To compute non-cooperative Nash equilibria, we
16

iterate over calculations of optimal tariff policy responses by individual regions to
tariff settings of other regions; subject to the constraint of full general equilibrium
within the period. We then iterate across country tariffs and then countries until
convergence to a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is achieved. We then compute
cooperative

NBS

and

cooperative

KS

solutions

associated

with

these

parameterizations as the next step.
In computing cooperative bargaining equilibria, we take the non-cooperative
Nash equilibrium utilities as representing the disagreement point, iteratively generate
the utility possibilities frontier under cooperation, and apply both the Nash or KS
criterion to the product of the differences in region utilities along the frontier and
disagreement utilities (Abrego et al, 2001).
In

computing

non-cooperative

equilibria,

we

adopt

Nash’s

(1951)

non-cooperative solution concept. In the five-country general equilibrium model, the
method for computing non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is to iterate over
calculations of optimal tariffs by individual countries, which are
Max(ui )

s.t. GE

i  country

(11)

where GE denotes a five country complete general equilibrium. We use (11) to obtain
convergence to a Nash equilibrium.
After computing non-cooperative equilibrium tariffs, we can determine the
disagreement point and then simulate the utilities possibilities frontier under
cooperation, and apply the Nash bargaining criterion
Max (ui  di )

s.t GE

i  A, B
17

(12)

to obtain the cooperative Nash bargaining equilibrium.
A solution to (10) determines the KS bargaining outcome. In the process of
solving for a KS bargaining solution, we need to calculate the utopia point
utility u *  (u*A , uB* ) , which we get by separately maximizing each bargaining partner’s
utility subject to the constraints of GE.
3.4 Welfare Gain from Bargaining and Bargaining Power

The country welfare gain from bargaining is taken to be the utility difference
between the disagreement point and a NBS or KS-solution. We use
gaini  uiNBS / KS  di  uiNBS / KS  uinon cooperative

i  country

(13)

NBS / KS
reflects utility in the
to denote the welfare gain from bargaining where ui

sharei 

gaini

 gaini

uiNBS / KS  d i
 (uiNBS / KS  di )

This latter index represents a country’s bargaining welfare gain as their share of the
total bargaining welfare gain.

4. Data and Calibration of Model Parameters
We use calibration of our general equilibrium model to base year data as in
Shoven and Whalley (1992) to generate the parameters for our model. We take 2008
as our base year and build a benchmark general equilibrium data set in which, also
following Shoven and Whalley (1992), all the model general equilibrium conditions
hold. In this data set, there are five countries China, OECD, India, Brazil and the
ROW, two sectors involving tradable goods and non-tradable goods, and two factor
inputs (capital and labor). We take services as non-tradable goods1 and manufactures
as tradable goods as in Abrego et al (2001). We use data for the world minus China,
OECD, India and Brazil to generate data for the ROW.
The data we use for the base case equilibrium in model calibration are shown in
Tables 1 and 2. Chinese data come mostly from the Chinese Statistical Yearbook
(CSY), OECD data from the OECD statistical database, and India and Brazil data
from the World Bank database. ROW data are calculated as a residual from world data
which are taken from the US CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) database. All bilateral
export and import data come from the UN database and the OECD statistical
database.
All data are converted to US$ at market exchange rates. Production, capital and
trade values in the tables are in billion US$. Export and import values for the OECD
are less than the sum of country statistics, because we have removed export and
import values between OECD countries. In numerical general equilibrium analysis, it
1
Non-tradable goods in our calculation includes: (1) wholesale and retail trade, repair, hotels; (2) Financial
intermediation, real estate, renting and business activity; (3) other service activities.
19

is usual to adjust data so as to set both producer and factor prices equal to 1. We have
so adjusted each country’s factor input and the ROW’s export and import data.

sum of OECD countries’ export and import values minus the sum of each OECD countries’ exports and imports between OECD
countries.
Source: All data for the OECD are from OECD statistics, http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?r=92830; Other export and import data are from
the UN interactive graphic system of international economic trends (SIGCI Plus), http://www.eclac.org/comercio/ecdata2/index.html.

The production and utility functions in our model are all CES; and the elasticity
specification used affects model results. There are no available estimates of
elasticities for China either on the demand or production side (Dong and Whalley,
2010). Many of the estimates of domestic and import goods substitution elasticities
for other countries are around 2 (Betina et al, 2006) and so we set all these elasticities
in the model equal to 2 (the same as Whalley and Wang (2010)). We later change
these elasticities in sensitivity analysis to check their impacts on simulation results.

In order to calculate bargaining partners’ welfare gains over time from 2010 to
2100, we use each country’s GDP growth rate in the future. We take each country’s
average annual GDP growth rate in the last decade (from 2001 to 2010) as the future
annual factor endowment growth rate in the model for the next 90 years from 2010 to
21002. We assume these growth rates are constant over time, and it is the differential
growth rates for China and other countries that enhances China’s bargaining power
over time.
Countries’ GDP growth rates between 2001-2010 are displayed in Figure 4. We
take the world growth rate as the ROW growth rate. From these data we see that
China’s and OECD’s annual average GDP growth rates in the last decade are 10.47%
and 1.66%; while the growth rates of India, Brazil and ROW are 7.85%, 3.62% and
2.50% (Table 4).
2

Here we use endowment growth to realize GDP growth in the same rate may not very accurate, the reason is we
have not taken account of the productivity growth, and some country’s GDP growth may rely more on one factor
growth.

5. Simulation Results
We next report our simulation results. In reality, China’s trade bargaining
partners are for now mainly developed countries. Even though they may change over
time with different country growth rates, we assume, for simplicity, that China will
always bargain with the OECD in all the years considered by our model. Both China
and its bargaining partner’s welfare gains from bargaining changes over time (from
2010 to 2100) and are computed using five different scenarios. These are from single
NBS bargaining with OECD; under KS bargaining solution concepts; for sensitivity
analysis of gains to elasticities; from China, India and Brazil jointly bargaining with
the OECD; and from bargaining after a PPP adjustment to China’s and other countries
size in the base case data. We report these welfare gains in three different ways: in
value, in shares and average annual growth rates of the gain. These values reflect
equation (13), and the shares reflect equation (14). The average annual growth rates of
the welfare gains from bargaining are calculated separately.
5.1 China’s gain over time under bargaining with OECD

We first report welfare gains for China from bargaining singly with the OECD
over time between 2010-2100 with estimates reported for each 10 year period. We
calculate non-cooperative equilibria and cooperative bargaining solutions for each
year, and then calculate bargaining gains. Table 5 presents these results for 10 yearly
intervals between 2010 and 2100.
Under Nash bargaining, in 2010 the share of the welfare gain for China is 41%
and the OECD gain is 59%. As China grows, its welfare gain share of the total welfare
23

gain for China and the OECD increases to 67.7% in 2050, with the OECD share
32.3%. In 2100, China gets 88.7% of the total welfare gain and the OECD gets 11.3%.
It is thus clear that China’s welfare gain from bargaining will increase over time.

The welfare gain China receives from NB is 111.6 in 2010, 2313.8 in 2050 (a
more than 20 times increase), and 84980 in 2100 which is 761 times compared to
2010. The OECD has a utility gain of 160.4 in 2010, 1106.3 in 2050 which increases
6.9 times, and 10807.1 in 2100 which increases 67.4 times compared with 2010
(Figure 5). If we compare China’s welfare gain with that of the OECD, we find that in
2030 China’s welfare gain will exceed that of the OECD if all countries keep their
present GDP growth rates.

China’s share in 2010 is only 10.6%, much smaller than under NB. In 2040 it
increases to 53% and exceeds that of the OECD. In 2050 China’s share is 70.9% and
reaches 99.1% in 2100; much larger than NB. On the value side, China’s welfare gain
is 28.7 in 2010, 2424.3 in 2050 and 94921.4 in 2100; increasing about 84 times and
3307 times compared to results for 2010. OECD’s gain increases about 4 times by
2050 and 3.5 times in 2100 compared to 2010. These growth factors are much larger
25

for China under KS than NB, but much smaller for ROW. From the growth results,
China’s welfare gain grows rapidly in the early years and gradually grows more
slowly in later years. The OECD gain growth rate is also comparatively higher in the
early years, but becomes negative after 2070.

When we compare welfare gains for China and OECD using the KS and NB
solution concepts, we find that before 2050, China’s welfare gains under NBS are
more than under KS, and OECD’s welfare gain under NBS is less than under KS. But
after 2050, gains for both China and OECD change to the opposite relationship
(Figure 7). Welfare gain variation trends do not change under different solution
concepts.
We next compare both China and OECD welfare gain shares and growth rates
under different bargaining solution concepts. These results are reported in Figure 8.
Share results are the same as for values, and before 2050 China shares are more under
NBS but after 2050 China’s share is more under KS. The growth rates of welfare
26

gains change a lot for both China and OECD. They are both larger before 2050 and
become less after 2050. For the OECD, its growth rate becomes negative after 2070.

These sharp differences in results across these different solution concepts are
especially interesting since this different numerical behavior of the concepts has not
been noted in previous literature and has a seemingly intuitive explanation; a link in
our view which affects the relative attractiveness of the two solution concepts. For the
KS case, welfare gains reflect bargaining by comparing maximal utility along the
utility possibility frontier. As China grows and especially in later years after 2050,
there is an asymmetric shift in the utility possibility frontier and its maximal utility
will increase much more than the OECD. Under KS, therefore, China will receive
most of the welfare gain. Under NBS, the product of each partner’s utility gain is
maximized. This allocates the total welfare gain by region without paying attention to
the asymmetric utility possibility frontier shift. Thus China’s welfare gain after 2050
27

is much less under NB than under the KS solution concept.
These different bargaining results thus give sharply different values showing a
major numerical difference in bargaining solution concepts between NBS and
KS-solutions. As we indicate above, these sharp differences in numerical behavior
have not been noted in existing research literature.

5.3 The Sensitivity of China’s Bargaining Gains to Elasticities
We check the sensitivity of China’s and OECD’s welfare gain values to
elasticities in single China-OECD Nash bargaining in this part. These results can help
us assess the robustness of our simulation results.

Note: For simplicity, we just change elasticities in the last simulated non-cooperative equilibrium utility and
NBS utility stage to check the sensitivity of each bargaining country’s welfare gains. We have not recalibrated the
model as elasticities change, and have not changed the elasticities in computing non-cooperative equilibria import
tariffs and NB solutions.
Source: Calculated by the authors.

We change all of the elasticities in production and consumption for each country
28

simultaneously from 1.2 to 2.8. Results are presented in Table 7.
It is clear that as elasticities increase, China’s welfare gain value will increase
and the positive trend has not changed; in the meanwhile, OECD’s welfare gain value
also increases as elasticities increase except when elasticities are equal to 1.6.
Additionally China’s welfare gain share has nearly no change in every year under
each elasticity value. This suggests that our simulation results are robust and credible.
5.4 Welfare Gains When China, India and Brazil Jointly Bargain with the
OECD

China and other developing countries’ trade partners are mostly developed
countries, and they often have trade disputes with developed countries. Thus, if China
can join with other large developing countries to jointly bargain with the OECD, it
will increase China’s bargaining power and yield more welfare gains.
In this part we assume China joins with India and Brazil to jointly bargain with
the OECD and then simulate their welfare gains. It is complicated to deal with four
way bilateral bargaining, so we compute two-person bargaining solutions to simplify
the calculation. We add China, India and Brazil together as one country, and this one
bigger country bargains with the OECD. After we get the Nash equilibrium import
tariff rates, we separate these countries again to compute each country’s welfare gain
from the bargaining.
We show the welfare gain results in this case in Table 8. For the welfare gain
share, China’s share in 2010 is 40.5%, 64.2% in 2050 and 79.2% in 2100; this exceeds
the OECD share in 2020. China receives most of the welfare gain, and then comes the
29

OECD, but after 2080 India’s gain is also more than that of the OECD. Trends in
welfare gain changes for each country are the same as for the shares. For the annual
average growth rate, China’s and India’s growth rates are both higher than the
OECD’s in all of the years.

We compare welfare gain values for China and the OECD under single NB with
30

values under Joint NB in Figure 9. The results show that China will benefit more from
joint bargaining in all years, and China’s welfare gain will increase about 40% under
jointly bargaining. OECD’s welfare gain value shows nearly no change. Although the
OECD suffers from China’s improved bargaining power it can also gain from the
import tariff reductions by India and Brazil.

We compare the welfare gain growth rate for China and the OECD under NB in
Figure 10. These results reveal that China’s gain growth rates under joint bargaining
are higher than under single bargaining except in the year 2020. This means that
China has benefitted from joint bargaining in terms of gain growth. OECD’s gain
growth rate in the early years before 2060 is reduced by joint bargaining, but it also
benefits from joint bargaining after 2060. The reason may be that as China and India
become larger, the OECD can also benefit from their increased economic scale and
demand.
5.5 China’s Gain Over Time from Bargaining Under PPP
31

A widely argued idea is that China’s foreign exchange rate has been undervalued
and that the RMB’s real currency purchasing power is higher than its market rate
measure. Therefore if we adjust China’s economic scale with PPP (Purchasing Power
Parity) to simulate bargaining welfare gains, China’s gain may increase more. We
choose a PPP conversion factor from the World Bank world development indicator
database to adjust China’s economic size in base case data. From this database, the
conversion indicator of US$/RMB¥ is 4 in 2008, not 6.83 as for the nominal exchange
rate. After adjusting China’s economic scale for PPP and adjusting the benchmark
data set and recalibrating the model, we compute bargaining solutions and welfare
gains again and show the results in Table 9.

These results suggest that China’s welfare gains from bargaining will exceed
those of the OECD in 2030; and China’s share will reach 69.3% in 2050 and 89.2% in
2100. China’s welfare gain values increase separately by about 21 times and 752
times in 2050 and 2100 compared with 2010. For the welfare gain growth rate, China
averages 10.8% and the OECD average is about 5.9%.
Figure 11 compares welfare gains both for China and the OECD under PPP with
gains under the market foreign exchange calculation. We find that both country
32

welfare gain values have increased, and China’s gain has increased by about 37%.
This implies that China’s increased scale has benefitted both itself and the OECD in
absolute welfare gain from bargaining.

Figure 12 presents comparisons of China’s and OECD’s gain shares and growth
33

rates under PPP with results using market exchange rates. An apparent trend is the
PPP adjustment to China’s economic scale which increases China’s gain share and
decreases the OECD’s gain share. OECD’s gain growth rates also decline after PPP
adjustment, but China’s gain growth rates increase before 2060 but decrease after
2060 compared to results without PPP adjustment.

6. Concluding Remarks
We use a five country, two goods two factors per country general equilibrium
model to numerically compute trade bargaining solutions and calculate China’s
welfare gains from bargaining over time between 2010 and 2100 under different
scenarios. Our findings are as follows.
Firstly, China’s welfare gains from bargaining with the OECD increases over
time if its GDP keeps its present high growth rate. By 2030 China’s gain will exceed
that of the OECD. China’s share of the global welfare gain from cooperative Nash
bargaining in 2010 is 41%, and increases to 54.8% in 2030, 67.7% in 2050 and 88.7%
in 2100. China’s average annual growth rate of welfare gains from bargaining is about
11%, a little higher than its GDP growth rate. OECD’s gain growth rate is about 6%,
much higher than its GDP growth rate, which suggests China’s high growth will
benefit the OECD.
Second, under the KS-solution concept, China’s welfare gains from bargaining
decrease before 2050 but increase later (after 2050) compared with NBS. The OECD
is the contrary case. China’s welfare gain share in 2010 under the KS-solution is just
10.6% but reaches 99.1% in 2100. Both countries show a gradually slower annual
average growth rate, especially for the OECD, its growth rate after 2060 becomes
negative. These results allow us to compare differences in numerical behavior for
different solution concepts for NBS and KS-solution, which has not been done in
previous literature.
Third, when China joins with India and Brazil to jointly bargain with the OECD,
35

its welfare gains from bargaining increase by about 40% compared with single
bargaining results, and the annual average growth rate of its welfare gain increases to
about 11.4%, a little higher than under single country bargaining. In the meanwhile,
OECD’s welfare gains show almost no reduction compared with single bargaining
results. Therefore, it is a useful strategy for China to join with other developing
countries to improve its bargaining power.
When we use PPP to adjust China’s economic scale, its welfare gains from
bargaining increase about 37% compared with the results without a PPP adjustment;
and China’s annual average growth rate of its welfare gain is about 10.8%, nearly the
same as without PPP adjustment. These results suggest that China’s welfare gains
from bargaining will be larger if we take account of purchasing power parity.
