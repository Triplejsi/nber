Expected Fiscal Policy and the Recession of 1982

ABSTRACT

The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 had one aspect that is
unusually useful for economic analysis. It provided an example of a
clear—cut announcement of future policy actions at specified dates.
This provides an opportunity to apply recent advances in the analysis
of expectations dynamics to data that have been generated in an environment that includes such announced and anticipated policy action.
A three—stage future tax cut was announced in the Tax Bill in March
1981. In a Keynesian model with liquidity—constrained consumers or
investors, or with uncertainity, this would normally be expected to provide
a stimulus to the economy when the tax cuts actually appear. But the financial markets could look ahead to the stimulus and the shift in the
high—employment deficit brought about by the tax cuts, and their implications for bond prices and interest rates. In this paper we argue that
this happened during the first half of 1981. As market participaits came
to understand that the tax and budget actions of March 1981 implied a
future shift of the high—employment——now "structural" —— deficit by some
5 percent of GNP, they revised their expectations of future real interest
rates upward. This caused a jump in real long—term rates then, in 1981.
And, it also caused a sudden and unanticipated real appreciation of the
dollar at the same time. The jump in real long—term interest rates and
the dollar appreciation in the first half of 1981 were essential features
of the recession that began in July 1981.

This paper points out the possibility of a purely anticipatory
recession. If the only policy action had been the fiscal announcement,
and if goods markets are "Keynesian" but financial markets are forward—
looking, the announcement can cause a recession, which will end when
the actual fiscal action begins to stimulate the economy. In the actual
context of 1981, a shift toward monetary tightness also contributed to
the recession.

I. Introduction
The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 had one aspect that is

unusually useful for economic analysis. It provided an example of a
clear—cut announcement of future policy actions at specified dates.
This provides an opportunity to apply recent advances in the analysis
of expectations dynamics to data that have been generated in an environment that includes such announced and anticipated policy action.
A three-stage future tax cut was announced in the Tax Bill in March

1981. In a Keynesian model with liquidity—constrained consumers or
investors, or with uncertainty, this would normally be expected to provide

a stimulus to the economy when the tax cuts actually appear. But the
financial markets could look ahead to the stimulus and the shift in the

high—employment deficit brought about by the tax cuts, and their implica-

tions for bond prices and interest rates. In this paper we argue that
this happened during the first half of 1981. As market participants came
to understand that the tax and budget actions of March 1981 implied a
future shift of the high—employment——now tstructuralv__deficit by some
5 percent of GNP, they revised their expectations of future real interest

rates upward. This caused a jump in real long—term rates then, in 1981.
And, we argue in section V below, it also caused a sudden and unanti-

cipated real appreciation of the dollar at the same time. The jump in
real long—term interest rates and the dollar appreciation in the first

half of 1981 were essential features of the recession that began in July
1981.

This paper points out the possibility of a purely anticipatory

recession. If the only policy action had been the fiscal announcement,

and if goods markets are "KeynesianT' but financial markets are forward—

looking, the announcement can cause a recession, which will end when

the actual fiscal action begins to stimulate the economy. In the actual
context of 1981, a shift toward monetary tightness also contributed to
the recession.

The models we use to analyze these policy changes have many ante-

cedents. Wilson (1979) analyzed the effect of anticipated policies in
Dornbusch's (1976) model of expectations and exchange rate dynamics.
Buiter and Miller (1984, and references therein) have used similar models
to analyze the theoretical effects of disinflation policies, as well as

the actual events of the Thatcher period. Miller (1980) and Blanchard
(1981) have constructed closed—economy models which include an expecta—
tional term—structure of interest rates, and are simple enough to be

treated analytically. In particular, the initial model of section III
begins with Marcus Miller's (1980) four—equation closed—economy model,
and we have benefitted greatly from discussions with him on this topic
(and many others).

The paper is structured as follows. In section II we begin with
some "stylized facts" about the recession. The important things to notice
are the sharp rise in real long—term interest rates and the real appreciation of the dollar in early 1981, and the subsequent split of financing

of the budget deficit between domestic saving and foreign borrowing——the
current account balance.
Section III begins by incorporating a term structure based on expectations of future movements in interest rates into a standard fixed—price

closed—economy IS—LM model. This is the model of Miller (1980). In it
the short—term rate moves along the LM curve, but the long—term rate

3

follows a positively—sloped saddle path. This framework shows clearly
the principles involved in analyzing expectations dynamics. We then
proceed to add a model of core inflation and a short—run Phillips curve
in order to incorporate price dynamics.

The open—economy version of the model is presented in section IV,
with equations for the current account and an "open interest parity"
condition with exchange—rate expectations and a risk premium that

depends on the stock of government debt. This reflects our assumptions
that dollar—dominated and foreign—exchange assets are imperfect substitutes so that U.S. interest rates can move relative to foreign rates.
The open—economy model shows how the anticipated fiscal package could
cause a jump in the real long—term rate and the dollar, splitting the
financing between domestic investment and the current account.

The effects of a pre—announced temporary fiscal expansion in the

open—economy context are discussed in section IV. This presents both
the dynamics of the open—economy model and rounds out our stylized

analysis of the recession. The fiscal expansion must be temporary to
keep the government debt from going off to infinity in our stationary

model. In section V we see the pattern of a jump up in the long—term
interest rate and a jump down (appreciation) in the exchange rate when

the fiscal package is announced. Then the exchange rate must depreciate
in the long—run equilibrium after the fiscal package is reversed, but

U.S. interest rates remain permanently higher than those abroad, due to
an increase in the exchange risk premium.

II. Economic Policies and the Unusual Characteristics of the 1982 Recession
The 1982 U.s. recession coincided with major shifts in monetary and

fiscal policies. In this section we will present a brief description of
the main policy changes, as well as of the corresponding movements in some

key endogenous variables. In particular, we will focus on the financing
of the deficit, and on the behavior of prices, production, interest rates,
and the exchange rate.

In March of 1981 the new budget and tax package was announced. It
included a major increase in defense spending to be phased in over several
years, a three—stage tax cut to begin in 1982, and some cuts in non—defense

spending. The package as a whole implied a growing "structural" deficit
in the Federal Government's budget from $40 billion in the first half of

1981 to about $180 billion by the end of 1984. The financing of the overall government deficit can be seen in Table 1. As required by the national
income identity, a budget deficit must be financed by a combination of
excess domestic saving over domestic investment, and a current account

deficit (net foreign saving). Until the third quarter of 1982 most of the
deficit was financed by net domestic saving. Investment fell from a peak
of $495.8 billion in 1981:3 to $377.4 billion in the last quarter of 1982.
In 1983, however, as the recovery gained momentum and the dollar continued
to appreciate, a larger share of the deficit began to be financed by
foreign saving.

Unlike fiscal policy, it is harder to characterize monetary policy in

this period of financial innovation and deregulation. Even though the
monetary authorities made explicit their intention of reducing inflation,
the main monetary indicators did not exhibit signs of larger policy shifts.

The growth rate of the money supply (Ni as currently defined) decreased
from an annual rate of 8.3% between 1976.3 and 1979.3 to 6.1% between

1979.4 and 1982.3. In particular, from the second quarter of 1981 to the
third quarter of 1982 Ni grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%. Finally,
if we correct the money supply for the introduction of NOW accounts on
December 31, 1980, we find that for the year 1981 the adjusted figure drops
from 6.4% to 2.3%, indicating a severe monetary squeeze.

The behavior of the main macroeconomic variables in this period is

summarized in Table 2. By mid—1981 nominal short—term interest rates had
risen by about 5 percentage points over mid—1980, and long—term rates by

3.5 points, even as the inflation rate began to decline. In the third
quarter of 1981 the recession began, and short rates dropped slightly.
Long rates, however, remained high, a fact that we will discuss at length

below. Almost simultaneously with the announcement of future fiscal
policy and the rise in interest rates, the dollar started its appreciation,

which has continued to the end of 1984. The recession began in the third
quarter of 1981 and ended in the fourth quarter of 1982, with a decline in
industrial production of about 11.5%.

If tight money were the sole cause of the recession, we would have

expected to see the short—term interest rate remain above the long—term
rate. However, since the fourth quarter of 1981, the short rate has been
below the long rate. The severity of the recession, the inversion of
the term structure of interest rates, and the appreciation of the dollar
in recession are the puzzle that we attempt to solve in the next three
sections, focusing on expectations dynamics and future fiscal policy.

III. The Basic Model, Closed Economy
We begin the exposition with the simplest fixed—price IS—LM model

of a closed economy. The basic idea of how expectations dynamics in
financial markets can generate a recession from an expected fiscal expansion can be easily outlined in this framework. Then we will go on to price
dynamics and open—economy aspects of the model.

IS—LM with Short— and Long—Term Interest Rates
The basic model can be stated in four equations:

d=ay+i+pf—(R—h): ISCurve,

r = (Ty —

= iJJ(d —

r:

Path of Long Rate, or Term Structure.

Variable definitions are given in Table 3. Equation (1) gives
aggregate demand d as a function output y, autonomous investment i, the
exogenous component of fiscal policy f, and the real long—term (actually

consol) bond rate. Expenditure is assumed to be a function of current
income, in Keynesian fashion. This is clearly an important assumption
for our analysis of fiscal policy. If infinitely—lived consumers take
into account fully all future tax liabilities, including those related
to debt service, then a shift from tax—financing to debt—financing of

government spending will have no effect on aggregate demand. See Barro
(1974) for a discussion of this case. For a variety of reasons such as
liquidity constraints, the difficulty of increasing construction demand, and
supply, quickly as future returns increase, and uncertainty regarding remaining
years of life (see Blanchard, 1984), we think the neutrality assumption is too

strong. The expected, or 'core" inflation rate h is given exogenously in equation (1), and set at zero for the time being. It will be endogenized later.
Equation (2) is the LM curve normalized on the short—term interest rate

r. The short rate is assumed to clear the money market at all times. In
the LM curve m is real balances M/P, and E

is

the semi—elasticity of the

demand for money with respect to r. Equation (3) gives the change in
output over time as a partial adjustment to the excess of demand over

output. A more precise model would include inventory dynamics, but the
specification here is sufficient to maintain a focus on expectations.
Equation (4) specifies the term structure of interest rates, providing one link with the future, and thus bringing expectations dynamics

into the model. Aside from a risk premium, which we set to zero, any
long—short differential must be equal to the expected rate of change of

the long rate. If R —

r

> 0 in equation (1), then the long rate must be

expected to rise (i.e. consol price to fall) to generate a capital loss
that offsets the rate differential, for the bond market to be in equilibrium.

The dynamics of the model are described in the IS—LN diagram of

Figure 1. The short—term rate r and the long—term rate R are measured on
the vertical axis; output is on the horizontal axis. The stationary
equilibrium is at point E, where R =

r

and d =

y.

Away from equilibrium,

y and R move along the "saddle path" RR, and r moves along the LM curve.

The innovation in Figure 1 is the RR saddle path. This comes from
the combination of equation (4) and the assumption of rational expecta-

tions in financial markets. In this non—stochastic model, rational
expectations is the same as perfect foresight. Output adjusts toward the

L

S

IS curve, following equation (3). This gives the horizontal arrows in
Figure 1. The short—term rate clears the money market, so it moves along
the LM curve following output.

The RR saddle path can be derived as follows. If the long rate R
were to adjust along the LM curve, ER would be zero throughout, from equation (4) with R =

r.

This is inconsistent with rational expectations; to

the left of E, r and R are expected to rise and to the right of E to fall.
Therefore, to the left of E, for example, with ER > 0, R must exceed r.

This gives the vertical arrows that show the motion of R. If R is above
LM, R >

r

and E. must be positive for equilibrium between short and long

rates; vice versa below LM. There is then only one saddle path RR that is
consistent with a rational expectations equilibrium. It is positively
shaped but flatter than LM. Along it, to the left of point E, ER = R —

r

> 0

and to the right of E, it is negative. Other paths of R,y are "bubble" paths
that cross IS vertically (y = 0) or LM horizontally (ER =

0) and explode to

the northwest or southeast. These "unstable branches" will play an important
role in the analysis of anticipated fiscal policy.

Unanticipated Monetary and Fiscal Policy
As a prelude to an analysis of the 1982 recession, we can use the
diagram of Figure 1 to characterize the effects of unanticipated monetary
or fiscal policy on demand and the term structure of interest rates.

This is the usual textbook case. Consider first the effects of a contrac—
tionary monetary policy (dM <

0),

illustrated in Figure 2. The LM curve

shifts up, so the equilibrium moves from point A to point B. At the
initial level of income a' the two interest rates rise to r1, R1 with

13

with the short rate above the long. As y falls, the two interest rates
also fall, converging to point B.

The effect of an unanticipated fiscal expansion is shown in Figure 3.

Again the equilibrium point moves from A to B. With y at 7a' initially
the short rate remains at r .
a

But in anticipation of the future rise in

both rates, the long rate jumps to R. As output then rises to 'b' both
interest rates rise to Rb,

tb

Expected Fiscal Policy
The Reagan Administration's future budget package, which implied a

rising structural deficit, was announced in March 1981. The potential
recessionary effects of an announcement of a future fiscal expansion are

illustrated in Figure 4. With the economy at point A, a future fiscal
expansion is announced. The financial markets come to understand that
the future equilibrium is at point C, with higher interest rates. This

means the long rate will jump immediately. But onto what path? The
future saddle path will be RR at the time of the actual fiscal expansion.

The long rate will rise seeking an unstable branch relative to the exist-

ing equilibrium A that has the following property: as the economy moves
along that unstable branch, it will reach the new saddle path at the
time the announced fiscal expansion actually takes place, i.e., when equi—
librium C comes into existence.

Thus the long rate jumps to R1 in Figure 4 with output at

depresses investment and sends the economy into recession along the

unstable branch from point 1 to point B. Output and the short rate fall

to b' rb while the long rate rises to

expansion occurs, the recovery begins. Output increases from b to
with the short and long rates rising to converge to C. The financial
marketTs anticipation of the future fiscal expansion raises the present
long—term interest rate and throws the economy into an anticipatory
recession.

Anticipation of the future effects of the 1981 budget and tax package

cannot be the only cause of the 1982 recession, however. In Figure 4,
the long rate rises and the short rate falls in the recession, and the

short rate is below the long rate throughout. However, in the data of
Table 2 we see that the short rate rose above the long rate in late 1979
and again from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the third quarter of 1981,

after which it has remained below the long rate. So current tight
monetary policy in 1980—81 must also be part of the story.

Tight Money and Anticipated Fiscal Ease
To explain the movements in the term structure in 1980—84, as well
as the recession and recovery, we need a scenario that combines a monetary
policy tightening in 1981 with the effects of anticipated fiscal ease.
In fact, growth of Ml slowed to 5½

percent,

annual rate, from December

1980 to July 1982, so this may be a fairly accurate scenario.

The combination of an actual tightening of monetary policy and an

anticipated easing of fiscal policy is illustrated in Figure 5. For
expositional convenience, we assume there that the two policies have an
offsetting effect on demand in the final equilibrium, that is, that after
the recession and recovery, real GNP is back to its initial level relative to trend.

In Figure 5, the shift of the LM curve is current and unanticipated,

while the IS shift is announced for the future. This creates a new current equilibrium at point B, and a future equilibrium at point D with a

saddle path RR into it. At the initial level of income y, the short
rate jumps to rd on the new LM curve. The long rate rises, seeking the
unstable branch relative to the new equilibrium B that will take the

economy to RR when the IS curve actually shifts. So the long rate rises
to point 1 to put the economy on the recessionary path from 1 to C.
Now we see that initially the short rate moves above the long rate.

In the recession, as y falls from y to y the short rate falls along the
LN curve to r, moving below the long rate at the bottom of the latter's
path from 1 to C. The economy bottoms at point C when the actual fiscal
stimulus comes on line. During the recovery period the two rates rise,
converging to pOint D.

The essential feature of this scenario is the reversal of the term

structure. At first short rates rise above long rates, and then fall
below them, bottoming when the recession bottoms. Then in the recovery
both rise with the long rate above the short. This is essentially the
pattern of the data of Table 1. In the fourth quarter of 1980 the short
rate jumped above the long rate. The crossover came in the first quarter
of 1982, and the short rate remained below the long rate after that,

bottoming with the recession in the fourth quarter of 1982. Both rates
rose after that. Thus the scenario of an actual monetary tightening
combined with anticipated fiscal ease is consistent with the broad movements of the term structure and GNP.

Price Dynamics

The next step is to add price dynamics to the model. We adopt a
model of "core inflation," in which inflation adjusts gradually to

monetary disturbances and is also sensitive to output disturbances. We
use this model to reflect the idea that inflationary expectations are

adaptive, rather than forward—looking. In our specification, the inflation rate is a geometric average of past money growth rates. This can be
taken to represent a credibility effect, where a policy change is not
immediately assumed to be permanent, as well as an element of stickiness
on the supply side, such as would be implied by staggered wage contracts.

People believed in the early 1980s that inflation was coming down only
when they saw it come down.
The inflation equations are two:

(5)
(6)

h = Tr(M
=

—

h)

Adjustment of Core Inflation,

:

h + y — y)

:

Phillips Curve.

Equation (5) has the core inflation rate h adapting to deviations of

money growth from h

Equation (6) says the actual inflation rate is the

core rate plus a Phillips—curve term for deviations of output from its
natural level y.

For solutions of the dynamic model we will turn to computer simula-

tion in future research. But the solution algorithm for the dynamic
closed—economy model is clear. The ISLN equilibrium is on a trend

inflation rate given by M. Core inflation is M so h in (5)
is zero. Equilibrium output is ,

so

in (6)

is equal to h.

Demand and output are equal so y in (3) is also zero, With R =

r

from

21

(4), we can solve (1) for R and then (2) for P. The saddle path into this
solution gives the motion of the real long—term interest rate R —

h.

The

jump in the long—term real interest rate over the first half of 1981, and
its continued upward movement since the bottom of the recession in the

fourth quarter of 1982 can be seen in the data in Table 2. The is consistent with an interpretation of Figure 5 as showing the path of the real
long—term interest rate.

IV. The Open Economy
In addition to the historically high level of long—term real interest
rates since the first half of 1981, the economy has experienced an appreciation of the dollar, in real effective terms, of some 30 percent since

then. The data, using the IMP's index, are shown in the fifth column of

Table 2. Since we define the exchange rate as U.S. dollars per unit of
foreign exchange, an appreciation means the real effective rate in Table 2

goes down. Again, the major movement in the exchange rate comes across
the first half of 1981, consistent with the movement of real interest rates.
To build this into the model, we have to open it up.

Trade Flows

We assume gradual adjustment of real net exports x toward an equi—
librium level

that is a function of competitiveness, domestic income,

and foreign income. Competitiveness is measured by the exchange rate
relative to the domestic price level (e/p), with the foreign price level

fixed at unity. The equations for trade flows are:

Gradual Trade Adjustment.

The partial adjustment model is used to reflect the assumption that ad-

justment of trade flows to changes in competitiveness takes time. Equation (1) should be rewritten to include the trade balance:

(1')

d =

ay + i + iif ÷

(R

—

h)

+ x.

Asset Markets
The central aspect of our model of exchange—rate determination is
imperfect substitutibility between assets denominated in U.s. dollars and

in foreign exchange. With imperfect substitutability, an accumulation of
U.S.—government debt can increase U.S. interest rates relative to "world"

interest rates by increasing the risk premium on U.S. bonds. With
rational expectations, financial markets can look ahead to this implication of a shift in the full—employment deficit, and move the interest
rate and exchange rate at the time when the implication becomes clear.
Imperfect substitutability and a risk premium that is positively
related to the bond stock are given by

(9)

Ee =

r

—

(r*

+ pb),

where e is the rate of change of the exchange rate, r and r* are the U.S.

and world short—term interest rates, and b is the real bond stock. This
is the standard open interest parity condition with a flexible exchange
rate and a risk premium.

23

The real bond stock accumulates as the non—monetized part of the
budget deficit, following

(10)

b =

f

— m —

mp,

where f is the current real deficit, m is the

growth rate of real

balances, and mp is the inflation tax. Agents in financial markets are
assumed to look ahead to the consequences of shifts in f or b through equation
(10).

With perfect foresight, equation (9) says that the current level of
the exchange rate must reflect the integral of future expected interest

differentials, adjusted for the risk premium. In the solution of the
open—economy model, agents look ahead to the path of r —

r*

- pb.

Throughout the analysis, we hold r* constant. If this integral is positive, the expected value of e must be positive, so the current exchange
rate must fall below its equilibrium value given the current fundamentals.
Thus for sufficiently small p, the announcement of a future fiscal deficit
combined with a current shift to tighter monetary policy, by increasing
the expected future short—term interest rate, will yield an appreciation

of the dollar, at the time of the announcement. Buiter and Miller (1983)
give the forward integral of (9) as

(11)

e(t) =

(t) + JE(r* + pb(s) — r(s))ds,

where (t) is the current long—run equilibrium exchange rate. When the
expected integral becomes negative, e(t) falls relative to (t) so the
expected rate of increase of the exchange rate,e(t),is positive.

24

Long—run Equilibrium
The full open—economy model is summarized in Table 4. The long—run
equilibrium of the open—economy model can be solved as follows. From
equation (5) with h = 0, the core inflation rate is h = N, which is fixed

exogenously. From (6) with y =
From (3) with y =

0,

d =

y.

y,

p

h also, and m = N/p is constant.

In long—run equilibrium the real exchange

rate e/p will be constant, so

=

h =

i.

Combined with the long—run

bond stock b, this gives us the equilibriumvalue of the short rate r
from (9), and from (4) with R = 0, the long rate and the short rate are

equal. With M given exogenously, and y and r determined, the price level
P comes from money—market equilibrium (2), and the IS equation (1) can be

solved for net exports x. With x = 0 in (8),

=

x,

and finally equa-

tion (7) can be solved for the level of the nominal exchange rate e that

yields a real exchange rate (e/p) consistent with equilibrium x. This
completes the long—run equilibrium solution.

V. Dynamics of an Anticipated Temporary Fiscal Expansion
To study the dynamics of the open—economy model, we can use the

example of a pre—announced temporary fiscal expansion. This example,
supplemented at the end of this section by a reduction in money growth,

will also allow us to present our open—economy analysis of the recession

of 1982 and the subsequent recovery. The fiscal expansion must be
temporary so the real bond stock reaches a new long—run equilibrium

value rather than going off to infinity. So initially we consider the

example of a temporary pre—announced increase in f that creates a permanent increase in b, with no change in money growth.

Long—run Equilibrium
First we consider the effects on the long—run equilibrium, then

shorter—run dynamics. The assumption of no change in money growth fixes
long—run nominal growth rates

=h

=

stock and no change in the equilibrium ,

N.

r

With a larger real bond
and R must rise, from (9)

and (4). It is useful to note that from equation (9) with
long—run increase in r is equal to p

fixed the

b. Thus in the long—run equilibrium

there is no change in the integrand in equation (11). This implies that
if r rises above its long—run equilibrium value during the shorter—run
period of dynamic adjustment, the integral in equation (11) will be negative, implying a fall in e(t), an appreciation of the dollar, initially.
This rise in long—run equilibrium r means, from (2), that the entire

price path must rise to reduce real balances. With a higher real interest
rate R —

h,

net exports must rise, so e/p must rise. This implies that

the e path rises more than the p path. So in the long run interest rates
rise and the exchange rate depreciates, while in the short run interest
rates will rise even more, and the exchange rate will appreciate.

Announcement Effects and the Recession
We now shift the focus to the effects of the announcement of the

fiscal expansion. Essentially, we want to add the open—economy aspects
to the discussion of Figure 4. The announcement of the future fiscal

27

expansion creates the expectation that interest rates will rise.

This

means that ER in equation (4) becomes positive, and R jumps, as shown
in Figure 4.

The expectation that rates will rise to a point like C in Figure 4,
and remain high until the fiscal expansion is reversed, creates a

negative expected interest integral in equation (11). So in addition
to the upward jump in R at the date of the announcement, e jumps down,

i.e. the dollar appreciates. We interpret this to be the appreciation
shown in Table 2 across the first half of 1981.
The downward jump in e creates a jump appreciation of the real
exchange rate e/p, so net exports begin to fall through equations (7)

and (8). Thus the rise in the long rate R and the fall in e both
contribute to the recession by reducing investment and net exports.

Short—run Equilibrium
Now let us consider the shorter run equilibrium., while the
is in deficit, but y = d =

. In

budget

this short—run equilibrium, some

combination of an increase in the real interest rate (R —

h) and

decrease in (elp) are required in order to reduce investment and net

exports to make room for the increase in f. Total differentiation of
equation (1') with y and d given, p set at unity, and (7) for x results
in

(12)

'idf — SdR

+ de = 0.

In the R,e space of Figure 6, equation (12) is the LX curve with slope
G/cS and an upward shift when f increases. But in the short—run equl—

28

x

Figure 6: Short—run Adjustment with
Temporary Fiscal Expansion

29

librium r = R, and equation (11) says that if market participants expect
r to rise above its long—run equilibrium, the exchange rate will imme-

diately fall. This gives the negatively—sloped am (for asset markets)

line in Figure 6. The two conditions together give the increase in R
and decrease in e that split the financing of the f deficit between

investment and net exports in the short run. This is a partial explanation of the increase in real interest rates and appreciation of the dollar
that was shown in Table 2, in order to obtain the shift in the private
saving—investment balance and net exports that was shown in Table 1.

The Role of Slower Money Growth
Finally, let us add the assumption of an unanticipated reduction in
the money growth rate to complete the stylized description of the reces-

sion. An unanticipated discrete reduction in the money stock would give
the term structure inversion shown in Figure 2. But an unanticipated
reduction in money growth does not change the short—run recession
pattern significantly, because it enters the model only gradually via

h in equation (5). Eventually, it reduces the nominal growth rates by
the decrease in M.

In the long—run equilibrium, the addition of slower money growth
adds to the increase in the real bond stock b by reducing the inflation

tax in equation (10). This simply adds to the effect of the temporary
fiscal expansion. These effects all followed from the increase in the
real bond stock.

Thus to understand the pattern of movement of the term structure and
the exchange rate, as well as real output, during the recession, it is

30

sufficient (but clearly not necessary) to assume that there was a discrete
tightening of monetary policy in 1979, pushing short rates above long, and
an expectation of the fiscal deficit in 1981, accounting for the reversal

of the term structure. This pair of assumptions is sufficient in a model
that imposes rational expectations andmarket clearing in financial markets,

but not in goods or, implicitly, labor markets. These are assumptions that
we think are consistent with the real world that gave us the recession.
