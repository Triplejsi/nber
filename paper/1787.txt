The purpose of this paper is to explain price and output dynamics in an
open economy characterized by a monopolistic competitive market structure in

which pricing decisions incur costs. That lead producers to pre—set the price
path for several periods. The paper derives an optimal pricing rule,
including the optimal pre-setting horizon. It does so for a rational
expectation equilibrium, characterized by staggered, unsynchronized price

setting, for which the degree of staggering is endogenously determined. The
discussion focuses on the critical role of the degree of domestic-foreign
goods substitutability in explaining price and output effects of monetary and
real shocks.

Introduction1

Empirical studies have documented a remarkable difference between the

behavior of price levels and the exchange rate.2 The exchange rate between
the dollar and other reading currencies follows approximately a random walk

process3, whereas changes in goods prices are autocorrelated. As a result,
exchange rate innovations tend to be associated with shocks to relative
prices, implying persistent deviations from purchasing power parity (PPP
henceforth) .

Debate continues, however, on the economic interpretation of these
observations. Do they demonstrate that the PPP doctrine is irrelevant? Do
deviations from PPP follow a random walk?5 Almost any attempt to model
international transmission must use some version of the law of one price, and
the above empirical regularities raise question about the gap between such

regularities and current modeling strategies. Random, non-persistent
deviations from PPP can be readily explained in models that recognize the
potential role of transportation costs and other costs of' goods arbitrage.6

Thus, it is the persistency of observed deviations from PPP that raises doubts

regarding the usefulness of the PPP doctrine. There are two different
interpretations for deviations from PPP: first, as deviations from the law of
one price; next, as an index number problem. In other words, even if' the law
of one price holds for each good, the difference in consumption basket across
countries implies that changes in relative prices will result in deviations

from PPP. Clearly, the first interpretation causes more headaches in
explaining international transmission. This paper will concentrate on this
interpretation and, in order to simplify, will assume a one industry world.
The different behavior of the price levels and the exchange rate can be
explained in terms of models, like that of Dornbusch (1976), that recognize

-2-

the possibility of sluggish price adjustment in the goods market. In such an
economy, the exchange rate behaves as an asset price, adjusting

instantaneously to "news". The different speed of adjustment between the
goods and the asset markets implies that sustained shocks to the exchange rate
will result in persistent changes in relative prices.

An issue that deserves further exploration is the pricing rule used in

the goods market. This rule ultimately underlies the evolution of both the
real exchange rate and output. The purpose of this paper is to examine some
factors determining the pricing rule, and the implications of the pricing rule

for the adjustment path in response to nominal and real shocks. Specifically,
I postulate a stochastic monopolistic competitive economy, where pricing

decisions are carried out every several periods due to the presence of

transaction costs. These costs can reflect the expenses of collecting and
processing information as well as more costly consumer searches made necessary
by the presence of' more volatile prices. The price-setting decision periods

are assumed to be distributed uniformly over time. This distribution results
in price paths that differ across firms, according to the timing of their most

recent pricing decision. Following the construction of the building blocks
describing the economy, we drive the optimal pricing rule. Such a rule is
characterized by two elements. First, for a given frequency of pricing
decisions the firm needs to solve for the optimal path of prices to be pre—set

at the beginning of each pricing cycle. Second, the firm needs to solve for
the optimal frequency of pricing decisions.

Armed with the optimal pricing rule, I study in the next step the

implications for the aggregate economy. Specifically, I investigate the
adjustment of output, exchange rate and prices to nominal a'nd real shocks and

to what extent that adjustment depends on the market power enjoyed by each

—3—

producer.The discussion focuses on the relevance of the PPP doctrine and the
nature of the intermediate-run deviations from relative PPP. The doctrine of
relative PPP postulates that in a world of stable relative prices, exchange

rate depreciation should match inflation rate differentials.7 The paper
demonstrates that, in a market characterized by monopolistic competition and
costly pricing decisions, we obtain systematic deviations from relative PPP in
the intermediate run, although in the long run prices adjust according to the

relative PPP doctrine. The effective duration of the "intermediate run" is
shown to depend on the degree of substitutability of domestic and foreign

goods, and the volatility of the exchange rate. Both of these factors affect
the degree of price staggering. A larger degree of substitutability between
domestic and foreign goods would reduce the degree of monopoly power enjoyed

by each producer and thereby reduce the pre-setting horizon. Consequently,
the larger the degree of substitution, the lower is the degree of price

staggering. As a result, with perfect substitution we would approach a
flexible pricing equilibrium, where exact PPP would hold all the time. It is
important to note, however, that quite apart from the degree of goods

substitutability, relative PPP is shown to be the underlying long-run pricing
rule.

The analysis also shows that unexpected monetary shocks can generate
persistent aggregate output and relative price shocks, whose nature is
determined by the degree of substitutability of domestic/foreign goods.

There is a trade—off between price and output adjustment. A smaller
substitutability between domestic and foreign goods implies that a given
monetary shock induces a greater price shock but a smaller output shock.

Smaller substitutability is shown to be associated with a longer pricing

cycle. Thus, a greater degree of substitutability raises the magnitude but

_)4 —

reduces the duration of the output shocks resulting from a given monetary
innovation.

For simplicity of exposition, we focus in the paper on the pricing
strategy of domestic goods, assuming that imported goods can be supplied

elastically at a PPP price. This would be the case, for example, if each
agent could import foreign goods, priced at their PPP level, directly. An
alternative modeling strategy is to allow for a symetric treatment, in which
foreign goods are sold domestically only by dealers, each of which has limited

market power. In such an economy we would expect that the presence of gains
from reducing the frequency of pricing decisions would generate staggered

domestic prices for both domestic and foreign goods. The properties of such
an equilibrium are studied in Appendix B, which shows that, apart from the
added complexity, the deviations from PPP generated in such an economy are

similar to those analyzed in the paper itself. Appendix B also demonstrates
that the pricing cycle tends to be longer for home goods relative to the

duration of the pricing cycle of foreign goods. This finding is consistent
with empirical findings (see, for example, Katseli (19814)).

A growing body of current research has recognized the importance of a
limited degree of goods substitutability in explaining transmission of macro

shocks. Svennson (1985) takes this line of research in a closed economy
context, while Dornbusch (1985) and Giovannini (1985) address it in an open

economy framework. These authors study adjustment to macro shocks in a
monopolistic competitive economy, where some prices are pre—set one period

before the realization of shocks. A novel aspect of the present paper is in
assessing those questions in an economy characterized by a staggered,

unsynchronized price setting. An important element in the present analysis
will be the endogenous derivation of the degree of staggering, and the

—5—

emphasis on the role of the market power of sellers in determining the
persistency of deviations from PPP, and the induced output shocks.

Section 2 of the paper describes the model. It starts with a formulation
of the producer problem in a flexible price equilibrium. This equilibrium is
used as a benchmark for the equilibrium obtained in the presence of costs of

pricing decisions. The section ends by determining the rational expectation
equilibrium for the case of a stable covariance structure where pricing

decisions are made in an unsynchronized manner. Section 3 studies the
stochastic properties of prices and deviations from PPP. Section 1 adds the
money market equilibrium, analyzing the output effects of monetary shocks.
• Section 5 evaluates the adjustment of prices and output to real shocks.

Section 6 provides concluding remarks. Appendix A and B derive the optimal
pricing formulas and the pre-setting horizon.

In order to abstract from considerations concerning the labor market we

assume that the real wage in terms of the domestic product is given. To
simplify presentation, we neglect both the potential role of traded input in
the production process, and the possibility that labor is paid according to a

CPI index, reflecting the share of foreign goods. The country is taken to be
*

small enough to face a given foreign price, assumed to be unity (P 1) . The
only source of uncertainty is the exchange rate (in Sections 4-5 we will study
the adjustment to monetary and productivity shocks).

Several observations are in order. First,

Thus, in a flexible price equilibrium k diverges from § by a weighted
average that corresponds to the exchange rate (weighted by ) and to domestic
producer prices (each weighted by 6) .

This additive property corresponds to

the homogeneity postulate: an equi-proportional rise in all competitors'
prices raises

at the same rate. The parameter a corresponds to the

elasticity of demand with respect to the price of foreign goods. Notice that

as a approaches infinity,

approaches unity, while 6 and

approaches zero. Thus, at the limit of perfect substitutability we find an
exact version of PPP: that is, a given change in the (domestic currency
price) of foreign goods results in an equal change in the price of domestic
goods (in a flexible-price equilibrium).

If all domestic prices are flexible, our assumptions regarding domestic
producers imply that all producers will charge the same price,

We proceed by assuming the presence of gains from pre-setting the price

path for several periods. Those gains represent savings in the costs of
frequent collection and processing of new information as well as the cost of

changing prices)0 A related discussion, though in a different context, can
be found in Mussa (1981); Rotemberg (1982) and Sheshinski and Weiss (1977).

These authors consider the role of the cost of changing posted prices, whereas
the present analysis focuses on the role of fixed costs related to each

pricing decision. As a result, their analysis resulted in a policy of presetting a price for the relevant pricing horizon, whereas the present paper

sets a price path for the pricing cycle. This difference is relevant for the
rational expectation solution in a staggered pricing equilibrium.11

For simplicity of exposition, we focus in the paper on the pricing
strategy of domestic goods, assuming that imported goods can be supplied

elastically at a PPP price (p* E). This would be the case, for example, if
each agent could import foreign goods, priced at their PPP level, directly.
An alternative modeling strategy is to allow foreign goods to be sold
domestically only by domestic dealers, each of which has limited market

power. The properties of such an equilibrium are studied in Appendix B, which
shows that, apart from the added complexity, the deviations from PPP generated
in such an economy are similar to those analyzed in the paper.

Suppose that, due to the presence of gains from pre-setting the price

path, producers make a pricing decision each n periods (The economic
determination of n is studied in Appendix A). At the beginning of each
pricing cycle, a producer sets the price path for the next n periods. The

price in period d that was pre-set h periods ago is denoted by

For

example, a producer who starts a pricing cycle in period t should decide the

path of (p, p1, p1 )

Equation (7) corresponds to a rule that pre—sets

We assume a stable stochastic structure, and unsynchronized price

setting. Thus, at period t we can find n types of domestic producers,
differentiated only by the timing of their price pre-settirig decision.

Assuming a large number of identical domestic producers, whose price setting
decision periods are uniformly distributed over time, implies that at each

period there are m producer's who set the price path for the next n
periods, where 9./n = m

The resultant pre—setting rule is now specified by (12') and (lL).

Several observations are in order. P relative PPP pricing rule implies
equality between domestic price changes and the expected changes in the

exchange rate. This holds precisely for the pre—setting of prices n—i
periods ahead, (12'), where the price is set such as to equate the expected

relative price (p—e) to the "non—stochastic" equilibriuin3, _2_
implies that

This

is allowed to adjust fully to expected depreciation.h'

This pricing rule reflects the fact that a producer who pre—sets the price for

period t in period t-(n-i) (at level p1) is taking into account the
expected price of his competitors. His best estimate for the price that his

domestic competitors would charge at period t equals his own price. This
observation stems from the fact that the price of his domestic competitors

would deviate from his own price (p1) only by the innovations

ctJ

(n - 2

>,

j

>,

0) that are orthogonal to his present information set.

Consequently, a producer who pre sets prices for period t at period t—(n — 1)

would treat his domestic competitors symmetrically. This implies that the
pricing rule would follow the expected relative PPP version of equation (6),

as is shown by equation 12''. For a pre-setting horizon shorter than n—i
we obtain a pricing rule under which deviations from relative PPP reflect the
interaction between the market structure and inovations in the exchange

rate. For example, a producer who pre-sets the price for period t at
period t-(n-2) knows that some other producers have already set their price

in period t-(n-1) for t at the level p1 .

The producer has an

informational advantage relative to those that have already set their prices,
because he knows the innovation in the exchange rate

Ct(n.2) .

Using the

logic of footnote 15, he expects that the producers who have not yet pre-set

their price for period t to set it at the level that he sets. There are two

—1 L_

forces at work: on the one hand a larger substitutability with foreign goods

(larger a) encourages him to adjust his prices (relative to p1) by the

innovation, ct(n2) . On the other hand, a larger substitutability with
other domestic producers (8) discourages him from doing so because, by
adjusting his price by the innovation, he is likely to lose costumers to

producers who have preset their prices at period t-(n—1) (assuming
tt—(n—2) >0) . As is revealed by equation 13", the producer will adjust his

price by a portion a/(a+b) of the innovation, reflecting the relative strength

of these two forces. The expected relative PPP pricing rule would set

general, a smaller substitutability with foreign goods

and a shorter pre—setting horizon (i.e., smaller j in equation 114) will

their price for period n. Thus, there is a greater potential loss associated

with an attempt to adjust p according to £tj

Note that in the first part of the cycle the

exchange-rate shock represents a relative price shock, and there is high

degree of persistency in the resultant path of relative prices. At some
stage, however, we enter a second stage of the cycle, in which the shock to

relative prices dies down at an accelerated speed. A lower substitutability

between domestic and foreign goods (dcz<o) prolongs the first part of the
cycle, making the second part shorter. Consequently, the decay of the
relative price shock that takes place in the second period is more abrupt.16

This dependence of the path of relative prices on a can be shown to be
independent of the specific parameter values in this example. A possible
persistency measure is the duration of the time (relative to the cycle length, n—i)
needed to eliminate half of the effect of an exchange-rate shock on relative

the pre—setting horizon. At the limit of perfect substitutability (ci÷a) n
is shown to approach one, and relative PPP holds at all time. Thus, a
necessary condition for generating deviations from relative PPP is a limited

degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods. A lower

substitutability (dcz<o) will raise n and reduce a, implying that relative

prices e_ p will behave as a moving average of a higher order. For a
large n we might find that relative prices could be approximated by a loworder, autoregressive process, corresponding to the findings reported in

Frenkel (198la). Similarly, one can show that a higher substitutability among

Figure 3 summarizes simulation results, describing the dependence of optimal n
on the economic structure.18

The elasticity of average prices with respect to the exchange rate plays

a key role in the covariation of the exchange rate and relative prices. In
the presence of a longer pricing cycle, we find a tighter covariation. If
approaches zero, as would be the case for smaller degree of substitutability or smaller exchange rate volatility, most of the short-run variations
in relative prices can be explained by variations in the exchange rate.
As

gets smaller, the observer will tend to reject the PPP hypothesis.

Even for "intermediate" values of — ,

in

an economy continuously subject to

variations in the exchange rate, PPP would be frequently (almost always)

violated. But as our pricing rule (l) demonstrates, this observation is fully
consistent with a long-run view of PPP.

L. Output, Deviations From PPP and Monetary Shocks
The purpose of' this section is to assess the importance of degree of
goods substitutability in determining the output consequence of monetary

shocks. The resultant output shock is proportional to the induced deviation
from PPP. The discussion will identify two channels that link the degree of
goods substitutability to the output effect of a monetary shock. A lower
degree of goods substitutability will reduce, firstly, the responsiveness of
output to a monetary shock and secondly, will result in a longer goods prices
pre—setting horizon (n), and consequently in a higher degree of persistency of

output shocks. This raises the effective duration of the output shock induced
by a given monetary shock.

The analysis in the previous sections considered the exchange rate path
as being exogenously given, focusing on the resultant deviations from PPP.

—19—

Because the focus of this section is the link between monetary shocks and
deviation from PPP, it takes the path of monetary shocks as exogenously
given, solving for the resultant exchange rate and output path.

Let us define domestic output as the sum of the output of all produces

k1 t,k ,

and let Y° denote the non-stochastic output level (i.e., the

output level if all the stochastic shocks are zero). From equation 1 we
obtain that:

Thus, aggregate output deviates from its deterministic level in proportion to
the stochastic deviation from PPP, the factor of proportionality being the

degree of domestic/foreign goods substitutability. To further understand the
link between money and output, let us complete the money-market specification.
To simplify, let us take the simplest form of the demand for money:

Inspection of equations 29-30 reveals that a smaller degree of goods

Thus,

there is a trade-off between a price and a quantity adjustment. It is

lower goods substitutability raises optimal ri.

As is shown there,

This would prolong the outpit

effect of a given monetary shock. Thus, the degree of goods substitutability
has two opposing effects on the responsiveness of output to monetary shocks.

A higher degree of goods substitutability raises the magnitude but reduces the

duration of the output shock induced by a monetary innovation. At the
limiting case of perfect goods substitutabiltiy (a -* 1, a

output.

5. Output, Deviations From PPP and Real Shocks
The purpose of this section is to evaluate the path of adjustment to real

shocks. Suppose, -for example, that productivity varies over time. Thus, q in
equation 2 is subject to stochastic shocks, implying that the long—run

equilibrium relative prices ( , see equation 6 and footnote 13) change over

time. Let us denote by o the o

6. Concluding Remarks
The present paper has demonstrated that observable deviations from PPP
can be explained by the presence of optimally staggered prices in a monopo-

listic competitive economy. In such an economy, PPP holds as a long -run
proposition.

Among the limitations of the paper is the lack of a dynamic analysis of
the path that brought the economy into a symmetric staggered pricing

equilibrium. Suppose, for example, that weobserve in the present period an
unexpected change in the stochastic structure. We can expect such a change to
trigger a resetting of the price path by some producers. The tendency to
reset the price path should be stronger for those producers that had pre—set

prices most recently. Such an attempt would tend to destroy the initial non—
synchronized equilibrium. An interesting task would be to derive the
equilibrium path that corresponds to such an adjustment.

One of the key assumptions used in this paper concerns the timing of

pricing decisions. It was assumed that the various producers are distributed

uniformely over time, so that at each point in time a fraction () of the
producers determine the time path of prices. With this assumption the
complexity of the problem was reduced significantly. In practice, however, it
is evident that in many industries the pricing decisions are made at specific

considerations (like the season of the year, the end and the beginning of the

school year, and the like). Furthermore, it was assumed that each producer

sets price for precisely n periods. Again, in reality one typically
observes that the length of the pricing cycle differs across sectors in the

economy. Such considerations were not allowed in the present analysis, and
their incorporation would constitute a useful extension. Finally, since the
present paper modeled explicitly the behavior of various producers in a single
industry the analysis deals really with deviations from the law of one price
rather from the broader concept of purchasing power parity.

minimizing this last expression.

Appendix B

The analysis in the text focused on the pricing behavior of domestic
goods and assumed that foreign goods could enter the market priced at their

PPP level. The purpose of this Appendix is to analyze deviations from PPP in
an economy in which domestic prices of both foreign and domestic goods are

treated symmetrically: each seller pre—sets the price path for several
periods, resulting in a staggered price equilibrium for both domestic and

foreign goods. The discussion is intended to demonstrate that, apart from the
added complexity, the resultant deviations from PPP are similar to those
analyzed in the text.

Consider an economy composed of a large number of producers and dealers

selling foreign goods. Each of them is small enough to take the average
prices of domestic and foreign goods as given. Let us denote by

and

the corresponding domestic average price of domestic and foreign goods.
The demand facing a domestic producer (k) is given by:

—

(31)
k

where '

corresponds to the elasticity of demand with respect to the

price set by domestic competitors, whereas '

corresponds to the elasticity

of demand with respect to the price set by foreign competitors. Note that

represents

the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign

goods. Production technology is the same in this case as in the text:

-32-

(B2)

For simplicity

of' exposition we assume that labor is paid according to a domestic product

deflator (P)

Analogously, domestic dealer selling foreign goods priced at Pf faces a
demand given by
-

p

()

(33)

Invoking the small country assumption, we assume that each dealer can import

foreign

goods at a given international price, taken to be one (p

We solve this model as we did the model in the text. First, we derive
the flexibile price equilibrium. Then we study the equilibrium for the case
where domestic and foreign producers pre-set the price path for n and m
periods, respectively.

Profit maximization in a flexible equilibrium implies that dealers of
foreign goods would charge:

—3I—

Suppose now that, due to the presence of gains from pre—setting the price
path for several periods, domestic and foreign producers make pricing

decisions every n and m periods, respectively. Thus, they pre-set the price
path for n (and m) periods. Assuming that producers and dealers are risk
neutral, Appendix A demonstrated that a producer (or a dealer) that pre-set
the price for period t i periods ago will charge:

P= E. t

(B8)

Thus, the resultant price for foreign goods is:

E_1 e+ h

(B9)

Applying equations (B5) and (38) we find that a domestic producer that

pre—set prices at period t in a staggered, unsynchronized equilibrium will
set its price at:

We assume that the only source of uncertainty is the foreign exchange
rate, which follows the random walk process (equation 10).

—35-

For a given n and m we can solve for the pricing behavior. The
duration of the pricing cycle (n and m) is determined endogenously in a manner

described in Appendix A. The resultant deviations from PPP will have
statistical properties similar to those described in the text. For example,

A comparison between equation B14 and equation 18 from the text reveals
that allowing for a symmetric treatment of the pricing of both domestic and
foreign goods does not affect the nature of the resultant deviations from
PPP. These follow a path similar to the one described in figures 2—3.
The case of equal degrees of price staggering (n

m) is useful as a

benchmark for the assessment of the relative duration of the pricing cycle of

each class of goods. As is shown in Appendic A, a rise in volatility reduces
the length of a pricing cycle. As equation A9 shows, the appropriate
volatility measure is the expected (squared) discrepancy between the pre—set

price and the corresponding flexible price [Et(ph -

follows we compare this volatility measure as it relates to home and foreign goods

(sold domestically).23 This comparison is conducted for the case where m

n.

With equal pre—setting horizon (h), this volatility measure is shown to be
larger for traded goods, implying that the benchmark case where m

n is

suboptimal. Thus, the presumption is that the pricing cycle is longer for
domestic goods.

Applying B4 and 9 we find that for foreign goods, sold domestically:

Notice that an exchange rate innovation

affects 315 by means of a

unitary coefficient, whereas it affects 916 at a lower rate
(because

)

Consequently, the volatility measure that is

relevant for the assessment of the costs of pre-setting prices is higher for

foreign goods (sold domestically). Thus, domestic production tends to
mitigate the drop in profits that results from exchange rate volatility,
implying a longer optimal duration of the pricing cycle of' domestic goods
relative to the pricing cycle of' foreign goods sold domestically.

and Deviations from PPP", NBER W. P. #1552), by studing the output and
price effects of real and monetary shocks.

Empirical evidence (Frenkel (198lb)) has shown that deviations from PPP
follow an AR(1) process, with an autocorrelation of .9, close enough to
unity such that one cannot reject the random walk possibility.

(19814).

Monopolistic competitive equilibrium in an open economy was studied by

Flood and Hodrick (1983). They focused on the role of inventory
adjustment in explaining the business cycle. Dixit and Stiglitz revived
the interest in monopolistic competition whereas Dornbusch (1976) revived

the interest in pre-set pricing models of floating exchange rates. On
monopolistic competition in the context of trade models see I-lelpman and
Krugman (1985).

To simplify, we neglect the role of fluctuations in present income in

determining the demand. Thus, our analysis corresponds to the case where
the demand is determined by the permanent income and the real interest

rate, both of which are assumed to be constant. In general, we can
further enrich the analysis by allowing the demand to be a function of
both income and relative prices.

10. We consider the case where the we do not allow for pre-set prices

contingent on future (presently unavilable) information. At the extreme
case, where we would make optimal use of all future information in a

contingent pricing system, we would converge on the flexible equilibrium

economy, described earlier. This paper does not attempt to provide a
theoretical justification for the existence of non-contingent prices.
Rather, their existence is taken for granted, and the present work
attempts to analyze the statistical properties of the resultant

deviations from PPP. For studies on goods price rigidities, see Canton
(1979, 1985) and the references thereupon.

11. The present formulation is related toFischer (1977), who studies the
determinations of contracts in the presence of two-period staggered

contracts. The new aspect of the present discussion is in allowing for
endogenous determination of the extent of' staggering prices, focusing on

the role of the degree of substitutability between various goods and the
stochastic structure in explaining the nature of the resultant

equilibrium. Our approach is closer to Fischer (1977) than to Taylor
(1979), who considers a staggered equilibrium that sets one price for the

pre—setting horizon, which is taken to be exogenously given. The issues
addressed in this paper can be casted in terms of Taylor's framework,

where each pricing decision set a price (and not a price path). This

paper apply Fischer's formulation because it allows for a more tractable

analysis regarding the role of goods substitutability in the
determinations of the optimal frequency of pricing decisions and the
implied path of the purchasing power ratio.

12. The random walk choice is motivated by the empirical regularities
observed in the last decade.

enabeling a more flexible output adjustment to shocks to relative prices. This
has the effect of reducing the costs associated with pre-set prices, prolonging
the length of the pricing cycle.

21. The problem of an optimal pre-setting horizon is related to the question of
optimal labor contract length, as addressed by Gray (1978). A new aspect of
the present discussion is the focus on the role of' market structure (degree of

goods substitutability) and the presence of endogenous staggered prices.
