I. INTRODUCTION
Consider a class of similar securities with differing maturities, each
involving

an initial investment at time zero and providing a single known

payment at maturity. Let flu) denote the yield to maturity so that $1.00
invested now would return an amount expim R(a)) at time a. We will be

interested in the long term behavior of this yield curve R(m) for large a,
and, in particular, in the approach of R(m) to its asymptotic value.
The forward rate function r(a) describes the (instantaneous) rate of
return of a very short term investment at time ii in the future which might be
represented by a portfolio defined by selling securities which mature at time
m and buying an equal (in present value) amount which mature at time m + £.
Standard

relationships (for example, Malkliel 1966, or Nelson 1972) represent
the yield and forward rates in terms of one another:

of (1.1) suggest. that P(m) might decay towards its asymptotic

value at a rate c/rn for some constant c because short and medium term

behavior of the forward rate will tend to persist at a rate 1/rn in the
averaging process.

Our primary objective is to show that this reciprocal

happen under fairly general assui.ptions and to propose a graphical

technique based on these conclusions for examining long—term yields in actual

data.

These results may be interpreted in the context of the Expectations

Hypothesis, which states that the forward rates represent the yields expected
at future time
soae

very

periods.

Even if these expectations decay quickly towards

long term value, the yield curve will decay slowly due to the

persistence of earlier forward rate changes in the averaging process (I.!).

Moreover, the yields will tend to decay like the reciprocal of the time to
maturity and will not directly reflect the rate of decay of the expectations

of future yields. A discussion of the Expectation Hypothesis and the term
Structure of interest rates may be found in Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981).

2. ASSUMPTIONS AND RESULTS.
We will require two assumptions. The first will guarantee existence of
an asymptotic yield while the second will guarantee that the approach to this

asymptotic value does not proceed too slowly. Precisely, the first
assumption is that the forward rate has a finite limiting value:
(2.1)

r() •

ha

r(m) exist, and is finite.

Livingston and lain (1982) proved that yield curves •ust approach an
asymptotic limit in the case of par bonds; our assumption is needed to deal
with the more general case.

The second assumption requires that

the

forward rate approach this

asymptotic value quickly enough; precisely:

Implicit in this assumption is the mathematical consequence that the absolute

integral is also finite. The assumption (2.2) is not overly restrictive:

Under these assumptions (2.1 and 2.2) it follow, that the asymptotic

Consider the yield curve for U.S. Treasury bills on December 24, 1981,

shown in Figure 1. These data represent continuously compounded rates of
return based on the asked discount price from Federal teserve Bank of New

York quote sheets. Note that there is no clear indication of just how far
the yield curve might rise at a very large distance to the right. In
particular, has it leveled off already at around 13%, or is it continuing to
rise strongly beyond that?
Figure 2 shows the yield curve using the reciprocal maturity scale for

this same date set. Note th. clear tendency toward, a regular steady linear
increase for the longer ter, bills at th. right. For comparison, note that
the yield values are the same and are in the same order as in Figure 1. By
compressing the time scale at longer maturities, the reciprocal maturity plot
(Figure 2) expresses the expected decay towards an asymptotic yield as a

simple straight line. In particular, we gain the clear impression that
yields would actively continue their rise beyond 13%. Thi. fact ii difficult
to ascertain from the conventional yield curve (Figure 1).
