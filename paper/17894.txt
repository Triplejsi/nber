Central Banks and Gold Puzzles

NBER Working Paper No. 17894

ABSTRACT
We study the curious patterns of gold holding and trading by central banks during 1979-2010. With
the exception of several discrete step adjustments, central banks keep maintaining passive stocks of
gold, independently of the patterns of the real price of gold. We also observe the synchronization of
gold sales by central banks, as most reduced their positions in tandem, and their tendency to report
international reserves valuation excluding gold positions. Our analysis suggests that the intensity of
holding gold is correlated with ‘global power’ – by the history of being a past empire, or by the sheer
size of a country, especially by countries that are or were the suppliers of key currencies. These results
are consistent with the view that central bank’s gold position signals economic might, and that gold
retains the stature of a ‘safe haven’ asset at times of global turbulence. The under-reporting of gold
positions in the international reserve/GDP statistics is consistent with loss aversion, wishing to maintain
a sizeable gold position, while minimizing the criticism that may occur at a time when the price of
gold declines.

Introduction

The patterns of gold holding remain a debatable topic, especially at times when the
relative price of gold has appreciated while the global economy has experienced the
recessionary eﬀects of the global 2008-9 crisis. While most of the debate deals with the
private holding and trading of gold, we focus on the curious patterns of gold holding
and trading by central banks. Speciﬁcally, we study two puzzles: the passive holding
of sizable gold quantities by OECD central banks during most of the last ﬁfty years,
and the tendency to report international reserve valuations excluding gold positions.
While this omission is reasonable for central banks with negligible positions, it’s more
puzzling for OECD central banks that continue holding, mostly passively, large stocks
of gold. Figure 1 shows the remarkable persistence of gold positions (Billion ounces)
for most OECD countries during past years. With the exception of several discrete
step adjustments, central banks keep maintaining passive gold stocks, independently
of the market price of gold. Another puzzle is the synchronization of gold sales by
central banks, as most reduced their positions in tandem. As the central banks’
adjustment of gold positions may move markets, one may expect central banks to
stagger their stock adjustments, yet this has been the exception.
In an era when ‘plastic money’ and ‘electronic money’ gain importance in providing intermediation services, the case of holding, mostly passively, large piles of
precious commodity remains an enigma. By revealed preferences, central banks keep
viewing gold as a useful part of their portfolio. We compare the patterns of Non Gold
International Reserve/GDP and Gold/GDP ratios, applying a prevailing econometric speciﬁcation for explaining international reserves. Our analysis suggests that the

2

intensity of holding gold is correlated with ‘global power.’ While we focus on the
OECD countries, we include also the two emerging “super countries,” China and India, noting that their recent gold holdings increased in tandem with the sharp rise in
their economic power. These results are consistent with the view that a central bank’s
gold position signals economic might. This status is not a free lunch, as for most of
the sample the return on gold was lower than the return on US government bond.
Yet, at times of global turbulence, gold has retained the attractiveness of oﬀering a
potential hedge (Baur and McDermott (2010)).1
The tendency to under report gold positions in the conventional international reserve/GDP statistics remains a managerial issue that deserves explanation. A possible
take on it is that, as a rule, most central banks prefer portfolios oﬀering a stable valuation in terms of the chosen basket of global currencies. Central banks refrain from
holding stocks, thereby giving up possible gains from diversiﬁcation and a higher
expected yield (recall that during most of the past 50 years, stocks outperformed
bonds, a situation dubbed ‘the equity premium puzzle’). A possible explanation for
central banks portfolios is that being a public institution, diversiﬁcation into equities
is risky. Central bank managers face the downside risk of being blamed for large
declines in a central bank’s portfolio valuation at times of weakening equity markets,
while getting very limited gratitude at times of bullish equity markets. These reward
patterns encourage ‘loss-aversion’ on behalf of central bank managers, as sizable equity positions come with the risk of a manager’s job termination during bad times.2
1

Looking at the patterns during 1979 to 2009, they found that gold is both a hedge and a safe
haven for major European stock markets and the US but not for Australia, Canada, Japan and large
emerging markets such as the BRIC countries. Gold was a strong safe haven for most developed
markets during the peak of the recent ﬁnancial crisis.
2
See Aizenman and Marion (2003) for a further discussion on loss-aversion and central banks.

In these circumstances, the volatility of the price of gold possesses a challenge for international reserves managers. Not reporting the market value of gold as part of the
international reserve position may be a working solution for a central bank wishing to
maintain a sizeable gold position, while minimizing the criticism that may occur at
times when the price of gold declines. Similar incentives apply when the central bank
is concerned that capital gains associated with gold appreciation may be taxed by
the ﬁscal authority, whereas capital losses associated with Gold depreciation would
be viewed as reﬂecting portfolio mismanagement. In either case, the central bank is
exposed.

Empirical methodology

In this section, we set up the empirical framework to study the ﬁrst puzzle: the
passive holding of sizable gold quantities by OECD central banks during most of
the last ﬁfty years. In order to identify the determinants of gold holdings relative
to GDP and compare gold holdings with those of international reserve holdings, our
panel regression is based on the econometric speciﬁcation explaining international
reserve used by Cheung and Ito (2009):3
Central banks’ loss aversion may also explain why Sovereign Wealth Funds frequently are managed
outside of central banks.
3
See Appendix A for overview of the literature explaining International reserves patterns since
2000. Cheung and Ito (2009) investigate the determinants of international reserve holdings using the
cross-section regression framework with four control types: 1) macro variables; 2) ﬁnancial variables;
3) institutional variables; and, 4) dummy variables that control for individual economies’ characteristics. They ﬁnd that the demand for international reserves of developed economies is diﬀerent
from that of developing economies, and the set of (signiﬁcant) explanatory variables also changes
across diﬀerent sample periods. Furthermore, they show that a developed economy tends to hold a
lower level of international reserves than a developing economy, and there is only limited evidence
that East Asian economies including China and Japan are accumulating an excessive amount of

and TR. Financial variables include the ratio of M2 to GDP; the opportunity cost,
deﬁned as a diﬀerential between 3-month US Treasury bill yield and domestic lending
rate; the ratios of net equity, FDI and debt liabilities to GDP. The Dummy variable
is the ‘Empire dummy.’4

international reserves. Aizenman, Chinn and Ito (2011) deal with the role of international reserve
holdings in the trilemma policy choices.
4
When we run the same regressions with all ratio variables in log, many samples are lost due to
severe collinearities and zero values of some variables, such as net equity liabilities. Therefore, we
use the partial log linear regressions as the baseline speciﬁcation, similar to Cheung and Ito (2009).
5
Due to the data availabilities, we drop institutional variables used in Cheung and Ito (2009).
6
The ‘Empire dummy’ is based on economic and military strength during the past 300 years,
following Kennedy (1989). After France lost its power, the United Kingdom overwhelmed other
European nations, especially in terms of its economic power in the 18th century. The rising power
of Germany in 19th century and the emergence of the United States as a global superpower after
World War I and II added these two countries to the list. Finally, in Asia, Japan intended to become
an empire in the ﬁrst half of the 20th Century. We choose these 5 countries for the ‘Empire dummy’
list. Russia, classiﬁed as emerging country today, was the other pole of the bipolar world during the
Cold War. We review the gold holdings by Russia separately in the section dealing with emerging
super countries, focusing there on China, India and Russia.
7
The terminology of “Empire” may be controversial. However, our Empire dummy is a backward
looking indicator for ‘old empires,’ whereas some of the hoarding of China and India may reﬂect
signaling their greater global aspirations. For example, Japan intended to become an empire in the

Data

We refer to Cheung and Ito (2009) for variables used in the panel regressions. Our
sample covers 22 developed countries; Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherland, Portugal, Spain, Australia, Canada, Denmark,
Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and
United States. Our gold data is taken from the IFS, covering the gold positions of
central banks, corresponding to the focus of our paper. One should note, however,
that for some countries, part of the gold reserves are held by the treasury.8 For
these countries, our study provides only a partial analysis, understating Treasury’s
hoardings. The details on the data are in the Appendix B. While Cheung and Ito
(2009) use cross sectional variations alone, we focus on the panel data for developed
countries. The reasons are: 1) we want to use both time and cross sectional variations
in order to identify the history dependence of gold holdings; 2) gold holdings are likely
to matter mainly for developed countries; and 3) the degree of freedom in the cross
section data is too small for the developed country panel. For the baseline regression,
our sample is from 1979 to 2010. Due to the data availabilities, we drop from the

ﬁrst half of the 20th Century. Also, Japan was about to be an economic empire in the late 1980’s,
though the lost decade followed in the 1990’s. Therefore, looking backward, Japan can be treated
as an empire.
8
While in most countries gold and non-gold international reserves are managed by the central
banks, there are cases where some of these activities are delegated to the treasury or the ministry of
ﬁnance. For example, the Ministry of Finance in Japan manages its non-gold international and gold
reserves. Also, gold holdings by the Ministry of Finance alone are likely to be counted as oﬃcial
gold reserve, though the Bank of Japan also holds gold on its balance sheet. At the end of 2010, the
Ministry of Finance in Japan held 34.7 billion USD as gold, and the Bank of Japan held 5.42 billion
USD as gold. Since the data on gold holdings in IFS we use only reﬂect oﬃcial gold holdings, we
cannot take into account gold holdings by the Bank of Japan. Therefore, for some countries, we may
frame our analysis as focusing on the public sector management of gold and non-gold international
reserves.

Results of the baseline regression

Table 1 presents the results for the full sample (1979 to 2010) of 22 developed countries. Our preferred estimates apply the pooled OLS methodology.10

Table 2

to Table 4 show the results for the subsamples used in Cheung and Ito (2009); 1975
to 1981 for Table 2; 1983 to 1993 for Table 3; and 1999 to 2005 for Table 4. The
main ﬁnding is that in each subsample period, gold and non-gold international reserves have similar sets of determinants, yet these determinants are not stable over
time. During most of the sample periods, the signiﬁcant coeﬃcients on lagged ratio
of reserve holdings to GDP indicate strong history dependences of gold and non-gold
international reserve holdings. Moreover, volatility measures of gold and non-gold
international reserves have signiﬁcant coeﬃcients with positive signs – more volatile
reserve positions are associated with higher reserves held by central banks.

Chinn and Ito (2008).
We also include the Between Estimates (BE) in the Table 1.
11
To gain further insight, we run the same baseline panel regressions in order to see the diﬀerence
in determinants of reserve holdings between 1960 to 1969 (during the Bretton Woods era) and
1970 to 1979 (after the Bretton Woods). Data availability consideration induced us to drop 7
countries (Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Australia and NZ) and 4 covariates (op− cost,
equity− gdp, f di− gdp, and debt− gdp) from the sample. The results (available upon request) show
that there is no clear diﬀerence in determinants of gold and non-gold international reserve holdings
during and after the Bretton Woods era.
12
Because NZ and Norway have no gold holdings since 1993 and 2004 respectively, we take the
data for NZ and Norway since 1993 and 2004, respectively, from our sample. As a robustness check,
we eliminate NZ and Norway from the sample and re-estimate our baseline regressions under the
full sample (1979 to 2010). Comparing the results (not shown, provided as requested) with Table 1,
the qualitative results are similar. Therefore, taking NZ and Norway from our sample due to their
zero gold position was not crucial to our empirical analyses, though this treatment may cause the
self-selection bias.

Tests for the Regime Changes

As central banks adjustment of gold positions may move markets, one may expect
central banks to stagger their stock adjustments, yet this has been the exception.
Figure 2 shows changes of gold holdings (from the previous year in billion ounces)
for the US and the rest of 21 countries included in our sample. The ﬁgure indicates
that gold trading by central banks are synchronized during some speciﬁc periods of
time, while gold holdings are stable for the other periods; hence, there are likely regime
changes of gold holdings. To identify the timing of regime changes, from ‘constant gold
holdings regime’ to ‘variable gold holdings regime,’ we run the following regressions
for individual countries:

log(Goldi,t ) = a + b log(Goldi,t−1 ) + ²i,t

(4)

where Gold is measured in Billion Troy ounces. The regime with ‘constant gold
holdings’ is equivalent to the regime under the null hypothesis that

H0 : a = 0 and b = 1

(5)

We use the monthly data on gold holdings, from 1960 to 2010. For each country,
equation (4) is estimated annually, with 12 monthly observations, conducting the F
test of the null hypothesis (5). When this null hypothesis is rejected at the 5 percent
level, we identify the country as having an ‘active gold trading’ regime during that
year, and assign a value 1 to the “country’s regime” dummy. Otherwise, the country
is identiﬁed as having a ‘stable regime,’ and the “country’s regime” dummy is assigned

8

a zero value. Figure 3 shows the share of countries with the active trading regime;
equals the percentage of the countries which had active trading regime out of 22
1
sample countries ( 22

∑22
i=1

regimei,t ).13 The ﬁgure also reports the average volatility

of the log nominal exchange rates per the USD for the 21 sample currencies, excluding
the USD.
To track the global regime shifts, we identify the global regime as switching from
stable to active ‘gold trade regime’ when the share of countries in the ‘active regime’
moves above

1
3

1
(hence, 22

∑22
i=1

regimei,t ≥ 13 ). Figure 2 traces the ‘active global gold

trading’ by the shadowed areas, indicating that the global active regime periods also
correspond to the large changes in gold holdings.
Next, we verify whether the determinants of gold holdings diﬀer in the active
regime and stable regime. To answer this question, we include the regime dummy
variables for each country (called “regime,” which takes 1 if the country has an active
regime at the year) in the panel regressions of the equation (2). Speciﬁcally, we add
the regime dummies and interaction terms of the regime dummies with all covariates.
We also include volatility of the log nominal exchange rate. Table 5 reports the
results, where the coeﬃcient with

− act

stands for the diﬀerential eﬀect during the

active gold trading regimes. The ﬁrst column is for the full sample, the second to
fourth columns are for the subsamples used in Cheung and Ito (2009).14 As almost all
coeﬃcients of diﬀerential eﬀects are insigniﬁcant, we conclude that the determinants
of Gold/GDP are not statistically diﬀerent between the active and the stable regimes.
13

Data for Gold holdings by Australia from 1960 to 1965 are missing, thereby there are 21 countries
in the sample from 1960 to 1965. Moreover, NZ and Norway have stopped holding gold since 1993
and 2004, respectively. We treat NZ and Norway as having stable regimes since then.
14
From 1975 to 1981, op− cost is dropped due to many missing variables.

Probit for gold regime change

For robustness, we run a probit estimation to identify the determinants of “gold
trading regime.” The dependent variable is the regime dummy variable (regime) for
each country (obtained in the previous section),15 and the covariates are similar to
those in the baseline regression;16

where Xi,t is a vector of macro variables, Yi,t is a vector of ﬁnancial variables, Zi,t is a
vector of institutional variables and Di,t is a vector of dummy variables. c is a constant
and ²i,t is an error term. Recalling that Figure 3 suggests that high exchange rate
volatility may impact gold position, we added a control for exchange rate volatility.
We also control for the log of nominal exchange rates per the USD, since the fear of
USD depreciation may induce central banks to diversify its exposure by hold more
gold.17
The ﬁrst column of Table 6 shows the probit model results. As Johnston and
DiNardo (1997) suggest, for the sake of comparison we also run the same model
using the logit and OLS methodology, reported in the second and third columns,
respectively. Since the probit and logit models are non-linear, the coeﬃcients cannot

We also re-estimated the Probit model recognizing the possibility that European countries used
to peg their currencies to the Deutsche Mark. To verify, we included the following additional controls:
1) log of nominal exchange rate per the Deutsche Mark, 2) volatility of log exchange rate per the
Deutsche Mark, and 3) diﬀerence of log exchange rate volatility from the previous year (for the
USD and the Mark, respectively). The results (available upon request) indicate that our results are
robust to the inclusion of Deutsche Mark controls.

be compared directly. Yet, the sign patterns and statistical signiﬁcance are the same
across these three speciﬁcations. As a rough approximation, the following relation is
also known;
βlogit ≈1.6βprobit

(7)

where β is a coeﬃcient for logit and probit model, respectively. This relation roughly
holds in our estimates. Therefore, the inference below does not depend unduly on the
particular choices of model speciﬁcation. In Table 6, we show the results for 1) the
full sample from 1979 to 2010 in the ﬁrst to third columns; 2) the subsample from
1979 to 2006 (in the fourth column for probit) just before the current crisis; and 3) the
subsample from 2007 to 2010 (in the ﬁfth column for probit), which includes the 2008crisis period. Since the Probit is a non-linear estimation, the marginal eﬀects are not
unique and depend on where they are evaluated. To interpret the coeﬃcients, Table
7 converts the probit estimates into average marginal eﬀects, where marginal eﬀects
are evaluated at averages of the covariates. The ‘average marginal eﬀects’ mean that
if an average of the covariate increases by one unit, the probability of staying in the
active gold trading regime increases by the average marginal eﬀect in Table 7. The
results of the Probit indicate that the determinants of gold holdings regime are still
likely to change over time, and diﬀer from the period prior to the recent crisis to the
recent crisis period (though the sample sizes diﬀer).
In the Probit model, the ‘Empire dummy’ becomes signiﬁcant with a negative sign,
especially for the crisis period. Hence, countries classiﬁed as Empire are more likely
to be under the stable regime during the recent crisis. Our analysis suggests that the
intensity of holding gold may be correlated with ‘global power,’ by history of being a

11

past empire, or by the sheer size of a country, and especially by countries that are or
were the suppliers of key currency. Historically, holding large piles of gold indicated
global power, as Gold and silver were the foundations of the traditional monetary
system. The United Kingdom, the greatest economic power in Europe during 18th
and 19th centuries, accumulated a massive amount of gold. Under the gold standard,
London established its status as the global ﬁnancial market and acted as the lender
of the last resort for gold by the early 20th century.18 More recently, under the
Bretton Woods system after the Second World War, the USD, the only currency
pegged to gold, became the key currency for international goods and assets trading.
Even after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the United States remains the
dominant economic power and the largest gold holder [Table 8]. Consequently, large
gold positions of a central bank remain a signal of economic might, as may be the
case if gold provides ‘safe haven’ services at times of global turbulences.
Exchange rate volatility is statistically signiﬁcant with a negative sign before the
recent crisis. As the exchange rates per the USD become more volatile, central banks
are more likely to be under the stable regime. Intriguingly, the sign of log nominal
exchange rate changes before and during the recent crisis periods. Before the crisis,
as the exchange rate depreciates, central banks were, on average, in the ‘stable gold
trading regime.’ When the exchange rate depreciated during the crisis, central banks
were more likely to trade gold actively. Moreover, the coeﬃcient of equity also changes
the sign before versus during the crisis. Debt becomes signiﬁcant only during the
recent crisis period. In countries that incurred more equity liabilities before the crisis,
the central banks were more likely to be under the “stable regime.” In contrast, in
18

Kennedy (1989), p.245.

12

countries that incurred more equity and debt liabilities during the crisis, the central
banks were more likely to trade gold actively. The more FDI liabilities the countries
incurred before the recent crisis, the more likely the central banks were under the
‘stable gold trading regime.’ Finally, M2/GDP becomes signiﬁcant only during the
recent crisis. In countries with higher M2/GDP ratio, the central banks were more
likely to be in the ‘stable gold trading regime.’

Gold holdings and sovereign debt in Europe

Given the signiﬁcant current gold holdings by the Euro area countries, it’s of interest
to assess the gold positions of the Euro zone countries. Figure 4 reports the estimated
Gold/Sovereign debt ratios of the Euro countries, the top panel reports these ratios
since 1960, the bottom panel since 1990.19 In 2010, Germany had the largest ratio,
well over 10 percent, followed by Portugal (about 9 percent). The gold/Sovereign debt
ratios of the other Euro periphery countries were substantially lower: Italy (about
5 percent), Spain (about 2 present), Greece (about 1 percent), and Ireland (close to
zero). While several Euro zone countries keep holding signiﬁcant gold/sovereign debt
ratios, their holdings probably reﬂect historical factors, and do not adjust rapidly to
changing circumstances.20 Institutional features, such as the independence of central
banks and the Central Bank Gold Agreement,21 may prevent central governments
19

We use data on Gross Central government debt (total domestic plus external) as a percent of GDP (naming it Debt/GDP) from Reinhart and Rogoﬀ (2010) and estimate the ratio as
100 ∗ Gold (in U SD)
Debt/GDP ∗ N ominal GDP in U SD . Gold is from “International Financial Statistics” and GDP is
from “World Development Indicators.” For Italy and Netherland, general government debts are
used because of the data availabilities.

Gold holdings by emerging China, Russia and
India

Recognizing the growing global might of key emerging markets, we close the empirical
discussion by noting the recent sharp increase in the gold positions of the largest
emerging countries: China, India, and Russia [Figure 5]. Table 8 shows that as of
November 2011, China is the 6th largest gold holder in the world, Russia is the 8th,
and India is the 11th largest. Several recent articles indicate that these countries are
likely to continue building up their gold reserves.22 This trend is consistent with the
desire of ‘super emerging markets’ to signal their economic might, to diversify their
reserves, and to insure themselves during the global turbulence.

Robustness check

When the panel estimation has lagged dependent variable, OLS estimation is likely
to have estimation biases because of serial correlation. As a robustness check, we reestimate the model parameters by using the Arellano-Bond estimator23 to deal with
the serial correlation. The results in Table 9 (1979 to 2010 full sample; columns 2, 4, 6
using the Arellano-Bond estimator for non-gold international, gold, and total reserves,
respectively) indicate that the estimated signs on variables look similar to those in

Arellano and Bond (1991) or Arellano (2003).

14

our baseline pooled OLS regression (columns 1, 3, 5 for non-gold international, gold,
and total reserves, respectively), though the empire dummies are dropped in the
Arellano-Bond estimator because of the collinearity. Speciﬁcally, the coeﬃcients on
the lagged dependent variables become smaller in the Arellano-Bond estimator, but
are highly signiﬁcant. We can still ﬁnd strong history dependences of gold and nongold international reserve holdings. Also, volatility measures of non-gold international
reserves also have signiﬁcant coeﬃcients with positive signs.
Another concern relating to our empirical strategy is that the standard F-test in
equation (5) is no more valid when a variable has a unit root. To deal with this
issue, we conduct unit root tests instead of simple F tests for each country’s gold
holdings. The null hypothesis is a stable regime; equivalently, log of gold holdings
has a unit root without a drift during a year. If the null cannot be rejected, we can
say that gold holding in a country is within a stable regime. Otherwise, we identify
the country as having an ‘active gold trading’ regime during that year. Again, when
a country has an active regime, we assign a value 1 to the “country’s regime” dummy
and draw pictures similar to Figures 2 and 3. The sample for each test is still 12
monthly observations to detect a possible yearly regime switching, though the sample
size may be too small. Since we can only obtain critical values for a F-value-based
unit root test in case of 20 samples,24 we estimate the critical value for 12 samples
from 5 percent signiﬁcant levels for 20 and 30 samples. Figure 6 show that we can
identify regime changes quite similar to those in the standard F tests. Furthermore,
Figure 7 shows that even when we use unit root tests, we can still say that high
exchange rate volatility may impact gold position.

Finally, we run our panel regression again by including 1) Euro (called euro) and
2) EU non Euro country (called eu− no− euro) dummies. The results in Table 10
(1979 to 2010 full sample; all for pooled OLS) indicate that countries which introduced the Euro as their common currency tend to hold less non-gold international
reserves. This result is likely to reﬂect the fact that when the countries introduced
the Euro as their common currency the European-currency denominated international
reserves held before the introduction of the Euro were converted into the Euro denominated assets, which cannot be counted as international reserves. More interestingly,
the EU-member countries both with and without the Euro tend to hold more gold.
Nonetheless, other coeﬃcients of our interests have almost similar signs and magnitudes to those in the baseline regression (Table 1). Therefore, our results discussed so
far are robust, and our conclusions are still valid under the inﬂuences of the European
monetary union on non-gold international reserve and gold holdings.

Conclusion

Our study showed that Gold retains its unique status in central bank portfolios – sizable physical positions that are held mostly passively, reported at historical valuation.
A central bank’s gold position retains the stature of signaling economic might. The
intensity of holding gold is correlated with ‘global power’ – by a history of being a
past empire, or by the sheer size of a country, especially by countries that are or were
the suppliers of key currencies. The tendency to under report gold positions in the
conventional international reserve/GDP statistics is a working solution for the central
bank’s wish to maintain sizeable gold positions, while minimizing the criticism that
16

may occur at times when the price of gold declines.

Appendix - Papers on international reserves,
since 2000

A top cited paper on international reserves since 200025 is Rodrik (2006). He explains
the logic of the Guidotti-Greenspan rule,26 linking the desirable level of IR to the
short-term foreign borrowing and the costs of sudden stops. He pointed out that the
reason why developing countries have not tried harder to reduce short-term foreign
liabilities remains a puzzle.
Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber (2004) promote modern mercantilism,
dubbed, “Bretton Woods II,” as the explanation for large reserves accumulation in
East Asia. They view reserves accumulation as a by-product of promoting exports,
which is needed to create better jobs, thereby absorbing abundant labor in traditional
sectors.
Jeanne and Ranciere (2006) present a model of the optimal level of international
reserves for a small open economy that is vulnerable to sudden stops in capital ﬂows.
Reserves allow the country to smooth domestic absorption in response to sudden
stops, but yield a lower return than the interest rate on the country’s long-term
debt. They derive a tractable formula for the optimal level of reserves, and show that
plausible calibrations can explain reserves of the order of magnitude observed in many
emerging market countries. However, the recent buildup of reserves in Asia seems in
excess of what would be implied by an insurance motive against sudden stops.
Aizenman and Marion (2003) show that reserve holdings over 1980-1996 seem to
be the predictable outcome of a few key factors, such as the size of international transactions, their volatility, the exchange-rate arrangement, and political considerations.
However, after the 1997 ﬁnancial crisis, these factors signiﬁcantly underpredict the
reserve holdings of several key Far East countries. They show that sovereign risk and
costly tax collection to cover ﬁscal liabilities lead to a relatively large precautionary
demand for international reserves. On the other hand, countries with high discount

The Guidotti-Greenspan rule is that countries should hold liquid reserves equal to their foreign
liabilities coming due within a year.

rates, political instability or political corruption ﬁnd it optimal to hold smaller precautionary balances. They also show that models that incorporate loss aversion predict
a relatively large demand for international reserves. If a crisis increases the volatility
of shocks and/or loss aversion, it will greatly increase the demand for international
reserves.
Aizenman and Lee (2007) compare the importance of precautionary and mercantilist motives in the hoarding of international reserves by developing countries
during the 1980s and 1990s. Overall, their empirical results support precautionary
motives; in particular, a more liberal capital account regime increases international
reserves. Theoretically, large precautionary demand for international reserves arises
as a self-insurance to avoid costly liquidation of long-term projects when the economy is susceptible to sudden stops. The welfare gain from the optimal management
of international reserves is of a ﬁrst-order magnitude, reducing the welfare cost of
liquidity shocks from a ﬁrst-order to a second-order magnitude.
Flood and Marion (2003) provide a comprehensive analysis of the degree to which
the buﬀer stock model, used during the Bretton Woods system to account international reserves, applies in the Post Bretton Woods regime. The results are mixed:
the buﬀer stock model of international reserve holding works about as well in the era
of high capital mobility as it did when capital was less mobile. Its prediction that
increased volatility signiﬁcantly increases reserve holdings is very robust. While the
model works well statistically, it explains very little about countries’ reserve holdings.
Most of the “explanation” in their regressions is due to country speciﬁc ﬁxed eﬀects.
Eﬀective exchange-rate stability and a country’s ﬁnancial and real-side openness, together with volatility and opportunity-cost elements, can explain about 40 percent of
the variation in countries’ reserve holdings.
Aizenman and Marion (2004) view precautionary hoarding of international reserves needed to stabilize ﬁscal expenditure in developing countries. Speciﬁcally, a
country characterized by volatile output, inelastic demand for ﬁscal outlays, high tax
collection costs, and sovereign risk may want to accumulate both international reserve
and external debt, a combination that allows the country to smooth consumption
when output is volatile. Their framework also suggests that greater political instability would reduce reserve accumulation, a result that is supported by the data. By
implication, higher international reserves, other things being equal, may signal lower
susceptibility to crisis, thereby reducing sovereign spreads.
Garcia and Soto (2004) provide a useful framework quantifying the eﬀect of reserves on crisis probability and integrated it into a loss function analysis of the optimal
precautionary levels of reserves. They conclude that the stocks of reserves for most
countries in the early 2000s were consistent with an optimal self-insurance policy
18

under reasonable assumptions regarding the cost of a crisis.
Jeanne (2007) constructs a small open economy model with vulnerability to the
crisis and conducts a cost-beneﬁt analysis of reserve holdings and evaluates the degree to which the recent reserve holdings are consistent with the model prediction,
especially in Asia, since 2000. Holding reserves yields beneﬁts in terms of crisis prevention and crisis mitigation, while the cost is measured as the diﬀerence in returns
between the international reserves and more proﬁtable investment opportunities. He
shows that the reserve accumulation in Asian emerging market countries is diﬃcult
to justify in terms of self-insurance against capital ﬂow volatility and capital account
crisis, unless the output cost of the crisis is assumed to be unrealistically high. On
the other hand, his model works well for Latin American economies. The main reason
for a small marginal return of holding reserves in Asia is that their probabilities of
crisis are estimated to be small.
Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2010) link the reserve hoarding trend to three
key factors associated with the shifting positions in the Trilemma conﬁguration since
1990. The ﬁrst factor is the “fear of ﬂoating,” manifested in the desire to tightly
manage the exchange rate (or to keep ﬁxing it). The desire to stabilize the exchange
rate reﬂects a hybrid of factors - to boost trade, to mitigate destabilizing balance
sheet shocks in the presence of dollarized liabilities, and to provide a transparent
nominal anchor used to stabilize inﬂationary expectations [see Calvo and Reinhart
(2002)]. The second factor is the adoption of active policies to develop and increase
the depth of domestic ﬁnancial intermediation, through a larger domestic banking and
ﬁnancial system relative to GDP. The third factor is complementing the deepening of
domestic ﬁnancial intermediation with an increase in the ﬁnancial integration of the
developing country with international ﬁnancial markets. The combination of these
three elements increases the exposure of the economy to ﬁnancial storms, in the worst
case leading to ﬁnancial meltdowns, as was vividly illustrated by the Mexican 1994-5
crisis, the 1997-8 East Asian crisis, and the Argentinean 2001-2 ﬁnancial collapses.

3) For Australia in 2010 we use GDP per capita in 2010-USD from the FRED database to estimate 2000-USD data in 2010.
Specifically, we multiply 2000-USD data in 2009 from WDI by the growth rate of 2010-USD data in 2010 from the FRED.
4) For 2010, we use the FRED database for ``Import of goods and services'' of each country. Then, data are converted
into the USD values by using exchange rates at the end of year (December).

Notes

5) Since M2 for Euro Zone countries before the introduction of Euro are not available in WDI, we use IFS for their M2.
Specifically, Currency issued plus Demand Deposits plus Other Deposits (L34a.n+L34b.n+L35n) is equivalent to
Money plus quasi Money. For Austria, Belgium, France and Netherland, the data at the end of 1998 are unavailable.
Therefore, we use the nearest data point of their monthly M2 data series in 1998 for the end of 1998. Unfortunately,
the data for Netherland in 1998 are unavailable. Therefore, assuming that the growth rates of demand and other
deposits are the same as that of the currency issued only available in 1998, we interpolate the missing data. Finally,
the data for Australia in 2010 is estimated by the growth rate of M3 from the FRED database.
6) We interpolate data for Austria, Belgium, NZ and Switzerland by assuming that the growth rates of lending rates
are the same as those of other domestic short-term interest rates from IMF and OECD. Furthermore, since many data
for Euro Zone countries are missing after the introduction of Euro, we interpolate the missing data of Euro Zone
countries after 1999 by assuming that the growth rate of lending rate in each country is the same as that of
Euribor 3-month from OECD. The same methodology is applied to Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
7) FRED is the FRB of St. Louis, FRED database.
8) LM(2007) is from Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007).
9) ``Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey'' is used.
10) RR(2010) is from Reinhart-Rogoff (2010) and the data are available from Dr. Reinhart's website.

Box 1 - The case of Portugal

³

Historically, Portugal gold holdings have represented a large share of its international reserves, and very high Gold holdings to Sovereign debt ratio. Portugal
experienced huge increases in the gold-sovereign debt ratio in 1979 and 1980.
These hikes were mainly caused by rapid increases in gold price with gold holding
in quantity constant, and decreases in Portugal’s gross central government debt
as a percent of GDP. According to the Wall Street Journal article (“Portugal’s
Golden Dilemma,” May 17, 2011), Portugal was able to accumulate gold during
the World War II because of its neutrality. After the war, the Portuguese government preferred to save gold rather than invest it in Portugal’s economic development. Portugal couldn’t sell oﬀ its gold holdings in order to reduce Portugal’s
sovereign debt problems because selling its gold may revive the uncomfortable
debate about the past. The Bloomberg article (“Gold Makes Dead Portuguese
Dictator Top Investor Without Gains,” July 21, 2010) noted that the proceeds
from Portuguese gold sales still cannot be transferred to the state treasury.

Box 2 - Central Bank Gold Agreement

³

The recent oﬃcial gold holdings follow the agreement among the Euro zone countries, called the Central Bank Gold Agreement. According to the World Gold
Council,a in response to the concern that uncoordinated central bank gold sales
were destabilizing the market, driving the gold price sharply down, ﬁfteen European central banks announced the ﬁrst Central Bank Gold Agreement on September 26, 1999. The Central Bank Gold Agreement (also known as the Washington
Agreement on Gold) stated that gold would remain an important element of
global monetary reserves, and agreed to limit their collective sales to 2,000 tons
over the following ﬁve years, or around 400 tons a year. A number of other major
gold holders, such as the US, Japan, Australia, the IMF and the BIS, informally
associated themselves with the Agreement (or announced at other times that they
would not sell gold). The proportion of gold reserves covered by the Agreement
or similar announcements amounted to around 85 percent. The current agreement is the third one, invoking the same limits on gold sales as those in the ﬁrst
agreement. Notably, the actual sales have been signiﬁcantly under the ceiling set
by the agreement.

Box 3 - Increasing appetite to build up gold reserves by China, Russia and India ³

According to the Wall Street Journal (November 18, 2011),a while the central
banks had been net sellers of gold for about two decades before 2009, they became
net buyers in the second quarter of 2009. Several monetary authorities in emerging
countries, including China, Russia and India, have been building up their gold
reserves during the last 3 years.
• When the IMF decided to sell one eighth of its total gold holdings in September 2009, India became a counterparty of the gold sales, and purchased 200
tons from the IMF.b According to the FT.com (November 3, 2009),c India’s
ﬁnance minister said that the purchase “reﬂected the power of an economy
that laid claim to the ﬁfth largest foreign reserves in the world.”
• China, the country with the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world,
has increased its gold holdings in a quiet manner.d The recent rise of Chinese
gold holdings may reﬂect diversiﬁcation of its large exposure to the USD.e
• Russia has followed its long-term program of gold accumulation, and its
holdings have been gradually increasing.
a

The article is “Gold Lures Central Banks.”
According to the World Gold Council website, the central banks of Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh purchased 10 tons each, and Mauritius also bought 2 tons. The IMF began phased
on-market sales in February 2010 and has sold around 15-20 tons of gold per month since that
date.
