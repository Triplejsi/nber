The Effect of Federal Deductibility

on State and Local Taxes and Spending

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of federal
deductibility of state and
local taxes on the fiscal
behavior of state and local governments. The
primary finding is that deductibility
affects the way that state-local
governments finance their spending
as well as the overall level of
spending.
More specifically, in states where federal deductibility
implies a relatively
low cost of using deductible
personal taxes (including income, sales and
property taxes), there is greater reliance
business taxes and other revenue sources. on those taxes and less reliance on
The effect of deductibility
on the state-local financial mix implies that
deductibility has a much lower cost to
the federal government than has
previously been assumed. Indeed, if

of financing from business taxes to personal taxes, causes a large enough shift
deductibility may actually
raise federal tax receipts. The
analysis also implies that deductibility is
likely to be a more cost-effective
way than direct grants for raising the
general level of state-local
government spending.
The present study uses the
individual tax return data in the NBER TAXSIM
model to calculate federal tax
prices for itemizers and other taxpayers in
each state. The econometric
analysis recognizes that the federal tax price is
endogenous (because it reflects the
state-local spending decisions) and
therefore uses a consistent instrumental
variable procedure. This use of
instrumental variable estimation
exacerbates the difficulty of making precise
estimates from the data. The
relatively large standard errors indicate the
need for caution in interpreting
the point estimates.

THE EFFECT OF FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTIBILITY
ON STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND SPENDING
Martin Feldstein*
Gilbert Metcalf*

The deductibility of state and local tax payments in the

calculation of

federal personal income tax liabilities is one of the key features of the
fiscal relation between the federal government and the governments of states

and localities. For 1984, deductions for state and local personal taxes
directly reduced federal tax revenues by an estimated $30 billion, more than

30 percent of the federal grants to state and local governments.1 When the
Reagan administration proposed to eliminate state and local deductibility as
part of its November 1984 tax reform proposal, the state and local governments
objected that deductibility is needed to maintain public support for existing
spending levels of important state and local activities and that eliminating
deductibility would subject taxpayers to unfair double taxation. The Treasury
Department agreed that the current deductibility raises state and local
spending but argued that this is a tax—induced distortion in the allocation of

resources that should be eliminated. The Treasury also asserted that the
deductibility provision causes a large loss of federal revenue and is of
primary benefit to high income taxpayers.2
The sensitivity of state and local taxes and spending to deductibility is
therefore a crucial part of the arguments of both the advocates and the critics

of deductibility. Unfortunately, very little is known about the quantitative
effects of the current tax deductibility rule on the behavior of state and local

governments. The purpose of the present paper is to make a first contribution
toward remedying that deficiency.

The paper gives particular attention to the possibility that the
deductibility of personal tax payments affects the way that state and local
governments finance their spending as well as the amount of that spending.
Separate equations are estimated for (1) per capita state and local personal
income and sales taxes; (2) per capita state and local revenues that are not
deductible in the calculation of personal tax liabilities, including corporate
taxes, taxes on motor vehicle fuels, license and user fees, etc.; and (3) the
level of per capita state and local spending.

The econometric evidence indicates that deductibility has a powerful
effect on the extent to which states and localities use deductible personal

taxes. The effect of deductibility on the overall level of spending by states
and localities is smaller and more uncertain. Thus deductibility causes
states and localities to rely more heavily on the deductible personal taxes

than on other types of revenue. The estimates suggest that eliminating

of the President (1985). For useful summaries of the traditional arguments

personal tax deductibility would probably raise federal tax revenue by only a
t

small fraction of the amount predicted by the traditional "static1' revenue

estimates

and might actually reduce it.3

The paper begins by discussing the theory of the federal tax price of
state and local spending and the implications of itemizer-only

deductibility

for the sensitivity of taxes and spending to current tax rules. The analysis
shows that previous evidence on the price elasticity of demand for state and
local services is not relevant to evaluating the likely effects of changes in

deductibility. Section 2 then comments briefly on previous research and notes
the difficulty of using that research to estimate the likely effect of

eliminating or changing the current deductibility rule. The third section
discusses our method of using individual tax return data to obtain federal tax

prices for each state and presents estimates for 1980. Section 4 considers a
problem of statistical endogeneity that occurs if this federal tax price
measure is used in ordinary least squares regressions to estimate the response
of spending to the federal tax price and suggests a statistical procedure for
avoiding this problem.

The fifth section discusses the specification of the tax and spending
equations and presents the statistical estimates of the effects of the federal

tax price and other variables on state and local taxes and spending. These
parameter estimates are then used in section 6 to evaluate the effect of
eliminating deductibility on federal tax revenue and in section 1 to discuss the
relative efficiency of federal grants and tax deductibility as alternative ways of

going beyond the traditional static revenue estimation procedures and
incorporating realistic behavioral assumptions in tax policy analysis. For

increasing state and local spending. There is then a brief concluding section.

1.

The Theory of the Effect of Federal Tax Deductibility on State and Local
Taxation and Spending

Before considering the choice process of the state or local community, it
is useful to begin by examining how federal tax deductibility affects the
preferences of a single individual who itemizes his tax deductions in

calculating his federal tax liability. For such an individual, the
deductibility of state and local tax payments reduces the cost of an additional

dollar of state and local taxes. If individual i is an itemizer with marginal
tax rate

the deductibility of state and local taxes means that an

additional dollar of state or local tax payment reduces the individual's federal

tax liability by mi dollars. The net cost to the individual of paying one
dollar to the state or local government is thus 1 -

mi.4

We will call this the

federal tax price of state and local taxes for individual i. Since the average
marginal tax rate for itemizers is 27 percent, the average federal tax price
among itemizers is 0.73, a substantial reduction in the price of state and local

tax revenue.5 Of course, a non—itemizer's federal tax liability is unaffected
by his payments of state and local taxes; his federal tax price is therefore 1.
A lower federal tax price for state and local personal taxes increases the

individual's preferred level of state and local spending. It also causes the
individual to prefer to finance those services with greater reliance on

4This ignores the fact that local and federal taxes are deductible in
calculating taxable income under some state income tax rules.
5The 27 percent is a weighted average marginal tax rate, weighted by the
amount of state and local taxes deducted. Thus federal revenue is directly
reduced by 27 percent of total personal deductions of state and local taxes.

deductible personal taxes rather than personal user charges (which are not
deductible) or corporate taxes and fees (which could reduce wages or cause

corporations to leave the state or locality). To the extent that the net costs
to the individual of the different sources of state and local finance are
initially perceived to be approximately equal, a change in the federal tax
price for a state or locality could cause a substantial substitution of one
type of finance for another without any significant change in the perceived
cost of funds and therefore without any significant change in the desired

level of spending. This combination of a sensitive composition of finance and
an insensitive level of spending is characteristic of the evidence presented
below.

The measurement and interpretation of the federal tax price of personal tax
revenue becomes more complicated when we shift attention from the preferences of
a representative itemizer to the decision of the community as a whole. If a
proportion p of individuals itemize, the average federal tax price is
1 - p +

p(1-m)

= 1 - pm.

Since only about 30 percent of taxpayers itemize

their tax deductions, the average federal tax price is about 1 -

.3(0.27)

=

.92.

The average price reduction is clearly much smaller than the price reduction
for itemizers.

the average tax price or the tax price of

relevant for local government decisions? There is,

unfortunately, no agreement among specialists in state and local public finance
about the relation between local government fiscal decisions and the preferences
of the individual voters in the constituency.6

6For surveys of the empirical evidence on this issue, see Inman (1979) and
Rubinfeld (1986).

-6-

The simplest model of this relation is the median voter model, first
proposed by Hotelling (1929) and developed by Bowen (1943), according to which
voters are ordered by their desired level of spending and the preference of the
median voter is decisive. This model has very important implications in the

current context. As a general rule, subject to one exception discussed below,
the median voter model implies that federal tax deductibility affects local
government taxes and spending only if the median voter is an itemizer.
How likely is that?
Consider this question first in the context of choosing the level of

spending with the sources of finance fixed. Will the median voter in this
context be an itemizer? The position of itemizers in the spectrum of demands
depends on the nature of individual preferences and on the relation between
income and the individuals' price of local public services (i.e., the
individual's state—local tax cost, net of federal deductibility, per dollar of

spending). In the standard empirical median-voter model,7 individuals'
demands for local public services increase with income and decrease with
price, and the price is itself negatively related to income because federal
deductibility outweighs the limited progressivity of state-local tax systems.
In this situation, the individuals who itemize will generally have the highest
demand for local public services. Since only about 30 percent of all
taxpayers itemize, the itemizers' demands will all be greater than the demand

of the median voter in every state and in large local jurisdictions. If

analyses based on this type of specification.

—7--

eliminating deductibility would still leave the demands of the former
itemizers above that of the former non-itemizers,

a change in federal tax

deductibility would have no effect on state and local spending.
This very simplified median voter model is likely to underestimate the

influence of the taxpayers who itemize. One reason is that an itemizer may be
the median voter even if itemizers prefer higher spending than non-itemizers
and are only about one-third of all taxpayers.

This could happen simply

because high income individuals are more likely to vote than lower income

individuals. The number of voters per tax return is also likely to be greater
for itemizers than for non-itemizers.

Probably the best direct evidence on

this issue is reported by Ladd (1984) who notes that survey information for
Massachusetts indicates that more than half of those who actually vote in most
jurisdictions are itemizers. Among 56 cities and towns in the Massachusetts
analysis, itemizers were the majority of voters in all but 16.
But even if itemizers are a minority of voters, changes in the

assumptions about state-local tax progressivity or about individual
preferences could also make an itemizer the median voter. A more progressive
state-local tax system could make the price of local services increase with
income, causing high income itemizers to be in the middle of the demand

spectrum. Alternatively, if individual demand for local public services does
not increase monotonically with income, perhaps because high income
individuals are more likely to prefer private education or private recreation
facilities, the median demand for local spending might be that of a high

income itemizer. In either case, eliminating federal tax deductibility would
raise the tax price of the median voter and reduce his demand for local

-8-

spending.

These comments suggest three different cases in which community demand
for state-local services might adjust to the elimination of deductibility
within the framework of the median voter model.

First if the original median

voter is an itemizer and that individual remains the median voter, his

preferences are decisive. The elimination of deductibility would reduce the
level of state-local spending by an amount that reflects

the increase in his

federal tax price (from 1-rn to 1) and his personal price elasticity of demand

for state-local services. In the second case, the rise in the price might
cause the demand level of the original median voter and of other itemizers to
drop below the level of previous non-itemizers, causing a non—itemizer to
become the median voter. In that case, the decisive level of demand would also
decline but by less than the fall in demand of the original median voter.

And, third, if the demand of itemizers is initially above the median level,
eliminating deductibility could cause a previous itemizer to become the median
voter or could cause the demand of some or all itemizers to drop below the

median level. In this case also the aggregate level of demand would decline
but by proportionately less than the demand of the typical itemizer.8
It is interesting to examine the quantitative implications for the
responsiveness of government spending to the federal tax price in the first
case in which an itemizer is initially the median voter and remains the median

voter when deductibility is eliminated. We shall assume that all spending is
financed by personal taxes. Consider a state in which 40 percent of voters

8Note that in this case eliminating deductibility may decrease spending
even though the median voter is not an itemizer either initially or after the
change in deductibility.

—9-

itemize and in which the average marginal tax rate of itemizers is 30 percent.
The average tax price of itemizers is therefore 0.7.

Since the tax price is

1.0 for the 60 percent of individuals who do not itemize, the average tax
price in the state is 0.4(0.7) +

0.6(1.0)

=

0.88.

Eliminating tax deductibility

would raise the price for itemizers from 0.7 to 1.0, an increase of 43 percent.
If the individuals' demand elasticity for public spending is E, the elimination
of federal deductibility would reduce the demand for local public spending to

only (07)E times what it is with deductibility. For example, even with a
quite modest individual demand elasticity (E =

0.5),

the individual demand

falls to a fraction (°.ir5 = 0.64 of its current value.9 With a unit
elasticity of demand, eliminating deductibility would reduce the demand of
itemizers by 30 percent.

Of course, the median voter cannot be observed. If deductibility were
eliminated, we would see only that the mean value of the federal tax price
increased from 0.68 to 1.00, an increase of 14 percent. If an itemizer is and

remains the median voter with a demand elasticity of 0.5 and a tax price of

0.7, demand would fall by 1O0(1-.7) = 16 percent. The observation of a
16 percent fall in demand when the price increases by 14 percent implies an

aggregate price elasticity of approximately 1.4.10 Similarly, if the
individual price elasticity of the median voter is 1.0, the demand would fall
by 30 percent, implying an aggregate price elasticity of nearly 3.

9See, Inman (1979) and Rubinfeld (1986) for surveys of the estimated
price elasticities of demand for local public services. Inman (1979) reports
that most estimated demand elasticities for local government services are
between 0.1 and 0.1. The problems of interpreting these estimates are
discussed in Section 2.
10More generally if the if the proportion of itemizers is p and the median
voter is an itemizer with marginal tax rate t and demand elasticity E, the
implied elasticity of aggregate demand with respect to the average tax price
is E* = E ln (1—t)/ln (1 — p + p (1—tfl.

-10-

In short, if an itemizer is the median voter and remains the median
voter, a quite modest individual price elasticity would cause a relatively

large aggregate price elasticity. More generally, however, if eliminating
deductibility would change the identity of the median voter (i.e., the second
and third cases described above), the aggregate price elasticity might be

smaller or larger than the price elasticity of the typical individual. It is
clear from these comments that, even in the context of the median voter model
with all spending financed by deductible personal taxes, it is wrong to use the
previously estimated price elasticities of demand to evaluate the likely impact
of changing the federal tax deductibility of state and local taxes.11
It is important to emphasize that this analysis of the impact of
deductibility on spending has assumed that all state and local spending is

financed exclusively be personal tax payments. In fact, no state relies
exclusively on personal taxes to finance state and local spending. On average,
the personal income, sales and property taxes account for about two-thirds of
total state and local revenue exclusive of grants from the federal government.
The remainder includes corporate income taxes, user fees, license fees,
gift and estate taxes, selective excise taxes and other sources of revenue
that are not eligible for the personal income tax deduction.
The median voter model has important implications about the reliance on

personal taxes to finance state and local spending. Even if itemizers are a
minority of taxpayers, their higher propensity to vote may make them a
majority of voters. In addition, the structure of state and local taxes

11Several studies have done just that. These include Ladd (1984), Noto and
Zimmerman (1984) and the Congressinal Research Service study prepared for the
Senate Committee on Government Operations by Noto and Zimmerman (1983).

—11—

(e.g., the progressivity of the personal tax or the range of goods taxed by
the sales tax) will determine whether itemizers at different income levels
would prefer the state and local governments to substitute other types of
finance for personal taxes. In short, there is a wide range of situations in
which the decisive voter on the share of total revenue to be raised from
personal taxes will be an itemizer.
In general, deductibility will increase the extent to which state and
local governments choose to rely on personal taxes. More generally, a lower
federal tax price of such state—local personal taxes will increase their
relative importance in the financing of state and local outlays. The evidence
presented below indicates that the mix of personal and other taxes is quite
sensitive to the federal tax price of state-local personal taxes.
This effect of the federal tax price on the mix of state and local
financing is not only important in itself but also has implications for the
effect of deductibility on the level of state and local spending. As we
already noted above in discussing the financing preferences of an individual
itemizer, the ability to substitute alternative sources of state-local revenue
for the personal tax reduces the impact of deductibility on the net individual

cost of state-local spending. This implies that the effect on state-local
spending of changes in deductibility will be less than would be implied by the
corresponding change in the federal tax price of personal tax revenue.
But even within the median voter model, it is impossible to know from a
priori considerations alone how changes in deductibility that affect the
chosen mix of financing will alter the resulting level of state-local

spending. What matters in the median voter model is how the change in

—12-

financing affects the price perceived by the individual who is the median

voter with respect to the spending decision.12 It is even possible that
eliminating deductibility could reduce the cost of local government spending
for this median voter. For example, if the median voter is and remains a
nonitemizer and elimination of deductibility causes a shift from the personal
tax to the corporate tax, the cost of state-local spending for the median
voter might fall.

In this case, eliminating deductibility would actually cause

state—local government spending to increase.

We have focused on the implications of the median voter model because of
its analytic attractiveness and its place in the theory of local public

finance. But although the model is analytically attractive, it is clearly not
rich enough to deal with a variety of aspects of actual state and local

spending and tax issues. In general, the local government must make a variety
of interrelated but separate tax and spending decisions. An important feature
of such decision-making may be log—rolling, coalition formation and the
development of stable political parties in which different voter subgroups
support each others' preferred projects and compromise on a package of tax

sources. In addition, a number of studies have pointed to the bureaucracy and
to the politically elected officials as independent sources of influence on

budgetary choices. And, finally, the process of majority choice may induce
migration among jurisdictions that changes the composition of each area's

voting group and therefore the outcome of the voting process.13 The

12This analysis simplifies by separating the decisions on financing and
spending. If the two are taken together, it is even more difficult to know how
to identify the decisive voter and the conclusions are more ambiguous.
13For a discussion of these issues, see Inman (1979, 1986).

—13—

implications of the median voter model must therefore be regarded as only
suggestive of the potential effects of federal tax deductibility and of
variations in the tax price of state-local spending.

These brief comments have three clear implications. First, it is
important to recognize that deductibility is likely to affect the mix of
revenue sources for state and local governments as well as the level of

spending. Second, changes in the mix of revenue sources can greatly attenuate
(or even reverse) the effect of deductibility on the net cost to the local
taxpayer of providing state and local services and therefore on the demand for
state and local services. Third, the median voter model (and presumably other
formal models as well) implies that the aggregate elasticity of demand for
local services may be very different from the underlying individual demand

elasticities. In some cases, where the median voter is decisive and is not an
itemizer, the aggregate demand elasticity may be zero regardless of the demand

elasticities of the individual voters. But the analysis also shows that the
aggregate demand elasticity may be substantially larger than the demand
elasticity of the individual voter. From these three considerations, it is
clear that it is not possible on the basis of either theory or previous
research on state—local demand elasticities to evaluate the likely effects of
changes in deductibility on the mix of financing and the level of spending.
But before turning to our own research, we review briefly the previous
research on the demand elasticity of state and local government spending as
well as some more recent research on the effects of federal tax deductibility.

Previous Research on the Price Elasticity of Demand for
Public Services and on the Effects of Federal Tax Deductibility

Most previous research on the price elasticity of demand for state and
local public services has been based on interjurisdictional differences in the
costs of buying public services that arise because of intergovernmental
matching programs or interjurisdictional differences in the costs of producing

public services.14 It is important to emphasize that these sources of
differences in the costs of public services affect all taxpayers equally. As
a result, they provide little information about the likely impact of a change
in the federal tax price that would affect only those taxpayers who itemize in
calculating their federal income tax liability or that would alter the mix of
financing.

More specifically, the existing estimates of the price elasticities of
local government spending based on intergovernmental matching grants are, at
best, an approximation of the underlying price elasticities of demand of

individual voters. Even this interpretation is subject to several

difficulties. Many matching grants combine elements of block grant and pure
open-ended matching grant, making it difficult to separate income and price

effects. Moreover, most statistical studies of the effect of pure block
grants indicate a more powerful impact than would be implied by the

corresponding income effect; this is the so-called "flypaper effect"15 that

4Jnman (1986.) summarizes a large selection of research on this type of
analysis. Inman (1979) reports that most estimated demand elasticities are
between 0.1 and 0.7.
15The term comes from Gramlich and Galper (1973).

—15—

causes block grants to local governments or particular agencies to raise their
spending by much more than an equal increase in the income of the
jurisdiction's residents. Estimates of the impact of the price changes induced
by matching grants are therefore likely to be a combination of a true price
effect and a flypaper effect. Since the change in the federal tax price
affects the cost to individual taxpayers but not the revenue to the local
government, there would be no corresponding flypaper effect.
Price elasticities estimated on the basis of interjurisdictjon differences
in the costs of producing public services are subject to a quite different
bias that makes them unreliable as a basis for estimating the likely effect of

changes in deductibility. Differences in wages and salaries are the most
important reason for interjurisdiction differences in the cost of providing

services. If these wage differences were a truly exogenous measure of the
supply price of labor input of a fixed quality, they would provide a useful
basis for estimating the price sensitivity of local government spending to

changes in the cost of services to all voters. In practice, however, the
observed wage differences are likely to be endogenous and, in large part, to

reflect local choices of the quality of personnel. The result of this is to
bias the price elasticity toward zero or even to produce estimated price

elasticities that have the wrong sign. For example, a town that has a strong
preference for education (i.e, a positive stochastic disturbance in the
equation describing educational spending) is likely to choose not only a
larger quantity of teachers but also a higher level of teachers' salaries in

order to attract higher quality teachers. In this situation, if the level of
teachers' salaries is used as a price variable in a demand equation, the

—16—

estimated coefficient may well have the wrong sign.
Robert Inman (1985) has provided the only explicit econometric study of
the effect of the federal deductibility of local taxes. His study examined the

experience of 41 large cities during the years 1960 to 1980 and estimated the
price elasticities of local spending and tax revenue with respect to an

estimate of the local average federal tax price. The resulting parameter
estimates are puzzling, with signs on the key tax price variables that are the

opposite of what would be expected. For example, Inman finds that a higher
tax price for property taxes reduces the use of income and sales taxes and
that a higher tax price for income and sales taxes reduces the use of the

property tax. It seems likely that these surprising results reflect two
serious problems in Inman's procedure.

First, the basic data needed to estimate the federal tax prices (i.e.,
the actual federal marginal tax rates and itemizer status for individuals in

these cities) is not available. Inman's solution to this serious problem is
to combine the Census Bureau estimates of the income level at the 25th, 50th
and 75th percentile points of each city's income distribution with the tax
rate at that income level and the national proportion of itemizers to create
an estimated tax price. Although this method is probably the best that could
be done to estimate tax prices at the city level, the result is clearly a very

imperfect measure. There is no information on high income individuals who
make up the bulk of the itemizers and therefore no information on the average

tax rate of itemizers. Imputing a probability of itemization on the basis of
national totals ignores the likelihood that middle and upper—middle income
individuals are probably less likely to itemize if they are urban renters than

if they are homeowners and that home-ownership and other factors affecting
itemization may vary significantly among cities.

The second problem with Inman's procedure is that it focuses on city
budgets when the division of spending responsibilities and of tax bases between
city and state levels of government vary enormously among the 50 states. In
some states, the cities have a great deal of autonomy in setting taxes and are
responsible for spending on a wide range of programs. In other states, the
state government restricts the taxing authority of the cities, assumes
financial responsibility for most types of government services, and influences

local activity by regulations and matching grants. In Massachusetts, for
example, cities are precluded from using income or sales taxes and are subject
to a maximum rate on their local property tax; the state shares its tax
revenue with the cities through block grants and educational matching grants

and assumes full responsiDility for general welfare. Arrangements such as
these, which obviously influence taxes and spending at the city level, must be
taken into account in specifying the city tax and spending equations in order

to obtain unbiased estimates of the price elasticities of demand. Although
Inman has great expertise about these provisions and uses the available data
skillfully, the interstate differences in state—local institutional
arrangements are just too complex to be modelled adequately in Inman's

econometric equations. The inability to incorporate these institutional
arrangements into the estimating structure makes it very difficult to
interpret the estimated price elasticity of demand and the implied estimates
of the effect of eliminating federal tax deductibility.
A second recent study by fr4ettich and Winer (1984) attempts to assess how

—18—

federal deductibility and other variables affect the share of state taxes

derived from the personal income tax. Although the authors provide an
interesting analysis of local tax decisions as the outcome of choices by
public decision makers subject to political constraints, their empirical work

has three severe limitations. First, the role of deductibility is measured
very crudely by the percentage of taxpayers in the state with incomes greater

than $20,000. There is no information on itemization and no assessment of the
marginal tax rates. The estimated coefficient of this variable is
statistically insignificant and has the wrong sign. Second, the analysis
refers to the share of personal income taxes in the state's tax revenue
rather than to the share of income, property and sales taxes, all of which are

deductible. A larger number of high income individuals may encourage
concentration on the income tax rather than the property or sales tax but this
says nothing about the effect of deductibility on the use of the eligible set

of taxes. Third, the focus is on the state rather than the combined
state—local fiscal decision. Since states differ in the division of the tax
base between the state level and the localities, an analysis of the state's

relative use of one type of tax base may be misleading. Finally, the authors

include state expenditure per capita among the regressors. This is a
potential source of very substantial simultaneous equations bias affecting all

of the coefficients. More generally, it is not clear why the spending level

should be taken as logically prior to the composition of taxes. A better
specification with the cross-section sample would be simultaneous choice, with

neither taxes nor spending among the regressors. With all of these problems,
it is not surprising that the estimated effect of deductibility on the

—19—

composition of the tax revenue is estimated to be insignificant and of the
wrong sign.

The only other study that we know that deals empirically with the effect
of deductibility on the state—local tax structure is the work of Zimmerman

(1983). He elaborates a median voter model and then concludes, on the basis
of his statistical evidence, that federal deductibility has no statistically
significant effect on the ratio of the state—local taxes paid by the median
income family to the average over all families of the state—local taxes paid

in the state. There are a number of problems with the specification that make

it difficult to interpret this finding. Zimmerman includes the average public
sector wage and the level of state-local spending among the regressors

although both would probably be very endogenous. In addition1 the federal tax
price variable is calculated only for the median voter, who Zimmerman

arbitrarily assumes is the sane as the median income family. If the actual
decision process gives weight to others as well, the tax price of the median

voter may be too restrictive a specification. In particular, the empirical
analysis makes no allowance for the effect of differences in the relative
frequency of itemizers among states. The absence of this source of variation
in the average tax price nay explain why his federal deductibility variable

"apparently does not possess sufficient variation ..

to

make it a significant

determinant."

We have concluded that because of the shortcomings of previous estimates
of the price elasticity and because of the special problems of analyzing a
policy change that affects only itemizers, there are currently no useful

estimates upon which to base an analysis of the likely effects of changes in

-20-

the federal deductibility of state and local taxes.

Using Federal Tax Prices Based on Individual Tax Return Data
to Estimate Tax and Spending Behavior of State-Local Governments

in the present paper, we use observations for a cross—section of states
to estimate the effect of the federal tax price on the combined total of state
and local personal taxation in each state as well as on aggregate state and

local spending in the state. By combining state and local levels in this way,
we avoid the problem of institutional differences in the assignment of
spending and tax responsibilities. In effect, our specification treats the
assignment of such responsibilities as an endogenous behavior that is
influenced by such variables as the federal tax price and the distribution of
income. Our estimates are therefore in the nature of reduced form equations
relating spending and taxes within each state, (including both the state and
local levels of government within the state) to the price, Income, demographic
and environmental variables that characterize the state.
The statistical analysis presented below relates to three state—local
fiscal variables: (1) the combined state arid local revenue from personal
deductible taxes including income taxes, sales taxes and property taxes; (2)
all other state and local revenue, including corporate income taxes, severance
taxes1 license fees, special excise taxes that are not deductible on personal
tax returns, and gift and estate taxes; and (3) the spending financed from

state-local resources. The third variable is thus the sum of the first two.
Specifically excluded is all forms of federal aid.
The state and local revenue from personal taxes averaged $813 per capita

—21—

with a standard deviation of $198. This represented an average of 8.9 percent
of personal income with a standard deviation of 1.4 percent. The remaining
state and local revenue averaged $441 per capita with a standard deviation of

$488. This corresponds to an average of 4.6 percent of personal income with a

standard deviation of 3.8 percent. Finally, total spending financed by own
revenue is the sum of these two revenue sources, $1254 per capita or

13.4 percent of income. The standard deviation of total spending is $595 or
4.1 percent when calculated as a percent of income. The per capita levels and
income shares for the three fiscal variables are presented •in Tables A-4 and
A—S of the appendix.

The key federal tax price variable for each state is calculated using

individual federal income tax returns. More specifically1 the federal tax
price data are generated by the National Bureau of Economic Research TAXSIM

model with data for 1980. The TAXSIM model incorporates 21,787 individual tax
returns provided by the Internal Revenue Service and a computer program that
can calculate each taxpayers liability under existing and alternative tax

laws. The 21,784 tax returns are a one-in-eight random sample of the
stratified random sample of all returns for 1979 provided by the Internal

Revenue Service adjusted to 1980 income levels. Since sample weights and
state identifiers are provided, this sample can be used to estimate average

characteristics of the taxpayers of each state. This use of individual tax
returns is a unique advantage of the current data over previous studies that
had to use various measures of aggregated data or representative individuals
to estimate tax rates for each state (e.g., Inman (1985) and Phares (1980)).
For each individual, the federal tax price is defined as 1 if the

—22—

individual Is a non-itemizer and as one minus the decrease in federal tax
liability per dollar increase in itemized deductions for an individual who

itemizes. In general, the tax price for an itemizer is one minus the
individual's marginal tax rate but the calculation is more complex for
—

individuals

who are income averagers, subject to the alternative minimum tax,

or in other special situations. The TAXSIM program calculates the correct
federal tax price by increasing the individual's itemized deductions by $100,
recomputing the individual's tax liability, and dividing the difference in
tax liability by $100.

Table A—i of the appendix shows the federal tax price for each state, the
proportion of taxpayers who itemize and the federal tax price for those
itemizers. The average value of the federal tax price is 0.92, implying that
federal tax deductibility reduces the cost of state and local spending by an

average of 8 percent. The federal tax price ranges from a low of 0.87 in
Alaska to a high of .96 in South Dakota with a standard deviation of 0.02.
Much of the variation in the federal tax price reflects interstate differences

in the proportion of itemizers. Column 2 shows that this varies from a low of
14 percent in South Dakota to a high of 44 percent in Michigan with a standard

deviation of 6.6. The average federal tax price among itemizers varies from a
low of 0.65 in Alaska to a high of 0.78 in Montana with a standard deviation
of 0.02.

The econometric estimates relate each of the three fiscal measures to the
federal tax price, to per capita income and to several other economic and
demographic characteristics of the state. Two alternative specifications are

examined. In the income share equations, the dependent variable is the ratio

—23—

of each fiscal variable to

average personal income in the state and the

price variable is the average federal

tax price in the state. In the constant

price elasticity equations, the dependent variable is the logarithm of the
per
capita value of the fiscal variable (e.g.. the
logarithm of per capita
state-local personal taxes) and the price variable is the logarithm of the
federal tax price.

The income variable used in these analyses is the Census definition of
average per capita personal money income.
no problem of potential collinearity and

It is worth noting that there is

underidentifjcaj0 of the type that

arises when a marginal tax rate variable and an income variable for each
individual derived from tax return data are included in a microeconometric
demand equation because in the current specification the income variable is
a
broader measure of money income and,

more importantly, because the federal

tax price variable includes the marginal tax rate only for itemizers. The

correlation between the income variable and the federal tax variable is
only -0.53.

Most of the other variables Included in the

estimation equations are the

familiar explanatory variables of previous studies of state and local spending.
These include the number of pupils per capita, the road mileage per capita,

and the proportions of the population who are aged, in poverty, homeowners,

living in urban areas, married and nonwhite.16 In addition to these variables,
we have also used the NBER TAXSIM model to derive

several measures of the

distribution of income in each state: the variance and skewedness of the income

16Sources of these variables are listed in Appendix A—3

—24—

distribution; the average ratio of dividends to adjusted gross income; the
average ratio of capital gains to adjusted gross income; and the percentages
of taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes in the ranges $7500 to $15,000;
$15,000 to $25,000; $25,000 to $35,000; $35,000 to $50,000; and over $50,000.
In addition to the average federal tax price for the state, we have also
estimated equations with the tax price for itemizers, with the proportion of
taxpayers who itemize, and with various combinations of these variables. This
allows us to compare a pure median voter model (in which the median voter is
an average itemizer) with the more general specification in which the relative
number of itemizers is also important.

4.

A Problem of Statistical Endopeneity

There is however a serious problem in using any of these federal tax

price variables to estimate the effect of federal tax deductibility on the

level of state and local personal taxes. To understand the nature of this
problem, consider a simplified specification of the basic equation that we
is the per capita level of state and local personal

have estimated. If

taxes in state i, P. is the federal tax price in state i, and V1 is the level
of per capita income, a constant elasticity specification is given by:

(1)

in T = a0

+

a1

ln

+

a2

ln V1 +

where u1 is a stochastic disturbance that reflects tastes and other unobserved
factors influencing the level of state and local taxation in state i.

Ordinary least squares estimation gives unbiased parameter estimates only

—25—

if the stochastic disturbances are

statistically independent of the price and

income variables. Consider what happens if the individuals in state i have
a greater than normal preference for relying on personal taxes to finance
state and 'local services.

A higher level of state and local personal tax

revenue per capita raises the typical individual's potential itemized
deductions and makes it more likely that individuals in that state will find
it optimal to itemize their federal tax return. This has the effect of

lowering the federal tax price for that state. Thus, to the extent that a
positive taste for financing state and local services by personal taxes
reduces the federal tax price, it induces a negative correlation between the
price variable and the unobservable stochastic disturbance.

In short, the

price variable is endogenous and standard econometric theory tells us that the
estimated price elasticity (a1 in equation (1)) will be biased in a negative
direction; i.e., the negative price elasticity will be overstated in
magnitude.

The reason for this statistical bias is easy to see. Consider what would
be observed if state and local governments were notat all sensitive to the
federal tax prices of their residents when deciding how much to spend and how

to finance that spending. Since an above average taste for state and local
services financed by personal taxes would lead to increased itemization and
therefore a lower federal tax price, there would still be a negative

relationship between personal taxes and the federal tax price. The
statistical estimation procedure would interpret this negative relation
incorrectly as a measure of the sensitivity of state and local personal taxes
to the federal tax price even though, in this case, there is no behavioral

—26-

relation between the federal tax price and the level of state and local

personal taxes. More generally, when a lower federal tax price does increase
the chosen level of state and local personal taxation, the simultaneous effect
of state and local taxation on the federal tax price will lead to an
exaggerated estimate of the effect of the federal tax price on the tax and
spending decisions of state and local governments.
Even when we look only at itemizers, there is a relationship between the

unobservable disturbance and the federal tax price. A positive disturbance
raises per capita state and local personal taxes, thereby increasing the
itemized deduction of those who itemize and tending to move them into lower

federal marginal tax rate brackets. For an itemizer, a lower marginal tax
rate means a higher federal tax price. Thus, for itemizers, an above average
taste for state and local services raises the federal tax price and tends to
diminish the absolute magnitude of the estimated price elasticity.
Since the statistical bias that operates through the increased
probability of itemizing is in the opposite direction of the effect through
the marginal tax rate of itemizers, the sign of the bias cannot be determined

a priori. However, since the variability and importance of itemization is
substantially greater than the variability of the marginal tax rate of

itemizers, it seems likely that the itemization bias will dominate. The
evidence presented below Indicates that this is so, causing the estimated
coefficient to be biased toward a more negative (absolutely larger) value.

Although ordinary least squares estimation results in a statistically
biased estimate of the effect of the federal tax price variable, a consistent

and asymptotically unbiased estimate can be obtained by using an instrumental

-27-

variable procedure with an appropriate instrument for the federal tax price

variable. An appropriate instrumental variable is any variable that is
uncorrelated with the stochastic disturbance term (u.) but correlated with the
exogenous component of the federal tax price variable.
We have used the TAXSIM sample of individual tax returns to construct a
set of instrumental variables that are correlated with the exogenous component
of the federal tax price and, as far as possible, uncorrelated with the

unobserved stochastic "taste" disturbance term. To compute the first such
instrumental variable, we begin by excluding the deduction for state and local

taxes from all itemized tax returns. We then calculate the marginal tax rate
for each tax return, including both itemizers and non-itemizers.

Next we assign

to each tax return a probability of being an itemizer based only on the
adjusted gross income (AGI) class of the return and the national proportion of

taxpayers in that AGI class who itemize.17 An average marginal tax rate is
then calculated for each state with each tax return for that state

weighted

by that return's probability of itemizing as well as by a weight that
correctly adjusts for the stratified random sample. This itemization-weighted
marginal tax rate is subtracted from 1 to form a type of tax price variable.

For an individual who itemizes his deductions, this procedure corresponds to
calculating the tax price associated with the first dollar of state and local

tax deduction; we will therefore refer to this as a first dollar tax price

instrument. Note that this variable reflects the marginal tax rates of all
taxpayers and not just of those who itemize. Because the synthetic

17For this purpose, we use 8 AGI classes

-28—

probability of itemization is used, the variable is not sensitive to the

actual rate of itemization In the state.
it might of course be objected that there is still some possible
endogeneity in this instrumental variable, i.e., some correlation between the
instrument and the taste disturbance in the behavioral equation. The first
dollar marginal tax rate reflects the level and distribution of income and of
such demographic variables as the proportion of aged persons in the
population, the number of children ,

the

relative number of homeowners, etc.

Since these variables also potentially affect the demand for local services
and, arguably at least, the reliance on personal taxes, the instrumental

variable would be correlated with the disturbance in the equation. To reduce
or eliminate this problem, these variables are explicitly Included among the
regressors in the specification of the equation.

The second instrumental variable is similar to the first in all respects
except that, instead of replacing each itemizer's state and local tax
deduction with zero, we replace it with the national average state and local

deduction for individuals in that adjusted gross inôome class. We refer to
this as the average dollar tax—price instrumental variable.

Our third instrumental variable is the proportion of taxpayers in the
state who would be expected to itemize if each taxpayer's probability of
itemizing was equal to the national average for his adjusted gross income

class. This is clearly uncorrelated with the taste factors peculiar to each
state and depends only on a particular nonlinear configuration of the state's

distribution of adjusted gross income. Since several variables representing
the size distribution of money income are explicitly included among the

-29-

regressors in the equations presented in the next section, the disturbance term
can reasonably be presumed to be tree of the effects of income distribution

that are the basis of this instrumental variable. More generally, this
instrumental variable gets its identifying power from the difference between
AOl and money income and from the particular nonlinear relation between AGI

and itemization. Two further instrumental variables have been constructed.
The first of these is the average first-dollar tax-price

among itemizers only

and the second is the average—dollar tax-price among itemizers.
In summary, the instrumental variables, unlike the tax price variable
itself, do not directly reflect the proportion of individuals in each state
who itemize or the deductions for state and local taxes within that state.
They are correlated with the federal tax price variable for each state to the

extent that that variable reflects the distribution of taxable income and
other characteristics of the taxpayers in the population.
Columns I through 3 of Table A-2 show the three instrumental variables:
the average-dollar tax price, the synthetic proportion of itemizers, and the
average dollar tax price for itemizers.

5.

The Statistical Estimates

The estimated coefficients of the tax—price variable corresponding to
different dependent variables and different specifications are presented in

Table 1. The first three columns refer to the ratio specifications in which the
dependent variable is expressed as a fraction of personal income, e.g., personal

taxes per dollar of taxable income. The last two columns refer to the

-30-

logarithmic constant elasticity specification. The coefficients of the other
variables in each equations are presented in Appendix Table A—6 and A-?.
These estimates are based on data for the 48 contiguous states.
Consider first the coefficients of the tax price variable in the equation in
which the dependent variable is personal taxes per dollar of personal income.
When all of the potential explanatory variables described in section 3 are
included in the specification and the equation is estimated by ordinary least
squares, the estimated coefficient of the tax—price variable is —0.43 with a

standard error of 0.14. This is shown in the first column and first row of
table 1.

Before looking at any of the other estimated coefficients, it is
interesting to calculate the elasticity of personal taxes with respect to the

federal tax price that corresponds to this coefficient. Since the mean value of
the tax price variable for the 48 contiguous states is 0.92 and the mean
value of personal taxes per dollar of personal income is 0.081, the elasticity
at these mean values is —4.55; this figure is shown in square brackets beneath

the standard error of the coefficient. Although —4.55 seems like a very high
elasticity, it is important to stress that it is not an elasticity of demand
for state and local services but for tax—deductible personal taxes used to

finance state and local spending. It is also helpful to recall that in a
median voter model (with realistic values of the tax parameters) the aggregate
price elasticity is approximately three times the elasticity of the individual
median voter.18

—31—

When the same specification is estimated by an instrumental variable
procedure using the instrumental variables described in the previous section,
the coefficient increases from -0.43 to -0.33 with a standard error of 0.21.

This IV estimate is shown in the second column of Table 1. The rise in the
value of the coefficient reflects the OLS bias discussed in the previous

section. It implies that the positive correlation between a taste for personal
tax financed spending by state and local governments and the resulting higher
level of itemization outweighs the negative correlation between the taste for
personal tax financed spending by state and local governments and the resulting
lower level of the marginal tax rate of itemizers.
The implied size of the OLS bias, about one-third of tfle consistently

estimated coefficient, is large enough to warrant the use of the instrumental

variable estimates even though they produce large standard errors. Despite the
decrease in absolute value, the IV estimate of the coefficient of the
tax price variable implies that the elasticity of personal taxes with respect
to the tax price is a very substantial —3.49.
The specification in columns I and 2 includes all 19 variables described in

section 3, including 9 variables that describe the distribution and composition
of income. Since there are only 48 observations, the coefficients of most of

these 19 regressors are smaller than their standard errors. In general, the
variables for which the coefficient is at least 1.5 times its standard error
are the number of pupils per capita, the percentage of the population in the
state living in urban areas, the percentage of the population that are aged,

and the percentage of the population that own their own homes. Restricting
the regressors to these four variables in addition to per capita income and

—32—

the federal tax price, yields the tax price coefficients presented in
columns 3 and 5.

In the ratio specification, the tax price coefficient declines to -0.15
with a standard error of 0.13. The implied elasticity of —1.59 Is very similar
to the constant elasticity of -1.71 estimated with the logarithmic
specification and presented in column 5. Restriciting the number of regressors
generally has the advantage of reducing the standard errors of the remaining
coefficients, something which is particularly useful in the context of
instrumental variable estimation, but also adds to the risk that the

coefficient estimates are biased. Although we believe that the complete
specification is preferable, we present both types of estimates.19
Return now to column 2 and the instrumental variable estimates for the

specification with all variables included. To assess the importance of the
tax price coefficient, recall that the average value of the tax price variable
is 0.92 and that, on average, the ratio of personal taxes to personal income

is 0.087. The coefficient of the tax price variable in the equation for
personal taxes implies that increasing the federal tax price to 1.0
(i.e. eliminating deductibility) would reduce the ratio of personal taxes to
personal income by 0.08 x 0.33

0.026, or about 30 percent of the existing

state and local personal taxes.

The coefficient of the tax price variable in the equation for all other
state and local revenue (excluding grants from the federal government) is a

positive 0.18. This implies that eliminating deductibility would cause state

190n the question of whether or not to exclude variables in order to reduce
the mean square error of the coefficient of interest, see Madalla (1971,
Chapter 10) and Feldstein (1973).

—33—

and local governments to change other tax rules in a way that increased
revenue from these sources as a proportion of personal income by 0.16 x 0.08 =

0.014.

This is enough to offset sli9htly more than half of the revenue that

is foregone because of the induced changes in personal taxes implied by the
coefficient —0.33.

unfortunately, the large standard error makes it difficult to have
confidence in the precise estimate of this tax substitution. It is somewhat
reassuring therefore that the specification with the restricted set of
explanatory variables results in an estimated taxprice coefficient of 0.17
with a standard error of 0.15, a coefficient that is almost identical to the
0.18 obtained for the full set of regressors. Some support can be also taken
from the fact that the implied elasticity at the means (3.94) is very similar
in magnitude to the constant elasticity estimated in the logarithmic
specification (3.24), although the standard error of that estimate is also
very large.

Since the net public spending financed by state and local resources is
equal to the sum of personal taxes and of other state and local revenue, the
coefficients of the tax price variable in the ratio specification in columns 1
through 3 is the sum of the coefficients in the two tax equations. Thus, in
the specification with all variables included (column 2), the tax price

coefficient is —0.15. This implies that eliminating deductibility would
reduce state—local spending by 0.15 x 0.08 = 0.012 or slightly less than
one-tenth of the current share of income accounted for by state and local

governments. The implied price elasticity of aggregate state and local
spending with respect to the tax price variable Is —1.08.

—34—

Once again, however, the standard error is very large and one cannot
reject the hypothesis that variations in the federal tax price of state and
local taxes have no effect on the level of spending. The specification with
the restricted set of variables provides further evidence that the effect of

the tax price on spending is very small. In that specification, the estimated
coefficient is only 0.02 with a standard error of 0.18. The general
impression of a small impact of the federal tax price on state and local
spending is also supported by the evidence from the logarithmic
specification.

The relatively large standard errors of virtually all of the coefficients
in Table 1 imply that the estimated price elasticity parameters must be
interpreted with great caution. It is nevertheless useful to summarize the
general pattern of behavior that is implied by these estimated elasticities
of tax and spending behavior with respect to the federal tax price variable.

The key finding is that the effect of deductibility is substantially
greater on the amount of personal deductible taxes paid to state and local

governments than on the total amount of revenue collected by the state and

local governments. In those states where the tax situation of residents leads
to less reliance on deductible personal taxes, the state and local governments

substitute other revenue sources. The parameter estimates indicate that
between half and all of the reduction in personal tax revenues induced by
variations In the federal tax price are offset by increases in other sources
of state and local revenue.
These statistical conclusions are based on a model in which the effect of

deductibility is represented by the weighted average tax price of both

—35—

itemizers and nonitemizers. At the risk of trying to squeeze too much
information from the data, we have examined three alternative specifications
in which the state and local tax decisions depend in a less restricted way on
the proportion of itemizers in the state (p) and on the average tax price of
itemizers in the state (tpi). The results of these more general
-

specifications, presented in Table 2, support the basic conclusion that

federal

tax deductibility induces state and local governments to rely more

heavily on deductible personal taxes but has a much smaller influence on the
total amount of state and local revenue.

The coefficients in Table 2 are all estimated by an instrumental variable
procedure and are based on the ratio specification (tax dollars per dollar of

personal income). The previously reported estimates for the effect of the
federal tax price on personal taxes are shown in the first line. When all the
variables are included in the equation, the coefficient is -0.330 with a

standard error of 0.214 (shown in column 1). When the specification is
restriàted to the tax price and the four statistically significant economic
variables identified above, the coefficient is —0.147 with a standard error of
0.130 (shown in column 4).
Line 2 shows the effect of adding the proportion of taxpayers who

itemize their deductions as a separate explanatory variable. This variable
is completely insignificant. It is less than one—third of its standard error
in both specifications. Line 3 shows that the same is true when the tax
price of itemizers is included as a separate variable; the coefficient is

very small and less than one-third of its standard error. Finally, in line 4,
we exclude the tax price variable and include the proportion of itemizers and

—36-

the average tax price of itemizers as separate variables, It follows from the
definition of the tax price variable (tax price =
tax price =

I

1

-

p +

p(tpi)

or

+ p (tpi—1)) that if the restriction of line I is appropriate,

the coefficient of p in line 4 would be tpi —

1

times the coefficient of tax

price in line 1 and the coefficient of tpi in line 4 should be p times the

coefficient of tax price in line 1. Since the average value of tpi -1 is
-0.28 and the average value of p is 0.27, the corresponding estimated

coefficients are reasonably close to their predicted values.20 In short, all
three alternative specifications confirm that the weighted average tax price
variable used in Table I and repeated in line I of Table 2 is an appropriate
specification for the explanation of the personal tax raised by state and
local governments.

The effect of deductibility on other types of state and local tax revenue
is analyzed in the specifications of lines 5 through 8. Including a separate
term for the proportion of itemizers in the state (line 6) or the average tax
price of itemizers (line 7) indicates that the variations in the tax price of
itemizers has a more powerful effect than the proportion of itemizers in the
state on the amount of state and local revenue other than the deductible

personal tax revenue. This is confirmed by the specification (line 8) that
substitutes the two separate tax variables for the taxprice variable; only the

average tax price of itemizers is significant. These results are generally
confirmed when the set of explanatory variables is restricted (columns 5
through 8).

20Compare the estimated coefficient of 0.100 for p with the predicted value
at the mean of -0.26 x - 0.33 = 0.09. The estimated coefficient of -0.142 for
tpi compares with the predicted value at the mean of 0.27 x -0.33 = —0.09; at
the weighted average value of p of 0.50, the predicted coefficient is -0.17.

The results are quite similar for the effect of deductibility on the net

spending of state and local governments. The average tax price of itemizers
has a more powerful and statistically more significant effect than the
proportion of taxpayers who itemize.
The standard errors of the separate coefficients are however very large and
the point estimates of the coefficients imply implausible changes In "other

state-local revenue" and in net spending. When all of the variables are included
in the specification (columns 1 through 4), the unrestricted specifications
imply that eliminating deductibility would increase "other state—local revenue"

by enough to raise total net state-local spending substantially. The
specifications with the limited number of explanatory variables (columns 4
through 6) imply more modest and therefore more plausible effects of
deductibility on "other state—local revenue" and net state—local spending.
Although these specifications also Imply that a higher federal tax price for

state—local spending raises the net spending by state and local governments, the
coefficients are smaller than their standard errors.
In short, the decomposition of the federal tax price variable into its two
components (the proportion of itemizers and the average tax price for Itemizers)

does not alter the two key conclusions reached with the composite tax price
varIable: (1) deductibility substantially increases the use of deductible state
and local personal taxes but (2) the net effect on total net spending is offset
in whole or in part by the decreased use of other sources of state and local

revenue. Although the standard errors are in general too large to make any
confident statements about the relative importance of the number of itemizers
and the average tax price of itemizers, variations in the average tax price of

—38—

itemizers may be more important.

Effects of Deductibility on Federal Tax Revenue

The present analysis has important implications about the effect of
deductibility on federal tax revenue and therefore about the efficiency of

deductibility as a way of increasing state—local spending. This section
discusses the effect of deductibility on federal revenue and section 7

considers the efficiency of deductibility as a means of increasing state-local
spending.

As we noted above, the Treasury has recently proposed eliminating the

deductibility of state and local personal taxes. The Treasury predicts that
this change in tax rules would raise amounts that increase from $33 billion in

fiscal year 1987 to $40 billion by fiscal year 1990. As such, the elimination
of deductibility is the largest single source of increased revenue in the

Administration's plan. Indeed, by 1990 it accounts for more than 85 percent
of all of the additional revenue raised from individuals by broadening the tax
base. Stated differently, it finances 55 percent of the personal rate
reductions, with most of the remainder financed by the increased taxes on
corporations.

The research presented here implies that eliminating deductibility may
not produce anything like the amount of additional revenue that the Treasury

predicts and may actually cause a fall in total tax revenue. The reason is
that eliminating deductibility is likely to cause state and local governments
to switch some of their revenue from individuals —— where each dollar of state

-39-

and local tax payment has a relatively small impact on federal tax receipts
to corporations where those same state and local tax payments have a much

larger impact on federal tax revenue. If eliminating deductibility causes a
large enough shift from personal taxes to taxes and fees paid by business, the
Treasury could actually lose revenue by eliminating deductibility.
Consider more specifically the situation in 1984 and the implications of

the estimates presented in section 5. The Treasury estimates that the
deduction of state and local personal taxes (including income, sales and
property taxes) reduced federal revenue by $29.9 billion in fiscal year 1984
and $32.4 billion in fiscal year 1985; we will take the revenue loss for

calendar year 1984 to be $30.5 billion. If deductibility had been eliminated
for 1984 and if state and local governments did not alter their business taxes
or fees, federal revenue would have increased by $30.5 billion.
In contrast, the estimates presented in Table I imply that eliminating
deductibility would increase the "other state-local revenue" as a proportion
of personal income by 0.18 times the resulting change in the federal tax price
of currently deductible personal taxes. The average federal tax price in the
1980 sample used to estimate those behavioral equations was 0.92; eliminating
deductibility would raise the federal tax price by 0.08 and would therefore
increase "other state—local revenue" by 1.44 percent of personal income.
Since personal income in 1984 was $3,012 billion, this represents a $43
billion increase in "other state-local revenue". Note that since the decrease
In personal taxes implied by the estimated coefficient of —0.33 is equivalent
to $80 billion in 1984, the increase in "other state—local revenue" would

—40—

offset 54 percent of the personal tax revenue lost by state and local
governments.

Before considering the implications of this increase in "other state-local
revenue't for federal revenue, it is worth considering an alternative estimate

of the effect on "other state-local revenue" of eliminating deductibility. In
1984, state and local governments collected $282 billion in the form of income

taxes, sales taxes and property taxes. Since approximately 50 percent of the
$98 billion of property taxes included in this total were paid by businesses,21

the potentially deductible personal taxes totalled $233 billion. A comparison
of the $30.5 billion of revenue loss in 1984 with the $233 billion of state—
local personal taxes implies a federal tax price of 0.81; with this value, the
parameter estimate of Table 1 implies that eliminating deductibility would
increase "other state-local revenue" by 2.34 percent of personal income.22
This 2.34 percent of personal income implies that "other state and local
revenue" would have increased by $70 billion.
The impact on federal tax receipts of the increase in "other state-local

revenue" depends on the nature of the increase. If these additional revenues
are paid by businesses in the form of higher taxes or increased fees, the

21The 1982 Census of Governments (1982) reports that single family homes
represent 52 percent of taxable property values. Unfortunately, these data
refer to assessed values rather than market values or actual tax revenues.
22The difference between the 0.92 average federal tax price in the
cross—state data and the 0.81 federal tax price implied by the 1984 experience
reflects two effects. First, the federal tax price of 0.92 is based on an
unweighted average of the marginal tax rates of itemizers and of the
probability of itemizing while the actual revenue loss reflects the positive
correlation of individual state and local tax liabilities with itemization and
marginal tax rates. Second, the 0.87 value reflects the fact that businesses
pay about 50 percent of property taxes.

-41-

federal government would lose approximately 46 percent of the rise in "other
state-local revenue" through lower corporate tax receipts or between $20

billion md $32 billion of reduced corporate tax receipts. In addition, the
reduction in net corporate income would mean reduced dividends and other
personal capital income and therefore a further reduction in personal tax

payments to the federal government. The combination of the decreased
corporate and personal federal taxes that results from the induced increase in
other state-local revenue would thus offset between 65 percent and more than
100 percent of the direct increase in federal revenue that results from
eliminating the personal deduction.
In practice, the offset to the direct increase in federal revenue might
be smaller than this because at least some of the increased "other state-local
revenue" would be in the form of greater charges to households for services

provided by state and local governments. The analysis is also complicated by
the fact that the businesses might in part respond to increased state-local
taxes and fees by reducing real wages. To that extent, the relevant tax rate
is not the corporate 46 percent rate but the personal rate on wage and salary
income.

There is, however, an important reason why the calculations presented above
may understate the adverse effect on federal revenue of a shift in the

composition of state and local revenue. The parameter estimates from
section 5 used to derive the shift in the composition of state-local
revenue are based on interstate differences in the federal tax price at a
point in time. A change in federal tax deductibility that affects all states

equally is more likely to induce an increase in taxes on business than the

-42-

same size difference in tax rates between two states. If one state raises its
tax on business because it has a higher federal tax price for personal
state-local taxes than the neighboring states, it is likely to drive some
business away, thereby reducing its tax base and decreasing the demand for

local labor. But if all states are faced with an increased federal tax price
for personal state—local taxes because of a change in deductibility, they can
all simultaneously raise their taxes on business without concern about driving
business away.

All of these considerations make it impossible to provide a precise
estimate of the likely effect on federal revenue of eliminating deductibility.

But they do make it clear that an induced shift in the composition of state—
local taxation in response to the elimination of deductibility could reduce
substantially, and might even more than fully eliminate, the prospective
increase in federal personal income tax revenue. As a minimum, the analysis in
this paper shows that it would be unwise for the federal government to assume
that eliminating the deductibility of state-local taxes would increase federal
tax receipts.

7.

The Cost—Effectiveness of Grants and Tax Deductibility

The low (or possibly negative) cost to the federal government of the
deductibility of state and local taxes implies that deductibility may be a
very cost—effective way for the federal government to stimulate additional

spending by state and local governments. This conclusion runs counter to the
conventional assertion that deductibility is a high cost way of stimulating

—43—

state—local spending.23 This section compares the cost—effectiveness of
deductibility and federal grants in raising state-local spending.
The basic coefficient estimates of section 5 (for the full specification
in ratio form estimated by an instrumental variable procedure) imply that
deductibility increases the ratio of state and local spending to personal
income by —0.15(—0.08) =

0.012, on the assumption that the relevant federal

tax price is 0.92.24 What is the cost to the federal government of achieving
this increase and how does it compare to the cost of other policies that may
achieve an equal increase in state and local spending?
The same data imply that the ratio of personal deductible taxes to

personal income is 0.087. Since the effective tax rate (reflecting the extent
of itemization and the marginal tax rate of itemizers) at which this is
deducted is 0.08, the resulting federal revenue loss is 0.70 percent of

personal income. Against this must be offset the extra revenue that the
federal government collects from businesses because deductibility induces
state and local governments to tax businesses more lightly and from individual
shareholders and creditors because of the increased net-of-tax income of

businesses. The relevant parameter estimate implies that deductibility
reduces "other state-local revenue" as a fraction of personal income by
0.18(0.08) =

0.0144.

If a fraction b of this reduction in "other state—local

23See the Congressional Research Service study for the Senate Committee on
Government Operations by Noto and Zimmerman (1984) for a recent example of
this conventional conclusion.
24Parallel calculations based on the federal tax price of 0.87 are
presented in footnote 21.

—44—

revenu&' would otherwise have been paid by business and deducted against a
federal tax rate of 0.46 percent, deductibility increases federal revenue from

businesses as a fraction of personalincome by O.46(O.0144)b = 0.0066 b.
The net cost of deductibility to the federal government, expressed as a
fraction of personal income, is therefore 0.0070 — 0.0066 b.25 If all of the
"other state-local revenue" is raised by taxes on business (b =

1),

deductibility has essentially zero cost to the federal government; this is the
result noted in the previous section. But even if only half of the !Iother
state-local revenue" is raised from businesses, the net cost of deductibility

is 0.37 percent of personal income or $11.1 billion at 1984 levels. Since
deductibility raises spending by 1.2 percent of personal income, the
cost-effectiveness of deductibility can be expressed as 1.2/0.37 = 3.24
dollars26 of increased state and local spending per dollar of net federal cost.27

25This ignores the additional personal taxes collected because of higher
dividends and interest income. Omitting this relatively small effect tends to
overstate the cost of deductibility.
26Taking the increased federal tax revenue on dividends and interest would
raise the cost-effectiveness of deductibility.
27With a federal tax price of 0.87, reflecting the weighted average
effective marginal tax rate for state and local tax deductions, the preceding
calculations imply that deductibility increases the ratio of state and local
spending to personal income by 0.15(0.13) = 0.020. With an effective marginal
tax rate of 0.13, deductiblity causes a direct loss in federal revenue as a
fraction of personal income equal to 0.0113. Business taxes rise as a
fraction of personal income by 0.18(0.13)b = 0.0234 b and federal corporate tax
receipts therefore fall by 0.46(0.0234 b) = 0.0107 b. The net effect of
deductibility is therefore to reduce federal tax receipts as a fraction of
personal income by 0.0113 - 0.0107 b.
If all of the other revenue is paid by
business, deductiblity has essentially no cost to the federal government. Even
when b = 0.5, the cost—effectiveness of deductibility is 0.020/0.006 = 3.33
dollars of increased state-local spending per dollar of federal net cost.

—45—

What is the net cost to the federal government of increasing state—local

spending by block grants to state and local governments? Several studies have
shown that federal block grants to state and local governments increase
spending by less than a dollar but more than the amount that would be expected

by a pure income effect.28 If the increased state—local spending per dollar of
federal block grant is s, the state—local governments reduce their tax

receipts by 1—s per dollar of federal block grant. If a fraction p of this
reduction is in personal taxes that would be deducted at effective marginal
tax rate iii

and, of the remainder, the fraction paid by business is b, a dollar

of federal block grant raises the federal government's tax revenue by
(I—s)(pm +

(1—p)(.46b)).

The increase in state-local spending per dollar of

cost to the federal government is thus s/fl - (1—s)(pm +

(l—p)(.46 bfl. For

example, using the average observed values of p = 0.65 and m = 0.08 and
assuming s = 0.3 and b =

0.3 implies that this cost—effectiveness ratio is

only 0.32 dollars of increased state and local spending per dollar of net

federal cost. Even if each dollar of federal block grant raised state and
local spending by a full dollar, the cost-effectiveness ratio would only rise
to one dollar of increased local spending per dollar of federal cost.

Federal grants/cande more cost-effective than tax deductibility only if
the federal grants are matching grants that increase state-local spending by

substantially more than one dollar for every dollar of federal grant. For
example, if each dollar of federal matching grant raised state local spending
by two dollars, the cost ratio becomes 1.82 dollars of increased state-local

28See Inman (1979) and Rubinfeld (1986) for summaries of these studies.

-46-

spending per net dollar of federal cost. But even with this very powerful
matching effect, the federal matching grant is far more costly than
deductibility per dollar of increased state and local spending.

These calculations imply that substituting direct block grants or
matching grants for deductibility would be very likely to increase the cost
to the federal government of achieving the current level of state-local

spending. It is likely that federal grants to state and local governments can
be rationalized only as a way to increase spending beyond the level that is

achieved by deductibility or to alter the distribution of spending among states
and program areas, or to redistribute income geographically.

B.

Conclusion

This paper has examined the effect of the federal deductibility of state

and local taxes on the fiscal behavior of state and local governments. The
primary finding is that deductibility affects the way that state—local
governments finance their spending as well as the overall level of spending.

More specifically, in states where federal deductibility implies a relatively
low cost of using deductible personal taxes (including income, sales and

property taxes), there is greater reliance on those taxes and less reliance on
business taxes and other revenue sources.

The effect of deductibility on the state—local financial mix implies that
deductibility has a much lower cost to the federal government than has

previously been assumed. Indeed, if deductibility causes a large enough shift
of financing from business taxes to personal taxes, deductibility may actually

-47-

raise federal tax receipts. The analysis also implies that deductibility is
likely to be a more cost-effective way than direct grants for raising the
general level of state-local government spending.

The present study uses the individual tax return data in the NBER TAXSIM
model to calculate federal tax prices for itemizers and other taxpayers in each

state. The econometric analysis recognizes that the federal tax price is
endogenous (because it reflects the state-local spending decisions) and

therefore uses a consistent instrumental variable procedure. This use of
instrumental variable estimation exacerbates the difficulty of making precise
estimates from the data. The relatively large standard errors indicate the
need for caution in interpreting the point estimates.
There are several directions in which the current work could usefully be

pursued. Combining cross-sections for two or more years could improve the
precision of the parameter estimates. A more disaggregated analysis of the
responsiveness of different types of revenue sources would make it possible to
calculate the federal cost of deductibility more accurately. This could
usefully be paralleled by a disaggregated analysis of spending.
But as of now, the analysis and data suggest that it would be wrong to
assume that eliminating federal deductibility would substantially increase
federal revenue or that substituting block grants for deductibility would
permit the current level of state-local spending to be maintained at lower
cost to the federal government.
