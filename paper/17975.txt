A Theory of Firm Characteristics and Stock Returns: The Role of Investment-Specific Shocks

April 2012
JEL No. E22,E32,G12
ABSTRACT
We provide a theoretical model linking firm characteristics and expected returns. The key ingredient
of our model is technological shocks embodied in new capital (IST shocks), which affect the profitability
of new investments. Firms' exposure to IST shocks is endogenously determined by the fraction of
firm value due to growth opportunities. In our structural model, several firm characteristics - Tobin's
Q, past investment, earnings-price ratios, market betas, and idiosyncratic volatility of stock returns
– help predict the share of growth opportunities in the firm's market value, and are therefore correlated
with the firm's exposure to IST shocks and risk premia. Our calibrated model replicates: i) the predictability
of returns by firm characteristics; ii) the comovement of stock returns on firms with similar characteristics;
iii) the failure of the CAPM to price portfolio returns of firms sorted on characteristics; iv) the time-series
predictability of market portfolio returns by aggregate investment and valuation ratios; and v) a downward
sloping term structure of risk premia for dividend strips. Our model delivers testable predictions about
the behavior of firm-level real variables – investment and output growth – that are supported by the
data.

Introduction

Recent empirical research identifies a number of firm characteristics that forecast stock
returns. There is also strong evidence of comovement in stock returns of firms with similar
characteristics. Returns on portfolios formed by sorting firms on such characteristics exhibit a
strong low-dimensional factor structure, with the common factors accounting for a significant
share of their time-series variation. Furthermore, cross-sectional differences in portfolio
exposures to the common factors typically account for a substantial fraction of the crosssectional differences in their average returns.1 A common interpretation of such patterns is
that the relevant firm characteristics are correlated with the firms’ exposures to common
systematic risk factors. Despite the pervasiveness of such results in the empirical literature
and their importance for understanding the risk-return tradeoff in the cross-section of stock
returns, the economic origins of thus constructed empirical return factors are often poorly
understood. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for the success of empirical
multi-factor models.2
We focus on five firm characteristics that have received considerable attention in the
literature. Prior studies have documented that firms with lower Tobin’s Q (or equity bookto-market ratios), lower investment rates (IK), higher earnings-to-price (EP), lower market
beta (BMKT) and lower idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) earn abnormally high risk-adjusted
returns relative to the standard CAPM model. First, we show that these patterns are closely
related. Specifically, the five sets of portfolios formed on these characteristics largely share a

the extreme portfolios, RN
t − R1t , a standard empirical approximation for the common return factor, tend to
capture a substantial share of the time-series variation in realized portfolio returns. Furthermore, differences
in exposures of the characteristic-sorted portfolios to such factors typically account for a significant fraction
of the differences in their average returns.
2

The ICAPM (Merton, 1973) or APT (Ross, 1976) are typically cited as theoretical motivations behind
empirical multifactor models. However, a complete explanation of the empirical return patterns should
address: a) why these returns factors are priced, and b) why firm characteristics are correlated with return
exposures to these risk factors.

common factor structure. After removing their exposure to the market portfolio, not only do
high-IK firms comove with other high-IK firms, but they also comove with firms that have
high Q, low-EP, high IVOL, and high BMKT. The first principal component extracted from
the pooled cross-section of portfolio returns – after removing the market component from
each portfolio return – largely captures average return differences among portfolios sorted
on each of the characteristics.3 These results suggest that the firm characteristics above are
correlated with firms’ exposures to the same common risk factor, which generates a significant
share of variation in realized portfolio returns and captures cross-sectional differences in their
risk premia.
We connect this common return factor to investment-specific technology (IST) shocks
using a structural model, based on Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011). Our model features two
aggregate sources for risk, disembodied technology shocks and technological improvements
that are embodied in new capital goods (investment-specific shocks). Firms are endowed
with a stochastic sequence of investment opportunities, which they implement by purchasing
and installing new capital. In our model, a positive IST shock – a reduction in the relative
price of capital goods – benefits firms with more growth opportunities relative to firms with
limited opportunities to invest. Hence, differences in the ratio of growth opportunities to
firm value PVGO/V lead to return comovement, and if IST shocks are priced by the market,
to differences in average stock returns.
We formally illustrate the endogenous connection between the above firm characteristics,
their growth opportunities, and their risk exposure to IST shocks.4 To do so, we extend the
3

This result is not driven by the same stocks being ranked similarly using each of the above characteristics
– correlations among portfolio assignments using various characteristics are low.

Prior research already alludes to such connections. Firms with more growth opportunities are likely to
invest more. Furthermore, such firms are likely to have higher valuation ratios (Tobin’s Q, price-earnings
ratios) since their market value reflects the NPV of future investment projects. In addition, by the logic of the
real options theory, growth opportunities are likely to have higher exposure to market conditions, and hence
higher market betas. Finally, the literature also connects growth opportunities to the firms’ idiosyncratic
risk, appealing to the common assumption that there is more uncertainty about firms’ growth opportunities
than their assets in place (see, e.g., Myers and Majluf, 1984; Bartram, Brown, and Stulz, 2011). In addition,

2

model of Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011) by allowing the arrival rate of firms’ investment
opportunities to be unobservable. Market participants learn about firms’ future growth
opportunities from public signals and firms’ investment decisions. This learning channel has
two important effects. First, it formalizes the idea that revelation of information about firms’
future growth opportunities contributes to their return variation. Second, due to learning,
firms’ past investment rates are informative about their future investment opportunities and
their future expected stock returns.
Our calibrated model replicates key features of asset prices. First, our model generates
empirically plausible average return spreads between firms with high and low Tobin’s Q,
investment rates, earnings-to-price ratios, market betas, and idiosyncratic volatility. Second,
it replicates the existence of the common return factor among the portfolios sorted on these
characteristics and the resulting failure of the CAPM to price the portfolio returns. Third,
the same mechanism based on asset composition that leads to cross-sectional dispersion
in risk premia also leads to time-variation in the aggregate equity premium. As a result,
variables that are correlated with the aggregate fraction of growth opportunities to firm
value – aggregate investment rate and valuation ratios – forecast excess returns on the market
portfolio.5 A key parameter in our calibration is the price of IST shocks, which we assume to
be negative. We show that a negative price of risk for IST shocks implies that risk premia on
stock market dividend strips are declining with maturity. In particular, a positive IST shock
leads to a decline in short-term dividends as investment outlays rise, and to an increase in
long-term dividends due to a higher rate of capital accumulation. This differential IST-shock
exposure among different tenors of aggregate dividends implies that the term structure of
equity risk premia is downward sloping.
Comin and Philippon (2006) relate the rise in idiosyncratic volatility to the increasing importance of research
and development, which has a natural relation to the firms’ growth opportunities. Hence, ceteris paribus,
firms with more growth opportunities are likely to have higher idiosyncratic volatility.

See Cochrane (2011) for a summary of recent evidence for return predictability.

Our model’s implications for asset prices are supported by the data. Using proxies for the
IST shock, we find that differences in IST exposures among the test portfolios account for a
significant portion of their average return spreads. In addition, we explore to what extent
IST shock exposures can reduce the predictive power of firm characteristics in cross-sectional
regressions. In our model, return covariances and firm characteristics are jointly determined
by firms’ growth opportunities and assets in place. Hence, firm characteristics forecast
returns because they forecast future return exposure to IST shocks. In empirical tests, firm
characteristics often dominate conventional empirical risk measures, or at least add nontrivial
explanatory power. We argue that this finding is partly driven by the difficulty of accurately
estimating risk exposures using stock return data alone. In particular, both in the data and
in the model, estimated risk exposures using stock return data alone are too noisy to drive
out characteristics in Fama-McBeth regressions. However, using predicted risk exposures,
constructed as linear functions of characteristics and stock return betas, significantly reduces
the incremental power of characteristics to forecast average returns.
We explore the testable implications of our core mechanism for real economic variables
– firm investment decisions and output growth. In particular, firms with more growth
opportunities increase their investment by a greater amount following a positive IST shock.
Such firms also experience higher subsequent output growth relative to firms with few growth
opportunities as a result of their faster capital accumulation. We find support for both of
these predictions in the data. Following a positive IST shock, firms with high Tobin’s Q, high
investment rates, low earnings-to-price, high market beta, and high idiosyncratic volatility
increase their investment by more and experience higher future output growth relative to their
peers. The magnitude of these effects in the data is comparable to the patterns produced by
our calibrated model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature.
Section 3 presents the theoretical model. Section 4 describes the empirical procedures and
4

calibration. Section 5 compares the patterns in historical data to simulated model output. In
Section 6, we test the model’s implications for investment and output. In Section 7 we derive
additional predictions of our model for return predictability and the term structure of risk
premia. We briefly describe robustness tests in Section 8. Section 9 concludes.

Related Research

The empirical literature linking average returns and firm characteristics is extensive. Related
to our study, Basu (1977) and Haugen and Baker (1996) document the relation between
profitability and average returns; Fama and French (1992) and Lakonishok, Shleifer, and
Vishny (1994) study market-to-book and earnings-to-price ratios; Titman, Wei, and Xie
(2004) and Anderson and Garcia-Feijo (2006) relate investment to average returns; Ang,
Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006, 2009) document the negative relation between idiosyncratic
volatility and average returns; and Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972), Frazzini and Pedersen
(2010) and Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2011), among others, document that the security
market line is downward sloping. In this paper we show that all of the above empirical
patterns are related to each other, and propose differences in the firms’ exposures to IST
shocks as a common source of return comovement and cross-sectional differences in expected
returns.
A number of models with production relate average returns to investment rates or valuation
ratios.6 Our model shares some of the features of these models, namely that variation in
the firms’ mix of assets in place and growth opportunities leads to heterogeneous and timevarying risk exposures. However, most of the existing models feature a single aggregate
shock, implying that firms’ risk premia are highly correlated with their conditional market

betas.7 As a result, return factors constructed by sorting firms on various characteristics
are conditionally perfectly correlated with the market portfolio. Hence, these models fail to
capture the patterns of return comovement in the cross-section, and the resulting failure of
the conditional CAPM (e.g., Lewellen and Nagel, 2006).
The difficulty of standard models in reproducing the negative relation between market
betas and future returns has led to several recent explanations based on market frictions (e.g.,
Frazzini and Pedersen, 2010; Baker et al., 2011; Hong and Sraer, 2012). However, explanations
based on deviations of market values from fundamentals need additional assumptions to
generate comovement of firms with similar characteristics. Furthermore, we provide evidence
that this comovement in stock returns is related to comovement in real economic variables –
firm investment rates and output growth – consistent with the mechanism operating through
the real channel.
Our paper adds to the growing literature in macroeconomics and finance on the role
of investment-specific technology shocks. Investment-specific shocks capture the idea that
technical change is embodied in new equipment.8 Starting with Solow (1960), a number of
economists have proposed embodied technical change as an alternative to the disembodied
7

There are a number of exceptions: Berk et al. (1999) assume that firms’ value is affected by productivity
and discount rate shocks; Ai et al. (2011) and Ai and Kiku (2011) study models with both short-run and
long-run productivity shocks. However, these papers do not focus on return comovement as their primary
object of interest. Our model shares some of the key conceptual elements with the framework of Berk et al.
(1999), but emphasizes a different source of aggregate risk, embodied technical change. The closest paper to
our work is Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011). We extend the analysis in Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011) to
allow for learning about firms’ growth opportunities, and provide evidence that differential exposure to IST
shocks accounts for a number of other stylized empirical patterns in addition to the value premium.

The magnitude of investment-specific technical progress can be inferred from the decline in the qualityadjusted price of investment goods. A classic example is computers. In 2011, a typical computer server costs
$5,000. In 1960, a state of the art computer server (e.g., the Burroughs 205), cost $5.1 million in 2011 dollars.
Furthermore, adjusting for quality is important: a modern computer server would cost $160.8 million in 1960,
using the quality-adjusted NIPA deflator for computers and software. Greenwood (1999) offers numerous
additional examples of investment-specific technological change since the industrial revolution: Watt’s steam
engine, Crompton’s spinning mule, and the dynamo. These innovations were embodied in new vintages of
capital goods, hence they required substantial new investments before they could affect the production of
consumption goods.

technology shocks assumed by most macroeconomic models.9 Cummins and Violante (2002)
document significant instances of investment-specific technical change in numerous industries.
In macroeconomics, a number of studies have shown that IST shocks can account for a large
fraction of output and employment variability, especially in the long run (e.g., Greenwood,
Hercowitz, and Krusell, 1997, 2000; Christiano and Fisher, 2003; Fisher, 2006; Justiniano,
Primiceri, and Tambalotti, 2010). Given that stock prices are particularly sensitive to lowfrequency movements in fundamental variables (see, e.g. Bansal and Yaron, 2004), IST shocks
are likely to be an important driver of asset prices. Furthermore, since IST advances improve
real investment opportunities in the economy, they naturally have a differential impact on
growth opportunities of firms and their assets in place. Papanikolaou (2011) demonstrates
that in a general equilibrium model, IST shocks are positively correlated with the stochastic
discount factor under plausible preference specifications, implying a negative price of risk for
IST shocks.

Model

We relate observable firm characteristics, such as a firm’s beta with the market portfolio,
idiosyncratic volatility, investment rate and profitability, to stock return exposures to a
systematic sources of risk – investment-specific technical change – using a structural model.
Our model has two aggregate shocks: a disembodied productivity shock and an investmentspecific shock (IST). Assets in place and growth opportunities have the same loading on the
disembodied shock, but different loadings on the IST shock. This differential sensitivity to IST
shocks leads to return comovement among firms with similar ratios of growth opportunities
to firm value. Furthermore, given that investment shocks are priced, this heterogeneity in
9

Solow (1960, p.91) expresses scepticism about disembodied technology shocks: “...This conflicts with
the casual observation that many, if not most, innovations need to be embodied in new kinds of durable
equipment before they can be made effective. Improvements in technology affect output only to the extent
that they are carried into practice either by net capital formation or by the replacement of old-fashioned
equipment by the latest models...”

7

risk translates into cross-sectional differences in risk premia across firms based on the fraction
of firm value derived from growth opportunities.
Thus, our model links firm characteristics to the share of growth opportunities in firm
value. A key part of the mechanism is that firms’ growth opportunities are difficult to observe.
Hence, we extend the structural model of Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011) to incorporate
learning about firms’ growth opportunities. To make the exposition largely self-contained,
we describe all the elements of the model below, but we refer the readers to Kogan and
Papanikolaou (2011) for proofs of some of the technical results.

3.1

Setup

There are two sectors of production, a sector producing consumption goods and a sector
producing investment goods. Each sector features a continuum of measure one of infinitely
lived competitive firms financed only by equity. During most of our analysis we focus on the
sector producing consumption goods. We use the investment-goods sector to construct a
factor mimicking portfolio for IST shocks.
Assets in Place
Each consumption firm owns a finite number of individual projects. Firms create projects
over time through investment, and projects expire randomly.10 Let F denote the set of firms
and Jf t the set of projects owned by firm f at time t.
Project j produces a flow of output equal to
yf jt = ujt xt Kjα ,

(1)

where Kj is physical capital chosen irreversibly at the project j’s inception date, ujt is the
10
Firms with no current projects may be seen as firms that temporarily left the sector. Likewise, idle firms
that begin operating a new project can be viewed as new entrants. Thus, our model implicitly captures entry
and exit by firms.

8

project-specific component of productivity, and xt is the disembodied productivity shock
affecting output of all existing projects. There are decreasing returns to scale at the project
level, α ∈ (0, 1). Firm’s projects expire independently at rate δ.
The project-specific component of productivity u follows a mean-reverting, stationary
process, while the process for the disembodied shock x follows a Geometric Brownian motion,
√
dujt = θu (1 − ujt ) dt + σu ujt dBjt ,
dxt = µx xt dt + σx xt dBxt ,

(2)
(3)

where dBjt and dBxt are independent standard Brownian motions.
Investment
Consumption firms acquire new projects exogenously according to a Poisson process with a
firm-specific arrival rate λf t . At the time of investment, the project-specific component of
productivity is at its long-run average value, ujt = 1.
The firm-specific arrival rate of new projects has two components:
λf t = λf · λ̃f,t .

(4)

The first component of firm arrival rate λf is constant over time. In the long run, λf
determines the size of the firm. The second component of firm arrival rate λ̃f t captures the
current growth state of the firm. We assume that λ̃f t follows a two-state, continuous-time
Markov process with transition probability matrix between time t and t + dt given by
P =

1 − µL dt
µL dt
µH dt
1 − µH dt

!
.

(5)

Thus, at any point in time, a firm can be either in the high-growth (λf · λH ) or in the
low-growth state (λf · λL ), and µH and µL denote the transition rates between the two states.

9

Without loss of generality, we impose the normalization E[λ̃f,t ] = 1.11 Hence, λf denotes the
average project arrival rate of firm f .
When presented with a new project at time t, a firm must make a take-it-or-leave-it
decision. If the firm decides to invest in a project, it chooses the associated amount of capital
Kj and pays the unit investment cost pIt = zt−1 xt . The price of investment goods relative
to the average productivity of capital depends on the stochastic process zt , which follows a
Geometric Brownian motion
dzt = µz zt dt + σz zt dBzt ,

(7)

where dBzt · dBxt = 0. The z shock is the embodied, investment-specific shock in our model,
representing the component of the price of capital that is unrelated to its current level of
average productivity x. A positive change in z reduces the cost of new capital goods and
thus leads to an improvement in investment opportunities.

3.2

Learning

In contrast to Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011), we assume that the firm-level arrival rate λf t
is not perfectly observable. Market participants observe a long history of the economy, hence
they know its long-run mean λf . However, they do not observe whether the firm is currently
in the high-growth or low-growth phase. Thus, λ̃f t is an unobservable, latent process.
The market learns about the firm’s growth opportunities through two channels. First,
market participants observe a noisy public signal ef t of λf t ,
def t = λf t dt + σe dZfet .
Second, the market updates its beliefs about λf t by observing the arrivals of new projects.
11

This normalization leads to the parameter restriction
1 = λL +

(λH − λL ).

(6)

We derive the evolution of the probability pf t that the firm is in the high growth state

dpf t = (1 − pf t )µH − pf t µL dt + pf t λf λH − λ̄f t dMf t + he dZ̃fet ,

(8)

where he = σe−1 is the precision of the public signal and λ̄f t = pf t λf λH + (1 − pf t )λf λL is
the market’s unbiased estimate of the arrival rate of the firm’s investment opportunities. The
stochastic processes Z̃ e and M are martingales, given by

where Nf t denotes the cumulative number of projects undertaken by the firm. Hence, the
market learns about λf t using the demeaned public signal Z̃fet . In addition, the market adjusts
its beliefs about λf t upwards whenever the firm invests (dNf t = 1).

3.3

Valuation

We denote the stochastic discount factor as πt . For simplicity, we assume that the two
aggregate shocks xt and zt have constant prices of risk, γx and γz respectively. The risk-free
interest rate rf is also constant. Then,
dπt
= −rf dt − γx dBxt − γz dBzt .
πt

(11)

The factor structure of the stochastic discount factor is motivated by the general equilibrium model with IST shocks in Papanikolaou (2011). IST shocks endogenously affect the
representative household’s consumption stream, and hence they are priced in equilibrium.
Firms’ investment decisions are based on a tradeoff between the market value of a new

11

project and the cost of physical capital. Given (11), the time-t market value of an existing
project j is equal to the present value of its cashflows

The optimal investment decision follows the NPV rule: firm f chooses the amount of
capital Kj to invest in project j to maximize it’s net present value
N P Vjt = max p(1, xt , Kj ) − pIt Kj .

Because the marginal productivity of capital in (1) is infinite at the zero capital level, it is
always optimal to invest a positive and finite amount. The optimal capital investment in the

Equation (14) illustrates the relation between the optimal level of investment K ∗ and the
ratio of the market value of a new project p(1, x, K) to the cost of capital pI . This ratio
bears similarities to the marginal Q in the Q-theory of investment. However, in contrast
to most Q-theory models, optimal investment depends on the market valuation of a new
project, which in general is not directly linked to the market valuation of the entire firm.
Furthermore, the relation in (14) holds conditional on the firm having the opportunity to
invest. That is yet another reason why the firm’s marginal (or average) Q is not a sufficient
statistic for the optimal investment in our model, since investment depends on the firm’s
current investment opportunities λf t .
The market value of a firm is the sum of the value of its existing projects and the value
of its future growth opportunities. Following the standard convention, we call the first

12

component of firm value the value of assets in place, V APf t , and the second component the
present value of growth opportunities, P V GOf t . The value of a firm’s assets in place is the

This differential sensitivity to IST shocks has implications for stock return comovement and

sensitivity to the IST shock is a function of the ratio of growth opportunities to firm value.
Moreover, the firm’s asset mix between growth opportunities and assets in place determines

Whether firm’s expected returns are increasing or decreasing in the share of growth opportunities in firm value depends on the risk premium attached to the IST shock, γz .12
The ratio of the firm’s growth opportunities to its total market value, P V GO/V , evolves
endogenously as a function of the firm-specific project arrival rate λf t , the history of project
arrival and expiration, and the project-specific level of productivity u. In the short run, firms
with a large expected number of new projects λf t relative to the number of active projects are
likely to be firms with high growth opportunities. In addition, firms with productive existing
projects (high u) are more likely to be firms where the value of assets in place accounts for a
larger share of firm value.
12

Most equilibrium models imply a positive price of risk for disembodied technology shocks, so γx > 0. The
price of risk of the IST shock γz depends on preferences. Papanikolaou (2011) shows that under plausible
preference parameters, states with low cost of new capital (high z) are high marginal valuation states,
which is analogous to a negative value of γz . In Papanikolaou (2011), households attach higher marginal
valuations to states with a positive IST shock because in those states households substitute resources away
from consumption and into investment. We infer the price of risk of IST shocks from the cross-section of
stock returns. In particular, growth firms, which derive a relatively large fraction of their value from growth
opportunities, have relatively high exposure to IST shocks and relatively low expected excess returns. This
implies that the market price of IST shocks is negative.

14

To the extent that the ratio P V GO/V is correlated with observable firm characteristics,
our model implies that portfolios of firms sorted on these characteristics exhibit dispersion
in risk premia. Furthermore, long-short portfolios formed on various characteristics are
conditionally spanned by the IST shock z. Consequently, each of these long-short portfolios,
together with the market portfolio, spans the two systematic sources of risk in the model, x
and z.

Investment Sector

There is a continuum of firms producing new capital goods. The investment firms produce
the demanded quantity of capital goods at the current unit price pIt , and have a constant
profit margin φ. Given (11), the price of the investment firm is given by

(23)

A positive IST shock z benefits the investment-good producers. Even though the price of
their output declines, the elasticity of investment demand with respect to price is greater than
one, so their profits increase. Hence, we can use the relative stock returns of the investment
and consumption good producers to create a factor-mimicking portfolio for the IST shock.

3.5

Growth Opportunities and Firm Characteristics

Our model maps the ratio of growth opportunities to firm value into observable firm characteristics. Any particular characteristic is an imperfect proxy for growth opportunities, and
the sign of its relation with P V GO/V may be ambiguous. However, our model connects
several distinct firm characteristics to the same economic mechanism, heterogeneous exposure of assets in place and growth opportunities to IST shocks, through a common set of
structural parameters. Thus, by simultaneously reproducing empirical stock return patterns
in relation to various firm characteristics in our model, we confirm that its core mechanism is

15

quantitatively plausible.

Average Q is a noisy measure of growth opportunities, since it also depends on the profitability
of existing projects through V AP /B. The relation between Q and P V GO/V is positive if
cross-sectional differences in growth opportunities, and not the differences in profitability of
existing projects, are the dominant source of variation in Tobin’s Q across firms.
Investment rate
The firm’s investment rate, measured as the ratio of capital expenditures to the lagged
replacement cost of its capital stock, Bf t , is related to the ratio of growth opportunities to
firm value. Specifically, a firm’s investment over an interval [t, t + ∆ is equal to the cumulative
capital expenditures

In our model, there is both a cross-sectional and a time-series relation between investment
and average returns. In the cross-section of firms, firms with more growth opportunities
tend to have higher investment rates. Moreover, when a given firm acquires a project, the
market revises upward its estimate of the firm’s growth opportunities (see equation (8)). Both
of these channels imply a positive relation between P V GO/V and firms’ past investment
rates. However, project acquisition also increases the value of assets in place, which has an
16

offsetting effect. The net effect of investment on the relative value of growth opportunities
thus depends on the structural parameters and the current state of the firm. In particular, firm
investment tends to be positively correlated with P V GO/V in the cross-section if differences
in P V GO/V among firms are sufficiently large.
This mechanism linking investment rates to risk premia is new, and conceptually different
from the mechanisms proposed in other studies. In particular, in Carlson et al. (2004) and
Carlson, Fisher, and Giammarino (2006) growth opportunities have higher risk premia than
assets in place. Investment converts growth opportunities to assets in place, so following an
increase in investment, the same firm has a higher mix of V AP/V and therefore lower risk
premia. In our model, the opposite is true, that is, growth opportunities have lower risk premia
than assets in place, consistent with the empirical evidence on the value premium. In Zhang
(2005) and Bazdrech et al. (2009), operating leverage leads to a negative relation between
productivity and systematic risk, as captured by market beta. Consequently, investment –
which is increasing in firm productivity – is negatively related to market beta and therefore
risk premia.
Earnings-to-Price
A number of studies in the empirical literature have documented that firm earnings scaled
by the market value of equity are related to average returns (e.g., Basu (1977), Fama and
French (1992)). To explore this relation in light of our model, note that the value of assets in
place increases in the output of current projects

17

In our model firms have no production costs, hence Y also represents their earnings. Thus,
sorting firms on Y /V is analogous to sorting them on their earnings-to-price ratios in the
data. Equation (27) implies that such a sort approximately ranks firms by the ratio of the
value of their assets in place to the total firm value, V AP/V , which is inversely related to
P V GO/V .
Furthermore, a number of studies relate accounting-based measures of profitability, such
as return on assets, to future stock returns (see, e.g., Haugen and Baker, 1996). To explore
the ability of the model to replicate these relations, we form the equivalent of ROA by scaling
Y by the book value of capital B above. Intuitively, firms with more productive projects
(high u) are likely to have high accounting profitability ratios and thus higher share of assets
in place to firm value (V AP/V ).
Market Beta
Our model implies that a firm’s market beta is an increasing function of the share of growth
opportunities in firm value. In particular, the market portfolio, defined as the value-weighted
portfolio of all consumption and investment firms, is exposed to both the disembodied shock
x and the IST shock z

Vf t

(30)

where B0t > 0, B1t > 0 are functions of the structural parameters and VCt , P V GOCt and
VIt only. As a result, cross-sectional differences in market betas are positively related to
18

cross-sectional differences in growth opportunities.
Equation (30) implies that the relation between market beta and risk premia has the
same sign as the price of IST shocks, γz , which we estimate to be negative. This negative
relation illustrates the failure of the CAPM in our model. Absent any other form of risk
heterogeneity in our model, the security market line is downward sloping.

The relation between idiosyncratic volatility and the share of growth opportunities in firm
value is complex. The first term in equation (31) captures fluctuations in the project-specific
level of productivity (first part) and the potential decline in firm value due to expiration of
existing projects (second part). The second term in (31) also has two parts. The first part
captures the effect of project arrival on firm value. The second part reflects changes in firm
value due to the arrival of information about the firm’s growth prospects.
The sign of the relation between P V GO/V and firm’s idiosyncratic return volatility
depends on the relative strength of the various determinants of idiosyncratic return risk. If
firms hold sufficiently diversified portfolios of projects, then the first term is likely to be small.
In this case, firms with more growth opportunities will have higher idiosyncratic volatility, as
19

news about future investment opportunities are a dominant source of idiosyncratic risk.

Data and Calibration

Here we describe the empirical construction of the main variables and model calibration.

4.1

Measuring Investment-Specific Shocks

We focus on three measures of capital-embodied technical change directly implied by the
model. The construction of these measures closely follows Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011),
and we reproduce the key results here for completeness.
The first measure of IST shocks is based on the quality-adjusted price of new capital
goods, as in Greenwood et al. (1997, 2000). We use the quality-adjusted price series for new
equipment constructed by Gordon (1990) and extended by Cummins and Violante (2002)
and Israelsen (2010). We normalize equipment prices by the NIPA consumption deflator,
denoting the resulting price series by pIt . We de-trend equipment prices by regressing the
logarithm of pIt on a piece-wise linear time trend:
pIt = a0 + b0 11982 + (a1 + b1 11982 ) · t − ztI ,

(33)

where 11982 is an indicator function that takes the value 1 post 1982. The two-piece linear
trend accommodates the possibility of a structural break (see e.g. Fisher (2006)). When using
the equipment price series to measure investment-specific technology shocks, we approximate
them as ∆ztI .
Our model suggests a factor-mimicking portfolio for IST shocks. In particular, the
instantaneous return on a portfolio long firms producing investment goods and short firms
producing consumption goods (IMC portfolio) is spanned by the IST shock:
RtI − RtC = Et [RtI − RtC ] +

opportunities in the aggregate stock market value. To construct the IMC portfolio in the data,
we first classify industries as producing either investment or consumption goods according to
the NIPA Input-Output Tables. We then match firms to industries according to their NAICS
codes. Gomes, Kogan, and Yogo (Gomes et al.) and Papanikolaou (2011) describe the details
of this classification procedure.

4.2

Firm Characteristics

We now briefly describe the construction of the firm characteristics that we use in our
empirical analysis. Specifically, we measure the investment rate (IK) as the ratio of capital
expenditures (capx) to the lagged book value of capital (ppegt). We define Tobin’s Q as the
ratio of the market value of common equity (CRSP December market capitalization) plus the
book value of debt (dltt) plus the book value of preferred stock (pstkrv) minus inventories
(invt) and deferred taxes (txdb) divided by the book value of capital (ppegt). Following
common convention, we define the firm’s return on assets (ROA) as operating income (ib)
divided by lagged book assets (at). Last, we define the firm’s earnings-to-price ratio (EP) as
the ratio of operating income (ib) plus interest expenses (xint) to the market value of the
firm (mkcap + dltt + pstkrv - txdb).
We estimate the firm’s market beta (BM KT ) and IMC beta (IM C − BET A) using
weekly returns

in year t. We estimate idiosyncratic volatility from the two-factor specification (36) rather
than the market model (35) to ensure that our measure of idiosyncratic variance is not
mechanically reflecting variation in IMC betas across firms.

4.3

Calibration

Our model features a total of 18 parameters. Table 2 summarizes our parameter choices.
Some of these parameters are determined by a priori evidence. In particular, we set the project
expiration rate δ to 10%, to be consistent with commonly used values for the depreciation
rate. We set the interest rate rf to 3%, which is close to the historical average real risk-free
rate. We pick the price of risk of the IST shock γz = 0.57 to match the estimate of the price
of risk of IST shocks estimated using the cross-section of industry portfolios in Kogan and
Papanikolaou (2011). We verify that under this choice, the average return on the value factor
HML in the calibrated model matches the historical returns on the value factor constructed
using consumption-sector firms.
We select the next set of 15 parameters to approximately match 18 aggregate and firmspecific moments. While all of the model parameters jointly determine its properties, some
groups of parameters have particularly strong effect on certain aspects of the model’s behavior,
as we discuss below.
We pick the price of the disembodied shock γx to match the historical equity premium.
We choose the profit margin of investment firms φ = 0.075 to match the relative size of the
consumption and investment sectors in the data.
22

The parameters governing the projects’ cash flows (θu = 0.03, σu = 1.25) affect the serial
autocorrelation and the cross-sectional distribution of firm-specific profitability and Tobin’s
Q.
The parameters of the distribution of mean project arrival rates affect the average
investment rate and the cross-sectional dispersion of firm characteristics. We model the
distribution of mean project arrival rates λf = E[λf t ] across firms as a uniform distribution
λf ∼ U [λ, λ]. The parameters of the distribution of λf (λ = 5, λ = 25) affect the average
investment rate and the cross-sectional distribution of the investment rate, Tobin’s Q, and
firm profitability.
The dynamics of the stochastic component of the firm-specific arrival rate (µH = 0.05,
µL = 0.25, and λH = 5.1) affects the time-series autocorrelation and cross-sectional dispersion
of the firm-specific investment rates.
The parameter governing the precision of the public signal σe = 0.15 has a strong effect on
the correlation between firms’ investment and their past stock returns. The returns-to-scale
parameter α = 0.85 affects the sensitivity of investment to log Tobin’s Q.
We simulate the model at a weekly frequency (dt = 1/52) and time-aggregate the data to
form annual observations. We estimate the firms’ idiosyncratic volatility IVOL and BMKT
in simulated data using equations (35-36). We simulate 1,000 samples of 2,000 firms over
a period of 100 years. We omit the first half of each simulated sample to eliminate the
dependence on initial values. Unless noted otherwise, we report median moment estimates
and t-statistics across simulations.
In Table 3, we compare the estimated moments in the data to the median moment
estimates and the 5th and 95th percentiles in simulated data. In most cases, the median
moment estimate of the model is close to the empirical estimate.

Results

In this section, we explore the link between the model and the data. First, we document
that our model can replicate the observed differences in average returns associated with firm
characteristics. Next, we document that portfolios of firms sorted on these characteristics
exhibit a significant degree of return comovement. A single common return factor extracted
from the pooled cross-section of characteristics-sorted portfolios is related to IST shocks and
prices this cross-section. Last, we evaluate the extent to which characteristics forecast returns
because they proxy for IST risk exposures.

5.1

Firm Characteristics and Risk Premia

Here, we compare the properties of portfolios of firms sorted on characteristics in the model
to the data. In order to be consistent with our theoretical model, we restrict our analysis to
firms in the consumption-good sector. We describe the details in Appendix A.
Portfolios sorted on Tobin’s Q
Table 4 compares the stock return moments of portfolios sorted on Tobin’s Q in the data
(top panel) versus the model (bottom panel). Firm’s Tobin’s Q is closely related to the ratio
of the market value to the book value of equity, so the results of the top panel largely mimic
the findings of the literature on the value premium in stock returns. In particular, there is a
declining pattern of average returns across the Q-sorted portfolios. Furthermore, the high-Q
portfolios have higher market betas, implying that the CAPM fails to price this cross-section.
The portfolio long the top Q-decile firms and short the bottom Q-decile firms has an average
return of -8.8% per year and a CAPM alpha of -10.3%. Empirically, high Tobin’s Q portfolios
also have higher IMC-betas, which indicates that these portfolios have higher stock return
exposure to IST shocks.
The bottom panel of Table 4 shows that our model replicates the above patterns. In
24

the model, high-Q firms have higher ratios of growth opportunities to firm value. Hence,
high-Q firms have lower average returns, higher market betas, higher IMC-betas and higher
investment rates than low-Q firms, as we find empirically. These results are in line with
Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011), and we reproduce them here for completeness.
Portfolios sorted on earnings-to-price
We present moments of the decile portfolios sorted on the ratio of earnings to firm value (EP
) in the top panel of Table 5. Consistent with portfolio sorts on the earnings-to-price ratio
(e.g. Basu (1977), Fama and French (1992)), firms in the top EP decile outperform firms in
the bottom EP-decile by 8.9% per year. High-EP firms tend to have lower market betas than
low-EP firms and thus the CAPM fails to price this cross-section of returns. The long-short
position in the extreme EP-deciles generates a CAPM alpha of 10.2% per year. In the bottom
panel of Table 5, we repeat the same analysis on simulated data. Our model produces similar
patterns, with the portfolio long the highest EP decile and short the lowest decile generating
a spread in average returns of 7.2% and the CAPM alpha of 12%. Consistent with our model,
high-EP and low-EP portfolios also have large differences in IMC-betas.
For completeness, we also perform sorts on the accounting measure of profitability (ROA
), both in the data and in the model. As a firm characteristic, ROA is correlated with the
share of growth opportunities in the firm value, just like the EP ratio, but it is a more
noisy proxy for PVGO/V. As we see in Table 6, the pattern of average returns and firm
characteristics is similar in the data and in the model. Sorting on ROA produces dispersion
in average returns and CAPM alphas, but most of this dispersion comes from deciles 1 and
2. Moreover, empirically, the first two deciles also have much higher IMC-betas than the
rest, which lines up with the pattern of CAPM alphas across the ROA portfolios. Our model
replicates this pattern reasonably well. This profile of IMC betas suggests that ROA is most
informative about PVGO/V (ROA and PVGO/V are negatively correlated) when earnings

25

are low relative to book value.
Portfolios sorted on investment rate
The top panel of Table 7 presents the main empirical properties of the decile portfolios sorted
on the firms’ investment rate (IK). Consistent with the empirical findings of Titman et al.
(2004) and Anderson and Garcia-Feijo (2006), firms with high investment rates subsequently
earn lower average returns. The extreme decile portfolios (highest- versus lowest-IK firms)
have an average return difference of -4.9% annually. Furthermore, the high-IK portfolios have
higher market betas than the low-IK portfolios (1.56 for the highest IK-decile vs 0.94 for the
lowest decile). As a result, the CAPM misprices the IK portfolios, with a spread in CAPM
alphas of -8% between the extreme decile portfolios. High-IK portfolios also have higher
betas with the IMC portfolio than the low-IK portfolios. This suggests that the difference
in average returns among high- and low-IK firms is partially due to the differences in their
exposures to the IST shock.
The bottom panel of Table 7 shows the results in simulated data. The model replicates
the two key features of the data. The high-IK firms have lower average returns than low-IK
firms, with the 4.8% difference between the extreme deciles. At the same time, high-IK firms
have higher market betas than low-IK firms, thus our model replicates the failure of the
CAPM to price the IK portfolios.
Portfolios sorted on market beta
In the top panel of Table 8 we illustrate that the security market line is downward sloping,
consistent with the findings of Fama and French (1992), Frazzini and Pedersen (2010) and
Baker et al. (2011). Contrary to the predictions of the standard CAPM model, sorting firms
on their CAPM beta (BMKT) does not produce an increasing pattern of average returns
– the highest-BMKT portfolio has 2% lower average return than the low-BMKT portfolio.
Consequently, CAPM alphas of the extreme decile portfolios have a spread of -5.7% per year.
26

The difference in returns on the extreme BMKT decile portfolios is poorly spanned by the
market portfolio (R2 = 26%). Similarly to the sorts on ivestment rates and earnings-to-price
ratios, low-CAPM alpha portfolios (high-BMKT firms) have relatively high exposures to the
IST shock, measured by their IMC-betas.
High IMC betas of the high-BMKT firms indicate that these are high-growth firms.
Consistent with that view, we find that high-BMKT firms also have higher average investment
rates and higher Tobin’s Q than the low-BMKT firms. This positive relation between market
beta and either Tobin’s Q or investment rate is consistent with our model, but runs counter
to the prediction of production-based asset pricing models relying on operating leverage as
their main mechanism Zhang (e.g., 2005).
In the bottom panel of Table 8, we show that our model mimics the empirical properties of
BMKT-sorted portfolios. In the model, high-BMKT firms tend to be firms with more growth
opportunities, hence they have higher IST-shock exposures. The negative market price of IST
shocks implies that high-BMKT firms earn lower returns on average than low-BMKT firms.
In particular, the top-minus-bottom decile portfolio has an average return of -5.6% per year
and a CAPM alpha of -9%. The fact that the CAPM-alpha spread is larger in the model
than in the data is likely an artifact of all firms having the same exposure to the disembodied
shock. Relaxing this restriction of the model, for instance by introducing operating leverage,
would likely weaken the strong relation between BMKT and PVGO/V in the model.
Portfolios sorted on idiosyncratic return volatility
In the top panel of Table 9 we replicate the empirical findings of Ang et al. (2006, 2009).
Sorting firms on portfolios based on idiosyncratic volatility results in significant differences
in average returns and CAPM alphas. The top and bottom extreme deceil portfolios have
an average return difference of -5.9% per year. Furthermore, firms with high idiosyncratic
volatility tend to also have higher market betas. Consequently, CAPM alphas are large: the

27

difference in alphas between the extreme decile portfolios is -10.8%. In the bottom panel of
Table 9 we show that our model reproduces the negative relation between IVOL and average
returns, as well as the failure of the CAPM. The 10 minus 1 portfolio has an average return
of -5.2% and a CAPM alpha of -7.6%.
The model reproduces these findings because firms with high idiosyncratic volatility
are richer in growth opportunities and therefore have higher exposure to the IST shock.
Consistent with this prediction, in the data, firms with high idiosyncratic volatility have
higher betas with the IMC portfolio, higher investment rates and Tobin’s Q.

5.2

Return Comovement

In this section we show that portfolios constructed by sorting firms on the five characteristics
related to growth opportunities (Q, EP, IK, BMKT, and IVOL) exhibit substantial return
comovement that is not captured by their exposure to the market portfolio. In particular,
we first remove the effect of the market factor by regressing annual excess returns on these
portfolios on excess returns of the market. We normalize the residuals to unit standard
deviation, and extract the first principal component from the normalized residuals in each of
the five cross-sections. In addition, we extract the first principal component from a pooled
cross-section of twenty portfolios that includes portfolios 1, 2, 9, and 10 from each sort.13
As we see in Table 10, there is substantial comovement of firms with similar characteristics.
Within each set of ten portfolios, the eigenvalue associated with the first principal component
normalized by the sum of all eigenvalues ranges from 31% to 52%. These results show that
there are return factors within the cross-sections associated with each firm characteristic.
The existence of these return factors is often interpreted as an indication that CAPM alphas
associated with various firm characteristics could be generated by the exposure of firms to
13

As a robustness check, we have repeated the same analysis using monthly returns and the entire
cross-section of fifty portfolios, with similar results.

28

some source of systematic risk missing from the single-factor market model.
According to our theory, returns of firms with similar characteristics comove because
these characteristics are correlated with the firms’ IST-shock exposures. Empirically, we find
that the common factors extracted from portfolios sorted on each of the five characteristics
are highly correlated with each other (we remove the market component from each portfolio
return, so the return factors we extract are uncorrelated with the market returns). Table 10
shows that there is substantial comovement among these IK-, EP-, Q-, BMKT-, and IVOLfactors. As we see in Table 11, the first principal component P C1 is essentially the average
of long-short portfolios across the IK, EP, Q, BMKT, and IVOL sorts. The magnitude of
this common source of comovement is substantial: the normalized eigenvalue associated with
the first principal component from the pooled cross-section of twenty portfolios is 33%. The
correlation between each individual factor and the first principal component of the pooled
cross-section ranges from 47% to 92%. These results indicate the presence of a common
source of return variation across the portfolios sorted on various characteristics. For instance,
not only do high-IK firms comove more with other high-IK firms, but these firms also comove
with low-EP, high-Q, high-BMKT, and to some extent high-IVOL firms.
Most importantly, the common factor in characteristic-sorted portfolio returns is closely
related to the IST shocks. We compute correlations between P C1 and the measures of the
IST shock in the bottom panel of Table 10. The common factor extracted from the pooled
cross-section has correlation 69% with the IMC portfolio and 38% with the price of equipment
shock ∆z I .

5.3

Asset Pricing Tests

As a first pass, we check whether the common systematic risk factor extracted from all five
sets of characteristic-sorted portfolios (the first principal component, P C1) prices the returns
on each set of portfolios. In particular, we use a two-factor model including the market

29

portfolio and P C1. The P C1 factor earns a negative risk premium, with the annual Sharpe
ratio of -0.51, so that portfolios loading positively on this factor must earn relatively low
average returns. Table 13 shows that the two-factor model effectively captures the spreads in
average returns in the cross-sections sorted by Q, EP, IK, IVOL, and BMKT. In particular,
the factor model generates GRS test p-values (see Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989)) that
are greater than 10% in each of the cross-sections.
One limitation of the tests above is that they use the return factor constructed from the
cross-section of test assets, favoring the pricing models in finite samples. More importantly,
these tests focus on the pricing properties of the constructed return factor rather than on
its economic source. To link the cross-sectional dispersion in average returns directly to
dispersion in IST shock exposure, we form an equivalent of the linearized stochastic discount
factor (SDF) (11) in our model,
m = a − γx ∆x − γz ∆z.

(37)

We directly estimate how well the empirical proxies for IST shocks capture the average return
patterns in portfolios formed on firm characteristics by analyzing the pricing errors implied
by this SDF.
We estimate (37) using the generalized method of moments (GMM). We use the model
pricing errors as moment restrictions, namely, we impose that the SDF in equation (37)
should price the cross-section of test asset returns. The resulting moment restrictions are
E[Rie ] = −cov(m, Rie ),

(38)

where Rie denotes the excess return of portfolio i over the risk-free rate.14 We report first-stage
14

Since we use portfolio returns in excess of the risk free rate, the mean of the stochastic discount factor is
not identified. Without loss of generality, we choose the normalization E(m) = 1, which leads to the moment
restrictions (38). See Cochrane (2005, pages 256-258) for details.

30

GMM estimates using the identity matrix to weigh moment restrictions, and adjust the
standard errors using the Newey-West procedure with a maximum of three lags. As a measure
of fit, we report the sum of squared errors from the Euler equations (38). As test assets, we
use decile portfolios 1, 2, 9 and 10 from each of the five cross-sections (Q, EP, IK, BMKT
and IVOL).
We proxy for IST shocks with the relative price of new equipment, ∆z I . For the neutral
technology shock x, we use the change in the (log) total factor productivity in the consumption
sector from Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006). We also consider specifications of the SDF
based on portfolio returns. In particular, we use a linear combination of the market portfolio
with either the IMC portfolio, or the HML portfolio, both of which span the same linear
subspace as the two technology shocks x and z in the model. We normalize all shocks to unit
standard deviation.
We show the results in Table 14. Cross-sectional differences in the IST risk among the test
portfolios account for a sizable portion of the differences in their average returns. Columns
(1) shows that the specification with only the disembodied shock x produces large pricing
errors (4.23%), similar to the CAPM (3.61%). In contrast, adding the equipment-price shock
as a proxy for the IST shock in column (2) reduces the pricing errors to 0.92%. Furthermore,
adding IMC or HML portfolio returns to the market return in columns (4) and (5) reduces
the pricing errors to 0.75% and 1.40% respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the performance of
the factor pricing models considered in Table 14, comparing the model-predicted expected
returns on the test portfolios to their realized average returns in the data.
The market price of the IST shock in column (2) is negative, −1.35, and statistically
significant, which implies a negative relation between average returns on the characteristicsorted portfolios and their IST shock exposures. These point estimates are somewhat higher
than the numbers implied by our calibration, based on Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011),
but the calibrated parameter value for the price of IST shocks is still within the empirical
31

confidence interval.

5.4

Covariances, Characteristics and Risk Premia

In this paper we argue that firm characteristics (Q, IK, EP, BMKT, and IVOL) are correlated
with the firms’ exposure to IST shocks, and therefore related to risk premia. However,
IST shock exposures may be difficult to estimate using stock market data alone. Here, we
explore whether these firm characteristics help forecast IST risk exposures in addition to
direct measures of IST betas constructed using only stock returns. In the process, we try to
disentangle the direct effect of characteristics on average stock returns from their ability to
predict IST risk exposures.
IMC-beta and firm characteristics
IST risk exposures depend on growth opportunities, which are time-varying. We exploit
the fact that the IMC portfolio is a factor-mimicking portfolio for IST shocks and use IMC
betas as a measure of IST risk exposures. However, these betas are measured with error. To
evaluate whether firm characteristics are related to the true IST risk exposures, we regress
estimated IMC betas on their own lagged values and on firm characteristics Xf t :
imc
βfimc
t = a + γt + β Xf t−1 + ρ βf t−1 + ef t ,

(39)

where γt is a year fixed effect and X ∈ {Q, IK, EP, BM KT, IV OL}.
We show the results in the top panel of Table 15. We find that controlling for current
IMC betas, each one of the five characteristics has predictive power for the firms’ future
exposures to IST shocks. The last column of Table 15 shows that in a joint regression almost
all firm characteristics are still significant predictors of future IMC betas, with the exception
of EP.
Firm characteristics are informative about future IST risk exposures for two reasons. The

32

first reason is quite general: IMC betas are measured with error. If the measurement error is
i.i.d. over time, firm characteristics that are correlated with the true betas are informative,
even controlling for the statistical beta estimates. Second, IMC betas change over time,
hence past IMC betas, even abstracting from sampling errors, are not sufficient statistics for
the future IST exposures. Certain firm characteristics can help estimate changes in IMC
betas because they are measured as the end-of-period value in year t, whereas covariances
are measured using data over the entire year t. Hence, characteristics may contain more
up-to-date information about growth opportunities (and hence IST exposure) than realized
return covariances.
To illustrate these effects in the model, we replicate the predictive regression (39) in
simulated data. We show the results in the bottom panel of Table 15. In simulations, like
in the empirical data, firm characteristics help predict future IST shock exposures when
controlling for the recent return-based estimates of IMC betas.
Risk exposures versus characteristics
Prior research shows that the firm characteristics we consider in this paper predict future
stock returns. We now evaluate the extent to which this relation is driven by the fact
that characteristics are correlated with IST shock exposures. Furthermore, we compare the
empirical results to the output of the model, in which, controlling for the IST risk exposures,
firm characteristics contain no additional information about expected stock returns.
We frame our analysis as a Fama-MacBeth regression, with the right-hand-side variables
being i) firm characteristics; and ii) either lagged IMC-betas estimated using weekly return
data, or the forecasts of future IMC betas based on (39) using all of the characteristics.
We perform the same analysis on data simulated from the model, and show the results in
Table 16.
In the first column of the left panel, we see that each of the variables in question (Q, EP,

33

IK, IVOL, and BMKT) predicts future stock returns at the firm level. In the second column,
we see that the firm’s market beta is negatively related to future returns, even controlling for
each of the other four characteristics. Hence, not only does the CAPM fail, but variation in
market betas unrelated to the included characteristics is negatively correlated with future
returns. Including the firm’s past IMC beta (columns (3) and (4)) helps reduce the point
estimate on the firm characteristic, but the effect is marginal in most cases. In contrast,
firm’s predicted future IMC beta (columns (5) and (6)) substantially reduces the predictive
power of firm characteristics. In particular, controlling for market beta, the fitted IMC-beta
drives out idiosyncratic volatility and Tobin’s Q in predicting returns. Earnings to price
(EP) and investment rate (IK) retain statistically significant predictive ability, but the point
estimates are reduced by 30 to 70%.
We find that controlling for IST risk exposures, variation in market beta is associated
with a positive risk premium. Column (5) in the first panel shows that in the specification
containing the fitted IMC-beta and the market beta, the latter enters with a positive and
statistically significant risk premium of 5.8% annually, consistent with the magnitude of the
equity premium.
We compare the empirical results to simulated data in the right panel of Table 16. Columns
(1) and (2) show that characteristics forecast returns when controlling for market betas. In
addition, estimated IMC betas are noisy, even in simulated data. Hence, firm characteristics
are not driven out by IMC betas estimated using stock returns only, as we see in columns (3)
and (4). In contrast, using the IMC beta projected on firm characteristics largely eliminates
the relation between firm characteristics and average returns in simulated data.

6

Testing the Mechanism

In this section we provide further evidence that Tobin’s Q, IK, EP, BMKT and IVOL are
correlated with differences in growth opportunities among firms. Since growth opportunities
34

are not observable directly, we rely on indirect tests of the mechanism. In particular, our
model predicts that firms with more investment opportunities should increase investment
by a larger amount following a positive IST shock. In addition, firms with more growth
opportunities should exhibit an acceleration in output growth following a positive IST shcok,
as they acquire more capital.

6.1

IST Shocks and Comovement in Investment

We compare the investment response to IST shocks as a function of firm characteristics using
the following specification:
i f t = a1 +

5
X

ad D(Gf,t−1 )d + b1 ∆zt−1 +

d=2

5
X

bd D(Gf,t−1 )d ∆zt−1 + ut ,

(40)

d=2

where it is the firm’s investment rate; ∆zt ∈ {∆z I , Rimc , Rpc1 } is one of the three measures
of the IST shock; D(Gf )d is a dummy variable that takes the value one if the firm’s growth
opportunity measure Gf ∈ {Qf , IKf , EPf , BM KTf , IV OLf } belongs to the quintile d in
year t − 1. We standardize all right-hand side variables to zero mean and unit standard
deviation. We account for unobservable time and firm effects by clustering standard errors
by firm and year (see Petersen (2009)). To evaluate the ability of the model to quantitatively
replicate the data, we also estimate (40) using simulated data from the model.
As we see in Panel A of Table 17, in the model, following a positive IST shock, firms
with more growth opportunities (high Q, high IK, low EP, high BMKT and high IVOL)
increase investment by more relative to firms with fewer growth opportunities. In panels B
to D we explore this prediction of the model in the data, using different measures of the IST
shock. We find that in almost all cases, the empirical results support the model’s predictions.
Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect in the data is substantial: a one-standard deviation
z-shock leads to firms with more growth opportunities increasing investment by 0.31 to 1.56%
relative to firms with low growth opportunities. For comparison, the median investment
35

rate in our sample is 11%. In simulated data, the corresponding magnitudes are a bit larger
(1.3-2.4%), but still comparable.

6.2

IST Shocks and Comovement in Firm Output Growth

A positive IST shock implies that new projects are more productive relative to existing
projects. Therefore, following a positive IST shock, firms with more growth opportunities
should experience higher output growth than low-growth firms. To the extent that firm
characteristics such as Tobin’s Q, IK, EP, BMKT, and IVOL are correlated with P V GO/V ,
we expect these characteristics to capture the differential sensitivity of output growth to IST
shocks.
We estimate the response of output growth to the IST shock using the following specification:
ln yf,t+k −ln ȳt+k

5
5
X
X
ad D(Gf,t−1 )d +b1 ∆zt +
bd D(Gf t )d ∆zt +ρ (ln yf t − ln ȳt )+uf,t+k ,
= a0 +
d=2

d=2

(41)
where yf,t is firm output, defined as firm sales (sale) plus change in inventories (invt);
ȳ is average output across firms; G ∈ {Q, IK, EP, IV OL, BM KT } is the set of firm
characteristics; ∆zt ∈ {∆z I , RIM C } is our measure of IST shocks normalized to unit standard
deviation; and D(Gf t−1 )d is a quintile dummy variable. We control for industry fixed effects
in the regression and cluster standard errors by firm and by year.
The coefficient of interest is b5 (k), which captures the differential impact of an IST shock
on k-period output growth between firms in the top (G5 ) and the bottom (G1 ) quintile. For
brevity, we present results with the real proxy for IST shocks constructed using the price of
equipment (∆z I ), but we obtain similar results using returns to the IMC portfolio or the
common factor PC1.
We estimate equation (41) for horizons of 1 to 6 years. We plot the estimated b5 (k)

36

coefficients along with the 90% confidence intervals. To evaluate the connection with the
model, we perform the same exercise in simulated data and plot the median coefficient
estimates b5 (k), along with the 5th and 90th percentiles across simulations.
We present results in the top (data) and bottom (model) panels of Figure 2. Our findings
are consistent with the mechanism. Specifically, we find that a positive IST shock z leads to
a differential increase in output growth of firms with more growth opportunities, as measured
by high Tobin’s Q, IK, BMKT, IVOL and low EP, relative to firms with fewer growth
opportunities. Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect in the model is comparable to the
empirical estimates.

7

Additional Predictions

We now discuss the predictions of our model for the behavior of aggregate discount rates. In
particular, the same mechanism in our model that links firm characteristics to risk premia also
leads to time-varying expected returns to the market portfolio. Furthermore, our assumption
that the price of IST shocks is negative implies that risk premia on dividend strips are
declining with maturity. Both of these predictions are consistent with empirical evidence.

7.1

Return predictability

In our model, expected returns on the market portfolio are time-varying. Even though
the model features constant price of risk for the two aggregate shocks x and z, the asset
composition of the market portfolio varies over time, leading to time-variation in its expected
excess return. In particular, applying equation (22) to the market portfolio,
1
α
P V GOCt + VIt
Et [RM t ] − rf = γx σx +
γ z σz
.
dt
1−α
VCt + VIt

(42)

The equity premium depends on the relative values of growth opportunities in the consumption
sector, P V GOC , the market values of the consumption sector, VC , and the investment sector,
37

VI . The fact that discount rates are time-varying implies that, in the model, price-dividend
and price-earning ratios predict returns with a negative sign, consistent with the data (see
e.g. Campbell and Shiller (1988)). Furthermore, the aggregate Tobin’s Q and investment
rate are positively correlated with the ratio of PVGO to V. Hence, a negative price of risk
for the IST shock γz implies that both Q and aggregate investment predict market portfolio
returns with a negative sign, as in the data (see, e.g., Cochrane, 1991).
To quantify the degree of return predictability generated by changes in asset composition,
we replicate return predictability regressions in simulated data. In particular, we estimate
k
X

rM,t+h =a(k) + b(k) xt + ut+h ,

h=1

where rM is the log gross market portfolio return and x is the log of a predictor variable. As
predictors, we use variables that have been empirically linked to subsequent stock returns: a)
the aggregate price-dividend ratio; b) the aggregate price-earnings ratio; c) aggregate Tobin’s
Q; and d) aggregate investment rate. We adjust the standard errors using the Newey-West
procedure, with a lag length equal to 1.5 times the number of overlapping observations. We
show the results for horizons of one to five years in Table 18. The estimated slope b(k) is
negative and statistically significant. In addition, the adjusted R2 ranges from 7% at the
horizon of one year, to 28% at five years. The magnitude of return predictability in the model
is in line with the magnitude in the data (see, e.g., Fama and French, 1988).

7.2

Term structure of risk premia

van Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012) provide evidence that short-term claims on the
dividend of the S&P 500 index have substantially higher average returns than the S&P 500
index itself. The authors interpret this finding as evidence that the term-structure of risk
premia is downward sloping, and argue that standard asset pricing models have difficulty
matching this fact (see, for instance, Campbell and Cochrane, 1999; Bansal and Yaron, 2004).
38

A downward-sloping term structure of risk premia is consistent with the models of Lettau
and Wachter (2007) and Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursa (2010). A key feature of
both of these models is that negative shocks to dividends are associated with subsequent
increases in expected dividend growth. In our model, this pattern of mean reversion arises
endogenously. In particular, a positive IST shock leads to firms reducing dividends to pay
for increased investment. In future periods, this increased investment bears fruit, leading to
higher future dividend growth.
To illustrate how this mechanism leads to a downward-sloping term structure of risk
premia, consider the price of a dividend strip, defined as a claim on the time-T aggregate
dividend

(44)

The first term in equation (43), which captures the contribution of existing assets to the
time-T dividend, is decreasing in maturity T due to discounting and has no exposure to the
IST shock. The second term captures the contribution to the time-T dividend of projects
acquired between time t and T (first term in brackets) and the time-T investment expenditures
(second term in brackets). This term in (43) is increasing in the maturity of the dividend
strip T and has positive exposure to the IST shock z. Therefore, a negative price of IST
shocks γz implies that risk premia are decreasing with maturity T . To illustrate that our
calibration produces a downward-sloping term structure of risk premia for dividend strips,
we plot the risk premium associated with dividend strips of maturities k = 1/12, . . . , 20 years
in Figure 3.

39

Furthermore, dividend strips with very short maturities have negative IST exposure,
since investment outlays exceed the cash flows generated from future projects. Consequently,
return volatility of dividend strips has a U-shaped pattern. In addition, since these short-term
maturities have the opposite IST shock exposure from the market portfolio, and the same
exposure to the disembodied technology shocks, their market betas are below one.

Robustness Tests

In this section we perform a number of robustness tests. To conserve space, we briefly
summarize the results and refer the reader to the Internet Appendix for details.
First, we explore whether our results are driven primarily by intra- or inter-industry
variation in firm characteristics. To clarify the relative importance of these two dimensions
of firm heterogeneity, we repeat our portfolio sorts within the Fama and French (1997) 17industry classifications. In this case, we find that our results on comovement and dispersion
in risk premia are similar or stronger for all the considered characteristics, with the exception
of IVOL. Sorting firms on IVOL within industries produces a significantly smaller spread
in average returns (2.2%) and CAPM alphas (4.7%) relative to the unconditional sort. In
addition, the first principal component extracted from the cross-section of within-industry
sorted firms is very weakly correlated with the other cross-sections. These results suggest
that there is substantial intra-industry variation in idiosyncratic volatility that is not related
to firms’ growth opportunities.
Second, we explore the potential effect of variation in leverage across the characteristicsorted portfolios. If firm leverage correlated positively with the fraction of growth opportunities
in firm value, then equity prices of firms with more growth opportunities would likely have
higher exposure to any systematic risk factor, not only to IST shocks. This is an unlikely
situation, since prior literature finds leverage to be negatively related to growth opportunities
(e.g., Barclay and Morellec (2006)). As we measure growth opportunities somewhat differently,
40

we directly explore this issue. We compute the median book leverage within each decile
portfolio and confirm using our methodology that leverage is, if anything, negatively related
to growth opportunities. Thus, our results agree with the prior findings in the literature, and
show that differential leverage is not an alternative explanation for our findings on return
comovement.
Third, we evaluate whether our results are driven by small firms. We repeat our analysis
after eliminating the bottom 20% of firms in terms of market capitalization every year. We
find that our results are similar and in some cases stronger on this sub-sample, and thus
unlikely to be driven by the smallest firms.
Fourth, we consider an additional empirical proxy for IST shocks – changes in the aggregate
investment-to-consumption ratio (as in Kogan and Papanikolaou (2011)). This measure
follows from our model, albeit it is a more complex empirical object than the model suggests.
We find that using this proxy for IST shocks leads to similar empirical findings.
Last, we focus on a subsample of firms that are more likely to be capital-intensive and
hence correspond more closely to the firm in our model. In particular, we perform our
empirical analysis excluding the firms that produce services (industries 14-17 according to
the Fama and French (1997) 17-industry classification scheme). We find that our results are
somewhat stronger in this subsample.

Conclusion

In this paper we describe the joint dynamics of firm investment decisions, profitability, and
stock returns in a structural model in which firms experience shocks to their productivity and
investment opportunities. We link several commonly used firm characteristics, such as Tobin’s
Q, investment rate, earnings-to-price ratio, market beta, and idiosyncratic volatility to the
firm’s growth opportunities. As a result, these characteristics are correlated with the firm’s
exposures to the aggregate investment-specific technology shocks, which helps explain stock
41

return comovement among firms with similar characteristics, and cross-sectional correlations
between the characteristics and average stock returns.
Understanding the economic sources of stock return comovement is important for further
progress in our analysis of stock market behavior. From the perspective of asset pricing,
this helps better interpret the properties of the empirical factor-based pricing models. From
the perspective of macroeconomics, additional progress on this front should promote a more
fruitful use of asset pricing data in studies concerned with the sources of aggregate fluctuations.
In this paper we aim to contribute on both fronts.

Table 1 shows the definitions of the variables used in empirical analysis and model simulations.

Sample
We omit firms with fewer than 50 weekly stock-return observations per year, firms producing
investment goods, financial firms (SIC codes 6000-6799) and utilities (SIC codes 4900-4949).
In our investment regressions we also exclude firms with missing values of CAPEX (Compustat
item capx), PPE (Compustat item ppent), Tobin’s Q, firms in their first three years following
the first appearance in Compustat, and firms with negative book values. Our sample contains
6,832 firms and 63,295 firm-year observations and covers the 1965-2008 period.
47

Portfolio construction
HML portfolio We construct a 2 × 3 sort, sorting firms first on their market value of equity
(CRSP December market capitalization) and then on their ratio of Book-to-Market (see above
for more details). We construct the value factor (HM L) as 1/2(SV − SG) + 1/2(LV − LG),
where SG, SV, LG and LV refer to the corner portfolios.
IMC portfolio We follow Gomes, Kogan, and Yogo (Gomes et al.) and Papanikolaou
(2011) and classify firms as investment or consumption producers based on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Income and Product Account (NIPA) tables. We classify
industries based on the sector to which they contribute the most value. We use the 1997
Input-Output tables to classify NAICS industries into investment or consumption producers.
We include common shares (shrcd=10,11) of all firms traded in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ
(exchcd=1,2,3).
Portfolios sorted on characteristics We sort firms annually into 10 value-weighted portfolios based on the past value of characteristic. We estimate β imc using weekly returns.
We include common shares (shrcd=10,11) of all firms traded in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ (exchcd=1,2,3). We restrict the sample to firms producing consumption goods, and
exclude financial firms (SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949). When using accounting variables for characteristics, we rebalance the portfolios on June of every calendar year.
When using moments of stock returns (MBETA, IVOL), we rebalance at the end of every year.

Table 3 compares sample moments to moments in simulated data. Stock return moments are estimated over
the sample 1963-2008. The moments of investment growth are estimated using the series on real private
nonresidential investment in equipment and software. Moments of firm-specific variables are estimated using
Compustat data over the 1963-2008 period, where we report time series moments of the investment rate and
cash flows over capital, Tobin’s Q and IMC-beta. Moments of dividend growth are from the long sample
in Campbell and Cochrane (1999). We construct the value factor (HML) in the consumption sector as
1/2(LV − LG) + 1/2(SV − SG) where LV , LG, SV , LG refer to the corner portfolios of a 2-by-3 sort on ME
and BE/ME using consumption firms only and NYSE breakpoints. We exclude firms producing investment
goods, financial firms (SIC6000-6799), and utilities (SIC4900-4949).

Table 6 shows characteristics for the 10 portfolios of firms sorted on profitability (see Table 1 for variable
definitions). The top panel shows results from actual data, the bottom panel shows results from data simulated
by the model. We report average returns in excess of the risk-free rate, as well CAPM alphas and univariate
post-formation betas with respect to the market portfolio, βtmkt , and the investment minus consumption
portfolio (defined in Appendix A), βtimc . Estimation is done at annual frequencies in both the model and

(SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949).

Table 10 shows return comovement across the five decile portfolio sorts, on IK, EP, IVOL, BMKT, and Q
(see Table 1 for variable definitions). We extract the first principal component from standardized return
residuals from a market model regression. We normalize the sign of the first principal component so that it
loads positively on portfolio 10 with the exception of the EP sort, where it loads negatively on portfolio 10.
In addition, we extract the first principal component from a pooled cross-section of 20 portfolios that includes
portfolios 1, 2, 9 and 10 from each sort. We show the correlation matrix of these principal components, along
with their correlations with IMC, HML and the real proxy for the IST shock ∆z I (Appendix A contains the
details of portfolio construction). We compute p-values based on 10,000 permutations, where we randomly
and independently permute the time-series order of each cross-section.

Table 11 reports loadings of the first principal component of the pooled cross-section on the extreme decile
portfolios sorted on IK, EP, BMKT and IVOL (see Table 1 for variable definitions). Estimation is done at
annual frequencies. The sample period is 1965-2008 and excludes firms producing investment goods, financial
firms (SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949).

Table 13 reports portfolio alphas and betas with respect to the two-factor model that includes the market
portfolio and the first principal component of the pooled cross-section (PC1, normalized to standard deviation
of 10%) of Q, IK, EP, BMKT and IVOL portfolios. See Table 1 for variable definitions. Estimation is done at
annual frequencies. The sample period is 1965-2008 and excludes firms producing investment goods, financial
59
firms (SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949).

Table 14 reports empirical estimates of γx and γz from the model SDF: m = a − γx ∆x − γz ∆z. We sort
firms on Q, IK, EP, BMKT and IVOL (see Table 1 for variable definitions), and use portfolios 1, 2, 9, and 10
from each sort, resulting in a total of 20 portfolios. See Appendix A and main text for more details. We use
annual data in the 1965-2008 period and report first-stage estimates and the sum of squared errors (SSQE)
along with 90%-confidence intervals around the point estimates computed using the Newey-West procedure
with 3 lags.

Table 16 reports results of Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions using lagged firm characteristics, lagged
point estimates of IMC beta (BIMC) estimated using equation (35) and contemporaneous fitted values of
\ using the regression model in the last column of Table 15. Estimation is done at annual
IMC beta (BIMC)
frequencies, with the stock return on fiscal year t defined as the stock return from June of calendar year t to
May of calendar year t + 1. The sample period is 1965-2008 and excludes firms producing investment goods,
financial firms (SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949).

Table 17 shows the differential response of investment of firms with different characteristics Gf ∈
{Q, IK, EP, BM KT, IV OL} on measures of the IST shock ∆z ∈ {∆z I , Rimc , P C1}, normalized to unit
standard deviation. We show the estimated coefficients b1 . . . b5 from equation (40), along with t-statistics
computed using standard errors clustered by firm and year. The sample period is 1965-2008 and excludes
firms producing investment goods, financial firms (SIC6000-6799) and utilities (SIC4900-4949).

Table 18 reports results of return predictability regressions in simulated data. In particular, we report
coefficients b(k) from
k
X

rM,t+h =a(k) + b(k) xt + ut+h

h=1

rM is log gross return on the market portfolio; x is the log aggregate price dividend ratio (panel a), aggregate
price-earnings ratio (panel b), aggregate Tobin’s Q (panel c), and aggregate investment rate (panel d).
Standard errors are computed using the Newey-West procedure with the number of lags equal to 1.5 times
the return horizon. Point estimates, t-statistics, and the R2 are median values across 1,000 independent
simulations of the model. For each simulated sample we start with 100 years of simulate data and omit the
first 50 years to eliminate the effect of initial conditions.

Figure 1 plots predicted expected returns versus realized average returns from four asset pricing models: A) the CAPM; B) the two factor model with
the market portfolio and PC1; C) the SDF implied by the model using two real proxies for the IST shock (column 2 of Table 14); and D) the SDF
implied by the model using portfolio returns (column 5 of Table 14). We consider the pooled cross-section of IK, EP, Q, BMKT, and IVOL portfolios.
