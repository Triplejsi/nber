ABSTRACT
We identify the major public debt overhang episodes in the advanced economies since the early 1800s,
characterized by public debt to GDP levels exceeding 90% for at least five years. Consistent with
Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) and other more recent research, we find that public debt overhang episodes
are associated with growth over one percent lower than during other periods. Perhaps the most striking
new finding here is the duration of the average debt overhang episode. Among the 26 episodes we
identify, 20 lasted more than a decade. Five of the six shorter episodes were immediately after World
Wars I and II. Across all 26 cases, the average duration in years is about 23 years. The long duration
belies the view that the correlation is caused mainly by debt buildups during business cycle recessions.
The long duration also implies that cumulative shortfall in output from debt overhang is potentially
massive. We find that growth effects are significant even in the many episodes where debtor countries
were able to secure continual access to capital markets at relatively low real interest rates. That is,
growth-reducing effects of high public debt are apparently not transmitted exclusively through high
real interest rates.

I. Introduction

Among the legacies of the recent financial crisis across the advanced economies is
a historically high and rising level of public indebtedness. The central policy debate
across Europe, Japan, and the United States now centers on how fast to stabilize soaring
public debt/income ratios given that post-crisis growth remains fragile. Those concerned
about the tentative nature of economic expansion argue that the risks from elevated richcountry government indebtedness are wildly overblown, except of course for
impecunious borrowers in the Eurozone periphery such as Greece. After all, market real
interest rates for the very largest economies are extraordinarily low. If markets are not
yet worried about long-term insolvency risks, why should policymakers? Shouldn’t
government tolerate even bigger deficits to counterbalance post-crisis private sector
deleveraging?1
The counter to such cyclical concerns is worry about the secular consequences of
high debt loads on economic performance. In this paper, we use recently developed longdated cross-country historical data on public debt levels to examine the long-term growth
consequences of prolonged periods of exceptionally high public debt, defined here to be
debt over 90% of GDP.2 In the event, the cumulative effects can be quite dramatic. Over
the twenty-six public debt overhang episodes we consider, encompassing the
preponderance of such episodes in advance economies since 1800, growth averages 1.2%
less than in other periods. That is, debt levels above 90% are associated with an average
growth rate of 2.3% (median 2.1%) versus 3.5% in lower debt periods. Notably, the
average duration of debt overhang episodes was 23 years, implying a massive cumulative

crises.

output loss. Indeed, by the end of the median episode, the level of output is nearly a
quarter below that predicted by the trend in lower-debt periods. This long duration also
suggests the association of debt and growth is not just a cyclical phenomenon.
Our work is not the first to use the new debt data to document the association
between high debt and low growth. Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) show periods where debt
is over 90% of GDP are associated with roughly 1% lower growth while at lower debt
thresholds, the correlation with growth is small. Kumar and Woo (2010) and Cecchetti,
Mohanty, and Zampolli (2011) also find statistical support of a similarly sized effect.
In this paper, we go beyond regressions and aggregative statistics to look at more
detailed evidence on each of the individual twenty-six episodes. Previous studies of high
public debt episodes have focused on the very small number of cases where debt data is
readily available, including mainly the post-World-War-II United States and United
Kingdom and contemporary Japan. Our historical approach allows us to more easily
discriminate between cases where high debt resulted from wars and cases where high
debt resulted from peacetime buildups and/or financial crises.
Importantly, this paper provides the first systematic evidence on the association
between high public debt and real interest rates. Contrary to popular perception, we find
that in 11 of the 26 debt overhang cases, real interest rates were either lower or about the
same as during the lower debt/GDP years. Those waiting for financial markets to send
the warning signal through higher interest rates that government policy will be
detrimental to economic performance may be waiting a long time.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a
brief tour of the evolution of the concept of debt overhangs in the literature; an appendix
that discusses the findings of individual papers complements this review. We next
3

present a snapshot of the various dimensions of the ongoing public and private debt
overhang in the advanced economies in both historical context and relative to
developments in emerging market economies. The topic of debt overhangs will be
relevant for policy discussions in the years ahead. The core analysis of the paper
documenting the features of the 26 debt overhang episodes we identify is presented in
Section III. We then examine links between debt, growth, and interest rates, and return to
summarize our evidence in the concluding section.
II. Preamble: Varieties of Debt Overhangs
Although our focus here is on public debt overhangs, it would be folly to ignore
the other debt burdens present today. These include private debt, external debt (including
both government and private debt owed to foreigners), and the actuarial debt implicit in
underfunded, or simply unfunded, old age pension and medical care programs. Each of
these forms of debt produces distortions that will, in general, slow growth.
High public debt, for example, can slow growth whether the adjustment comes
through higher distorting taxes or through lower government investment. The problem is
compounded if high debt elevates uncertainty about default. Such uncertainty, in turn,
raises interest rates (compounding the problem of distorting taxes) and further
discourages investment activity. Highly indebted consumers will cut back on
expenditures, potentially impacting growth through weaker aggregate demand. If
financial repression, or restrictions on finance designed to lower the real borrowing cost
of the government, is used to deal with a massive public debt overhang problem, as
Reinhart and Sbriancia (2010) argue was very important after World War II, the resulting
distortions will also impede growth. External debt creates a particularly acute overhang

4

problem because the country generally has a much narrower range of tools for reducing
the debt, since typically neither inflation nor financial repression is feasible.
In general, the interaction between the different types of debt overhang is
extremely complex and poorly understood. (An annotated bibliography on the literature
on various relevant forms of debt overhang is presented in Appendix I.) For example,
private debt often becomes partly absorbed into public balance sheets during major
financial crises, as for example occurred in Ireland after the recent financial crisis when
the government took on massive quantities of bank debt. We take the topic up of
multiple debt overhangs in more detail in a companion paper, Reinhart, Reinhart and
Rogoff (2012).
We limit ourselves here to presenting a snapshot of the various dimensions of the
ongoing public and private debt overhang in the advanced economies, placed in historical
context.
2.1. Public debt
Figure 1 presents average gross central government debt as a percent of GDP for
70 countries aggregated into advanced and emerging market economies subgroups from
1900 to 2011. The simple arithmetic averages presented for the two groups illustrate the
scale of the debt build-up in recent years among the wealthy economies. As noted in the
previous section, Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) place the threshold at which public debt is
associated with lower contemporaneous growth at about 90 percent for both advanced
and emerging economies; other studies with alternative methodologies and samples have
yielded estimates in that ballpark (Appendix Table 1). The fact that the 22 advanced-

5

economy average for 2011 shown in Figure 1 is just above the 90 percent benchmark
already anticipates that numerous countries are experiencing a “public” debt overhang.3

2.2. External debts: Public and Private
Figure 2 traces the trajectory of gross public and private external debt/GDP since
1970 for advanced and emerging market economies. The overlap and interaction is
particularly acute when it comes to external debt. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2009 and

3

It would be desirable to have long-dated measures of general government debt that include states and
municipalities. However, for long dated historical data, the Reinhart-Rogoff (2009) database only contains
central government debt. There is also the issue of net debt versus gross debt, with the main different being
government debt held by government-run old age support trust funds. This distinction has become much
more important recently as the trust funds have massively expanded. Again, net debt data is not available
on a long-dated cross country basis. However, per our arguments in the conclusions, the fact that net public
debt today tends to be significantly lower than gross public debt would do little to reverse our conclusions
since by and large the trust funds are woefully underfunded, and implicit tax liabilities in most pension
systems are hugely positive. These trust funds are hardly sources of future revenues to offset gross
government deficits.

6

2011) note, the record strongly indicated that private external debts are often absorbed by
the sovereign in a debt crisis.
Led by European countries, the surge in external debts since the early 2000s is
unprecedented in history and dwarfs the late 1970s - early 1980s lending boom to
emerging markets (shown in the inset to Figure 2).4 Reinhart and Rogoff (2010)
suggested a 60 percent threshold for emerging markets but did not have the comparable
data to conduct a parallel exercise for the advanced economies.5 We do this in a
companion paper (Reinhart, Reinhart and Rogoff, 2012) and find that the threshold for
advanced country external debt is roughly the same as for public debt—that is, 90 percent
of GDP. For Europe as a whole, public and private external debts are already more than
double the 90 percent threshold and constitute a considerable source of uncertainty.

4

Of course, this is partly because we (and others including the IMF) label debt across euro-zone countries
as external. This is clearly the best first approximation given the weakness of euro-wide institutions, but as
euro institutions are still stronger than many international counterparts, it may also be regarded as an
exaggeration.
5
Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) stress that for countries with a particularly poor credit history the
external debt threshold may be lower than the common 60 percent for the emerging markets as a whole.

2. 3. Private Domestic Debt
Figure 3 plots private domestic credit (essentially bank loans). Although this is an
incomplete measure of private credit, particularly for the United States with its highly
sophisticated capital market, this measure is most easily compared across time and
countries. Figure 4 compares two alternative approaches to measuring private leverage.
By either metric, the pre-crisis surge in domestic credit mimics the pattern discussed
earlier for external debt. This should not come as a surprise, as the literature on domestic
credit booms (see Mendoza and Terrones, 2011, for example) links these booms to
capital inflow surges (borrowing from the rest of the world).

2. 4. Summary
The scope and magnitude of the debt overhang (public, private, domestic and
external) facing the advanced economies as a group is in many dimensions without
precedent. As such, it seems likely that our historical estimates of the association
between high public debt and slow growth might, if anything, be understated when
applied to projections going forward.

10

IV. Features of Episodes of High Debt
While a more encompassing concept of debt overhangs that incorporates private
debt and allows for distinctions between external and domestic debts is the goal, we
confine ourselves to identifying public debt overhangs.6 We define a public debt
overhang as an episode where the gross public debt/ GDP ratio exceeds 90 percent for
five years or more. We identify 26 public debt overhang episodes in 22 advanced
economies since the early1800s. This tally does not yet include the unfolding post-crisis
cases in Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, and the United States, where the beginning
of the debt overhang dates to 2008 or later, and does not meet our five-year minimum
criterion. Among the ongoing episodes, our sample does include Greece, Italy and Japan,
where the beginning of the debt overhang (as defined above) dates back to 1993, 1988,
and 1995, respectively.
1. The episodes
Tables 1 and 2 list the episodes that fulfilled the criteria on magnitude and
duration of our definition of debt overhang. Table 2 also lists four shorter spells of high
debt (lasting less than five years) that were largely associated with war or a cyclical
downturn during the Depression of the 1930s.
The first column of Tables 1 and 2 lists the country. As noted, our analysis covers
22 advanced economies. Of these, nine countries have no episodes that meet our criteria
of a public debt overhang: Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland (not until 2009),
Norway, Portugal (not until 2010), Sweden, and Switzerland.7 The remaining 13
countries record one or more debt overhang episodes as shown in Tables 1 and 2. The
6

See Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) and Reinhart, Reinhart and Rogoff (2012).
The fact that many countries do not have any history of public debt/GDP above 90 percent helps explain
the finding in Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) that less than 10 percent of the post-WWII annual observations
of public debt/GDP for all advanced economies are above the 90 percent cutoff.

7

11

first row for each country gives the sample coverage (in the second column), which is
determined by data availability and varies by country. The next six columns provide
averages for real GDP growth, real (inflation adjusted) short term interest rates and real
long term interest rates. For each of these three variables, we provide the averages for
debt/GDP below and above 90 percent. Details on the interest rate and other data used
are provided in the Data Appendix. Column (9) provides a calculation of the share of
years in the total sample (shown for each country in column 2) where debt/GDP was
above 90 percent. For example, since 1848 (when the public debt data is available),
Greece sets the record, with 56 percent of the observations of debt/GDP ratios above 90
percent. The last column provides commentary on the debt overhang episodes, which are
listed separately in the rows below the country aggregates.
Table 1 is devoted to episodes lasting more than 10 years. For each country, there
is also a cross reference to Table 2 if the country had other debt overhangs in the 5-9 year
range. The next-to-last column lists the duration (in years) of each individual episode.
The comment entries direct particular attention to whether the debt buildup was
associated with a war or with some other event, such as any variation of a financial crisis
(banking, inflation, exchange rate, and debt) and also economic depression. Where
possible, we indicate peak levels of debt and interest rates and whether there were other
related events or arrangements in financial markets, such as a debt conversion or financial
repression.8

8

Financial repression includes directed lending to the government by captive domestic audiences (such as
pension funds or domestic banks), explicit or implicit caps on interest rates, regulation of cross-border
capital movements, and a tighter connection between government and banks, either explicitly through
public ownership of some of the banks or through heavy “moral suasion”. It is often associated with
relatively high reserve requirements (or liquidity requirements), securities transaction taxes, prohibition of
gold purchases (as in the US from 1933 to 1974), or the placement of significant amounts of government
debt that is nonmarketable. In principle, “macroprudential regulation” need not be the same as financial
repression, but in practice, one can often be a prelude to the other.

2. Causes and duration
As the commentary in the tables highlights, many debt overhangs are a direct
product of costly wars. There are distinct clusterings around World War II and, to a
lesser extent, World War I, which then merges with the Depression era debt build up; this
shows up as the three nearly consecutive peaks in the advanced economies’ aggregate
debt ratios shown in Figure 1. Hardly surprising, famously chronic high debt countries,
such as Greece and Italy, are tied for first place in the number of debt overhang episodes
(each has four episodes and the percent of years with an overhang is 56 and 48 percent,
respectively). It is somewhat more surprising that the two previous world powers, the
14

Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have so few debt overhang episodes (three and two,
respectively). This, however, is partly because the episodes that did occur lasted so long.
The Napoleonic wars, in particular, left a deep mark on the finances of both of them. In
the days before fiat currency, inflation and/or financial repression were not as prevalent
as after the end of World War II when it was institutionalized on a global basis under the
Bretton Woods system. Thus, the “liquidation” of government debt via a steady stream
of negative real interest rates was not as easily accomplished in the days of the gold
standard and relatively free international capital mobility as in 1945-1979. This meant
that it took a longer time to work down debt ratios in the 19th century. 9 However, while
the “inflation or financial repression tax” was used sparingly by the colonial powers of
the 19th century, other forms of “economic repression” were available. In particular,
there were substantial transfers from the colonies to finance debts and facilitate debt
reduction. During much of the 1800s, the Netherlands, for example, earmarked
Indonesian revenues for deficit reduction (Bos, 2007). There were also “usury laws” that
were the ancestors to the interest-rate ceilings that accompanied financial repression after
World War II (Homer and Sylla, 1996).
The “modern” peacetime episodes in the advanced economies are comprised of
Belgium, Canada, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Japan. Of these six, the shortest were Canada
and Ireland, lasting 8 and 11 years, respectively. Japan’s mounting public debts had their
origins in the systemic banking crisis of 1991 and asset (equity and real estate) collapse
that began somewhat earlier. 10

9

See Reinhart and Sbrancia (2011).
It can be conjectured that Greece, Ireland, and Italy’s debt build-ups may have been in part connected to
their efforts to reduce inflation as a prerequisite for joining the euro, as debt financing supplanted inflation
finance.

3. Public debt overhang and slow growth, with and without interest rate drama
Other than higher distorting taxes, the standard textbook connection between
public debt and growth emphasizes a risk premia channel. Sufficiently high levels of
debt call into question fiscal sustainability and lead to a higher risk premia and its
associated higher long term real interest rates. As several recent studies indicate (see
Appendix Table 1), the link between debt and growth appears to be nonlinear; similarly
the relationship between debt and alternative measures of risk (see Reinhart, Rogoff and
Savastano, 2003) is also nonlinear. The impact of sharply higher real interest rates, in
turn, has the usual negative implications for investment, consumption of durables and
other interest sensitive sectors, such as housing.
As noted in the introduction, for the countries that have one or more episodes of
public debt overhangs, real GDP growth averages 3.5 percent per annum over the full
period for which debt/GDP is less than 90 percent and data is available.11 The
comparable average for all debt overhang episodes is 2.3 percent (or 1.2 percent lower
than the lower debt periods). Median growth for the debt overhang episodes is 2.1
percent. Three debt overhangs episodes, however, are associated with higher GDP
growth.12
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the difference in growth and interest rates for the high
and lower debt buckets on a country-by- country basis. Diagram 1 and Figure 4 provide
further details on an episode-by-episode basis. Diagram 1 places the individual episodes
in the context of a two-by-two matrix. The rows divide the episodes into those debt
overhang episodes associated with average growth that is higher than the average growth

11

All figures cited exclude World War I and II years from the calculations. Individual country coverage is
detailed in Tables 1 and 2 and the Data Appendix.

for that country during all years in which debt/GDP was below 90 percent (upper row)
and those episodes where the comparable growth differential is negative (bottom row).
The columns perform a comparable division for episodes where real interest rates (long
bond) were higher (left column) and those where rates were lower. The middle insets
represent the cases where there was little differential in interest rates between the high
and lower debt periods.
As the textbook risk premia channel predicts, higher real interest rates are more
common than not during periods of high debt (15 of 26 episodes). However, as
Diagram 1 illustrates, a non-trivial share of the episodes are characterized by both lower
growth and lower or comparable real interest rates. This is left largely unexplored in
textbooks.
Furthermore, there is little to suggest a systematic mapping between the largest
increases in average interest rates and the largest (negative) differences in growth during
the individual debt overhang episodes. The growth and interest rate differentials for each
episode are plotted side-by-side in the two bar-chart panels of Figure 4. The left panel
plots (in descending order) the episodes by their growth differential; the right panel plots
the comparable real interest rate differential. At the top of Figure 4, Belgium’s post
World War I debt overhang from 1920-1926 is associated with a rebuilding boom that
left average growth 3.7 percent above the long-term growth average of 2.5 percent (for all
years in which debt/GDP is below 90 percent).13 A rare (for Belgium) post-war inflation
spike also produced very negative ex-post real interest rates (minus 8 percent). At the
other end, average post World War II GDP growth during the 6-year debt overhang
(1944-1949) is sharply lower as there was decommissioning of a global war effort and no

That is to say average GDP growth during 1920-1926 was 6.2 percent.

need to rebuild entire cities, as in Europe and Japan. More germane to the current
situation are the considerably longer peacetime debt overhangs (Figure 4) that, with the
exception of the United Kingdom at the height of its colonial powers, are consistently
associated with lower growth (in varying degrees), irrespective of whether real interest
rates rose, declined or remained about the same.

4. The cumulative effects of debt overhangs
Although it is obvious that a sustained growth shortfall of modest magnitude can
have massive cumulative effects, the point is so important that we feel compelled to
illustrate it with a simple numerical example. In Figure 5, we consider a 23-year window,
which is the average duration of the 26 episodes in our sample. We index base year (year
1) real GDP to equal 100. As the “no debt overhang-debt/GDP below 90 percent”
baseline case we apply a constant growth rate of 3.5 percent per annum (the blue line). At
the end of 23 years, the real GDP index rose from 100 to 221. The debt overhang path
(the red line) applies the 2.3 percent sample average constant annual growth rate over the
same horizon. At the end of 23 years the index rose from 100 to 169; real GDP is 24
percent lower than for the baseline. Even assuming a more modest reduction in growth
from 3.5 to 3 percent (this exercise is not shown in Figure 5), the level of GDP at the end
of 23 years would still be 11 percent lower than otherwise. It is not exactly what T.S.
Eliot had in mind when he wrote “This is the way the world ends, Not with a bang but a
whimper” but the general thrust appears to be applicable to the “debt-without-drama”
damages.14

V. Conclusions
The advanced world has entered an era characterized by massive overhang of
public and private debt. Public debt to GDP levels in advanced countries as a whole
already exceed our critical 90% threshold. Private debt, which in contrast to public debt
shows a marked upward trend over the past few decades, remains near pre-crisis levels.
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that among advanced countries, a record portion
of the debt is owed to external creditors, which in general limits a government’s tools for
forcing its creditors to absorb losses, either quickly or slowly through financial repression.
We identify 26 episodes of public debt overhang–where debt to GDP ratios
exceed 90% of GDP–since 1800.15 We find that in 23 of these 26 episodes, individual
countries experienced lower growth than the average of other years. Across all 26
episodes, growth is lower by an average of 1.2%. If this effect sounds modest, consider
that the average duration of debt overhang episodes was 23 years.
In 11 of the 26 high debt overhang episodes, real interest rates were the same or
lower than in other periods. Yet growth was similarly impaired, as we illustrated in a
side-by-side comparison (Figure 4).
One might argue that financial globalization has made it easier to carry high
public debt burdens, but we see no compelling evidence that this is the case for advanced
countries as a whole. Moreover, do not undercount the sophistication and
interconnection of national markets in the 19th century, half the timespan covered.
We have just noted that in contrast to private debt, there is no marked trend rise in
public debt, unless of course one includes contingent liabilities in old age support

15

The 90% threshold is identified by Reinhart and Rogoff (2010), who point out that a higher threshold
would leave relatively few observations. For example, on a yearly basis post World War II, just over 1% of
all gross central government debt to GDP ratios among advanced countries have exceeded 120%.

22

programs. Obviously, it is possible that new developments in technology and
globalization will provide such a remarkable reservoir of growth that today’s record debt
burdens will eventually prove quite manageable. On the other hand, the fact many
countries are facing “quadruple debt overhang problems”—public, private, external, and
pension–suggests the problem could in fact be worse than in the past, a question we do
not tackle here.16 Nor have we paid attention here to the likely possibility of significant
“hidden debts”, especially public sector, which Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) find to be a
significant factor in many debt crises, and as documented in detail in the Reinhart (2010)
chartbook.
Another line of reasoning for dismissing concerns about public debt and growth is
the view the causality mostly runs from growth to debt. The multi-decade long duration
of past public debt overhang episodes suggests that at very least, the association is not
due to recessions at business cycle frequencies. Others dismiss concerns about high debt
by citing the immediate period after World War II for the United States and United
Kingdom, and pointing to the fact that the United Kingdom had extremely high debt after
the Napoleonic Wars. Our analysis, based on these cases and the 23 others we identify,
suggests that the long term risks of high debt are real.
Finally, this paper should not be interpreted as a manifesto for rapid public debt
deleveraging in an environment of extremely weak growth and high unemployment.
However, our read of the evidence certainly casts doubt on the view that soaring
government debt is a non-issue simply because markets are presently happy to absorb it.

16

We take up the question of how debt overhangs interact in Reinhart, Reinhart and Rogoff (2012).

Main conclusions
A principal result is
that finance starts
having a negative effect
on output growth when
credit to the private
sector reaches 104 to
110 percent of GDP.
The strongest adverse
effects are for credit
over 160 percent of
GDP.
There is a strong
negative correlation for
Italy over the entire
sample but the
relationship is
somewhat weaker since
1985. The stronger
negative effect of debt
on growth prior to 1914
is importantly connected
to the larger role played
by external debt.
The estimated
thresholds for
government and
household debt are at 85
percent of GDP,
although it is less
precisely estimated for
the latter. Corporate
thresholds are somewhat
higher and close to 90
percent.
There is a nonlinear
relationship between
debt and growth. Most
specifications provide
evidence of “turning

growth effect of high

Main conclusions
The results suggest an
inverse relationship
between initial debt and
subsequent growth,
controlling for other
determinants of growth:
on average, a 10
percentage point
increase in the initial
debt-to-GDP ratio is
associated with a
slowdown in annual real
per capita GDP growth
of around 0.2
percentage points per
year, with the impact
being smaller (around
0.15) in advanced
economies. There is
some evidence
of nonlinearity, with
only high (above 90
percent of GDP) levels
of debt having a
significant negative
effect on growth.
The estimates support a
hump-shaped nonlinear
relationship between
external debt and
growth. The average
impact of debt on
growth becomes
negative at the 35-40
debt/GDP threshold. For
external debt/exports the
threshold is 160-170
percent.

Main conclusions

The differences in preand post-crises frequency
distributions are
compared for the level of
GDP, growth,
unemployment, inflation,
private debt, and real
estate prices. Advanced
and emerging economy
episodes are examined
both jointly and
individually.

Study concludes that
private deleveraging is a
protracted process that
starts 2-3 years after the
crisis and lasts about
seven years during
which GDP growth is
lower by about one
percent per annum. The
magnitude of the
deleveraging is
comparable to the debt
build up prior to the
crisis.

Years (observations) are
sorted into 4 buckets,
those with debt/GDP 0-30
percent; 30-60; 60-90; and
above 90 percent. Basic
descriptive statistics are
reported for each of the
four buckets for advanced
and emerging economies
separately and for full and
post WWII samples.

Evidence of
nonlinearities is
presented. There is no
systematic link between
public debt and growth
for debt/GDP below 90
percent but the
contemporaneous
relationship is negative
for higher levels of debt.
