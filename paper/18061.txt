Comparative Advantage and the Welfare Impact of European Integration
Andrei A. Levchenko and Jing Zhang
NBER Working Paper No. 18061
May 2012
JEL No. F11,F14,F15
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the welfare gains from European trade integration, and the role of comparative
advantage in determining the magnitude of those gains. We use a multisector Ricardian model implemented
on 79 countries, and compare welfare in the 2000s to a counterfactual scenario in which East European
countries are closed to trade. For West European countries, the mean welfare gain from trade integration
with Eastern Europe is 0.16%, rang- ing from zero for Portugal to 0.4% for Austria. For East European
countries, gains from trade are 9.23% at the mean, ranging from 2.85% for Russia to 20% for Estonia.
For Eastern Europe, comparative advantage is a key determinant of the variation in the welfare gains:
countries whose comparative advantage is most similar to Western Europe tend to gain less, while
countries with technology most different from Western Europe gain the most.

Introduction

The fall of the Iron Curtain 20 years ago led to one of the largest episodes of abrupt trade
integration in postwar history. It brought some 375 million people of the former communist
bloc out of the politically imposed isolation and into the world trading system. Indeed, trade
integration has been rapid. Figure 1(a) plots total inflation-adjusted exports of the East European
countries between 1962 and 2007, expressed as an index number relative to 1990. The nearly 8fold expansion in East European exports between 1990 and 2007 far outpaces the growth of
overall world trade. For geographical, historical, and political reasons, Western Europe is the
region most affected by the integration of ex-communist countries. Figure 1(b) plots the share
of Eastern Europe in total West European imports from the rest of the world. After remaining
stable at about 10% from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, it reached 24% by 2007.
Such episodes of rapid trade integration of large regions are relatively rare, and provide an
important “laboratory” for a quantitative study of the welfare gains from trade. This paper
provides a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the welfare gains from the post-Cold War
European trade integration. The analysis extends the quantitative framework recently developed
by Levchenko and Zhang (2011). We build a multisector Ricardian-Heckscher-Ohlin model that
incorporates a number of realistic features, such as multiple factors of production, an explicit nontraded sector, the full specification of input-output linkages between the sectors, and both interand intra-industry trade. We use the model to estimate sector-level productivities – comparative
advantage – for 19 manufacturing sectors and a sample of 79 countries that includes 17 West
European and 14 East European countries, as well as virtually all important economies in the
rest of the world.
The key advantage of our multi-sector framework is that unlike quantitative assessments based
on one-sector models (e.g. Eaton and Kortum 2002, Alvarez and Lucas 2007, Arkolakis, Costinot
and Rodrı́guez-Clare 2012), we can examine the role of an often neglected determinant of welfare
gains from trade: the Ricardian comparative advantage. Standard theories tell us that while
trade integration should be beneficial to the countries involved, how much countries gain depends
on the nature of comparative advantage. Generally, countries that are very different from each
other will tend to gain more from trade opening than similar countries. Though qualitatively
this idea is well-understood, quantitatively we still do not have a clear understanding of the role
that Ricardian comparative advantage plays in general, and for welfare gains from European
integration in particular.
We first use our sectoral productivity estimates to document that there is indeed a great deal
of variation in relative technology among the different countries in our sample. Correlations of
sectoral productivities range from 0.16 between Russia and the Netherlands, to virtually 1 between

1

Finland and Poland. Among the West European countries, average (GDP-weighted) correlations
in sectoral technology with the Eastern bloc countries as a group range from 0.285 and 0.417
for the Netherlands and Ireland to 0.928 and 0.926 for Switzerland and Finland. Similarly, for
Eastern Europe, average GDP-weighted correlations with Western Europe range from 0.533 and
0.537 for Estonia and Kazakhstan to 0.921 and 0.916 for Poland and Slovenia.
We then quantify the welfare gains from the trade integration of Eastern Europe, by comparing
welfare in each West and East European country to a counterfactual scenario in which Eastern
Europe is closed to trade. For each East European country, this comparison reveals the total gains
from trade relative to autarky. The mean gain for Eastern Europe is 9.23%, ranging from 2.85% for
Russia to 20% for Estonia. Ricardian comparative advantage plays an important role in explaining
the variation in welfare gains in Eastern Europe. Controlling for country size and average trade
costs, East European countries that are similar in relative technology to Western Europe – the
wealthier Central European countries – tend to gain less. The most technologically different
countries – Estonia and Kazakhstan – gain the most. The impact of similarity in comparative
advantage is significant in magnitude: a one-standard deviation change in similarity to Western
Europe increases the welfare gains for an East European country by 2.4%, all else equal.
For Western Europe, the mean gain from East European trade integration is 0.16%, ranging
from zero for Portugal to 0.4% for Austria. Technological similarity to Eastern Europe does not
help account – in the least-squares sense – for the variation in the gains to Western Europe. Trade
costs with the East European countries are the predominant determinant of the variation in gains.
Not surprisingly, West European gains are much smaller, since for each West European country, this comparison represents the gains from the ability to trade with Eastern Europe, given
that it trades with the rest of the world as well. Even at the peak, imports from Eastern Europe
take up only a quarter of total West European imports from outside the region. Probing further,
the main reason for the negligible role of comparative advantage is that the rest of the world has
very similar sectoral productivity to the East European countries as a group. The simple correlation of average sectoral productivities in Eastern Europe with average sectoral productivities in
the other countries serving the West European market – the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, the
Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa – is in excess of 0.9. Thus, from the perspective of Western
Europe, taken as a group Eastern Europe looks much like the rest of the world economy with
which it trades. This is not to say that individual East European countries are not very different
from the rest of the world – they are. But on the whole, Eastern Europe is a collection of diverse
economies that looks quite similar to the world as a whole in terms of comparative advantage.
As a result, when Western Europe opens to trade with the East European countries, its imports
from all other regions decrease somewhat and total West European imports expand by a modest
5%. Opening to trade with Eastern Europe also has a negligible effect on the sectoral structure
2

in the West: value added shares of individual sectors never change by more than a fraction of a
percentage point. This implies that Western Europe’s gains come largely from within-industry
specialization. Thus, part of the reason for small welfare gains in Western Europe is that without
East European trade Western Europe easily substitutes towards other source countries, and its
industrial structure remains largely unchanged.
We place our analysis in a broader context by evaluating the impact of other policy experiments
in the European economy, benchmarking the main results and informing the policy priorities. Our
first exercise compares deeper trade integration within Western Europe and the EU to broader
but shallower trade integration with countries farther afield. For the West European countries
the welfare gains from greater intra-West European integration are on average 16 times larger
than the gains from integration with Eastern Europe.1 In addition, more than two-thirds of the
West European gains from East European trade are due to the EU accession countries. Both
of these results suggest that deeper integration brings much greater welfare gains than shallower
integration with more distant economies.
Next, we compare the welfare benefits of different types of integration. Western Europe gains
far less from the observed productivity growth in Eastern Europe than from trade integration
per se. This suggests that the West derives negligible welfare benefits from technology transfer
to Eastern Europe, and that the majority of those benefits accrue to the East European countries. Finally, we examine the impact of barriers to factor reallocation. Our results reveal an
important role for the cross-sectoral reallocation of labor and capital in Eastern Europe. When
factors of production cannot reallocate across sectors, East European gains from trade integration
are reduced by 14%. Equally important as the impact on aggregate gains, trade opening without
sectoral reallocation can have dramatic distributional effects. The policy implications are twofold.
In order to reap the full gains from trade, opening must be accompanied by policies that promote
smooth functioning of both labor and capital markets. And, since wages and returns to capital
can fall dramatically in some import-competing sectors, it is essential to supplement trade opening with appropriate social safety net programs, especially in cases where trade liberalization is
expected to lead to large cross-sectoral reallocations of resources.
This paper relates to the broad line of research that studies regional economic integration
using quantitative models (see Baldwin and Venables 1995, for a survey). With respect to its
focus on Europe, our analysis is most closely related to Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)
assessments of the welfare impact of East European trade integration (e.g., Baldwin, Francois and
Portes 1997, Brown, Deardorff, Djankov and Stern 1997, Hertel, Brockmeier and Swaminathan
1

Indeed, the welfare gains from the observed fall in trade costs within Western Europe from the 1960s to the
2000s are equivalent to more than half of the total West European gains from trade relative to complete autarky
in the 2000s. Put simply, for a West European country the majority of the total benefits from international trade
come from trading with other West European countries.

3

1997, Baourakis, Lakatos and Xepapadeas 2008), and to the quantitative industry equilibrium
studies of West European integration under imperfect competition (e.g. Smith and Venables 1988,
Ottaviano, Taglioni and di Mauro 2009, Corcos, Del Gatto, Mion and Ottaviano 2011).
Our main contribution to this literature is to focus on a neglected determinant of the gains
from trade: Ricardian comparative advantage. We thus build on the CGE approach by incorporating the multi-sector Eaton and Kortum (2002) structure explicitly into a global general
equilibrium framework. Our results are more complementary to the industry equilibrium investigations of Smith and Venables (1988), Ottaviano et al. (2009), and Corcos et al. (2011).
While we ignore the pro-competitive effects of liberalization on firm scale, markups, and firm
selection, we explicitly model cross-industry Ricardian specialization. Methodologically, our work
builds on recent quantitative welfare assessments of trade integration and technological change
in multi-sector Ricardian models (Shikher 2011, Caliendo and Parro 2010, Costinot, Donaldson
and Komunjer 2011, Hsieh and Ossa 2011, Levchenko and Zhang 2011, di Giovanni, Levchenko
and Zhang 2011). This paper is the first to apply this type of analysis to the trade integration of
Eastern Europe.
Before moving on to the description of the model and the results, we outline some limitations
of our analysis. Though our estimates of capital stocks and productivity are taken from the data,
our counterfactuals ignore any endogenous responses of factor endowments and technology to
trade opening. For instance, our analysis abstracts from endogenous cross-border movements of
capital in response to trade opening, and any resulting impacts on factor prices. Similarly, we do
not model the possibility that trade opening was itself responsible for technology transfer from
West to East, and thus in the absence of trade productivity would be lower in Eastern Europe.2
In addition, because the model has no aggregate uncertainty, it also cannot be used to study the
welfare benefits of improved international risk sharing.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the theoretical framework,
and describes the estimation procedure and the data. Section 3 examines the welfare implications
of East European integration, paying special attention to the role of comparative advantage.
Section 4 performs a number of other policy experiments and discusses the policy implications of
the results. Section 5 concludes.
2

The cross-border impact of technology transfer is quantitatively negligible, as we show in section 4.2. Technology
transfer accompanying trade opening may have a large impact on the country receiving the technology, but not on
its trading partners.

The Environment

The world is comprised of N countries, indexed by n and i. In the numerical implementation
below, there are 17 West European countries, 14 East European countries, and 48 non-European
countries. There are J tradeable sectors, plus one nontradeable sector J + 1. Utility over these
sectors in country n is given by

elasticity of substitution between the tradeable sectors, ωj is the taste parameter for tradeable
sector j, YnJ+1 is the nontradeable-sector composite good, and Ynj is the composite good in
tradeable sector j.
Each sector j aggregates a continuum of varieties q ∈ [0, 1] unique to each sector using a CES

where ε denotes the elasticity of substitution across varieties q, Qjn is the total output of sector
j in country n, and Qjn (q) is the amount of variety q that is used in production in sector j and
country n. Producing one unit of good q in sector j in country n requires

input bundles.

Production uses labor (L), capital (K), and intermediate inputs from other sectors. The cost
of an input bundle is:

where wn is the wage, rn is the return to capital, and pkn is the price of intermediate input from
sector k. The value-added based labor intensity is given by αj , and the share of value added in
total output by βj . Both vary by sector. The shares of inputs from other sectors, γk,j vary by
output industry j as well as input industry k.
Following Eaton and Kortum (2002, henceforth EK), productivity znj (q) for each q ∈ [0, 1] in
each sector j is random, and drawn from the Fréchet distribution with cdf:
j −θ

Fnj (z) = e−Tn z .
In this distribution, the absolute advantage term Tnj varies by both country and sector, with
higher values of Tnj implying higher average productivity draws in sector j in country n. The
5

parameter θ captures dispersion, with larger values of θ implying smaller dispersion in draws.
Following Chor (2010), we adopt a broad interpretation of the sectoral productivity parameter Tnj . Countries differ in a variety of ways, for instance in the quality of contract enforcement
and property rights, financial development, and labor market institutions, among others. Recent
empirical and theoretical literature has shown that all of these are sources of comparative advantage in international trade. Our paper adopts a reduced-form approach, under which institutions,
financial development, and other country characteristics manifest themselves in the productivity parameters Tnj . For instance, countries with worse contracting institutions will have lower
Tnj s in the more institutionally intensive sectors. Chor (2010) provides empirical evidence that
sector-level trade patterns can indeed be modelled this way. We follow this approach by necessity,
since it would be impractical to explicitly incorporate all of these various sources of comparative
advantage into a quantitative framework of this scale.
The production cost of one unit of good q in sector j and country n is thus equal to cjn /znj (q).
Each country can produce each good in each sector, and international trade is subject to iceberg
costs: djni > 1 units of good q produced in sector j in country i must be shipped to country n in
order for one unit to be available for consumption there. The trade costs need not be symmetric
– djni need not equal djin – and will vary by sector. We normalize djnn = 1 ∀ n and j.
All the product and factor markets are perfectly competitive, and thus the price at which
country i supplies tradeable good q in sector j to country n is:
pjni (q)

=

cji
zij (q)

djni .

Buyers of each good q in tradeable sector j in country n will only buy from the cheapest source
country, and thus the price actually paid for this good in country n will be:

Characterization of Equilibrium

The competitive equilibrium of this model world economy consists of a set of prices, allocation
rules, and trade shares such that (i) given the prices, all firms’ inputs satisfy the first-order conditions, and their output is given by the production function; (ii) given the prices, the consumers’
demand satisfies the first-order conditions; (iii) the prices ensure the market clearing conditions
for labor, capital, tradeable goods and nontradeable goods; (iv) trade shares ensure balanced
trade for each country.
The set of prices includes the wage rate wn , the rental rate rn , the sectoral prices {pjn }J+1
j=1 , and
6

the aggregate price Pn in each country n. The allocation rules include the capital and labor allocaj J+1

tion across sectors {Knj , Ljn }J+1

(both final and intermediate goods) for each sector. The trade shares include the expenditure

in country n on goods coming from country i in sector j.

will be higher if in sector j, country n’s trading partners have high productivity (Tij ) or low cost
(cji ). It will also be higher if the trade costs that country n faces in this sector are low. Standard
steps lead to the familiar result that the price of good j in country n is simply

the nontradeable sectors.

The model has two principal uses. The first is to estimate the sector-level technology parameters Tnj for a large set of countries. The technology parameters in the tradeable sectors relative
to a reference country (the U.S.) are estimated using data on sectoral output and bilateral trade.
The procedure relies on fitting a structural gravity equation implied by the model. Intuitively,
if controlling for the typical gravity determinants of trade, a country spends relatively more on
domestically produced goods in a particular sector, it is revealed to have either a high relative
productivity or a low relative unit cost in that sector. The procedure then uses data on factor
and intermediate input prices to net out the role of factor costs, yielding an estimate of relative
productivity. This step also produces estimates of bilateral, sector-level trade costs djni . The next
step is to estimate the technology parameters in the tradeable sectors for the U.S.. This procedure
requires directly measuring TFP at the sectoral level using data on real output and inputs, and
then correcting measured TFP for selection due to trade. Third, we calibrate the nontradeable
technology for all countries using the first-order condition of the model and the relative prices of
nontradeables observed in the data. The detailed procedures for all three steps are described in
Levchenko and Zhang (2011) and reproduced in Appendix A.
The second use of the quantitative model is to perform welfare analysis. Given the estimated
sectoral productivities, factor endowments, trade costs, and model parameters, we solve the system
of equations defining the equilibrium under the baseline values, as well as under counterfactual
scenarios, and compare welfare. The algorithm for solving the model is described in Levchenko
9

and Zhang (2011).

2.3

Data and Calibration

Estimation of sectoral productivity parameters Tnj and trade costs djni requires data on total output by sector, as well as sectoral data on bilateral trade. To maximize coverage of the European
countries as well as data quality, sectoral output data for the 27 European Union countries plus
FYR Macedonia were taken from EUROSTAT. For the other 52 countries in the sample, information on output was obtained from the 2009 UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database. The two
output data sources were merged at the roughly 2-digit ISIC Revision 3 level of disaggregation,
yielding 19 manufacturing sectors. Bilateral trade data were collected from the UN COMTRADE
database, and concorded to the same sectoral classification. Productivity and trade cost estimation in this model requires an assumption on the dispersion parameter θ. We pick the value of
θ = 8.28, which is the preferred estimate of EK, and in addition assume that it does not vary
across sectors.3
In order to implement the model numerically, we must in addition calibrate the following sets
of parameters: (i) preference parameters ωj , ξn , and η; (ii) production function parameters ε, αj ,
βj , γk,j for all sectors j and k; (iii) country factor endowments Ln and Kn .
The share of expenditure on traded goods, ξn in each country is sourced from Yi and Zhang
(2010), who compile this information for 30 developed and developing countries. For countries
unavailable in the Yi and Zhang data, values of ξn are imputed based on fitting a simple linear
relationship to log PPP-adjusted per capita GDP from the Penn World Tables. The fit of this
simple bivariate linear relationship is quite good, with the R2 of 0.55. The taste parameters
for tradeable sectors ωj were estimated by combining the model structure above with data on
final consumption expenditure shares in the U.S. sourced from the U.S. Input-Output matrix,
as described in Appendix A. The elasticity of substitution between broad sectors within the
3

There are no reliable estimates of how θ varies across sectors, and thus we do not model this variation. Shikher
(2004, 2005, 2011), Burstein and Vogel (2009), and Eaton, Kortum, Neiman and Romalis (2010), among others,
follow the same approach of assuming the same θ across sectors. Caliendo and Parro (2010) use tariff data and
triple differencing to estimate sector-level θ. However, their approach may impose too much structure and/or
be dominated by measurement error: at times the values of θ they estimate are negative. In addition, in each
sector the restriction that θ > ε − 1 must be satisfied, and it is not clear whether Caliendo and Parro (2010)’s
estimated sectoral θ’s meet this restriction in every case. Our approach is thus conservative by being agnostic on
this variation across sectors. It is also important to assess how the results below are affected by the value of this
parameter. One may be especially concerned about how the results change under lower values of θ. Lower θ implies
greater within-sector heterogeneity in the random productivity draws. Thus, trade flows become less sensitive to
the costs of the input bundles (cji ), and the gains from intra-sectoral trade become larger relative to the gains from
inter-sectoral trade. In Levchenko and Zhang (2011), we estimated the sectoral productivities for a sample of 75
countries assuming instead a value of θ = 4, which has been advocated by Simonovska and Waugh (2010) and
is at or near the bottom of the range that has been used in the literature. Overall, the results are remarkably
similar. The correlation between estimated Tij ’s under θ = 4 and under θ = 8.28 is above 0.95, and there is actually
somewhat greater variability in Tij ’s under θ = 4.

tradeable bundle, η, is set to 2. Since these are very large product categories, it is sensible that
this elasticity would be relatively low. It is higher, however, than the elasticity of substitution
between tradeable and nontradeable goods, which is set to 1 by the Cobb-Douglas assumption.
The production function parameters αj and βj are estimated using the output, value added,
and wage bill data from EUROSTAT and UNIDO. To compute αj for each sector, we calculate
the share of the total wage bill in value added, and take a simple median across countries (taking
the mean yields essentially the same results). To compute βj , compute the ratio of value added
to total output for each country and sector, and take the median across countries.
The intermediate input coefficients γk,j are obtained from the Direct Requirements Table
for the United States. We use the 1997 Benchmark Detailed Make and Use Tables (covering
approximately 500 distinct sectors), as well as a concordance to the ISIC Revision 3 classification
to build a Direct Requirements Table at the 2-digit ISIC level. The Direct Requirements Table
gives the value of the intermediate input in row k required to produce one dollar of final output
in column j. Thus, it is the direct counterpart of the input coefficients γk,j . Note that we assume
these to be the same in all countries.4 In addition, we use the U.S. I-O matrix to obtain αJ+1
and βJ+1 in the nontradeable sector.5 The elasticity of substitution between varieties within each
tradeable sector, ε, is set to 4.
The total labor force in each country, Ln , and the total capital stock, Kn , are computed based
on the Penn World Tables 6.3. Following the standard approach in the literature (see, e.g. Hall and
Jones 1999, Bernanke and Gürkaynak 2001, Caselli 2005), the total labor force is calculated from
data on the total GDP per capita and per worker.6 The total capital stock is calculated using the
perpetual inventory method that assumes a depreciation rate of 6%: Kn,t = (1−0.06)Kn,t−1 +In,t ,
where In,t is total investment in country n in period t. For most countries, investment data start
in 1950, and the initial value of Kn is set equal to In,0 /(γ + 0.06), where γ is the average growth
rate of investment in the first 10 years for which data are available.
All of the variables that vary over time are averaged for the period 2000-2007 (the latest
available year), which is the time period on which we carry out the analysis. Appendix Table A1
lists the countries used in the analysis, separating them into Western Europe, Eastern Europe,
and the rest of the world.7 Appendix Table A2 lists the sectors along with the key parameter

di Giovanni and Levchenko (2010) provide suggestive evidence that at such a coarse level of aggregation, InputOutput matrices are indeed similar across countries. To check robustness of the results, Levchenko and Zhang (2011)
collected country-specific I-O matrices from the GTAP database. Productivities computed based on country-specific
I-O matrices were very similar to the baseline values, with the median correlation of 0.98, and all but 3 out of 75
countries with a correlation of 0.93 or above, and the minimum correlation of 0.65.
5
The U.S. I-O matrix provides an alternative way of computing αj and βj . These parameters calculated based
on the U.S. I-O table are very similar to those obtained from UNIDO, with the correlation coefficients between
them above 0.85 in each case. The U.S. I-O table implies greater variability in αj ’s and βj ’s across sectors than
does UNIDO.

Using the variable name conventions in the Penn World Tables, Ln = 1000 ∗ pop ∗ rgdpch/rgdpwok.

Due to lack of required data, a number of East European countries are missing. The missing countries include all

values for each sector: αj , βj , the share of nontradeable inputs in total inputs γJ+1,j , and the
taste parameter ωj .

The Welfare Impact of European Integration

3.1

Basic Patterns

Table 1 reports the matrix of correlations of Tnj in the tradeable sectors j = 1, ..., J between
all pairs of East and West European countries. In order to focus on differences in comparative
rather than absolute advantage, we compute the correlations on the vectors of Tnj demeaned
by each country’s geometric average Tnj . It is clear that the differences in sectoral similarities
between country pairs are pronounced. In Eastern Europe, countries most similar to the West are
Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia, while Estonia and Kazakhstan are most different from the West.
Among the West European countries, Finland and Switzerland have the most similar comparative
advantage to Eastern Europe, while the Netherlands and Ireland are the most different. Figure
2 presents these correlations graphically, using a contour plot with darker shades representing
higher correlations. We next explore the impact of such pronounced differences in technological
similarity on the magnitude of the welfare gains from European integration.

3.2

Model Fit

Our model matches quite closely the relative incomes of countries as well as bilateral and overall
trade flows observed in the data. Table 2 compares the wages, returns to capital, and the trade
shares in the baseline model solution and in the data. The top panel shows that mean and median
wages implied by the model are very close to the data. The correlation coefficient between modelimplied wages and those in the data is above 0.99. The second panel performs the same comparison
for the return to capital. Since it is difficult to observe the return to capital in the data, we follow
the approach adopted in the estimation of Tnj ’s, and impute rn from an aggregate factor market
clearing condition: rn /wn = (1 − α) Ln / (αKn ), where α is the aggregate share of labor in GDP,
assumed to be 2/3. Once again, the average levels of rn are very similar in the model and the
data, and the correlation between the two is 0.95.
Next, we compare the trade shares implied by the model to those in the data. The third panel
j
of Table 2 reports the spending on domestically produced goods as a share of overall spending, πnn
.

These values reflect the overall trade openness, with lower values implying higher international

trade as a share of absorption. Though we under-predict overall trade slightly (model πnn

but two of the countries comprising former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia),
the trans-Caucasus countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia), Albania, Belarus, and Moldova. These countries
together account for 14% of total Eastern bloc population and 10% of its GDP, but less than 6% of its exports.

to be higher), the averages are quite similar, and the correlation between the model and data
values is 0.92. Finally, the bottom panel compares the international trade flows in the model and
the data. The averages are very close, and the correlation between the model and data values is
0.91.
Figure 3 presents the comparison of trade flows graphically, by depicting the model-implied
j
trade values against the data, along with a 45-degree line. Red/solid dots indicate πni
’s that

involve Eastern Europe, that is, trade flows in which an East European country is either an
exporter or an importer. All in all the fit of the model to trade flows is quite good. Eastern
Europe is unexceptional when it comes to the fit of the model, with East European trade flows
clustered together with the rest of the observations.

3.3

Welfare Analysis

This section evaluates the welfare gains from trade integration of Eastern Europe. To do so,
we first compute welfare in the baseline model under the actual trade costs djni estimated on
data for the 2000s. We next compute the welfare in a counterfactual scenario in which all East
European countries are in autarky.8 Table 3 reports, for each West and East European country,
the percentage welfare gain from European integration (that is, the proportional difference in
welfare between the benchmark model for 2000s and the counterfactual model in which all East
European countries are in autarky).
All throughout, welfare is defined as the indirect utility function. Straightforward steps using
the CES functional form can be used to show that indirect utility in each country n is equal to
total income divided by the price level. Since the model is competitive, total income equals the
total returns to factors of production. Expressed in per capita terms welfare is thus:
wn + rn kn
,
Pn
where kn = Kn /Ln is capital per worker, and the consumption price level Pn comes from equation
(3).
The gains to Western Europe are not large: the mean welfare increase is 0.16%, and the range
is between essentially zero for Portugal and 0.4% for Austria. This result is not surprising. First,
in the 2000s imports from Eastern Europe are only about 22% of overall West European imports
from outside Western Europe, and only 8% of total West European imports (including from within
8
In the counterfactual, each individual East European country is in autarky, that is, it does not trade with other
Eastern bloc countries. Assuming complete autarky in this counterfactual may over-estimate the gains, since there
was some trade among the Eastern bloc countries, as well as between those countries and the rest of the world.
Our model is not suited to evaluate the welfare gains from trade among the communist bloc countries, since those
were command economies in which all international exchange was centrally planned rather than driven by market
forces.

13

the region). In addition, our counterfactual takes into account the fact that in the absence of
Eastern Europe, the total West European imports would not fall by 8%: Western Europe will
increase imports from all other regions to partially substitute for East European imports. In fact,
as we discuss in detail in Section 3.4, in the complete absence of Eastern Europe, total West
European imports would only fall by 4.7%.
For Eastern Europe, gains are much greater, since in this case we are comparing complete
autarky to trade. The median change in welfare is 9.23%, ranging from 2.85% for Russia to
nearly 20% for Estonia. Not surprisingly, larger and farther away countries (Russia, Ukraine)
tend to gain much less than smaller ones, such as the Baltic countries, FYR Macedonia, and
Bulgaria. Note that the gains are from trade with all of the world, not just with Western Europe.
How much does comparative advantage affect the magnitude of these gains? To account for
the variation in the gains from East European trade, we regress the total welfare change on the
average djni , the correlation between the T ’s, as well as total GDP to control for the well-known
role of country size. Note that we do not seek any kind of causal interpretation of these regressions.
Rather, we only want to see which variables correlate with the variation in the welfare gains, and
can “explain” it in the least-squares sense. Table 4 reports the results, for three ways of weighting
djni ’s and correlations of T ’s: equal-weighted, GDP-weighted, and population-weighted. That is,
when the regression is carried out on the sample of West European countries, we compute, for each
country, the (weighted) average of its trade cost to each East European country, and the (weighted)
average of its technological similarity to each East European country. When the regression is run
on the sample of East European countries, these averages are computed across West European
countries. All the left-hand side variables and the regressors are in logs throughout.9
Panel A reports the results for the 17 West European countries. The R2 ’s of these regressions
are between 0.65 and 0.7, indicating that the three regressors account for the bulk of the crosscountry variation in welfare gains. Trade costs and country size are significant at the 1% level in
all specifications. By contrast, sectoral similarity has the “right” sign but the coefficient is close
to zero and insignificant.
Panel B reports the results for the 14 East European countries. The same three variables do a
better job in absorbing the variation in the welfare gains for Eastern Europe: the R2 ’s are above
0.88 in all three specifications. Here, by contrast, technological similarity to Western Europe
matters a great deal. Even in such a small sample, the coefficients on similarity are significant at
the 1% level, with robust t-statistics of about 3.5. The coefficients are also large in magnitude. A
one-standard deviation change in GDP-weighted technological similarity increases welfare gains
from trade integration by 2.43 percentage points. On the other hand, trade costs don’t seem to
9

None of the average correlations or welfare gains are negative, so taking logs does not lead to dropped observations. Estimating these relationships in levels delivers similar results.

14

matter much in accounting for the gains from trade in Eastern Europe, in spite of the fact that
the variation in trade costs is very similar in the West and East European samples.
Figure 4 presents the contrast between Western and Eastern Europe graphically. It plots
the partial correlations between the welfare gain from East European integration and the GDPweighted technological similarity (left side), and the GDP-weighted djni (right side), after netting
out the other variables in Table 4. The top panel reports the results for Western Europe, the
bottom panel for Eastern Europe. As shown by the regression estimates, for Western Europe
trade costs explain the variation in welfare gains remarkably well, while there is virtually no
relationship with technological similarity. For Eastern Europe, trade costs don’t do as well, but
there is a pronounced negative relationship between similarity and the welfare gains.
This difference in outcomes between Western and Eastern Europe is due to the difference in
relative importance of the two groups in each other’s total trade. Seventy two percent of Eastern
Europe’s imports come from Western Europe in the period we consider. Thus, technological
similarity with Western Europe is an important determinant of the gains from trade relative to
autarky. However, East European countries remain relatively small trade partners for Western
Europe, accounting for about 22% of its imports from the rest of the world on average in the 2000s.
Thus, for Western Europe, East European trade and technological similarity has to be evaluated
in the context of its broader international trade relationships. That is, for Western Europe what
should matter is not so much its similarity to Eastern Europe per se, but the relative similarity
of Eastern Europe to the average country with which Western Europe already trades (see di
Giovanni et al. 2011, for a closely related result).
To that end, we compute the average productivity of East European countries in a sector, and
correlate it to the average productivity of all the other trade partners of Western Europe (the
Americas, Asia, the Pacific, Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa). It turns out
that from the perspective of Western Europe, Eastern Europe looks very much like the rest of the
world with which it trades. The correlation between the average sectoral productivity in Eastern
Europe and in the rest of the world is a remarkable 0.91. Figure 5 presents this result graphically,
with average productivities expressed as a fraction of the world frontier. (This regularity holds for
population- and GDP-weighted averages as well.) Of course, individual East European countries
often have a comparative advantage that is very different from the rest of the world. But Eastern
Europe contains many diverse countries, and as a group they look much like the rest of the world
economy in terms of their relative technology.
Thus, the gains to Western Europe from East European trade come not primarily from trading
with technologically different countries, but from the expansion of markets. As a result, trade costs
explain very well the variation in the gains from trade for Western Europe, while technological
similarity to Eastern Europe does not matter much.
15

3.4

Global Trade Volumes

We next explore how East European integration changes the pattern of global trade. By construction, when Eastern Europe opens to trade, exports from Eastern Europe to all other countries
rise. But what happens to exports from other regions, in particular to Western Europe? As
Eastern Europe takes up a substantial share of West European imports, do imports to Western
Europe from other regions fall, and if yes, by how much?
Before describing the comparison between the counterfactual and the benchmark, we check
how well the model reproduces the cross-regional trade shares. To do so, we compute, in both the
data and the benchmark model, the shares of total extra-regional imports going to each region.
That is, we take the total imports from the rest of the world to, say, Western Europe, and compute
the share of those imports captured by Eastern Europe, as well as every other region. The regions
we consider are non-Europe OECD countries (which for us are the United States, Canada, Japan,
Australia, and New Zealand); Latin America and the Caribbean; Middle East and North Africa;
East and South Asia; and Sub-Saharan Africa. Figure 6 presents the scatterplot of those shares
in the data (on the x-axis) against the model, along with a 45-degree line. All in all, the model
matches the cross-regional import shares remarkably well. The correlation between model and
data shares is 0.98, and the Spearman rank correlation is 0.98 as well.
Next, Table 5 presents the matrix of percentage changes in cross-regional trade volumes from
the counterfactual to the benchmark. The table omits Eastern Europe from both the rows and
the columns of the table because in the counterfactual Eastern Europe is in autarky, and thus
percentage changes between the counterfactual and the benchmark are infinity. Of particular
interest is the top row, that shows imports into Western Europe. As Eastern Europe opens
to trade, imports from all other regions fall, by between −1.45% from non-Europe OECD and
−4.09% from the Middle East/North Africa region. As a result, total West European imports –
inclusive of Eastern Europe – increase by only 4.7%. This modest change is an illustration of why
the gains to Western Europe from the opening up of Eastern Europe are so modest: if Eastern
Europe weren’t there, the Western countries would substitute imports from other world regions
for East European imports. The pattern looks similar elsewhere in the world. Total imports
rise, but by less than in Western Europe. Imports from regions other than Eastern Europe fall
modestly.

3.5

Changes in Sectoral Structure

A closely related question is what happens to industrial structure in Western Europe as a result of
European integration. In this subsection, we compare sectoral structure implied by the baseline
model to the counterfactual sectoral structure that would have prevailed had Eastern Europe not

16

been integrated.
Figure 7(a) presents the absolute changes in shares of value added in each sector and each
country as Eastern Europe opens to trade. The most striking result is just how little change
in sectoral structure takes place. Aside from the non-tradeable sector, in which shares usually
decrease and sometimes by as much as 0.0025 (or a quarter of a percentage point), one hardly
observes changes in value added shares in excess of 0.0005, or 0.05 percentage points. By and large,
industrial structure remains the same as Western Europe opens to trade with Eastern Europe.
This lack of effect is in part because, as mentioned above, Eastern Europe represents only 22%
of all West European imports from outside the region, and in part because Eastern Europe has
similar technology to the rest of Western Europe’s trading partners. Thus, trade liberalization of
Eastern Europe does not represent a significant change in West European comparative advantage
vis-à-vis the rest of the world with which it trades.
This lack of change in Western sectoral structure is in sharp contrast with Eastern Europe,
depicted in Figure 7(b). Note the difference in scale of the y-axis: while for Western Europe,
changes in the tradeable sector range from −0.0005 to 0.0015, with the non-tradeable share
falling by less than 0.0025 in all cases, for Eastern Europe the changes in tradeable sector shares
range from about −0.005 to 0.02, and as much as −0.05 in the non-tradeable sector. This is a
difference in sectoral share changes of an order of magnitude. Not surprisingly, welfare changes
in Eastern Europe are much greater.

4

Benchmarking the Gains and Policy Implications

Are the gains from East European integration produced by our model large or small? Comparing
the main welfare results to alternative policy experiments will shed light on where integration
of Eastern Europe falls in the ranking of different changes that occurred, or might occur, in
the European economy. These differences in impact will then inform the policy priorities, by
highlighting economic changes that have relatively large or small welfare payoffs. This section
develops a number of alternative counterfactuals, with an eye on comparing the welfare impact
of these alternative changes to the welfare impact of the integration of Eastern Europe.

4.1

West European Integration

The obvious comparison for East European integration is the earlier integration within Western
Europe. Unlike the fall of the Iron Curtain that brought about an abrupt integration of Eastern
Europe, West European integration has been a much more gradual and continuous process. Starting with the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community among the original 6
members that went into effect in 1952, integration both broadened by expanding the EU to 15
17

West European members, and deepened over time. The major treaties are the Treaty of Rome
(went into effect 1958), Single European Act (1987), the Treaty on European Union (also known
as the Maastricht Treaty, 1993), and up to the Treaty of Lisbon (signed 2007). In between these
major milestones, there were more minor treaties as well. Thus, the basic difficulty in simulating
the welfare impact of West European integration is that there is no single year, or even decade,
during which integration occurred.
To take the broadest view of this process, we simulate a counterfactual scenario in which
trade costs djni between West European trade partners are rolled back to their 1960s values. Our
estimates for the 1960s show that trade costs within Western Europe are 45% higher in the 1960s
compared to today, and this is the change in trade costs that we simulate. This exercise in effect
attributes all of the fall in iceberg trade costs within Western Europe from the 1960s to the 2000s
to policy measures relating to West European integration, and thus may over-estimate the total
impact of policy measures. On the other hand, a great deal of policy barriers to cross-border trade
in particular were dismantled prior to 1962 (the earliest year in our data) among the original 6
members. The fact that we start in the 1960s may thus under-estimate the total sweep of the
EU’s impact. A fall in trade costs of this magnitude appears to be in a reasonable ballpark for
assessing the impact of deep economic integration on trade flows.
The first column of Table 6 presents the results. Precisely, we report the change in West
European welfare due to a reduction in intra-West-European trade costs by 45%, the end point of
this reduction being today’s trade costs. This counterfactual assumes that Eastern Europe stays
in autarky throughout, in order to mimic, albeit in a very rough way, historical developments.
Western Europe was well on its way towards deep integration within the region when Eastern
Europe was integrated. The mean welfare gains to Western Europe from observed within-region
integration are 2.53%. These gains are on average 16 times larger than the gains from opening to
Eastern Europe. This finding is not surprising, since West European trade partners are far more
important for a typical West European country than East European partners.
To probe further, column 2 of Table 6 presents the West European countries’ gains from trade
relative to complete autarky.10 The model implies that the mean gains from trade in Western
Europe are 4.54%. Strikingly, just a 45% reduction in trade costs with only fellow West European
countries accounts for more than half of the total gains from trade for Western Europe. These
results speak to the policy tradeoff between the benefits of continued “deep” integration within
Western Europe, and the “shallow” but broad integration with other regions, such as Eastern
Europe and beyond. West European economies are relatively large, productive, and close to
each other. Thus, quantitatively the gains from reductions in trade barriers within that group of
10

In this calculation, gains are computed with respect to the baseline scenario, that is, each West European
country goes from trading with no one to trading with everyone including Eastern Europe.

18

countries are an order of magnitude larger than even the gains from integration of large economic
blocs such as Eastern Europe, China, or India.11 These results point to a potentially much greater
benefit of deeper, rather than broader, integration.
The gains from trade relative to autarky in Western Europe can also be compared to the
gains for Eastern Europe in Table 3. East European gains from trade are two times larger than
Western Europe’s gains. Not surprisingly, since East European countries tend to be both smaller
in size and less productive, they derive greater benefits from international exchange. From a
policy perspective, this suggests that further trade integration in Eastern Europe, especially with
its West European neighbors, is likely to have an even larger welfare impact than reductions in
West European trade barriers. Thus, policies that improve the links between the two groups of
countries, such as investment in infrastructure, are likely to have a larger payoff in Eastern Europe
compared to the West.

4.2

East European Integration and Productivity Growth

Another facet of the tradeoff between deeper and broader integration relates to the differing
degrees of integration of East European countries with the West. Does Western Europe gain
more from deeper integration with the Central European countries currently in the European
Union, or from a more arms-length trade relationship with non-EU countries? The answer is not
clear ex ante: non-EU countries such as Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan are both larger in size,
and more technologically different, than the EU-25 countries of Central Europe. Columns 3 and
4 of Table 6 report the gains from integration of EU-member East European countries, and the
gains from integration of non-EU East European countries respectively. Of the total mean gains
from East European integration, 0.156%, two-thirds (0.107%) are due to integration of the EU
East European countries. The remaining one-third (0.049%) is due to non-EU Eastern Europe.12
Once again, these results are suggestive that economic policies should aim at deeper integration
of current EU member countries, rather than broader integration of countries farther afield.
The previous exercises compare our main results to the impact of other types of reductions in
trade costs, whether within Western Europe, or for different sets of East European countries. Next,
we benchmark the results against another drastic change that took place in the East European
economy, namely economic growth. Has Western Europe benefited more from a fall in trade
costs with Eastern Europe per se, or from the dramatic productivity growth (and the somewhat
11

Elsewhere (di Giovanni et al. 2011) we computed the worldwide gains from the trade integration of China. For
West European countries, the mean gains from trade with China are 0.09%, with the maximum gain of 0.162%.
12
The EU East European countries are Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak
Republic, and Slovenia. All of these joined the EU in 2004, in the middle of our sample of years. Bulgaria and
Romania joined in 2007, the last year of our sample, and thus we put them in the non-EU group. Adding them
to the EU group will make the difference between the welfare impact of EU and non-EU integration even more
pronounced.

19

less dramatic capital accumulation) that took place in Eastern Europe since the fall of the Iron
Curtain? To answer this question, we simulate the welfare benefit to Western Europe from
the productivity growth and capital accumulation that actually occurred in the East European
countries from the 1990s to the 2000s. Over this period, these economies grew dramatically, with
productivity rising 33% over a decade (2.9% growth per annum).13 Note that, as is well known in
the trade literature, a trading partner’s productivity growth need not improve a country’s welfare
(see, e.g. Hicks 1953, Samuelson 2004). In addition, quantitative assessments in other contexts
have found that the overwhelming majority of welfare benefits from productivity growth accrue to
the growing country itself rather than to other countries through trade (Hsieh and Ossa 2011, di
Giovanni et al. 2011).
Column 5 of Table 6 reports the welfare gains to Western Europe from the observed growth in
Eastern Europe from the 1990s to the 2000s. These gains are virtually nil: 0.028% (i.e. 0.00028),
with a maximum of 0.067%. Thus, it appears that the modest welfare gains to Western Europe
from trade integration with the East are still larger than the gains from productivity growth in
those countries, even though that productivity growth has been dramatic. This finding suggests
that policies favoring eastward technology transfer and foreign direct investment do not have a
large aggregate welfare payoff for the West, even relative to reductions in trade costs with East
European countries. Of course, those policies will have a much greater positive welfare impact on
the East European countries themselves.

4.3

Importance of Factor Reallocation

The preceding counterfactuals assumed that the factors of production reallocate optimally in
response to each change in trade costs, and thus labor and capital markets clear within each
country. A frequently expressed concern with greater integration – be it with Eastern Europe or
other regions – is that reallocation of production factors within a country is difficult. Barriers to
factor reallocation will both reduce the magnitude of the gains from trade, and create winners and
losers even when aggregate gains are positive. To the extent that factor reallocation is required
for reaping the benefits of trade, policies that impede that reallocation, such as rigid labor market
institutions, may also reduce the gains from trade.
To assess the importance of factor reallocation quantitatively, we compute the welfare gains
from East European integration under the assumption that capital and labor in each sector are
fixed. That is, when Eastern Europe opens to trade, factors cannot move from one sector to
13
To be precise, we compare welfare in Western Europe under the 2000s baseline to a counterfactual scenario in
which Eastern Europe’s trade costs are the same as in the baseline, but East European productivities and capitallabor ratios are as they were in the 1990s. Thus, the counterfactual scenario is a world in which trade integration
with Eastern Europe took place, but there was no growth in those countries from the 1990s to today.

20

another in response.14 Table 7 reports the welfare changes in that experiment. As expected,
the welfare gains from East European integration are smaller for every country if factors are not
mobile across sectors. For Western Europe, the difference is not large in absolute terms: the
mean gains are 0.142% instead of 0.156% in the main analysis. For Eastern Europe, however, the
welfare gains without sectoral reallocation are significantly smaller in both absolute and relative
terms. The mean gain from trade drops to 7.94%, which is 14% less than the 9.23% welfare gain
when factors are mobile. The pronounced difference between the two groups of countries in the
impact of factor reallocation on welfare gains is not surprising in light of the results in section
3.5. As Figure 7 makes clear, East European integration induced only small changes in sectoral
structure in Western Europe, whereas in Eastern Europe sectoral composition changed much more
dramatically. From a policy perspective, we conclude that efforts to promote smooth functioning
of the labor and capital markets are especially important in trade liberalization episodes that are
expected to produce large cross-sectoral reallocations.
A distinct but related question is how large are the distributional consequences of trade opening. Understanding the magnitudes of the distributional effects is important in designing the social
safety net programs to cushion the negative consequences of trade opening for import-competing
sectors. To address this question exhaustively, one would require a model with explicit frictions
in the mobility of factors across sectors. The exercise here represents an extreme case in which
factors are not allowed to move at all between sectors. In addition, we do not take an explicit
stand on who owns the capital in each sector, and thus we can only compute changes in wages
and returns to capital in each sector, rather than in individuals’ overall incomes. Nonetheless,
analyzing the factor price changes can give us a rough sense of the distributional impact of trade
opening when factors are immobile across sectors.
Figure 8 presents, for each sector, the distribution of percentage changes in sector-specific real
wage (top panel) and real return to capital (bottom panel) when Eastern Europe opens to trade.
The solid dots represent Western Europe, and hollow dots Eastern Europe. Two conclusions
emerge. First, the variation in real factor returns across sectors dwarfs the magnitude of the
aggregate impact. For Western Europe, as we saw above the mean welfare change is 0.142%. By
contrast, the changes in real wage and the real return to capital range across sectors from about
−1% to 1% in every country, and as much as from −5% to 5% in smaller countries such as Iceland
and Ireland. Second, the cross-sectoral dispersion in wage and return to capital changes is far
larger in Eastern Europe. It is not uncommon to observe 50% reductions, or 100% increases in
the real returns to factors in individual industries.
These results further inform policy priorities. The finding that the distributional impacts

the primary importance of social safety net programs. In Western Europe, the absolute welfare
changes even in the most import-competing sectors are small, rarely more than 1%. Thus, East
European integration is unlikely to have led to a large amount of dislocation in the West. By
contrast, East European workers and capital owners in particular sectors can experience very
large swings (from halving to doubling of real wages or capital returns). Thus, social safety nets
are especially needed in those countries as they open to trade. Finally, we stress that smooth and
efficient factor markets will limit the within-country divergence in factor prices across sectors due
to trade liberalization, and thus lead to less reliance on the social safety net.

Conclusion

Ever since the original formulation of the Ricardian model in the nineteenth century, it has
been understood that the magnitude of the relative differences in technology – “the strength of
comparative advantage” – matters for the size of the gains from trade. Broadly speaking, stronger
comparative advantage leads to larger gains from trade. However, the importance of this effect
has not been assessed quantitatively.
This paper uses the trade integration of Eastern Europe after the fall of the Iron Curtain as a
laboratory for evaluating the role of comparative advantage in the gains from trade. We estimate
sector-level productivities for 19 sectors in 79 countries, and document that differences in relative
technology do indeed vary a great deal among the Western and East European country pairs.
Using a multi-sector, multi-factor quantitative model of trade and these sectoral productivity
estimates, we evaluate the gains from European integration for each country.
The variation in gains to West European countries is mainly accounted for by trade costs, with
technological similarity playing little or no role. By contrast, the dispersion in gains to Eastern
Europe is well explained by technological similarity to Western Europe. This difference is due to
the asymmetry in the relative importance of the two country groups as trade partners. The large
majority of East European trade is with Western Europe. For Western Europe, however, Eastern
Europe is still a minor trade partner. Furthermore, a comparison of sectoral productivities reveals
that as a group, Eastern Europe has a similar comparative advantage as the rest of Western
Europe’s trade partners. Thus, the gains to Western Europe come mainly from expansion of
markets, rather than from technological differences with Eastern Europe.
Placing the East European trade opening episode within a broader context of West European
integration allows us to draw out a number of policy implications. Deeper within-Europe integration appears to confer greater welfare benefits than shallower but broader trade integration.
Technology transfer from Western to Eastern Europe will benefit East European countries, but
have virtually no positive welfare impact on the West. Eastern Europe has likely experienced

22

large distributional effects due to trade opening. Thus, it is imperative that trade integration is
accompanied by policies that promote optimal reallocation of factors of production, and ensure a
minimum safety net for those displaced by import competition.

Appendix A

Procedure for Estimating Tnj , djni , and ωj

This appendix reproduces from Levchenko and Zhang (2011) the details of the procedure for estimating technology, trade costs, and taste parameters required to implement the model. Interested
readers should consult that paper for further details on estimation steps and data sources.

A.1

Tradeable Sector Relative Technology

We now focus on the tradeable sectors. Following the standard EK approach, first divide trade
shares by their domestic counterpart:
j
πni
j
πnn

=

j
Xni
j
Xnn


−θ
Tij cji djni
=

which in logs becomes:
ln

j
Xni

!

j
Xnn





= ln Tij (cji )−θ − ln Tnj (cjn )−θ − θ ln djni .

Let the (log) iceberg costs be given by the following expression:
j
j
+ RT Ajni + exji + νni
,
ln djni = djk + bjni + CUni

where djk is an indicator variable for a distance interval. Following EK, we set the distance
intervals, in miles, to [0, 350], [350, 750], [750, 1500], [1500, 3000], [3000, 6000], [6000, maximum).
Additional variables are whether the two countries share a common border (bjni ), belong to a
j
currency union (CUni
), or to a regional trade agreement (RT Ajni ). Following the arguments in
j
Waugh (2010), we include an exporter fixed effect exji . Finally, there is an error term νni
. Note

that all the variables have a sector superscript j: we allow all the trade cost proxy variables to
affect true iceberg trade costs djni differentially across sectors. There is a range of evidence that
trade volumes at sector level vary in their sensitivity to distance or common border (see, among
many others, Do and Levchenko 2007, Berthelon and Freund 2008).
This leads to the following final estimating equation:

Error Term

This equation is estimated for each tradeable sector j = 1, ...J. Estimating this relationship
will thus yield, for each country, an estimate of its technology-cum-unit-cost term in each sector j,
Tnj (cjn )−θ , which is obtained by exponentiating the importer fixed effect. The available degrees of
freedom imply that these estimates are of each country’s Tnj (cjn )−θ relative to a reference country,
which in our estimation is the United States. We denote this estimated value by Snj :
Snj

=

!−θ

Tnj

cjn

j
Tus

cjus

,

where the subscript us denotes the United States. It is immediate from this expression that
estimation delivers a convolution of technology parameters Tnj and cost parameters cjn . Both will
of course affect trade volumes, but we would like to extract technology Tnj from these estimates.
In order to do that, we follow the approach of Shikher (2004). In particular, for each country n,
the share of total spending going to home-produced goods is given by
j
Xnn

Xnj

=

Tnj

Γcjn

!−θ
.

pjn

Dividing by its U.S. counterpart yields:
j
Xnn
/Xnj
j
j
/Xus
Xus,us

=

Tnj

cjn pjus

j
Tus

cjus pjn

!−θ
= Snj

pjus

!−θ
,

pjn

and thus the ratio of price levels in sector j relative to the U.S. becomes:
pjn
pjus

=

j
/Xnj
Xnn

1

j
j
Xus,us
/Xus
Snj

!1
θ

.

(A.1)

The entire right-hand side of this expression is either observable or estimated. Thus, we can
impute the price levels relative to the U.S. in each country and each tradeable sector.
The cost of the input bundles relative to the U.S. can be written as:
cjn
cjus


=

wn
wus

αj βj 

rn

(1−αj )βj

Y
p

k=1

pkus

n

pJ+1
us

.

Using information on relative wages, returns to capital, price in each tradeable sector from (A.1),
and the nontradeable sector price relative to the U.S., we can thus impute the costs of the input
bundles relative to the U.S. in each country and each sector. Armed with those values, it is

25

straightforward to back out the relative technology parameters:
Tnj
j
Tus

A.2

=

Snj

cjn
cjus

!θ
.

Trade Costs

The bilateral, directional, sector-level trade costs of shipping from country i to country n in sector
j are then computed based on the estimated coefficients as:
j
j
d j + θRT
[
ln dˆjni = θdˆjk + θb̂jni + θCU
Ani + θc
exji + θb
νni
,
ni

for an assumed value of θ. Note that the estimate of the trade costs includes the residual from the
j
gravity regression θb
νni
. Thus, the trade costs computed as above will fit bilateral sectoral trade

flows exactly, given the estimated fixed effects. Note also that the exporter component of the
trade costs ec
xji is part of the exporter fixed effect. Since each country in the sample appears as
both an exporter and an importer, the exporter and importer estimated fixed effects are combined
to extract an estimate of θc
exji .

A.3

Complete Estimation

So far we have estimated the levels of technology of the tradeable sectors relative to the United
States. To complete our estimation, we still need to find (i) the levels of T for the tradeable
sectors in the United States; (ii) the taste parameters ωj , and (iii) the nontradeable technology
levels for all countries.
To obtain (i), we use the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database for the U.S. (Bartelsman
and Gray 1996). We start by measuring the observed TFP levels for the tradeable sectors in the
U.S.. The form of the production function gives
j
j
ln Zus
= ln Λjus + βj αj ln Ljus + βj (1 − αj ) ln Kus
+ (1 − βj )

J+1
X

k,j
γk,j ln Mus
,

(A.2)

k=1

where Λj denotes the measured TFP in sector j, Z j denotes the output, Lj denotes the labor
input, K j denotes the capital input, and M k,j denotes the intermediate input from sector k. The
NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database offers information on output, and inputs of labor,
capital, and intermediates, along with deflators for each. Thus, we can estimate the observed
TFP level for each manufacturing tradeable sector using the above equation.
If the United States were a closed economy, the observed TFP level for sector j would be given
1

j
by Λjus = (Tus
) θ . In the open economies, the goods with inefficient domestic productivity draws

26

will not be produced and will be imported instead. Thus, international trade and competition
introduce selection in the observed TFP level, as demonstrated by Finicelli, Pagano and Sbracia
j
(2009a). We thus use the model to back out the true level of Tus
of each tradeable sector in the

United States. Here we follow Finicelli et al. (2009a) and use the following relationship:
(Λjus )θ

=

j
Tus

X

cji djus,i

i6=us

Thus, we have

j
This equation can be solved for underlying technology parameters Tus
in the U.S., given estimated

observed TFP Λjus , and all the Sij ’s and djus,i ’s estimated in the previous subsection.
To estimate the taste parameters {ωj }Jj=1 , we use information on final consumption shares in
the tradeable sectors in the U.S.. We start with a guess of {ωj }Jj=1 and find sectoral prices pkn as
follows. For an initial guess of sectoral prices, we compute the tradeable sector aggregate price and
the nontradeable sector price using the data on the relative prices of nontradeables to tradeables.
Using these prices, we calculate sectoral unit costs and Φjn ’s, and update prices according to
equation (2), iterating until the prices converge. We then update the taste parameters according
to equation (5), using the data on final sectoral expenditure shares in the U.S.. We normalize the
vector of ωj ’s to have a sum of one, and repeat the above procedure until the values for the taste
parameters converge.
Finally, we estimate the nontradeable sector TFP using the relative prices. In the model, the
nontradeable sector price is given by
1

pJ+1
= Γ(TnJ+1 )− θ cJ+1
n
n .
Since we know the aggregate price level in the tradeable sector pTn , cJ+1
n , and the relative price of
nontradeables (which we take from the data), we can back out TnJ+1 from the equation above for
all countries.

Gains from Growth
in Eastern Europe

Notes: This table reports the percentage welfare changes. Column 1 reports the welfare impact of reducing the iceberg trade costs between
West European countries from their 1960s’s levels to their 2000s levels. Column 2 reports the welfare gains from trade relative to complete
autarky. Column 3 reports the welfare gains from trading with EU East European countries. Column 4 reports the gains from trading with
non-EU East European countries, conditional on already trading with EU East European countries. Column 5 reports the welfare impact of
observed productivity growth and capital accumulation in Eastern Europe between the 1990s and the 2000s.

Notes: This table reports the percentage changes in welfare due to the trade integration of Eastern Europe, under the assumption that factors of production cannot reallocate across sectors. It starts with the
counterfactual scenario in which each and every East European country is in autarky, and lowers the trade
costs to their levels as of the 2000s, but assuming that factors cannot reallocate across sectors from their
counterfactual values.

Data labels: WE=Western Europe; EE=Eastern Europe; OO=non-Europe OECD countries; LA=Latin
America and the Caribbean; ME=Middle East and North Africa; AS=East and South Asia; AF=SubSaharan Africa. The first label represents the importing region, the second label the exporting region (thus,
WE←EE is the share of West European imports coming from Eastern Europe).
