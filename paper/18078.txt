ABSTRACT
We propose and illustrate a Markov-switching multi-fractal duration (MSMD) model for analysis
of inter-trade durations in financial markets. We establish several of its key properties with emphasis
on high persistence (indeed long memory). Empirical exploration suggests MSMD's superiority relative
to leading competitors.

Introduction

The necessity of grappling with “big data,” and the desirability of unlocking the information
hidden within it, is a key modern development – arguably the key modern development –
in all the sciences. Time-series econometrics, particularly time-series financial econometrics,
is no exception. Big data in financial econometrics has both cross-sectional and time-series
aspects. In the cross-sectional dimension it arises from the literally hundreds of thousands
of assets that trade in global financial markets. In the time-series dimension it arises from
the similarly huge number of trades, often many per second, that are now routinely executed
for financial assets in liquid markets.
In this paper we are concerned in general with the time-series dimension, and in particular
with the durations associated with inter-trade arrivals. Those trades are facilitated by modern hardware, software and algorithms, and they are continuously recorded electronically.
The result are vast quantities of high-frequency (trade-by-trade) price data.
One might reasonably ask what, precisely, financial econometricians hope to learn from
high-frequency trading data. Interestingly, such high-frequency data emerge as largely uninformative for some objects of interest (e.g., trend, or “drift,” in log price), but highly
informative for others (e.g., volatility), an insight traces in economics at least to Merton
(1980). In particular, although precise estimation of trend benefits greatly from a long calendar span but not from high-frequency sampling, precise estimation of volatility benefits
immensely from high-frequency sampling.1 Accurate volatility estimation and forecasting,
in turn, are crucial for financial risk management, asset pricing and portfolio allocation.
In this paper we are not directly interested in volatility; rather, as mentioned above, we
are interested in inter-trade durations. However, high-frequency data is informative not only
for the properties of volatility, but also for the properties of inter-trade durations. At one
level that observation is trivial, as one obviously needs trade-by-trade data to infer properties
of inter-trade durations. But at another level the observation is quite deep, linked to the
insight that, via time-deformation arguments in the tradition of Clark (1973), properties of
calendar-time volatility and transactions-time trade arrivals should be intimately-related.
In particular, the time-deformation perspective suggests that serial correlation in calendartime volatility is driven by serial correlation in calendar-time trade counts. But serial cor1

Indeed the mathematical foundation of the modern financial econometrics “realized volatility” literature
initiated by Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Labys (2001) and Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002)
is precisely the convergence of empirical quadratic variation to population quadratic variation as sampling
frequency increases.

relation in calendar-time trade counts is driven by serial correlation in transactions-time
trade-arrival intensity, which is ultimately driven by serial correlation in the information
flow that drives trading. Hence the calendar-time “realized volatility” persistence revealed
by high-frequency data should have parallels in calendar-time trade count persistence and
transaction-time inter-trade duration persistence. Interestingly, the key and robust finding for realized volatility dynamics is not only high volatility persistence (of course...), but
tremendously high volatility persistence, in the form of long memory.2
Against this background, in this paper we propose and evaluate a new model of intertrade durations, closely-linked to the pioneering “multi-fractal” return volatility model of
Mandelbrot, Fisher, and Calvet (1997), Calvet and Fisher (2001) and Calvet and Fisher
(2004) as discussed and extended in Calvet and Fisher (2008). As we will discuss subsequently in detail, our model’s construction and implications are quite different from existing
dynamic duration models, most notably the prominent Autoregressive Conditional Duration
(ACD) model of Engle and Russell (1998) and variants thereof. Our model, which we call
the Markov-switching multi-fractal duration (MSMD) model, captures high persistence in
duration clustering; indeed it intrinsically captures long memory while nevertheless maintaining covariance stationarity. It also captures additional important features of observed
durations, such as over-dispersion. Finally, as we will also demonstrate, it is highly successful
empirically, largely dominating ACD.
We proceed as follows. In section 2, we review the important empirical regularities that
routinely emerge in inter-trade durations in financial markets. In section 3 we develop our
MSMD model, we characterize its properties relative to the earlier-documented empirical
regularities. We also relate the MSMD model to other models that have appeared in the
literature, such as the ACD model and the Stochastic Conditional Duration (SCD) model
of Bauwens and Veredas (2004). In section 4 we apply the MSMD model to inter-trade
duration data for a representative set of U.S. equities, evaluating its performance in both
absolute terms as well as relative to the prominent ACD model. We conclude in section 5.

Empirical Regularities in Inter-Trade Duration Data

Here we highlight three important regularities in financial market inter-trade durations,
illustrating them for a particular U.S. equity (Citigroup). We shall be interested subsequently

Findings of long memory in realized volatility run consistently from the early work of Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Labys (2001) through scores of subsequent studies, as surveyed for example in Andersen,
Bollerslev, Christoffersen, and Diebold (2013).

in econometric duration models that capture those regularities.

2.1

Serially-Correlated Duration Dynamics and Self-Similar Clustering

Durations are highly persistent, as is clear visually from the time-series plot of Citigroup durations in Figure 1.3 The transactions-time duration clustering is matched by a corresponding calendar time transactions-count clustering. Moreover, the calendar-time transactions
count clustering tends to look similar regardless of observational frequency. In Figure 2, for
example, we show Citigroup transaction counts in intervals of length 2, 5, 10 and 30 minutes
during February 1993. Such invariance of qualitative features to observational frequency is
called self-similarity and has long been emphasized in financial asset returns, particularly by
Mandelbrot (e.g., Mandelbrot (1997)).

2.2

Over-Dispersion

Another property of inter-trade durations, related to their high persistence, is over-dispersion.
Over-dispersion refers to the standard deviation exceeding the mean, in contrast to the equality that would obtain with exponential durations generated by iid trade arrivals. In Figure
3, for example, we show an exponential duration Q-Q plot for the Citigroup durations, which
clearly indicates a non-exponential duration distribution characterized by a longer right tail
than would occur under the exponential. Indeed the the sample standard deviation is 2.63

We have adjusted the durations for calendar effects and will provide details subsequently in section 4.1.

and the sample mean is only 1.93. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test rejects the
exponential null hypothesis at a marginal significance level less than 10−6 .

2.3

Long Memory

We have already mentioned duration persistence and clustering, but we have saved for last
the most important aspect of that persistence: long memory. Consider again the Citigroup
duration data.4 The time-series plot in Figure 1 clearly reveals high persistence, but the slow
hyperbolic decay of the sample autocorrelation function in Figure 4 reveals significantly more.
As is well-known, covariance stationary long memory dynamics are associated with very slow
(hyperbolic) autocorrelation decay, in contrast to covariance-stationary short-memory (e.g.,
ARMA) dynamics, which are associated with very quick (exponential) autocorrelation decay.
It is interesting to note that long memory is self-similar. That is, it can be shown that
if a flow variable like transactions counts is I(d) at one observational frequency, then it is
I(d) at all other observational frequencies. Hence the observed long memory in duration

and transaction count dynamics coheres with the earlier-mentioned observed self-similarity
in transaction-count clustering.

The Markov-Switching Multi-Fractal Duration Model

In this section we propose the Markov-Switching Multi-fractal Duration (MSMD) model and
study its properties, proceeding as follows. In section 3.1 we sketch its basic structure, a
mixture-of-exponentials representation with dynamics driven by a Markov-switching multifractal intensity process. In section 3.2 we establish some important properties of the MSMD
model that match the earlier-documented features of inter-trade durations. In section 3.3 we
provide an illustrative simulation. In section 3.4 we explore the relationship of the MSMD
model to the general class of point processes. Finally, in section 3.5 we situate the MSMD
model within some of the broader literature in inter-trade duration modeling, comparing
and contrasting MSMD to existing approaches.

3.1

A New Model for Inter-Trade Durations

We specify our dynamic model of durations in terms of a mixture of exponential random
variables in which the intensity evolves dynamically. Working in precisely parallel fashion
to the multi-fractal stochastic volatility model of Calvet and Fisher (2008), we assume that

the intensities are composed multiplicatively of k̄ dynamic components following two-state
Markov-switching processes with different degrees of persistence, ranging from very low to
very high. This produces the Markov-switching multi-fractal duration (MSMD) model.
Let us now introduce the model. We use di = ti − ti−1 to denote the duration between
trades (events) occurring at times ti and ti−1 . The durations are distributed according to
di ∼

i

i ∼ iidExp(1),

i = 1, . . . , n,

(1)

where Exp(1) refers to an exponential distribution with intensity parameter 1. Conditional
on λi , the durations have a Exp(λi ) distribution, and we refer to the λi ’s as (mean) intensities.
The intensities evolve according to the following Markov-switching multi-fractal process:

λi = λ

k̄
Y

Mk,i ,

(2)

k=1

where λ is a positive constant and the Mk,i ’s are positive intensity components, independent
across k and following Markov renewal processes. That is, at time i Mk,i is either renewed
(drawn from a fixed distribution f (M )) or kept at its previous value, k ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., k̄}. We
write
(
draw from f (M ) w.p. γk
Mk,i =
(3)
Mk,i−1
w.p. 1 − γk ,
where the renewal distribution f (M ) is identical for all k = 1, ..., k̄, with M > 0 and
7

E(M ) = 1. Renewal of Mk,i corresponds to a new shock of type k hitting the system at
time i, with the draw from f (M ) governing the magnitude of the shock. The value of
γk determines the average lifetime and hence the persistence of an M shock. A large γk
corresponds to M shocks with short expected lifetime and low persistence, and conversely.
Consider now the renewal distribution f (M ). We take it as discrete, with two equallylikely points of support,
(
m0
w.p. 1/2
M=
(4)
2 − m0 w.p. 1/2,
where m0 ∈ (0, 2]. We refer to this distribution as “binomial,” although it differs slightly
from a standard 0-1 Bernoulli trial. Note that the condition m0 ∈ (0, 2] implies M > 0
a.s. and E(M ) = 1, as required. By combining (3) and (4) we obtain a two-state Markov
process for Mk,i that alternates between the states s1 = m0 and s2 = 2 − m0 with transition
probabilities

#
1 − γk /2
γk /2
P(γk ) =

(5)
γk /2
1 − γk /2
Here element jl of the matrix P(γk ) specifies the transition from state sj to sl . The largest
eigenvalue of P(γk ) is equal to one, which implies that the Markov process has an equilibrium
distribution. The equilibrium probabilities of states s1 and s2 are 1/2 regardless of γk . The
second eigenvalue is equal to 1 − γk and determines the persistence of the Markov chain.
Finally, to induce parsimony, we impose the following restriction on the sequence {γk }k̄k=1 :
k−k̄

γk = 1 − (1 − γk̄ )b

,

(6)

where γk̄ ∈ (0, 1) and b ∈ (1, ∞). Hence, although the renewal distribution f (Mk ) is the same
for all intensity components Mk , the renewal probability, γk , differs across k, creating a variety
of intensity components ranging from low-frequency components that renew infrequently to
high-frequency components that renew frequently, despite the fact that all renewals are of
course stochastic. Small values of k relative to k̄ lead to large values of 1 − γk and therefore
produce “low-frequency” or “long-run” Mk shocks with low renewal probability and hence
long expected lifetime and high persistence.
Equations (1), (2), (3), (4), and (6) define the MSMD model. Assembling everything, we
can write it compactly as

where i ∼ iid exp(1), k̄ ∈ N, λ > 0, γk̄ ∈ (0, 1), b ∈ (1, ∞) and m0 ∈ (0, 2]. Conditional
on k̄ we collect the remaining parameters in the vector θk̄ = (λ, γk̄ , b, m0 )0 . Note that
the MSMD model has a k̄-dimensional state vector Mi = (M1,i , M2,i , . . . Mk̄,i ), and hence
2k̄ states, despite its great parsimony (just four parameters, regardless of k̄). Each latent
intensity component takes the value m0 in the high state and 2 − m0 in the low state. The
parameter λ governs the overall intensity level; if all intensity components are in the high
state, then λi = mk̄0 (the upper bound for intensity) and if all intensity components are in
the low state, then λi = (2 − m0 )k̄ (the lower bound for intensity). The parameter γk̄ is
the renewal probability of the most frequently-renewing intensity component Mk̄ . The other
renewal probabilities γ1 , ..., γk̄−1 increase monotonically (and at an increasing rate) toward
γk̄ , with the precise pattern governed by the parameter b.

3.2

Implied Dynamics and Distributions

Here we study some properties of MSMD processes. We begin by showing stationarity,
finite moments and ergodicity. Then we show that MSMD processes are consistent with the
earlier-documented key stylized features of inter-trade financial market durations: seriallycorrelated duration dynamics and self-similar clustering, over-dispersion and long memory.
Stationarity, Ergodicity, and Finite Moments. Provided that γk > 0, the transition
probability matrix (5) implies that the process Mk,i is strictly stationary and ergodic. Moreover, because the Mk,i processes are independent across k and independent of i , and because
the i ’s are independent across i, the vector process ξi = (i , M1,i , . . . , Mk̄,i ) is strictly stationary and ergodic. Because the durations di are a measurable function of ξi , it follows that
the sequence of durations is strictly stationary and ergodic. Because the moments of the
Exp(1) distribution are finite and there exists an upper bound λ̄ and a lower bound λ > 0
such that λ ≤ λi ≤ λ̄ for all i, we deduce that the moments of di are finite.
Serially-Correlated Duration Dynamics and Self-Similar Clustering. The MSMD
model produces serially-correlated durations by design, due to the serial correlation in its
conditional intensity, which in turn produces serial correlation in calendar-time transaction
counts (clustering). Such clustering matches the predictions of many theoretical market
9

microstructure models. Those models emphasize the simultaneous presence of informed and
uninformed traders, with informed trades occurring only when informational events occur,
which produces transaction clustering in calendar time.5
Over-Dispersion. MSMD processes also display over-dispersion. The Exp(1) distribution
of i implies that E[i ] = 1 and E[2i ] = 2. Recall that di = i /λi . Because i and λi are
independent, we deduce from Jensen’s Inequality that
−1 2
V ar(di ) = 2E[λ−2
i ] − (E[λi ])

(8)

−1 2
2
≥ 2(E[λ−1
i ]) − (E[λi ])

= (E[di ])2 .
The inequality is strict if the distribution of λi has a non-zero variance, which leads to the
over-dispersion property
p
V ar(di ) > E[di ].
(9)
It is interesting to note that, in the MSMD model and in reality, the over-dispersion
of transactions-time duration distributions is induced by stochastic intensity. This is precisely analogous to the well-known fat-tails of calendar-time return distributions induced
by stochastic volatility. Just as stochastic volatility “fattens” Gaussian conditional return
distributions, so too does MSMD “over-disperse” exponential conditional duration distributions.
Long Memory. We now show that the MSMD process has long memory, by showing that
the duration autocorrelation function, ρ(h) = Corr(di , di+h ), decays hyperbolically. We
begin by letting α1 < α2 denote two arbitrary numbers in the open interval (0, 1). Then the
set of integers Hk̄ = {h : α1 logb (bk̄ ) ≤ logb h ≤ α2 logb (bk̄ )} contains a broad collection of
lags. Notice that as k̄ → ∞ the values of h included in the set Hk̄ also tend to infinity. The
formal statement of the long-memory property is provided in the following proposition.

which highlights that φi is also a Markov-switching multi-fractal process. The autocovariances of φi are not affected by the factor µk̄ /λ. Thus, with this transformation the MSMD duration process di = φi has effectively the same probabilistic structure as the squared return
process rt2 in Calvet and Fisher (2008), and the long-memory property of the durations follows
from their Proposition 1.
Q.E.D.
As shown in Proposition 1, the overlaid Markov-switching processes in the MSMD model
truly generate long memory in durations.6 The MSMD long memory is reminiscent of wellknown earlier results showing that long memory is obtained by aggregating short-memory
processes of differing persistence. Those results include both aggregation of simple AR(1)
processes in discrete time as in Granger (1980) and aggregation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in continuous time as in Cox (1981).7 Moreover, although the long memory arising in
such environments is a limiting result as the number of component processes grows (k̄ → ∞
in the case of MSMD), authors such as Alizadeh, Brandt, and Diebold (2002) have argued
that that the limiting result holds quickly. Hence only a few components should be needed
to approximate long memory accurately.

We calibrate the MSMD model with k̄ = 7, and with parameters that match our subsequently-reported
estimates for Citigroup.

3.3

An Illustrative Simulation

To build insight we provide an illustrative simulation of the MSMD model. We calibrate the
parameters to our later-obtained estimates for Citigroup (m0 = 1.23, λ = 1.17, γk̄ = 0.18,
b = 4.52), and we use k̄ = 7, which emerges as widely adequate in our subsequent empirical
work.
In Figure 5 we show the renewal probabilities γk implied by our choices of γk̄ , k̄ and b
k−k̄
(recall that γk = 1 − (1 − γk̄ )b ), for k = 3, ..., 7. For smaller values of k, the renewal
probabilities are very small and increasing only slowly, but they increase quickly starting
around k = 5, reaching 0.18 when k = k̄ = 7.
In Figure 6 we show time series of simulated latent intensity components M1,i , ..., M7,i ,
overall latent intensities λi , and durations di . Despite the sample of length greater than
22,000 (again chosen to match our subsequent empirical work), the switching probabilities
of M1 and M2 are so low that they never switch regime. Switching begins with M3 and
increases in frequency as we approach the highest-frequency component M7 , which switches
very often. The resulting overall intensity and duration series are very highly persistent,

In this regard the MSMD environment with k̄ → ∞ is very different from the simple two-state Markovswitching environment studied by Diebold and Inoue (2001), who show in that environment how shortmemory dynamics can be mis-diagnosed as long-memory.

In Figure 7 we show an exponential QQ plot of the simulated durations. It clearly
indicates a longer right tail than exponential, consistent with overdispersion. Indeed the
exponential Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic has a p-value less than 2.2e-16.
In Figure 8 we show the sample autocorrelation function of the simulated durations, which
makes clear that they are more than just highly-persistent but short-memory; instead, their
slow hyperbolic decay indicates long memory.

3.4

MSMD, Point Process Theory, and Time Deformation

We now relate situate the MSMD approach within the broader framework of general point
process theory.8 We focus not on the Markov-switching multi-fractal process for λi , as we
have discussed it previously and will return to it subsequently. Rather, we step back for
a moment to consider the broader background associated with our parameterizing the the
conditional intensity in a mixture-of-exponentials representation.
Formally, a point process (PP) on (0, ∞) is a sequence of nonnegative random variables
{Ti (ω)}i∈1,2,... defined on a probability space (Ω, F, P ), satisfying 0 < T1 (ω) < T2 (ω) < · · · ,
where Ti is the instant of the i-th occurrence of an event. A PP is associated with a counting
P
process, N (t, ω), where N (t, ω) =
i≥1 1(Ti (ω) ≤ t) is the number of events up to and
including time t. Under suitable regularity conditions the PP can be characterized by a
stochastic intensity λ(t, ω). The heuristic interpretation of the process λ(t, ω) is that of a
conditional hazard function:

P [N (t + ∆t, ω) − N (t, ω) = 1 | Ft− ] ,
(12)
λ(t, ω) = lim

where Ft− is a sub-sigma field of F and can be intuitively interpreted as information available
at time t−. Conditional on Ft− information, the intensity λ(t, ω) is non-stochastic, which is

Throughout this subsection we only provide a brief heuristic discussion. For a more rigorous and complete
treatment, see for example see Karr (1991) and Daley and Vere-Jones (2003, 2007).

one for each t. If we observe the process over the interval (0, T ] then the probability of
“successes,” i.e. observing trades in the context of our application, at times t1 , . . . , tn is
Q
given by ni=1 λ(ti ). Likewise, the probability of no successes in the interval (ti−1 , ti ) is given
R ti
λ(t)dt]. Combining these two expressions, we deduce that the probability of

Suppose that λ(t) is constant on the interval [ti−1 , ti ) and denote its value by λi . Moreover,

which exactly corresponds to the mixture-of-exponentials specification (1).
Interestingly, the MSMD mixture-of-exponential representation can also be motivated
using a time-deformation argument. Provided that the stochastic intensity λ(t, ω) exists
R∞
and satisfies the condition 0 λ(t, ω) = ∞ almost surely, meaning that one always expects
more trades in the context of our application, one can define the (stochastic) stopping time
R τ (t,ω)
τ (t, ω) as the (unique) solution to 0
λ(s, ω)ds = t. It turns out that the process Ñ (t, ω)
defined by Ñ (t, ω) = N (τ (t, ω), ω) is a standard Poisson process with intensity one. As a

as in (1).

On the Comparative Structure of MSMD and Other InterTrade Duration Models

Duration dynamics and volatility dynamics are by necessity intimately related. In particular,
we have noted the close link between the Markov-switching multi-fractal duration (MSMD)
model and the pioneering Calvet-Fisher Markov-switching multi-fractal volatility (MSMV)
model. But MSMD is not, of course, the first or only dynamic duration model, just as MSMV
is not the first or only dynamic volatility model. Here, therefore, we contrast MSMD to some
obvious competing dynamic duration models. We organize our discussion along four lines:
mean intensity vs. mean duration models, parameter-driven vs. observation-driven models,
long-memory vs. short-memory models, and “structural” vs. “reduced-form” long memory
models. Throughout, we use the popular autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model
as an anchoring benchmark.9
Mean Intensity vs. Mean Duration. The ACD model of Engle and Russell (1998),
which is parameterized in terms of the conditional mean duration, was the key breakthrough
in modeling financial market inter-trade durations, and many varieties of ACD models now
exist. The “multiplicative error model” (MEM) originally suggested by Engle (2002) is
closely related; indeed ACD is a special case of MEM.10 ACD/MEM assumes that
di = ϕi i ,

(15)

where ϕi = E(di |di−1 , ..., d1 ) and i ∼ iid(1, σ 2 ), and it focuses on parameterizing the
conditional mean duration, ϕi . We have shown in section 3.2, however, that the MSMD
mean-intensity model can be easily re-written as a mean-duration model where the mean
duration follows a Markov-switching process. Hence the mean-intensity and mean-duration
approaches are evidently more similar than might appear at first glance.
Parameter-Driven vs. Observation-Driven. A key difference between ACD/MEM and
MSMD concerns “observation-driven” vs. “parameter-driven” structure. In the parlance of
9

Hautsch (2012) provides a fine overview of much of the relevant literature on financial duration modeling.
The MEM literature has also grown impressively; see, for example, Brownlees, Cipollini, and Gallo
(2012) and Hautsch (2012).
10

16

Cox (1981), a model is observation-driven if conditional dynamics are driven by the history of
observables (as for example in traditional ARCH volatility models), whereas it is parameterdriven if conditional dynamics are driven by the history of a latent variable (as for example
in traditional stochastic volatility models).
The ACD model, as well as the important score-driven MEM extensions emphasized
by Creal, Koopman, and Lucas (2010) and Harvey (2011), are clearly and intrinsically
observation-driven. Their construction precisely parallels the ARCH model, which is also
observation-driven. The motivating recognition is that the likelihood may always be factored
into a product of conditional densities, where the conditioning is on observed historical data,
so that if one specifies a model directly in terms of those conditional densities then likelihood
evaluation is immediate and simple.
In contrast, the MSMD model is parameter-driven, as the evolution of the mean intensity
follows a hidden Markov process. Rich MSMD duration dynamics arise from the large MSMD
state space (recall that λi can take 2k̄ distinct values). Simultaneously, however, MSMD is
parsimonious. In addition to k̄, which determines the total number of duration states,
MSMD uses only two parameters, namely b and γk̄ , to determine the transition probabilities
in this high-dimensional state-space. However, as we discuss below in section 4.3, likelihood
evaluation is a bit more challenging (although still simple) for parameter-driven MSMD than
for observation-driven ACD/MEM. In particular, MSMD likelihood evaluation requires use
of a nonlinear filter as in Hamilton (1989).
The MSMD model is of course not the first parameter-driven duration model. For example, the Stochastic Conditional Duration (SCD) model of Bauwens and Veredas (2004), specifies the log expected duration (ln ϕi in the notation of (15)) as an autoregressive process.11
Hence if ACD is the duration analogue of the GARCH model, then SCD is the duration analogue of the stochastic volatility model. Finally, Hautsch (2008) combines parameter-driven
and observation-driven dynamics in a so-called stochastic ACD model.
Long-Memory vs. Short-Memory. Another key difference between ACD/MEM (as
typically implemented) and MSMD concerns long memory. Before considering transactionstime durations, first consider calendar-time volatility. The volatility literature features long
memory prominently. For example, long memory is routinely found and modeled in realized
volatility calculated using intra-day data, as for example in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold,
and Labys (2003). Indeed long memory features prominently even in the “conventional”
stochastic volatility literature without intra-day data, as for example in the pioneering work
11

Meddahi, Renault, and Werker (1998) also propose an interesting and closely-related model.

17

of Comte and Renault (1998) and Breidt, Crato, and De Lima (1998).
Now consider durations. The existing inter-trade dynamic duration modeling literature
that began with Engle and Russell (1998) is of course aware of high persistence in intertrade duration dynamics, and it works hard to capture that persistence. But given the close
relationship between duration dynamics and volatility dynamics (and again, the routine
finding of long memory in volatility dynamics), as well as the direct and model-free empirical
evidence of long memory in inter-trade durations presented in section 2.3, long memory has
been curiously absent from most of the duration literature. Two notable exceptions are the
fractionally integrated ACD model of Jasiak (1999) (FI-ACD) and the long memory version
of the SCD model proposed by Deo, Hsieh, and Hurvich (2010). MSMD is firmly in this
long-memory camp.
Structural vs. Reduced-Form Long Memory.
The MSMD model’s long-memory durations have an appealing structural flavor; that is,
MSMD provides a natural long-memory duration generating mechanism by overlaying simple
regime-switching processes with different degrees of persistence, potentially corresponding to
market activity of different types of informed and uninformed traders. The regime-switching
MSMD intensity components in turn parallel earlier two-state regime-switching models in
the tradition of Hamilton (1989).
The structural long memory model of MSMD contrasts to “reduced-form” long memory
model of Granger and Joyeux (1980). That approach works directly with representations of
the form (1 − L)d yt = xt , where xt is a short-memory process, and 0 < d < 1/2, with the
fractional differencing operator (1 − L)d defined via the expansion
(1 − L)d = 1 − dL +

d(d − 1) 2 d(d − 1)(d − 2) 3
L −
L + ...
2!
3!

Such a series is said to be (fractionally-) integrated of order d, and we write yt ∼ I(d).
From the reduced-form perspective, all shocks have identical hyperbolically-decaying effects. That is the case, for example, with the reduced-form long-memory duration models
of Jasiak (1999) and Deo, Hsieh, and Hurvich (2010). An attractive feature of MSMD,
however, is its decomposition of reduced-form long memory into structural short-memory
pieces coming from underlying cyclical variation at different frequencies, which again may
correspond to market activity of different groups of informed and uninformed traders.

Empirical Analysis of U.S. Equities

Here we apply the MSMD model to twenty-five U.S. equities selected randomly from those
in the S&P 100 index. We study consolidated trade data extracted from the TAQ database.
The sample period covers twenty trading days, from February 1, 1993 to February 26, 1993,
10:00 - 16:00.12 Here in the main text we summarize graphically the results for all firms
collectively, and we provide details for Citigroup, whose results are typical. In the appendices
we provide details for all firms individually. We list the firms and their ticker symbols in
Table 1.

4.1

Intra-Day Calendar Effects

Just as with intra-day volatility in calendar time, durations display intra-day calendar effects. In particular, inter-trade durations tend to be shorter early and late in the day, and
longer around lunch. Although the calendar effects are mild, they are nevertheless desirably
removed prior to analysis. We do so using a simple deterministic dummv variable approach,
as in Ghysels, Gourièroux, and Jasiak (2004). We divide the trading day into half-hour
12

Trading also occurs 09:30-10:00, but following standard procedure (e.g., Engle and Russell (1998)), we
delete transactions in 09:30-10:00 to remove effects of the opening auction.

dˆi = di exp(−â0 xi ).
From this point onward, we use such adjusted durations exclusively, but in slight abuse of
notation we use di instead of dˆi to refer to our observations.

In addition, we provide numerical details in Appendix A.

Descriptive Statistics for Adjusted Durations

In Figure 10 we summarize the duration distributions for the twenty-five stocks using boxand-whisker plots, with Citigroup labeled. All show long right tails indicative of overdispersion. This is confirmed in Figure 11, in which we show a histogram of coefficients of variation
(the standard deviation relative to the mean), for all twenty-five stocks. All are greater than
one, and the distribution has a long right tail.14 In Figure 12 we focus on dynamics rather
than distributions, showing a profile bundle of sample autocorrelation functions (to displacement 200) for all twenty-five firms. The slow hyperbolic decay is apparent.

4.3

Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Prior to obtaining maximum-likelihood estimates, we first discuss here the likelihood function
for a sequence of durations d1:n = {d1 , . . . , dn } governed by the MSMD model. By conditional
factorization of the joint density, the likelihood is immediately
p(d1:n |θk̄ ) = p(d1 |θk̄ )

Coefficient of Variation

Figure 11: Distribution of Duration Coefficients of Variation Across Firms. We
show a histogram of coefficients of variation (the standard deviation relative to the mean), as a measure of
overdispersion relative to the exponential.

Conditional on λi , each duration di simply has an Exp(λi ) distribution with density p(di |λi ) =
λi exp[−λi di ], so evaluation of the likelihood would be trivial if the sequence of λi ’s were
known. But the λi ’s are of course not known and must be replaced with estimates from
an optimal filter as in Hamilton (1989), the only difference being that the MSMD model
has 2k̄ states rather than Hamilton’s 2 state. To streamline the exposition we focus on the
case of k̄ = 2, for a total of 4 states; generalization to k̄ > 2 is obvious but notationally
tedious. Recall that we abbreviated the potential values of the states Mk,i by s1 = m0 and
s2 = 2 − m0 . Using this notation, λi can take four values, λi ∈ {λs1 s1 , λs1 s2 , λs2 s1 , λs2 s2 }.
Because the states Mk,i evolve independently, the matrix of transition probabilities for the
mean intensity is simply Pλ = P(γ1 ) ⊗ P(γ2 ), where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product and
P(γk ) was defined in (5). In slight abuse of notation, we characterize the distribution of
λi through densities p(λi |·). Then we evaluate the likelihood recursively. First we initialize
the hidden states with their equilibrium distribution in period i = 0. Then starting from
p(λi−1 |d1:i−1 , θk̄ ) we obtain the i’th point likelihood by evaluating conditional distribution
p(λi |d1:i−1 , θk̄ ) (forecast of the mean intensity), then p(di |d1:i−1 , θk̄ ) (forecast of the duration),
and then finally the desired p(λi |d1:i , θk̄ ) (updating).
As discussed in Section 3.1, the MSMD model is a hidden Markov model. Its parameter
vector is given by θk̄ = (λ, γk̄ , b, m0 )0 and the number of states is 2k̄ . Hence k̄ can be
viewed as a model index, and we will use the notation Mj to denote a MSMD model with

k̄ = j. While k̄ affects the number of hidden states in the MSMD model, it does not alter
the dimensionality of the parameter vector θk̄ . In this sense the MSMD model remains
parsimonious even if k̄ is large.
Models Mj and Ml , j ≤ l are essentially non-nested. For instance, consider M1 versus
M2 . For model M1 the intensity can take the values λi ∈ {λ1 m0,1 , λ1 (2 − m0,1 )}, whereas
the for M2 the intensity switches among λi ∈ {λ2 m20,2 , λ2 m0,2 (2 − m0,2 ), λ2 m20,2 }. Recall that
the sequence {γk }k̄k=1 that determines the transition probabilities P(γk ) of the k’th intensity
component Mk,i is given by
k−k̄
γk = 1 − (1 − γk̄ )b .
This restriction ensures that M1 and M2 are only nested if either b = 1 and γk̄ = 1 or
m0 = 1. The first case is explicitly excluded from the parameter space and the second case
turned out to be empirically irrelevant.
We estimate the parameter vector θk̄ of model Mk̄ by maximizing the log likelihood
function: θ̂k̄ = argmaxθk̄ ∈Θ ln p(d1:n |θk̄ , Mk̄ ) using the adjusted durations. The MSMD
model potentially suffers from the following identification problems. For γk̄ = 1 the decay
parameter b is non-identifiable. While we exclude γk̄ = 1 from the parameter space – recall
that γk̄ ∈ (0, 1) – the decay parameter becomes weakly identified near the upper bound for
γk̄ . As b approaches its lower bound of one, the sequence {γk }k̄k=1 approaches a sequence
of constants. In the limit, the intensity components Mk,i become exchangeable. Finally, if

parameter estimates as a function of k̄, for k̄ = 3, ..., 7. The bold profiles are Citigroup.
m0 ∈ (0, 2] equals one, then the intensity components are identical across states and neither
b nor γk̄ are identifiable.
We implement the maximum-likelihood estimation in MATLAB using the fmincon function to carry out a constrained maximization. After some experimentation we selected the
interior-point option of the optimization algorithm. The empirically relevant bound on the
parameters turns out to be γk̄ < 1, which we enforce by supplying the fmincon function
with an upper bound of 0.999 for γk̄ . The identification problems associated with b = 1 and
m0 = 1 did not turn out to be empirically relevant. For each estimation, we explore a grid
of starting values for the minimization routine. The computational time is increasing in 2k̄ .
For instance, for k̄ = 10 the state transition matrix is a 1024 × 1024 matrix that needs to
be re-calculated for every evaluation of the likelihood function. Moreover, the filter has to
track probabilities for 1024 states. Fortunately, however, such high k̄ values are empirically
unnecessary, as we now show.

4.4

Parameter Estimates

We proceed as follows. First we discuss profile bundles for each estimated parameter (that
is, parameter estimates as a function of k̄, for each firm). Second, we discuss profile bundles
for maximized likelihoods as a function of k̄, which generally indicate that k̄ = 7 is adequate.
Third, given the general adequacy of k̄ = 7, we discuss parameter distributions across firms
conditional on k̄ = 7. In keeping with our running Citigroup example, we highlight Citigroup
results throughout. We present detailed estimation results in Appendix C.
First, consider the parameter estimate profile bundles in Figure 13. Citigroup’s m0
estimates are robust and slightly decreasing across k̄, with m̂0 = 1.33, ..., 1.23 for k̄ = 3, ..., 7,
respectively. The entire profile bundle of m0 estimates behaves similarly. Citigroup’s λ

estimates are rather stable in k̄, but there is a noticeable increase when moving from k̄ = 6
to k̄ = 7, with λ̂0 = 0.79, 0.98, 0.88, 0.70, 1.17 for k̄ = 3, ..., 7, respectively. Most firms’
λ̂ profiles are quite stable, but a few are noticeably “bumpy.” Citigroup’s b estimates are
monotonically decreasing in k̄, with b̂ = 14.22, ..., 4.52 for k̄ = 3, ..., 7, respectively. Most
firms’ b̂ profiles are stable or slightly decreasing in k̄. Citigroup’s γk̄ are quite stable in k̄
with, for example, γ̂k̄ = 0.18, 0.18, 0.18 for k̄ = 5, 6, 7, respectively. As for the profile bundle
of γk̄ estimates, recall that γk̄ is the renewal probability of the most frequently-renewing
latent intensity component. Interestingly, the profile bundles separate rather neatly into
“high” and “low” groups.
Now we focus on profile bundles of maximized log likelihood functions ln p(d1:n |θ̂k̄ , Mk̄ ),
which we show in Figure 14. In particular, we show log likelihood differentials with respect
to k̄ = 7, which is therefore identically equal to 0, and moreover, a profile increasing in k̄
corresponds to a likelihood increasing in k̄. Most profiles increase in k̄ and level off quickly,
around k̄ = 4; a few are basically flat in k̄. While the largest log-likelihood differential is
-85, most of the differentials are less than 10 in absolute value. Since the model complexity,
i.e. number of parameters, does not increase with k̄ the log-likelihood differentials may be
interpreted as log-posterior odds. It is rare that the log-likelihood differential is positive and
if it is the evidence in favor of k̄ < 7 tends to be small. The Citigroup profile fits the general
pattern, increasing from k̄ = 3 to k̄ = 4, and then staying roughly constant.

Figure 15: Distributions of MSMD Parameter Estimates Across Firms, k̄ = 7. We
show histograms of maximum likelihood parameter estimates across firms, obtained using k̄ = 7. The arrow
denotes Citigroup.

Given the log likelihood results, we now focus exclusively on k̄ = 7 and consider crossfirm distributions of parameter estimates, as summarized in Figure 15. The distribution of
m0 estimates is skewed, with most estimates around roughly 1.25, but some as high as 1.4 or
even 1.5. The distribution of λ estimates is quite dispersed, with some estimates greater than
1 and some less. Most firms’ λ̂ are less than or near 1, but there is again a long right tail.
The distribution of b estimates is yet again right-skewed, with a mode in the neighborhood of
7. The distribution of γk̄ estimates, in contrast, is strongly bimodal, with a low “low mode”
(near 0) and a high “high mode” (near 1), corresponding to the earlier-discussed separation
of γk̄ profile bundles into “high” and “low” groups.
In Figure 16 we assemble the information in the various parameter estimates in an informative way. We show latent intensity component (Mk ) renewal probability profile bundles,
k−k̄
estimated using k̄ = 7. That is, for each firm we show γk = 1 − (1 − γk̄ )b
as a function
of k, k = 3, ..., 7, where k̄ = 7.15 Because the estimated b tends to be substantially larger
than 1 for all firms, bk−k̄ is close to zero for small values of k and all profiles have similarly
small γk ’s for k ≤ 3. But as k grows, a clear bifurcation emerges, with roughly half the
profiles rising only slowly, and half rising much more quickly toward 1. Citigroup is one of
the “slowly-rising” firms, with γk rising from approximately 0 to .18 for as k goes from 3 to
7, meaning that its inter-trade durations are quite persistent.
15

Recall that 1 − γk corresponds to the eigenvalue of the transition probability matrix P(γk ) that governs
the persistence of the intensity component Mk . Thus, firms for which γk stays close to zero have very
persistent inter-trade durations.

Absolute and Relative MSMD Performance

We now examine the performance of the estimated MSMD model, considering absolute fit
as well as measures of relative fit and forecasting performance. We assess absolute performance of the MSMD model using White’s information matrix test, and we assess performance relative to the leading ACD(1,1) competitor using Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) differentials as well as pseudo-out-of-sample root-mean-squared forecast error (RMSE)
differentials.16
White’s Information-Matrix Test for MSMD(7).
Given the mixture-of-exponentials structure of the MSMD model, we could presumably
construct specification tests based on the residual ˆi = di λ̂i , assessing whether the residuals
are iid exponential after accounting for the fact that the residual is based on the estimate
λ̂i rather than the true λi .17 Instead we take a different and general approach, performing
the information matrix (IM) test of White (1982), which is a generic specification test for
models estimated by MLE.
White (1982)’s IM test was originally developed for models with iid observations. Extensions to time series models are discussed, for instance, in White (1994). In the context of
16

We consider the ACD(1,1) model because it is a widely-used benchmark in the literature. We chose the
ubiquitous (1,1) specification based on preliminary empirical investigation.
17
In fact, such tests have a long tradition in the specification analysis of point process models that rely on
the time-deformation result discussed in Section 3.4 (e.g., Ogata (1988)).

Under correct specification, the score process should be a martingale difference sequence.
The so-called second-order IM tests mimic White (1982)’s test for iid data and assess the
large-sample equivalence of the Hessian and the outer product of scores.
We report p-values for a second-order IM test (see White (1994, Section 11.1). We use all
10 non-redundant elements of the information matrix to form the test statistic W hite. Under
the null hypothesis of correct specification the limit distribution takes the form W hite ∼ χ210 .
In Figure 17 we show the profile bundle of White statistic p-values. There is rather wide
variation, but there is also a clear pattern of increase in W hite statistics with k̄. Indeed
for the preferred value of k̄ = 7, almost none of the twenty-five p-values are less than 0.05.
Thus the second-order IM test generally reveals little or no evidence in the data against our
preferred MSMD specification.
Bayesian Information Criterion for MSMD(7) vs. ACD(1,1). We now consider the
performance of MSMD(7) relative to the canonical ACD(1,1) model. The ACD(1,1) model
is
di = ϕi i
(17)
ϕi = ω + αdi−1 + βϕi−1
i ∼ iidExp(1)

D = BICMSMD − BICACD

Figure 18: Distribution of Differences in BIC Values Across Firms, γ k̄ = 7. We
compute differences as MSMD - ACD. We show a histogram.

The ACD(1,1) has three parameters whereas our MSMD(7) model has four parameters. We
estimate both models by maximum likelihood and use the Bayesian information criterion,
BIC = −2 ln L + k ln(n), to adjust the maximized likelihood function for model complexity,
that is, the number of estimated parameters.18 In Figure 18 we show the distribution of BIC
differences (BICM SM D − BICACD ). The differences are typically large, and the distribution
is centered around 600. For Citigroup the BIC differential is 200. To put the number into
perspective consider the following back-of-the-envelope calculation. The sample consists of
22,988 observations. Dividing the differential by the number of observations yields 0.013.
Thus, from a Bayesian perspective, on average each duration observation shifts the odds in
favor of the MSMD model by a factor of 1.013. Thus, while each individual observation
only provides weak evidence in favor of our specification, the nearly 23,000 observations in
combination provide overwhelming evidence in favor of the MSMD model.
Out-of-Sample Forecasting for MSMD(7) vs. ACD(1,1). BIC is an asymptotic
approximation of a Bayesian marginal data density, which in turn can be interpreted as
a measure of one-step-ahead predictive performance.19 We now conduct a pseudo-out-of18

For ease of interpretation and comparability to the maximized log likelihoods reported in Appendix C
and Figure 18, we multiply the BIC by -1/2, which converts it to BIC = ln L − k ln(n)/2; that is, maximized
log likelihood less a degrees-of-freedom penalty. Hence our BIC is in “log likelihood units,” so that “bigger
is better.”

sample forecasting experiment and directly compute RMSEs for one-step-ahead as well as
multi-step-ahead forecasts. Because our sample is large, we do not re-estimate the parameters
of the MSMD and the ACD model for each forecast origin. Instead we simply estimate the
models based on an initial sample d1:n0 and then keep the parameter estimates fixed for the
subsequent forecast origins i = n0 + 1, . . . , n. For more than half of the stocks we have more
than 11,000 inter-trade durations. In this case we choose n0 = 10, 0000. For all other stocks
we choose n0 such that n − n0 > 1, 000. Thus, the forecast evaluations are based on more
than 1,000 forecasts for all stocks. The shortest estimation sample consists of n0 = 1, 000
observations. Detailed information in n and n0 for each stock is provided in the Appendix.
Under the quadratic loss function implicit in the RMSE criterion, the best predictor
is the conditional mean. For the ACD model we simply iterate the expression for ϕi ,
which represents the expected duration, forward using (17). The forecasting procedure for
the MSMD model is slightly more complicated. Using our filter, we construct a posterior
(based on the information available at the forecast origin n∗ ) for the intensity components:
p(M1,n0 , . . . , Mk̄,n0 |θ̂, d1:n∗ ). We then use the transition matrices P(γ̂k ) to forecast the intensity components and compute the expected duration.
We summarize the results in Figure 19. The three panels show histograms of RMSE
differences (MSMD(7) - ACD(1,1)) at forecast horizons h = 1, h = 5, and h = 20. For each
horizon we are forecasting the duration dn∗ +h , which is the duration between trade n∗ + h − 1
and n∗ + h (as opposed to the duration between trade n∗ and n∗ + h). For Citigroup the
RMSE differentials are −0.02, −2.50, and −2.00, respectively. Across stocks, the one-stepahead forecasting performances of the MSMD and ACD models are comparable, and most of
the differentials are close to zero. However, for five-step-ahead and 20-step-ahead forecasting
the MSMD model dominates the ACD model for all 25 stocks. The forecasting gain from
using MSMD is huge. For instance, for Citigroup the RMSE reduction is about 50%, clearly
illustrating the benefits of MSMD’s more-accurate approximation to longer-run dynamics.

Summary and Concluding Remarks

The inter-trade duration is an important and natural measure of market liquidity, and its
variability is related to liquidity risk. In this paper, we proposed a new Markov-switching
multi-fractal (MSMD) model of inter-trade durations. MSMD is a parameter-driven longmemory model of conditional intensity dynamics, with the long memory driven by structural
markov-switching components. The popular standard ACD duration model neglects al+l of

those features. A few other notable duration models such as SCD have featured them in
isolation or in smaller assemblies, but none have featured them all. MSMD does so in a
simple and parsimonious fashion, successfully capturing the key features of financial market
inter-trade durations: long-memory dynamics and over-dispersed distributions. Both model
selection criteria and out-of-sample forecast comparisons strongly favor MSMD relative to
ACD. We leave it for future research to explore multivariate extensions and specifications
tailored to confront the massive trade counts observed in recent years.

Table 3: Descriptive Statistics, Twenty-Five Firms Randomly Selected From S&P
100. We show sample mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, over-dispersion (Std/Mean),
sample size n (number of inter-trade durations), and size of estimation sample for pseudo-out-of-sample
forecasting exercise (n0 ) for inter-trade durations between 10 AM and 4 PM during February 1993. We
order firms across rows alphabetically.
