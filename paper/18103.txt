Quality of Life, Firm Productivity, and the Value of Amenities across Canadian Cities

ABSTRACT
We present hedonic general-equilibrium estimates of quality-of-life and productivity differences across
Canada’s metropolitan areas. These are based off of the estimated willingness-to-pay of heterogeneous
households and firms to locate in various cities, which differ in their wage levels, housing costs, and
land values. Using 2006 Canadian Census data, our metropolitan quality-of-life estimates are somewhat
consistent with popular rankings, but find Canadians care more about climate and culture. Quality-of-life
is highest in Victoria for Anglophones, Montreal for Francophones, and Vancouver for Allophones,
and lowest in more remote cities. Toronto is Canada’s most productive city; Vancouver is the overall
most valuable city.

Introduction

Wage and cost-of-living levels vary significantly across Canadian cities and provinces, despite the fact that
capital and labor are largely mobile within Canada’s borders. Coulombe and Lee (1995) and Coulombe
(2000) find that income and price levels converged significantly between 1960 and 1980, but have converged
relatively little since then. These persistent differences in wages and prices are most naturally explained
by persistent differences in local advantages to households and firms, broadly termed as "amenities." To
clarify terminology, we say consumption amenities determine an area’s overall quality of life (QOL), while
production amenities determine an area’s overall productivity. The primary goal of this paper is to identify
the overall differences in quality-of-life and productivity levels across Canadian cities.
Some places in Canada have undeniable advantages over others. Most Canadians live south, close to the
United States border, where the climate is warmer and trading costs are lower than further north. Canadians
are acutely aware of regional disparities in natural resource wealth, from oil in Alberta, forests in British
Columbia, to depleted fish stocks in the Atlantic provinces. Much of the population is concentrated in a
handful of large cities, which benefit from sizable agglomeration economies and vast cultural opportunities,
but also suffer disproportionately from urban disamenities such as crime, pollution, and congestion. Strong
local and provincial governments, as well as differential treatment of regions by the federal government,
also lead to geographic differences in public services and taxation.
While some places appear more advantaged than others, much of the population is still located in less
advantaged areas. Although heterogeneity in household tastes and production technologies may help explain
this, the importance of heterogeneity should not be overstated: most individuals prefer temperatures above
-40, and most firms benefit from low transportation costs. Furthermore, many Canadians are quite mobile
over their lifetime and have only limited local attachments (e.g. Bernard et al. 2008).
In this setting, households and firms in areas with less advantageous amenities should be largely compensated by more advantageous local prices. Specifically, households in areas with lower QOL should be
compensated either through higher nominal wages or lower costs-of-living. Firms in less productive areas
should be compensated through either lower labor or non-labor costs. This is the essence of the methodology
of Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982), which has been used extensively by researchers to measure QOL and

1

productivity differences in the United States (e.g. Blomquist et al. 1988, Beeson and Eberts 1989; Gyourko
and Tracy 1991; Gabriel and Rosenthal 2004; Shapiro 2006; Chen and Rosenthal 2008).
Surprisingly, this popular methodology has never been applied to Canadian data. We explain this theory
in Section 2, using the framework by Albouy (2008a, 2009b), which realistically incorporates federal taxes
and produced non-tradable goods, such as housing, in a manner that Roback (1982) suggested, but never
implemented. In Section 3, we explain how we calibrate this model for Canada, and use the 2006 Census
microdata to estimate wage and housing-cost differences across Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs), so as
to infer QOL and productivity differences across CMAs.
Several issues arise in applying the Rosen-Roback framework to Canada. First, while most areas of
Canada are mainly English-speaking, areas such as Quebec, are predominantly French-speaking, while
areas such as New Brunswick, are largely bilingual. Different language groups naturally have preferences
for different areas, as most would prefer to live where their mother tongue is predominant. Roback (1988)
and Beeson (1991) estimate QOL advantages for different groups defined by education groups; we estimate
QOL for groups defined by mother tongue, a more pre-determined characteristic. We also discuss, for
what appears to be the first time, how the model may be aggregated across types, and be used to estimate
productivity differences across groups.
Second, unionization rates in Canada are still high relative to the United States, but vary across regions.
This means that some areas may have high real wage levels not because of low amenities, but because of
a strong union presence. We find it most plausible to assume that union wage premia do not reflect urban
productivity or QOL differences, and use wage estimates purged of unionization effects.
Third, federal and provincial governments play a large role in taxing income and redistributing it through
intergovernmental transfers. The role of taxes on residents is dealt with in the model using adjustments in
Albouy (2008a; 2009a). It is less clear how the model should accommodate intergovernmental transfers
and fiscal disparities due to natural resource wealth, documented in Albouy (2010). Thus, we exclude these
from the main analysis, and consider them in alternative results at the end.
According to our estimates in Section 4, the CMA with the highest QOL is Victoria, followed by the
BC CMAs of Vancouver, Kelowna, Abbotsford, and then Toronto, Calgary, and Montreal. The rankings for
different language groups are almost completely mutually consistent in CMAs with significant quantities of
each: Anglophones, Francophones, and Allophones all seem to prefer Montreal to Ottawa-Hull.
Our estimates of the productivity in tradeables, also the first of their kind for Canada, reveal Toronto to
2

be the most productive CMA, followed by Calgary, Oshawa, Vancouver, and Ottawa-Hull. While the QOL
of Anglophones in Montreal appears to be almost the same as in Toronto, their productivity is lower than
that of Anglophones in Kingston. This is consistent with the reasoning in Albouy (2008b) that, since 1970,
Anglophones fled Montreal more from a loss of jobs than a loss of amenities.
Under the assumption that there are no sizable differences in unobservable heterogeneity in the productivity of non-tradeables, we create aggregate measures of the value of urban amenities to households and
firms, i.e. QOL and productivity in tradeables. According to this metric, the most valuable CMA per hectare
is Vancouver, followed by Victoria, Toronto, Calgary, Kelowna, and Montreal.1
While QOL greatly interests policy-makers and the general population, published indicators of QOL for
Canadian cities consist broadly of weighted sums of arbitrarily chosen amenities, with ad hoc weights. Such
indices are found in Cities Ranked & Rated, Places Rated Almanac, and Mercer’s Quality-of-Living Reports.
These shed light into what cities people appreciate the most only to the extent that the ad-hoc weighting
schemes used in their calculations actually reflect peoples’ values. The willingness-to-pay methodology
implemented here instead makes use of data on local wages and housing costs to identify the aggregate
value of the different amenities. We show in Section 5 that our estimates are generally in line with the
popular rankings, but that households put more weight on climate and arts and culture. Finally, in Section
6 we consider how our estimates would be influenced by including intergovernmental transfers, alternative
price data from the CPI, or using housing-cost data from rental units alone.2

Theoretical Model of Spatial Equilibrium

Quality-of-life and productivity differences across cities are measured from wage and housing-cost differences across cities using the theoretical framework of Albouy (2008a, 2009a). This framework builds
upon that of Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982), but also accounts for non-labor income, housing production,
1

It should be noted that these rankings would change if interprovincial fiscal advantages were efficiently "equalized," as proposed
in Albouy (2010): in this case, cities in the Atlantic and Prairie provinces fall in value, while those in Ontario rise.
2
To our knowledge, the only attempt to measure QOL across Canadian cities in an economic framework, distantly related to
the one here, is Giannias (1998), who does so for 13 cities using 1981 data. This work measures QOL according to how housing
costs co-vary with six amenity measures, controlling for three housing characteristics, and assuming that incomes do not depend
on where households locate. This methodology depends on a highly parametric model with strict normality assumptions and a
linear housing price equation, which departs from more established log-linear specifications. Our model instead endogenizes wage
differences, controls for many worker and housing characteristics, is independent of any set of chosen amenities, and is illustrated
through graphs mapping the relationship of wage and housing-cost differences to QOL and productivity differences. Furthermore,
our analysis covers all 33 currently defined Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs), which we sometimes refer to as "cities," as well
as the non-metropolitan areas of Canada, organized by province or territory.

3

cost-of-living differences from non-housing sources, and inequalities in both federal and provincial taxation.
Furthermore, we account for multiple household types to allow for language groups, like Roback (1988) and
Beeson (1991), but in a richer setting that deals with issues of aggregation and productivity measurement.

2.1

Setup

The national economy contains many cities, indexed by j, which trade with each other and share several
types of mobile households, indexed by g 2 f1; ::; Gg. The population in city j is denoted as the vector
Nj = (N1j ; :::; NGj ). Each household consumes a numeraire traded good, x, and a group-specific non-traded
local good,3 yg , with local price, pjg , which varies by city and type. This accounts for the possibility that
households may consume housing in different neighborhoods or goods produced disproportionately by their
own type (e.g. Anglophones in Montreal live in certain neighborhoods and are more likely to consume
services produced by other Anglophones). In the empirical implementation of the model, the price of local
goods for type g is equated with the cost of housing paid by that type.4
Firms produce traded and local goods out of land, capital, and labor. Within a city, factors receive
the same payment in either sector. Land, L, within each city is homogenous and immobile, and is paid a
city-specific price rj ; each city’s land supply, Lj (r), may depend positively on rj , with a finite elasticity
"jL;r 2 [0:1).5 Capital, K, is costlessly mobile across cities, and is paid the price { everywhere: this
price may be set either nationally or internationally, although for simplicity net foreign asset holdings are
set to zero. Households of each type g, Ng , are perfectly mobile within the country, have identical tastes
and endowments, and each supplies a single unit of labor. Because households care about local prices and
j
QOL, wages, denoted by the vector wj = (wgj ; :::; wG
), may vary across cities. The national number of

worker-households is fixed at NT OT = (N1T OT ; :::; NGT OT ), so that the sum of populations across cities
P j
T OT . Households of each type own identical diversified portfolios of land and capital, which
jN = N

pay an income Rg from land and Ig from capital, regardless of the city they live in. Gross income, mjg
3

The productivity differences in non-traded goods may be quite variable. Without separate data on land values across cities, it
is nearly impossible to identify them. However, Albouy (2009b) shows that this does not bias the quality-of-life estimates, and has
only a minor bias on the trade-productivity estimates for reasonable calibrations.
4
As shown in Roback (1980), the use of a single traded good may be used to approximate the case of multiple goods. Factor-price
equalization, as in the Hecksher-Ohlin model of trade does not occur, because factors are mobile and many cities may specialize
in the production of fewer tradable goods than factors. Furthermore, non-housing goods may be considered to be a combination of
traded goods and non-housing local goods.
5
The assumption of homogenous land is used for simplicity, as we do not directly observe land values in any of our datasets.
As discussed in Albouy and Lue (2011), land values within CMAs may differ significantly because of local amenities as well as
transportation costs. Our estimates may be taken as an average of the value of land within a city. Our QOL estimates implicitly
include a penalty for areas with higher transportation costs.

Rg +Ig +wgj , varies across cities only as wages vary. Out of this income households pay a federal income tax
of (mg ), which is redistributed in lump-sum transfers by city, Tgj , which may vary by city. For expositional
ease, provincial taxes are discussed in the Appendix.
Cities differ in two types of attributes: quality of life, which raises household utility and is given by the
vector Qj = (Qj1 ; :::; QjG ), and productivity in the traded-good sector, which varies by factor and is given
by the vector Aj = (Aj1 ; :::; AjG ; AjL ; AjK ). These attributes, in turn, depend on a vector of amenities, Zj =
e Zj and Aj = A
e Zj .
(Z1j ; :::; Zkj ), natural or artificial, according to some unknown functions Qj = Q
e g =@Zk > 0; for a production amenity, e.g.
For a consumption amenity, e.g. safety or clement weather, @ Q
eg =@Zk > 0. It is possible that a single amenity affects both
navigable water or agglomeration economies, @ A
productivity and QOL.6

Household preferences are modeled by a utility function Ug (x; yg ; Qg ), that is quasi-concave over x
and yg , and increasing in Qg . The expenditure function for a worker of type g in city j is eg (pjg ; ug ; Qjg )
minx;y fx + pjg y : Ug (x; y; Qjg )
eg (pjg ; ug )

ug g. Qg is normalized so that eg (pjg ; ug ; Qjg ) = eg (pjg ; ug )=Qjg , where

eg (pjg ; ug ; 1), meaning that one-percent increase in Qg is equivalent to a one-percent increase

in disposable income. Since households are fully mobile, their utility must be the same across all the cities
that they inhabit. Thus, the after-tax income households earn in each city should equal the expenditure
needed to obtain the common level of utility, ug , given local prices and QOL:7
eg (pjg ; ug ; Qjg ) = mjg

6
It is worth noting that amenities may be endogenous to quantities in the model, and that this poses different problems when
measuring values by using comparative statics. For example, an increase in population, N j , may lead to greater pollution, lowering
Qj . If a city were to receive a theme-park, improving Q, this would raise N , raising pollution, and indirectly decreasing Q.
The value of the theme-park could be measured empirically by controlling for pollution, although the value when accounting for
pollution externalities should not control for pollution. Both direct and indirect effects of amenities have to be taken into account
when using comparative statics to determine the causal effect of an amenity on the attributes and prices in a city.

Measuring Quality of Life and Productivity

We begin by considering the case of where there is only one type of household, and continue with an
explanation of multiple types, showing under what assumptions we may aggregate results to reproduce the
single-type case.

2.2.1

Single Household Type

To analyze the effect of city attributes on prices we log-linearize the equilibrium conditions (1), (2), and (3)
around the national average. Thus, for any variable z, z^j = ln z j

ln z = z j

z =z, approximates the

percent difference in city j of z relative to the geometric average z, which is the value for a nationally representative city. Log-linearized versions of (1), (2), and (3) describe how prices co-vary with city attributes.

These equations are first-order approximations around a nationally-representative city and so the share val^ j , from how high the cost-ofues are national averages. Equation (4a) measures the QOL differential, Q

In practice, wage and local -good price differentials are observable and so QOL differentials are measurable directly from (4a). Land-rents are generally unobserved, making it difficult to measure productivity
directly from (4b). However, by assuming that local -good productivity is the same across cities, it is possible
to infer both land-rent and productivity differentials using only data on local -good costs and wages

The second equality, expressed in terms of observable variables, results from substituting in (4a) and (4b):
Collecting terms and using (5), and simplifying, we obtain that the total amenity differential, which expresses the social value of land, is equal to the differential value of private land rents, measured as a percent

It is worth noting that if tradable goods are heterogeneous, a higher level of demand for goods produced
disproportionately in city j may be conflated with a higher level of productivity. For instance, if the world
price for oil is particularly high, and workers in Calgary are concentrated in the oil industry, then the marginal
revenue product of workers in Calgary may be relatively high, even if their marginal physical product is not.
Thus A^j may be interpreted as a combination of both real and pecuniary effects.
Furthermore, cities could also vary in their productivity of local goods. As discussed in Albouy (2009b),
productivity in local goods cannot be identified without extensive data on land values, which is currently
unavailable in Canada. Under our other assumptions, lack of such identification does not affect our measures
^ j ; the lack does cause our measures of tradable-good productivity, A^j , to be slightly
of quality-of-life, Q
underestimated in cities where local-good productivity is high. Inferred land values both private, r^, and

8

social, ^ j , are more severely underestimated in such cities, but these are not central to our analysis.8

reflect the factors in proportion to how they are used locally, rather than nationally.
In Appendix A.1, we show that using this same assumption it is possible to estimate the land-rent
differential using equation (5) from aggregate wage and housing-cost differences, using the approximations

Thus we can have a feasible estimate of productivity

from (6) above that estimates the marginal productivity of land through residential housing. Furthermore, if
federal marginal tax rates for groups are the same, then the total value of amenities is still given by (7).
8

Higher productivity in non-tradables tends to lower wages and prices by a relatively small amount, and in the same proportion
that trade productivity raises them. More generally, the measure of productivity we use strongly reflects higher levels of tradable
productivity and, more weakly, lower levels of non-tradable productivity.

9

As households are perfectly mobile and each type has homogenous tastes, we should expect households
to sort across CMAs according to their tastes for local amenities. The centrifugal forces of household
preferences may be countered by centripetal forces in production, if different labor types are imperfectly
substitutable. In fact, when labor types are imperfect substitutes, the relative productivity of individual
types is not inferrable from wage and price information alone. Such inference also requires information
on relative factor usage in the traded sector. Using the labor-demand equations for the traded sector, it
is possible to show that the relative demand for labor depends on relative wages and relative productivity
levels:

is the elasticity of substitution between type-1 and type-2 labor.9 Intuitively, this (along with

fixed land supplies) produces downward sloping demand for particular labor types. For instance, one can
imagine that producers of tradable output in Montreal could find that having a few native English speakers to
be very productive for helping to export its products. However, because of provincial laws requiring the use
of French in the workplace, these workers would be less productive than comparable native-French speakers
if they were employed in equal proportion. Similarly, Allophones may have some idiosyncratic skills that
are imperfect substitutes for those possessed by other language groups, much as Ottaviano and Peri (2006)
found for immigrants relative to natives in the United States.

This formula implies that the greater the elasticity of substitution between the two labor types, the more
important wage differences are relative to employment differences in reflecting productivity differences.
When labor types are strong substitutes, wages must offset the productivity differences of different types: as

Empirical Implementation

To apply our model to Canada, we estimate city-specific wage and price differentials using Census microdata for the reference year 2005 and calibrate the cost, income, expenditure, and tax parameters from other
sources.10

3.1

Data and the Estimation of Wage and Housing-Cost Differentials

We estimate wage and housing-cost differentials using the 20 percent sample of Canadian Census data from
the 2006 Masterfile Microdata Files. Most of the differentials apply to a Census Metropolitan Area (CMA),
which consist of municipalities located around an urban core with a population of at least 100,000. The
remaining differentials are for non-CMA areas grouped by province. In total, there are 33 CMAs and 13
non-CMA areas.

3.1.1

Wage Differentials and Union Adjustments

The inter-urban wage differentials come from a sample of full-time workers, ages 25 to 55, and control
for observable skill differences across workers. Thus, for each language group, determined by the mother
tongue of the worker, we regress log wages on CMA-indicators (
the equation ln wij = Xwi

11 The estimated values of
+ "ij

and on extensive controls (Xwi ) in

j
w,

normalized to have a population-

weighted average of zero, are our estimates of the log-wage differentials, w
^gj . We interpret them as the
causal effect of city characteristics on a worker’s wage. Identifying these differentials requires that workers
do not sort across cities according to their unobserved skills.12 The overall differential for each city, w
^ j ; is
equal to the average of the w
^gj for each language group, weighted by the number of workers in each city.13
10
The reference year for the earnings is the 2005 calendar year. For housing costs, it is the monthly average over the past 12
months with the reference day of interview being May 16, 2006. For renters, it is the current monthly rent paid.
11
We include a quartic in potential work experience, highest level education (12 indicators), field of study (17 indicators), occupation (24 indicators), industry (15 indicators), immigrant status interacted with the visible minority status (except for Aboriginal
status), years since immigration, citizenship status and bilingualism interacted with mother tongue. These variables are all fully
interacted with gender. Appendix B provides greater detail on the covariates and regressions. The estimates of the coefficients of
the controls are available in an online appendix.
12
This assumption may not hold completely: Glaeser and Maré (2001) argue that up to one third of the urban-rural wage gap
could be due to selection, suggesting that at least two thirds of wage differentials are valid, although this issue deserves greater
investigation. At the same time, it is possible that the estimates could be too small, as some control variables, such as occupation
or industry, could depend on where the worker locates.
13
Note that in practice, some workers live and work in different CMAs. We determine the CMA of a worker by their place of
work, so that our productivity estimates are clearly characteristic of the city. The QOL estimates should on the whole be more
accurate, since they will represent the wages and costs faced by workers with relatively modest commutes. Regardless, the results
are almost identical if we assign wage differentials by place of residence, rather than place of work.

11

When controlling for location and additional controls, Allophones earn wages 19.7 percent lower than
Anglophones while Francophones earn 2.9 percent less.14 These differences within CMA’s could be due to
a variety of reasons, such as school quality or discrimination (Albouy 2008b).
As we document in Appendix Table A3, union coverage rates in Canada are high and differ substantially
across CMAs, with coverage rates varying from 23 percent in Calgary to almost 50 percent in Quebec,
Sherbrooke, and Thunder Bay. To the extent that wages reflect marginal productivity and unions raise them
beyond this competitive rate, it is appropriate to adjust them in order to estimate productivity levels. It is
theoretically ambiguous whether union wage premia should be discounted when estimating QOL. If union
jobs are readily accessible to new migrants, and these higher premia are reflected in higher rents and other
costs-of-living, then it would be inappropriate to discount the premia. However, if workers union wage
premia do not result in higher local costs-of-living, then it is sensible to discount them. Otherwise, real
incomes in highly unionized areas may be high relative to the local QOL, and QOL estimates in highly
unionized areas will be biased downwards.
Unfortunately the Census data does not contain information on union coverage. We were able to calculate CMA-level unionization rates from the Labour Force Survey, although these rates are not available
by mother tongue. We eliminate inferred union-wage premia by multiplying the union coverage rates by
a premium of 7.7 log points, taken from Fang and Verma (2002), and subtracting them from the original
estimates of w
^ j , renormalizing them to have a population-weighted average value of zero.
The importance of the public sector varies greatly by cities. For example, a little less than 40 percent
of workers are employed in the public sector in Ottawa compared to less than 15 percent in Toronto. Like
unionization, this potentially has an impact on wages. To control for this, we account for the percentage of
the workforce in each CMA that works in a public sector job.15
14

Although these differentials control for what official languages the worker speaks, the Census does not indicate how proficient
respondents are in their languages. It seems likely that self-reported bilingual Anglophones speak English better than self-reported
bilingual Francophones do, and vice versa.
15
We also imposed the restriction that w is constant across cities. In analyses that we do not report, we did find evidence that
there are some differences in the returns to characteristics across cities. For instance, university-educated workers receive less of a
premium for working in Vancouver than high-school-educated workers. This suggests that the former enjoy a higher quality-of-life
in Vancouver. While interesting, most of these return differences are relatively minor, and for the sake of simplicity, are left for
future work.

12

3.1.2

Housing-Cost Differentials

Following previous studies (e.g. Gabriel and Rosenthal 2004), we use both housing values and gross rents,
including utilities, to calculate housing-cost differentials. For owned units, we multiply housing values times
a discount rate of 7.85 percent (Peiser and Smith 1985), and add utility costs, to impute rents comparable
to gross rents. We regress the logarithm of these rents on flexible controls (Xwi ) in the equation ln pij =
Xpi

p

+

j
p

16 The coefficients
+ "ij

j
p,

normalized to have a population-weighted average of zero, are our

estimates of the housing-cost differentials, p^j . Proper identification of housing-cost differences requires that
average unobserved housing quality, and the extent of foreign investment, do not vary systematically across
cities.17
Controlling for CMA and additional controls, we find that Allophones have housing costs that are almost identical to Anglophones, while Francophones have housing costs that are 15 percent lower. The
lower housing costs of Francophones potentially reflect that Anglophones may live in more amenable areas
within CMAs, such in Montreal, where historic Anglophone neighborhoods are generally considered very
amenable. It may be that Anglophones face a more restricted housing market or enjoy better housing quality
that we cannot control for.

3.2

Calibration

The calibrated values for the parameters are similar to those for the United States found in Albouy (2009b),
except that we amend them for Canada to account for a smaller share of income received by labor, and a
smaller proportion of expenditures spent on locally-produced goods.

The controls, which are interacted with renter-status, include number of rooms (9 indicators), number of bedrooms (5 indicators), number of rooms interacted with number of bedrooms, number of rooms per household member, type of building (7
indicators), age of building (9 indicators), and state of repair (2 indicators). For owner-occupied units, we include an indicator
for condominium status and interact the controls with mortgage status. See Appendix B for more detail. The estimates of the
coefficients of the controls are available in an online appendix.
17
Unobserved housing quality differences should be minor, as Malpezzi et. al. (1998) determine that housing-cost indices
derived from the U.S. Census in this way perform as well or better than most other indices. As well, in the admittedly limited data
available, foreign investments in major Canadian housing markets appear to be small. For instance, Tal (2011) uses Landcor data,
a comprehensive database on historical sales and current information on the BC residential and commercial markets, to document
that only 2.6% of all sales over the past five years can be accounted by owners whose tax notice is sent to addresses outside of
Canada.

13

Information on income and expenditure share differences by language group is lacking, and so we assume
they are the same, which allows us to use equation (10) for our estimates.
The elasticity of substitution between different labor types is unknown. Ottaviano and Peri (2006)
estimate the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and non-immigrant workers to be about 6.5. It
would seem that the elasticity of substitution between workers of different language groups is much higher
than this elasticity, given that the workers were often born and raised in Canada, and thus have even more
similar skills.18 Thus, we use two potential values for : 1 and 40, where the latter illustrates the case of
imperfect substitutability.
Although federal tax differences are included in the analysis, federal transfer and spending differences
are not. There are three ways that these spending differences could manifest themselves. To the extent that
^ j ; to the extent that they benefit firms, they contribute to A^j ;
they benefit households, they contribute to Q
to the extent that they are wasted by governments, they show up nowhere. Since it is not theoretically clear
where they belong, they are reported separately in Section 6.1.
Calculated tax differentials depend on both federal and provincial tax rates. They include direct taxes on
income as well as indirect taxes on consumption: since this is a static model without an intertemporal savings
decision, the two are equivalent as taxes on consumption reduce the buying power of labor. We determine
provincial differentials using wage differences within province only. Across provinces, the average marginal
tax rate on labor income is 28 percent. See the Appendix for more details.19

Quality-of-Life and Productivity Estimates
Main Estimates

Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 report the estimated wage and housing-cost differentials by CMA or nonCMA areas of provinces. Figure 1 graphs these and provides intuition for how we infer overall QOL and
productivity differentials, reported in columns 4 and 5. The figure displays the average mobility condition
^ j = 0, and the combined average zero-profit conditions from (6), with A^j = 0. The
from (4a), with Q
average mobility condition illustrates the housing costs households are willing to pay, on average, for a given
18
We include immigrant controls to capture differences in immigrant/Canadian born earning outcomes. See the Appendix for
more detail.
19
Many workers report receiving little income other than labor income. However, given the static nature of the model, a worker’s
choices should be modeled to account for a worker’s permanent income, which includes a large non-labor component, particularly
if implicit rental earnings from one’s own home are included.

14

wage: any premium above that housing cost level is inferred to be payment for consumption amenities, and
^ j . The combined zero-profit condition
thus the vertical distance from that condition indicates overall QOL, Q
illustrates the rate at which land rents, inferred through housing costs, must fall, on average, as wages
rise: any premium over this is inferred to be payment for production amenities, and thus the vertical (or
horizontal) distance from that condition indicates overall firm productivity in the traded sector, A^j . Through
a change in the coordinate system, the two conditions in Figure 1 provide a set of axes for the new coordinate
system in Figure 2, which is in the space of productivity and QOL.
Interestingly, Canada’s five largest CMA’s – Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa-Hull, and Calgary,
all have above-average productivity and QOL, as they lie above the average mobility-condition, and to
the right of the average zero-profit condition. The smaller cities of Halifax, and Kelowna all have aboveaverage QOL but much lower productivity, which is commensurate with their reputations as charming tourist
destinations. Kitchener, Oshawa, and Windsor have less-than-average QOL, but are quite productive given
their size, although this is likely to do with their proximity to Toronto and Detroit. Also in this category are
the Territories, where high wages simultaneously reflect the high marginal productivity of the workers out
there, as well as the need for those workers to be compensated for the harsh climate and remote location.
Finally, a large number of smaller cities, including
Moncton, Regina, St. John’s, Thunder Bay, and Trois-Rivières fall in the category of cities with belowaverage productivity and QOL, with the compensating benefit of being affordable. All of the non-CMA
areas of provinces (except for BC) also fall in this category, suggesting that on average neither firms nor
households find less urban areas to be exceptionally attractive.
The rankings of the cities in terms of overall QOL, productivity, and combined value are given in Table 2.
Victoria has the highest QOL, followed by Vancouver, Kelowna, Abbotsford, and Toronto. Rounding out the
top ten are Calgary, Montreal, Sherbrooke, Ottawa-Hull, and Barrie. Saint John, Windsor, and Thunder Bay
take the bottom three spots. This list contrasts significantly with Giannias (1998), which places Edmonton
and Winnipeg in the top 4 of 13 cities, which here are ranked 17 and 24 out of 33.
From the second column of Table 2, we see that Toronto is the leader in productivity, which is not
surprising given that it is the largest city, and home of the financial center of Canada. Second is Calgary,
only the fifth largest CMA at that time, but with a strong oil and gas industry. Third, is Oshawa, as it is
50 kilometers from Toronto, with a strong base in automobile manufacturing. Vancouver and Ottawa-Hull
round out the top five. All of these cities pay a disproportionate share of federal taxes per capita, as seen in
15

column 7 of Table 1, as a result of being so productive. Despite being the second largest CMA in Canada,
Montreal is only in tenth place, possibly because of its language barrier with the rest of Canada and the
United States.
The land-rent and total-value differentials are reported in columns 6 and 8 in Table 1, with their difference caused by the tax differentials in column 7, and the ranking reported in column 3 of Table 2. Their
calculation is made visually transparent in Figures 1 and 2 through the average iso-rent and iso-value curves:
cities above these lines have above-average rents and total values, respectively. From these we see that Victoria has the highest private value of land, although Vancouver has the highest social value, as its higher
wage levels lead to greater positive tax externalities for other Canadians.

4.2

Estimates for Separate Language Groups

QOL measures broken down by mother tongue are presented in Table 3 for CMAs with at least 100,000
inhabitants with that mother tongue, and where they constitute at least 10 percent of the population. Calculating QOL measures for cities where a smaller number of individuals have a certain mother tongue raises
difficult econometric issues.20 On the whole, the QOL rankings for the different language groups are almost identical to those pooling everyone together. For instance, all of the groups prefer Montreal over
Ottawa-Hull. The only discrepancy is minor: unlike Anglophones, Allophones appear to view Hamilton
slightly more favorably than Ottawa-Hull, perhaps because they make up a larger fraction of the population.
Francophones do not seem to despise living in linguistically diverse CMAs, as Montreal and Ottawa-Hull
are their top two cities, while the worst two are Trois-Rivières and Chicoutimi-Jonquière. Allophones prefer
Canada’s three largest cities, Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, over all other ones, supporting the notion
that Allophones will prefer to live in areas with the greatest number of like-tongued speakers.
The individual productivity of different language groups is given in Table 4 for just a few cities where
the supply of each group is large enough to produce credible estimates. Panel A considers the productivity
differences between Francophones and Anglophones in Montreal and Ottawa-Hull. In Montreal, average
productivity is 3 percent above the national average, and Francophones are better paid and much more heavily employed than Anglophones. If both types of workers are perfect substitutes, then Francophones from
20

In places where a linguistic group is in a small minority, the calculated wage differentials tend to be relatively low and the
housing-cost differentials between language groups relatively high. This would seem to suggest that these groups find places
where the mother tongue are very amenable. See Warman (2007) for Canadian analysis and evidence of enclaves. It is likely that
these individuals have idiosyncratic attachments, such as spouses, that cause them to sacrifice real income in order to live in these
places.

16

Montreal are 4 percent more productive than the average Francophone, while Anglophones are 4 percent
less productive, making them about as productive as Anglophones in Kingston. If Anglophones provide
special skills that cannot be easily substituted for by Francophone labor, then the productivity differences
are even larger: with an elasticity of substitution of 40, an Anglophone worker in Montreal is only 10 percent less productive, comparable Anglophones in Saskatoon, and wages are as high as they are only because
Francophones cannot easily replace them. The results for Ottawa-Hull are much less extreme since their
national wage and employment differentials are roughly the same.
Panel B considers the productivity differences between Anglophones and Allophones in Toronto and
Vancouver. In both CMAs, Allophones earn less of a premium than Anglophones do, but are hired in a
greater proportion, relative to the national average. Thus, the less substitutable Allophone labor is for Anglophone labor, the closer their relative productivity differentials. It appears that Anglophones in Vancouver
have productivity levels just behind Calgary and ahead of Oshawa.

Relationship with Popular Rankings and Amenities

The press abounds with popular rankings of Canadian cities according to many characteristics aimed at
capturing "livability." Here, we compare our rankings based on revealed preference with the livability ratings
from Places Rated Almanac and Cities Ranked and Rated. The popular measures are not grounded in theory
and are largely ad-hoc, they reflect popular perceptions of what characteristics make cities “nice” to live in.
Unlike the rankings based on willingness-to-pay, the popular rankings also incorporate low cost-of-living
and good job-market opportunities as “amenities”. In the hedonic framework above, if these factors are
properly weighted, they should make all of the cities offer the same utility, making them equally "livable."
In practice, the popular rankings put less weight on cost-of-living and job-market opportunities than the
framework suggests.21
Table 5 reports the correlation coefficients between the rankings in these reports and the overall QOL
ranking shown in Table 1. The correlations are all strongly positive, with the correlation between the two
popular rankings being somewhat stronger than that between either popular ranking and the economic one.
These correlations are strong despite the fact that the popular rankings include offsetting cost-of-living and
job-market opportunities. The general consistency of the rankings seems to be mutually reinforcing to both
21
For instance, in Places Rated, cost-of-living and employment opportunities, are counted as 2 among 9 amenities, all of which
receive equal weight.

17

the economic and popular measures of QOL.
Table 6 estimates the relationship between the economic QOL estimates and various subindices given
to cities by Places Rated Almanac. The overall livability index in the Almanac puts equal weight on all of
the estimates. Hedonic estimates based on the economic measures of QOL indicate that only the indices
for climate and arts and culture have a significant relationship with households’ willingness-to-pay. This
holds true whether or not CMAs are weighted by population. With only 24 overlapping CMAs in the
sample, this test does have low power; indeed factors related to health, crime, and education may be very
important in households’ location decisions. But it appears unlikely that Places Rated was correct to assign
each sub-index the same coefficient: our economic QOL index suggests that the restriction that all of the
subindices should have equal coefficients is strongly rejected by the data. Understandably, Canadians care
tremendously about climate, and apparently quite a bit about arts and culture, or other amenities that are
correlated with those sub-indexes.

6

Additional Considerations

The model presented above has the advantage of requiring limited data, and of being intuitive to graph. Yet,
additional considerations should be examined which may affect the estimates, in particular with regards to
the role of non-housing costs, differences in non-tax federal fiscal benefits, and the use of rents instead of
housing prices. Given that it is not clear whether or not these considerations should be incorporated into the
estimation of QOL and productivity differentials, and given that they would also be based on incomplete
data, available only at the provincial level, they are presented separately in Table 7. The preceding results
are also summarized at the provincial and regional levels here.22

6.1

Intergovernmental Transfers

An adjustment for intergovernmental transfers and provincial source-based tax revenues is made in column
9. Recall that if these payments benefit households, they should be subtracted from QOL; if they benefit
firms, the should be subtracted from productivity: in either case they should be subtracted from the total
value. On the other hand, if these payments benefit neither households nor firms, than they should be
ignored altogether. Assuming that the payments do affect the total value in some form, they raise the value
22

CMA-level adjustments for QOL and total value, assuming that federal transfers are passed on directly to households, are
presented in Tables A1 and A2.

18

of Ontario and Quebec, while the Atlantic and the Prairie provinces are seen as less valuable. As analyzed
in greater detail in Albouy (2010), this is mainly driven by equalization payments, except for Alberta and
Saskatchewan, which receive large fiscal benefits by retaining the revenues from taxes on natural resources,
rather than sharing them federally.

6.2

Non-Housing Costs

According to intercity estimates of the Consumer Price Index, non-housing cost differences are not always
proportional to housing-cost differences, as we assumed above. If non-housing costs in an area are high relative to housing costs, then the cost-of-living measure approximated by housing costs is biased downwards
in that area. This causes QOL measures in areas with high non-housing costs to be biased downwards. This
may be the case in more remote areas of Canada, such as the Territories, where housing is relatively cheap,
but other goods are expensive because of transportation costs.23
Unfortunately, only one city per province has detailed CPI information. As a result, we need to assume
that provincial cost differences are reflected in the representative CMAs, typically each province’s largest.
These adjustments, in column 10, suggest that QOL and total values may be underestimated in the Atlantic
provinces, especially Newfoundland, and overestimated in Quebec.

6.3

Housing Rents

Our main analysis measures housing costs by combining actual rents with imputed rents for owner-occupied
units. There may be reason to doubt the accuracy of these imputed rent measures, especially during our time
period, as housing prices in some markets rose considerably up until 2006. We construct alternate measures
using only rented units, which we plot in Appendix Figure A1 against our main estimates of housing costs.
As seen in column 11 of Table 7, rents tend to differ less in value across provinces, although using these
measures has a fairly minor effect on the overall rankings.
We believe rent-only measures are less accurate than our main measures. Rental units tend to be more
centrally located than owned units, and hence less representative of the overall CMA, especially as the
23

Unfortunately, the intercity CPI estimates do not reliably measure housing costs as they rely on a subsample of new housing
generally built on the urban fringe. "The sample of builders for each metropolitan area is determined through the use of local
market intelligence and verified against relevant building permit data. Where possible, prices are collected from builders who
develop entire subdivisions, usually on large tracts of land." The Census sample is more reliable as it samples all housing. For
example in Vancouver, the CPI estimates that housing is only 10 percent over the national average, as opposed to 43 percent
according to the Census data.

19

majority of Canadians own their homes. In addition home-ownership rates are generally higher in larger
CMAs. Our main housing-cost measures are less prone to potential bias resulting from sample-selection
issues.

Conclusion

This paper presents the first hedonic estimates of QOL and local productivity differences for Canada, accounting for heterogeneity in mother tongues and unionization rates. These estimates are rather sensible and
intuitive, with the QOL measures exhibiting a strong positive correlation with popular rankings. We find
Victoria has the greatest quality of life, Toronto has the highest productivity, and Vancouver has the most
valuable combination of the two. Among cities that they jointly inhabit, Canada’s different language groups
appear to largely agree on what cities are more attractive, even when they live in different neighborhoods.
Local productivity is largely determined by size, but is also affected by other factors such as predominant
language, access to natural resources, and proximity to other large cities.
Overall, our estimates measure how valuable different Canadian cities are, not only in producing the
goods that households value, but also in delivering the amenities that households want. Most Canadians
seem to prefer the amenities of larger metropolitan areas and are willing to consume fewer goods in order to
live in them. Despite Canada’s enormous wealth in natural resources, the greatest resource Canadians seem
to value in production and consumption is each other.

So each type just needs to be weighted by their share of income when producing rent and productivity
estimates.

Factor-Specific Productivity Estimates

Factor-specific productivity differences do have first-order effects on quantities in the model. For example, in the case where partial elasticities of substitution across factors within sectors are equal, the relative

Provincial and Federal Taxes Combined

Individual provinces may not only have significant tax rates on income, but also significant wage differences
within them. This means that the tax differentials faced by households in different cities consist of two components: a federal component and a provincial component. Let the tax burden be given by two components,
a federal F and a provincial, P : (m) = F (m) + P (m). Assuming that federal revenues are distributed
evenly across the country, and provincial revenues are distributed even within the province, the federal tax
differential is

Data and Estimation

We use Canadian Census data from the 2006 Master Microdata Files to calculate wage and housing-cost
differentials. The wage differentials are calculated for workers ages 25 to 55, who report working at least 30
hours a week, 26 weeks a year. The CMA assigned to a worker is determined by their place of work. The
wage differential of an CMA is found by regressing log hourly wages on individual covariates and indicators
for a worker’s CMA, using the coefficients on these CMA indicators. The covariates consist of
12 indicators of educational attainment: no degree (default); high school degree; other trade; registered apprentice; college <1 years; college 1 to 2 years; college 2+ years; university certificate;
bachelors degree; above bachelor; degree in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or optometry;
masters; doctorate;
a quartic in potential experience (years of school are calculated using the 2001 Master Microdata Files
for the highest level of education);
17 indicators for major field of study: education (default); arts; humanities; social and behavioural
sciences; commerce; bio science; engineering and applied science; health; math and physical science;
other; natural resource; protect and transport; law; public administration; technologies; computers;
information sciences; transportation;
15 indicators of industry (2002 NAICS): agriculture (default); other primary; manufacturing; construction; transportation and storage; communication and utilities; wholesale trade; retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; business services; public administration federal; public administration other; education; health and social services; accommodations, food, and beverage services; other
services;
24 indicators of occupation (2006 NOC-S): senior management (default); other management; professional occupations in business and finance; financial, secretarial and administrative occupations;
clerical; sciences; professional health; assist health; social science, government service and religion;
teachers and professors; arts, recreation and sports; wholesale trade; retail trade; food; protective services; childcare/home support; sales and service occupations n.e.c.; contractors and supervisors in
trades/transportation; construction trades; other trades; transport/equipment; trades helpers; primary
industry; machine operators and assemblers in manufacturing including supervisors; laborer manufacturing;
An indicators for immigrant status, and controls for time since immigration and citizenship status;
5 indicators of minority status (Aboriginal, Black, Chinese, South Asian, and other) with the last 4
interacted with immigrant status;
Indicators for bilingualism interacted with mother tongue – French, English, or other – and for other
mother tongue interacted with speaking only French and only English;
All covariates are interacted with gender.

iii

We first run the regression of log wages on the individual covariates and CMA indicators using censusperson weights. From the regressions a predicted wage is calculated using individual characteristics alone
to form a new weight equal to the predicted wage times the census-person weight. The new weights (which
have only a small effect) are then used in a second regression, which regresses the residuals from the first
regression on mother tongue and CMA indicators. The coefficients on the CMA indicators are taken as
the overall wage effect. For the mother-tongue specific wage effects, the residuals from the first regression
are regressed on CMA indicators interacted with mother tongue indicators, using the coefficients on these
interactions.
Housing-cost differentials are calculated using the logarithm of housing costs, which are either reported
gross rents or imputed rents derived from housing values. The differential housing cost of a CMA is calculated in a manner similar to wages, except using a regression of rent on a set of covariates at the unit level.
The covariates for the adjusted differential are
9 indicators for the number of rooms (1 room (default), 2 rooms, ..., 10 or more rooms), 5 indicators
for the number of bedrooms (no bedrooms (default), 1 bedroom, ..., 5 or more bedrooms), number of
rooms interacted with number of bedrooms, and the number of rooms per household member;
7 indicators for the type of building: single-detached house (default); semi-detached or double house;
row house; apartment/flat in a duplex; apartment in a building that has five or more storeys; apartment
in a building that has fewer than five storeys; other single-attached house; movable dwelling;
9 indicators for when the building was built: built in 1920 or before (default); built during period
1921-1945; built during period 1946-1960; built during period 1961-1970; built during period 19711980; built during period 1981-1985; built during period 1986-1990; built during period 1991-1995;
built during period 1996-2000; built during period 2001-2006;
2 indicators for the condition of the dwelling: only regular maintenance (default); minor repairs;
major repairs;
an indicator for condominium status (owned units only).
All of the variables are interacted with indicators for rental status and among owner-occupied units, an
indicator for the presence of a mortgage. Housing-cost differentials are calculated to a series of regressions
similar to the ones above, with the mother tongue of the housing unit determined by the household head.
To calculate the marginal tax rates faced by a nationally representative agent in each of the provinces,
we first divide the total population into 17 income groups (from 1-10.000 to 250.000+). We then use Income
Statistics (Table 2A, Taxable Returns by Income Class) from Canada Revenue Agency Data to calculate the
share of the total population in each of the income groups. Subsequently, we obtain the marginal income
tax rate (federal plus provincial) that applies to each income group and each province, using the midpoint
of each income group as the income of the group. The marginal tax rates for year 2006 are obtained from
Walter Harder.
Non-housing cost data are taken from CANSIM and averaged over 2006. They cover the cities of
St. John’s, NL; Charlottetown-Summerside, PEI; Halifax, NS; Saint John, NB; Montreal, QC; Ottawa, ON;
Toronto, ON; Winnipeg, MB; Regina, SK; Edmonton, AB; and Vancouver, BC. Federal transfer differentials
are calculated using the total federal intergovernmental transfers data in 2005-2007 from CANSIM Table
384-0011. CMA level unionization rates are calculated using the 2005 Labour Force Survey Master File.
It is the proportion of unionized workers to the number of workers. The fraction of the employment in
each CMA that is accounted for by the public sector is also calculated using the 2005 Labour Force Survey
Master File.”

Wage and housing cost data are taken from the Census 2006 Masterfiles. Wage differentials are based on the average
logarithm of hourly wages for full-time workers ages 25 to 55, controlling for observable skills. Housing cost differentials
based on the average logarithm of rents and housing price, controlling for observable housing characteristics. Quality-of-life,
productivity, land rent, tax burden, and total value differentials are based off of formulas explained in Section 2.2.1 in the text
for the one household-type case. Fuller details on the data are in the Appendix
