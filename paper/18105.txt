Bankruptcy as Implicit Health Insurance
Neale Mahoney
NBER Working Paper No. 18105
May 2012
JEL No. H51,I13,K35
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the implicit health insurance households receive from the ability to declare bankruptcy.
Exploiting cross-state and within-state variation in asset exemption law, I show that uninsured households
with greater seizable assets make higher out-of-pocket medical payments, conditional on the amount
of care received. In turn, I find that households with greater wealth-at-risk are more likely to hold health
insurance. The implicit insurance from bankruptcy distorts the insurance coverage decision. Using
a microsimulation model, I calculate that the optimal Pigovian penalties are similar on average to the
penalties under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Introduction

A large literature evaluates the effects of government policy on health insurance coverage.1 The
question of why so many U.S. households are uninsured is less well understood.2 To better understand the insurance coverage decision, this paper examines a mechanism that has received
little attention but may be important to households on the margin of insurance choice: implicit
insurance from the ability to declare bankruptcy.
The implicit insurance from bankruptcy arises from the confluence of three factors. First, due
to federal law, hospitals are required to provide emergency treatment on credit—and in most cases
provide nonemergency care without an upfront payment as well. Second, under Chapter 7 of the
U.S. bankruptcy code, households can discharge medical debt, giving up assets above exemption
limits in return.3 Third, because of the deadweight cost of the bankruptcy process, households
and creditors have have incentives to reach negotiated agreements that avoid formal bankruptcy
filings.
Bankruptcy, as a result, provides households with a form of high-deductible health insurance.
Households are exposed to the financial risk from medical shocks up to the level of assets that
can be seized in bankruptcy and insured against financial risk above this level. This implicit
insurance affects the demand for health insurance. For households with lower levels of seizable
assets, bankruptcy insurance may crowd out conventional coverage. Health insurance is wealth
insurance, to a certain degree, and is less valuable to those with fewer assets.
The main objective of this paper is to assess the quantitative importance of this mechanism.
Hospitals have complex objective functions that may only place partial weight on profits. They
may choose to provide charity care even when unconstrained by the threat point of bankruptcy.
Households may view bankruptcy insurance as an incomplete source of coverage, better suited to
acute health shocks than ongoing chronic conditions. They may worry about other costs—such as
reduced access to the credit markets—from using this mechanism.

Gruber and Simon (2008) for a review of the take-up and crowd-out effects of public insurance expansions. See
Gruber (2005) for a review of the impact of tax subsidies on the employer provision of insurance. See Liu and Chollet
(2006) for a review of the effects of tax policy on insurance take-up in the nongroup market.
2 In a review of the literature Gruber (2008) concludes, “There are a variety of hypotheses for why so many individuals are uninsured, but no clear sense that this set of explanations can account for the 47 million individuals.”
3 The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) of 2005 was implemented after the
period I analyze. It prevents households with more than the state median income from filing under Chapter 7 in most
circumstances. The households most affected by the reform are unlikely to be on the margin of insurance choice.

I assess the economic significance of the implicit insurance from bankruptcy with two sets of
empirical analysis. First, I examine how out-of-pocket costs paid by the uninsured are affected
by the assets these households would give up in bankruptcy. Second, I examine how insurance
coverage is affected by a household’s seizable assets.
A number of unobserved factors make identifying the impact of bankruptcy an empirical challenge. I address these issues by isolating cross-state and within-state variation in the state-level
asset exemption laws that specify the type and level of assets that can be seized in bankruptcy.
These laws vary considerably. Kansas, for example, allows households to exempt an unlimited
amount of home equity and up to $40,000 in vehicle equity. Neighboring Nebraska allows households to keep no more than $12,500 in home equity or take a $5,000 wildcard exemption that can
be used for any type of asset.
I create simulated instrumental variables (Currie and Gruber, 1996) to isolate different types
of variation in these laws. I construct a cross-state instrument by calculating the mean level of
seizable assets for a constant, nationally representative sample of households as though they lived
in each state. This provides what Currie and Gruber (1996) call a “convenient parameterization” of
the generosity of each state’s asset exemption laws, purged of variation due to the characteristics
of each state’s actual residents.
I construct a within-state simulated instrument by partitioning the constant, nationally representative sample into demographic groups based on plausibly exogenous household characteristics.4 The mean level of seizable assets for each demographic group in each state captures
within-state heterogeneity in how asset exemption laws interact with cross-group variation in
wealth.5 When I include controls for demographic groups and state fixed effects, this instrument
isolates within-state variation in asset exemption law, addressing concerns that the results might
be driven by unobserved state-level factors. My preferred instrument combines both the crossstate and within-state variation in what I term a pooled simulated instrument.
Using these sources of variation and cost data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
4 These

groups are defined by the full interaction of age group, race, family structure, and education level.
states with the same average level of asset exemption generosity, states with relatively larger vehicle and
wildcard exemptions (and relatively smaller homestead exemptions) are more generous to demographic groups with
a larger share of wealth in these assets (and a lower share of home equity). In particular, the slope of the relationship
between wealth and seizable assets is steeper in states with relatively more generous vehicle and wildcard exemptions
(and relatively smaller homestead exemptions) as low-wealth demographic groups have a large share of assets in these
categories.
5 Among

(MEPS), I find that uninsured households with more seizable assets make greater out-of-pocket
medical payments, conditional on the amount of care received. My preferred estimate indicates
that a log-point increase in seizable assets raises out-of-pocket payments by 34 percent for households with higher levels of medical utilization (more than $5,000 in annual charges). Consistent
with the high-deductible nature of this insurance, I find no effect for households with lower levels
of utilization (less than $5,000 in annual charges) and no effect on the extensive margin (positive
charges).
Using the same sources of variation and data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID), I find that households with higher
levels of seizable assets are more likely to have health insurance. My preferred estimate indicates
that a log-point increase in seizable assets raises the probability of insurance coverage by 2.5 to 3.6
percentage points on a base of 77 percent.
The magnitude of the coverage effect is economically significant. The estimates indicate that
if the bankruptcy laws of the least debtor-friendly state of Delaware were applied nationally, approximately 8 percent of the uninsured would take up coverage. With a take-up semielasticity of
-0.09 (Congressional Budget Office, 2005), achieving the same increase would require a premium
subsidy of 21 percent.6
A natural question raised by the coverage result is how much households know about the
implicit insurance from bankruptcy. A growing literature suggests that local information flows
are important to the consumer bankruptcy decision (Gross and Souleles, 2002; Fay, Hurst and
White, 2002; Miller, 2011). Households may have general impressions about financial risk from
the news media or the experience of peers. I examine these perceptions with a web-based survey of
individuals on the margin of insurance choice. More than 50 percent of the sample knows someone
who has declared bankruptcy. I find that a log-point increase in seizable assets is associated with
a 0.10 standard deviation increase in an index of perceptions of financial risk.
I take the analysis a step further by examining the implications of this mechanism for health
insurance mandates. Bankruptcy insurance is inefficient because households do not face the full
social cost of being uninsured.7 Yet bankruptcy insurance may have the advantage of inducing
6 The Congressional Budget Office (2005) estimate is based on premium variation due to state-level community rating
and premium compression regulations. As I discuss below, this estimate is in the center of the range in the literature.
7 This is not a novel point. In discussing efficiency arguments for mandating that employers provide health insur-

3

less moral hazard than conventional health insurance coverage. This tradeoff suggests a system
of corrective “Pigovian penalties” that expose households to the full social cost of the implicit
insurance from bankruptcy.8
I quantify the welfare effects of different penalties by calibrating a utility-based, microsimulation model of insurance choice. The optimal Pigovian penalties average $343 and increase social
surplus by $66 to $131 per person. The penalties under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) average
$445 and increase surplus by $27 to $69 per person or 39 to 52 percent of the optimum. This shortfall is almost completely due to a negative correlation between the Pigovian and ACA penalties.
While the Pigovian penalties are decreasing in the level of seizable assets, due to means testing the
ACA penalties are increasing in this variable. Thus, there is a core tension between the progressive
case for means-tested penalties and the Pigovian argument for penalties that should be decreasing
in household wealth.
This paper is related to three strands of literature. By analyzing the interaction between implicit and conventional insurance, this paper is closely related to research by Brown and Finkelstein (2008) on long-term care insurance and the implicit insurance from spending down assets to
qualify for Medicare. It is related to research by Anderson (2012) on Medigap insurance and the
implicit insurance from the Medicaid Medically Needy Program. Like these papers, I find that implicit health insurance can cause substantial crowd-out. But studying health insurance mandates,
this paper complements recent work by Kolstad and Kowalski (2012). A key difference is that this
paper is concerned with evaluating the case for increased coverage, while Kolstad and Kowalski
(2012) focus on how to most efficiently increase coverage taking this goal as given. Finally, this
paper shares similarities with a literature that examines the effect of medical debt on bankruptcy
filings (Himmelstein et al., 2005; Dranove and Millenson, 2006; Gross and Notowidigdo, 2009).
Unlike those papers, this study treats bankruptcy as a negotiation threat-point, not a dependent
variable to be explained. In this, my approach more closely resembles the “informal bankruptcy”
viewpoint advanced by Dawsey and Ausubel (2004), who show that credit card debt is charged
off without a bankruptcy filing in the majority of cases.
ance, Summers (1989) cites the “externality that arises from society’s unwillingness or inability to deny care completely
to those in desperate need, even if they cannot pay.”
8 For this exercise, I assume that uninsured households are not already subsidized through the tax code or some
other channel.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the institutional background on
personal bankruptcy and medical care. Section 3 provides an overview of the data. Sections 4
discusses the identification strategy. The main empirical results are presented in Section 5. The
microsimulation model is presented in Section 7. Section 8 examines the welfare effects of health
insurance mandates. Section 9 discusses other implications of this implicit insurance. Section 10
concludes.

Institutional Background

The implicit insurance from bankruptcy arises from the combination of three institutional features:
the fact that most medical care is provided on credit even when repayment is unlikely, the ability
of households to discharge this debt in bankruptcy, and the incentive for households and creditors
to come to a negotiated solution to avoid the deadweight loss from a formal bankruptcy filing.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires that hospitals
treat patients with emergency medical conditions, and prohibits hospitals from delaying treatment
to inquire about insurance status or means of payment.9 As a matter of practice, most hospitals
provide nonemergency medical care on credit as well. Hospitals generally lack the infrastructure
to bill patients at the point of service (LeCuyer and Singhal, 2007) and rarely deny service when
repayment is unlikely.10
Having received medical care on credit, bankruptcy law allows households to write off this
debt in exchange for assets or future earnings. Chapter 7 is the most popular form of personal
bankruptcy, accounting for approximately 70 percent of all filings (White, 2007). Under Chapter
7, households can discharge most unsecured debt, such as credit card debt, installment loans, and
medical bills. In return, creditors can seize assets above exemption levels that vary by asset type
and state of residence.
Chapter 13 is the other bankruptcy option. Under Chapter 13, households discharge most
unsecured debt in exchange for payments out of disposable income over the following three to
9 U.S.C.

42 §1395dd.

10 In a survey of nonprofit hospitals, 90 percent reported never denying any medical services to patients with no insur-

ance (IRS, 2007). For-profit hospitals seem to operate similarly. For example, Duggan (2000) rejects the hypothesis that
for-profit hospitals have a lower preference for charity care. Delgado et al. (2010) find that the majority of emergency
departments offer preventative care to uninsured patients.

five years. By statute, these payments must be of at least the value that creditors would receive in
Chapter 7. They are rarely larger because, in the period I study, all households have the option to
file for Chapter 7.11 Following Fay, Hurst and White (2002), I use seizable assets under Chapter 7
to characterize payments under both chapters of the bankruptcy code.
Households, however, do not have to formally declare bankruptcy to receive the implicit insurance it provides. Under the threat point of bankruptcy, households and medical providers
often resolve payments without an actual bankruptcy filing. There are multiple junctures where
this occurs. Discounts on the list price of treatment—known as charity care—are offered at the
point of service to the obviously indigent.12 After treatment, many hospitals encourage financially
strapped households to negotiate discounts, requiring the submission of information on income
and assets (such as W-2s and mortgage payments) as part of their charity care applications.13 Even
when charity care is not provided, the lion’s share of medical debt is charged off in the collection
process. Despite contracting with debt collectors, providers recover only about 10 to 20 percent of
bills submitted to the uninsured (LeCuyer and Singhal, 2007).
Overall, bad debt from the uninsured was estimated at $16 billion to $18 billion in 2004
(LeCuyer and Singhal, 2007). While the exact proportion of debt discharged without a bankruptcy
filing is unknown, Himmelstein et al. (2009) find that the ratio of “medical” to “nonmedical”
bankruptcies, according to their definition, is the same for households with and without insurance coverage, suggesting that a large portion of the uninsured’s medical debt is charged off with
a formal bankruptcy. This is not unique to medical debt. Dawsey and Ausubel (2004) report that
the majority of credit card debt is charged off in what they call “informal bankruptcy”.
11 The

Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), effective in October 2005, established
a “means test” for Chapter 7. It restricted households earning more than the state median income from filing under
Chapter 7 in most circumstances. The households most affected by the reform are unlikely to be marginal to the
mechanism I analyze.
12 Federal and state laws also influence charity care provision. Nonprofits use charity care to meet their Community
Benefit requirement. Some states subsidize care to the indigent through unpaid care pools. I account for these factors
in the empirical analysis.
13 When this information is not provided, hospitals run credit checks on indebted patients, filing suit if they find
evidence of a mortgage or savings that could be claimed (“In Their Debt,” Baltimore Sun, December 12-24, 2008).

Data Overview

I use three main data sources for the empirical analysis. I examine the effect on costs using data
from the 1996 to 2005 waves of the MEPS. The survey has detailed information on medical costs
and insurance coverage. At the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) data center
in Rockvillle, Maryland, encrypted state identifiers and newly edited asset and debt variables are
also available.14
I examine the effect on coverage using the 1996 to 2005 SIPP and 1999 to 2005 waves of the
PSID.15 Both data sets have information on insurance coverage and wealth as well as publicly
available state identifiers.16
In all data sets, I aggregate the data to the household level and weight the observations by
family size for interpretation at the individual level. I inflation-adjust monetary variables to 2005
dollars using the CPI-U. I exclude from the baseline sample households that have one or more
members who are enrolled in public insurance or that have a head who is eligible for public Medicare insurance (i.e., age 65 or older).17 Due to the survey question reference periods, the MEPS and
PSID are most naturally analyzed at the annual level, while the SIPP is best analyzed by month.

3.1

Asset Exemptions

I codify assets exemptions using The New Bankruptcy: Will It Work For You?, a do-it-yourself guide
to personal bankruptcy (Elias, 2007). Table 1 shows these exemptions. Contemporaneous homestead exemptions exhibit substantial variation, ranging from zero in seven states to unlimited in
eight others; vehicle exemptions range from zero in 15 states to at least $10,000 in five others; and
wildcard exemptions, which can be applied to any asset, show a similar degree of variation. California residents can file under two different exemption systems, and residents of 14 other states
can file under the federal exemption system if they choose. The last column shows historical
homestead exemptions from 1920 (Goodman, 1993).
14 Bernard, Banthin and Encinosa (2009) find that the estimates of net worth in the MEPS are comparable to those in
the SIPP.
15 The first version of this paper used only the PSID. I replicated the analysis in the larger SIPP to increase the precision
of the estimates. The consistent results across both data sets increases my confidence in the findings.
16 I have examined the effect on coverage and found similar results using the restricted-access MEPS.
17 In the MEPS, I drop the 3.6 percent of households with missing wealth variables. In the SIPP, I drop the 0.9 percent
of observations where health insurance is imputed.

3.2

Seizable Assets

A key variable in the empirical analysis is seizable assets. This variable measures the net wealth
a household would give up if it were forced to declare bankruptcy at the time of the survey. Let
wi denote the vector of assets and debts for household i, and let e j denote the vector of exemption
laws in state j.18 Following Fay, Hurst and White (2002), seizable assets is given by assets that can
be seized in bankruptcy (gross seizable assets) minus debt that can be discharged in bankruptcy
(dischargeable debt) plus fees (filing cost):
wS (wi , e j ) = Gross_Seizable_Assets(wi , e j ) − Dischargeable_Debt(wi ) + Filing_Cost.

Gross seizable assets are calculated as the sum of assets above the exemption level in each statutorily defined asset category:19,20

Gross_Seizable_Assets(wi , e j ) = max


+ max Retirement_Assetsi − Retirement_Exemption j , 0

+ max Financial_Assetsi − Financial_Exemption j , 0
o
+ Other_Assetsi − Wildcard j , 0 .

Dischargeable debt is defined as unsecured debt. Filing costs, which include an estimate of legal
fees, are set to $2,000, as estimated by Elias (2007). Neither of these variables are affected by state of
residence. For households with multiple options (e.g., state or federal), I calculate seizable assets
under each option and assign households that one that minimizes their seizable assets.
Panel A of Table 2 shows summary statistics for seizable assets by insurance status in the
18 Households

with one adult are assigned the individual exemptions. Households with a married couple are assumed to file jointly and are assigned the joint filer exemptions, which are twice the individual exemptions in most
states.
19 Calculating seizable assets by asset types ignores potential gains from reallocating wealth into asset categories with
unused exemptions immediately before a bankruptcy filing. This seems appropriate since such reallocation is explicitly
prohibited under bankruptcy law and judges have broad discretion to root out this type of behavior (Elias, 2007).
20 Following the law, the formulation allows the wildcard exemption to be applied towards Other_Assets and assets
in excess of the exemption in the other asset categories.

SIPP.21 Seizable assets are right skewed with a median of $39,007 and a mean of $227,429. Gross
seizable assets average $234,147. Due to the large homestead exemptions in many states, seizable
home equity accounts for less than a quarter of this amount. Dischargeable debt levels are small,
averaging $8,967 per household.
Seizable assets diverge sharply by insurance status. Fifty-six percent of the uninsured would
give less than $5,000 in a bankruptcy filing, and 64 percent would give up less than $10,000. Fortynine percent of households with private insurance would give up more than $50,000, and 66 percent would give up at least $10,000. The threshold rule that household obtain health insurance
if and only if they have more than $10,000 in seizable assets explains two-thirds of the variation
in coverage. More details on the seizable assets calculations can be found in Online Appendix
Section A.

3.3

Medical Costs

Medical costs variables from the MEPS are shown in Panel B of Table 2. Annual medical charges,
defined as the list price of medical services used that year, average $7,113 per household. Total
payments, defined as the sum of payments received, are substantially less than charges. This is
due to discounts negotiated by insurance providers and charity care or bad debt. For the privately
insured, total payments average $4,819 per household. Ninety-four percent of these payments are
either out-of-pocket or made by private insurance providers. For the uninsured, total payments
average $1,475 per household. Fifty percent of these payments are out-of-pocket. Miscellaneous
payments, such as payments from charity care pools, workers’ compensation, or automobile insurance, account for most of the rest.

3.4

Insurance Coverage

Panel C of Table 2 shows insurance status in the baseline sample using SIPP data. Twenty-three
percent of the sample is uninsured, 72.1 percent has insurance through an employer or union, and
4.9 percent has individually purchased coverage. Given the low rate of individually purchased
coverage, I am unable to detect differential responses on this outcome.

are similar in the PSID and MEPS and are available from the author upon request.

3.5

Perceptions of Financial Risk

I conduct a survey to examine perceptions of the implicit and explicit ways in which the threatpoint of bankruptcy might limit the financial risk from being uninsured. The sample is designed
to target households that are more likely to be on the margin of insurance choice.22 The sample
is composed of single, childless adults age 27 to 49, screening out occupations with less than 10
percent uninsured in the March Supplement of the 2010 Current Population Survey. The survey
was conducted online on members of a commercial survey panel in September, 2011.23
The survey asks three main questions on financial risk and 22 questions on demographic and
financial characteristics to be used as covariates. (A complete copy of the survey is included as
Online Appendix Section D.) Table 3 shows that survey participants are most likely to be age 30 to
34 (31.5 percent), female (65.1 percent), white (80.0 percent), and college educated (63.8 percent).
One-third of participants are unemployed or not in the labor force; the median income is between
$10,000 and $25,000; the median wealth is between $0 and $10,000.24
The screening on occupation and demographics—combined with selection into the commercial panel—does a good job isolating individuals on the margin of insurance choice: Slightly more
than half (56.6 percent) of the sample has insurance coverage. And 52.5 percent know someone
who has declared personal bankruptcy.
The three main questions on financial risk are ordered in the manner that an uninsured individual might chronologically go through the negotiation process with a medical provider. While
the primary intention is to examine how responses to these questions covary with bankruptcy
laws, the novelty of the questions makes simple tabulations of separate interest.
The first question asks, Average medical costs for a broken leg are $12,000. Suppose you are uninsured, break your leg, and receive medical treatment at the nearest hospital. If you negotiate with the
hospital, how much do you think you would end up owing? Responses to this question are diverse,
with the sample split evenly between less than $4,000; between $4,000 and $8,000; and greater
than $8,000.
22 The

survey is thus not nationally representative, and results should not be extrapolated out of context.

24 Wealth is constructed by aggregating across car value and remaining loan payment, home value and remaining
mortgage payment, money in checking and savings account, and unsecured debt. Since survey responses are categorical (e.g., $2,000-$5,000), I assign each categorical response the central value in its bin.
23 I

10

The next question examines whether, and to what degree, hospitals are perceived as following
through on unpaid bills. It asks, Suppose you ignore the medical bills. Which of these outcomes do you
think is most likely? Approximately two-thirds of survey participants choose The hospital will send
a debt collector to come after your paycheck and/or property (e.g., car, home). Approximately one-third
select The debt collector will bother you for a while but then eventually give up. Less than 5 percent pick
You probably won’t hear from the hospital or debt collector at all.
The final question examines perceptions about bankruptcy law. Survey participants are asked,
Suppose you declare bankruptcy to get rid of the medical bills. Which one of these outcomes do you think
is most likely? The responses indicate that bankruptcy is viewed to be highly creditor-friendly.
Approximately half of the respondents choose You will have to fill out a bunch of paperwork and pay
a filing fee but you can keep your money and your property. One-quarter select You will have to give up
any money in your checking or savings account but can keep your property. And one-quarter choose You
will have to give up any money in your checking or savings account and your property (e.g., car, home).

Empirical Strategy

In this section, I discuss the empirical strategy I use to test the central predictions of the mechanism: that households with more seizable assets face increased financial risk if uninsured and are
more likely to hold conventional health insurance as a result. I start by presenting the second-stage
estimating equation; I then discuss identification issues and the instrumental variables strategy.

4.1

Second Stage

I estimate regression models of an outcome yi on seizable assets wijS and controls. Letting i indicate
households and j indicate states, the second-stage equation is
yi = αw ln wijS + Xij0 α X + eij ,

(1)

where Xij is a vector of household and state characteristics, and eij is the error term.25
25 I take the log of seizable assets because of the long right tail of this variable in the data. In the preferred specification,
I bottom-code seizable asset at the filing cost of $2,000 and include an indicator for bottom-coding as a control. I fail to
reject this functional form compared to more flexible alternatives. The qualitative findings are robust to bottom-coding
at other values and to a linear functional form.

11

I examine the effect on costs by regressing log annual out-of-pocket costs on log seizable assets
and controls for households and state characteristics.26 In some specifications, I also control for
medical utilization with a polynomial in annual charges. This is potentially important because
the sign of the unconditional effect of seizable assets on out-of-pocket payments is theoretically
ambiguous due to offsetting insurance and moral hazard effects.27,28 My primary analysis focuses
on the sample of uninsured households with positive medical utilization. I also examine whether
bankruptcy impacts the extensive margin of whether households receive care.
I examine the effect on coverage by regressing insurance coverage on log seizable assets and
controls for households and state factors.29 I use a probit functional form in the preferred specification for the standard reason that the dependent variable is limited to the unit interval. I show
that linear probability models produce similar estimates.30 I exclude households with publicly
provided insurance from the baseline sample as these households are less likely to make active
decisions about health insurance coverage; I include these households in robustness checks to
show that the estimates are not influenced by sample selection.

4.2

Identification Issues

Consistently estimating the parameters of interest poses four distinct identification problems. The
first issue is omitted variables: that the outcome and seizable assets may be jointly determined by
unobserved factors. For instance, in the second-stage coverage equation, unobserved risk preferences could generate positive bias if more risk-adverse households are more likely to accumulate
precautionary savings and purchase insurance. Unobserved health shocks could generate negative bias by depleting assets and increasing preferences for coverage.
26 I set the dependent variable to zero when out-of-pocket payments are zero. This is rarely the case. In the sample
analyzed, less than 4 percent of households make zero out-of-pocket payments.
27 To be more explicit, consider the effect of reducing a household’s level of seizable assets. Due to the mechanical
effect of the implicit insurance from bankruptcy, out-of-pocket payments should decrease. Due to moral hazard, households may increase their medical utilization, raising out-of-pocket costs and potentially offsetting the mechanical effect
in the opposite direction.
28 Controlling for charges raises its own problems if charges are endogenous to bankruptcy laws. The estimates are
very similar with and without this control.
29 I define insurance coverage by the percent of household member-months insured and an indicator for more than
50 percent of member-months covered depending upon the specification.
30 The case for the probit over the linear probability model is that it tends to produce more homogenous estimates
across instrumental variable specifications. This is because the local average treatment effect (LATE) from the linear
probability model naturally varies across instruments that isolate variation in subgroups with different baseline coverage levels.

12

The second concern is reverse causality: that households that choose bankruptcy insurance
have a strategic incentive to reduce their seizable assets to lessen their financial losses in the event
of a bankruptcy filing.
The third concern is measurement error: that because the measurement of assets is notoriously
difficult, the coefficient on seizable assets might be attenuated toward zero.
The fourth concern is endogenous asset exemption laws: that the state-level laws that specify
the type and amount of assets that can be seized in bankruptcy may be correlated with unobserved
state-level factors. For instance, a high-profile incident of medical bankruptcy covered in the local
press might both increase insurance take-up and provided a legislative impulse for higher asset
exemptions, biasing estimates of the effect on coverage toward zero.

4.3

Cross-State and Within-State Variation

I address these identification issues by constructing simulated instrumental variables (Currie and
Gruber, 1996) that isolate cross-state and within-state variation in seizable assets solely due to
legislative differences in asset exemption law.31
I construct a cross-state simulated instrument by taking a constant, nationally representative
sample of households (I use the entire sample) and calculating their mean level of seizable assets
as though they faced the asset exemption laws of each state. For state j, the instrument is given by

zj =

1
|I|

∑ ln wS (wi , e j ),

(2)

i∈ I

where wS (wi , e j ) is seizable assets for household i with wealth wi under assets exemption laws e j
in state j and I is the entire set of households in the data. This instrument provides what Currie
and Gruber (1996) call a “convenient parameterization” of the generosity of each state’s asset
exemption laws, purged of variation due to the characteristics of each state’s actual residents.
My preferred simulated instrument builds upon this cross-state instrument to additionally
capture within-state variation in asset exemption law. Among states with the same level of asset
31 There

is very little panel variation in these exemptions. As I discuss in more detail below, real exemption levels
have been remarkable stable over time since 1920. In particular, most of the changes since the Bankruptcy Reform Act
of 1978 have been small updates to account for inflation. I thank Richard Hynes for sharing data that allowed me to
examine this phenomenon.

exemption generosity on average, states with relatively larger vehicle and wildcard exemptions
(and relatively smaller homestead exemptions) are relative more generous to demographic groups
with a larger share of wealth in these assets (and a lower share of home equity). In particular, the
slope of the relationship between wealth and seizable assets is steeper in states with relatively
more generous vehicle and wildcard exemptions (and relatively smaller homestead exemptions)
since lower wealth demographic groups have a large share of assets in these categories.
To construct this pooled simulated instrument, I first divide the sample into k = 1 . . . K demographic groups based on plausibly exogenous household characteristics. In particular, I use the
full interaction of age group, race, education group, and family structure to define these groups.32
For each demographic group k and state j, the instrument is given by

z jk =

1
ln wS (wi , e j ) for k = 1 . . . K,
| Ik | i∑
∈I

(3)

k

where wS (wi , e j ) is defined as before and Ik is the entire set of households in demographic group
k. The instrument thus varies by state-by-demographic group. I include a set of dummy variables
for each demographic group k = 1 . . . K as controls in all specifications with this instrument to
partial out cross-group variation in seizable assets levels.
By capturing both cross-state and within-state variation, this pooled simulated instrument has
a number of advantages over the cross-state instrument introduced above. First, it increases firststage power by harnessing a greater amount of plausibly exogenous variation in seizable assets
across households. Second, by capturing a broader amount of variation, the instrument identifies
effects that are local to a larger share of the population and therefore closer to the parameter of
interest for broad-based counterfactuals. Third, the instrument allows me to estimate models that
isolate within-state variation in asset exemption law. This is achieved by adding state fixed effects
to specifications with the pooled simulated instrument.
32 Age groups are 18-24, 25-29, 30-34,. . . , 60-64; race is black and white; education groups are high school or less, some
college or college degree, and some graduate school or a graduate degree; and family structure is single, single parent,
childless couple, and couple with one or more children.

14

4.4

First Stage

The first-stage equation for household i that actually resides in state j is given by
ln wijS = β z z jk + Xij0 β X + Dk0 β k + µij ,

(4)

where z jk is the pooled instrument and Dk is a vector of dummy variable for demographic groups
1 . . . K. The cross-state first stage uses the cross-state instrument z j and does not require the
dummy variables.
Together these instruments allow me to isolate variation in seizable assets solely due to crossstate, within-state, or pooled variation in asset exemption law. The first three identification concerns (omitted variables, reverse causality, measurement error) are addressed by all of the instruments. Similar results with the cross-state and within-state instruments should alleviate concerns
about the exogeneity of the demographic groups used to construct the pooled simulated instrument. The within-state instrumental variables strategy addresses the fourth concern (unobserved
state-level factors) as the state fixed effects directly absorb any unobserved state-level variation
that might be correlated with asset exemption law and the outcome variable.

4.5

Legislative Origins

The legislative origins of state asset exemptions provides further support for the exogeneity of
the identifying variation. Homestead exemptions emerged over the second half of the nineteenth
century as the result of an idiosyncratic set of historical circumstances. Describing the key factors that led to the establishment of state homestead exemption levels, Goodman (1993) cites no
less diverse a list than “Texas colonizers and western developers, labor and land reformers, antimonopoly Jacksonian egalitarians, defenders of family security and women’s property rights,
Southern planters and yeomen devastated by the Civil War.”
Since then, states have added vehicle and wildcard exemptions to keep up with changes in
asset ownership. But, by and large, the real generosity of asset exemptions has been remarkably
stable. In his book Debt’s Dominion: A History of Bankruptcy Law in America, Skeel (2001) notes that
most of the changes in asset exemptions over the twentieth century have been inflation updates.

15

The downside of this stability is that it precludes an identification strategy that uses state-byyear difference-in-differences. Yet there is an upside as well. Because asset exemptions are largely
the result of historical idiosyncrasies, they are less likely to be correlated with contemporaneous
political or economic factors.
Appendix Figure A2 provides quantitative support for this argument. To assess the stability
of asset exemptions, I construct a historical analogue to the cross-state instrument: mean log seizable home equity under inflation-adjusted 1920 homestead exemptions for the nationally representative sample of households as though they lived in each state.33 Panel A plots the cross-state
instrument (y-axis) against its cross-state historical analogue (x-axis) for the 38 states that had
homestead exemptions in 1920. If asset exemptions grew proportionally, the slope of this relationship would be 1. The corresponding regression has a slope (standard error) of 1.18 (0.32) and is
not statistically distinguishable from 1. The R-squared is 0.43, with the New England states in the
lower right corner being the most prominent outliers.34
Panels B and C examine the relationship between contemporaneous asset exemptions and
contemporaneous political and economic factors. Panel B shows that there is no correlation between the cross-state simulated instrument and the share of the electorate that voted for John
Kerry in the 2004 presidential election; Panel C shows that the cross-state simulated instrument
and 2005 unemployment rate are similarly uncorrelated.35

Results
First Stage

I start by presenting estimates of the implied first stage. Table 4 shows estimates from ordinary
least squares (OLS) regressions of log seizable assets on the pooled, within-state, and cross-state
instrumental variables in the SIPP.36 Standard errors are clustered at the level of the instrument.37
33 An earlier draft of this paper showed estimates of the coverage effect using a simulated instrumented that isolated
this historical variation. The estimates are qualitatively similar.
34 A keyword search of newspaper articles in a six-month window around major changes in Massachusetts and Connecticut assets exemptions failed to reveal any information on the reasons for these increases.
35 I have also examined and found no correlation between asset exemptions and measures of firm size, household
income, racial composition, and wage garnishment levels.
36 First-stage estimates in the MEPS and PSID are similar and available from the author upon request.
37 Standard errors are clustered at the state level in specifications with the cross-state instrument and at the state-bydemographic group level in specifications with the pooled simulated instrument. While an argument can be made for

16

The first stage with the pooled instrument (column 1) is strong with an F-statistic of 300 on the
excluded instrument. The coefficient on the instrument is not statistically distinguishable from 1,
which is consistent with zero correlation between asset exemption law and wealth across states.38
The within-state and cross-state relationships (columns 2 and 3) are similarly powerful with Fstatistics of 186 and 349. Appendix Figure A1 visually depicts the cross-state first stage.

5.2

Effect on Costs

I next examine the effect of bankruptcy law on the financial risk faced by the uninsured. Panel A
of Figure 1 shows the relationship between payments (y-axis) and charges (x-axis) for households
with private insurance and the uninsured. Charges are the list price of medical care and should
be thought of as a proxy for the level of medical utilization.39 Payments are the sum of out-ofpocket payments and payments from private insurance providers. (Payments by the uninsured
are therefore simply out-of-pocket payments.) The plot was created by averaging payments and
charges at twentieths of the charge distribution.
Panel A shows that payments for the privately insured scale up proportionally with charges.
The slope is approximately 60 percent reflecting the “negotiated discount” that private insurers
obtain off list prices. For households without coverage, payments scale up at the same rate to
about $2,000 and then flatten out abruptly. Indeed, out-of-pocket payments made by the uninsured closely resemble those by an insured household with a high-deductible health plan.
Panel B examines how the relationship between out-of-pocket payments and charges varies
across uninsured households with lower (< $50,000) and higher (≥ $50,000) levels of seizable assets. The plot was created by averaging payments and charges at twentieths of the charge distribution. The figure shows that for lower levels of medical utilization, uninsured households make
very similar out-of-pocket payments. For higher levels of utilization, out-of-pocket payments
clustering the errors in all specifications at the state level, this in my view is a critique of the identifying assumption
rather than the level of clustering. If there is, for example, positive correlation in insurance coverage across demographic groups within a state, then the pooled instrumental variable will produce downward biased estimates of the
parameter of interest. A reader who is concerned about this possibility should therefore focus on the cross-state specifications that completely avoid this problem.
38 This should not necessarily be interpreted as evidence against a casual effect of asset exemption law on asset and
debt levels holding other factors equal. By simultaneously increasing interest rates (Gropp, Scholz and White, 1997)
and raising the incentive to hold assets, higher asset exemptions could generate offsetting supply and demand effects
that result in the zero net effect found here.
39 I will address issues related to the potential endogeneity of this variable below.

17

sharply diverge. Households with less seizable assets have their out-of-pocket payments truncated, while households with more seizable assets have their out-of-pocket payments continue
to increase with charges, albeit at a somewhat lower rate. The plot further supports the view of
bankruptcy as a form of high-deductible health insurance that predominantly impacts households
with higher levels of utilization.
Panels C to F of Figure 1 show the cross-state relationship between out-of-pocket payments (yaxis) and seizable assets (x-axis). To account for the high-deductible nature of this insurance, I split
the sample into households with more or less than $5,000 in annual medical charges.40 In these
samples, mean out-of-pocket payments are $1,268 and $149 respectively. The data is averaged by
state with circles proportional to the number of observations.
Panels C and D show the raw correlation between log out-of-pockets payments and log seizable assets averaged by state. For households with higher charges (Panel C), there is a robust
upward-sloping relationship, consistent with bankruptcy as a form of high-deductible health insurance. For household with lower charges (Panel D), the relationship is slightly downward sloping.
Panels E and F show the graphical analogue to a reduced form regression: log out-of-pocket
payments against the cross-state simulated instrument average by state. The reduced form paints
a similar picture. There is a strong upward sloping relationship for households with more than
$5,000 in annual charges (Panel E) and a slightly downward sloping relationship for households
with lower charges (Panel F).
Table 5 shows estimates of the effect on costs. Panels A and B show estimates from regressions
of log out-of-pocket costs on log seizable assets in the samples with more and less than $5,000 in
annual charges. Panel C examines extensive margin effects with linear probability model regressions of an indicator for positive charges on log seizable assets in the sample of all uninsured
households. Moving from left to right, the table shows OLS specifications (columns 1 and 2) and
two-stage least squares (2SLS) specifications (columns 3 to 8) that isolate the pooled, within-state,
and cross-state variation in asset exemption law. I control for charges in the even columns to account for potential moral hazard effects and exclude this control in the odd columns because of
the potential endogeneity of this variable.
40 The

plots and regressions are similar when I split the sample at $4,000 and $6,000.

18

Panel A provides evidence of an economically significant effect of seizable assets on out-ofpocket costs for households with more than $5,000 in annual charges. The preferred pooled IV estimates (columns 3 and 4) indicate that a log-point increase in seizable assets raises out-of-pocket
payments by 41 percent (exp(0.34) − 1) percent on a based of $1,268. The estimates are slightly
lower (23 percent = exp(0.21) − 1) in the OLS specifications and slightly higher in the specifications that use within-state variation (49 percent = exp(0.41) − 1). The estimates are virtually
identical with and without the charge controls. The cross-state estimates are very similar to the
preferred pooled IV estimates (38 percent = exp(0.32) − 1) but less precisely estimated.
Panel B provides evidence of a flat if not slightly downward-sloping relationship between
seizable assets and out-of-pocket payments for households with less than $5,000 in annual medical
charges. The preferred pooled IV estimates (columns 3 and 4) indicate that a log-point increase in
seizable assets reduces out-of-pocket payments by 5 to 15 percent (exp(0.05) − 1 to exp(0.14) − 1)
on a base of $149. The standard errors are too large to rule out a nonzero effect. But even with
greater precision, effects of this magnitude are unlikely to be economically significant given the
low base level of spending. The within-state and cross-state IV estimates are similar to the preferred pooled IV specification and also statistically indistinguishable from zero. I interpret the
positive OLS estimates as likely upward biased due to the potential correlation between unobserved household factors and the treatment and billing behavior of medical providers.
Panel C indicates that there is no effect on the extensive margin. Using the pooled IV estimate
(column 3), I can reject effects outside -1.6 to 0.8 percentage points on a base of 76.1 percent with a
95 percent confidence interval. The estimates are very similar across specifications.
Summary and Interpretation
To summarize, I find a strong positive relationship between seizable assets and out-of-pocket
payments for households with higher utilization, a slightly downwardly sloping relationship for
households with lower utilization, and zero effect on the extensive margin. Thus the impact of
bankruptcy on financial risk is exactly what you would expect from a high-deductible health
plan.41
41 There is reason to think that the effect for households with higher utilization might be an underestimate of the
long-run impact of bankruptcy insurance on exposure to financial risk. Medical providers sometimes allow households to make payments in multiple installments. The MEPS does a poor job capturing these payments as it only elicits
out-of-pocket payments for medical events that occurred in the approximately five-month look-back period. If house-

19

While not statistically significant, the negative point estimates for lower utilization households are consistent with a model in which medical providers partially offset the lower receipts
from higher charge households with more aggressive collections from households with lower
charges. For instance, Gruber and Rodriguez (2007), using rich financial processing data for a
group of physicians, provide evidence on cross-subsidization within the uninsured. In this context
the offset is far from complete. Combining the estimates for high and low utilization households,
the pooled IV estimates imply that a log-point increase in seizable assets raises out-of-pocket payments on net by between 21 and 24 percent.

5.3

Effect on Coverage

Having provided evidence that uninsured households with more seizable assets face greater financial risk, I now examine the crowd-out effects of this implicit insurance. Figure 2 presents
visual evidence, plotting insurance coverage (y-axis) against seizable assets (x-axis). Plots in the
left column use data from the SIPP; plots in the right column use data from the PSID. The top row
(Panels A and B) shows the raw data: insurance coverage against log seizable assets averaged by
state. The bottom row (Panels C and D) shows the analogue to a reduced form regression: insurance coverage against the cross-state simulated instrument averaged by state. The circles in each
plot are proportional to the number of observations.
The plots confirm the crowd-out prediction: insurance coverage is substantially higher for
households with more wealth at risk and lower for households with limited financial exposure.
The outliers are predominately states with relatively few observations.
Table 6 presents the main coverage estimates. Panel A shows estimates in the SIPP; Panel B
shows estimates in the PSID. Column 1 shows the marginal effect calculated at the mean from
a non-IV probit regression; column 2 adds state fixed effects to this specification. Columns 3 to
5 show marginal effects from IV probit regressions that use pooled, within-state, and cross-state
variation in asset exemption law. All specifications include demographic and state controls, year
fixed effects, and an indictor for the bottom-coding of seizable assets.42 Block bootstrap standard
holds with higher amounts of illiquid seizable assets (e.g., seizable home equity) are more likely to make installment
payments, then out-of-pocket payments in the data would underestimate financial risk for higher seizable assets households, making the estimated parameter a downward biased measure of the effect on bankruptcy insurance on long-run
exposure to financial risk.
42 The demographic controls are demographic-group dummies (fully interaction of age group, race, education group,

20

errors clustered at the level of the instrument are shown in all specifications.
The preferred pooled IV estimates (column 3) indicate that a log-point increase in seizable
assets raises insurance coverage by 2.5 to 3.6 percentage points on a base of 77 percent. Both
estimates are significantly different from zero at the 1 percent level. The within-state and crossstate estimates are very similar, ranging from 1.7 to 4.6 percentage points. The non-IV estimates
range from 1.8 to 2.3 percentage points.
Appendix Section B examines the sensitivity of the effect on coverage across a number of
dimensions. I show that the estimates are similar when I estimate the model using different sample
restrictions and when I control for potentially jointly determined covariates.
Summary and Interpretation
To summarize, I find that a log-point increase in seizable assets raises insurance coverage
by 2.5 to 3.6 percentage points, with similar estimates across a range of alternative identification
strategies and specifications. To put this magnitude context, I calculate how changes in asset
exemption law would impact insurance coverage. I stress that these counterfactuals are intended
for illustrative purposes only. Changing asset exemption laws could have broad consequences for
credit markets that are not examined in this paper. And as I discuss below, policies that increase
insurance coverage may not in all cases be welfare enhancing.
I conduct the counterfactuals of applying the exemption laws of the most and least debtorfriendly states to every state nationwide. Texas has the most debtor-friendly asset exemption
laws, allowing households to exempt the full value of their homestead and take a $60,000 wildcard exemption. If these laws were applied nationally, seizable assets levels would decline by
approximately 1.2 log points on average, and the preferred pooled IV estimate indicate that the
fraction of uninsured households would rise by 2.4 to 4.2 percentage points, or 10.6 to 18.5 percent.
Delaware has the least debtor-friendly laws, with no homestead exemption and a $500 wildcard exemption. Applying Delaware asset exemptions nationwide would increase seizable assets
by approximately 0.6 log points, and reduce the fraction of uninsured households by 1.7 to 1.9
and family structure) and a fourth-order polynomial in annual income. State controls are for individual market insurance regulations from Kowalski, Congdon and Showalter (2008) (count of mandated benefits and indicators for
any wiling pharmacist, any willing provider, community rating, and guaranteed issue regulations), hospital ownership structure (nonprofit share of beds, for-profit share of beds), Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments per
capita, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) per capita, and the presence of a charity care pool or fund.

21

percentage points, or 7.4 to 8.2 percent .
This is an economically significant magnitude. To see this, consider the premium subsidy
required to increase coverage by the same 1.7 to 1.9 percentage points. A central estimate of the
premium semielasticity of insurance take-up is -0.084 (Congressional Budget Office, 2005).43 Using
this estimate, inducing the same increase in coverage requires a premium subsidy of 20.3 to 22.5
percent.

5.4

Perceptions of Financial Risk

The cost and coverage results suggest a model where the ability to declare bankruptcy limits
household exposure to financial risk and in turn suppresses demand for conventional health insurance coverage. In the stylized model that I present below, households know their distribution
of health risk and level of seizable assets and use an expected utility framework to determine
whether to purchase health insurance.
Assuming that households know these distributions exactly is obviously an exaggeration.
What matters is that households have some knowledge of the financial risk from being uninsured.
For example, if households learn from the news media or peers that medical providers frequently
seize home equity, then homeowners may be more likely to purchase insurance coverage—even if
they know relatively little about the particularities of bankruptcy law in their states of residence.
I investigate this information channel more rigorously by conducting a survey on the financial
risk from being uninsured and examining how survey responses vary with asset exemption laws
across states. The survey sample is prescreened on occupation and demographics to be on the
margin of insurance choice. Slightly more than half (56.6 percent) of the sample has insurance
coverage, and 52.5 percent knows someone who has declared bankruptcy.
I ask the survey participants three main questions that are intended to elicit their perceptions
of financial risk. The questions are ordered in the manner that an uninsured individual might
go through the negotiation process with a medical provider. Paraphrasing considerably, the first
question is, What would an uninsured individual owe for a $12,000 medical bill? The second question
43 The Congressional Budget Office (2005) estimate is identified off premium variation due to state-level community
rating and premium compression regulations. The estimate is central to the small number of estimates in the literature.
It is smaller than the estimate of Gruber and Poterba (1994), who use the introduction of a tax subsidy for insurance
purchases by the self-employed and is larger than the estimate from Marquis and Long (1995). See Liu and Chollet
(2006) for a review of estimates in the literature.

22

is, What would happen if this bill was ignored? The third question is, What can be seized in a bankruptcy
filing? For each question, survey participants select from among responses that indicate different
levels of perceived financial risk. (See Section 3 for details.)
Figure 3 plots the responses to these questions (y-axis) against the cross-state simulated instrument (x-axis).44 Survey responses are ordered from the bottom to the top by increasing perception
of financial risk. The plots are created by averaging the data by the categorical y-axis variable.
Panel A shows that survey respondents perceive the uninsured will owe more in states with
higher levels of seizable assets. Panel B shows that hospitals are perceived to more aggressively
pursue unpaid bills in states where more assets can be seized. Panel C shows that survey respondents perceive that more assets can be seized in bankruptcy in states with higher levels of seizable
assets, although the relationship is more noisy than the two above.
Table 7 shows regression analogues to these plots. In columns 1 to 6, the dependent variable
is an indicator for increased financial risk, defined at the categorical level that most closely splits
the sample.45 Columns 7 and 8 show the effect on a standardized summary index that takes
a weighted average of the three outcomes, where the weights are given by the inverse of the
covariance matrix of the normalized outcome variables (Anderson, 2008). Odd columns show
bivariate regressions of the outcome variable on the simulated instrument; even columns include
controls for household demographic and financial factors. Standard errors in all specifications are
clustered by state.
The standardized summary index estimates (columns 7 and 8) show a robust, positive relationship between perceptions of financial risk and cross-state variation in bankruptcy law. A
log-point increase in seizable assets is associated with a 0.09 standard deviation increase in perceptions of financial risk. This magnitude seems reasonable. The preferred coverage estimates of
2.5 to 3.6 percentage points imply effects of 0.14 (=0.025/(0.773 × 0.227)) to 0.20 (=0.041/(0.770

× 0.230)) standard deviations. The effect is virtually unchanged with the inclusion of the demographic and financial controls and statistically significant at the 5 percent level in both specifications. The estimates for the three individual questions are all positive, although only the effect
44 Since

these questions are about a hypothetical individual, it is inappropriate to examine how these questions vary
with the survey respondents’ actual seizable assets. I find very similar effects when I control for financial characteristics
in the regression specifications.
45 The indicator is 1 if the response is greater than $6,000 owed for a broken leg, seize assets for what would happen
if ignore bills, and seize financial assets and property or seize financial assets for what is seized in a bankruptcy filing.

23

for the second question is statistically distinguishable from zero. The estimates are too similar to
permit an ordering of their relative importance.

Microsimulation Model

6.1

Model

To examine policy implications, I calibrate a microsimulation model of health insurance choice in
the presence of the implicit insurance from bankruptcy. The model has households and medical
providers. Households have a representative agent with expected utility preferences over wealth
w = wS + w E , where wS is seizable assets and w E is exempt assets.46 They face medical shocks
with list price m drawn from a distribution F with nonnegative support and choose whether to
purchase health insurance to protect against this financial risk. Medical providers are obligated
to provide medical services m and then attempt to recover the costs.47 I assume that household
wealth is common knowledge and that medical providers face a small (possibly nonpecuniary)
cost to pushing households into formal bankruptcy.48
Model timing proceeds as follows: (1) households decide whether to purchase health insurance, (2) households receive medical shock m, (3) medical providers submit bill s, and (4) households decide whether to declare bankruptcy. I solve the model in reverse order.
Conditional on receiving medical bill s, households can either not declare bankruptcy (yielding wealth w E + wS − s) or declare bankruptcy (yielding wealth w E ). Maximizing wealth, households declare bankruptcy if and only if s > wS .49 Conditional on a medical shock with list price
m, medical providers submit a bill s ≤ m to households. With a cost of pushing households into
bankruptcy, the optimal bill is given by s∗ = min{m, wS }, which is simply the cost m truncated at
the level of seizable assets wS .
The cap on financial risk affects insurance choice. To see this, consider a stylized health insurance contract with deductible m̄ and no other features. Under this contract, households are
46 I

discuss endogenizing wealth at the end of this section.
often outsource this function to debt collection companies.
48 In a previous version of the paper, I allowed medical providers to have only partial information on household
wealth and to face a proportional cost to recovering assets in bankruptcy. This model generated both formal (statutory)
and informal (negotiated) bankruptcy but otherwise similar predictions.
49 Fay, Hurst and White (2002) find empirical support for this strategic model of bankruptcy in contrast to a nonstrategic model where households file due to unanticipated adverse events.
47 Providers

exposed to medical costs up to deductible m̄ and insured above this level.50 Under bankruptcy,
households are exposed to medical costs up to their level of seizable assets wS and insured above
this amount. Thus conventional and bankruptcy insurance are very similar: The only difference
is that with conventional insurance the deductible is m̄ and with bankruptcy insurance the deductible is wS .
This simple model captures the main empirical findings. First, out-of-pocket payments are
increasing in seizable assets. This is driven by households with higher changes as the bankruptcy
deductible is more likely to bind. For households with lower changes, out-of-pocket payments are
unaffected as the variation in seizable assets is above this level. Second, holding wealth constant,
insurance coverage is increasing in seizable assets. Conventional and bankruptcy insurance are
substitutes so less generous bankruptcy insurance makes conventional insurance more valuable.
The coverage prediction is robust to natural extensions of the model. For example, allowing
insured households to receive more or better medical treatment (Doyle, 2005) increases the incentive to purchase coverage, but households with fewer seizable assets are still relatively less likely
to insure. Similarly, increasing the cost of bankruptcy to account for factors such as stigma (Gross
and Souleles, 2002) or reduced access to credit (Musto, 1999) does not affect the basic prediction.
Endogenizing the level of seizable assets actually strengthens the relationship because households
that choose to forgo coverage have an additional incentive to reduce their seizable assets.

6.2

Simulation

I simulate the model by separately calculating the willingness to pay (WTP) and premium for
a conventional health insurance plan for each household in a nationally representative sample.
Households purchase insurance if and only if their WTP is greater than the premium.51 I use the
sample of households in the 2005 PSID and continue to exclude households with public insurance
or a member age 65 or older.
For a given household, WTP for conventional insurance with deductible m̄ is the value v that
50 In

practice, health insurers negotiate discounts off medical charges. However, as shown in Panel A of Figure 1,
uninsured households seem to receive these discounts as well. To account for discounts in the model, one could replace
m with discounted costs with no impact on the predictions.
51 Implicit in this formulation is the assumption that households with employer-sponsored insurance pay for this
coverage with a wage offset. Summarizing the empirical literature, Gruber (2000) concludes that the costs of healthcare
are fully shifted to wages on average, justifying this approach.

25

equates that household’s expected utility with conventional insurance to its expected utility with
the implicit insurance from bankruptcy:

Em u w − v − min{m, m̄} = Em u w − min{m, wS } .

(5)

I assume that each household is represented by a single member with constant relative riskaversion (CARA) utility.52 I show results with risk aversion parameters of α = 2.5 × 10−5 (low
risk aversion), α = 5.0 × 10−5 (moderate risk aversion), and α = 7.5 × 10−4 (high risk aversion).
Multiplying by the median wealth level of $40,318, these parameters can be interpreted as relative
risk coefficients of γ = 1, 2, and 3.
I construct household-level medical cost distributions by integrating over individual-level
medical cost distributions for cells defined by the full interaction of age group, sex, and insurance
status in the 2005 MEPS. To calculate counterfactual cost distributions that insured households
would face without coverage, I deflate the empirical cost distributions by a moral hazard factor
of 1.25, the change in utilization found in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (Finkelstein
et al., 2011). I inflate costs for the uninsured by the same factor.
These changes in medical utilization also have a direct effect on household utility. I approximate the consumption value of changes in utilization by assuming that health insurance decreases
the price of medical care from 1 to 0 on the margin and that households have linear demand between these points.53 These assumptions imply that the consumption value of changes in utilization is simply the triangle under the demand curve or 0.5 of the change in expenditure.54 The WTP
for conventional insurance is calculated with 0.5 of the increase in utilization added to wealth inside the utility function.
Premiums are based on expected costs above the deductible and are also allowed to vary at
the household level according to the household-specific medical cost distributions. To account
for administrative costs, I scale up these costs by the factor λ = 1.1.55,56 For a given deductible,
52 Using a CARA specification avoids the problems associated with nonpositive wealth. Calibrations with CRRA
utility and a consumption floor generate stronger results.
53 A log-log demand curve does not seem appropriate since I want to model demand when the marginal price is zero.
54 Consumer surplus with linear demand is given by ∆CS = 1 ∆p · ∆q. Since ∆p = 1, ∆CS = 1 ∆q.

argument, the increase in coverage will reduce cross-subsidization from the insured, lowering insurance premiums

Health Insurance Mandates

I use the microsimulation model to examine the implications of this mechanism for health insurance mandates. From a policy design perspective, bankruptcy insurance has a number of potential
drawbacks: It may force the uninsured to receive care in emergency rooms, which may not be the
most appropriate setting (Delgado et al., 2010); it may result in too little preventative care, inflating overall costs (Institute of Medicine, 2002); there are transaction costs to negotiation under the
threat point of bankruptcy and externalities to formal bankruptcy when it occurs. For this exercise, however, I focus on a single problem: Because households do not face the full social cost of
being uninsured, too many choose to be uninsured on the margin.57
Conventional health insurance has well-documented inefficiencies as well. Relative to bankruptcy,
moral hazard is particularly relevant.58 With conventional health insurance, physicians and patients have incentives to supply and demand excess medical care. With bankruptcy insurance,
physicians are motivated by their professional ethics and the threat of lawsuits, but may have
greater exposure to the social cost of their decisions. And patients have less leverage to demand
excess treatment. Thus, some households may optimally choose to rely on bankruptcy even if
exposed to a Pigovian penalty for the expected social cost of using this mechanism.
and thereby further raising insurance coverage. Empirically, the results from Section 5 suggest that the costs of unpaid
care to a first approximation are equally borne by insured and uninsured households and therefore do not generate
this positive feedback loop. In the preferred pooled IV specifications, the uninsured cross-subsidize between 8 and 23
percent of the cost of the implicit insurance from bankruptcy with higher out-of-pocket payments when they have lower
charges. Since the uninsured are about 15 percent of the population, it seems reasonable to assume that a reduction in
unpaid care will be equally incident on insured and uninsured households and therefore not generate the hypothesized
general equilibrium response.
57 I assume that insurance is not already subsidized through the tax code or some other channel.
58 Empirically, adverse selection does not seem to affect insurance choice on the extensive margin (Cutler and Zeckhauser, 2000; Cardon and Hendel, 2001).

27

Table 8 shows the welfare effects of the optimal Pigovian and ACA penalties. For each penalty
system, I allow households to choose between conventional insurance at the simulated premiums
and bankruptcy insurance at the cost of the penalty. I show results when the model is calibrated
to low, moderate, and high levels of risk aversion which generate baseline coverage rates of 65,
81, and 90 percent. Actual insurance coverage is 77 percent in the sample. The results are shown
relative to a baseline in which households can choose bankruptcy at no cost.
Panel A shows coverage and welfare under the optimal Pigovian penalties, defined as expected costs for each household in excess of their level of seizable assets. The optimal penalties
average $343 per person but vary broadly with seizable assets. Across risk-aversion levels, the
penalties induce more than 90 percent of the uninsured to take up coverage. As indicated by the
higher willingness to pay and higher costs, these households purchase more generous coverage
than they had from bankruptcy. The net effect is an increase in surplus of $66 to $131 per person.59
Panel B shows the welfare effects of the ACA penalties. When fully implemented in 2016,
these penalties will equal the greater of $625 or 2.5 percent of income per household, up to a
maximum of $2,085. Under these penalties, deflated to 2005 levels assuming trend inflation, takeup ranges from 34 to 51 percent. Willingness to pay and costs rise by less than under the optimal
penalties. The net effect is a increase in surplus of $27 to $69 per person or 39 to 52 percent of the
optimum.
This shortfall is almost completely due the correlation between the ACA and optimal penalties. Equating the mean level of the ACA and optimal penalties has virtually no effect on net
surplus. Because the ACA penalties are increasing in income while the optimal penalties are decreasing in seizable assets, the ACA and optimal penalties are negatively correlated (ρ = −0.34).
When it comes to mandates, progressivity and Pigovian efficiency directly conflict.

Discussion

The main focus of this paper is to examine how the implicit insurance from bankruptcy affects
out-of-pocket payments and the level of insurance coverage. Given the large number of uninsured
and the vigorous debate over policies to increase coverage, this seems like the primary question
59 The

effects are nonmonotonic with risk aversion because this parameter affects both the baseline coverage rate and
the responsiveness of households to the penalty.

28

of interest. However, the implicit insurance from bankruptcy has a number of more nuanced
implications. I briefly discuss some of them below.
High-Deductible Health Plans
High-deductible health plans (HDHP) were intended by their proponents to expand insurance coverage.60 The idea was that by offering low premiums, these plans would be expand coverage among the young and healthy who are more likely to be uninsured. Yet despite a concerted
effort by policymakers and insurance companies, they have not been successful in this regard
(Fronstin and Collins, 2008). The implicit insurance from bankruptcy is an appealing explanation
for this failure. Because more than half the uninsured have less than $5,000 in seizable assets,
HDHPs are the type of health plan that is most crowded out by this mechanism.
“Mini-Med” Plans
A related issue is the popularity of “mini-med” plans. These are plans with annual caps on
coverage of a few thousand dollars and low monthly fees. For example, McDonald’s “McCrew
Care” in Montana provides its employees up to $2,000 in annual benefits for $56 per month.61
Many have questioned whether these plans are actually “insurance” since they provide essentially
no coverage for large health shocks. Yet if mini-med plan enrollees have few seizable assets,
this is exactly the insurance theory implies they should demand as it fills in the gap below the
“deductible” of the implicit insurance from bankruptcy.
The Insurance Generosity Gap
In his review of the literature, Gruber (2008) asks why most U.S. households appear to be
underinsured or overinsured but are rarely in between. Implicit insurance from bankruptcy can
explain this finding. Without bankruptcy, households face a standard continuous tradeoff between insurance generosity and other goods. Implicit insurance generates a notch: Households
receive some implicit insurance without giving up other goods. Convex preferences give rise to
an insurance generosity gap, with households sorting into more-generous conventional health insurance and less-generous implicit insurance from bankruptcy. Bankruptcy insurance can explain
60 In

2005, qualifying HDHP were required to have deductibles of between $2,000 to $5,250 for a family and between
$1,000 and $2,650 for an individual.

why there are many households with first-dollar or no coverage, and few households with $10,000
deductible plans.
Rising Risk, Falling Coverage
Chernew, Cutler and Keenan (2005) show that more than half the decrease in insurance coverage during the 1990s can be explained by rising premiums. Yet as the authors explain, from
the standpoint of economic theory, this is counterintuitive. With standard risk preferences, rising costs should lead to increased coverage. Taking bankruptcy into account, however, reverses
this intuition. The decrease in coverage can be explained by households substituting away from
conventional health insurance and choosing bankruptcy insurance that is increasing in actuarial
value without increasing in price.

Conclusion

Understanding why households are uninsured is fundamental to positive and normative analysis of health insurance policy—yet the insurance-coverage decision is not well understood. The
objective of this paper is to examine how the implicit insurance from bankruptcy bears on this
decision.
In the first part of the paper, I argue that the fact that most medical care is provided on credit
coupled with the fact that this debt can be discharged for seizable assets in bankruptcy provides
households with implicit high-deducible health insurance.
I next evaluated the quantitative importance of this mechanism. Exploiting cross-state and
within-state variation in asset exemption law, I show that uninsured households with greater
seizable assets make higher out-of-pocket medical payments, conditional on the amount of care
received. In turn, I find that households with greater wealth-at-risk are more likely to hold health
insurance coverage. Health insurance is wealth insurance, to a certain degree, and is less valuable
to those with fewer assets.
The final part of the paper examined ways in which the implicit insurance from bankruptcy
might inform the design of health insurance policy. Because households do not pay for bankruptcy
insurance, too many households choose to be uninsured on the margin. Using a utility-based,

30

microsimulation model of insurance choice, I estimate that the optimal Pigovian penalties are
similar on average to the penalties under the ACA.

Notes: Plots show survey responses on the perceptions of financial risk from being uninsured (y-axis)
against the cross-state simulated instrument (x-axis). Larger y-axis values are indicative of ordinally
greater financial risk. Panel A shows responses to the question: Average medical costs for a broken leg are
$12,000. Suppose you are uninsured, break your leg, and receive medical treatment at the nearest hospital. If you
negotiate with the hospital, how much do you think you would end up owing? Panel B shows responses to the
question: Suppose you ignore the medical bills. Which of these outcomes do you think is most likely? Answers to
this question are ranked in severity from (a) you probably won’t hear from the hospital or debt collector at all to
(b) the debt collector will bother you for a while but then eventually give up to (c) the hospital will send a debt
collector to come after your paycheck and/or property (e.g., car, home). Panel C shows responses to the question:
Suppose you declare bankruptcy to get rid of the medical bills. Which one of these outcomes do you think is most
likely? Responses are ordered in severity from (a) you will have to fill out a bunch of paperwork and pay a filing
fee but you can keep your money and your property to (b) you will have to give up any money in your checking or
savings account but can keep your property to (c) you will have to give up any money in your checking or savings
account and your property (e.g., car, home). The cross-state simulated instrument is mean log seizable assets
for a constant, nationally representative sample of households as though they lived in each state. The
points are constructed by averaging the data by the categorical y-axis variables. The survey was
conducted in September, 2011 on a web-based commercial panel of single, childless adults age 27 to 49,
screening out occupations with less than 10 percent uninsured in the March Supplement to the 2010
Current Population Survey. N = 800.

Notes: Contemporaneous exemptions for couples filing jointly from Elias (2007) and historical exemptions
for couples filing jointly from Goodman (1993). Under contemporaneous law, California residents can
choose between system 1 and 2 and residents can choose federal exemptions in states where federal
exemptions are available. Wildcard no-homestead exemption is available to households which do not take
the homestead exemption. For the historical exemptions, states that did not exist and states that had
acre-based exemptions are denoted as n/a. States that did not have homestead exemptions are assigned a
value of zero.
*Excludes states with unlimited or n/a exemptions.

Notes: Household-level statistics. Seizable assets and insurance coverage are calculated using the
1996-2005 SIPP. See text for details. Medical costs are annual statistics from the 1996-2005 MEPS. Charges
are the list price of medical care received, total payments are the sum of payments made for this care, and
out-of-pocket payments are the payments made by households. Both samples exclude households with
public insurance or a member age 65 or older. Values are inflation-adjusted to 2005 dollars using the
CPI-U.

Notes: Panel A shows estimates from regressions of log out-of-pocket payments on log seizable assets in the sample of households with at least
$5,000 in annual charges. Panel B shows estimates of the same regression in the sample of households with charges between $0 and $5,000
non-inclusive. Panel C shows estimates from regressions of an indicator for nonzero charges on log seizable assets in the sample of uninsured
households. The cross-state simulated instrument is mean log seizable assets for a constant, nationally representative sample of households as
though they lived in each state. The within-state simulated instrument is similarly constructed by plausibly exogenous demographic group, where
groups are defined by the full interaction of age group, race, education group, and family structure. Demographic controls are demographic-group
dummies and a fourth-order polynomial in annual income. Charge polynomial is fourth order as well. All specifications include an indicator for
the bottom-coding of seizable assets. Samples sizes are 431, 2002, and 3201 across the three panels. Pooled 1996-2005 MEPS, excluding households
with insurance or a member age 65 or older, inflation-adjusted to 2005 using the CPI-U. Robust standard errors clustered by state in parentheses.

Notes: Table shows marginal effects calculated at the mean of a log point increase in seizable assets on insurance coverage from non-IV and IV
probit regressions. The cross-state simulated instrument is mean log seizable assets for a constant, nationally representative sample of households
as though they lived in each state. The within-state simulated instrument is similarly constructed by plausibly exogenous demographic group,
where groups are defined by the full interaction of age group, race, education group, and family structure. Demographic controls are
demographic-group dummies and a fourth-order polynomial in annual income. State controls are for individual market insurance regulations (see
text for details), hospital ownership structure, DSH payments and FQHC per capita, and the presence of a charity care pool or fund. All
specifications include an indicator for the bottom-coding of seizable assets. Pooled 1996-2005 SIPP and 1999-2005 PSID, excluding households with
public insurance or a member age 65 or older, inflation-adjusted to 2005 using the CPI-U. Sample size is 1,907,703; and mean insurance coverage is

Notes: Table shows the coefficient on the cross-state simulated instrument from OLS regressions of measures of increased financial risk on the
cross-state simulated instrument. The dependent variables in columns 1 to 6 are indicators for increased perceptions of financial risk (e.g., higher
amounts owed for $12K medical bill). See Figure 3 or Section 3 for the full questions and responses. The dependent variable in columns 7 and 8 is a
standardized summary index, constructed by taking the weighted-mean of the outcomes where the weights are given by the inverse of covariance
matrix (Anderson, 2008). The cross-state simulated instrument is mean log seizable assets for a constant, nationally representative sample of
households as though they lived in each state. The survey was conducted in September 2011 on a commercial sample of single, childless adults age
27 to 49, screening out occupations with less than 10 percent uninsured in the March Supplement to the 2010 Current Population Survey. N = 800.

Notes: Microsimulation estimates of insurance take-up, willingness to pay (WTP), costs, and social surplus
from Pigovian and PPACA penalties relative to a baseline in which households can choose bankruptcy at
no cost. Pigovian penalty is the household-specific social cost of the implicit insurance from bankruptcy.
PPACA penalty is the inflation-adjusted, fully phased-in penalty under this legislation, defined as the
greater of $625 or 2.5 percent of income, up to a maximum of $2,085 per household. Take-up is the percent
of uninsured individuals that take up coverage. WTP is calculated using CARA utility with parameters of
2.5 × 10−5 (low risk aversion), 5.0 × 10−5 (moderate risk aversion), and 7.5 × 10−5 (high risk aversion).
Baseline insurance coverage rates with these risk aversion parameters are 64.4, 80.5, and 89.9 percent,
respectively. Household-level estimates weighted by number of individuals per household for
interpretation at the individual level.

Seizable Assets Calculation Details

In the SIPP, home equity is defined as equity in the primary residence or mobile home; vehicle
equity is defined as the sum of equity in all vehicles; retirement assets are defined as value in IRA,
Keogh, and 401K accounts; financial assets are the sum of interest earning assets, equity in stocks
and mutual fund shares, equity in other assets, equity in other real estate, and business equity.
Dischargeable debt is defined as total unsecured debt.
In the PSID, home and vehicle equity are defined as these variables; retirement assets are
defined as the value in private annuities or IRAs; financial assets are defined as wealth in checking
and saving accounts and in stock; other assets are defined as farm/business wealth, equity in other
real estate, and other savings or assets. Dischargeable debt is defined as other debt.
In the MEPS, home equity and vehicle equity are defined as these variables; retirement assets are defined as the value in IRA, Keogh, and 401K accounts; financial assets are defined as
the equity in farms or businesses, equity in other real estate, equity in a second home, equity in
recreational vehicles, the value of CDs, stocks, government or corporate bonds or mutual funds,
the value in checking or savings accounts, and other assets. Dischargeable debt is defined as other
debt.

Sensitivity of the Effect on Coverage

Table A1 shows alternative specifications of the effect on coverage. Panel A shows estimates from
the SIPP; Panel B shows estimates from the PSID. As a point of reference, column 1 displays the
pooled IV marginal effects from Table 6. Column 2 shows linear probability model estimates
of the same specification. The estimates are very similar. Column 3 examines the exclusion of
households with public insurance from the sample. Recall that these households were excluded
because households with public insurance typically face nominal premiums and are less likely
to make active decisions about coverage. When these households are included, the estimates are
barely changed.
Columns 4 and 5 examine two intervening channels through which bankruptcy law could
impact health insurance coverage. Asset exemptions affect the incentive to accumulate wealth because households with more seizable assets have less generous implicit insurance from bankruptcy.
If wealth impacts insurance coverage, then part of the effect of asset exemptions on insurance
could be mediated through a wealth response. Similarly, there is a literature that argues that
bankruptcy law affects the incentives to start a small business due to the fact that debts of noncorporate firms can be discharged in personal bankruptcy (Fan and White, 2003). If small business
ownership affects the probability of obtaining health insurance coverage, then part of the effect
could work through this channel. Columns 4 and 5 show that the estimates are very similar when
I add controls for wealth and business ownership, suggesting that these potential channels are not
particularly important.
The scatter plots in Figure 2 show that the effect on coverage is not overly influenced by a
small number of states. Figure A3 provides additional evidence on this matter, plotting marginal
effects from 51 separate regressions of the preferred specification (Table 6, column 3) in samples
that exclude each state. All of the estimates are statistically distinguishable from 0, and I cannot
reject the null of a constant effect across specifications.

Microsimulation Details

I construct the household-level medical cost distributions using individual-level medical cost data
from the 2005 MEPS for age-by-sex by insurance status cells.62 For insured individuals, costs are
defined as total payments. For uninsured individuals, my measure of costs is constructed in the
following way: I start with medical charges as this variable accounts for medical services written
off as charity care or bad debt. I then scale down charges by the cost-charge ratio (CCR) for the
privately insured population to account for the discount typically extended to the uninsured.63
Finally, I subtract out payments made by workers’ compensation, the Veterans Administration,
and other such sources, as the uninsured are not exposed to these costs.
Household-specific medical cost distributions are constructed numerically by summing over
10,000 independent draws from the appropriate individual-level distributions. As discussed in the
main text, I then adjust these costs for moral hazard to generate counterfactual cost distributions
for the insured and uninsured. Premiums are calculated as costs above the deductible scaled up
to account for administrative loading.
Appendix Table A2 compares premiums from the microsimulation model to quoted premiums in the individual market.64 The calibrated and market premiums are quite similar. The calibrated premiums are slightly less expensive for low deductible levels and somewhat more expensive for high deductibles. This difference could be explained by selection or by heterogeneity in
the moral hazard parameter across the expenditure distribution.

62 The

age-by-sex groups are 18 years old or younger, males age 19 to 34, females age 19 to 34, males age 35 to 64, and
females age 35 to 64.
63 Recall from Panel A of Figure 1 that privately insured and uninsured households make similar payments for low
charges.
64 Individual market premiums are for a 30-year-old male for policies starting in May 2010 listed on www.
eHealthInsurance.com. These policies include 20 coinsurance and are adjusted to 2005 values using the Medical Care component of the CPI-U.

Notes: Columns 1, 3, 4, and 5 shows marginal effects calculated at the mean of a log point increase in seizable assets on insurance coverage from IV
probit regressions. Column 2 shows coefficient from linear probability model. The pooled simulated instrument is mean log seizable assets by
constant, nationally representative demographic groups as though they lived in each state. Groups are defined by the full interaction of age group,
race, education group, and family structure. Demographic controls are demographic-group dummies and a fourth-order polynomial in annual
income. State controls are for individual market insurance regulations (see text for details), hospital ownership structure, DSH payments and
FQHC per capita, and the presence of a charity care pool or fund. All specifications include an indicator for the bottom-coding of seizable assets.
Pooled 1996-2005 SIPP and 1999-2005 PSID, excluding households with a member age 65 or older, inflation-adjusted to 2005 using the CPI-U. Mean
insurance coverage is 77.0 percent in SIPP and 77.3 percent in the PSID in the baseline sample. Block bootstrap standard errors clustered at the level
