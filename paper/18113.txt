ABSTRACT
I show that accounting for cross-industry variation in trade elasticities greatly magnifies the estimated
gains from trade. The main idea is as simple as it is general: While imports in the average industry
do not matter too much, imports in some industries are critical to the functioning of the economy, so
that a complete shutdown of international trade is very costly overall.

Introduction

Either the gains from trade are small for most countries or the workhorse models of trade
fail to adequately capture those gains. This uncomfortable conclusion seems inevitable given
recent results in quantitative trade theory. As shown by Arkolakis et al (2012), the gains
from trade can be calculated in the most commonly used quantitative trade models from the
observed share of a country’s trade with itself,

,

and the elasticity of aggregate trade ‡ows

with respect to trade costs, , using the formula  = (  )¬  .1 Using standard methods
to obtain estimates of



and , I show below that this implies that a move from complete

autarky to 2007 levels of trade would increase real income by only 16.5 percent on average
among the 50 largest economies in the world.
In this paper, I argue that the workhorse models of trade actually predict much larger
gains once the industry dimension of trade ‡ows is taken into account. The main idea is
as simple as it is general: While imports in the average industry do not matter too much,
imports in some industries are critical to the functioning of the economy, so that a complete
shutdown of international trade is very costly overall. In particular, I show that the above
¬ ~1

formula can be written as  = (  )

in a multi-industry environment, where the aggregate

is now a weighted average of the industry-level

 .

The point is that if  is close to zero

is close to in…nity in these industries which is su¢ cient to push

up

a lot. Loosely speaking,  is a weighted average of  so that the exponent of the aggregate
formula is the inverse of the average of the trade elasticities whereas the exponent of the
industry-level formula is the average of the inverse of the trade elasticities.
I make this point in the context of a simple Armington (1969) model in which consumers
have CES preferences within industries and goods are di¤erentiated by country of origin. As
is well-known, the trade elasticities then depend on the elasticities of substitution through
the simple relationship  =



¬ 1. Estimating these elasticities at the 3-digit level using the

standard method developed by Feenstra (1994) and re…ned by Broda and Weinstein (2006), I
show that the industry-level formula predicts that a move from autarky to 2007 levels of trade

This includes the Armington (1969) model, the Krugman (1980) model, the Eaton and Kortum (2002)
model, and the Melitz (2003) model. The aggregate trade elasticity  corresponds to di¤erent structural
parameters in di¤erent models.

increases real income by 48.6 percent on average which is around three times the number the
aggregate formula predicts. It increases even further once I allow for non-traded goods and
intermediate goods which have opposing e¤ects on the gains from trade. All things considered,
I …nd that the gains from trade average 55.9 percent among the 50 largest economies in the
year 2007.2
While my point may seem obvious once stated, I believe it has not been made explicitly
before. Arkolakis et al (2012) brie‡y discuss a multi-industry formula in an extension but
never contrast it to their aggregate formula or use it to actually calculate the gains from trade.
Caliendo and Parro (2015), Hsieh and Ossa (2012), Ossa (2014), and others work with multiindustry versions of standard trade models but also do not point out that cross-industry
heterogeneity in the trade elasticities has the potential to greatly magnify the gains from
trade. Closest in spirit is perhaps the contribution by Edmond et al (2012) which measures
the gains from trade originating from pro-competitive e¤ects in an oligopolistic trade model.
A key …nding is that such pro-competitive e¤ects are large if there is a lot of cross-industry
variation in markups which is the case if there is a lot of cross-industry variation in the
elasticities of substitution.3
Having said this, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) perform closely related calculations
in recently published contemporaneous work. In particular, they also work out the gains from
trade using the aggregate and industry-level formulas considering cases with and without
intermediate goods. While my analysis features more industries (252 instead of 31), more
countries (50 instead of 34), and uses di¤erent data (GTAP instead of WIOD), the main
distinction lies in the elasticity estimates. Instead of relying on elasticity estimates from the
literature, I estimate them using the Feenstra (1994)-Broda and Weinstein (2006) approach.
This allows me to estimate con…dence intervals for the elasticities and, in turn, also con…dence
2

While my general point also extends to imperfectly competitive gravity models such as Krugman (1980)
and Melitz (2003), the particular gains from trade predicted by my multi-sector Armington (1969) model are
only exactly the same in other perfectly competitive gravity models such as Eaton and Kortum (2002). This is
because the exact isomorphism between "old" and "new" trade models does not apply in the case of multiple
industries as shown by Arkolakis et al (2012). However, recent calculations by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare
(2014) suggest that even with multiple industries the gains from trade are quite similar in "old" and "new"
trade models.
3
Related points have, of course, also been made in other areas of macroeconomics. For example, Nakamura
and Steinsson (2010) show how cross-industry heterogeneity in menu costs substantially increases the degree of
monetary non-neutrality. Also, Jones (2011) argues that cross-industry complementarities through intermediate
goods matter a great deal for understanding cross-country di¤erences in incomes.

intervals for the gains from trade. Overall, the gains from trade appear to be quite precisely
estimated with the average 95-percent con…dence interval ranging from 49.3 percent until 62.5
percent.
The remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. In Section 2, I develop a multiindustry Armington (1969) model of trade in …nal and intermediate goods and show what
it implies for the measurement of the gains from trade. In Section 3, I describe the data
and discuss all applied aggregation, interpolation, and matching procedures. In Section 4, I
discuss the elasticity estimation and give an overview of the obtained results. In Section 5, I
report the gains from trade for 50 countries in the world and document that a small share of
industries typically accounts for a large share of the gains from trade.

Model

There are  countries indexed by  or  and  industries indexed by  or . In each country,
consumers demand an aggregate …nal good  and industry  producers demand an aggregate
intermediate good  . These aggregate goods are Cobb-Douglas combinations of industryP

 +
speci…c goods  ,  = 
=1  , which are in turn CES aggregates of industryspeci…c traded varieties  di¤erentiated by the location of their production. To be clear,

 denotes the quantity of the industry  traded variety from country  available in country
 and it is at that level of disaggregation that trade physically takes place. In sum,

Notice that I allow the Cobb-Douglas shares of the aggregate intermediate good to vary
by country , upstream industry , and downstream industry , which allows me to match
input-output tables from around the world. The aggregate …nal good translates one-for-one

into utility  . The aggregate intermediate good is combined with labor  using a CobbDouglas technology to produce the country-industry-speci…c traded varieties  with total

intuitive to most readers, I con…ne myself to sketching some core aspects here.

The value of industry  trade ‡owing from country  to country ,  , follows the

country , and  is total expenditure on all industry  varieties in country  originating

dampen the gains from trade, intermediate goods tend to amplify them so that abstracting
from both turns out to be a reasonable …rst pass. I remove non-traded goods by simply narrowing down the set of included industries, as I discuss below. I remove intermediate goods

Data

I focus on the world’s 49 largest economies and a residual Rest of the World in the year
2007.10 To quantify the gains from trade using formula (7), I need the full matrix of industry8

In the context of their discussion of aggregation biases in elasticity estimations, Imbs and Mejean (forthcoming) seem to conjecture that the gains from trade estimated using the aggregate formula would be the same
as the gains from trade estimated using the industry-level formula if the aggregate trade elasticity is estimated
using a method which does not su¤er from aggregation bias. A simple thought experiment reveals that this

imply that any reasonably measured aggregate trade elasticity is zero, which would be required, however, for
the aggregate formula to correctly predict in…nite gains from trade.
9
Notice that this can also be understood in terms of the familiar Jensen’s inequality. To be able to use the
aggregate formula, one essentially has to compute the aggregate trade elasticity as  =  ¬ 1  [ ( )], where
 ( ) = 1 is a convex and decreasing function of  . As a result, 

My main data source is the

eighth version of the Global Trade Analysis Project database (GTAP 8) which I supplement
with the widely used NBER-UN trade data from the time periods 1994-2008 when I need time
variation or a …ner disaggregation of industries. The GTAP 8 database is a carefully cleaned,
fully documented, publicly available, and globally consistent database covering 129 countries
and 57 industries which span all sectors of the economy.11
It is not obvious at what level of aggregation my analysis should be performed. On the
one hand, the main point of the paper is that excessive aggregation is likely to introduce
biases which suggests that a low level of aggregation should be preferred. On the other
hand, my Cobb-Douglas assumptions in consumption (



is constant) and production (




is constant) seem less reasonable the narrower the industry classi…cation which suggests that
disaggregating too …nely is problematic as well. Since departing from the Cobb-Douglas
assumption seems challenging particularly on the production side where it is the natural
interpretation of national input-output accounts, I choose the SITC-Rev3 3-digit level as a
compromise but also report results at a higher level of aggregation as a sensitivity check. After
constructing a cross-walk between the GTAP 8 data and the NBER-UN data, I am left with
251 industries from agriculture, mining, and manufacturing and a residual one aggregating
all other industries available in the GTAP database.
The NBER-UN data is originally at the SITC-Rev2 4-digit level and I convert it to the
SITC-Rev3 3-digit level using a concordance from the Center for International Data at UC
Davis. I then match the SITC-Rev3 3-digit industries to the GTAP industries using a concordance which I manually constructed with the help of various concordances available from
the GTAP website. By design, the SITC classi…cation focuses on traded goods only so that
the residual industry aggregates over the remaining industries of the economy which have
relatively little trade (the residual industry has an average




of 0.94 compared to an average

of 0.63 elsewhere and includes sectors such as construction and services). I will therefore

refer to the residual industry as the non-traded industry in the following even though I will
actually treat it as a traded industry with little trade.
To construct



and

,

I disaggregate the GTAP 8 data using bilateral trade shares

from the NBER-UN data. In particular, I calculate what share of each bilateral GTAP industry trade ‡ow should be attributed to each bilateral SITC-Rev3 3-digit trade ‡ow from the
NBER-UN data and then superimpose these shares onto the GTAP 8 data so that everything
aggregates back to the GTAP 8 data in the end. Since internal trade ‡ows are not reported
in the NBER-UN data, this strategy only works for international trade ‡ows and I simply
apportion internal trade ‡ows to SITC-Rev3 3-digit sectors uniformly.
The GTAP 8 data includes input-output accounts for all included countries which I use to
calculate




and

 .

One problem with input-output accounts for my purposes is that they

separate …rms’purchases into intermediate consumption (which is reported in the main body
of the input-output tables for each upstream-downstream industry pair) and …xed investment
(which is reported in a separate column of the input-output tables for each upstream industry
only) depending on how …rms treat these purchases in their balance sheets. Since I do not
explicitly allow for investment in my model, I scale all entries referring to …rms’intermediate
consumption by the total investment to intermediate consumption ratio of the corresponding
upstream industry to obtain a more accurate picture of what …rms actually buy.
For example, for each piece of "other machinery and equipment" classi…ed as intermediate
consumption in the US, there are 0.8 additional pieces classi…ed as …xed investment on average,
and I scale all intermediate consumption values in the input-output matrix by 1.8 to account
for this. Using this scaled data, I then simply read o¤ the share of intermediate consumption

Estimation

Using the abovementioned NBER-UN bilateral trade data for the years 1994-2008, I estimate
the elasticities of substitution



using the method developed by Feenstra (1994) and re…ned

by Broda and Weinstein (2006) for all 251 matched SITC-Rev3 3-digit traded industries (I
simply use the average



for the residual non-traded industry). This method identi…es the

elasticities from variation in the variances and covariances of demand and supply shocks across
countries and over time. I base my estimation on the instructions in Feenstra (2010) in which
the method is particularly clearly explained. My estimating equation is equation (2.21) in
Feenstra (2010) which I estimate using weighted least squares following the code provided
in Appendix 2.2 of Feenstra (2010). However, I do not focus on a single importer, but pool
across the 49 importers considered in my analysis (I keep all exporters available in the data).
This is not only consistent with my theoretical assumption that



does not vary by country

but also gives me a much larger dataset with over 5 million price-quantity pairs.
Table 1 lists the resulting elasticity estimates in increasing order together with the SITCRev3 code and an abbreviated description of the corresponding industry. As can be seen,
they range from 1.54 to 25.05 and have a mean of 3.63 which is within the range of other
estimates in the literature. Table 1 also reports the associated 95-percent con…dence intervals
which I obtained by bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions per industry. When resampling, I
always clustered by exporter and importer to ensure that it is conducted separately for each
exporter-importer pair. As can be seen, the con…dence intervals vary widely by industry and
are quite large on average. In particular, the average lower bound is 2.32 and the average
upper bound is 8.16 suggesting that it might be important to account for estimation error in

when assessing the reliability of estimates of the gains from trade.12

Results

Table 2 summarizes the changes in real income resulting from a move from autarky to year
2007 levels of trade. Columns 1-3 ("Unadjusted") focus on the special case without non-traded
and intermediate goods while columns 4-6 ("Adjusted") adjust for these e¤ects. Recall that
the special case without non-traded and intermediate goods involves dropping the residual
non-traded industry as well as setting



= 1 for all  and . The results under "Naive Gain"

are computed using the aggregate formulas, the entries under "True Gain" are computed
using the industry-level formulas, and the entries under "Ratio" are simply the ratio of the
two. When using the aggregate formulas, I work with
cross-industry average of all

As can be seen, allowing for cross-industry heterogeneity in the trade elasticities substantially increases the estimated gains from trade for all countries in the sample. While the
unadjusted median "naive" gains are only 16.5 percent, the unadjusted median "true" gains
are actually 48.6 percent so that accounting for cross-industry heterogeneity multiplies the median gains from trade by a factor of 3.1. Similarly, the adjusted median "naive" gains are only
16.9 percent while the adjusted median "true" gains are actually 55.9 percent, representing
an increase by a factor of 3.3. While the magni…cation e¤ect from having multiple industries
is similar to the one estimated by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014), my estimates of the
absolute gains from trade are quite a bit larger than theirs.13
Table 3 decomposes the "true" gains from trade into the own trade share and the exponent
from formula (7). This decomposition helps understand why allowing for non-traded and
intermediate goods does not change the gains from trade estimates that much. On the one
12

Recall that the Feenstra (1994)-Broda and Weinstein (2006) method assumes that all varieties are substitutes which is why all elasticity estimates and con…dence intervals in Table 1 imply   1.
13
Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) use the elasticity estimates of Caliendo and Parro (2015) which have
a higher variance, a higher mean, and a higher minimum value than the ones I use. The higher variance
explains why they …nd a similar magni…cation e¤ect despite using a higher level of aggregation. The higher
mean and higher minimum value explain why they estimate lower gains from trade.

hand, including non-traded industries raises the median own trade share from 63.8 percent
to 82.2 percent which tends to dampen the gains from trade. On the other hand, including
intermediate goods increases the median exponent from -0.9 to -2.3 which tends to magnify the
gains from trade. On average, these two forces are roughly o¤setting so that the unadjusted
special case provides a reasonable …rst pass. Columns 2 and 3 further reveal that most of the
variation in the unadjusted gains from trade is due to variation in

,

while columns 5 and

6 point out that variation in the exponent is more pronounced in the presence of non-traded
and intermediate goods.
This point is further explored in Figures 1-3. Figure 1 relates the unadjusted gains from
trade to the corresponding own trade shares and shows that the correlation is very tight.
Figure 2 does the same for the adjusted trade shares and it is clear that variation in the
exponent now plays a larger role. Figure 3 plots the unadjusted log gains from trade against
the adjusted log gains from trade and also includes a 45-degree line for ease of comparison.
As can be seen, allowing for non-traded and intermediate goods tends to lower the gains from
trade for richer countries but increase the gains from trade for poorer ones. The reason is that
richer countries tend to have higher expenditure shares on non-traded industries and are also
typically less dependent on imports for inputs that feature prominently in their input-output
accounts.
Table 4 reports the 95-percent con…dence intervals for the "true" gains reported in Table
2. These con…dence intervals are constructed by re-calculating the gains from trade for each
of the 1,000 sets of bootstrapped elasticity estimates. Despite the considerable noise in the
elasticity estimates, the con…dence intervals around the "true" gains from trade are actually
tighter than one might have thought. In particular, the median lower bound of the con…dence
intervals of the unadjusted "true" gains from trade is 41.4 percent while the median upper
bound of these gains is 52.8 percent. Similarly, the median lower bound of the con…dence
intervals of the adjusted "true" gains from trade is 49.3 percent while the median upper
bound of these gains is 62.5 percent. This happens because most of the variation in the
bootstrapped elasticity estimates is in the right tail which is exactly where the gains from
trade do not respond to elasticity changes that much.
Figure 4 illustrates that a large share of the adjusted "true" gains from trade can be
12

attributed to a small share of critical industries. I construct this …gure based on the relationP

formulas for the gains from trade. First, I rank all industries  by their contribution to the
P
overall log gains from trade ¬ =1 1¬1   ln (  ) for each country. Then, I compute the

shares of the log gains from trade due to shares of most important industries by cumulating
P
over ¬ =1 1¬1   ln (  ) for each country. Finally, I take the simple average of these

shares across countries. As can be seen, the 10 percent most important industries account for
roughly 90 percent of the log gains from trade on average.
Table 5 explores the sensitivity of the gains from trade estimates from Table 2 to the level
of industry aggregation. In particular, it replicates Table 2 after …rst aggregating all data
back to the GTAP level using trade-weighted averages of the elasticity estimates from Table
1. At this level of aggregation, there are only 28 traded industries instead of the 251 traded
industries used before.14 By construction, the "naive" gains from trade are the same in Tables
2 and 5. However, the "true" gains from trade are lower in Table 5 than in Table 2, as one
would expect given the higher level of aggregation. For example, the adjusted median "true"
gains fall from 55.9 percent to 35.2 percent when the analysis is conducted at the GTAP level
instead of the 3-digit level.

Conclusion

In this paper, I argued that accounting for cross-industry variation in trade elasticities greatly
magni…es the estimated gains from trade. The main idea was that a complete shutdown of
international trade is very costly even though imports in the average industry do not matter
too much since imports in some industries are critical to the functioning of the economy.
While I have made this point in the context of a simple Armington (1969) model, it should
be clear that it extends to other commonly used quantitative trade models. In an Eaton and
14
The original GTAP data actually features 42 traded industries. I aggregate them into 28 traded industries
by combining "paddy rice", "wheat", "cereal grains nec", "vegetables, fruits, nuts", "oil seeds", "plant-based
…bres", "crops nec", and "processed rice" into "products of agriculture, etc", "bovine cattle, sheep and goats,
horses", "animal products nec", and "wool, silk-worm cocoons" into "live animals, etc", "raw milk" and "dairy
products" into "milk and dairy products", "bovine meat products", "meat products nec", and "vegetable oils
and fats" into "meat, oil, etc", and "sugar cane, sugar beet", "sugar", and "food products nec" into "food
products nec". This is necessary to ensure that each SITC-Rev3 3-digit sector uniquely maps into one GTAP
sector.

13

Kortum (2002) model, for example, the interpretation would be that international productivity di¤erences are so large in some industries that replacing e¢ ciently-produced imports with
ine¢ ciently-produced domestic substitutes in these industries would imply extreme costs.

Note: This table summarizes the changes in real income resulting from a move from autarky to year 2007 levels of trade. The results under "True Gain"
are computed using the industry‐level formulas, the results under "Naïve Gain" are computed using the aggregate formulas, and the results under
"Ratio" simply compute the ratio of the two. Columns 1‐3 do not adjust for non‐traded or intermediate goods while columns 4‐6 do. I include Hong Kong
in my definition of China.

Note: This table provides more detail on the calculation of the gains from trade in Table 2. In particular, it again lists the gains from trade computed
using the industry‐level formulas and explicitly shows the λ and the exponent from formula (7). Notice that the gains and the λ are expressed as
percentages so that "True Gain (%)"=100*(("Lambda (%)"/100)^"Exponent"‐1). Columns 1‐3 do not adjust for non‐traded or intermediate goods while
columns 4‐6 do.

Note: This table summarizes the changes in real income resulting from a move from autarky to year 2007 levels of trade using a 2‐digit instead of a 3‐
digit industry aggregation. The results under "True Gain" are computed using the industry‐level formulas, the results under "Naïve Gain" are computed
using the aggregate formulas, and the results under "Ratio" simply compute the ratio of the two. Columns 1‐3 do not adjust for non‐traded or
intermediate goods while columns 4‐6 do. I include Hong Kong in my definition of China. The GTAP aggregation features 28 traded and one non‐traded
industry while the earlier 3‐digit aggregation features 251 traded and one non‐traded industry.
