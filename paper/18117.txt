Democracy and Reforms: Evidence from a New Dataset

NBER Working Paper No. 18117
June 2012
JEL No. E6,O57
ABSTRACT
Empirical evidence on the relationship between democracy and economic reforms is limited to few
reforms, countries, and periods. This paper studies the effect of democracy on the adoption of economic
reforms using a new dataset on reforms in the financial, capital and banking sectors, product markets,
agriculture, and trade for 150 countries over the period 1960–2004. Democracy has a positive and
significant impact on the adoption of economic reforms but there is scarce evidence that economic
reforms foster democracy. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a large variety of controls and
estimation strategies.

1. Introduction
Political and economic freedoms go hand in hand … or do they not? This is one of
the oldest questions in economics and in political science, which is still largely unanswered.
This paper answers this question using a novel dataset on economic reforms, which is the
most exhaustive in the literature in terms of country, year, and reform coverage. This
question is still open because there are very good theoretical arguments and numerous
examples as to why political freedom can either hinder or facilitate economic reforms.
History offers numerous examples where economic reforms were undertaken by
non-democratic regimes. Take the historical examples of Chile under Pinochet, South Korea
under Park, Mexico in 1986, or Guyana in 1988. In these cases, important economic reforms
were undertaken under non-democratic regimes. Historically, many contemporary
industrialized countries were not democracies when they took off economically (Schwarz,
1992). Most East Asian economies did not develop under fully democratic regimes. In
addition to these historical examples from several regions of the world and different
historical periods, compelling theoretical reasons may explain why less democratic regimes
may favor economic reforms and growth.
Democracy can hinder reforms if special interests prevail on the general welfare. A
democratic regime can fall prey to interest groups, which put their goals before general well
being. Capitalists entrenched in their rent-seeking positions are often the main opponents of
economic reforms (Rajan and Zingales, 2004). Interest groups can block reforms if there is
uncertainty about the distribution of the benefits (Fernandez and Rodrik, 1991). A
‘benevolent dictator’ can shelter the institutions, avoid that the state becomes captive of any
specific interest group, and allow the state to perform its function in an efficient way. Along
these lines, Haggard (1990) argues “... Institutions can overcome collective-action dilemmas
by restraining the self-interested behavior of groups through sanctions: collective action
problems can be resolved by command.” In addition to pressure from interest groups, wages
are typically higher under democracy (Rodrik, 1999) and democracy can lead to excessive
private and public consumption and lack of sufficient investment (Huntington, 1968).
Dictatorial regimes can also rely on financial repression to increase the domestic saving rate.
Several countries, including the Soviet Union and many East Asian countries, have been able
to increase savings, and ultimately achieve high economic growth rate, thanks to a repressive
political system and an attendant highly regulated financial system.
2

In conclusion, do the historical examples and the theoretical arguments provide a
compelling case against the role of democracy in fostering economic reforms? The answer to
this question is a resounding no.
The alternative view that democracy often accompanies economic reforms is also
based on strong theoretical arguments and solid empirical evidence. Secured property rights,
as guaranteed by a democracy, are considered key to economic development (de Soto, 2000).
In general, dictators cannot credibly make commitments because of time-inconsistency; so
no reform can be undertaken (McGuire and Olson, 1996). Autocratic rulers tend to be
predatory, disrupting economic activity and making any reform effort meaningless;
autocratic regimes have also an interest in postponing reforms and maintaining rentgenerating activities for a restricted number of supporting groups (Acemoglu and Robinson,
2012.) On the opposite, democratic rulers should be more sensitive to the interest of the
public, and so more willing to implement reforms, which destroy monopolies in favor of the
general interests. In addition to these theoretical arguments, there is strong empirical
evidence that reforms are highly correlated with democracy.
The correlation between democracy and economic reforms is very strong both
across time and in a cross section. Figure 1 shows the correlation over time between the
indices of democracy (measured as polity IV and normalized between 0 and 1) and reforms
(all the indices are normalized between 0 and 1, with 0 corresponding to the least reformed
and 1 to the most reformed) in the following six sectors (or areas)—(i) domestic financial, (ii)
capital account, (iii) product markets (electricity and telecommunications), (iv) agriculture, (v)
trade (based on tariffs) and (vi) current account transactions—over time (see below for
description). In all sectors democracy and regulation are strongly correlated, with democracy
usually preceding the deregulation process. Figure 2 shows that the correlation holds very
strongly also when we take a cross section: countries that are more democratic are also more
reformed. However, these correlations in themselves do not show that democracy
necessarily causes economic reforms. The correlation could run in the opposite direction, or
both democracy and economic reforms could be driven by a common third factor.
The sharp contrast between these opposing views has left the question of the effects
of democracy on economic reforms largely unanswered. The goal of this paper is to address
again this issue using a novel database, which covers almost 150 countries, 6 sectors and
spanning more than 40 years of data.
3

The main findings are that an increase in the quality of democratic institutions as
measured by the commonly used indices is significantly correlated with the adoption of
economic reforms but there is little evidence of a feedback effect from economic to political
liberalization. These results are robust to controlling for country, reform-specific effects, and
any possible interaction among them. Global reform waves and possible country-time
varying determinants of reforms (including crises, reforms in neighboring countries,
existence of compensation for losers, human capital and bureaucratic quality, and several
political variables) do not weaken these results, which are also robust to using an
instrumental variable strategy.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing
literature on economic reforms and democracy; Section 3 presents the data; Section 4
presents the results on the effects of democracy on reforms, controlling for other possible
determinants of reforms and the possibility of reverse causality and omitted variables;
Section 5 concludes.
2. Democracy and Reforms: Theory and Empirics
Economic theory does not give a clear answer on whether political liberalizations
favor or hinder economic reforms or if the relationship could go both ways.1 Democratic
regimes could lead to more economic reforms if reforms create more winners than losers
(Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005). Democratically elected governments may also have greater
legitimacy to implement and sustain policies bearing short-term costs; similarly institutional
changes—e.g., strengthening an independent legal system or a professional civil service
required to ensure political freedom and democracy—could lead also to successful market
reforms. Finally, democracy could create an environment conducive to economic reforms by
limiting rent-seeking and putting in place a system of checks and balances (Dethier, Ghanem
and Zoli, 1999). In general, Democratic regimes have characteristics that lessen the timeinconsistency (Quinn 2000). The political liberalization brought about by perestroika and
glasnost in Soviet Union after 1985 created demand for economic freedom. In Eastern
Europe political liberalization usually preceded economic liberalization.

For the question if economic reforms have an impact on growth see Prati, Onorato, and
Papageogiou, forthcoming.

Alternatively, political liberalization could lead to less economic reforms if the
electoral system creates a pivotal voter with veto power. For instance, it has been argued that
Chile in the late 70s and the 80s implemented several forward-looking economic reforms
because the military regime did not have to respond to a short-sighted electorate. At the
same time, it has been argued that Costa Rica has been a laggard in economic reforms
because the democratic system gives veto power to groups that can lose from reforms. In
fact, uncertainty about the impact of economic reforms at the individual level could also lead
a rational electorate to vote against reforms even if they are known ex ante to benefit a
majority of them (Fernandez and Rodrik, 1991).
The theoretical predictions about the feedback effect from economic reforms to
democratization are ambiguous as well. For example, economic liberalizations could be
associated with higher quality of democratic institutions if they increase the power of the
middle class (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). On the other hand, liberalization could lower
democracy through increases in income inequality and the associated political strife and
violence (Quinn, 1997, Dixon and Boswell, 1996).
On the empirical side, a few empirical papers have looked at the relationship
between democracy and reforms. Among the available evidence, Giavazzi and Tabellini
(2005) study the feedback effects between economic and political liberalizations. Economic
liberalization is defined as the event of becoming open, where openness is defined as in
Wacziarg and Welch (2008). Political liberalization is the event of becoming a democracy;
where democracy is defined by strictly positive values of polity2. Using a panel of 140
countries over 1960–2000 (with country and year fixed effects), they find evidence of a
positive and significant relationship between democratizations and trade reforms; they find
that the feedback effect could run in both directions although the causality is more likely to
run from political to economic reforms. Similarly, Persson (2005) shows that the forms of
democracy (e.g. parliamentary, proportional and permanent ones) explain variation in trade
reforms (measured by the Wacziarg and Welch index and an index of property rights
protection). Banerji and Ghanem (1997), and Milner and Kubota (2005) also look at trade
reforms. The former presents cross-country evidence to show that authoritarian regimes are
associated with higher protectionism (measured by an index of protectionism from Dollar
(1992)), while the latter show that regime changes towards democracy are associated with
greater liberalization (measured by tariff rates and Sachs Warner indices). Banerji and
5

Ghanem (1997) also find evidence that more authoritarian regimes are associated with
greater wage distortions, as measured by the ratio of manufacturing wage rate to the
nonmanufacturing value added per worker. Amin and Djankov (2009) show that democracy
(measured by Freedom House or Polity IV scores) is good for micro-reforms (as defined in
the World Bank’s Doing Business Database). Eichengreen and Leblang (2008) find evidence
of a positive two-way relationship between democracy and globalization defined as trade and
capital account liberalization. They, however, find that these effects are not uniform across
time and space.2
Quinn (2000) examines the relationship between democracy and international
financial liberalization. He measures international financial regulation through changes in
current and capital account openness created using the Exchange Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions from the IMF. Democracy is measured by changes in polity2. Quinn uses both
panel data techniques and individual country VARs for 40–50 countries over 1950–97 and
finds evidence that democracies liberalize international finance, especially capital accounts.
Unlike this paper, he also finds evidence of feedback effects from financial liberalization to
democratizations whereby capital account liberalization is associated with decreases in
democracy 6 to 15 years later. Mulligan, Gill and Sala-i-Martin (2004) do not look specifically
at reforms, but analyze the effect of democracy on public spending and taxes. They do not
find any significant relationship between democracy and total government consumption,
education or social spending; but find that democracies are associated with flatter income
taxes (or less income redistribution). Finally, Olper, Falkowski and Swinnen (2009) study the
effect of regime transitions from autocracy to democracy on agricultural policy distortions,
measured by indicators of government transfers to the agriculture sector. They find that
while agriculture protection increases after a country’s transition to democracy, there is no
effect when the regime shifts from democracy to autocracy.
Other papers examine the relationship between economic and political liberalizations
in the context of post-communist countries. For example, Fidrmuc (2003) in a sample of
25 transition countries over 1990-2000 finds a positive relationship between the indices of
liberalization and democracy. Liberalization is measured by an average of various reform
indicators developed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development covering
See also Alesina, Ardagna, and Trebbi (2005), Abiad and Mody (2005), Drazen and Easterly (2001),
and Lora (1998).

privatization, governance and enterprise restructuring, price liberalization, trade and foreign
exchange, competition policy, and banking and securities markets. Democracy is measured
by an average of the indicators of political rights and civil liberties reported by the Freedom
House. In a similar vein, Dethier, Ghanem, and Zoli (1999) also find that political freedom
and civil liberties facilitated economic liberalization in the 25 post-communist countries
between 1992 and 1997. Milner and Mukerjee (2009) find evidence that democracy fosters
trade and capital account liberalization, but also that the impact of openness of democracy is
quite weak in developing countries. Grosjean and Senik (2011) using a survey conducted in
2006 by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank in 28
post-transition countries find a significant effect of democracy (measured by the Freedom
House democracy score) on market liberalization, but no evidence of a feedback effect. In
addition to the statistical analysis, some papers (Bates and Krueger, 1993) have focused on
case studies. This approach takes into account the complexity and the country specificity of
the interaction between democracy and economic reforms.
To summarize, while there are many theoretical predictions about the relationships
between political and economic liberalizations, empirical evidence on the subject is limited to
reforms in particular sectors, in particular international trade and finance, micro-reforms, or
specific countries over a short period.
Our study is the first one to combine a comprehensive coverage of reforms in
different sectors, a significant coverage of countries and a long time period. In particular, the
dataset used in this paper spans six sectors, and both developing and developed countries
from the 1960 up until 2004.
3. Data
3.1. Data on reforms
Our analysis is based on a completely new and extensive dataset, compiled by the
Research Department of the IMF, describing the degree of regulation for a sample of 150
industrial and developing countries. The new dataset thus has significant advantages over
existing data sources, which cover a narrower set of reforms and countries. Reform
indicators cover six sectors, including both financial and real sectors. Financial sector reform
indicators include reforms pertaining to domestic financial markets and the external capital
account, while real sector structural reform indicators include measures of product and
7

agriculture markets, trade, and current account reforms. Each indicator contains different
sub-indices summarizing different dimensions of the regulatory environment in each sector.
The sub-indices are then aggregated into indices and normalized between 0 and 1. We
construct all the measures of reform in each sector so that higher values represent greater
degrees of liberalization.
Table 1 presents a brief definition and sources of the reform indicators used in this
paper. IMF (2008) describes all data sources and full details of the construction of the
indicators.
3.1.1. Financial sector reforms in the domestic financial market
The dataset contains two measures of financial sector reforms, one for the domestic
financial sector and the other regarding the extent of capital account liberalization. The
domestic financial sector liberalization indicator in turn includes measures of securities markets
and banking sector reforms. The securities markets sub-index assesses the quality of the market
framework, including the existence of an independent regulator and the extent of legal
restrictions on the development of domestic bond and equity markets. The banking subindex captures reductions or removal of interest rate controls (floors or ceilings), credit
controls (directed credit and subsidized lending), competition restrictions (limits on branches
and entry barriers in the banking market, including licensing requirements or limits on
foreign banks), and public ownership of banks. The banking index also captures a measure
of the quality of banking supervision and regulation, including the power and independence
of bank supervisors, the adoption of Basel capital standards, and the presence of a
framework for bank inspections.
3.1.2. Capital account liberalization
The second measure of reform in the financial sector pertains to the extent of the
external capital account liberalization. The index contains information on a broad set of
restrictions including, for example, controls on external borrowing between residents and
non-residents, as well as approval requirements for foreign direct investment (FDI).
3.1.3. Product market reforms
Turning to the real sector, the product market indicator covers the degree of
liberalization in the telecommunication and electricity markets, including the extent of
competition in the provision of these services, the presence of an independent regulatory
authority, and privatization.
8

3.1.4. Agricultural market reforms
The agricultural sector indicator captures intervention in the market for the main
agricultural export commodity in each country. It measures the extent of public intervention
in the market going from total monopoly or monopsony in production, transportation or
marketing (i.e., the presence of marketing boards), the presence of administered prices,
public ownership of relevant producers or concession requirement to free market.
3.1.5. Trade reforms
Trade reforms are captured by using two different indicators: one based on tariffs
and the other measuring the extent of current account liberalization. The indicator based on
tariff liberalization is meant to capture distortions in international trade and is measured by
average tariffs.
3.1.6. Current account liberalization reforms
The second indicator for measuring reform in the trade sector broadly measures the
extent of current account liberalization. It captures the extent to which a government is
compliant with its obligations under the IMF’s Article VIII to free from government
restriction the proceeds from international trade in goods and services.
Additional details on the sources and specifics of each indicator can be found in IMF
(2008) and Table 1.
3.2. Aggregation and normalization
For each of our six sectors, we construct an aggregate index by averaging the subindices for that particular sector (for the cases in which we do have multiple sub-indices, like
product market or the financial sector). Each sectoral indicator is then normalized between 0
and 1, where 1 indicates a higher degree of liberalization. “Reform” in any sector is then
defined as an annual change in the index. Table 2 reports the pair wise correlations between
different types of reforms. Financial sector, trade, current, and capital account reforms are
strongly correlated among themselves, and less so with agricultural and product market
reforms (with the exception of the financial sector reform which is strongly correlated to
product market reforms). Overall the correlations indicate that once the process of reform in
a country starts, it probably spreads over to several sectors. This paper does not consider the
issue of sequencing among different types of reforms. For an analysis of sequencing see IMF
(2008), showing that trade reforms tend to precede financial and capital account reforms. We
run most of our regressions at the sector-country and year level; however as one of our
9

robustness checks we also aggregate the six reform indicators using a principal component
analysis.
3.3. Other data
Democracy is measured using the standard, well-established measure of democracy
taken from the Polity IV database. In particular, we use the combined polity2 index ranging
from -10 to 10 (-10=high autocracy; 10=high democracy). We also check our results using
the Freedom House Index and the index proposed by Przeworski, Alvarez, Cheibub, and
Limongi (1993). Note that the trend toward more democratic regimes has not been linear.
Significant retrenchment of democracy has not only been observed in isolated countries but
also in several regions of the world. The examples include the general decrease in democracy
in Asia in the 1950s and 1960s, the marked decline in Latin America in 1960s and 1970s, and
the prolonged stasis in Africa since the 1960s (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). We
normalize the index so that 1 indicates the most democratic country and 0 the least
democratic regime.
We also include in our specifications the following controls:


Initial level of regulation (as measured by the lagged level of the regulation index):
this variable can be a proxy for important incentives in favor and against the
implementation of structural reforms. Excessive government regulation and/or
market failures may be perceived as more costly when the economy is least reformed.
At the same time, the beneficiaries of existing large rents may oppose reforms.



Economic crisis: According to a widely held view, economic crises foster economic
reforms by making evident the cost of stagnation and backwardness. The opposite
view maintains that it is easier to implement reforms during periods of economic
growth when potential losers can find other opportunities in a booming economy or
when countries become richer and have more resources to compensate the losers. In
order to test this hypothesis, we use several measures of crisis: a dummy equal to 1 if
the country is experiencing inflation larger than 40 percent in that year, a measure for
recession (as summarized by a dummy indicating negative growth in per-capita
GDP), terms of trade shocks, and banking and debt crisis. The data on banking and
debt crises come from Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).



Public expenditures/GDP and real devaluation: Compensation schemes can
offset costs associated with reforms. A large government may compensate losers
10

from reforms than a very lean government with a small budget. We use public
expenditures/GDP as a proxy of the size of social safety nets. As an alternative
measure of compensation, we also control for real devaluation, which could promote
exports and therefore help compensate losers from reforms. For instance, some
important reforms happened together with large devaluation and in the context of
IMF-supported programs.


Human capital and effectiveness of bureaucracy could also facilitate reforms
(Besley and Personn, 2007). We use enrollment in tertiary education from Barro and
Lee (2001) as a measure of human capital and bureaucratic quality from the
International Country Risk Guide. The measure of bureaucratic quality from ICRG
is scored between 0-6. High scores indicate “autonomy from political pressure” and
“strength and expertise to govern without drastic changes in policy or interruptions
in government services”; also existence of an “established mechanism for recruiting
and training.”



Reforms in neighboring countries or in trading partners may affect the adoption
of domestic reforms through peer pressure and imitational effects. We use the
weighted average of reforms in neighboring countries, where the weights are given
by two concepts of distance defined by geography and trade. The source for
geographic distance is http://www.cepii.fr/anglaisgraph/bdd/distances.htm and for
bilateral trade flows, the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics.



The ideology of the ruling government and the form of government may
determine the adoption of reforms. Alesina and Roubini (1992) argue that right-wing
governments are normally considered more inclined to market-oriented reforms;
Persson and Tabellini (2002) finds that a presidential system facilitates reforms as
they are more able to overcome the resistance of small interest groups. We capture
the ideological orientation of the executive with the indicator left, which is equal to 1
if the executive belongs to a party of the left and 0 if it belongs to a right-wing,
centrist or other party. The form of government is proxied by the variable presidential,
which takes the value of 1 if the system is directly presidential and 0 if the president
is elected by the assembly or parliamentary. The source for these two variables is the
Database of Political Institutions from the World Bank. We also included in the
regressions additional political variables such as number of executive constraints, the
11

presence of legislative or executive elections, the number of years left in the current
term for the executive and the presence of an absolute majority in the legislature by
the party of the executive. The results are robust to the inclusion of these additional
political variables.
Table A1 provides the summary statistics for the key variables used in the empirical analysis.
4. Empirical strategy
The unit of analysis is a sector-country-year observation (there are 6 sectors, 150
countries, and 45 years); the resulting dataset is a panel of 20,123 observations. We define
reform as a change over time in the index of regulation for each of the six sectors, s, in
country c at time t:
reforms ,c ,t  Indexs ,c ,t  Indexs ,c ,t 1 ,

Our baseline specification is as follows:
, ,

, ,

,

,

(1)

, ,

where  s ,  c and  t are sector, country, and year fixed effects, respectively, and

X ct 1 are country-specific and time-varying controls to be described below.

and

are the interactions between country and sector fixed effects; and sector and time
fixed effects respectively.
We also control for the lagged level of the index to identify the existence of
convergence toward some possible country specific levels of regulation. Being bounded
between zero and one, the reform variables do not have a unit root; however, they can still
exhibit a trend within the bounds. In Table A5 we report standard panel unit root tests for
each reform indicator and for the democracy index. We reject the null of unit roots for
polity2 at the 10 percent level; in addition most of our reform indices do not show evidence
of unit roots; hence we use the level of the reform index, reform s ,c ,t  Index s ,c ,t  as the
dependent variable.
The dependent variable (reform in a country) is highly persistent; for this reason the
error terms in specification (1) may also exhibit serial correlation. We allow for first-order
serial correlation in the error terms:  t   t 1  ut . The Durbin-Watson statistic for the

12

transformed regression is 1.94 indicating that there is little evidence of serial correlation in
the transformed error terms. 3
Our first specification includes only sector, country, and time fixed effects (Table 3,
column 1). The coefficient on the lagged level of the index is negative and significant at the 1
percent level, indicating convergence toward country specific levels of regulation. The
coefficient on the lagged level of democracy is significant at the 1 percent level. The
magnitude of the estimated effect implies that a one standard deviation increase in the
democracy index explains 7 percent variability in reforms. In addition, moving to a complete



democracy in the long-run is associated with a 0.22     increase in the index of reform


(using the coefficients of column 1).
We then add country-sector specific effects, and sector-year specific effects and both
of them (column 2, 3 and 4 respectively).4 The interactions between country and sector fixed
effects take into account that reforms are inherently different across countries, e.g., trade
sector reforms in India have different characteristics than banking reforms in Brazil
(Specification 2). The interactions between sector and year effects account for the possibility
of global reform waves across all countries (Specification 3). Specification 4 is the most
demanding because it includes all the individual fixed effects and possible two-way
interactions. Notice that we cannot control for country-time effects, since the main variable
of interest, which is democracy, is country-time varying. The results are very similar across
specifications. The magnitude of the coefficients on the democracy variable ranges from .02
to .03 in columns 2-4.
The results in Table 3 show that the correlation between (lagged) democracy level and
the adoption of reforms is not driven by country or sector-fixed characteristics or by the fact
that there was a worldwide movement toward reforms and democracy, or any interactions
between country-sector and sector-time fixed characteristics.
If the correlation between economic reforms and democracy is not due to spurious
correlation owing to a common trend, could it be driven by other country-time varying
3 We also test the robustness of our results by clustering the error terms at the country-reform and
country level. See Section 4.4 for details.
4 In specifications (2) and (4), we allow the serial correlation coefficient in the error term to be
country-sector specific. In specifications (1) and (3), the serial correlation coefficients are countryspecific.

omitted variables? The next subsection checks whether this correlation is robust to the
inclusion of several variables, which (current theories suggest) may explain both economic
reforms and democracy, i.e., the possible bias deriving from country-sector-time varying
omitted variables.
4.1. Additional controls
Reforms may be triggered by a wide range of factors other than democracy.
Following the theoretical literature reviewed above, in Table 4 we control for the following
possible determinants of reforms: measures of crisis (a dummy equal to 1 if the country
experiences inflation larger than 40 percent, we include alternative measures of crisis in
Table 7b), public expenditure/GDP and real devaluation, human capital and bureaucratic
quality, reforms in neighbors, and political variables (Columns 1-5). Column 6 includes all
the controls simultaneously. The results on the coefficients of our controls go in the
expected direction but are often not significant. For example, episodes of hyperinflation
appear to reduce the probability of reforming (Column 1), but the effect disappears when all
the other controls are added to the specification. Reforms in neighboring countries appear
to spur domestic reforms. This result, which extends the results of IMF (2004) on OECD
countries, is also in line with Buera, Monge, and Primiceri (2008), who find a spillover effect
from beliefs in neighboring countries. The variable however also looses significance when all
the controls are included. 5
Democracy is the only variable which remains consistently significant across all
specifications. We also look at the standardized beta coefficients for democracy across the
different regressions and find them to be remarkably similar.
The inclusion of the different controls changes the sample size in each column of
Table 4. To check that our results are not driven by the specific sample, we also estimate the
basic specification (Table 3, column 4) for each column of Table 4. The results shown in
Table 4 do not appear to be driven by sample selection. The results on the various restricted
samples of Table 4 are reported in the Table A4 in the Appendix.
4.2. Endogeneity
5 In additional robustness, we also include dummies for WTO, EU, and OECD accessions (=1 in
years following the accession) and for the existence of an IMF program. The coefficient on
democracy remains positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The coefficients on EU,
OECD and IMF program dummies are significant in the specification without any controls, but lose
their significance when included along with other controls in Table 4, Column 6.

14

Another source of bias derives from the fact that reforms themselves may have an
effect on democracy. In order to deal with this issue we have two approaches: 1) we use
instrumental variables, and 2) we check if reforms cause democracy (in the final section of
the paper).
While an ideal source of exogenous variation of democracy is difficult to find, we use
democracy in neighboring countries as an instrument where we use the concept of political
distance to define the neighbors. The idea behind this instrument is that democracy in
political allies has influence on domestic democracy but no direct impact on a country’s
ability to reform. For instance, the political alliance between the U.S. and Western Europe
had surely an effect on democracy in Western Europe but not a direct effect on the reform
level in Europe. The idea underlying this instrument is based on Persson and Tabellini
(2009), who use democracy in neighboring countries as a proxy for democratic capital. In
addition, building on this concept, we also tried different measures of distance, including
geographical distance between countries and commercial distance defined as the (inverse of)
trading flows between countries. These measures, which are highly correlated, confirm the
result of political distance reported here.
Table 5A shows the regressions using lagged democracy in political neighbors as an
instrumental variable. The coefficient of lagged democracy in the first stage (Table 5B)
confirms the relevance of democracy in neighbors in promoting the democratic process in
the domestic economy. The results in our second stage show that, consistent with the OLS
specification, there is evidence for a strong and positive effect of democracy on reforms.
The estimated effect is not statistically significant in the specification which includes all the
controls (column 1c). The magnitude of the estimated effect is, however, not significantly
different from Column 1b, which uses a larger sample and a restricted set of controls
suggesting that the statistical insignificance in specification 1c is likely to be driven by the
large standard errors from the smaller sample. The regression in column 1d, where the
sample is the same as column 1c but without the inclusion of controls, indeed confirms that
this is the case.
4.3. Regressions by sector
Does democracy have a differential effect across sectors? Alternatively, are the
results presented above driven by a particular sector? We explore this possibility by looking
at the impact of democracy on reforms in different sectors. Table 6 presents one
15

specification without any control except country and year fixed effects (this is analogous to
the specification in Table 3) and one specification with control variables, including indicators
of crisis, devaluation, public expenditure as a share of GDP, bureaucratic expenditure,
tertiary enrollment, reforms in neighboring countries, dummy for parties for the left in
power, and dummy for presidential form of government (this is analogous to column (6) in
Table 4).
The results in Table 6 show that democracy promotes reforms in all sectors with the
exception of product markets in the specification with controls. In most cases the coefficient
on democracy is significant at one percent level despite the reduced number of observations.
We prefer the general specification that encompasses all sectors in order to maximize
the number of observations so that we can control for country, reform, and year fixed
effects and (most importantly) their interactions as shown in Table 3.
4.4 Other robustness checks
Structural reforms and democratization sometimes come in waves. For instance,
several countries in Central and Eastern Europe became more democratic and implemented
economic reforms in few years after 1989. In this section we control to which extent the
inclusion of a group of countries in our sample drives the results. The results are reported in
Table 7a. In columns 1a–1b and 2a–2b, the sample is restricted to non-communist and
developing countries respectively (we estimate two regressions for each subsample with and
without the inclusion of controls).
Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) use a zero-one definition of democracy (where
democracy=1 if polity2 has positive values) because the degree of democracy can be difficult
to quantify using a cardinal measure. Following this line, we repeat our baseline regression
using a zero-one definition of democracy. Columns 3a-3b of Table 7a reports the results.
The results do not change in the baseline regression but are weaker when we include all the
controls because the sample size is much smaller, in column 3c we indeed show that the
impact of democracy on reform on the restricted sample but without the inclusion of
controls is also not significant. For each specification with controls in Table 7a, we also
estimate the basic specification (Table 3, column 4) without any controls on the restricted
sample (not shown). We do this to analyze the effect of adding controls on a consistent
sample. The results in Table 7a are not driven by sample selection.

16

Assumptions on the error terms are key to evaluate the significance of the
coefficients. So far we have allowed for an AR(1) term in the model. Column 1 in Table 7b
presents the basic specification without controls in which the standard errors are clustered at
the country-reform level. The results are similar if we cluster at the country rather than
country-reform level.
Reforms in trading partners (Column 2 of Table 7b) and reforms in other sectors
(Column 3 of Table 7b) also do not alter our main conclusion, and the results are also robust
to a variety of crisis definitions (negative per-capita GDP growth, banking and debt crises
and terms-of-trade shocks-columns 4 to 7 of Table 7b).
By including the lagged level of reform, the specifications so far have assumed that
there is (conditional) convergence in the reform adoption. By including country fixed effects,
we assume a country specific long run level of reforms. However, unlike growth regressions,
there is no theoretical reason why we should expect convergence in the level of regulation.
In order to test if our results depend on this assumption, we replicate the specification in
Table 3 without the lagged reform index using the following specifications:
∆

, ,

,

, ,

(2)

Column (8) in Table 7b reports the results from estimating Equation (2). The
estimated coefficient on lagged (democracy) is positive and statistically significant at the
1 percent level. The magnitude of the estimated coefficient (β= 0.011) is smaller than in
Table 3. This is consistent with a positive correlation between (lagged) democracy and the
lagged reform index, and a negative relationship between reform and the lagged reform
index. This coefficient, however, is not comparable to the coefficient in the previous
regressions in Table 3 given that the magnitude of the estimated coefficient on democracy in
this regression can be interpreted only as the effect of democracy on the rate of adoption of
structural reforms rather than on the steady-state level. Unlike Equation (1), the specification
in Equation (2) has the drawback that the steady state level of the index is undefined; hence
the long-run effect of democracy on the reform index cannot be estimated. In effect, we are
assuming that a certain level of democracy is associated only with a rate of growth of the
reform index.

17

Democracy could have a non linear effect on reforms if reforms start only when a
certain level of democracy is reached. To check this hypothesis, we replicate our baseline
regression (with different combinations of fixed effects) for different levels of democracy.
These regressions reported in Table 8 show some evidence for non-linear effects of
democracy on reforms: the more democratic the country is initially, the easier it is to reform.
We also explore whether democracy affects the probability of reversal in reforms
(defined as a decrease in the level of index). Reform reversals constitute 8 percent of the
observations in our sample. We do not find any evidence for this hypothesis (see Table A6).
4.5. The feedback effect
In this section, we check whether economic reforms foster democracy. We test for
the possibility of a feedback effect from reforms to democracy by estimating the following
regression:

Δ

,

,

,

,

(3)

In order to estimate the feedback effect, we need to collapse our data at the country
level. The term “average reform” in equation 3 now refers to the arithmetic average of the
reform indices.
Overall, we find little evidence that reforms promote the democratic process (Table
9a 6 . Our results therefore do not support a reverse causality story. Since income is
considered an important determinant of democratization, we also test robustness to
including per capita income in the regressions (results available upon request). Including the
lagged level of the index, rather than the change as in Table 9a, also does not alter the
findings in Table 9a. We also repeat the same exercise reform by reform (Table 9b) and find
little evidence of feedback (we find evidence of a feedback effect for the agricultural sector
but only in the specification in which all controls are included).
4.6. Difference-in-difference approach
In this section we use a different empirical strategy to test for the presence of a
feedback effect. Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) look at the relationship between democracy
and reforms in the trade sector using a difference-in-difference approach. They interpret

6

The results are similar when we use longer lags.

18

reforms as a ‘‘treatment’’ administered to some countries but not others, and estimate the
causal effect of the treatment through a difference-in-difference estimation. They estimate
the following regressions in the whole sample of treated and control countries,
(4)
where

denotes the measure of performance, a and b are country and year fixed effects,

respectively,

is a set of other control variables,

is a dummy variable taking a

value of 1 in the years after the reform in the treated countries and 0 otherwise (i.e.,
is 0 in the treated countries before the reform and in the control countries) and
is an unobserved error term. In their regressions to study the interactions between
political and economic liberalizations (Table 5 in their paper), reform variable is either
political or economic. Political reform is a dummy variable taking a value of 1 in the years
after democratization, where democratization is defined as the event of becoming a
democracy (defined by discrete jumps in polity2 around zero), given that a country was not a
democracy in the previous year. Similarly, economic reform is a dummy taking a value of 1
in the years after becoming economically open (defined by the Wacziarg and Welch (2003)
openness index). In the regressions of economic on political reform, the dependent variable
is the openness index, and in the feedback regression, the dependent variable is polity2.
Based on the regressions, they find that the causality is more likely to run from
political to economic reforms. Their approach is a useful alternative way to check both
directions of causality from democratization to introduction of economic reforms and vice
versa. In Table 10, we report the results repeating their methodology on our dataset (the top
panel showing the effect of the `treatment’ democratization on economic reforms; the
bottom panel takes economic reforms as treatment). All regressions control for time and
country fixed effects. Democratization has a positive effect on all economic reforms with
significant effect on finance, agriculture, and trade. However, there is little evidence of the
opposite (i.e. economic reforms do not precede democratization).7 We view our results as
broadly in line with those of Giavazzi and Tabellini.
7 Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) find a coefficient of -0.16 when regressing democracy on trade
reforms (Table 4, Column 1 in their paper). Their coefficient like ours is not significant. To make our
results as comparable as possible to their strategy, we first replicate their estimation on their sample
and their reform measures. The coefficient is very close to the original paper and equal to -0.06. We
then use our trade reform measure on their sample and use their empirical strategy. The coefficient is
in this case equal to 0.39, but is also statistically indistinguishable from zero. Therefore, even using

19

4.7. Factor analysis
In this section, we implement a different approach from the panel analysis presented
above. To take into account the possibility that the reform process is one unique process
common to all sectors, we undertake a factor analysis of our measures of reforms in the six
sectors. In particular, we extract the first principal component from the whole dataset with
all the data on reforms for each sector.8 The results are reported in Table 11. The impact of
democracy seems to be relevant for the overall tendency of a country to reform (the
coefficient on the lagged level of democracy is significant at the 1 percent level): moving to a
complete democracy in the long-run is associated with a 0.03 increase in the index of reform
(the magnitude doubles when we instrument for lagged democracy using lagged democracy
in neighboring countries). On the other hand, we do not find any evidence of a feedback
effect from the impact of the overall tendency of a country to reform on democracy.
5. Conclusions
The question of whether democratic countries favor economic reforms is central to
the political economy literature. Political economists study why apparently welfare-enhancing
reforms are postponed or adopted with long delays and the presence (or the absence) of
democracy is one of the main causes investigated. Unfortunately, despite the vast theoretical
literature and limited empirical evidence (unfortunately restricted to some countries, to some
reforms, and to some periods), the answer to this question has been tentative because of
data limitations, which has also limited the techniques that can be used.
This paper answers this question using a novel dataset on structural reforms, which
encompasses several sectors and many countries for several years. This dataset allows us to
control for a set of possible omitted variables, including country and reform fixed effects,
possible two-way interactions between the fixed effects and waves of reforms.
The main conclusions of the papers are that 1) democracy and economic reforms are
positively correlated (after controlling for country and reform-specific characteristics, any
interaction between country and reform characteristics, and global reform waves); 2) this
correlation is robust even after we control for standard factors, which are usually correlated
our trade index on exactly their sample, and replicating their methodology, we fail to find any
significant feedback effects.
8 The variable is then normalized between 0 and 1 to make the results comparable to the remaining
part of the paper.

20

with reforms and democracy, including bureaucratic quality and education, and political
stability; 3) the correlation is also robust to the variables that are usually associated with
reforms (but not necessarily with democracy) such as crises, neighboring country effects, and
compensation schemes; and 4) there is no evidence that economic reforms pave the way for
political reforms.
The strong correlation between (lagged) democracy and the adoption of economic
reforms, even controlling for many possible factors as well as the finding that (lagged)
economic reforms are not associated with the adoption of democracy point to the fact there
is probably a causal link from democracy to reforms.
These strong results call for an effort to study the precise mechanisms through
which democracy has an impact on economic reforms.

Notes: This figure shows the correlation in 2000 between the indices of democracy on the y-axis (measured as polity IV and normalized between 0 and 1) and reforms
on the x-axis (all the indices are normalized between 0 and 1, with 0 corresponding to the least reformed and 1 to the most reformed) in the following eight sectors (or
areas) – (i) domestic financial, (ii) capital account, (iii) product markets (electricity and telecommunications), (iv) agriculture, (v) labor, (vi) trade (based on tariffs) and
(vii) current account transactions. The country codes and groups used in this figures are described in Tables A2 and A3.

Table 1.
Reform Indicators
Financial sector

The index of domestic financial liberalization is an average of six subindices, five related to banking and one related to
the securities market.
Banking

Securities market

Data sources
Coverage

The banking subindex is an average of the following 5 indicators: (i) interest rate controls, such as floors or ceilings; (ii)
credit controls, such as directed credit and subsidized lending; (iii) competition restrictions, such as limits on branches
and entry barriers in the banking sector, including licensing requirements or limits on foreign banks; (iv) the degree of
state ownership; and (v) the quality of banking supervision and regulation, including power of independence of bank
supervisors, adoption of Basel capital standards, and a framework for bank inspections.
The sixth subindex relates to securities markets and covers policies to develop domestic bond and equity markets, including
(i) the creation of basic frameworks such as the auctioning of T-bills, or the establishment of a security commission; (ii)
policies to further establish securities markets such as tax exemptions, introduction of medium- and long-term
government bonds to establish a benchmark for the yield curve, or the introduction of a primary dealer system; (iii)
policies to develop derivative markets or to create an institutional investor’s base; and (iv) policies to permit access to the
domestic stock market by nonresidents. The subindices are aggregated with equal weights. Each subindex is coded from
zero (fully repressed) to three (fully liberalized).
Abiad and others (2008), following the methodology in Abiad and Mody (2005), based on various IMF reports and
working papers, central bank websites, and others.
1973–2005; Minimum and maximum number of countries in any year are 72 and 91 respectively.

Capital account

Data sources
Coverage

Qualitative indicators of restrictions on financial credits and personal capital transactions of residents and financial
credits to nonresidents, as well as the use of multiple exchange rates. Index coded from zero (fully repressed) to three
(fully liberalized).
Abiad and others (2008), following the methodology in Abiad and Mody (2005), based on various IMF reports and
working papers, central bank websites, and others.
1973–2005; Minimum and maximum number of countries in any year are 72 and 91 respectively.

Product markets

Electricity

The electricity indicators capture (i) the degree of unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) whether
a regulator other than government has been established; and (iii) whether the wholesale market has been liberalized; and
(iv) privatization. Each subindex is coded from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 2.

29

Telecommunication
Data sources
Coverage

The telecommunication indicator captures (i) the degree of competition in local services; (ii) whether a regulator other
than government has been established; (iii) the degree of liberalization of interconnection changes; and (iv) privatization.
Each subindex is coded from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 2.
Electricity: Based on various existing studies and datasets as well as national legislation and other official documents.
Telecommunication: Based on IMF commodities data, various existing studies and datasets, and national legislation and
other official documents.
1960–2003; Minimum and maximum number of countries in any year are 106 and 108 respectively.

Agriculture market

Data sources
Coverage

The index captures intervention in the market for the main agricultural export commodity in each country. The index
can take four values (i) zero (public monopoly or monopsony in production, transportation, or marketing, e.g., export
marketing boards); (ii) one-third (administered prices); (iii) two-thirds (public ownership of relevant producers or
concession requirements); and (iv) one (no public intervention).
Based on IMF commodities data, various existing studies and datasets, and national legislation and other official
documents.
1960–2003; Minimum and maximum number of countries in any year are 96 and 104 respectively.

Trade

Data sources
Coverage

Trade liberalization is defined by looking at average tariff rates, with missing values extrapolated using implicit weighted
tariff rates. Index normalized to be between zero and unity: zero means the tariff rates are 60 percent or higher, while
unity means the tariff rates are zero.
Various sources, including IMF, World Bank, WTO, UN, Clemens and Willamson, 2004.
1960-2005; Minimum and maximum # of countries in any year are 47 and 142 respectively.

Current account

Data sources
Coverage

Current account liberalization is defined with an indicator describing how compliant a government is with its obligations
under the IMF’s Article VIII to free from government restriction the proceeds from international trade in goods and
services. The index represents the sum of two subcomponents, dealing with restrictions on trade in visibles, as well as in
invisibles (financial and other services). It distinguishes between restrictions on residents (receipts for exports) and on
nonresidents (payments for imports). Although the index measures restrictions on the proceeds from transactions,
rather than on the underlying transactions, many countries in practice use restrictions on trade proceeds as a type of
trade restriction. The index is scored between zero and 8 in half-integer units, with 8 indicating full compliance.
Based on the methodology in Quinn (1997) and Quinn and Toyoda (2007), drawing on information contained in the
Fund's AREAER database (Annual Reports on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions).
1960–2005; Minimum and maximum number of countries in any year are 50 and 65 respectively.

This table presents brief description of the reform indicators used in the paper. For a full description of all variables, data and sources refer to IMF (2008).

in Panel B control for one year lags of the following: indicators of crisis, real devaluation, tertiary enrollment, democracy in political neighbors, and log of per capita income.
Standard errors are denoted in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent respectively.

Note. The estimators are within estimators and allow for first-order autoregressive disturbance term. All regressions control for country and year fixed effects. Political reform is a
dummy variable taking a value of 1 in the years after democratization. Democratization is defined as the event of becoming a democracy (and staying as a democracy for at least 4 years),
given that a country was not a democracy in the previous year. The economic reform variable in Panel B, column (1), is measured at the country-year level, by averaging across all sectors
. Standard errors are denoted in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent respectively.

Notes. The missing values for intermediate years have been interpolate to apply the unit root tests. All reported values are distributed N(0,1) under null of unit root or no cointegration. Large negative
values imply rejection of the unit root, with the 5% and 10% critical values being -1.64 and 1.28 respectively.
