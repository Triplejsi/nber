Education and the Quality of Government

NBER Working Paper No. 18119
June 2012
JEL No. D73,D78,O43
ABSTRACT
Generally speaking, better educated countries have better governments, an empirical regularity that
holds in both dictatorships and democracies. We suggest that a possible reason for this fact is that
educated people are more likely to complain about misconduct by government officials, so that, even
when each complaint is unlikely to succeed, more frequent complaints encourage better behavior from
officials. Newly assembled individual-level survey data from the World Justice Project show that,
within countries, better educated people are more likely to report official misconduct. The results are
confirmed using other survey data on reporting crime and corruption. Citizen complaints might thus
be an operative mechanism that explains the link between education and the quality of government.

I. Introduction
Just about every measure that might be used to define the quality of government, such as
the degree of democracy, political freedom, respect for property rights, absence of corruption, or
efficiency in the provision of public services, is higher in richer and more educated countries
(see, e.g., La Porta et al 1999, Barro 1999, Treisman 2000, Svensson 2005). Figure 1 illustrates
some well-known correlations between education and the quality of government. The positive
correlation between education (or per capita income) and the quality of government holds in both
dictatorships and democracies (Figure 2).

It also holds in countries with different legal

traditions, ethnic heterogeneity, and inequality (La Porta et al. 1999).

Most studies find that

education and development lead to improved government (e.g., Barro 1999, Glaeser et al. 2004,
Bobba and Coviello 2007, Castello-Climent 2008, Murtin and Wacziarg 2011), although some
disagree (Acemoglu et al. 2005). In this paper, we ask why the quality of government improves
with education and development, assuming that it does.
The answer to the question is not entirely obvious. Take the case of corruption. The
decline in corruption as countries get richer and more educated is nearly universal (Treisman
2000, Svensson 2005; Figure 1). It occurs in both dictatorships and democracies (Figure 2), so it
is implausible that corruption falls only because voters turn out the corrupt politicians.
Corruption falls regardless of whether a country has an anti-corruption campaign, pays efficiency
wages to bureaucrats, is ethnically divided, or has free press. Theoretically, as a country grows,
both government regulation and the scale of economic activity rise, which if anything should
stimulate corruption.

The mechanisms of improvement in the quality of government as

countries develop appear to be too universal to attribute them to the particular policies.

2

We propose and test empirically a new explanation of such improvement in the process
of development, one based on educational attainment as the driving mechanism. In our view,
one reason why government improves is citizen complaints against public officials who mistreat
them: policemen who beat them up, officials who demand bribes, teachers who do not show up.
All countries have some laws against police abuse, corruption, and public employee absenteeism,
which include penalties for official misconduct. Of course, in many countries these rules are
enforced with only a small probability. But a public official choosing to break rules must trade
off the risk of being disciplined, no matter how small for each individual complaint, against the
benefits of misconduct. As citizen complaints proliferate and become more effective, the risk of
an investigation and disciplinary action rises. We propose that educated people are more likely
to complain against official misconduct, and to complain more effectively. As education levels
in a country rise, so do complaints when officials misbehave, raising the expected costs of
misconduct and thus encouraging officials to follow the rules – to ask for fewer bribes, to avoid
abusing people, to show up to work. Through this entirely decentralized process, only roughly
dependent on the prevailing political mechanisms, government improves.
The idea that citizen “voice” can improve government performance is Hirschman’s
(1970). Hirschman focuses on voting rather than complaints as the expression of voice, and does
not link voice to education. Verba and Nie (1972) and Verba, Schlozman and Brady (1995) are
among the first prominent studies in political science linking education to political participation.
These studies consider both voting and other form of participating, such as volunteering. Dee
(2004) and Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopoulus (2004) provide evidence of causal links between
education and voting. Voting is surely important, but the fact that the quality of government
improves with education in dictatorships as well as in democracies is an indication that voting is

3

not the only mechanism linking the two. With respect to the complaining mechanism, Soares
(2004a, b) finds that richer and more educated countries report a higher fraction of crimes.
Related findings are presented in DiTella et al. (2010). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, the
idea that citizen complaints about government are the route to its improvement is new here.
This discussion raises the question of why the more educated people are more likely to
complain, and to complain more effectively.

There are at least three possibilities.

First,

educated people might merely know better how to complain effectively: they are more literate,
more articulate, more knowledgeable where to go and how to complain. This is a pure human
capital channel: complaining is like any other activity for which productivity rises with
education. Verba and Nie (1972), Verba, Scholzman, and Berry (1995), and Nie, Junn, and
Stehlik-Berry (1996) take this point of view with respect to political participation. A second
channel is that educated people are more pro-social, share common values, and are less tolerant
of injustice (Dewey 1944, Hayek 1960, Putnam 1993, Campbell 2006, Glaeser, Ponzetto, and
Shleifer 2007, Algan et al. 2011). Because better educated people are better socialized, they are
more willing to complain against public misconduct even when the odds of private success are
low. A third channel, intimately related to the first, sees educated people as less fearful of
official reprisals. This might be in part because they know the law and the rules, and hence can
stand up to officials, but it might also be because they are themselves “legal” -- work formally,
occupy their residence formally – and hence do not feel at risk.
An alternative but related view holds that it is the levels of income per se, rather than
education, that drive complaints and through them governmental improvement. For example,
richer people might be able to hire lawyers, or even to find time, to make their complaints more
effective (on the other hand, their time is more valuable, so they might not bother). Wolfinger

4

and Rosenstone (1980) show empirically that education is more important than income as a
determinant of political participation. One can perhaps also argue that it is not the complaining
process, but rather the improvement in the education and the general quality of bureaucrats that
leads to better government in richer countries. In our empirical work, we seek to distinguish
between income and education as drivers of complaints.
To organize the discussion, in the next section we present a simple model of equilibrium
quality of government driven by citizen complaints.

The following sections test the main

assumption of the model, namely that better education citizens are more likely to complain. Our
main data source is the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index [Agrast et. al. 2011]. Over the
last three years, the WJP has conducted extensive surveys of both citizens and legal professionals
in 61 countries about individuals’ experiences with the law (Appendix A presents the list of
countries covered by the WJP).

The countries were selected to ensure diversity and

representation of all regions, income levels, population sizes, and legal traditions of the world.
One part of the data contains surveys of the general population (1,000 respondents per country)
eliciting both their opinions about the legal system and personal experience with it. Care was
taken to assure broad representation by gender, education level, and socio-economic status. The
data contain information about the demographic characteristics of the respondents, including
their education. In this paper, we only use experience-based questions.
The principal questions from the WJP survey we focus on deal with official misconduct
and whether it was reported by the victim. There are two main questions in the survey. The first
asks whether people have complained about some aspect of government services in general
during the previous year. The second question asks whether respondents experienced police
abuse, and if so whether they reported it. In addition, the WJP survey contains information about

5

respondents reporting crime, specifically break-ins and armed robberies.

Although these

questions do not pertain to complaints about public misconduct per se, they do give us
information about the propensity to report problems to the government, and thus shed light on
the relationship between education and voice.
We supplement WJP data with some questions from the International Crime Victims
Survey (ICVS), which contains information about households’ experiences with crime, including
reporting to the police for thousands of respondents in 78 countries. The ICVS contains a
number of questions concerning the reporting of crime, which enable us to assess the robustness
of our WJP findings on reporting using different data. In addition, on a few questions, the ICVS
asks the respondents the reasons for reporting or not reporting the incidents of crime and
corruption, and we can use these data.

We also use the Corruption Barometer from

Transparency International to examine the incidence of corruption, its reporting, and the reasons
for reporting or not reporting, in a number of countries.
Our main findings can be easily summarized.

First, the cross-country relationship

between education and institutional quality holds in our data as well. Second, we find consistent
support for the proposition that, within countries, the more educated people complain more both
about government misconduct when it occurs, and crime in general.

This relationship is

particularly strong in developing countries, consistent with the view that, in the developed
countries, even the less educated have the knowledge and lack of fear to complain. Third, the
results are particularly strong in autocracies, suggesting that voting might not be the only
important exercise of voice in the political process. Fourth, the results are robust to the inclusion
of respondent-level measures of trust, income, and social status. Fifth, the analysis of additional
data sets confirms our main findings, but also suggests that fear of police reprisals and the lack of

6

knowledge of how to complaint are important factors behind silence.

Sixth, we find that

educated countries have a lower incidence of public and private misconduct. These results are
consistent with the central assumption of the theory, as well as with its aggregate implications.

II. A Simple Model
The players in the model are a citizen, an official, the official’s superior, and possibly
also the superior’s manager. The citizen has an interaction, or a possible interaction, with the
official, who chooses whether to do his job. The official can be a doctor deciding whether to pay
attention to the patient’s complaint, a teacher deciding whether to go to work that day, a
policeman considering whether to beat up a citizen he does not like, or a bureaucrat deciding
whether to ask for a bribe. We assume that the benefit to the official of misbehaving is b, which
is distributed as F(b) in the population of officials.
In case the official misbehaves, the citizen can complain to the official’s superior.

Let

the probability of complaint be p(e,s), where e is the citizen’s education, and s is the probability
of success. We assume for simplicity that e is known to the official, which can be interpreted
either as citizen’s education known to the official or as average education in the country (so the
official does not know whom he is dealing with).

We assume that p1 > 0 and p2 > 0.

The

probability of success will be determined in equilibrium.
Begin with the simplest version of the model. The official’s superior is honest with an
exogenous probability h, and punishes the official upon receiving the complaint if and only if he
is honest. The punishment is exogenously given by D. In this case, the equilibrium probability
that the complaint succeeds is s = h, and the overall probability of punishment is p(e,h)h. In this
case, the official misbehaves provided that b > p(e,h)hD. Letting b* be the cutoff benefit level

7

for misbehavior, we can think of F(b*) as the share of officials who behave, and therefore the
quality of government in the country. It is trivial to show that this quality rises with the
probability that the superior is honest but also with e, the level of education of the citizen(s).
Intuitively, citizen complaints discourage misbehavior, and thus improve institutional quality. If
one makes the additional assumption that h – the “quality” of officials -- rises with e, there is a
further reason why the quality of government rises with e as well.
We can extend the model slightly and assume that if the superior ignores the complaint,
the citizen can complain about him to his manager, who responds with the same exogenous
probability h upon receiving a complaint. This means that even a dishonest superior with a low
enough cost of acting might punish the official, so the total probability of success of a complaint
s is now given by h + (1-h)P(e,h), where P(e,h) is the equilibrium probability that the dishonest
superior punishes the official in fear of his own punishment. Higher citizen education thus
provides an extra incentive for the official to behave, because he knows that even a dishonest
superior might punish him in fear of continuing complaints, and possible action, up the chain.
Solving backwards, we can compute the equilibrium b** > b* such that the officials with b <
b** now behave. The quality of institutions, F(b**) is even higher in this case, and it remains
the case, with an extra kick, that the quality of institutions rises with education.
In summary, even this very simple analysis suggests three potential channels through
which the complaint mechanism works. Government officials are more likely to do their job
when citizens are better educated because 1) such citizens are more likely to complain, leading to
a higher probability of punishment for misconduct, 2) the officials’ superiors are more likely to
act and punish misbehaving officials because they themselves are more vulnerable to citizen
complaints up the chain of command and therefore to punishment for inaction in response to

8

complaints, and 3) better educated officials might perhaps be more honest.

In our micro

regressions, we do not disentangle these mechanisms, but test the fundamental assumption of the
model, namely that better educated citizens are more likely to complain about official
misconduct. We also examine the aggregate implications of the theory across countries.

III. Data
We use data on citizen complaints and reporting from the general population polls of the
World Justice Project Rule of Law Index. Over the last three years, WJP has conducted extensive
surveys in 61 countries of the perceptions and experiences of ordinary people concerning their
dealings with the government, the police, and the courts; the extent of corruption; as well as the
magnitude of common crimes to which the general public is exposed. The surveys were carried
in two waves, 2009 and 2011, on probability samples of 1,000 respondents drawn from the three
largest cities in each country, and were conducted by professional polling organizations using
face-to-face, telephone, and online interviews. All questions we use deal with personal
experiences of individuals or their families.
Our basic measures of citizen complaints against public officials come from two
questions. The first question, available only in the 2011 wave, is worded as follows: “During the
last year, did you submit any complaint about the services provided by the different government
agencies in your country (including registration office; customs office; public health services;
tax office; land allocation office, etc.)?” The second question asks whether respondents
experienced police abuse, and if so whether they reported it. The question reads “In the last 3
years, have you or someone in your household, been subjected to physical abuse by the police or

9

the military?” and is followed by the question “Did you or anyone else report the crime to the
police or other authority?”
The WJP polls also ask respondents whether they were victim of crime during the last
three years and whether they reported it to the police. We use two of these questions. The first
question is: “In the past 3 years, did anyone actually break into your home/residence without
permission, and steal or try to steal something?” and “Did you or anyone else report the crime to
the police”. The second question asks: “In the past 3 years, were you a victim of an armed
robbery (with a weapon such as a knife or a gun)?” and “Did you or anyone else report the
crime to the police?” This question was only asked in the 2011 wave.
The WJP data also contain demographic information, including education and income.
We construct two indicators of education level: College and High/Middle school. The first
indicator equals 1 if the respondent answered “Bachelor's degree” or “Graduate degree (Masters,
Ph.D.)” to the question “What is the highest degree you received?” The second indicator is coded
1 if the respondent answered “Middle school diploma” or “High school diploma or equivalent”.
We supplement the WJP data with information from the International Crime Victims
Survey (ICVS) and the 2009 TI Global Corruption Barometer. The ICVS is an international poll
designed to provide comparable data on people’s recent experience with common crime around
the world. By 2005, over 140 surveys had been completed in 75 different countries, totaling
over 320,000 individual respondents. We construct a sample using the most recent data for each
country and focus on two groups of questions. The first group asks respondents whether they
have experienced burglary, attempted burglary, robbery, fraud, and personal theft; and whether
the crime was reported to the police. The second group asks whether respondents have been
solicited for bribes in the previous year, whether they reported the incident, as well as the reasons

10

for reporting or not reporting it. The ICVS includes demographic characteristics, but education
is not consistently asked throughout the different waves. Accordingly, we define college by the
highest degree attained, the years of schooling (more than 15) or if the respondent completed
school when he/she was older than 21 years. Similarly, we define High/Middle school if the
respondent finished Middle or High school, have between 9 and 15 years of schooling, or
completed school when he/she was between 15 and 21 years old.
The TI Global Corruption Barometer is a worldwide public opinion survey on the general
public’s views and experiences of corruption. Each country sample is probabilistic and is
weighted to provide a representative sample of the national population. We use three questions
from the 2009 wave, which covers 69 countries: “On the past 12 months, have you or anyone
living in your household paid a bribe in any form?” and the follow up questions “Did you
present a formal complaint in this regard?” and “Why you did not present the complaint?”
Table 1 presents the definitions of the variables from WJP and the supplementary sources
used in the analysis. Figure 3 confirms that the cross-country relationship between education
and institutional quality holds in the WJP data as well. Figure 3 shows that the value of WJP’s
aggregate rule of law index rises sharply with a country’s level of educational attainment.

IV. Evidence
In this section, we focus on the relationship between education and the reporting of
government misconduct or crime at the individual level, holding country fixed effects constant.
Table 2 contains results for 7 questions from the WJP database.

Four questions were

administered in 61 countries, for a total of about 61,000 observations. The remaining questions
were asked in only 31 countries. The first three questions deal with reporting government

11

misconduct; the last four deal with reporting crime. For each individual in the survey we have
information of whether he or she is a college graduate, a high school graduate, or has less than
high school education. All the results are estimated using OLS with country fixed effects and
standard errors clustered at the country level. The dependent variables are dummies equal to
zero or one depending on whether a particular event occurred.
The first question asks whether the respondent submitted a complaint about services
provided by any government agency during the past year. Compared to individuals with less
than a high school degree, college graduates are 4.5 percentage points more likely to have
submitted a complaint (t = 3.47), while high school graduates are 2.2 percentage points more
likely to have submitted a complaint (t = 1.61).

These are large effects compared to the

worldwide complaining mean of 13.6 percent. The second question asks whether, during the last
three years, the respondent or someone in their household has been unfairly subjected to physical
abuse by the police or the military. There is a reduction in the likelihood of abuse for college
and high-school graduates, but the effects are not statistically significant. Critically for our
study, the next question asks the 3,614 individuals in the WJP survey who had been victimized
whether they had reported the abuse. Here we find a sharply higher and statistically significant
probability of reporting (compared to the 44 percentage point world mean) among college and
high school graduates. Compared to respondents with less than high school education, college
graduates are 13.0 percentage points more likely to report abuse, and high school graduates are
5.1 percentage points more likely. The data on reporting government misconduct from WJP
suggest that education is associated with a sharply higher probability of complaining.
The remaining four questions in Table 2 deal with reporting crime. The evidence shows
that the more educated people are, if anything, more likely to experience break-ins and armed

12

robberies than the less educated ones. At the same time, better educated crime victims were
much more likely to report the crime. Relative to the world-wide mean of 61 percent of
reporting break-ins, college graduates were 9.6 percentage points more likely, and high school
graduates 4.7 percentage points more likely to report than those without a high school degree.
Relative to the world-wide mean of 58 percent reporting armed robberies, college graduates were
9.8 percentage points more likely, but high school graduates no more likely, to report than those
without a high school degree.

The effect of education, particularly college education, on

reporting crime is huge.
Table 3 examines the robustness of these results for educated and uneducated countries in
the sample. The results are extremely strong in uneducated countries. In these countries, for
example, a person with a college education is 6 percentage points more likely (compared to a
mean of 13.2) to complain about government services, and 14.2 percentage points more likely
(compared to a mean of 44.1) to report police abuse, than a person without a high school degree.
The results are not as strong for the educated countries. There is no effect of education at all for
complaints about government services, although there is a positive but insignificant effect of
education on reporting police abuse. This evidence is consistent with our expectations.

The

uneducated people in uneducated countries might indeed not know how to complain, or be
fearful of the authorities (see the evidence described below). In educated countries, in contrast,
the knowledge of how to address government misconduct is more widespread, and there is less
fear of reprisal. As a consequence, the relationship between education and complaints is not
nearly as clear cut, either theoretically or empirically, as that in uneducated countries.
The next series of tables examines the robustness of the results. Table 4 distinguishes
autocracies and democracies.

The results hold very strongly in both autocracies and

13

democracies, consistently for complaining about government officials, reporting police abuse, as
well as reporting crime. The fact that the results hold strongly in autocracies is important. It
suggests that it might not be only the voting mechanism stressed by Hirschman and Verba, but
also the decentralized process of individuals complaining against government misconduct, that
serves to discipline government officials and improve institutional quality as countries develop.
An important question about our finding is whether education is a proxy for something
else that may encourage complaining. The leading possibilities are 1) trust or social capital, 2)
income, and 3) social status. More trusting people may have greater confidence that their
complaints would be addressed fairly, richer people may have greater resources to complain and
perhaps greater sums to complain about, and higher status people may feel more empowered to
complain. Fortunately, WJP data contain some information on each of these matters, so the
concerns can be addressed empirically.
Several of the respondent-level questions asked in the WJP survey concern the level of
trust in institutions, and we aggregate them into an index. The results in Table 5 do not offer
consistent evidence that trust matters for complaining, while education coefficients remain both
sizable and statistically significant. Education is not merely a proxy for trust in these data.
Table 6 uses a proxy for respondent’s income to assess whether it is income rather than
education that influences complaining. Higher income individuals are more likely to report
burglary, but not to complain more in other respects. We find no significant changes in the
estimated effects of education from including income proxies (we have tried other specifications
to check robustness). Education is not merely a proxy for income in these data.
As a rough proxy for social status as distinct from income, we included an indicator of
whether the respondent owns a car. As Table 7 shows, car ownership increases the probability of

14

reporting crime, but not of complaining about the government (we have also checked the effects
of ownership of a second home, which are not significant). The effects of education remain large
and significant. An alternative view is that social status is related to gender. In WJP data, men
report a higher probability of complaining about officials, and higher probabilities of being
victimized, but not higher incidence of reporting crime.

These effects of gender do not,

however, reduce the coefficients on education (results not reported).

We have also checked

whether religion influences the probability of complaining, and found no evidence that it does.
Another concern is that the propensity to complain is shaped by access to the complaint
technology, such as a cell phone or a computer, rather than by education per se.

Fortunately,

WJP data contain information on whether the respondent has a cell phone or a computer. Table
8 shows that, indeed, having a cell phone sharply raises the probability of reporting a crime,
though not of complaining about government generally. At the same time, having a cell phone
does not have much of an effect on education coefficients. (There is also no evidence of
complementarities between education and cell phones.) We do not find that having a computer
affects the probability of complaining or reporting a crime (results not reported). The evidence
suggests that cell phones do indeed facilitate crime reporting, but education is by no means a
proxy for having a cell phone.

IV. Other Data Sources.
The next series of tables examine the robustness of our results in other data sources, and
probe the reasons for reporting on not reporting government misconduct and crime. Table 9
reports, for a sample of 125,000 observations from 71 countries, that the incidence of reporting

15

burglary, attempted burglary, robbery, consumer fraud, and theft was sharply higher for better
educated individuals. Across specifications, the results confirm the findings in the WJP data.
Table 10 focuses on ICVS data on corruption, and the reasons for reporting and not
reporting requests for bribes. The first column shows, not surprisingly, that better educated
people are more likely to be asked for a bribe. The next two columns show that educated people
are not more likely to report the request for a bribe to the police, but more likely to report it to a
public or private agency. In explaining the reasons for not reporting, the educated people are less
likely to report that the matter was inappropriate for police, but also less likely to worry that the
police will not do anything or to fear/dislike police. There is evidence here that the less educated
people are more concerned with police reprisals, and hence fail to use their voice. In the final
panel of Table 10, we examine affirmative reasons in ICVS for reporting corruption, but do not
find any interesting and statistically significant effects.
Table 11 deals with the data from the TI Global Corruption Barometer 2009 produced by
Transparency International. The sample is over 60,000 people from 62 countries. As with
ICVS, educated people report much higher probabilities of being asked for a bribe: 4.3
percentage points higher for a college graduate than for a person with no high school education
(compared to a mean of 17.7 percent). There is also strong evidence of college graduates being
more likely to present a formal complaint against being asked for a bribe: with a world-wide
average probability of a complaint of 19.8 percent, college graduates are 2.4 percentage points
more likely to file a complaint. With respect to reasons for not reporting corruption requests, the
evidence here is again considerably stronger than with ICVS. College graduates were 6.1
percentage points less likely to report that they did not know how to file a complaint as the
reason for not doing so than individuals without a high school education (the mean of this

16

variable is 16 percent). They are also more likely to report that it would not have helped. Last,
they are 3.2 percentage points less likely to report a fear of reprisals (the mean of this variable is
21.8 percent). The evidence points to a combination of the pure human capital story whereby the
more educated people know how to complain, and a related story that these people do not fear
the police. The Corruption Barometer evidence is broadly consistent with our basic theory.
Yiqing Xu (2012) re-examines our hypotheses using the data set of complaints against
provincial and local government officials in China, using the China Public Governance Survey.
He finds that in the Chinese data as well, better educated citizens are more likely to complain
about both government misconduct and public services.

Xu finds even larger effects of

education than we do. He also finds that the reasons for higher complaints by the better educated
include greater knowledge, greater civicness, and lower fear of reprisals. Xu’s evidence strongly
reinforces our hypothesis that the complaint mechanism of institutional improvement is of
particular importance in non-democratic countries.
As a final step, we check whether higher education countries have lower rates of
victimization of citizens by criminals and government officials. Figure 4 summarizes these
findings, and confirms this basic aggregate prediction of the theory, namely that higher education
countries have lower crime and better government performance. This particular prediction, of
course is not new: it is the within-country mechanism that represents this paper’s innovation.

V. Conclusion
We have proposed a new explanation of the universal positive association between a
country’s educational level and the quality of its government, namely citizen complaints. We
argued that educated citizens complain more, and that these complaints lead to better conduct by

17

officials fearful of being punished, and therefore a higher quality government. One attractive
feature of this mechanism is that it is entirely decentralized, and does not rely on any particular
institution, such as democracy. The evidence from a newly collected data set and two additional
ones indeed suggests that within countries better educated citizens are more likely to complain
both about crime and about government misconduct, such as corruption and police abuse.

Description
1. Cross-country variables

Education

The expected number of years of schooling, or school life expectancy (SLE). It is defined as the total number of years of schooling which a child can
expect to receive, assuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any particular future age is equal to the current enrolment ratio at
that age. It is a synthetic summary indicator of the overall pattern of enrolment ratios at one particular point in time, and has no predictive value except in
so far as it is believed that enrolment patterns will remain unchanged into the future. Source: http://unstats.un.org

Transparency
International
Corruption
Perceptions Index

The score of the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index in 2010. The index provides a measure of the extent to which corruption is
perceived to exist in the public and political sectors. The index focuses on corruption in the public sector and defines corruption as the abuse of public
office for private gain. It is based on assessments by experts and opinion surveys. The index ranges between 0 (highly corrupt) and 10 (highly clean).

World Bank
Governance
Indicators

The averaged score of the Worldwide Governance Indicators 2010 (WGI). The WGI 2010 reports aggregate and individual governance indicators for 213
economies for six dimensions of governance: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness,
Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. The individual data sources underlying the aggregate indicators are drawn from a diverse
variety of survey institutes, think tanks, NGOs, and international organizations. Source: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/

Heritage Economic
Freedom Index

The score of the Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom in 2011. The index measures ten components of economic freedom, assigning a grade
in each using a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the maximum freedom. The ten component scores are then averaged to give an overall
economic freedom score for each country. The ten components of economic freedom are: Business Freedom, Trade Freedom, Fiscal Freedom,
Government Spending, Monetary Freedom, Investment Freedom, Financial Freedom, Property rights, Freedom from Corruption, and Labor Freedom

Democracy

An indicator variable coded 1 if the Polity 2 score from the 2010 Polity IV data set is below 0. The Polity2 score is computed by subtracting a county's
autocracy score from its democracy score. The resulting unified polity scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic).

WGI- Government
Effectiveness
Estimate

The score of the Worldwide Governance Indicator 'Government Effectiveness' 2010, which captures perceptions of the quality of public services, the
quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the
credibility of the government's commitment to such policies. Source: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/

WJP Rule of Law
Index

The WJP Rule of Law Index is the average of the eight factors of the Rule of Law Index measured in 2011: Limited Government Powers, Corruption,
Order and Security, Fundamental Rights, Open Government, Effective Regulatory enforcement, Access to Civil Justice, Effective Criminal Justice. Scores
range between 0 and 1, with 1 representing a higher adherence to the rule of law. Source: http://www.worldjusticeproject.org
