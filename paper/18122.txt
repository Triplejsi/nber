ABSTRACT
The ‚Äúborder effect‚Äù literature finds that political borders have a very large impact on relative prices,
implicitly adding several thousands of miles to trade. In this paper we show that the standard empirical
specification suffers from selection bias, and propose a new methodology based on quantile regressions.
Using a novel data set from Uruguay, we apply our procedure to measure the segmentation introduced
by city borders. City borders should matter little for trade. We find that when the standard methodology
is used, two supermarkets separated by 10 kilometers across two different cities have the same price
dispersion as two supermarkets separated by 30 kilometers within the same city; so the city border
triples the distance. When our methodology is used, the city border effect becomes insignificant. We
further test our methodology using online prices for the largest supermarket chain in the country, and
show that the ‚Äúonline border‚Äù is equivalent to the average distance from the online warehouse to each
of the offline stores.

1 Introduction
Political borders can have a signicant impact on relative prices. The degree of price segmentation caused by such boundaries was empirically documented in a seminal paper by Engel
and Rogers (1996), who showed with CPI data that the USCanadian border had an eect
on price dispersion equivalent to adding a distance of at least 1,780 miles between locations
(approximately the distance between Miami and Quebec). Their work spurred a large literature that found similarly large border eects across countries, states, and even cities.

1

These results have been heavily debated over the years. Some papers have argued that (i)
the distances have been mis-measured (see Head and Mayer (2002)), (ii) the regressions
suer from aggregation bias (see Evans (2003) and Broda and Weinstein (2008)), (iii) the
gravity equation implied in the standard specication has been misspecied (see Anderson
and van Wincoop (2003) and Hillberry and Hummels (2003)), and that (iv) the regressions
do not have a proper benchmark due to the fact that country distributions of prices are very
dierent across countries (see Gorodnichenko and Tesar (2009)). Despite all this work, the
magnitude and reasons behind the segmentation introduced by political borders is still an
open question in the literature.

In this paper we propose a simple method to estimate the size of the border eect based
on Samuelson's iceberg cost model. This methodology imply that largest price dierences
observed between locations are relevant for transport cost estimation. We rst argue that the
standard regression is based on an arbitrage inequality constraint, and that using all price
observations creates a selection bias that aects both the distance and border coecients (and
therefore the estimates of the border eect). We propose an alternative approach based on
quantile regressions that corrects for the selection bias while simultaneously controlling for

for the eects of provincial borders in Canada.

potential measurement errors.

Our method can be explained using a very simple framework along the lines of Engel and
Rogers (1996). Consider the problem of a rm that sets a price bounded by the existence of
an arbitrage constraint. If the arbitrage cost between two establishments (i and

p

j)

is

œÑ,

and

denotes the log price in each location, then the arbitrage constraint can be expressed as a

simple inequality:

|pi ‚àí pj | ‚â§ œÑ
where

œÑ

(1)

is a function of distance, political boundaries, and other regional and product

characteristics. The literature typically estimates

œÑ

and the border eects by running the

following regression on price dispersion:

|pi,t ‚àí pj,t | = Œ± + Œ≤Di,j + Œ≥Bi,j + Œ¥Xi,j,t + i,j,t

where

number of miles that would produce the same dispersion as the estimated border dummy
coecient

Œ≥.

In its simplest form, it is the ratio

Œ≥/Œ≤ ,

which means that a bias in either (or

both) of these coecients will have an impact on the estimate of the border eect.

We argue that

œÑ

and its determinants cannot be estimated through a simple OLS re-

gression because prices in the two locations are an optimal choice subject to an inequality

deviation

œÉ (pi,t ‚àí pj,t )

instead. In both cases, the objective is to measure the eect of the righ-hand side

variables on price dispersion, which can be done either through the mean of the absolute value or the standard
deviation of the price dierences. Our results do not change if we use the standard deviation. See Broda
and Weinstein (2008) for an overview of the papers that use these two regressions in the literature.

constraint that is not necessarily binding. If the optimal prices of the two stores lie within
the constraint, then their dierence is smaller than

œÑ

and these observations are not rele-

vant to estimate the arbitrage costs. To illustrate this, consider two markets that are highly
segmented but have identical supply and demand characteristics. Goods will have the same
price across the two locations, but this price gap tells us nothing about the arbitrage costs
or the degree of segmentation between the markets. In fact, all observations within the noarbitrage range suer from selection bias, and estimates that use the mean or the standard
deviation of

|p1 ‚àí p2 |

will be biased downward as well.

The arbitrage cost

œÑ

is better estimated when we use only the largest observed price

dierences between locations.

Those are the observations that provide information about

the limit that arbitrage imposes of the magnitude of price dispersion.

3

Ideally we would

like to use the maximum observed price gap between locations, but it is potentially sensitive
to measurement errors.

4

Instead, we estimate a series of binned-quantile regressions that

allow us to measure the sensitivity of our estimates to the errors-in-variables.

We start

with the mean price gap between locations (equivalent to the method typically used in the
literature), and then use only the observations in the 80th, 90th, 95th, 99th percentiles, and
the maximum observed price dierence.

We apply this method to study the impact of city borders on price dispersion in Uruguay.
We use a novel good-level dataset composed by daily prices from 202 UPC-level products
sold in 333 supermarkets across 47 cities collected between 2007 and 2010. When we rst
estimate the border eect using standard methods, we nd that the city border between two

3 The estimation problem is analogous to estimating using inequality moments as opposed to equality moments. This area has received signicant attention recently. See for example Andrews, Berry, and Jia (2004),
Andrews and Guggenberger (2009), Andrews and Soares (2010), Andrews and Shi (2014), Ponomareva and
Tamer (2011), and Rosen (2008).

4 A related idea in the context of trade can be found in Eaton and Kortum (2002) who propose estimating

trade friction using the maximum price dierence. Simonovska and Waugh (2014) criticizes the use of the
maximum price dierence in the estimating strategies, based on the possibility of bias of the estimator on
nite samples.

stores separated by 10 kilometers is larger than 20 kilometers wide, and statistically dierent
from zero. This implies that the border triples the distance of stores across the city borders.
However when we re-estimate using distance-binned quantile regressions, the border declines
until it is not signicantly dierent from zero.

As expected from our discussion both the

distance and border dummy coecients are downward biased in the standard regression, but
the bias is largest on the distance parameter.

5

As a result, the net impact is that the implied

border eect (in kilometers) falls.

We perform robustness tests to correct for outliers, product mix, and we change the specication to include non-linearity and interaction terms. In all of them, the city-border eect
measured in kilometers tends to disappear when higher percentiles are used. Furthermore,
the results are similar at the 99th, 99.5th, 99.9th percentile, and the maximum, suggesting
that the estimates are not signicantly aected by potential errors in the data.

We further illustrate our methodology to study the dispersion between online and oine
prices.

We use daily prices collected from the website of the largest grocery retailer in

Montevideo, and compare them to the prices in all oine locations of the same retailer. The
oine store's data provide an estimate of the impact of distance on price dispersion across
locations. The online border is simply the distance that would generate the same eect on
online-oine price dispersion observed in the data. When the standard procedure is used,
online and oine markets appear to be very closely integrated, with a border eect of just
1.6 kilometers. However, when we use the 95th percentile of the price gap distribution, the
online border eect becomes 8.8 kilometers, a number close to the actual average physical
distance between the online warehouse (where the online goods are delivered from) and each
of the oine stores in the city.

6

5 The reason is that price gaps within the arbitrage constraint are less common for observations across
cities, and therefore the border coecient is less aected by the selection bias. Within cities, by contrast,
small price gaps are very frequent and can greatly bias the distance coecient.

6 The retailer's website indicates that the online prices match those of the store where the orders are

5

Our approach and the nature of the data address four additional sources of concerns that
have been raised since the original Engel-Rogers regressions. First, we use product-level data
with identical goods across all locations.

As suggested by Goldberg and Knetter (1997),

product-level data is crucial to understand deviations from the Law of One Price (LOP).
Indeed, Evans (2003) and Broda and Weinstein (2008) argue that a signicant problem in
the border eect literature is the aggregation bias induced by price indexes. Second, we use
retail prices. Hillberry and Hummels (2003) have argued that business-to-business data tends
to overestimate trade ows and to underestimate price dierences within countries. Third,
we know the exact location of each store. As pointed out by Head and Mayer (2002), using
approximate distances (such as from one country capital to another) can greatly overestimate
the border eect. Finally, all the stores in our sample sell the same set of products. As Evans
(2003) points out, the mix of products sold across borders can lead to a bias in the standard
regressions.

Compared to recent papers in the literature, our results are consistent with Gorodnichenko and Tesar (2009), who argue that with cross-country heterogeneity in the distribution of within-country price dierentials there is no clear benchmark from which to
gauge the eect of the border. We agree with this statement, but we show that even in the
absence of a structural model it is still possible to obtain a simple and reliable estimate for
the magnitude of the border eect using quantile regressions. Our paper is also complementary to the work of Gopinath, Gourinchas, Hsieh, and Li (2011) who estimate the border
eect by studying the response of average prices in one market to cost shocks in another
market. An advantage of our approach is that it does not require any cost data.
sent from, but it does not provide details on what specic store it is. In order to identify the most likely
candidate, we compared daily online prices for all products with each oine store in the city and found a
location where prices were identical 97.3 percent of the time. That location has an average distance of 7.2
kilometers to all the other stores.

2 Methodology
In this section we present a simple model of price-setting across locations that provides the
inequality we use to estimate arbitrage costs and the border eect. In particular, we propose
a model where the rms' pricing decision is constrained by the ability of the consumer
to arbitrage the price gap between two locations.

Standard OLS regressions used in the

literature consider all pairs of prices, including those that lie within the arbitrage constraint,
which introduces a bias in the estimates of factors that aect the cost to arbitrage, such as
distance and political borders. We propose an alternative methodology that focuses on the
largest observed price dierences between locations using binned-quantile regressions.

associated with the city but not driven by distance.

Comparing across dierent pairs, if the distance increases, a border exists between the
stores, or there is a positive cost of switching stores, the level of price dispersion rises. The
opposite occurs if consumers are more sensitive to prices. It can be shown that the price space
is not empty and that the inequality constraint is only binding for the marginal consumer.

8

Where the marginal consumer is traditionally dened as indierent between buying in two
dierent stores. This implies that the rest of the consumers are not indierent between two
stores and always prefer to buy on a particular one. In the end, the marginal consumer is
the one for which the inequality is binding, and denes the demand for each store.

Firms maximize prots when setting the maximum price for the marginal consumer, as
shown in Appendix A.1. This in turn implies that the inequality will not be binding for the
rest of the consumers. Therefore comparing pairs of prices for all stores to estimate equation
6 will not result in the correct measure of the consumers' parameters, as only those where
the restriction is binding are valid.

When this happens the estimation by OLS

is expected to produce biased estimates due to the failure of the orthogonality conditions,
where the bias is downward. There is only one case in which the estimates remain unbiased,
and is if the price deviations are exactly equal to the arbitrage cost i.e. the constraint is
always binding. The residuals are identical to zero and OLS produces unbiased estimates.
Intuitively prices are assumed free of errors-in-variables, so that the extreme in the distribution of price dierences is the closest estimator to the arbitrage costs.

It is important

to mention that if all prices are optimally chosen to lie within the no-arbitrage region then
even the estimation using the extreme of the price distribution will produce downward biased estimates. However by construction the biases will be smaller. Formally, the expected

value of the errors at the medium are more negative than the errors at the 95th quantile:

E [i,j,t |50th] ‚â§ E [i,j,t |95th] ‚â§ 0.

Nevertheless, as pointed out by Simonovska and Waugh

(2014) the maximum price dierence could introduce additional biases, so we use instead the
upper quintiles for our estimation.

10

Figure 1 illustrates how the observed price dispersion may not be informative of the
arbitrage cost. Panel (a) in Figure 1 shows hypothetical prices over time of one product in
two locations. If the no-arbitrage condition is binding, then as the arbitrage cost

œÑ

decreases,

so does the price dispersion. However if the condition is not binding, as shown in Panel (b),
distributional statistics such as the mean or the standard deviation will not be associated
with the estimate of
of

œÑ

œÑ.

In both cases, however, we would be able to obtain good estimates

by using only the maximum observed price dierence.

[Figure 1 here]

Figure 2 makes a similar point with real data. We plot the distribution of price dierences
for all goods between two locations of a given retailer, and compare the results for stores
located at 1 km, 10 km (same city), 10 km (dierent cities), and 20 km (dierent cities) of
each other. As expected, as the distance increases the share of price gaps at 0% falls (see
table), and the mass between 1% and 20% increases. Interestingly, when we compare the
two pairs of stores located at 10 km from each other (one of which is for stores in dierent
cities), we nd that crossing the city border has an eect on the mean and 90th percentile.
The two pairs, however, have exactly the same gaps at the 99th and 99.9th percentiles of the
distribution. This last result is consistent with the idea that city borders should not aect
the cost to arbitrage across locations. Using the mean and lower percentiles of the price gaps

10 Note that Simonovska and Waugh (2014) argues that the estimation of the transport costs can be
downward biased if the maximum price dierence is used, but we nd a monotonic increase in this parameter
as we use move from lower quintiles to the maximum price dierence.

11

that lie within the arbitrage constraint can therefore lead to biased results.

[Figure 2 here]

In order to address this selection bias, we propose a new method to estimate border eects
using distance-binned quantile regressions. The methodology can be described as follows:

First, compute the absolute price dierence for all possible location (stores) pairs. Repeat
this exercise across time and all goods, and pool all observations.

Second, dene distance-border-bins according to a discrete spacing criteria that depends
on the unit of observation (city vs countries) and the availability of enough observations
within each bin.

In the case of the city eect, stores are assigned to bins of a few miles

apart. If the unit of analysis is countries, bins should be larger to contain stores that are
separated by larger distances.

The distance in each bin does not have to be set in linear

increments. For simplicity denote each bin as
of bins. Each bin is dened by a distance
the two stores, and additional controls

In our case,

interaction term between distance and city dummy.

Third, compute the relevant quantile statistic of the absolute price dierences for each
bin. Denote the statistic as

Qn (|pi,t ‚àí pj,t |, q)

for the

q th

percentile of bin

n.

Finally, estimate the following equation:

Qn (|pi,t ‚àí pj,t |, q) = Œ± + Œ≤Dn + Œ≥Bn + Œ¥Xn + n

(8)

In Figure 3 we depict the impact of the bias and the intuition behind our methodology.
The horizontal axis shows the bins for a range of distances, and the vertical axis is the

12

absolute price dierence. The dots mark the absolute dierences in the data for each of the
selected bins. The thick black line reects the price dierence implied by the no-arbitrage
constraint. Because all the observed price dierences are less than or equal to the thick line,
the estimation in the standard regression which implicitly uses the mean within each bin
is downward biased as denoted by the red line. In small samples, the true maximum per
bin might not be observed, and therefore estimating via the sample maximum will also be
downward biased. Still, in this case the bias is smaller than using the mean. In other words,
it is possible that there is no realization on the black line, but using the maximum within
each bin gets closer to the true line. This explains why we interpret our results as a lower
bound estimate of the degree of segmentation.

[Figure 3 here]

2.3 Dealing with errors-in-variables
One of the reasons we use quantile regressions to estimate arbitrage costs, instead of only
the maximum, is to relax the assumption of no errors-in-variables (EIV). In particular, the
maximum of the price dierence distribution within each bin can be signicantly aected if
prices are mis-measured. These errors can arise either because prices are observed and/or
reported with errors, or because stores make mistakes and post prices outside the no-arbitrage
range.

When we describe our data in Section 3 it will become clear that the errors from

misreporting are very small, because of the way the data is collected. However, there is still
the possibility that the prices are incorrectly reported, and thus concentrating the estimates
on the maximum within each bin would exacerbate the impact of any errors-in-variables.

This case is depicted in Figure 4.

The black thick line is still the true upper bound

of the no-arbitrage band, that is the true degree of segmentation.

13

However due to EIV,

some price dierences might even be above the no-arbitrage range. In this case, using the
maximum within each bin also produces a bias in the estimation.

[Figure 4 here]

We address errors-in-variables in two ways. One is to eliminate outliers from the distribution. As we discuss below, the type of errors that are likely to be present in our data are
misplacement of the decimal point or ipping digits, both of which are likely to produce large
price changes at the item level that we can identify. This approach, however, does not provide a denite answer. For example, if the estimates change little then it is not clear whether
the EIV had a small impact, or not enough observations were eliminated to remove the bias.
The alternative we propose it to estimate the regression using dierent quantiles. Within
each bin we compute several quantiles the median, 80th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles.

11

The 50th and 80th percentiles are clearly less aected by the EIV than the maximum, but
those estimates will be aected by the sample selection of prices within the no-arbitrage
range. As we move towards higher percentiles, the estimates are less aected by the sample
selection, and more aected by the EIV. If the EIV is small, it should be the case that the
estimates are monotonically increasing. We evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of our
estimates in Section 4.1.

In 2006 a new tax law was passed by the Uruguayan legislature which changed the tax
base and rates of the value added tax (VAT). The Ministry of Economy and Finance was
concerned about incomplete pass-through from tax reductions to consumer prices, and hence
decided to collect and publish a dataset of prices in dierent grocery stores and supermarkets
across the country. The DGC issued Resolution Number 061/006 which mandates grocery
stores and supermarkets to report its daily prices for a list of products if they meet the
following two conditions: i) they sell more than 70% of the products listed, and ii) either
have more than four grocery stores under the same name, or have more than three cashiers
in a store. The information sent by each retailer is a sworn statement, and they are subject
to penalties in case of misreporting.

The objective of the DGC is to ensure that prices

posted reect real posted prices by stores. In this regard, stores are free to set the prices
they optimally choose, but they face a penalty only if they try to misreport them

The data includes daily prices from April 1st of 2007 to December 31th of 2010 for 202
items corresponding to 61 product categories, where each item is dened by its universal

13

product code (UPC).

The three highest-selling brands are reported for each product cate-

gory. Most items had to be homogenized in order to be comparable, and each supermarket
must always report the same item.

For example, sparkling water of the Salus" brand is

reported in its 2.25 liter variety by all stores.

If this specic variety is not available at a

store, then no price is reported. Whenever prices are 50% greater (or less) than the average
price, the retailer is contacted to conrm whether the submitted price is correct. The data
are then used in a public web site that allows consumers to check prices in dierent stores

13 The only exceptions are meat, eggs, ham, some types of cheese, and bread. However, as we later show,
the exclusion of these goods which could potentially be aected by an imperfect matching, does not modify
the results.

15

or cities and to compute the cost of dierent baskets of goods across locations.

14

After the exclusion of observations labeled as preliminary as well as wrongly categorized
or unidentied data (e.g. products that share the same UPC), our nal dataset is composed
by 202 products at the UPC level in 333 grocery stores from 47 cities. Table 1 describes the
summary statistics of the coverage in the data, and Appendix A.4 provides a detailed list
of the products. In addition, see Figure 5 for a map with the cities covered in the dataset.
These cities represent more than 80% of the total population of Uruguay. Montevideo, with
45% of the population, accounts for 58% of the supermarkets in the sample. The maximum
distance between two supermarkets is 526 kilometers.

15

We consider two datasets separately to account for outliers that may have a greater
impact on the largest price dierences between one good. A baseline case with the complete
sample, and a second case in which we exclude those prices higher than 3 times (or less than
a third) of the median daily price. However, deleted prices only account for a small 0.034%
of the whole database.

In order to compute the linear distance between each pair of stores in our sample, we use
information on the exact geographical location of each supermarket as provided by Ciudata,
an industry organization. We then construct distance bins using a geometric sequence starting from 0.1 kilometers, and incrementing by

N =500

((526/0.1)1/N )%.

Our baseline estimation uses

bins, but we re-estimated our results using 50, 100, and 1,000 bins as well. We then

calculate the distance between all supermarkets in the sample (333) and assign each pair of
supermarkets (55,278) to its proper bin according to their distance range.

14 See http://www.precios.uy/servicios/ciudadanos.html.
15 See Borraz and Zipitria (2012) for a detailed description of the database and an analysis on its price
stickiness.

Finally, we dene the following specication:

Qn (|pi,t ‚àí pj,t |, q) = Œ± + Œ≤Dn + Œ≥Bn + Œ¥1 Bn √ó Dn + Œ¥2 F irmn + n

where

is a dummy that takes the value 1 if the supermarkets are in dierent cities;

is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the price dierence in bin

n comes from

the same supermarket chain. We also add an interaction dummy between distance and the
city border dummy, and xed eects for each good.

Notice that this regression requires that we have both observations within and across
cities that overlap in distance bins. Figure 6 shows the distribution of observations for each
of the 500 bins for the same city pairs and the dierent city pairs. The horizontal axis is the
log distance starting at 100 meters to a maximum of 526 km. The black line is the number
of observations per bin for the stores within the same city boundaries, while the gray line
are the observations for the stores in dierent cities. There is a non-trivial range in which
stores are separated exactly by the same distance within cities and across cities although
almost all of them between 5 to 15 kilometers. This is the source of the variation where the
city-border eect is actually estimated.

[Figure 6 here]

4 Results
As described in Section 2.2, we pool all the prices into each corresponding bin and estimate
the distribution of price dierences. We select the mean, median, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97.5, 99, 99.5

17

and 99.9th percentiles. For each of these we estimate equation (9) by weighted least squares
to account for dierences in the number of observations inside each bin. Price dierences
are expressed in percentage terms, while distance is measured in hundreds of kilometers.

[Table 2 about here]

The results are presented in Table 2. The rst coecient is the segmentation generated
by distance. The second and third estimate the eect of the city boundaries (border dummy)
and the interaction term (how the eect of distance changes once the stores are in dierent
cities), respectively. The fourth coecient is the impact of both stores belonging to the same
retailer, and the last one is the constant term. Each column reects a dierent regression.
The rst one uses the mean within each bin, which replicates the standard regressions in
the literature. After that we present the results for the quantiles moving from the 50th until
99.9th percentiles and nally the maximum.

Notice that as we increase the percentile, all individual coecients increase in line with
the intuition we discussed before. This pattern can be easily appreciated in Figures 7 and
8, which show the coecient on distance and city dummy, respectively, as a function of the
percentile.

[Figure 7 and Figure 8 here]

There are two alternatives to compute the border eect. One way is to base the eect
upon a specic distance.

First, we calculate the degree of price dispersion when the two

stores are located in dierent cities. Then we solve for the distance that would be needed for
two stores within the same city to have the same degree of price dispersion. The following

18

16

example claries the analysis.

Using the results in the rst column (average) in Table 2,

we compute the price dispersion of two cities across the border that are 10 km apart. The
price dispersion is

5.081 + 4.188 ‚àó 0.1 + 1.260 ‚àí 4.049 ‚àó 0.1 = 6.355.

city exhibit a segmentation equal to
city segmentation equal to

6.355

5.081 + 4.188 ‚àó X .

Solving for

Two stores in the same

X

to make the within

yields 30.5 km. Therefore the border adds 20 kilometers

to two stores 10 kilometers apart that is, the city border triples the distance.

Although

the literature simply uses the ratio of the two coecients to compute the border eect, our
specication also allows for non-linearities. Therefore the implied border eect needs to be
estimated conditional to a given distance.

In Panel (a) of Figure 9 we compute this implied additional distance for two stores 10
km apart for each of the quantiles. The border eect, as measured in kilometers, collapses
towards zero around the 99.5th percentile. Interestingly, the eect is even found negative
at the highest percentiles. In addition, notice the (almost) monotonic decrease in the estimates.

This is encouraging from an errors-in-variables point of view.

If the maximum of

the distribution were the result of large errors-in-variables, there is no reason to expect the
estimates and the impact of the border eect to remain similar to the upper percentiles.

[Figure 9 here]

The second way to compute the border eect is to focus on the relative price dispersion for
a given distance. In other words, we compute how large is the implied degree of segmentation
for a pair of stores 10 km apart across two cities, relative to another pair of stores 10 km
apart within the same city. In both cases we consider all stores that do not belong to the
same retailer. For instance, in the average case (column 1 in Table 2) the price dispersion

16 We show the results for 10 kilometers but results remain qualitatively the same for stores 15 and 20
kilometers apart. Given the characteristics of our data, it makes no sense to go beyond that distance because
in the city of Montevideo there are very few observations with stores more than 20 kilometers apart.

19

for

Dn = 0.1

and

Bn = 1

The price dispersion when

is, as before,

Bn = 0

is

5.081 + 4.188 ‚àó 0.1 + 1.260 ‚àí 4.049 ‚àó 0.1 = 6.355.

5.081 + 4.188 ‚àó 0.1 = 5.499.

Thus the border implies

a 15.57 percent higher degree of segmentation. However, this relative eect becomes small
and insignicant using higher quantiles. In Panel (b) in Figure 9 we present the decreasing
pattern in the relative degree of segmentation, together with its 95th condence band.

Panels (a) and (b) show that the degree of segmentation is overestimated and the impact
of distance is underestimated when the average price deviations are used. By contrast, the
eect of the border becomes not signicantly dierent from zero when the upper quantiles
of the distribution within each bin are used. Notice that the reduction in the border eect
is not a mechanical consequence of the methodology. The estimation using upper quantiles
should in fact increase the absolute value of all coecients simply because there is less
sample selection. The decrease in the nal border eect, however, comes from the fact that
the bias in the distance coecient is larger than in the border coecient.

4.1 Robustness
In this section we test the sensibility of the baseline estimates to changing the specication
of the regression, to dierent subsamples of product mix, elimination of outliers, and to
dierent number of bins. In all cases we nd that the results are qualitatively similar. That
is, the traditional regression (average price dispersion) estimates a large and signicant city
border eect, whereas quantile regressions show that the city border becomes insignicant
using upper quantiles of the distribution. Furthermore, the results are similar at the highest
percentiles and the maximum, suggesting that the estimates are not signicantly aected by
measurement errors.

20

First, we modify the equation to the following non-linear specication:

Qn (|pi,t ‚àí pj,t |, q) = Œ± + Œ≤Dn + Œ≥Bn + Œ¥1 Bn √ó Dn + Œ¥2 Dn2 + Œ¥3 Dn3
+Œ¥4 Bn √ó Dn2 + Œ¥5 Bn √ó Dn3 + Œ¥6 F irmn + n

(10)

where the variables are dened as in equation 9.

The results, presented in Table 3, yield the same patterns we described above for the baseline estimation. In absolute value, all point estimates increase as the estimation is performed
over the higher quantiles. Furthermore, if one computes the implied additional distance, the
results remain qualitatively the same as those in Panel (a) in Figure 9. The border eect, as
measured in kilometers, is close to 25 km using the traditional regression (average). However
it decreases with higher percentiles, until it becomes small and insignicant at the 97.5th
percentile.

In addition, we perform three robustness tests using dierent subsamples. Results are
presented in Appendix A.3, for both the linear and non-linear specications.
eliminate products in which the matching across stores is not perfect.

First, we

In particular, we

exclude meat, bread, among other categories. Quantile regressions yield identical patterns
as when using the complete dataset. Second, we use all products but eliminate the outliers,
dened here as those whose price is above three times (or a third below) the median price.
This approach is more conservative that the one typically used in the literature. For example,
Gopinath and Rigobon (2008) and Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008) eliminate prices that are
more than 10 times higher or less that a tenth of the median price.

Still, our rule only

excludes 11.2 thousand in 32.8 million, or just 0.034% of the observations. Once again, the
patterns are almost identical to the ones obtained using the complete number of observations.
The only minor dierence is that, for a given percentile, the border eects are smaller in

21

absolute terms. In other words, the estimated implied distances are smaller than those in
Panel (a) in Figure 9. Third, we further combine the two cases above and estimate quantile
regressions excluding goods with imperfect matching as well as those dened as outliers. The
results do not yield signicant dierences with respect to our baseline estimation.

Lastly, we tested the linear and non-linear specications to the sensibility of the number
of distance bins. Instead of 500 bins, we re-estimated using 50, 100, and 1,000 bins. Notice
the trade-o in the selection of bins. The advantage of a larger number of bins is that each
pair of stores is allocated to a very specic distance bin and the distance representing the
bin is closer to the real distance across the stores. The disadvantage is that the number of
observations within each bin decreases. In the limit, if the bins are so narrow that each store
pair belongs to a single bin, then the problem is that the estimation at the 99.9 percentile
becomes very noisy.

17

The results are qualitatively the same to the baseline estimation. The

city-border eect measured in kilometers falls and becomes insignicant when the upper
quantiles are used in the estimation.

5 The Online Border Eect
We now use online and oine prices from a retailer in Uruguay to estimate an online border
eect. The degree of segmentation between online and oine markets is an interesting topic
by itself, but has received little attention because of the data limitations.

Selling online

allows a retailer to price discriminate among consumers who have time to travel to a store
and those who prefer the convenience of online shopping.

By deciding to buy online, the

17 Future research should formally address the optimal bandwidth selection. For the moment we compare
the results across dierent specications, and do not explore the issue further because the results remain
essentially identical. It is possible that if the estimation is done using less frequent data such as month by
month, or using a much smaller dataset, then the issue of bandwidth selection becomes more important.
This was not the case in our application.

22

consumer may therefore be paying a cost in terms of price dispersion (in addition to any
delivery charges).

We use data collected by the Billion Prices Project at MIT (BPP) using a method that
scans the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) code of public retailers' website, identifying
and storing all relevant price and product information on a daily basis.

18

The largest grocery

retailer in Uruguay sells products in dozens of oine locations, as well as online, in the city
of Montevideo.

We compared the daily prices of all goods in the DGC oine data with

their corresponding online price on the same date. Both datasets contain daily prices for the
period between October 1st 2007 and December 31th 2010.

Figure 10 provides an example of the prices posted in the dierent stores (including the
online store) for a given product over time. On most dates, the online price is within the
range of prices observed in oine stores.

This feature is observed in most goods in the

sample.

[ Figure 10 here ]

Suppose a consumer decides to buy a good from the retailer's website instead of walking
to an oine location.

What is the eect of crossing this online border on prices?

We

can calculate an online border eect by simply estimating the implied distance that would
produce the same degree of online-oine price dispersion observed in the data. We calculate
this eect in two steps. First, we estimate the following regression for each quantile

q

using

only data from the oine stores:

Qn (|pi,t ‚àí pj,t |, q) = Œª + Œ≤Dn + n
18 See Cavallo (2010) for additional details on the online data scraping methodology.

23

(11)

Notice this is equal to equation 9 with
and

Œª = Œ± + Œ≥.

The coecient

Œ≤

Bn = 0

(same city),

F irmn = 1

(same retailer),

therefore provides an estimate of the eect of distance

on the dispersion of prices across locations. Finally, to calculate the implied online border
eect we simply compute the average online-oine price dispersion (between all pairs of
online-oine stores), subtract the constant

Œª

and divide by

Œ≤.

[Table 4 here]

We estimated regression 11 using both the traditional and the binned-quantile methods,
and computed the online border in both cases. Table 4 shows that using the traditional OLS
regression provides an implied distance of 1.6 kilometers. By contrast, if we use the 95th
percentile we obtain an implied distance of 8.78 kilometers.

How do we know which estimate is better? We can compare the results in both methods
to the actual distance of the online store. Although the warehouse of the online store is
not known, the website of this retailer states that the online prices are identical to those
available in an oine store that lls the orders. It fails to name it explicitly, but we can
compute a simple matching probability between the online prices and each of the oine
stores to identify it. This matching probability is just the average probability that the online
price is identical to the price in an oine store on any given day. We calculate it at the store
level in two steps.

First, for each product, we compute the share of days that the online

price is identical to the oine price. And second, we get the mean (or median) across all
products in that store.

[Table 5 here]

Table 5 shows that online prices most closely resemble those of oine store number
22.

The last column in the table shows the physical distance between store 22 and each

24

of the other oine stores.

The average distance is 7.22 kilometers (and a median of 8.04

km). This number is very close to the estimate we obtained by using the 95th percentile in
the regression. In this case, the traditional regression greatly

underestimates

the degree of

online-oine market segmentation.

This example illustrates why our method will not mechanically cause a reduction in
border eects every time.

By using the largest observed price dierences, we know that

all coecients and constant in 9 will increase, because the standard OLS method creates a
downward bias in all of them. But whether the border

eect

rises or falls depends on the

magnitude of those changes. In the case of the online border in equation 11, the distance
coecient

Œ≤

rises less than the constant, as shown in Table 4. This is because we are only

looking at stores within the city of Montevideo, where the share of identical prices is very
large. When the traditional OLS regression is used, the average price dispersion captured by

Œª is extremely small.

When those identical prices are ignored, as we do with our methodology,

Œª rises signicantly more than the Œ≤

coecient on distance, and the border eect" increases.

6 Conclusions
The extensive literature on the degree of segmentation resulting from political borders has
reported extremely large transaction costs introduced by country, province, and even city
borders. In this paper we argue that some of those estimates have been overstated because
the empirical strategy has not taken into account the selection problem in posted prices:
when a rm faces the possibility of arbitrage due to the existence of a transaction cost,
the rm sets prices subject to a no-arbitrage constraint. However, if the optimal price falls
within the no-arbitrage range, the dispersion in prices is not informative of the tightness of
the constraint. A rm may set the same price in two locations, but it does not mean that

25

the arbitrage cost for the consumer is zero. This implies that the estimation using average
absolute price dierences or standard deviations of price dierences will not capture the size
of the trade or arbitrage cost.

This paper builds on the existing literature with two main contributions. In the rst place,
it oers an alternative methodology to estimate transactions costs which not only can be
applied in international trade, but also in other areas as in empirical nance, measurement
of liquidity, or the cost of regulatory restrictions.

In the second place, we show that city

borders matter little for price dispersion within a country. Although the border eect of a
city should be small from an intuitive point of view, the traditional methods still estimated
a very wide border eect (20 additional kilometers to two stores separated 10 km apart,
that is, the border triples the distance). This is particularly large in a country where the
largest city is less than 40 kilometers wide and there are no signicant dierences between
cities in terms of taxes, language and the like. By contrast, the border becomes insignicant
once we estimate using our method of distance-binned quantile regressions. We illustrate our
method to measure border eects for the online-oine border in Montevideo, and showed
that we can correctly approximate the true average distance between the oine stores and
the location where online purchases are sourced by simply using price gap data.

Finally, we believe further research should advance in at least two dimensions. From a
methodological point of view, it is important to further examine the denition of optimal
bandwidths. Although in our paper we used dierent bin sizes and results remained consistent across all specications, this may not be the case in other applications in economics.
And second, similar micro-level data needs to be collected across several countries to shed
light on the actual width of international borders.

Note: We calculate the price gaps (in absolute value) for all goods sold in a single retailer across two locations.
We picked a random store from the largest retailer in the country and compared its prices to those of other
stores from the same retailer located at 1 km, 10 km (same city), 10 km (dierent city), and 20 km (dierent
city).

Where DC denotes pairs in dierent cities.

The graph excludes the mass at 0% to facilitate the

comparison of positive gaps. The table shows the distributional statistics for all price gaps, including those
at 0% (identical prices).

Figure 3: Bias in Standard Regressions

Note: This gure illustrates the source of the selection bias. The horizontal axis shows the bins for a range
of distances. The vertical axis is the absolute price dierence across locations. For each bin, all the absolute
dierences from the data are shown as the black dots.

The thick black line reects the price dierence

implied by the no-arbitrage constraint. Because all the observed price dierences are less or equal to the
thick line, the estimation in the standard regression which implicitly uses the mean within each bin (red
line) is downward biased.

32

Figure 4: Bias in Standard Regression in the presence of EIV

Note: The black thick line is still the true upper bound of the no-arbitrage band, i.e. the true degree of
segmentation. However due to EIV, some price dierences might even be above the no-arbitrage range. In
this case, using the maximum within each bin also produces a bias in the estimation. For this reason we use
a series of quantile regressions instead.

We

the oine stores and the online stores.

If the usual procedure is used,

online and oine markets appear to be very closely integrated, with an
equivalent border of 1.6 kilometers. When the 95th percentile of the price
gap distribution is used, the online border eect becomes 8.8 kilometers.
This is very close to the actual physical average distance between the online
warehouse (store 22, where the online goods appear to be delivered from)
and each of the oine stores in the city.

A Appendix
A.1 Proofs to the model of price-setting with arbitrage
A.1.1

Consumers

Lemma 1.

Proof.

The price space is non empty.

Given prices

pi

and

consumer located on store
as

` = `i .

pj

the right hand side of the inequality is non negative for the

`i .

In this case, equation 6 is

| pi ‚àí pj |‚â§

Œ≤ÃÉ
Œ∏

|` ‚àí `j | + Œ≥ÃÉŒ∏ bj + Œ∏Œ¥ÃÉ Ij ,

This implies that there must exist at least one price in order for the consumer to

compare its bundles. Thus both the right and left hand side of the inequality are positive.
Lemma 2.

Proof.

The inequality constraint is binding only for the marginal consumer.

The marginal consumer can be dened as the one obtaining the same utility from

buying in both stores, that is

u` (i) = u` (j).

Œ≥ÃÉbi ‚àí Œ¥ÃÉIi = v ‚àí Œ∏pj ‚àí Œ≤ÃÉ | ` ‚àí `j | ‚àíŒ≥ÃÉbj ‚àí Œ¥ÃÉIj .
Œ≤ÃÉ
Œ∏

|`j ‚àí `i | +

A.1.2

Œ≥ÃÉ
Œ∏

M bi,j +

Œ¥ÃÉ
Œ∏

This in turn implies that

v ‚àí Œ∏pi ‚àí Œ≤ÃÉ |` ‚àí `i | ‚àí

Rearranging terms we obtain that

| pi ‚àí pj |=

M Ii,j .

Producers

Lemma 3.

Firms maximize prots by setting the price that binds the participation constraint

for consumer i.
Proof.

Given the prices of all stores except for

equation in terms of

pj ,

j,

and given the right hand side of the

Kuhn Tucker conditions determine that the price dierence should

be maximal. That is, when the consumer restriction is binding. At the same time, notice
that the marginal consumer for rm

j

determines the demand for its products.

43

Proposition 4.

Proof.

The consumer that maximizes prots is the marginal consumer.

From Lemma 2 and Lemma 3, the rm sets the maximum price for the marginal

consumer.

Proposition 5.

For any given two stores (locations), the parameters can only be estimated

for the marginal consumer, i.e. where the inequality is binding.
Proof.

From Lemma 2 and Proposition 4, the rm sets its price for the marginal consumer

such that equation 6 is binding. Therefore the price dierences will be maximum given the
store location and other exogenous variables for the consumer.

Lemma 6.

If transportation costs increase (beta) or a border exists between two stores, or if

the sensitivity of the consumer to price changes decrease, then the price dispersion increase.
Proof.

A.1.3

Take partial derivatives of each coecient on the last equation of Lemma 2.

Consumer heterogeneity: Discussion

So far we have assumed that consumers only dier in their location on the line. However
consumers can also dier in their valuation of the good. This feature can be introduced to the
original model in either two ways. First, consumers can dier in their maximum valuation
of the good, in which case

v ‚àà [v, v].

In this case, previous results are easily maintained

as well, although now satisfying two conditions for the marginal consumer: indierence in
distance and in valuation. Recall that previous results are for the medium consumer. Second,
consumers can dier in their disposition to pay for the good, i.e.



Œ∏ ‚àà Œ∏, Œ∏ .

Similarly

as before, there are two constraints to estimate the demand for each store: the distance
constraint and the valuation constraint.

44

Therefore adding heterogeneity to consumers' taste does not change the estimation procedure. In order to estimate the demand for each store, we must still solve the model for
the marginal consumer. As previously shown, the price inequality should only be binding
for this consumer, and slack for non-marginal consumers.

A.2 Samuelson's Iceberg Costs
The results from our model of product arbitrage is also related to the no-arbitrage pricing
region generated in Samuelson's Iceberg costs.

19

Assume that there is an arbitrage cost

between two locations that can be described as follows:

œÑi,j,t = Œ± + Œ≤Di,j + Œ≥Bi,j + Œ¥Xi,j,t

where the variables are dened as before. This arbitrage cost

œÑ

the item that is lost when a customer transports one unit from
arbitrage costs, prices need to lie within the range

(12)

represents the proportion of

i

to

|pi ‚àí pj | ‚â§ œÑi,j,t

j .20

Under this form of

to avoid the possibility

that a customer arbitrates across locations. In particular, assume that

pi

is set. The second

store, when deciding its price, maximizes prots subject to the no-arbitrage constraint. If
the optimal price is such that the dierence between

pi

and

pj

is smaller than

constraint is not binding and the price dierence is a biased estimate of

œÑ.

œÑ

then the

But if the

dierence is larger, then the store sets the price at the corner solution and the constraint
is binding. This simple behavior implies that the absolute dierence of log prices satises
inequality 1, which can be rewritten as

|pi ‚àí pj | ‚â§ œÑi,j,t = Œ± + Œ≤Di,j + Œ≥B + Œ¥Xi,j,t .

19 See Samuelson (1954).
20 For simplicity in the exposition it is assumed that the arbitrageur is the customer itself.

Thus the

arbitrage cost can be interpreted not only as the loss of physical items, but also the loss in terms of utility
that the customer would experience if were forced to travel from one location to another.
