Is Conflicted Investment Advice Better than No Advice?
John Chalmers and Jonathan Reuter
NBER Working Paper No. 18158
June 2012, Revised September 2015
JEL No. D14,G11,G23
ABSTRACT
The answer depends on how broker clients would have invested in the absence of broker recommendations.
To identify counterfactual retirement portfolios, we exploit time-series variation in access to brokers
by new plan participants. When brokers are available, they are chosen by new participants who value
recommendations on asset allocation and fund selection because they are less financially experienced.
When brokers are no longer available, demand for target-date funds (TDFs) increases differentially
among participants with the highest predicted demand for brokers. Broker client portfolios earn significantly
lower risk-adjusted returns and Sharpe ratios than matched portfolios based on TDFs—due in part
to broker fees that average 0.90% per year—but offer similar levels of risk. More generally, the portfolios
of participants with high predicted demand for brokers who lack access to brokers comparable favorably
to the portfolios of similar participants who had access to brokers when they joined. Exploiting across-fund
variation in the level of broker fees, we find that broker clients allocate more dollars to higher fee funds.
This finding increases our confidence that actual broker client portfolios reflect broker recommendations,
and it highlights an agency conflict that can be eliminated when TDFs replace brokers.

I. Introduction
Providing financial advice to investors is a multi-billion dollar industry. Because investment returns are volatile, however, it can be difficult for investors—even those who are financially sophisticated—to distinguish good recommendations from bad. This fact raises important
questions about the quality of the recommendations that investors receive from their brokers.1,2
Anagol, Cole, and Sarkar (2013), Christoffersen, Evans, and Musto (2013), Hackethal, Inderst,
and Meyer (2012), Hoechle, Ruenzi, Schaub, and Schmid (2015), and Mullainathan, Nöth, and
Schoar (2012) use a variety of empirical strategies to show that broker recommendations reflect
brokers’ self-interests.3 Nevertheless, demand for broker recommendations is likely to be highest among those investors with the lowest levels of financial sophistication. This begs the question of whether broker clients are better off holding portfolios based on conflicted recommendations or holding counterfactual portfolios constructed on their own.
The lack of data on counterfactual portfolios has limited the ability of other researchers to
measure the net benefit of brokers to their clients.4 Clients benefit from receiving and following
broker recommendations when the expected utility of doing so (net of fees) exceeds the expected
utility of investing on their own. Everything else equal, this difference in expected utilities depends on the quality of the broker recommendations that they follow. However, broker clients
may rationally prefer biased recommendations to no recommendations. The lower the expected
utility associated with a client’s counterfactual portfolio, the more likely that the client is to benefit even from biased recommendations. For example, in Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2015),
brokers increase their clients’ expected utility by increasing equity allocations above counterfactual levels; the high broker fees follow directly from the fact that they are set to split the large
gains to trade. On the other hand, the higher the expected utility associated with a client’s coun

Note that because the financial advice in our setting comes from brokers, we refer to financial advisors as brokers
and we refer to their advice as broker recommendations.

Georgarakos and Inderst (2010) model the impact of financial literacy, trust in financial advice, and legal rights on
stock market participation. In their model, demand for financial advice falls with the level of financial literacy.
Inderst and Ottaviani (2012) and Calcagno and Monticone (2014) model interactions between financial advice, financial literacy, and potential policy interventions.
3
Bergstresser, Chalmers, and Tufano (2009) and Del Guercio and Reuter (2014) use fund-level data to show that
broker-sold mutual funds underperform direct-sold funds
4
For example, it is difficult to measure the net benefit of finance advice in Von Gaudecker (2015) without measures
of counterfactual portfolio diversification. Similarly, while Foerster, Linnainmaa, Melzer and Previtero (2014) are
able to show that broker fixed effects explain client portfolio characteristics and that client portfolios underperform
standard benchmarks, they lack the data on counterfactual portfolios required to measure the net benefit of advice
within their sample of investors. More generally, Hung and Yoong (2013) discuss the limitations of “advice” studies in many contexts due to selection and reverse causality. Their approach is to combine survey data with controlled lab experiments.

terfactual portfolio, the lower the potential benefit from receiving and following biased (or unbiased) recommendations.
The innovation in this paper is that we are able to estimate the causal effect of broker
recommendations relative to this elusive counterfactual. An ideal experiment would identify
counterfactual portfolios by withholding recommendations from a random set of real-world investors who seek to invest through a broker. To measure the causal effect of broker recommendations on portfolio returns, risk levels, and expenses, we would then use the actual portfolios of
these reluctantly self-directed investors to identify the counterfactual portfolios of the broker clients. Our empirical strategy is similar in that we use time-series variation in investor access to
brokers to identify the counterfactual portfolios of broker clients.
Our empirical setting is Oregon University System’s (OUS) Optional Retirement Plan
(ORP), a defined contribution retirement plan introduced in October 1996, as an alternative to
the defined benefit retirement plan covering other state employees.5 When joining ORP, participants choose the (single) investment provider to which their retirement contributions will be sent.
Between October 1996 and October 2007, four providers were available to participants: HIGH,
whose network of brokers provide face-to-face recommendations, and three participant-directed
options: LOW, SMALL, and SMALLER. Effective November 2007, new participants were limited to investing through either LOW or NEW, neither of which provide the same type of personalized attention that HIGH continues to provide existing participants. Our empirical strategy
relies on both the availability of brokers and non-brokers through October 2007 and the loss of
brokers in November 2007. With OUS’s help, we were able to match administrative data on
ORP participants with retirement account-level data from HIGH, LOW, and NEW.6 Our account-level data end in December 2009. Because the employer makes all retirement contributions in ORP, broker recommendations are limited to asset allocation and fund selection. This
fact allows us to abstract from potentially valuable advice that brokers may provide with respect
to taxes, insurance, or savings rates.
The availability of HIGH until October 2007 allows us to study the demand for brokers
within a defined contribution retirement plan. When we focus on demographic characteristics,

See Chalmers, Johnson, and Reuter (2014) for a description of Oregon’s Public Employees Retirement System.
As we show in Table 1, between October 1996 and October 2006, 82.5% of ORP participants choose to invest
through either HIGH or LOW. We lack account-level data for participants who chose to invest through SMALL and
SMALLER because these providers were dropped from ORP on November 2007, which predates our data collection
efforts.

we find that demand for HIGH is negatively correlated with age, salary, and educational attainment. Demand for HIGH is also significantly lower among participants working in an economics department or business school. These patterns reinforce our prior that ORP participants are
more likely to seek broker recommendations when they have lower levels of financial literacy or
less investment experience. To provide more direct evidence on the demand for broker recommendations, we administered an online survey to current ORP participants, asking them to
weight the factors that led them to choose their initial ORP provider. We find strong evidence
that demand for HIGH is driven by demand for face-to-face help with asset allocation decisions.
While these findings increase our confidence that client portfolios reflect the recommendations
of their brokers, they simultaneously highlight the need to identify the portfolios that clients
would have held in the absence of broker recommendations.
The fact that participants joining ORP after October 2007 did not have the option to invest through HIGH allows us to study the extent to which different default investment options
are substitutes for brokers. Using account-level data from HIGH, LOW, and NEW, we identify
participants who, after six months, continue to allocate 100% of their retirement contribution to
their default investment option. Between January 2006 and October 2007, demand for the default option ranges from 1% for HIGH, where the default is a fixed annuity, to 22% for LOW,
where it is a money market fund. Between November 2007 and December 2009, when new participants lack access to brokers, overall demand for default investment options increase significantly. It remains 22% for LOW, where the default remains a money market fund, but jumps to
65% for NEW, where the default is a target-date fund (TDF). These observations are broadly
consistent with participants viewing TDFs, which relieve investors of the need to make asset allocation for fund selection decisions, as effective substitutes for brokers. To provide more direct
evidence on substitution, we show that the model used to predict demand for HIGH in the earlier
period successfully predicts demand for TDFs in the later period.7 Among those participants
with predicted demand for brokers in the top quartile, we find that 47.5% chose to invest in a
TDF (versus 28.7% for participants with predicted demand in the bottom quartile).
Among the sample of participants for whom TDFs substitute for brokers, we are able to
estimate the causal impact of broker recommendations by comparing the actual portfolios of

Our approach both here and below is related to that in Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009), who combine financial
wealth, family size, and educational attainment into a financial sophistication index, and show that higher values of
this index are associated with fewer financial mistakes. The mistakes they consider are under diversification, failure
to rebalance, and the disposition effect.

broker clients to counterfactual portfolios based on TDFs. We find that broker clients earned
significantly lower after-fee returns, lower risk-adjusted returns, and lower Sharpe ratios than
they would have earned if they had been defaulted into age-specific Fidelity TDFs.8 A significant portion of the underperformance is due to broker fees, which average 90 basis points per
year. Point estimates suggest that broker client portfolios are slightly riskier than the counterfactual TDF portfolios, but the differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels.9
Our next comparison of portfolio risk and returns is motivated by Gennaioli et al. (2015).
Their key prediction, based on the assumption that brokers reduce the disutility associated with
bearing financial risk, is that actual portfolios of broker clients will hold more equity than counterfactual portfolios constructed without access to brokers. To test this prediction, we interact
the predicted probability that a participant chooses to invest through HIGH with dummy variables indicating whether the participant does or does not invest through HIGH.10 The estimated
differences in risk taking are striking. Participants who are predicted to invest through a broker
and do so hold portfolios with higher total risk (the volatility of monthly return is 1 percentage
point higher) and higher systematic risk (the CAPM beta is 0.27 higher) than participants who
are predicted to invest through a broker but do not.
Our final approach to measuring the causal effect of brokers is to compare the portfolios
of participant joining before and after HIGH is removed from the set of available providers. This
allows us to compare the full sample of participants with high predicted demand for broker recommendations, and not just the 47.5% who choose to invest in TDFs. We find little evidence
that participants are harmed by the lack of access to these recommendations. In particular, we
find that the Sharpe ratios of the high-broker-demand portfolios are both higher and less variable
than the Sharpe ratios of participants who had access to brokers.
We conclude our analysis by studying fund selection. In the cross section, we find that
funds paying higher broker fees receive significantly higher contributions from broker clients.

Balduzzi and Reuter (2015) document that Fidelity had the largest share of the market for TDFs at the beginning of
our sample period. Note that the Fidelity Freedom funds that we take as our benchmark have relatively high fees
because they invest in a variety of Fidelity’s actively managed funds.
9
When we apply the same empirical strategy to self-directed investors, we find that actual portfolio risk is significantly lower than it would have been if self-directed investors had invested in TDFs. These differences partially
reflect the finding above that approximately 10% of LOW portfolios remain invested in the default money market
fund. Point estimates suggest that self-directed investors underperformed TDFs by economically significant margins, but the differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels.
10
To the extent that participants who are more comfortable bearing market risk are less likely to invest through a
broker, our test will underestimate the impact of brokers on risk taking.

4

This complements the finding in Christoffersen et al. (2013) that broker fees influence fund-level
flows. It also increases our confidence that HIGH investors rely on broker recommendations
when deciding how to allocate their retirement contributions across funds. When we shift our
focus from fees to lagged returns, we find evidence of return chasing by both broker clients and
self-directed investors, at least with respect to the initial set of fund choices.
Our paper contributes to the literature on financial advice in two ways. First, we show
that demand for broker recommendations within a defined contribution retirement plan is driven
by demand for advice on asset allocation and fund selection, especially by less financially experienced investors.11 Second, we provide direct evidence that TDFs are effective substitutes for
brokers. Our evidence strengthens Mitchell and Utkus’ (2012) interpretation that demand for
TDFs in 401(k) plans reflects an implicit demand for financial advice. More importantly, it allows us to benchmark the portfolios of broker clients against well-identified counterfactual portfolios based on TDFs. Doing so reveals that broker clients’ portfolios offer similar exposure to
market risk, but earn significantly lower after-fee returns and Sharpe ratios. When we compare
investors who do and do not use brokers during the first part of our sample period, we find differences in risk taking that are broadly consistent with the prediction of Gennaioli et al. (2015).
This suggests that broker recommendations may be needed to increase risk taking by investors
operating outside of defined contribution retirement plans with well-designed defaults. However, within defined contribution retirement plans, we find that plan participants can achieve similar exposure to market risk at lower cost through the use of TDFs.

II. Empirical Framework and Literature Review
We use a simple framework to highlight the challenges that arise when attempting to
measure the causal effect of broker recommendations on their clients’ portfolios. It also highlights how our paper contributes to the literature on financial advice. We begin with a stylized
model of investors who differ along two dimensions. The first dimension is whether they seek
broker recommendations on asset allocation and fund selection. The second dimension is whether they receive and follow these recommendations. There are four possible cases, illustrated in
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
11

This is not surprising, since as the scope for broker recommendations within ORP is limited to asset allocation and
fund selection, but it raises the possibility that TDFs are effective substitutes for broker recommendations. Had we
been studying demand for recommendations related to taxable investment strategies or estate planning, for example,
we likely would have found positive correlations with income, age, and educational attainment, and we would have
needed a different strategy to identify investors’ counterfactual choices.

Figure 1. We classify investors who seek, receive, and follow recommendations as (Yes, Yes).
These investors are broker clients and their portfolios reflect the recommendations of their brokers. We classify investors who seek but neither receives nor follows recommendations as (Yes,
No). The portfolios of these reluctantly self-directed investors shed light on how broker clients
would have invested in the absence of broker recommendations; the challenge is to identify these
investors in real-world data. We classify intentionally self-directed investors as (No, No). If intentionally self-directed investors have greater financial knowledge or investment experience
than investors seeking broker recommendations, the portfolios of these self-directed investors
will be poor proxies for the counterfactual portfolios of broker clients.12
Potential broker client i benefits from receiving and following recommendations when:
E[Ui (Yes, Yes)] - E[Ui (Yes, No)] > 0.
This difference in expected utilities depends on the quality of the recommendations that client i
follows. Everything else equal, we expect that clients will benefit more from unbiased recommendations than from biased recommendations:
E[Ui (Yes, Yes(Unbiased))] - E[Ui (Yes, Yes(Biased))] > 0.
However, broker clients may rationally prefer biased recommendations to no recommendations:
E[Ui (Yes, Yes(Biased))] - E[Ui (Yes, No)] > 0.
This is because the difference in expected utilities also depends on how client i would have invested in the absence of broker recommendations.

and that this impact increases with educational attainment.

client i’s counterfactual portfolio (e.g., a money market fund), the more likely he is to benefit
even from biased recommendations. For example, investors with lower levels of financial literacy may be both more likely to seek broker recommendations and more susceptible when investing on their own to the forms of strategic complexity described in Gabaix and Laibson (2006)
and Carlin (2009). In addition, the lower the expected utility associated with client i’s counterfactual portfolio, the more biased or expensive may be the recommendation that the client receives. For example, the fees charged by brokers in Gennaioli et al.’s (2015) model are higher
when the expected benefits of broker services to their clients are larger precisely because there
are larger gains from trade.
Rather than attempt to test for differences in expected utility, empirical studies of financial advisors test for differences in portfolio characteristics correlated with expected utility. The
causal effect of broker recommendations on client portfolio characteristic Z is given by:
E[Z|(Yes, Yes)] - E[Z|(Yes, No)].
We can estimate the first term using data on the returns, risk exposures, and fees of the actual
portfolios of broker clients, but the second term depends on the characteristics of the portfolios
that broker clients would have held in the absence of broker recommendations.
The existing literature focuses on the quality of broker recommendations.13 One branch
analyzes fund-level data. Bergstresser, Chalmers, and Tufano (2009) show that broker-sold mutual funds underperform direct-sold mutual funds even after adding back the 12b-1 fees used to
pay brokers. Del Guercio and Reuter (2014) rationalize this underperformance by showing that
flows into broker-sold funds chase raw rather than risk-adjusted returns. They show that the underperformance of actively managed funds is limited to the broker-sold segment, where demand
for index funds is extremely low. Christoffersen et al. (2013) show that flows into broker-sold
funds are higher when funds pay higher fees to brokers. These papers reveal that broker-sold
funds are lower quality than direct-sold funds, and they imply that broker recommendations are
conflicted, but they do not shed light on how broker clients would have invested in the absence
of brokers.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
13

An interesting exception is Bhattacharya et al. (2012), who use an experimental design to estimate the causal effect of offering unbiased recommendations to investors who are not actively seeking them. In our framework, this
corresponds to estimating: E[Z|(No, Yes(Unbiased))] - E[Y|(No, No)]. They find that self-directed investors who
choose to receive and follow the recommendations are able to improve their portfolios, but that demand for unsolicited recommendations is low. This is consistent both with the psychology literature on unsolicited advice described
in Hung and Yoong (2013) and with their experimental evidence.

7

The other branch of the literature analyzes account-level data, often obtained from banks
located outside the United States. Hackethal, Haliassos, and Jappelli (2012) and Karabulut
(2013) use German data to show that broker clients underperform self-directed investors. These
comparisons only measure the causal effect of brokers under the strong assumption that broker
clients’ portfolios would have resembled self-directed investor portfolios in the absence of recommendations. Hackethal, Inderst, and Meyer (2012) also use portfolio-level data from a German bank to study trades by broker clients. They find that the bank earns higher revenues from
the subset of clients who self-report placing the most trust in their brokers. Hoechle, Ruenzi,
Schaub, and Schmid (2015) compare broker-initiated trades with self-initiated trades at a Swiss
bank and find that broker-initiated trades generate higher bank profits. Foerster, Linnainmaa,
Melzer and Previtero (2014) find strong evidence that clients of financial advisors in Canada follow their recommendations but little evidence that advisors offer different advice to different clients. Finally, Mullainathan, Nöth, and Schoar (2012) use an audit study methodology to measure
how recommended portfolios differ from the initial portfolios that the auditors show to brokers.
They find strong evidence that broker recommendations are biased in directions that are likely to
benefit brokers and little evidence that broker recommendations improve upon the initial portfolios.
These papers raise important questions about whether and how broker recommendations
can be improved, but they are silent on how broker clients would have invested in the absence of
these recommendations. In contrast, the evolution of the ORP investment menu allows us to exploit unique time-series variation in the access to brokers and show that TDFs are reasonable
counterfactual portfolios for those investors most likely to seek investment advice inside a defined contribution retirement plan.

III. Who Seeks Broker Recommendations?
A. Institutional Details
In October 1996, Oregon University System (OUS) introduced a defined contribution
plan, known as the Optional Retirement Plan (ORP). The goal was to provide a portable alternative to the defined benefit plan being offered to public employees, known as the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). OUS covers seven campuses and the Office of the Chancellor.
When ORP was introduced, existing OUS employees had to make a “one-time, irrevocable”
choice between ORP and PERS.14 New OUS faculty, administrators, and other employees had
to choose between ORP and PERS six months after they are hired, with the default option being
PERS.
We study the sample of OUS employees who actively choose ORP over PERS.15 We
begin by exploiting the fact that, unlike a typical defined contribution plan, ORP participants are
allowed to choose from among multiple investment providers. Between October 1996 and October 2007, ORP participants have the choice between two insurance companies (which we refer to
as HIGH and LOW) and two mutual fund families (SMALL and SMALLER). From our perspective, the most important distinction between the four providers is that HIGH uses—and markets itself as using—a network of brokers to provide relatively high levels of “personal face-toface service.” In contrast, LOW, SMALL and SMALLER are more representative of investordirected providers available through other defined contribution retirement plans in that they
charge lower fees but provide less personalized service.16 Because the ORP retirement contribution amount is both set by OUS and paid by OUS on behalf of the employee, the scope for brokers to increase savings rates is limited.17 As a result, broker recommendations in our setting are
limited to recommendations on asset allocation and fund selection. This fact is likely to explain
why we find that demand for financial advice is negatively correlated with proxies for financial
literacy (like salary and educational attainment) while surveys and papers studying demand for
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
14

Employees who converted from PERS to the ORP in 1996 may have legacy PERS benefits in addition to any
ORP benefits that have accrued since 1996. However, due to data limitations discussed below, much of our analysis
focuses on OUS employees hired after January 1999.
15
Chalmers, Johnson, and Reuter (2014) study the retirement timing decisions of Oregon public employees who are
covered by PERS and were never eligible for ORP. Chalmers and Reuter (2012) studies the demand by PERS retirees for life annuities versus lump sums.
16
LOW eventually begin offering investors the opportunity to meet one-on-one with representative, who would provide participants with investment guidance, but not until 2006.
17
Using OUS data we examined the use of supplementary 403(b) retirement plans by ORP participants. We found
that approximately two percent of ORP participants who invest through HIGH open a 403(b) plan versus approximately one percent of all other ORP participants.

financial advice in other settings tend to find that it is positively correlated.
To identify how broker clients would have invested in the absence of broker recommendations, we exploit time-series variation in the set of investment providers available to new ORP
participants. Effective November 2007, ORP drops HIGH, SMALL, and SMALLER, and adds
NEW, a well-known mutual fund family.18 The crucial change is that ORP participants who join
after October 2007 cannot choose to invest their retirement contributions through a broker.
We use administrative data from OUS to identify the provider through which each ORP
participant chooses to invest. We report these counts in Table 1.19 Between October 1996 and
October 2007, LOW is the most popular provider. It is chosen by 50.7% of the 5,807 participants who join ORP during “Regime 1.” HIGH, which offers face-to-face interactions with brokers, is also quite popular, and is chosen by 31.7% of participants. During “Regime 2,” the period beginning in November 2007 and ending in December 2009, when our administrative data
end, new participants are limited to LOW or NEW. Of the 734 participants who join during Regime 2, 54.8% choose LOW and 45.2% choose NEW.
The last two columns of Table 1 report the number of ORP-eligible employees who
choose the defined contribution retirement plan, ORP, over the defined benefit retirement plan,
PERS. During Regime 1, 24.3% of ORP-eligible employees choose ORP. During Regime 2, the
fraction falls to 21.0%. This decline is smaller than we expected given our prior that the lack of
access to brokers, combined with the extreme market volatility during Regime 2, would increase
the relative attractiveness of a retirement plan that manages assets on the employee’s behalf
(Brown and Weisbenner (2007)).

B. Participant Characteristics and the Choice of Investment Provider
Investors may seek broker recommendations because they lack the financial knowledge
and confidence required to allocate retirement contributions across asset classes and funds, because they derive utility from the one-on-one relationship, or both. An expanding literature links
differences in gender, age, income, ethnicity, and education to differences in financial literacy.
However, because ORP is only available to employees of the Oregon University System, our
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
18

Participants already investing through HIGH and LOW are allowed to continue doing so, while participants already investing through SMALL or SMALLER have their investments mapped into comparable funds managed by
NEW.
19
Because OUS switched payroll systems in 1998, the contribution and salary data begin in January 1999. For those
joining ORP between October 1996 and January 1999, the ORP enrollment date is left censored at January 1999.

sample of defined contribution plan participants is not representative of the general population.
For example, Hispanic women with PhDs may behave differently than the Hispanic women
without PhDs who have been studied in other settings. When interpreting our results, it is important to keep this caveat in mind. The other important caveat is that we are studying the subset
of employees who choose a defined contribution plan over a defined benefit plan.
Table 2 reports separate summary statistics for OUS employees who join ORP during
Regime 1 and Regime 2. The sample sizes are lower than in Table 1 because we require data on
each participant’s initial monthly salary, gender, age, job classification, and self-reported ethnicity. The main comparison of interest in Table 2 is between participants who choose to invest
through HIGH during Regime 1 (column (2)) and those who choose to invest through LOW,
SMALL, or SMALLER (column (3)). This comparison allows us to determine which demographic characteristics are correlated with demand for broker recommendations within our sample of investors. Because we only possess account-level data for HIGH and LOW, column (4)
reports statistics for participants who choose LOW, allowing a direct comparison between HIGH
and LOW. We use job classification codes to identify research faculty (i.e., job classification
includes the string “Teach/Res”), participants who are employed by a business school or economics department, and participants who are employed by another “quantitative department”
(i.e., organizational description includes a reference to business, computer sciences, engineering,
life sciences, mathematics, physical sciences, or social sciences). We only possess data on educational attainment at the time of employment for 57.6% of ORP participants, because these data
were only collected by a subset of campuses and (surprisingly) only through December 2004.
Univariate comparisons between HIGH and the other providers (or LOW) reveal interesting differences. First, HIGH participants earn 14.1% lower monthly salaries than other participants who join ORP during Regime 1. Second, demand for HIGH is substantially higher in the
under-30 age group (21.2% versus 15.6%), which likely includes participants with both the longest investment horizons and the least investment experience. Third, demand for HIGH decreases
with educational attainment. Of those choosing HIGH, 39.7% have a Ph.D. versus 52.8% of
those choosing to invest through other providers. These three differences suggest that—even
within our relatively homogenous sample of faculty and administrators—demand for brokers
falls with income, age, and education.20 Consistent with studies that find lower levels of finan

Income and education are well accepted proxies for financial literacy. For example, Campbell (2006) shows that
homeowners with higher income and more education are more likely to refinance their mortgage when interest rates

11

cial literacy among females and minorities (e.g., Lusardi and Mitchell (2007b) and Lusardi and
Tufano (2009)), we also find higher demand for brokers among female participants. However,
we find little evidence that demand for brokers varies with ethnicity.
Table 2 also allows us to compare the characteristics of employees who choose ORP during each sample period. In an ideal experiment, the 4,680 participants in Regime 1 would closely resemble the 614 participants in Regime 2. A comparison of columns (1) and (5), however,
reveals several differences. Participants joining during Regime 2 have higher (nominal) salaries,
are much more likely to be female, are younger, and are much less likely to be faculty members.
To control for changes in participant composition across sample periods, we include all of these
characteristics in the model that we use to predict demand for brokers. Because we lack data on
educational attainment for the participants in Regime 2, however, we cannot directly control for
any differences in education.

C. Predicting Demand for Broker Recommendations
We estimate a series of probits to identify those investor characteristics that predict demand for broker recommendations. The dependent variable in Table 3 is one if participant i’s
initial ORP retirement contribution is directed to HIGH and zero otherwise. Column (1) of Table
3 reports coefficients estimated on the full sample of ORP participants described in Column (1)
of Table 2. This sample includes participants for whom we do not observe the date of the choice
(because all choices made before February 1999 are coded as January 1999), and it includes participants for whom we do not observe educational attainment. In Columns (2) and (3) of Table
3, we restrict the sample to participants for whom we observe the actual date of the initial ORP
contribution. This restriction allows us to compare specifications that do and do not include a
separate fixed effect for the year and month of the choice. The fixed effects allow us to control
for time-varying economic conditions. In Columns (4) and (5), we further restrict our sample to
those campuses and years for which data on educational attainment are available. We report
marginal effects, along with standard errors clustered on the year and month of the choice.21
The marginal effects in Table 3 are largely consistent with the univariate comparisons.
Given the fact that one-third of ORP participants choose to invest through HIGH, they are also
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
fall. Lusardi and Tufano (2009) provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on financial literacy and retirement behavior.
21
Since choices made before February 1999 are coded as January 1999, and these choices are included in the sample
used to estimate coefficients in Column (1), in this sample, we allow for clustering in all of the early choices.

12

economically significant. Increasing an employee’s monthly salary by one standard deviation
reduces demand for a broker by approximately seven percentage points. Similarly, employees
who are less than 30 years old when hired (the omitted category) are approximately seven percentage points more likely to invest through a broker. Participants with PhDs are approximately
11 percentage points less likely to invest through a broker, and those employed by a business
school or economics department are between 9 and 17 percentage points less likely to invest
through a broker. The one notable difference between Table 2 and Table 3 is that when we restrict the sample to those participants for which we observe data on educational attainment, we
find female participants are approximately 5 percentage points less likely to invest through a
broker. With respect to ethnicity, many of the estimated coefficients are positive and economically significant (relative to the omitted category “White”), but only the dummy variable indicating whether participant i reports being Asian is statistically significant. When we include fixed
effects to control for market conditions in the year and month of the choice, we find that the estimated coefficients on participant characteristics are quantitatively similar to those obtained in
specifications that exclude these fixed effects.
When we turn our attention to the campus fixed effects, we find that demand for HIGH is
significantly lower at Oregon State University, the Office of the Chancellor, and one of the three
regional campuses than at University of Oregon (the omitted category). The lower demand for
brokers at Oregon State University, which houses the engineering school, is consistent with the
evidence that numeracy is an important determinant of financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell
(2007a)). Another explanation—more likely to apply to the regional campuses—is that acrosscampus differences in demand for HIGH reflect variation in the quality or accessibility of the
broker(s) assigned to each campus.
Overall, our evidence on which participants choose HIGH is consistent with the existing
literature on financial literacy. Older, more highly educated, and more highly paid employees
are more likely to be financially literate and less likely to value investment recommendations
from brokers. The lower demand for brokers by employees of business schools and economics
departments lends further support to this interpretation. In the next section, we use survey evidence to shed additional light on the demand for broker recommendations. In later sections, we
use the predicted values from the probits estimated in Table 3 to predict demand for default investment options and to explain variation in portfolio risk taking and returns.

13

D. Survey Evidence on the Demand for Broker Recommendations
OUS emailed a survey to the 3,588 current participants of the Optional Retirement Plan
in April 2012. While the survey was primarily intended to measure participant satisfaction with
existing plan design and to solicit feedback on several potential changes, we were permitted to
add several questions related to the use of brokers, financial literacy, and risk aversion. Of the
1,380 (38%) completed survey responses, 980 are from ORP participants who chose either
HIGH (313) or one of the other providers (667) during Regime 1. The survey responses for these investors provide us with another opportunity to determine why some investors choose to invest through a broker and others do not. The limitation is that we are using investors’ attitudes
and traits measured in April 2012 to assess choices made as far back as October 1996.
Table 4 Panel A reinforces the idea that investors choose HIGH when they lack the confidence to invest on their own. Investors who originally chose HIGH are significantly more likely to have “an ongoing relationship with a financial advisor” (58.7% versus 32.7%; p-value of
0.000), and significantly less likely to agree or strongly agree with the statement “I would feel
comfortable making changes to my equity and bond balance without consulting my advisor”
(24.7% versus 39.8%; p-value of 0.000). Moreover, when asked how they primarily decided on
the fraction of their portfolio to invest in equity, those choosing HIGH were significantly more
likely to select the “recommendation of an advisor” (74.3% versus 45.1%; p-value of 0.000).
Panel B reveals that 85.0% of the investors who still invest through HIGH meet with their
broker at least once a year. It also reveals that those still investing through HIGH are more likely
to implement advice quickly (43.4% versus 27.1%) and less likely to ignore advice (8.2% versus
15.2%) than other investors. Interestingly, only 23.1% of HIGH investors agree or strongly
agree with the statement “I understand how much money my advisor earns on my account.”
Panel C reinforces the idea that investors invest through brokers because they value their investment advice. It also reveals that HIGH investors seek “peace of mind” from an advisor that they
can trust, lending support to a key assumption in Gennaioli et al. (2015).
Panel D describes the weights that ORP participants place on four provider characteristics: “Access to face-to-face meetings with a financial advisor,” “The number of equity fund
choices available,” “The level of fund expenses,” and “Historical investment performance.”
Consistent with earlier answers, we find that investors who chose HIGH are significantly more
likely to rank access to face-to-face meetings as important or very important (69.9% versus
38.2%; p-value of 0.000). The fact that HIGH provides access to both broker recommendations
14

and a larger menu of investment options raises the possibility that demand for HIGH is also driven by demand for the larger menu. For example, in October 1996, HIGH offers access to 40 different investments—four times the number of investments available through LOW. (We summarize the investment options available through HIGH and LOW in the Appendix.) We find that
slightly fewer HIGH investors rate “The number of equity fund choices available” as important
or very important (57.4% versus 55.7%; p-value of 0.653), but the difference is neither economically large nor statistically significant. The fact that HIGH investors claim to place slightly less
weight on historical fund returns when choosing between providers (80.8% versus 87.2%; pvalue of 0.011) is interesting in light of our findings in section V.B. that HIGH investors appear
more likely to chase lagged returns when initially choosing which funds to invest in.
Finally, Panel E reveals only modest differences in financial literacy and risk aversion.
To measure financial literacy we include three questions that Lusardi and Mitchell (2006) created for the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), on compounding, inflation, and the risk associated with investing in a single stock versus a stock mutual fund, plus an additional question on
compounding. For each participant, we calculate the fraction of correct answers. While Lusardi
and Mitchell find that only one-third of respondents were able to correctly answer all three of
their questions, the fraction is significantly higher among our sample of younger, more highly
educated investors. Specifically, 90.0% of HIGH investors answered all four questions correctly
versus 92.8% of LOW investors. While the 2.8% difference is statistically significant at the 10percent level (p-value of 0.061), it is not economically large. In other words, to the extent that
demand for investment recommendations is driven by variation in financial literacy, that variation is not well captured by answers to standard financial literacy questions. Finally, to measure
risk aversion, we include a question from “HRS 2006 – Module 2” that asks individuals to
choose between “Job 1” (which guarantees them their current total lifetime income) and “Job 2”
(which is equally likely to cause their total lifetime income to go up by x% or to go down by
y%). Our finding that HIGH investors are less likely to prefer “Job 2” across all three scenarios
suggests that they are more risk averse, on average, but none of the differences are statistically
significant at conventional levels.

IV. Default Investments as Substitutes for Broker Recommendations?
The fact that demand for HIGH is driven by demand for recommendations on asset allocation and fund selection begs the question how would broker clients invest without their bro15

kers’ recommendations? We are able to answer this question in our setting, by exploiting OUS’s
decision to drop HIGH from the set of investment providers available to new participants in November 2007. We hypothesize that removing access to brokers recommendations from ORP will
increase demand for default investment options by those investors who would have otherwise
chosen to invest through HIGH. Because TDFs reduce their exposure to equity as the target retirement date draws near, they offer participants the opportunity to invest in a single fund that
bundles asset allocation with portfolio management. Therefore, we further hypothesize that the
substitution of default investment options for broker recommendations will be strongest when the
default is a TDF.
OUS provided us with account-level data from HIGH, LOW, and NEW. A key feature of
the account-level data is that they allow us to identify those participants who allocate 100% of
their retirement contributions to their provider’s default investment option. To allow for the possibility that it takes investors several months to actively choose their investments, for both HIGH
and LOW, we focus on participant i’s contribution five months after his initial contribution. For
NEW, which only provides us with data on quarterly account balances, we focus on participant
i’s holdings in his second quarterly statement.
Table 5 summarizes demand for default investment options during Regime 1, when
HIGH and LOW are available to new members, and Regime 2, when only LOW and NEW are
available. Note that the default investment option differs across the three providers. For HIGH,
it is a fixed annuity; for LOW, it is a money market fund; and for NEW, it is a TDF with the target retirement date chosen based on the participant’s age. Panel A focuses on the full sample of
ORP participants, and Panel B focuses on the sample of participants for which we possess the
administrative data required to estimate the model in Column (2) of Table 3 (regardless of
whether the participant joined ORP during Regime 1 or Regime 2). The fraction of participants
who demand the default option varies across the two samples of participants, but only slightly.
Table 5 reveals several interesting patterns. First, the fraction of participants that remain
invested in the default increases sharply after HIGH is dropped from the set of providers, from
less than 10% in Regime 1 to more than 40% in Regime 2. When we only focus on those participants joining during the end of Regime 1 (January 2006 through October 2007), demand for the
default is higher but still well under 20%. Second, during Regime 1, the fraction of broker clients that remain invested in the default option is less than 3%. Third, approximately 65% of the
participants who choose to invest through NEW remain invested in the TDF. The strong demand
16

for TDFs in Regime 2 is consistent with our hypothesis that TDFs are de facto substitutes for
broker recommendations. Finally, demand for LOW’s default investment option approximately
doubles between Regime 1 and Regime 2. This difference raises the possibility that some of the
participants who previously would have chosen to invest through HIGH choose LOW but lack
the confidence to allocate their retirement contributions to non-default investment options. Or,
because Regime 2 includes the onset of the financial crisis, the increased demand for LOW’s
money market fund could reflect a conscious response to declining equity market values. In contrast to either possibility, however, we find that demand for the default option in LOW is almost
exactly the same during the end of Regime 1 as it is during Regime 2 (21.9% versus 21.7%).
Table 6 provides direct evidence on the extent to which default investments are substitutes for broker recommendations. In the spirit of Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009), we use
the estimated coefficients in Column (2) of Table 3 to predict demand for brokers and then regress demand for the default investment option on the predicted demand.22 We include a separate fixed effect for the year and month of the choice, to control for average changes in the demand for defaults based on changes in market conditions, and we cluster standard errors on this
date. We find that demand for the default during Regime 1 is unrelated to predicted demand for
brokers. This likely reflects the fact that investors who are the least confident picking their own
funds self-select into HIGH, where brokers then actively recommend other investments. On the
other hand, during Regime 2, when brokers are no longer available, we find that demand for defaults is strongly related to predicted demand for brokers.
Pooling participants who choose LOW or NEW, we find that investors whose predicted
values are in the top quartile are 19.2 percentage points more likely to demand the default investment option than investors whose predicted values are in the bottom quartile, a difference
that is statistically significant at the 1-percent level. However, because this specification treats
demand for LOW’s default money market fund the same as demand for NEW’s default TDF, it
masks significant differences across the two providers. When we limit our sample to participants
who choose to invest through NEW, we find an even stronger positive relation between demand
for the default and predicted demand for brokers. The coefficient on Pr(HIGH) increases from
0.536 to 0.764. Demand for TDFs by investors in the top quartile of predicted demand for brokers is 27.5 percentage points higher than by investors in the bottom quartile, and the difference
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
22

Findings are similar when we use predicted values from Column (1), which allows us to include participants for
whom the date of the choice is not observed, but prevents us from include a fixed effect for the date of the choice.

17

remains statistically significant at the 1-percent level. Mitchell and Utkus (2012) study fund selection in a large number of 401(k) plans that do not offer access to brokers and conclude that
demand for TDFs reflects an underlying demand for investment advice. Our finding strengthens
their conclusion. More importantly, to the extent that potential broker clients invest 100% of
their retirement contributions in TDFs when brokers are not available, we are able to measure the
causal impact of broker recommendations by comparing broker clients’ portfolios to counterfactual portfolios based on TDFs.
When we limit the sample to participants who choose to invest through LOW, we do not
find that predicted demand for brokers predicts demand for the default money market fund. This
finding is also important, because it argues against the possibility that some participants responded to the lack of broker recommendations by investing in money market funds—the types of
counterfactual portfolios that Gennaioli et al. (2015) show can be dominated by broker recommendations to invest in high-fee equity funds.

V. Causal Effect of Broker Recommendations on Broker Client Portfolios
A. Testing for Differences in Risk and Return
To measure the causal impact of broker recommendations on their client portfolios we
require data on both the actual and counterfactual portfolios of ORP participants who choose to
invest through HIGH. To test the risk-taking hypothesis of Gennaioli et al. (2015), we require
data on the actual portfolios of ORP participants who choose to invest through LOW.
We combine the participant-level administrative data from OUS with two types of participant-level data from HIGH and LOW. First, we observe how each participant’s monthly ORP
contribution is allocated across the available investment options. The monthly contribution data
from HIGH begin in October 1996, when ORP is introduced, and ends in December 2009.
However, the monthly contribution data from LOW does not begin until December 1997. Since
we infer enrollment dates from the date of the first monthly retirement contribution, enrollment
dates for ORP participants investing through LOW are left censored at December 1997. Therefore, we limit any test that depends on date on the choice, such as tests for return chasing in the
initial choice of investments, to the period January 1998 through December 2009. Second, we
observe how much each participant has invested in each investment option. The account balance
data from HIGH is monthly; it begins in October 1996 and ends in December 2009. However,
the account balance data from LOW is annual; it begins in December 1998 and ends in Decem18

ber 2009. The lack of monthly account balance data from LOW limits several of our tests. Most
notably, it leads us to focus on differences in annual after-fee returns. Note that NEW only provided us with data on quarterly portfolio holdings, beginning in December 2007 and ending in
December 2009.
To calculate the actual annual after-fee return of participant i in year t, we combine data
on participant i’s dollar holdings of each investment option at the beginning of year t with data
on the after-fee returns earned by each investment option during year t. Our sample of annual
returns begins with 1999 (because account balance data from LOW begin in December 1998)
and ends with 2009. To calculate participant i’s exposure to a risk factor in year t, we weight the
estimated factor loading of investment j at the beginning of year t by the fraction of her portfolio
allocated to investment j at the beginning of year t. For investment j in year t, we estimate factor
loadings using the prior 24 monthly returns. We consider a one-factor model based on CAPM
and a six-factor model that extends the Carhart (1997) model by adding the excess return on the
MSCI Barra EAFE index, to capture exposure to international equity, and the excess return on
the Barclay U.S. Aggregate Bond index, to capture exposure to fixed income. To calculate riskadjusted returns for participant i in year t, we subtract the expected return on each factor, obtained by multiplying each portfolio’s estimated factor loading at the beginning of year t by the
return of the factor during year t. To calculate the volatility of monthly returns, we use account
balances at the beginning of year t and monthly investment returns to calculate changes in
monthly account balances during year t.
To determine participant i's counterfactual allocation to TDFs, we assume that her target
retirement date is the year in which she turns 65. Because Fidelity had the largest market share
among TDF providers at the beginning of our sample period (Balduzzi and Reuter (2015)), we
restrict the counterfactual investment options to Fidelity Freedom funds. When the target retirement year is less than or equal to 2010, we allocate 100% of her portfolio to the Fidelity Freedom 2010 fund. When the target retirement year is greater than or equal to 2040, we allocate
100% of her portfolio to the Fidelity Freedom 2040 fund. For target retirement years between
2011 and 2039, we pick the single TDF with the closest target retirement date.23 We then use
monthly fund-level data from Fidelity to calculate annual risk-adjusted returns and the volatility
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
23

In earlier drafts, we assigned portfolio assets to the Fidelity Freedom fund(s) with the target retirement date(s)
closest to the participant's target retirement date. For example, when the target retirement date was 2029, we allocated 10% of the portfolio to the Fidelity Freedom 2020 fund and 90% to the Fidelity Freedom 2030 fund. Our findings were quantitatively similar.

19

of monthly returns. Because allocations to TDFs are determined entirely by investor age, variation in counterfactual portfolios across HIGH (and LOW) investors is driven by variation in the
distribution of investor ages.
Table 7 compares actual investor portfolios to counterfactual portfolios based on TDFs.
Panel A reveals that broker clients earned annual after-fee returns during our sample period that
were 2.98% lower than they would have earned investing in TDFs (1.85% versus 4.83%). Approximately one-third of this difference can be explained by the fact that TDFs are less expensive than brokers. Broker clients in ORP pay average annual broker fees of 0.90% on top of the
management and administrative fees and charged by the underlying investments.24 Broker clients’ portfolios also exhibit more risk taking than the counterfactual portfolios, with larger differences when we focus on the volatility of monthly returns (3.81% versus 3.38%) than when we
focus on CAPM beta (0.852 versus 0.796). The size of these differences varies over time, helping to explain the difference in returns. Specifically, the counterfactual portfolios benefit from
fact that TDFs offered investors lower exposure to market risk during the start of our sample period and higher exposure to market risk during the end. As a result, the average annual after-fee
return earned by TDFs exceeded the average annual after-fee return earned by actual broker client portfolios in nine of the eleven years. Expressed as a fraction of investor-year observations,
TDFs outperform actual broker client portfolios 71.0% of the time. These comparisons imply
that brokers significantly increased annual fees, significantly decreased annual after-fee returns,
and slightly increased portfolio risk taking relative to the counterfactual portfolios.
Panel B reveals that self-directed investor earn lower annual after-fee returns than TDFs,
but the level of underperformance is 1.65% per year instead of 2.98% per year. Expressed as a
fraction of investor-year observations, TDFs outperform self-directed investors 61.1% of the
time. However, self-directed investors also bear less risk. The average CAPM beta of their actual portfolios is 0.601 (versus 0.817 for TDFs) and the average volatility of monthly returns is
2.56% (versus 3.50%). Some of the lower average risk taking is due to the fact that approximately 10% of self-directed investors remain invested in the money market fund, which is the
default investment option.

The fees that we label as broker fees are technically “mortality and risk expense charges.” According to the SEC
webpage describing variable annuities: “Profit from the mortality and expense risk charge is sometimes used to pay
the insurer's costs of selling the variable annuity, such as a commission paid to your financial professional for selling
the variable annuity to you” (http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/varannty.htm). To better isolate variation in commissions, our preferred specifications in section V.C. focus on variation in these fees across funds with the same
investment objective.

20

It follows from the comparisons above that broker clients underperform self-directed investors by 1.28% per year. This is partially due to the average annual fees of 0.90% that broker
clients pay to their brokers. However, the average difference masks significant time-series variation in relative performance. HIGH investors earn significantly higher average after-fee returns
when U.S. equity markets post strong positive returns (1999, 2003, and 2009) and significantly
lower annual after-fee returns when U.S. equity markets post strong negative returns (2000,
2001, 2002, and 2008). These patterns reinforce the conclusion that broker clients bear significantly more risk than self-directed investors. One interpretation is that brokers recommend
greater-than-optimal levels of risk, perhaps because more volatile returns make it harder for their
clients to detect underperformance. In terms of the average level of systematic risk, however,
broker client portfolios resemble TDF portfolios.
Another interpretation, in the spirit of Gennaioli et al. (2015), is that self-directed investors hold lower-than-optimal levels of risk. We explore this possibility in Table 8. In Panel A,
we test for differences in the characteristics of actual and counterfactual portfolios. The set of
characteristics is expanded to include six-factor alphas and Sharpe ratios. The odd-numbered
columns are limited to the sample of broker clients and the even-numbered columns are limited
to the sample of self-directed investors. In each case, we regress the characteristic of participant
i’s actual portfolio minus the characteristic of his counterfactual portfolio on a constant, which
captures the average difference. To allow for correlations both in participant i’s annual portfolio
returns across years and in annual portfolio returns across participants in year t, we cluster standard errors on both participant i and calendar year t. The patterns are broadly consistent with the
patterns in Table 7. Namely, broker clients earn lower annual after-free returns (-3.21%; statistically significant at the 1-percent level), lower annual risk-adjusted, after-fee returns (-2.11%; 5percent level), and lower Sharpe ratios (-0.1433; 5-percent level).25 But, we cannot reject the
hypothesis that the actual and counterfactual portfolios have the same levels of systematic and
total risk. This leads us to conclude that TDFs are just as effective as brokers in helping investors increase portfolio risk.
In Panel B, we use a different empirical strategy to estimate the causal impact of broker
recommendations. The odd-numbered columns test for differences between the actual portfolios

In Panel A, the Sharpe ratio is defined as the average difference in monthly returns of the actual and counterfactual portfolios, scaled by the standard deviation of the difference in monthly returns. In Panel B, the Sharpe ratio is
defined as the average monthly return of the actual portfolio minus the risk-free rate of return, scaled by the standard
deviation of the excess monthly return.

21

of broker clients to the actual portfolios of self-directed investor, including a separate fixed effect
for each calendar year. While the point estimates suggest that broker clients underperform by
economically significant amounts, none of the performance differences is statistically significant.
In contrast, the estimated differences in risk taking are economically and statistically significant.
The even-numbered columns are more interesting because they allow us to compare the
portfolios of broker clients and self-directed investors who are both predicted to invest through
HIGH. Each regression includes the same set of explanatory variables. To measure the average
difference in risk or return between HIGH and LOW, we include a dummy variable indicating
whether participant i invests through HIGH in year t. We also include the predicted value from
the probit predicting whether participant i invests through HIGH (from column (1) of Table 3)
interacted with dummy variables indicating whether participant i invests through HIGH or LOW.
Again, the use of the predicted value is motivated by Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009); the
interaction terms allow us to determine whether investors who are predicted to rely upon a broker and do so hold systematically different portfolios relative to investors who are predicted to
rely upon a broker but do not. To control for time-series variation in aggregate market returns,
we include a separate dummy variable for each calendar year. Because the predicted value of
choosing HIGH is constant for participant i, and because participant i’s portfolio choices are
likely to be highly correlated across years, and because portfolio returns will be highly correlated
across participants investing during the same year, we again cluster standard errors on both participant i and calendar year t.
We find that predicted demand for brokers has opposite effects on risk taking in the two
samples of investors. In column (6), a one standard deviation increase in the probability of
choosing HIGH is predicted to increase the CAPM beta of broker clients by 0.177 but decrease
the CAPM beta of self-directed investors by 0.112—a economically and statistically significant
difference of 0.289. When we shift our focus to the volatility of monthly returns, in column (4),
the findings are qualitatively similar. Higher predicted values are associated with greater volatility when the participant invests through HIGH and lower volatility when he does not. In Appendix Table A3, we restrict the sample to investors who answer the survey question about the value
they place on face-to-face meetings, scale the answer to range between 0 (“unimportant”) and 1
(“very important”), and estimate a version of Table 8 with interaction terms based on this measure instead of Pr(HIGH). We find that plan participants who answer that face-to-face advice is
more important but invest through LOW have significantly less volatile portfolio returns and
22

significantly lower CAPM betas than similar plan participants who invest through HIGH. The
differences in Table 8 and Table A3 are consistent with brokers tilting their clients toward riskier
investments to more readily mask underperformance, but also with Gennaioli et al.’s (2015) assumption that brokers reduce the disutility associated with bearing financial risk. Regardless,
our findings in Panel A suggest that TDFs are a more cost-effective way to increase risk-taking
by less experienced investors.

B. Comparing Portfolios of Participants Joining Before and After Regime Change
Our empirical strategy in the previous section allows us to measure the causal effect of
broker recommendations on client portfolios for those participants for whom TDFs and brokers
are substitutes. However, even among participants with high predicted demand for broker recommendations, some choose to invest through LOW or to invest in something other than a TDF
through NEW. Arguably, some of these participants may have benefitted from access to brokers.
Therefore, our final empirical strategy for measuring the causal effect of broker recommendations is to compare the portfolios of participants with high predicted demand for brokers who
joined before and after the regime change in November 2007.
In Table 9, we limit the sample to participants who joined ORP between January 2006
and December 2008, and for whom Pr(HIGH) is in the top quartile. Panel A focuses on participants who joined during the end of Regime 1 and Panel B focuses on those who joined during
the beginning of Regime 2. We report the fraction of participants that invest through each provider, the fraction who invest 100% in the default option (calculated the same way as in Table 5),
and several portfolio-level characteristics for calendar year 2009 calculated using portfolio holdings on December 31, 2008.26 We focus on the CAPM beta and Sharpe ratio of each participant's portfolio. We calculate averages and standard deviations across participants who join during the same regime or choose the same provider during the same regime. We also calculate the
correlation between the beta in each participant's portfolio and his or her age in December 2008.
To the extent that allocations to equity decline with age (as it does in a TDF), we expect the correlation to be negative.
During Regime 1, 39.5% of the participants with high predicted demand for brokers
choose to invest through a broker, 17.5% (29.0% of 60.5%) choose to invest 100% in LOW’s
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
26

Our decision to compare portfolio characteristics in 2009 is driven by the very small number of new participants
through December 2007 (see Table 1) and the lack of comprehensive return data for HIGH’s menu in 2010.

23

money market fund, and the remaining 43.0% choose to allocate their contributions across other
funds on LOW’s investment menu. During Regime 2, 42.6% (57.4% of 74.3%) of the participants with high predicted demand for brokers choose to invest 100% in a TDF, 9.8% (23.1% of
42.6%) choose to invest 100% in LOW’s money market fund, and the remaining 52.5% choose
to allocate their contributions across other funds on NEW’s or LOW’s investment menus. The
first thing to notice about these patterns is that observed demand for brokers within this sample
of participants is similar to observed demand for TDFs (39.5% versus 42.6%). The second thing
to notice is that demand for the money market fund declines in Regime 2. Given that those joining during Regime 2 lack of access to broker recommendations, we had expected to find higher
demand for the money market fund among investors with Pr(HIGH) in the top quartile of the
sample in Regime 2.
When we compare the characteristics of participant portfolios in 2009, we find no evidence that investors with high predicted demand for broker recommendations are worse off in
Regime 2. For those joining during Regime 2, CAPM betas are significantly higher (0.76 versus
0.59; difference significant at the 1-percent level), Sharpe ratios are significantly higher (0.40
versus 0.30; difference significant at the 5-percent level), and the correlation between CAPM
betas and participant ages is more negative (-0.30 versus -0.09). Finally, while the acrossparticipant standard deviations of CAPM beta are similar, the standard deviations of Sharpe ratios are significantly lower in Regime 2 (0.06 versus 0.38).27 In our setting, where advice is limited to asset allocation and fund selection and participants have access to TDFs, we conclude that
conflicted advice is dominated by no advice.

C. Comparing the Investment Selection of HIGH and LOW Investors
To implement an asset allocation plan, an investor must allocate her monthly retirement
contributions across an appropriate set of funds. In Table 10, we explore the impact of brokers
on fund selection. We test two hypotheses. The first concerns the agency conflict that can arise
when financially unsophisticated (or trusting) investors seek investment recommendations from
financially sophisticated intermediaries. To test for conflicted advice, we exploit across-fund
variation in broker fees in the HIGH investment menu and test whether HIGH clients are more
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
27

When we re-calculate statistics for portfolios during Regime 2 excluding participants that invest in TDFs, we find
the mean CAPM beta is 0.61, the standard deviation of the CAPM beta is 0.36, the mean Sharpe ratio is 0.38, the
standard deviation of the Sharpe ratio is 0.07, and the correlation between CAPM betas and participant ages is -0.38.

24

likely to allocate their retirement dollars to investments paying higher broker fees. Here, our research question most closely matches that of Christoffersen et al. (2013), who find that crosssectional variation in the level of broker fees helps to explain cross-sectional variation in mutual
fund flows, and Hackethal, Inderst, and Meyer (2012), who find that broker recommendations
respond to sales incentives.
The second hypothesis concerns return chasing. Within the full universe of mutual funds,
there is strong evidence that the relation between flows and performance is convex, with the best
performing mutual funds receiving a disproportionate share of the dollars.28 At the same time,
because studies like Carhart (1997) find little evidence that abnormal returns persist, investors
should not make long-term asset allocation decisions on recent fund-level returns. Therefore, we
test whether return-chasing behavior differs between broker clients and self-directed investors.
To the extent that brokers discourage return chasing, we expect to find less evidence of return
chasing by broker clients. The implicit assumption underlying this comparison is that broker clients would have been at least as likely to engage in return chasing without a broker. An alternative test is whether broker clients’ exhibit any return chasing at all since there can be no return
chasing in a portfolio that allocates 100% to a single TDF.
The dependent variable in Table 10 is the fraction of participant i’s retirement contribution that is allocated to fund j in month t. Because this variable is nonnegative, estimation is via
Tobit.29 The sample consists of all ORP participants for whom the enrollment date is uncensored, and all of the funds available to HIGH or LOW investors in month t. To focus attention
on active fund choices, we exclude those participants who invest solely in the default option.
There are three independent variables of interest. To test for conflicted advice, we include the fee
that fund j pays each year to the broker. For HIGH investments, the broker fee is a constant 55,
85 or 105 basis points; for LOW investments, it is zero. To test whether investors are sensitive
to the level of fund fees more broadly, we include the annual fees charged by the fund that are
not paid to the broker (i.e., the total annual fee minus the broker fee). Interacting the “Not Broker Fee” with dummy variables indicating whether the fund is available to HIGH or LOW investors allows us to test whether brokers steer investors away from fees from which the brokers do
not benefit. To test for return chasing, we include the net return on fund j over the prior twelve

As can be seen in the Appendix, our findings are similar when we predict which funds receive positive allocations
using probit regressions (Table A4) and linear probability models (Table A5).

25

months interacted with dummy variables that indicate whether participant i invests through
HIGH or LOW.
One set of specifications focus on initial fund choices (month 1) and another set focus on
choices two years later (month 24). All of our specifications control for the fund’s broad asset
category, turnover, and whether it is an index fund. Because we are testing for differential sensitivities to lagged returns and fees across ORP providers, in columns (1) and (4), we include a
separate fixed effect for each provider each month, so that we are comparing fund returns and
fees within each menu relative to the other funds within the same menu. In the other columns,
we include a separate fixed effect for each provider-asset category-month combination, so that
we are comparing fund returns and fees within a given menu and category. When we focus on
narrow categories instead of broad categories (e.g., small-cap value funds instead of domestic
equity funds), we limit the sample to HIGH equity funds. Standard errors are clustered on date.
We find strong evidence of conflicted investment recommendations. The coefficients on
the level of broker fees are positive and statistically significant in all six columns, and the magnitudes are economically significant. Increasing broker fees by 50 basis points (i.e., the difference
between the lowest and highest broker fee) is predicted to increase the allocation to investment j
by as much as 35.3 percentage points. The fact that broker fees continue to explain HIGH investment choices in month 24 reflects the fact that broker fees paid by investment j do not vary
in the time-series. Interestingly, we also find robust evidence that HIGH investors invest less in
funds that have high fees that are not retained by the broker. This suggests that brokers steer investors away from high-fee funds when those fees do not benefit the brokers.
The evidence on return chasing is mixed. HIGH investors consider recent returns when
selecting funds in month 1, but not in month 24. Therefore, to the extent that brokers help investors chase past returns, they only do so when initially selecting funds. However, the effects in
month 1 are economically significant. A one-standard deviation increase in recent returns is predicted to increase the allocation to investment j by 10.6 percentage points. Whether we find that
LOW investors consider recent returns depends on the specification. The baseline specifications
suggest no return chasing in month 1 but modest return chasing in month 24. The specifications
that include provider-broad asset class-month fixed effects suggest strong return chasing in
months 1 and 24. The caveat is that because the LOW menu tends to offer a single fund within
each broad asset class, the estimated coefficient is driven by allocations among the three equity
funds.
26

IV. Conclusion
While there is growing evidence that broker recommendations are conflicted, the net
benefit of broker recommendations depends on the quality of the recommendations and the
quality of the client’s counterfactual portfolio. We use unique investor-level data from the Oregon University System to estimate the causal impact of brokers on their clients’ retirement portfolios. We have four main findings.
First, we document significant differences between those investors who choose to invest
through brokers and those who do not. Employees choosing to invest through a broker are
younger, less highly educated, and less highly paid. They are also more likely to state that they
chose HIGH to meet face-to-face with a broker, and that they relied upon their broker’s recommendations when deciding how to invest. These differences beg the question of how broker clients would have invested in the absence of broker recommendations. For example, the fact that
many retirement plans historically tended not to offer one-on-one advice may help to explain
why Tang, Mitchell, Mottola and Utkus (2010) find that 401(k) plan participants presented with
well-designed investment menus still tend to hold inefficient retirement portfolios.
Second, we use time-series variation in access to brokers to identify the counterfactual
portfolios of would-be broker clients. We show that demand for default investment options more
than quadruples after HIGH is dropped from the set of providers. More importantly, we show
that the model used to predict demand for brokers when HIGH is a choice successfully predicts
demand for Fidelity’s TDF default investment option when HIGH is not a choice. Mitchell and
Utkus (2012) find that TDFs are popular with younger, lower income investors, and argue that
this popularity follows from the fact that TDFs offer both portfolio management and asset allocation. In our setting, where investment recommendations are limited to asset allocation and fund
selection, we document that TDFs are de facto substitutes for broker recommendations.
Third, when we benchmark broker client portfolios against counterfactual portfolios
based on TDFs, we find that broker recommendations lead to higher annual fees (due in part to
average annual broker fees of 0.90%), lower risk-adjusted returns, and lower Sharpe ratios, but
similar levels of exposure to market risk. In other words, within the context of a retirement plan
that offers a default investment option, choosing a reasonable TDFs as the default can decrease
annual fees without decreasing risk taking. Interestingly, when we compare participants with
high predicted demand for HIGH who join at the end of Regime 1 (39.5% of whom choose to
27

invest through HIGH) versus the beginning of Regime 2 (42.6% of whom choose to invest in
TDFs), we find additional evidence that participant portfolios constructed during Regime 2 earn
higher risk-adjusted returns. On the other hand, when we compare the outcomes of investors
with high predicted demand for broker recommendations during Regime 1 (before TDFs are
available), we find that broker clients have much higher levels of exposure to market risk. These
findings, which are consistent with Gennaioli et al. (2015), highlight the possibility that brokers
may add more value in settings that lack a sensible default option.
Finally, our account-level finding that brokers are significantly more likely to place their
clients in funds that pays larger broker fees complements the fund-level evidence of conflicted
advice in Christoffersen, et al. (2013). The observed tilt toward funds paying higher broker fees
contributes to the underperformance of broker clients’ portfolios.
Although our estimates come from a single DC retirement plan, in this study we are able
to uniquely identify the impact of brokers relative to an implementable counterfactual. This allows us to directly address the self-selection by investors to be broker advised versus selfdirected. In other words, we are able to overcome a problem that has plagued inferences of causality in the literature that asks: what is the value of advice? This is a crucial economic issue because DC retirement plans place important investment decisions in the hands of individuals,
many of whom possess limited financial knowledge (e.g., Lusardi and Mitchell (2006)). Choi,
Laibson and Madrian (2004) demonstrate that automatic enrollment had a huge impact on 401(k)
participation rates thus improving savings rates. We demonstrate that a well-chosen default investment option dominates access to broker recommendations and provides improved risk taking
in retirement portfolios. To the extent that investors derive utility from face-to-face meetings
with brokers that they do not derive from TDFs, this utility needs to be weighed against the higher fees and increased likelihood of conflicted advice. At the same time, our paper highlights the
challenges that researchers face when attempting to measure the value of financial advice in other settings, where we lack the exogenous variation needed to identify counterfactual behavior.

28

Appendix A. Financial Advice versus Financial Guidance
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) prohibits defined contribution
pension plan providers from giving their own financial advice on the investment options within
their plans.30 To comply with ERISA, HIGH uses algorithms developed by Ibbotson Associates
to generate financial advice for investors with managed accounts. However, OUS prohibits
HIGH from directly managing the “participant-directed” accounts of ORP investors. Because of
this restriction, it is more accurate to say that HIGH provides ORP participants with face-to-face
access to financial guidance.
Within an investment menu of modest size (like that available through HIGH), the distinction between financial guidance and financial advice is small. ERISA defines financial advice narrowly, as a recommendation that is immediately actionable. Under this definition, the
recommendation to “invest 100% of your retirement assets in Vanguard’s S&P 500 index fund”
is financial advice. In contrast, the recommendation to “invest 100% of your retirement assets in
a low-cost S&P 500 index fund” is financial guidance because the recommendation is personalized but not immediately actionable. This remains true even if the investment menu offers a single S&P 500 index fund. Therefore, while brokers employed by HIGH are prohibited from offering financial advice, they are allowed to offer financial guidance (and education)—a distinction that is likely lost on those seeking relationships with brokers.31

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
30

DOL Advisory Opinion 2001-09A, also known as the The SunAmerica Opinion Letter, permits defined contribution retirement plan providers to offer financial advice only when they outsource asset allocation and investment
selection decisions to independent, third party providers.
31
A recommendations that is neither personalized nor actionable, such as “academics recommend investing in lowcost, diversified mutual funds”, is classified as financial education.

Appendix B. Overview of the HIGH and LOW Investment Menus
ORP participants face different investment menus when they invest through HIGH,
LOW, and NEW. In Table A1, we report the number of investment options in each asset class at
the beginning and end of our sample period. We also report the number of investment options
that are actively managed versus passively managed, the number of investment options that are
advised by the provider versus outside asset management firms (e.g., HIGH provides access to
the HIGH Small-Cap Value Fund and the SIT Mid-Cap Growth Fund), and the default investment option, which varies in the cross section but not in the time series.
During Regime 1, HIGH offers four-times as many investment options as LOW in October 1996 (40 versus 10). Even after LOW increases its investment menu in July 2007, HIGH
still offers more than three-times as many investment options (61 versus 19). While HIGH’s investment menu grows significantly over our sample period, access to investments advised by
other firms declines significantly. For example, HIGH introduces its own Mid-Cap Growth
Fund in September 1998 and drops the SIT Mid-Cap Growth Fund in May 2006. Perhaps more
significantly, HIGH’s investment menu is skewed toward domestic equity, offering investments
with narrow investment mandates (such as Small-Cap Value or Mid-Cap Growth). This may
explain why 15% of the survey respondents who choose to invest through HIGH report never
meeting with their broker—they choose HIGH for access to equity funds rather than for access to
broker recommendations. During Regime 2, NEW offers both a larger menu than LOW (38 options versus 19 options) and relatively more domestic equity funds (16 versus 9).

We use Oregon University System payroll data to identify the investment provider for each new Optional Retirement Plan
(ORP) participant. The unit of observation is participant i in the first month that she contributes to her ORP account. Between
October 1996 and October 2007, participants have the choice of four providers: SMALL, SMALLER, LOW, and HIGH. Only
HIGH markets itself as providing personal face-to-face recommendations. Because OUS payroll data begin in January 1999,
initial contribution dates before February 1999 are left censored at January 1999. Between November 2007 and December 2009
(the end of our sample period), new ORP participants are limited to investing through LOW or NEW. The last two columns of
the table report the number of OUS employees who self-select into ORP versus PERS, the defined benefit retirement plan.

Note:

This table describes the sample of ORP participants for whom we observe salary, gender, age, job status, and self-reported
ethnicity. We report statistics for: (1) the full sample of participants joining ORP during Regime 1; (2) the sample that chooses
HIGH during Regime 1; (3) the sample that chooses LOW, SMALL, or SMALLER during Regime 1; (4) the sample that
chooses LOW during Regime 1; and (5) the full sample of participants joining ORP during Regime 2. Regime 1 begins in
October 1996 and ends in October 2007. Regime 2 begins in November 2007 and ends in December 2009. Administrative
data on the date of the choice between plans is left censored at January 1999. Job status and educational attainment are
measured in the month that the participant begins working for OUS. Age and salary are measured in the month that the plan is
chosen or in January 1999 (whichever is later). Faculty Member indicates whether participant i's job classification includes the
string "Teach/Res". Business or Economics Department indicates whether participant i works in a business school or
economics department. Other Quantitative Department indicates whether participant i's organizational description includes a
reference to computer science, engineering, life science, mathematic, medicine, physical science, or a social science other than
economics. We are missing data on educational attainment for 41.9% of the participants joining during Regime 1 and 100% of
the participants joining during Regime 2 because these data were only collected by a subset of campuses and only through
December 2004.

Note:

In this table, we predict demand for brokers by new ORP participants. The dependent variable equals one if participant i chooses
HIGH and zero if she chooses SMALL, SMALLER, or LOW. The sample in column (1) includes all ORP participants joining
between October 1996 (when ORP is created) and October 2007 (when HIGH is no longer available to new ORP participants).
Because choices made between October 1996 and January 1999 are recorded as January 1999, the sample period in other columns
begins in February 1999. Because data on participant i's educational attainment were only collected through December 2004 and
only by Oregon Institute of Technology, Oregon State, Portland State, and University of Oregon, the sample period in columns (4)
and (5) end in December 2004, and the sample is limited to participants hired by these campuses. Demographic controls include
salary, gender, age, self-declared ethnicity (the omitted category is "White"), and educational attainment (the omitted category is
"Bachelors"). We also control for whether the participant is faculty or staff, and for whether we classify the department as
business and economics, quantitative but not business or economics, and all of the rest. To control for economic conditions in the
month of the choice, columns (3) and (5) include a separate fixed effect for each year-month. To control for potential differences
in preferences across employers, we include a separate fixed effect for each campus, and for the Office of the Chancellor. The
table reports marginal effects estimated via probit. Standard errors are clustered on the date of the choice. Statistical significance
at the 10-percent, 5-percent, and 1-percent level (in two-sided tests) is denoted by *, **, and ***.

OUS sent a link to an online survey to all 3,588 current ORP participants in April 2012. In this table, we analyze the responses of the 980 participants who chose
HIGH (313) or one of the other three providers (667) between October 1996 and October 2007. The survey response rates are similar for the two groups: 17.0%
(313/1843) for HIGH and 16.8% (667/3964) for the other three providers. The fact that the survey did not require completion of all questions explains the variation
in sample size from question to question. For each question, we analyze all non-missing answers. P-values are estimated using standard errors that are robust to
heteroscedasticity.

In this table, we report the fraction of new ORP participants that invest 100% of their ORP contribution in the default investment option 5
months after their first ORP contribution. Because we lack portfolio-level data from SMALL and SMALLER, Panel A is restricted to
participants that originally chose to invest through HIGH, LOW, or NEW. Panel B is restricted to those new ORP participants for which
the date of the choice is not censored at January 1999 and for whom we possess the demographic data required to estimate Pr(HIGH) in
column (2) of Table 3. In each panel, we distinguish between Regime 1 (which includes all participants joining before November 2007),
end of Regime 1 (which includes only those joining between January 2006 and October 2007), and Regime 2 (which includes all
participants joining after October 2007).

In this table, we predict whether new ORP participant i is contributing 100% of her retirement contributions to the provider j's default investment option five months after her first
contribution to provider j. Estimation is via OLS. We estimate separate specifications for participants who have access to HIGH (i.e., participants whose first contribution is
before November 2007) and participants who do not have access to HIGH (i.e., participants whose first contribution is after October 2007). The independent variable of interest
is the predicted probability that participant i chooses HIGH based on the estimated coefficients in Column (2) of Table 3. Because Column (2) of Table 3 is restricted to
participants for whom we observe the date of the choice, we are able to include a separate fixed effect for the year-month of the choice. The last two columns are restricted to the
subset of new participants who choose to invest through NEW, which offers target-date funds as its default investment option. Standard errors are clustered on the date of the
choice. Statistical significance at the 10-percent, 5-percent, and 1-percent level (in two-sided tests) is denoted by *, **, and ***.

Note:

In this table, we summarize the actual and counterfactual portfolios of participants who join during Regime 1 and choose to
invest through HIGH or LOW. The sample includes all participants for whom we observe positive holdings of at least one
fund at the beginning of year t, and for whom we observe a birth year and month. "Annual return" is the average annual
buy-and-hold return that participant i would have earned in year t if she neither changed her holdings during year t nor
made any additional retirement contributions to ORP. For the actual portfolios, this measure is equally highly correlated
with realized portfolio returns of broker clients and self-directed investors. To determine a participant's counterfactual
allocation, we assume that her target retirement date is the year in which she turns 65, and then pick the Fidelity TDF with
the closest target retirement date (2010, 2020, 2030, or 2040). "CAPM Beta" is the weighted-average CAPM beta of the
funds held at the beginning of year t. Fund-level betas are estimated using fund-level returns over the prior 12 months.
"Volatility of Monthly Returns" is the standard deviation of realized monthly returns during calendar year t, calculated from
monthly portfolio-level returns. "Broker fee" is the average broker fee paid by broker clients in year t. It is zero for LOW
and for the counterfactual portfolios based on TDFs.

The unit of observation is the portfolio of ORP participant i in calendar year t. The sample period is 1999-2009. Portfolio characteristics include the portfolio's annual after-fee return,
volatility of monthly returns, lagged CAPM beta, six-factor alpha, and Sharpe ratio. Characteristics of actual portfolios are estimated from holdings on December 31 of the prior year,
assuming no additional retirement contributions during year t. Characteristics of counterfactual portfolios are based on the Fidelity TDF to which participant i is assigned. The OLS
regressions in Panel A separately test for differences between the actual and counterfactual portfolios of HIGH and LOW investors. The dependent variable in each regression is the
difference between the characteristics of participant i's actual and counterfactual portfolios. The numerator of the Sharpe ratio is the difference in monthly returns and the denominator is the
standard deviation of the difference in monthly returns. The OLS regressions in Panel B compare the portfolios of HIGH and LOW investors. The dependent variables are the characteristics
of participant i's actual portfolio. The independent variables include a dummy variable indicating whether participant i invests through HIGH, the predicted probability that participant i
invests through HIGH interacted with the dummy variable indicating whether participant i invests through HIGH, the predicted probability that participant i invests through HIGH interacted
with the dummy variable indicating whether participant i invests through LOW, and a full set of calendar year fixed effects. The predicted probabilities are based on the specification in
column (2) of Table 3. We report the p-value from the test that the coefficients on the two interaction terms are equal. To allow for correlations both in annual portfolio returns across
participants in year t and in participant i’s annual portfolio returns across years, we cluster standard errors on calendar year t and participant i. Statistical significance at the 10-percent,
5-percent, and 1-percent level (in two-sided tests) is denoted by *, **, and ***.

The sample is restricted to participants who joined ORP between January 2006 and December 2008, and for whom the predicted probability
of using HIGH is in the top quartile. Panel A focuses on participants who joined during the end of Regime 1 (between January 2006 and
October 2007), whereas Panel B focuses on participants who joined during the beginning of Regime 2 (November 2007 through December
2008). We calculate the market share of HIGH versus LOW or NEW versus LOW, the fraction of participants that invest 100% in the
default investment option (following the same approach as Table 5), the average CAPM beta based on portfolio holdings at the end of 2008,
the standard deviation of CAPM betas across participants, the average Sharpe ratio earned by participants during 2009, the standard
deviation of Sharpe ratios across participants, and the correlation between CAPM beta and participant age. The sample used to calculate
the average Sharpe ratio excludes five portfolios that allocate more than 50% to fixed annuities (which have positive excess returns and
standard deviations very close to zero). This includes one participant who invests through HIGH and four participants who invest through
LOW. In each panel, we report changes in fractions and means. Statistical significance at the 10-percent, 5-percent, and 1-percent level (in
two-sided tests) is denoted by *, **, and ***.

In this table, we test whether the fraction of participant i's retirement contribution to fund j responds to the level of fund j's return over the prior 12 months,
the level of fund j's fees that are paid to a broker, and the level of fund j's fees that are not paid to a broker. The sample is restricted to ORP participants who
joined during Regime 1 and chose to invest through HIGH or LOW. It includes one observation for each investment option available to a HIGH or LOW
participant in month t. We estimate one set of Tobit regressions in the first month that participant i contributes to HIGH or LOW and a comparable set of
Tobit regressions in month 24. The independent variables of interest are the lagged after-fee return of fund j interacted with dummy variables indicating
whether fund j is available through HIGH or LOW, the broker fee associated with fund j (which is zero for LOW), and the fund's annual fee minus the broker
fee. (No fund is simultaneously available through both providers.) In specifications (1) and (3), we include provider-by-date fixed effects, and dummy
variables for the broad investment category of each fund: annuity, bond, domestic equity, international equity, etc. In the other specifications, we include
provider-by-category-by-date fixed effects. In columns (2) and (4), we consider the full set of investment options and interact the provider-by-date fixed
effects with dummy variables for the full set of broad investment categories. In columns (3) and (6), we restrict the sample to domestic equity funds
available through HIGH and interact the provider-by-date fixed effects with narrow (Lipper) investment category fixed effects (e.g., large-cap growth). In
addition to controlling for fund investment objectives, returns, and fees, we control for fund j's lagged turnover and whether it is passively managed. We
exclude participants who allocate 100% of their retirement contribution to the default investment option. All variables are scaled so that 1.000 equals
1.000%. Standard errors are clustered on the date of participant i's contribution. We report the p-value of the hypotheses tests that the sensitivity to lagged
return and non-broker fee are equal for HIGH and LOW. Statistical significance at the 10-percent, 5-percent, and 1-percent level (in two-sided tests) is
denoted by *, **, and ***.

This table summarizes the investment menus available through HIGH, LOW, and NEW at the beginning and end of
Regime 1 and throughout Regime 2. HIGH makes numerous changes to its investment menu during Regime 1,
increasing the total number of investment options, but decreasing the number of investment options managed by
firms other than HIGH. LOW offers the same ten investment options between October 1996 and June 2007, adding
nine new investment options in July 2007 (shortly before the end of Regime 1 in October 2007). NEW offers the
same menu throughout Regime 2. Defaults options vary in the cross section but not the time series. The default is a
fixed annuity for HIGH, money market fund for LOW, and a target-date fund for NEW.

The probit specifications in Table A2 mirror those in Table 3. Dependent variable equals one if OUS employee i chooses PERS
as his retirement plan and zero if he chooses ORP. Independent variables are the same as in Table 3, except that we cannot
include monthly salary because we only observe monthly salary for the subset of employees who choose ORP. The table reports
marginal effects estimated via probit. Standard errors are clustered on the date of the choice. Statistical significance at the 10percent, 5-percent, and 1-percent level (in two-sided tests) is denoted by *, **, and ***.

Table A4 differs in two ways from Table 8. First, the sample is limited to participants who answered the following survey question: "When choosing between ORP investment providers assess
the importance of the following factors: Access to face to face meetings with a financial adviser". This explains why the sample sizes are between 20% to 30% of those in Table 8. Second,
we interact their answers to this question with dummy variables indicating whether the participant invests through HIGH or LOW. ORP_FACE takes on four possible values: 0
("unimportant"), 0.33 ("somewhat important"), 0.67 ("important"), and 1 ("very important"). We report the p-value from the test that the coefficients on the two interaction terms are equal. To
allow for correlations both in annual portfolio returns across participants in year t and in participant i’s annual portfolio returns across years, we cluster standard errors on calendar year t and
participant i. Statistical significance at the 10-percent, 5-percent, and 1-percent level (in two-sided tests) is denoted by *, **, and ***.
