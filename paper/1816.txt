The 11e of Extema1, National, iRegional and Industrial Factors
Variation

BSTRCI'
This paper presents a method for assessing the impact oF c:errial,
national, and sectoral shocks on Canadian employment fluctuations at the
national, industry, and provincial levels. Special attention is given to the
contribution of sectoral shocks to aggregate employment fluctuations. Shocks
which initially affect specific industries and provinces can induce aggregate
fluctuations not only because national employment is the sum of employment in
various sectors but also because of feedback across sectors.
The analysis is based on an econometric model relating employment gcowh Lu
each province and industry to the current and lagged change in U.S. output, the
lags of employment growth at the national, industry, and provincial levels, a
Canadian national shock, and shocks affecting specific industries, specific provinces, and specific province—industry pairs. The model is estimated using
annual data on Canadian employment at the province—industry level.
The results suggest that U.S. shocks are responsible for two—thirds of the
steady—state variance in the growth of Canadian national employment, while the
Canadian national shock accounts for approximately one quarter of this variance.
Taken together, industry specific, province specific and province—industry specific shocks account for about one—tenth of the variance of Canadian national
employment growth. Although U.S. shocks are the dominant influence on aggregate
employment growth in Canada, sectoral shocks account for about thirty percent of
the variance in national employment due to Canadian sources.
Estimates of the contribution of U.S., Canadian national, industry, and
provincial shocks to the variance of employment in specific industries and provinces are also provided.

1. Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to study the sources of employment fluc-

tuations in Canada. To this end, we first present a methodology for investigating the role of aggregate and disaggregate shocks in determining variation in

employment grth at the national, regional, and industry levels. Aggregate
shocks may arise from either domestic or external sources and are assumed to
affect all sectors of the economy, although the impact of these shocks may

differ across industries. Disaggregate shocks are specific to particular sectors of the economy. We then apply this methodology to the Canadian economy
using annual employment data disaggregated by province and industry for the
period 1961—1982.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the motivation for
our study. Section 3 presents a disaggregate time series model of employment
and demonstrates how the model may be used to analyze the sources of employment

variation. In Section 4 we discuss the econometric meLhods used to estimate the
employment model. In Section 5 we describe the data used for estimation and
present our empirical results. We conclude the paper in Section 6.

2. Motivation
Our research is motivated by two related issues. The first concerns the
relative importance of disaggregate shocks and aggregate shocks in booms and

recessions which affect particular industries and regions. To what degree do
recessions in a particular industry or a particular region arise from sectoral

sources and thus have a sectoral solution? To what degree do recessions in par—
ticular industrte.s or regions arise from differences across sectors in the

response to an economy wide shock? Many studies of employment growth in a particular region or industry have examined the effects of sector specific influences such as trade policy, local government expenditures and taxes, while

—2—

controlling for aggregate determinants of economic activity. Consequently, our
interest in the first question does not require much explanation. We hope to
contribute to this literature by providing a comprehensive assessment of the

extent to which employment fluctuations in various industries and provinces are
a sectoral phenomena.

The second Issue that motivates our work concerns the contribution of sec-

tor specific disturbances to aggregate fluctuations in employment growth. This
issue has received little attention in the literature. Most macroeconomic
studies have Investigated the relative Importance in business cycles of aggregate supply shocks or demand shocks resulting from changes in monetary and
fiscal policy, exogenous shifts in investment demand, changes in consumer confidence, shifts in the supply of raw materials and productivity shocks.1
Unfortunately, attempts to explain aggregate economic fluctuations in terms of a
simple unified model emphasizing a few variables have not been very successful,

and a consensus has not emerged on the relative importance of the above factors
in business cycles.

Better theories, econometric methods and data will undoub-

tedly lead to improved aggregate models. However, the success of such models is
bounded to the extent that business fluctuations are complex phenomena caused by

many factors.2 For this reason, we wish to obtain empirical evidence on the
contribution of a diverse set of disaggregate shocks to aggregate fluctuations.
Our focus on disaggregate shocks is partially inspired by the Important

work of Lillen (l982a, l982b) on the effect of changes in the dispersion of sec—

toral shocks on the natural rate of unemployment. (See also Medoff (1983),
Lilien and Hall (1984), and Abraham and Katz (1985).) Many economists, including
Archibald (1971), Phelps (1971) and Lucas and Prescott (1974), have hypothesized

—3—

that the amount of frictional and "structural" unemployment in the economy is
affected by the rate of change in employment demand in individual firms,

industries, and regions. Essentially, the variance in sectoral shocks affects
the amount of labor which is in the process of being reallocated across sectors.
Lilien hypothesized that the dispersion of sectoral shocks fluctuates over time,
leading to variation in both the natural rate and the level of unemployment.
The results of empirical work on this hypothesis are mixed.3
In contrast to Lilien's emphasis on a linkage between the variance of sec—
toral shocks and aggregate fluctuations, we investigate the possibility that

random fluctuations in the levels (as opposed to the variance) of sectoral
shocks induce variation in aggregate employment simply because aggregate employ—

ment is a weighted sum of employment in various sectors. If sector specific
shocks have a variance that is large relative to aggregate shocks, then sectoral
shocks will obviously play an important role in fluctuations of employment

grcMth within a particular sector. However, if the variance of an appropriately
weighted average of sector specific disturbances is sufficiently large, then
taken together, these shocks may play a significant role in aggregate employment

fluctuations. We refer to this role of sectoral shocks as the "collective
impact" hypothesis.

For example, consider an economy with five sectors of equal size. Assume
that both the aggregate shock and the sectoral shocks are serially uncorrelated,
and that there are rio feedbacks from past employment changes to current employ-

ment changes. Assume further that all shocks are independent. If the variance
of the aggregate shock is one half of the variance of the sectoral shocks, and
the sectoral shocks have equal variances, then the correlation of employment

—4--

between sectors would be 1/3 for all pairs of sectors. In this case, the aggregate shock will account for 71.4% of the variance of national employment and the

sectoral shocks will account for 28.6% of this variance. If the sectors are of
unequal size, the sectoral shocks will be even more important.

While there clearly exists a potential role for disaggregate shocks in
aggregate fluctuations via the "collective impact" mechanism, the empirical

importance of such shocks is unclear. The influential studies of Burns and
Mitchell (1946) and Mitchell (1951) provide evidence that economic activity in

various industries and regions moves together. Lehmann (1982) uses modern time
series techniques to re—analyze some of the series studied by Mitchell and con-

firms the earlier findings. As Lucas (1977) emphasizes, results of this type
lend support to the view that simple aggregative models ultimately will be able
to explain business cycles.

On the other hand, the strength and stability of co—movements in employment

across sectors of the economy should not be exagerated. Many economists have
noted a diversity in employment growth across regions and industries in both
the U.S. and Canada over the past two decades, a diversity which is only par-

tially due to differences in trend growth rates. The numbers above the diagonal
in Table 1 are the simple correlations of the annual changes in the log of

employment across Canadian one—digit SIC Industries. The numbers below the
diagonal are the partial correlations after controlling for external shocks as
proxied by the current value and first lag of the change in the log of real U.S

GNP. The simple correlations are less than .5 in 23 out of 36 cases, although
the results also show substantial positive correlations between a number of the
industry pairs. While the partial correlations indicate the presence of a corn—

—5—

mon domestic disturbance, they also indicate that there is considerable diver-

sity in employment fluctuations across industries. Table 2 presents the simple
and partial correlations (controlling for the current and lagged value of U.S.

GNP) for the changes in the log of provincial employment. The correlations for
the provinces are considerably stronger than those for the industries.
The limited evidence In these tables suggests that it is unlikely that

disaggregate shocks are the main source of aggregate fluctuations. However

they

also suggest that sectoral shocks play a large enough role in employment behavior at the sectoral level to warrant careful study as a partial explanation for

aggregate fluctuations, especially since feedback effects (across sectors) of
sector specific shocks will contribute to these correlations.

We are unaware of any systemmatic attempt to measure the overall contribution of industry specific, region specific, and industry—region specific shocks

to aggregate fluctuations. This may reflect, in part, the role played by
idiosyncratic shocks in many econoiaic models growing out of the work of Phelps

(1970) and Lucas (1972, 1977). In these models, idiosyncratic shocks are a
source of noise which prevents individuals inferring the level of the money
supply, the economy wide price level and aggregate economic activity from a

limited information set on prices and output.4 The variance of these shocks may
affect the natural rate of unemployment (see especially Lucas and Pr*c,tt
(1974)) and the responsiveness of output to monetary shocks. However, these
models assume that the shocks are sufficiently independent and affect units

which are sufficiently small so as to wash out in the aggregate. On the other
hand, some economists (Black (1982), Long and Plosser (1983)) have argued that
"real" shocks, rather than monetary shocks, are the dominant force in economic

—6—

fluctuations. Within such a framework, it is natural to consider shocks
directly affecting the demand for or supply of particular goods. Long and
Plosser (1983) present a 'real business cycle" model in ..yhich independent sec—

toral shocks induce correlation in output across sectors because of feedback

effects. However, they do not attempt to measure the relative importance of
sectoral and aggregate shocks. Our empirical model bears some similarity to
theirs, although our model is consistent with an important role for aggregate
shocks (including monetary shocks) which influence all sectors as well shocks to

specific sectors. Further, the feedback effects in our model could arise from
many sources.

There are a number of possible approaches to studying the sources of

employment fluctuations. One approach is to first obtain measures of the different sources of external, national, industry specific, province specific, and

province—industry specific shocks. One could then estimate an econometric model
relating these measures to employment at various levels of aggregation and per-

form an analysis of variance. In general, data limitations and lack of adequate
degrees of freedom in time series data limit the feasibility of treating the

sources of shocks as observed variables. Most studies of specific industries or
regions treat national output as exogenous rather than investigate feedbacks

from the industry or region to national output. (See Bolton (1980).) While
effects of specific shocks such as auto strikes, coal strikes, import quotas,

etc. on economic activity have been investigated using large scale econometric
models, a summary of the contribution of these shocks has not been calculated.

An alternative approach is to examine a pure time series model of the

employment process. Vector autoregressive models have been fruitfully applied

—7—

to study the sources of variation in economic time series. (See Sims (1980) and
Ashenfelter and Card (1982).) Unfortunately, these methods are not well suited
to analysis at the sectoral level because they involve too many parameters in

large systems of equations (see below). Moreover, the VAR representation of a
time series combines the dynamic behavior arising from structural dependence of
the economic time series upon its past values and from serial correlation in the

disturbances to the time series. The "innovations" in the VAR model do not
necessarily correspond to the unobserved variables which drive the economic
time series conditional upon feedback effects from past values of the time

series. In using an unrestricted VAR model, one assumes that shocks to the economy are uncorrelated (or defines the shock as the residual after all serial

correlation has been eliminated From the error term). This restricts the dynamics of the model to come from feedback effects, and leaves no role for dynamics

arising from serially correlated shocks. However, in future work it would be
useful to compare the results on the importance of various shocks reported here
to those obtained using a suitably restricted VAR model.

Index models of the type used by Sargent and Sims (1975), Engle and Watson
(1981), and Lehmann (1982) represent another possible approach to the problem.

These models attempt to explain the behavior of a vector of economic time series
in terms of a small set of unobservable variables and a set of idiosyncratic

error components which are specific to the particular series. All of the above
studies rule out feedback from past values of the economic time series to the

current values. They attribute the dynamic behavior of economic time series to
serial correlation in the unobserved factors. However, the general class of
index models discussed in Jatson and Engle (1982) incorporates direct feedback

—8—

from past values of the observed variables to the current values as well as

serial correlation in the unobserved variables which drive the system. The
model which we estimate falls into this class. Basically, we impose some strong
assumptions about the way in which employment in a particular province and
industry is affected by the lagged values of the employment in other provinces

and industries. These assumptions are necessitated by the size of our system
and available data. We also assume that shocks to employment arise from current
and lagged changes in U.S. GNP as well as:

(a) an unobserved national component

which affects employment in all industries and provinces with industry specific
coefficients; (b) a set of unobserved industry components; (c) a set of unobserved province specific components which affects all industries in the respective province with industry specific coefficients; and (d) a component which

affects employment only in the particular province and industry. To some
extent, we allow for serial correlation in these components.

Althigh we emphasize that our model is not a structural economic model, it
is useful to discuss both the possible sources of the industry and region specific shocks that we analyze and the possible explanations for the effect of pre-

vious employment growth on current employment growth.5 Industry and region
specific shocks may affect either the demand or supply side of employment,
although we believe that in general the demand effects will he more important.

Changes in tastes may shift the demand curve for the output of an industry out-

ward and increase its demand for labor. Alternatively, positive shocks in the
price of raw materials may lower an industry's equilibrium output and reduce its

derived demand for labor. Industry specific productivity shocks or technological change may also shift the industry demand for labor.

—9—

In our view, region specific shocks are most likely to reflect changes in

government policy. Alternate spending and taxation policies of provincial
governments can clearly shift the demand for labor in a given region,6 while

changes in minimum wage laws may shift the effective supply of labor in a given

region. Regional development programs carried out by the Federal government
also can affect the demand for labor, while changes in the treatment of regional
unemployment in the unemployment insurance system may affect labor supply in a
given region.

The large literature on "propagation mechanisms" for business cycles

suggests a variety of explanations for the feedback effects in the model ana—

lyzed below. The simplest explanation involves the fact that output demands of
different industries and regions are interrelated through the production pro-

cess. A positive shock to manufacturing leads, in future periods, to an
increase in the demand for the output of mining. Further, a demand shock
raising employment and wages in a particular industry or region can increase
(with a lag) the demand of consumers and firms for goods produced in other

industries or regions. (Long and Plosser (1983) emphasize factors such as
these.) The need for time to build (Kydland and Prescott (1982)) and costs of
adjustment In investment and hiring decisions affect the adjustment process in
the econany, as does the time required for workers to move between industries

and regions in response to demand shifts. Empirically sorting out the role of
these mechanisms is an extremely challenging research problem, and we do not
address it here.

3. An Econometric Model for the Analysis of Employment Variation
In this section we present the econometric model of employment variation

—10—

which serves as the basis for our empirical work. We first present a general
time series specification of employment at the province—industry level. The
general model consists of an unrestricted relationship between employment in a
given province—industry pair and lagged employment in all other province—

industry pairs, and an unrestricted disturbance. We then discuss a series of
restrictions which are placed upon the form of the feedback in employment among

industry—province pairs to obtain an estimable model. Next we consider a decomposition of the employment disturbance into national, province, industry, and

province—industry components. Finally, we show how estimates off the model can
be used to measure the contribution of each type of dLsturbance to the variance
in the growth of employment at the national, province, industry and province—

levels.

which may be serially correlated.7 Assuming for simplicity that only the

Below we work

with nine one—digit industries and six provinces, so this amounts to 54 lag

coefficients for each province—industry pair. Since we have only 19 time series
observations for each equation after forming the employment change measures and

lagged values, we cannot estimate the model as it stands. Consequently, we must

—1 4—

but found that it made little difference to our

results.

Second, our use of national and provincial lagged employment may

not

cap-

ture sufficiently the effects of regional proximity. Also, feedback between
different industries in different provinces may depend upon the particular

industries involved. The above specification permits the effects of the lag of
Ontario manufacturing and the lag of Ontario services on mining in Alberta to
differ only to the extent that the fractions of Canadian employment accounted
for by employment in manufacturing and by employment in services in Ontario

differ. (See (7a).)
Third, if the industrial compositions of provinces were the same, the spe-

cification would imply that the effect of lagged employment changes for industries

in the same province is independent of the size of the province. For industries
with national markets, one might expect the influence of lagged employment in
the province to be less in small provinces than in large ones.
In any econometric study, one must balance a desire for generality in the
model against the limitations that the data place on empirical identification.

Our preliminary experiments indicated that the usable variation in the data is
not sufficient to identify specifications more complex than (6), and so this
specification, with some minor variations, forms

the basis

for our empirical

work.9
3.2 Restrictions on the Error Structure of the Model

of province—industry shocks are mutually

uncorrelated at all leads and lags. It is natural to decompose the variance of
the employment disturbances in this way. However, in our empirical work we also
make the stronger assumption that the industry shocks
across industries, that the province shocks

v are

vinces, and that the province—industry shocks

are uncorrej.ated

uncorrelated across pro—
are uncorrelated across

province and industry pairs.

Identifying restrictions are necessary to estimate any factor model. For
example, in (8) one can trivially exhaust all degrees of freedom simply by

allowing the idiosyncratic errors u. to have an unrestricted covariance
matrix. In our case, the orthogonality assumptions allow us to identify the
model, and our interpretation of the results is conditional on these assump-

tions. Our approach can be interpreted as taking a model with national shocks

—16—

as the baseline, and then asking whether orthogonal industry and provincial
shocks also affect the variation in employment growth at the national,

industrial or provincial levels in an economically meaningful way. We believe
that this is a reasonable approach, since it will be extremely difficult to
distinguish, (either theoretically or empirically) a national shock-model

(perhaps with multiple indices of national shocks) from a model which allows for
correlated industrial and provincial shocks.
The assumption that there is only one index of shocks at each level is

another identifying restriction. Given the number of candidates for national
shocks, this may be an especially strong assumption at the national level. On
the other hand, we do allow for observable aggregate shocks arising from the

United States. Moreover, the use of one (unobserved) national shock gives sec—
toral shocks their best chance to play a role in variations in aggregate econo-

mic activity. If sectoral shocks do not play a major role in this model, for
our purposes there seems little point in moving to a model with several unobservable national shocks.

The expressions for the variance of ct '

Canadian employment at the national, industry and province levels.

4. EstimatIon Methodology
Our model consists of 54 parameters which enter linearly in (6) as well as

the 32 parameters which enter nonlinearly in (8).10 We carry out the estimation in two

stages.

First, we estimate the regression parameters of (6) using

instrumental variables and least squares procedures. The resulting parameter
estimates are used to provide estimates

4.1 Estimation of the Coefficients on Lagged Employment, US , and

US1

Since the parameters of (6) are constant across provinces but differ across
industries, it is useful to begin by focusing on estimating the parameters for a

specific industry. The appropriate method of estimation depends on one's assump-

and interpretation of (6). Vhile (6) is not a structural equation (in the
conventional sense), one could argue that the restrictions on II implied by (6)
tions

are

appropriate once tl has been purged of any correlation with

from

arising

autocorrelation in the components of the error. Further, one could argue

that ignoring this correlation will diminish the role of these components in
explaining the variance of

.

In

this case, TSLS should be used for estima—

—23—

tion.

On the other hand, OLS will be the appropriate estimation strategy if one

is willing to assume that the components of

are serially uncorrelated or if

one simply interprets (6) as a restricted projection and

as the residual

from this projection. Fortunately, our qualitative results are insensitive to
whether we use OLS or TSLS to estimate (6).

To implement the TSLS procedure, we assume that the national shock

Consequently such linear

Given our stochastic assumptions, we are left with a large number of

potential instrumental variables. We use the following set of instrumental variables:

from industry specific regressions of these variables

(across provinces and time periods) against the above set of instrumental

variables. Since the parameter r is common to all industries, we estimate

quasidifferencing eliminates serial correlation arising from

posite error

will not be white noise unless all of the components of

V(S) is a 1485 x 1485 matrix. As a result, evaluating expressions

involving V(S) can be extremely demanding in terms of computer time and
storage, and this limits our options in choosing an estimation strategy.

To reduce the computational burden (and because T is much smaller than K)
we use a large sample normality approximation and

to estimate

V(S).14 Further, we do not attempt to improve the efficiency of our
estimates of

since this procedure requires repeatedly evaluating expressions involving

using GLS instead of OLS when estimating a regression model.) The lack of an
optimal minimum distance estimator rules out performing standard chi—square
goodness of fit tests, and alternatives such as those suggested by Newey

—26—

(1985a) are computationally infeasible.16 Instead, below we present informal
evidence concerning goodness of fit.

Empirical

Analysis

This section presents the empirical results. It is organized as follows.
Section 5.1 describes the data. Section 5.2 discusses the estimates of the
regression parameters of the model. Section 5.3 discusses the estimates of the
coefficients on the national and province specific shocks and the variances of

the national, provincial, industry, and province—industry shocks. In Section 5.4,
we use the moving average representation of our model and the parameter estimates from 5.2 and 5.3 to illustrate the cumulative impact of various shocks on

Canadian employment growth at the national and industrial levels. In Section
5.5, we estimate the contribution of the respective shocks to the variance of
the growth in Canadian national employment, industrial employment and provincial
employment.

5.1 Data
As mentioned earlier, the data for the study are annual employment in
Canada disaggregated by one digit SIC industry (Forestry, Mining, Manufacturing,

Construction, Transportation, Trade, Finance, Services, and Government) and by

province. Employment in the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Prince Edward
Island

are

excluded. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are combined in the analy-

sis, as are Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Although it would have been desirable to
disaggregate further along industry lines, particularly in manufacturing and
construction, the necessary data are not available by province.

The data are available from 1961
years

to

1982

and are taken from CANSIM. Three

are lost in the construction of first difference and lagged values of the

—27—

variables. Consequently, the effective saniple for estimation covers

l964_1982.17
Table 3 presents a summary of the average composition during our sample

period of employment in Canada by industry and province.18 Manufacturing, services and trade are the largest sectors, with 24.5, 27.9 and 16.8 percent of

employment respectively. Forestry and Mining account for only 1.0 and 1.9 percent of employment. Newfoundland accounts for only 1.6 percent of employment in
Canada. It is important to note that our estimation procedure gives equal
weight to Newfoundland in the estimation of many of the parameters. This is
probably undesirable, especially in light of the large estimated variance of

v for

Newfoundland.19 Consequently, we focus upon estimates of the model with

Newfoundland excluded.

deviations of provincial employment

5.2 Estimates of the Regression Parameters
We initially estimated (6) by nonlinear TSLS, using the instrumental

variables discussed in Section 4. Since we obtained an estimate of the auto—

correlation parameter r of only —.05, we set r equal to 0 and used OLS and
TSLS to estimate (6). The TSLS results are reported in Table 4a, and the OLS

estimates are reported in Table 4b. The estimated coefficients on

US and

US1 Indicate that U.S. GNP has a strong effect on forestry, manufacturing,
construction, and a moderate effect on trade and finance. The (relatively) weak
response of mining

to

U.S. GNP

is

surprising. U.S. GNP

has

a positive impact

on all sectors except government. To determine the overall impact of U.S. GNP

on employment in a given industry It is necessary to take into account feedback

—28—

effects through past employment changes. We do this in Section 5.4.
The effects of lagged provincial employment, lagged Canadian employment,

and lagged industry employment on the dynamic behavior of employment growth are
interdependent, and thus it is very difficult to interpret the coefficients of

these variables by themselves. [n Section 5.4 we present a discussion of the
moving average representation of the response of employment to various distur-

bances. However, a few observations can be made at this point. First, note
that the TSLS and OLS point estimates are generally similar, but they do differ

by large amounts in several cases. As one would expect, the reported standard
errors, (which are approximate at best for the reasons discussed in footnote
11), are usually considerably larger for the TSLS estimates than for the OLS

estimates. They are especially large for forestry, mining, and construction as
a result of the large residual variances for these equations.

We find that the lagged change in provincial employment has a substantial

positive effect on the current employment change in most industries. The
effect is especially large in mining, construction, transport, and finance.

The results are consistent with the notion that there is substantial interdepen-

dence among industries at the regional level. Indeed, we find the TSLS estimate
of the response of mining to lagged provincial employment to be unreasonably

large. The effect of lagged own industry employment is smaller in absolute
value in most cases and mixed in sign. The response of employment to the lagged
change in Canadian employment is negative for all industries except construction,

government and services. The

large

but

point estimate for construction is very

is subject to a very large standard error.

Neither

the inclusion of the own

lag of the employment change nor the

—29—

inclusion

of a provincial trend significantly affects the results.21

5.3 The Employment Responses to National, Province, and Industry Shocks
Table 5a reports estimates of the response coefficients

f1 , g1

,

to

the

national and provincial shocks, as well as estimates of the variances of the

national, industry, and provincial shocks for the TSLS residuals. Table 5b
reports the corresponding results for the OLS residuals. The results are similar, and we focus upon the OLS results. We have normalized the response of
forestry to the national and provincial shocks to be 1. The response of each
industry

The

to the industry specific shocks is normalized to 1

for

all industries.

responses to the national shock are estimated relatively precisely

and are in accord with a priori expectations. Forestry, mining, and cons truc—

tion

are the most responsive to the national shock, followed by manufacturing

and transportation. Trade, finance, and services are only about 1/4 as responsive to a national shock as construction. Government has a small negative
response, which would be consistent with counter—cyclical use of manpower
programs (among other explanations).

The variances of some of the industry specific shocks are substantial given

that the response coefficients have been normalized to one in each industry. A
number of these point estimates have relatively small standard errors. By comparing the point estimate for the industry specific variance to the product of
the estimate of the variance of the national shock and the square of the estimated national response coefficient for the particular industry, one may assess
the relative importance of national and industry shocks in the covariance of

across provinces for the industry. The industry specific shock is more
important than the national shock for finance, services, trade and government.

—30—

However, the national shock is more important for mining, manufacturing (in the

OLS case), forestry and construction, even though the variances of the mining
and manufacturing industry specific shocks are quite large. (The estimated
variance for forestry is slightly negative, but this estimate is only marginally
larger than its standard error.)

The parameter estimates for the provincial shocks are imprecise. The large
response coefficients for forestry and mining are somewhat surprising given that
one would expect these industries to have national or international markets.

These large point estimates could indicate a strong impact of provincial policy

changes on mining and forestry. The number of negative point estimates for
variance parameters is somewhat trcubling and may reflect misspecification. On
the other hand, all of these estimates are associated with large standard
errors, and thus may simply reflect sampling error.
Since we cannot calculate a chi—square goodness—of—fit test, in Table 6 we

compare the predicted values of the covariances of the errors across industry
and province pairs (when the province is different) based upon the parameter
estimates in Table 5b to the unrestricted estimates, which are the average
value across different provinces of the covariance for the given industry pairs.

The restricted and unrestricted estimates correspond reasonably closely.22
We considered several other modifications when estimating the parameters

of the error components model. We estimated the parameters from the moment

matrices based on the residuals for i) the case where the own lag of Y
pit
enters (6) and, ii) the case where a provincial trend enters (6). We also re—
estimated the parameters while constraining to zero the variances that were

estimated as negative numbers in Table 5a.23 None of these modifications had

—31—

a significant effect on the parameter estimates.

5.4 Dynamic Response of Employment Growth
In this section we use our parameter estimates and the moving

average

representation (16) to illustrate the cumulative impact of various shocks to

Canadian employment growth at the national and industry levels. We report
results based on the OLS estimates (Newfoundland excluded) but the general

results are not sensitive to changing the estimation method or sample. The time
horizon refers to the number of years following the shock.

In Table 7a, we trace out the response of the growth rate in Canadian
employment at the national and industry levels to a one time, one standard

deviation increase in 6ust (the size of the increase is .0246). In terms of
national employment, the growth rate rises above its initial level for years 0

through 3, at which point the effect of the US shock essentially stops. In
several industries the impact of the shock is always positive, while in
forestry, manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, construction and finance the

effect in later years beces negative before the growth rate returns to its
initial value. Initially the shock has

a

small negative effect on government,

followed by an increase in employment growth in this industry.

Table 7b indicates the effect of a one time, one standard deviation

increase in the national shock c on the growth rate of national and
industry employment. (The size of the hypothetical shock is .0339). The
response pattern to this experiment is qualitatively similar to the response
pattern to the US shock.
Table 7c reports the response of the growth rate of national employment to
a one time rise in each industry

specific

shock. The size of the hypothetical

—32—

shock is set equal to the square root of the industry specific variance

(reported in Table 5b). If the point estimate of the industry's variance is
negative, the shock is set equal to the square root of the average of the esti-

mated variances of the industry specific shocks reported in Table 5b.24 (In the
latter case the size of the shock equals .0111.) For example, column 1 indicates the impact on national employment growth of a one—time, one standard

deviation increase in the Forestry specific shock. In general, national
employment growth rises in response to the industry shocks, but these effects

disappear after three years. The responses are smaller than the response to a
one standard deviation national shock.
In Table 7d, we show the impact on the growth rate of each industry's

employment of a one—time, one standard deviation shock to each industry's error
(For each industry the shock is the same as in Table 7c.) The impact

of the shock is generally positive and virtually all effects disappear after

five years. A comparison of Tables 7d and 7c establishes that the industry
shock has a nuch larger impact on the specific industry than on national

employment growth. The response to an industry shock is positively related to
the weight of the industry in national employment growth and to the size of the
shock.

Finally, in Table 7e we illustrate the impact on employment growth of one

experiment involving the provincial shocks. Specifically, we calculate the
impact on national and industry employment growth of a one time increase in the
provincial error for Nova Scotia/New Brunswick equal to .0281, the square root

of the average of the estimated regional variances reported in Table 5b. We
then repeat the calculation for the other provincial shocks, again using the

—33-.

square root of the average value of the regional variances.

In Table 7e, we

report the average effect on the employment growth rates of these seven experi-

ments. The effect of the provincial shocks on national employment essentially
disappears after three years. Again there are differences in the size and
timing of the industry responses to the provincial shock.

The analysis of the dynamic response carried out in this section and the
steady state variance decompositions reported in the next section are based on

the assumption that all shocks are white noise errors. Given the estimates of
the residuals, we checked for autocorrelation in the industrial and provincial

shocks. Assuming a constant autocorrelation parameter across industries, we
obtained an estimate of approximately —.02 for this parameter. We obtained an
estimate of —.18 for the provincial autocorrelation parameter. When we recalculated the response coefficients and the variance decompositions to allow for
autocorrelation in the industrial and provincial shocks, the results were quite
similar.

5.5 Accounting for the Variance in Canadian Empyment
We now discuss estimates of the contributions of various sources to the
variance in employment growth at the national, industry, and provincial levels.

Using (11) from Section 3, we compute the contribution of the various shocks to

the variance of the innovation in Y

up1

In these calculations (and the ones that follow) we have set negative

variances to zero, although this makes little difference in practice. For the
only case that we considered, (TSLS estimation, no Newfoundland data), we found
that using minimum distance estimates where these negative parameters were

constrained to zero had no significant impact on the calculations. The first

r of the table indicates that the US shock and the Canadian national shock
account for 43.2% and 43.8% (respectively) of the variance in the innovation of

national employment. The industry shocks, the provincial shocks, and the
province—industry shocks account for 6.6%, 3.7%, and 2.9% of this variance,

respectively. (The contributions sum

to

100.2% because of rounding.) Sectoral

shocks represent for only 13.2% of Canadian employment fluctuations due to all

sources, but account for 23.1% of the variance due to Canadian sources. Thus,
the results indicate that while sectoral shocks play only a modest role in
national employment fluctuations, they play a more significant role in Canadian
employment fluctuations due to Canadian sources.

The results in Table 8b for the steady state variances tell a similar

story. The U.S. and Canadian shocks account, respectively, for 61.7% and 26.8%
of the national variance. The industry shocks, the province shocks, and the
province—industry shocks account, respectively, for 6.4%, 2.7% and 2.4% of the

steady state variance in Canadian employment growth. Sectoral shocks account

—35—

for 11.5% of the steady—state variance due to all sources and 30.0% of the

variance due to Canadian sources. Thus, the dominant influences are the US
shock and (to a lesser extent) the Canadian national shock. Nevertheless, the
sectoral shocks contri1ite a significant fraction of the variance which arises

from Canadian sources. One might speculate that sectoral shocks would be more
important in a more closed economy, such as that of the U.S.

The results in the tables show considerable differences in the relative

importance of the shocks to the total industry variances. In no case are provincial shocks very important. The results on the importance of the province—
industry shocks to the industry variances are sensitive to the estimation

procedure and whether or not Newfoundland is included. However, in all cases
these shocks contribute more than 20% of the steady—state variance of Forestry,

Mining, and Government and more than 10% for Trade and Finance. For several
industries, industry shocks account for a non—trivial fraction of the employment
innovations, with transportation and forestry being exceptions.

The industry shocks account for relatively little of the variation in pro-

vincial employment grcth, although these results are somewhat sensitive to the
esUniation method and sample. The contribution of industry shocks to both the
innovation and steady—state variance of provincial employment growth is similar
to their contrilxition to the national employment variance. Both province shocks
and industry—province shocks play a more important role at the provincial level
than at the national level.

In summary, we have estimated the model using both TSLS and OLS estimation
procedures and have performed the analysis both with and without data on
Newfoundland.

We have also considered separately a11ocing for a lagged depen—

—36—

dent variable in (6) and allowing serial correlation in the nationaland see—
toral shocks. We have investigated different treatments of negative point
estimates of some of the variances. The results reported above are representative of our results in each of the various cases.25

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a method for assessing the contribution of

various shocks to the variance of Canadian employment growth at the national,

industry, and provincial levels. Specifically, this procedure analyzes the
relative degree to which U.S. shocks, Canadian national shocks, and shocks to
specific industries, specific provinces and specific province—industry pairs

cause fluctuations in employment growth at various levels of aggregation. We
apply this methodology to annual data on Canadian employment at the industry—

province level. Our results suggest U.S. shocks are responsible for approximately two—thirds of the steady—state variance in the growth of national
employment, while the Canadian national shock acccxxnts for approximately a

quarter of this variance. Taken together, industry specific, province specific
and province—industry specific shocks account for approximately a tenth of the

variance in Canadian employment growth. Thus our analysis indicates that the
dominant influences on aggregate employment growth in Canada are US shocks, and
to a lessor

to

extent, national shocks. Nevertheless, sectoral shocks would appear

account for a substantial fraction of the variance in national employment due

to Canadian sources. Industry specific shocks play an economically significant
role in several industries, while provincial shocks play an important role in
the

variance of employment growth in most provinces. Idiosyncratic shocks are

also important in several provinces and industries.

—37—

We view our study as a first approach to the problem, and there is a large
agenda for future research. Within the present framework, development of a
feasible weighted minimum distance would be very useful. Expanding the analysis
to incorporate monthly or quarterly data would involve significant complica-

tions, but would also offer substantial benefits. First, the greater sample
sizes would enable us to alloq for a more flexible feedback mechanism between

current and lagged employment. Second, the lower degree of time aggregation
would allx us to more sharply separate sectoral shocks from the national shock.
(For example, a specific shock to Ontario in January may look very much like a

national shock by mid—year.) Finally, it would be very interesting to apply
this approach to the U.S. economy, where one would expect the role of external
shocks to be much smaller.

1Examples of studies using structural or reduced form econometric models to
investigate the role of one or more of these factors are Barro (1977, 1978),

Mlshkin (1984) and Sargent (1976). Examples of the literature using descriptive
time series methods to investigate the role of money shocks, investment shifts,
or other aggregate factors are Gordon and Veitch (1984), Lawrence and Siow
(1985), Litterman and Weiss (1984) and Sims (1972, 1980).

2The recent paper by Blanchard and Watson (1984) is one of a number of stu—
dies which suggest that aggregate shocks arise from a number of sources.
3See for example Lilien (1982a, l982b) for evidence in favor of the
hypothesis and Abraham and Katz (1985) for evidence against it.
4See Zarnowitz (1985, pp. 551—562) for a recent survey of this literature.
51n a companion paper (Altonji and Ham (1985)), we present a structural
market clearing model which generates the econometric specification used below.

We also investigate how relaxing the market clearing assumption along the lines
of Fischer (1977) and Phelps and Taylor (1977) affects our specification.

6Changes in provincial governments may affect investor confidence and capital formation in a region, and this will have an effect ott the demand for

labor. Of course, regional shocks also may arise from non—governmental sources.

For example, in industries such as agriculture, changes in weather conditions
will represent a region specific shock.
7See Burbidge and Harrison (1985) for a careful analysis of the rela—

tionship between aggregate Canadian and U.S. economic variables. They find
that the U.S. variables have a significant effect on the Canadian variables

—39--

(in a causality sense) but find that the Canadian variables have no economically
significant effect on the U.S. variables.

the estimation, w is allowed to vary over time. It is calculated

as (SHARE

pit—i

where SHARE

pit

is the share of total Canadian

employment in p1 in year t
9One could relax the specification (6) in a restricted way by making use
of data from an input—output table to provide a priori information on the

industry weights. (The necessary data appears to be available. See Whalley
(1983).) In the same spirit, one might make use of information from an input—
output table cross—classified by province to capture the most important dif-

ferences across provinces in feedback among province—industry pairs. This would
parallel the approach taken in some large scale multiregion econometric models
for the U.S., (see the Bolton (1980) survey), and would be an interesting topic

for future research. Long and Plosser (1983) present a model of output by
industry in which the input—output matrix across industries plays a key role in

the determination of the

II

matrix in (1).

10For the reason discussed in Section 5.1, we present estimates based on a

sample with Newfoundland excluded. This exclusion has no important effect on
our conclusions, and results for the case where data on Newfoundland are contained in the Appendix tables.
11

In Tables 4a and 4b, we present standard errors based on the standard OLS

and TSLS expressions. In principle, these standard errors should be corrected
for any remaining autocorrelation (which we find to be small) and for the

covariance structure of the errors described in Figure 1. Given our emphasis on
the variance decomposition presented below, we have not made these corrections.

—40—

It is worth noting that it may also be possible to improve efficiency by
adapting the two—step two stage least squares procedures discussed in Hansen

(1982) and Cumby etal (1983) to the present problem, although we leave this to
future research.

'2See, for example, Aigner etal. (1984) and Chamberlain (1984) for
discussions of these models and references to the literature.

'3An alternative strategy for estimating the response coefficients to the

national shock would involve using the average of the residuals across all pi

as an estimate c of c and estimating the f.

as an error term. Unfortunately, the estimate
pit

of c is contaminated by the presence of the industry, province, and
province—industry shocks and is correlated with composite error. Consequently,

c might pick up the effects of these shocks. A similar problem (and some
additional ones) arises with the use of Y

or the change in Canadian GNP as

ct

a proxy for c .

Although one may reduce these problems through various

instrumental variables schemes, we prefer to treat

ct as an unobservable and

use the minimum distance estimator.

for example, Magnus and Neudecker (1984)), and we use our

parameter estimates and the expressions in Figure 1 to calculate the covarian—

ces on the right—hand side of this equation. Alternatively, one could use the

elements of S to calculate these covariances, and we did this for three

—41—

cases. In the case of OLS residuals, data on Newfoundland excluded, using the

elements of S lead to a moderate reduction in the standard errors.

In the

case of OLS and TSLS residuals including Newfoundland, this had no effect on

the estimate standard errors. We should note that we have not made an adjustment to (21) when TSLS residuals are analyzed (see Newey (l985b).

Under the normality assmiption, the results of Magnus and Neudecker (1984) can

16Even with an optimal minimum distance estimator, it is unclear how one

would calculate the degrees of freedom for the test, since the sample moment

matrix is of dimension P1, but is only of rank T .

Thus, one could obtain a

perfect fit of this matrix by parameterizing the Tx P1 residuals used to
calculate the moment matrix.
17

It should be mentioned that the data are available on a monthly basis.

We have chosen to work with annual data for two reasons. First, employment in
Canada is highly seasonal. Treatment of seasonality in a satisfactory way
would greated complicate the econometric analysis. Second, with a quarterly or
monthly model it would probably be necessary to add additional employment lags
to the employment equation (6), and allow the composite error

to depend

upon lagged values of national, provincial, industry and province—industry

shocks. This would add greatly to the number of parameters to be estimated.
Since our model is already very large and costly to estimate, we leave an

analysis

using quarterly data to future research.

—42—

118The government figures appear low because government employment is spread

over other categories, including services, construction, and manufacturing. See
Ashenfelter and Card (1985) for a recent comparison of the US and Canadian labor

markets. Employment data for US are also available by industry and state from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. An analysis for the US along the lines of the
present paper would be an interesting topic for future research.
19'rhis large variance may reflect the fact that data on fishing are una-

vailable and thus we cannot include this industry in our analysis.

noted in footnote 10, results including Newfoundland are reported in

the Appendix tables. They are qualitatively similar to those excluding
Newfoundland.
21

Estimation of the basic model required significant expenditure of computer

funds. Since the results were quite similar across estimation methods and
samples, and to keep the computer budget from growing even larger, we did not
investigate each nodification for each of the four possible specifications:

TSLS including Newfoundland; OLS includingNewfoundland; TSLS excluding
Newfoundland; and OLS excluding Newfoundland. The addition of the own lag and
the provincial trend were considered only for TSLS and OLS including
Newfoundland.
22

Each of the average sample covariances in Table 6 is based on the average

of 30 sample covariances across different provinces for the same pair of

industries. The correlation coefficient between the (non—diagonal) average
sample covariances and predictions from the factor model reported in Table 6 is

.96. (The diagonal elements are excluded in this calculation since the factor
model estimate of each diagonal element is equal to the average sample

—43—

covariance.) The correlation coefficient between the individual sample moments
and the predicted moments (for different provinces) is .50. One would expect
this correlation coefficient to be lower than the first because of sampling

errors in the individual sample moments. These sampling errors in the individual moments tend to cancel out when one takes the average of covariances
across different provinces for a given industry pair.
23

Case i)

was investigate for the OLS and TSLS residuals when data on

Newfoundland are inchided. Case ii) was investigated for the TSLS residuals
including Newfoundland. The constrained estimation (for the negative variances)
was carried out on the TSLS residuals excluding Newfoundland.

241n taking this average, we have set the negative variances to 0.
25The Appendix tables contain the variance decompositions for TSLS and OLS

including Newfoundland and TSLS excluding Newfoundland. The lagged dependent
variable and autocorrelated error components cases (not reported) were analyzed

for the OLS and TSLS residuals including Newfoundland. As noted above, the
error components model was re—estimated with negative variances set to zero for
the TSLS residuals excluding Newfoundland.
