Overcoming the Fear of Free Falling: Monetary Policy Graduation in Emerging Markets
Carlos A. Vegh and Guillermo Vuletin
NBER Working Paper No. 18175
June 2012
JEL No. E52,F41
ABSTRACT
Developing countries have typically pursued procyclical macroeconomic policies, which tend to amplify
the underlying business cycle (the “when-it-rains-it-pours” phenomenon). There is, however, evidence
to suggest that about a third of developing countries have shifted from procyclical to countercyclical
fiscal policy over the last decade. We show that the same is true of monetary policy: around 35 percent
of developing countries have become countercyclical over the last decade. We provide evidence that
links procyclical monetary policy in developing countries to what we refer as the “fear of free falling;”
that is, the need to raise interest rates in bad times to defend the domestic currency.

Introduction
As is well-documented by now, developing countries have traditionally pursued procyclical
fiscal policy.2 In other words, governments have tended to follow expansionary fiscal policy
during booms and contractionary fiscal policy in recessions, thus exacerbating the underlying
business cycle (the so-called “when it rains, it pours” phenomenon).

Figure 1 illustrates procyclical fiscal policy on the spending side, by plotting the cyclical
components of government spending and real GDP for 94 countries during the period 1960 to
2009.3 Black bars denote industrial countries while light bars indicate developing countries. The
visual impression is quite striking: while an overwhelming majority of light bars lie on the right
side of the picture, indicating a positive correlation or procyclical government spending in
developing countries, a majority of black bars lie on the left side, indicating a negative
correlation or countercyclical government spending in industrial countries.4 Explanations for this
puzzling behavior of fiscal policy in developing countries range from imperfect access to
international capital markets (Gavin and Perotti, 1997; Riascos and Vegh, 2003) to political
pressures for additional spending in good times (Talvi and Vegh, 2005; Alesina and Tabellini,
1990; Iltezki 2011).

Over the last decade, however, many emerging countries have managed to escape the fiscal
procyclicality trap and actually become countercyclical (see Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletin, 2011).
To illustrate this “graduation” phenomenon, Figure 2 repeats Figure 1 for the period 1960-1999,
2

See Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) and the references therein.
Real government expenditure is defined as central government expenditure and net lending deflated by the GDP
deflator.

The same is true on the taxation side. As shown in Vegh and Vuletin (2012), tax rate policy tends to be procyclical
in developing countries and acyclical in industrial countries.

while Figure 3 focuses on the decade 2000-2009. While Figure 2 essentially conveys the same
message as Figure 1, Figure 3 shows an obvious shift of light bars from the right side of the
picture to the left. In fact, about a third of developing countries have graduated. Frankel, Vegh,
and Vuletin (2011) trace this dramatic shift in policy to improvements in institutional quality,
which are reflected in better fiscal institutions and policy rules that require the fiscal authority to
meet a certain target for the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (Frankel 2011). This ensures
that countries will save in good times and hence be able to dissave in bad times.

While a great deal of attention has been paid to the cyclical properties of fiscal policy, relatively
little attention has been devoted to monetary policy. In particular, there has been no attempt, as
far as we know, to examine whether the graduation phenomenon alluded to above is also present
for monetary policy. Our aim in this paper is thus to (i) document the extent of monetary policy
procyclicality in developing countries relative to industrial countries and (ii) assess how many
countries have graduated, if any, over the last decade. In fact, we will show that 40 percent of
developing countries in our sample have, on average, pursued procyclical monetary policy over
the last 50 years. In sharp contrast, every single industrial country has followed countercyclical
monetary policy over the same period. Over the last decade, however, around 35 percent of
developing countries have graduated.

We trace this graduation from monetary policy procyclicality to the fact that many emerging
markets have overcome what we call the “fear of free falling.” In the past – and this is still true,
of course, of many developing countries – the depreciation of the domestic currency during bad
times (typically characterized by large capital outflows) would force policymakers to raise

3

interest rates to defend the currency. The fear was (is) that a rapidly depreciating currency would
plunge the economy into a deeper crisis by encouraging further capital outflows and leading to
widespread bankruptcy of firms indebted in dollar terms. The need to raise interest rates to
defend the currency would preclude the possibility of using monetary policy to spur the
economy, as in industrial countries. As many emerging markets have matured – by undertaking
market-friendly reforms and pursuing sounder macroeconomic management – this fear of free
falling has subsided, or disappear altogether, thus allowing policymakers to free policy rates for
countercyclical purposes.

The paper proceeds as follows. We first document the shift in the cyclical behavior of monetary
policy over the last decade in the developing world. We then show empirically how this
graduation process is tightly linked to developing countries overcoming the fear of free falling.
Final thoughts close the paper.

Graduating class
This section documents the shift in the cyclical behavior of monetary policy over the last
decade in the developing world.

To set the stage, Figure 4 plots the cyclical component of

short-term interest rates and real GDP for 68 countries for the period 1960-2009.5 As can be
seen, every single dark bar lies on the left side of the figure, indicating that all industrial
countries have pursued, on average, countercyclical monetary policy (i.e., higher interest rates in
good times). In contrast, 40 percent of light bars (developing countries) lie on the right side,
5

We take short-term interest rates as a proxy for the stance of monetary policy. In some cases, we have data for
overnight interbank interest rates, such as the Federal Funds rate in the United States. In most cases, however, we
rely on discount rates due to their longer availability. Conceptually, any standard open economy model with
imperfect asset substitution would allow monetary authorities to use the interest rate as a policy instrument (see, for
instance, Calvo and Vegh, 1995, and Flood and Jeanne, 2005)

4

indicating procyclical monetary policy (i.e., lower interest rates in good times). In fact, the
average correlation for developing countries is 0.05 percent, compared to 0.41 for industrial
countries.

How is monetary policy cyclicality related to fiscal policy cyclicality? Not surprisingly, Figure 5
shows that fiscal and monetary policy cyclicality are strongly related. All countries pursuing
procyclical monetary policy (i.e., Corr(cycle i, cycle RGDP) < 0) have also followed procyclical
fiscal policy (i.e., Corr(cycle RG, cycle RGDP) > 0). Moreover, countries that tend to be more
countercyclical in monetary policy are also less procyclical when it comes to fiscal policy. Given
the close relation between the cyclicality of monetary and fiscal policy – and based on the
findings in Frankel, Vegh, Vuletin (2011) regarding fiscal policy graduation – we would expect
many developing countries to have also graduated from monetary policy procyclicality.

To address the issue of monetary policy graduation, we divide the 1960-2009 sample used in
Figure 4 into two sub-samples: 1960-1999 and 2000-2009. Figure 6 replicates Figure 4 for the
period 1960-1999 and conveys essentially the same message. Figure 7, on the other hand,
focuses on the period 2000-2009. Once again, the visual image conveyed by Figure 7 is striking
when compared to Figure 6. Specifically, the number of light bars on the left-side of the picture
(i.e., positive correlations) has greatly increased. Around 77 percent of developing countries (36
out of 47) now show countercyclical monetary policy, up from 49 percent (23 out of 47) in
Figure 6. Moreover, the average correlation between the cyclical components of short-term
interest rates and real GDP in developing countries has increased from -0.02 for the period 1960-

5

1999 (indicating acyclical monetary policy on average) to 0.28 since the year 2000 (indicating
countercyclical monetary policy).

To illustrate the issue of monetary graduation more broadly, Figure 8 presents a scatter plot with
the 1960-1999 correlation on the horizontal axis and the 2000-2009 correlation on the vertical
axis. By dividing the scatter plot into four quadrants along the zero axes, we can classify
countries into four categories:
1. Established graduates (top-right): These are countries that have always been countercyclical.
Not surprisingly, all industrial countries belong to this category. About 38 percent of developing
countries (18 out of 47) also fall into this category, including Colombia and Korea.
2. Still in school (bottom-left): These are countries that have continued to behave procyclically
over the last decade. These are all, of course, developing countries, including Costa Rica,
Gambia, and Uruguay. Interestingly, this category represents a fairly small set of all developing
countries (about 13 percent, or 6 out of 47).
3. Back to school (bottom-right): These are countries that were countercyclical during the 19601999 period and turned procyclical over the last decade. This small group of countries includes
Brazil, China, and Morocco. It is worth noting that, taken together, the “back to school” and
“still in school” categories represent less than 25 percent of all developing countries (11 out of
47).
4. Recent graduates (top-left): These are countries that used to be procyclical and became
countercyclical over the last decade. They are all developing countries (18 out of 47) and include
Chile and Mexico.)

6

In sum, the evidence suggests that more than a third of the developing world (18 out of 47
countries) has recently "graduated" from monetary policy procyclicality. As a result, about 77
percent (36 out of 47) of developing countries have followed countercyclical monetary policy
over the last decade.

Graduation and "fear of free falling."
What explains the ability of some developing countries to escape the procyclical monetary policy
trap? While there is no doubt that many factors come into play, we believe that a critical channel
is the following. In emerging economies, recessions are often associated with capital outflows
(and, in fact, are sometimes caused by sudden reversals of capital inflows, the so-called “sudden
stops” phenomenon; see Calvo, 1998). This capital outflow triggers a steep depreciation of the
domestic currency, which forces the Central Bank to raise interest rates to defend the currency.6
We refer to this monetary policy reaction as "fear of free falling" (FFF) and we measure it by
computing the correlation between the cyclical component of the short-term interest rate and the
rate of depreciation of the exchange rate.7 Specifically, a positive correlation indicates that the
short-term policy rate increases when the domestic currency is depreciating, indicating the

6

The need to defend the domestic currency in bad times is best exemplified by IMF advice during the 1997 Asian
crisis. To quote Stanley Fischer (at the time, the First Deputy Managing Director), “[i]n weighing [the question of
whether programs were too tough], it is important to recall that when they approached the IMF, the reserves of
Thailand and Korea were perilously low, and the Indonesian rupiah was excessively depreciated. Thus, the first
order of business was, and still is, to restore confidence in the currency. To achieve this, countries have to make it
more attractive to hold domestic currency, which, in turn, requires increasing interest rates temporarily, even if
higher interest costs complicate the situation of weak banks and corporations. This is a key lesson of the tequila
crisis in Latin America 1994-95, as well as from the more recent experience of Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hong
Kong and Russia, all of which have fended off attacks on their currencies in recent months with a timely and
forceful tightening of interest rates along with other supporting policy measures. Once confidence is restored,
interest rates can return to more normal levels.”

We borrow the expression “free falling,” of course, from Reinhart and Rogoff ‘s (2004) well-known exchange rate
regime classification.

presence of FFF.8 On the contrary, a zero correlation (or no FFF) suggests that the monetary
authority does not systematically respond to exchange rate movements. While a standard Taylor
rule would call for a lower interest rate during recessions, the presence of FFF forces
policymakers to raise interest rates to defend the currency.9

Indeed, Figure 9 shows that

monetary policy is procyclical for high levels of FFF and becomes more countercyclical as FFF
diminishes.

As we might expect, FFF is closely related to other common criteria used to ascertain the
soundness of government policy, such as institutional quality. We construct an index of
institutional quality (IQ) by calculating the average of four normalized variables from the
International Country Risk Guide dataset:
•

Investment profile: Factors affecting investment risk that are not covered by other
political, economic, and financial risk components. The risk rating assigned is the sum of
three subcomponents: contract viability/expropriation, profits repatriation, and payment
delays.

•

Corruption: Measures corruption within the political system.

•

Law and order: Assesses the strength and impartiality of the legal system and the popular
observance of the law.

•

Bureaucratic quality: Assesses the ability and expertise to govern without drastic changes
in policy or interruptions in government services.

8

Of course, if interest parity held in practice, our measure of FFF would be meaningless because it would always be
positive by construction (assuming variations in international interest rates are not significant). But, empirically, it
is well-known that interest parity does not hold, particularly in the short run (see, among others, Mishkin, 1984;
Frankel, 1991; Chinn and Guy Meredith, 2004; Akram, Rime and Sarno, 2008; and Burnside, Eichenbaum,
Kleshchelski, and Rebelo, 2010). In addition, for more than 90 percent of the countries, we use the discount rate,
rather than a short-term or market interest rate.
9
See Hnatkovska, Lahiri, and Vegh (2008) for a formal model of interest rate defense of the domestic currency in
small open economies.

8

The IQ index ranges from 0 (lowest institutional quality) to 1 (highest institutional quality).
Figure 10 shows that higher (lower) IQ is associated with lower (higher) FFF. Moreover, Figure
11 shows that in developing countries FFF diminishes over time as countercyclicality of
monetary policies increases.

Although it is tempting to think of capital flight and FFF as chronic scourges in developing
countries, they can change over time. Figure 12 provides some examples of the within-country
relation between FFF and cyclicality of monetary policy by plotting, for three different countries,
the 20 or 15 year rolling window associated correlations. Panel A shows the case of the United
Kingdom, an "established graduate". FFF levels have been consistently around zero and
monetary policy has always been countercyclical. At the other extreme, Panel B shows the case
of Uruguay, a "still in school" country. FFF levels have ranged between 0.4 and 0.9 and
monetary policy has been consistently procyclical. Panel C shows the case of Chile, a "recent
graduate". Remarkably, the FFF decreased from values close to 0.9 in the early 1980s to about
zero in the late 2000s. In line with our arguments, monetary policy shifted from being strongly
procyclical - with values close to Uruguay's - to countercyclical.

Graduation and "fear of free falling." Regression analysis
This section uses panel data regressions to exploit the within-country variability as opposed to
the cross section analysis underlying Figure 9. First, we estimate expanded Taylor rules for
developing countries (Corbo, 2000; Moron and Winkelried, 2005):
iitc = α + β ⋅ y itc + δ ⋅ π itc + λ ⋅ eitc + ηi + µit ,

(1)

9

where iitc , y itc , π itc , and eitc are the cyclical components of the short-term interest rate, real GDP,
inflation, and exchange rate depreciation, respectively. In addition, we will interact FFF with the
output cycle to evaluate whether the FFF alters the way in which monetary policy responds to
business cycle fluctuations.10 Specifically, we estimate:
iitc = α + β ⋅ yitc + δ ⋅ π itc + λ ⋅ eitc + γ ⋅ (FFFit × yitc ) + φ ⋅ FFFit + ηi + µit .

(2)

In line with our findings from Figure 9, we expect γ to be negative. This would confirm that
interest rates respond more countercyclicaly as FFF diminishes.
Table 1 shows all panel country-fixed-effects regressions. Columns 1, 2, and 3 estimate the
effect of each regressor in regression (1) one-at-a-time. Panel A shows the results for all
countries in the sample, which support Taylor rules implications. In particular, Column 1 shows
that, during good (bad) times interest rate increases (decreases), indicating that monetary policy
is countercyclical. Columns 2 and 3 support the notion that the interest rate is positively related
to inflation and depreciation shocks.

In line with our earlier correlation-based analysis, monetary policy is countercyclical in
industrial economies (Panel B, column 1) and seems to be acyclical in developing countries
(Panel C, column 1). These results continue to hold when we include macroeconomic
determinants of interest rate policy two-at-a-time or all together (Columns 4 to 7).

10

FFF is constructed using the 10-year rolling window correlation between the cyclical component of the short-term
interest rate and the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate.

10

Columns 8 to 10 estimate different versions of regression (2); column 8 excludes eitc , column 9
leaves π itc off, and column 10 includes all regressors. In all cases, the interaction term γ has a
negative sign, as expected. However, it is not statistically significant for industrial countries;
supporting the idea that FFF is not an important issue in those cases. In sharp contrast, FFF
appears to be critical for developing countries. First, the interaction term between FFF and real
GDP cycle is negative, which gives empirical support to the arguments laid out in the previous
section. Second, including FFF makes it possible to recover the Taylor rule prediction between
monetary policy and business cycle. Indeed, as shown in Panel C, columns 8, 9, and 10, once
FFF is included, the coefficient on RGDP cycle becomes positive.

We thus conclude from the empirical analysis that, when FFF is not an issue, monetary policy is
countercyclical because the traditional monetary policy reaction dominates. However, as FFF
increases, policymakers’ concerns regarding sharp depreciations during recessions become more
relevant. Eventually, for high levels of FFF, this new suggested channel dominates the traditional
one and monetary policy becomes procyclical.

Conclusions
We have documented the fact that, over the last decade, more than a third of developing
countries have graduated from monetary policy procyclicality and become countercyclical. We
have argued that a critical factor in achieving this important policy shift has been overcoming the
fear of free falling; that is, the need to defend a rapidly depreciating currency in bad times. This
frees the policy rate for countercyclical purposes.
