ABSTRACT
We mailed letters to non-existent business addresses in 159 countries (10 per country), and measured
whether they come back to the return address in the US and how long it takes. About 60% of the letters
were returned, taking over 6 months, on average. The results provide new objective indicators of government
efficiency across countries, based on a simple and universal service, and allow us to shed light on its
determinants. The evidence suggests that both technology and management quality influence the quality
of government.

I. Introduction
Most developing countries have poorly performing governments, as evidenced by surveys of
citizens, businessmen, foreign investors, or local experts (La Porta et al. 1999, Treisman 2000,
Svensson 2005, Kaufmann et al. 2008). Yet the quality of government improves as countries grow
richer (e.g., Barro 2012). The question is why? Unfortunately, survey responses make it difficult to
disentangle the determinants of the quality of government, since they capture the respondents’
combined assessment of government policies, corruption, and productivity. In addition, survey
responses often reflect a mixture of personal experiences and policy views (Glaeser et al. 2004).
In the standard explanation, governments in poor countries are run less well because they
are less accountable: citizens have few opportunities to exercise their voice through voting
(Hirschman 1970).

As countries become richer and more educated, politics becomes more

democratic and transparent, with the result that government responsiveness to citizen needs and
hence its quality improves (Verba and Nie 1972, Barro 1999, Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer 2007,
Papaioannou and Siourounis 2008, Djankov et al. 2010). One difficulty with such a voice-based
explanation is that the quality of government improves with development in dictatorships as well as
in democracies (Botero et al. 2012). Voice and accountability cannot be the whole story.
An alternative view of bad government in developing countries holds that productivity of
public services is low for similar reasons as that of firms. After all, public institutions are in effect
organizations, such as courts, police, or the post office, and as such their productivity might be
shaped by the same factors as that of firms. One reason for low productivity is inferior inputs,
including human and physical capital, and technology.

Another reason is poor management.

Management in the public sector might be poor for reasons unique to government, such as use of
patronage in hiring and promotion or low public sector wages that fail to attract talent. Evans and
Rauch (1999) and Rauch and Evans (2000) pioneered economic research on “Weberian
bureaucracies” that professionalize public sector management through meritocratic recruitment,
2

career ladders, and compensation.

Public sector management might also be poor for the same

reasons as that in the private sector, such as lack of incentives, supervision, and monitoring (Bloom
et al. 2007, 2010a,b, 2012a,b; Lewis 2004). Low government productivity shows up in many
outcomes, such as public worker absenteeism (Chaudhury et al. 2006), corruption and bureaucratic
delays (Treisman 2000, Svensson 2005), or low quality of public goods (La Porta et al. 1999).
We propose a new objective indicator of government efficiency, and use it to understand
the determinants of the quality of government. Our indicator describes the performance of the mail
system in accomplishing one simple task: returning an incorrectly addressed international letter.
Focusing on mail follows the suggestion by Edward Prescott in the early 1980s that postal economics
is more central to understanding the economy than monetary economics2.
Between December 2010 and February 2011 we sent letters to non-existent business
addresses in 159 countries: 2 letters in each country’s largest 5 cities. Each envelope had a typed up
address using the Latin alphabet, as required by international postal conventions, and included a
return address at the Tuck School of Business in Hanover, New Hampshire, as well as a clear request
to “please return to sender if undeliverable.” The addresses included an existent city and zip code
(where available), but a non-existent business name and street address. The letter inside was a
standard one page business letter, written in English and requesting a response from the recipient.
We included nothing else in the letter to avoid a temptation to open and steal the content (see
Castillo et al. 2011).
All countries subscribe to an international postal convention requiring them to return the
letters posted to an incorrect address. We measured the fraction of letters that were actually
returned, and how long it took the letters to come back from the date they were posted from
Cambridge, MA. We stopped keeping track of returns one year after the final postings that took
place on Feb 4, 2011. We do not believe this procedure aroused any concerns or delays at the US

post offices. We use the data to construct the share of letters we got back and how long it took to
get them back in each of 159 countries. We then analyze a variety of correlates of these measures
of postal efficiency.
Our approach to measuring government efficiency has two key advantages. First, we are
looking at a fairly simple and universal government service. All countries have post office equipment
reading zip codes and sometimes addresses, so the letter has to end up in the hands of a postal
employee whose job is to initiate the process of returning the letter but who can instead throw it
out. We measure productivity directly by whether this task is actually performed, and how fast.
Second, by design we are looking at a government service where corruption plays no role. It
is actually impossible to ask the American sender of the letter for a bribe, since he is not available to
pay it. Furthermore, no larger political purpose is served by either returning the letter or throwing it
out. In essence, we are examining a measure of the quality of government relatively free from
political influences. Political factors would influence outcomes through employment practices if
patronage and favoritism in the postal service shape employment practices. We address this
possibility in our empirical work.
Once we construct our measures, we consider some determinants of government efficiency.
We use measures of capital, labor, and technology in the postal system. Having accounted for those,
we turn to management. The principal hypothesis we consider is that postal efficiency is greater in
countries with “Weberian bureaucracies” (hereafter WB) as defined by Evans and Rauch (1999).
According to Weber (1968), professional bureaucracies are needed to accomplish social goals. Evans
and Rauch developed WB indices based on expert surveys for 35 countries, covering such aspects as
skill and merit based as opposed to patronage-based hiring, career employment, civil service
protection, and relative pay. Dahlstrom, Lapuente, and Teorell (2011) have recently updated and
refined these measures for over 100 countries in our sample, so we can examine the influence of WB
on postal efficiency, holding resources and technology constant.
4

We supplement WB indices with three other approaches to measuring public sector
management. First, one reason for poor public sector performance may be low relative wages,
which keep away talent and discourage initiative. Compensation is in fact part of WB indices. We
assemble additional data on relative public sector wages, including for 25 countries those of postal
employees, and consider their influence on postal efficiency. Second, Dahlstrom et al. (2011) also
collect data on objectives and attitudes of public sector employees. We examine the relationship
between these attitudes and postal efficiency. Finally, recent research shows that management
practices are a key determinant of productivity in the private sector (Bloom et al 2007, 2010a,b,
2012a,b).

We use survey measures of management quality in the private sector to examine its

impact on mail efficiency for a large sample of countries, but also more precise Bloom/Van Reenen
measures of management practices for a small sample. Our data enable us to check whether related
dimensions of public and private sector management influence postal productivity.
In brief, we find enormous variation across countries both in how many letters come back,
and how long it takes them to come back. Much of this variation is explained by the variation in
postal system resources and technology. Indices of Weberian bureaucracy, particularly meritocratic
recruitment, are also statistically significant determinants of postal productivity, while relative public
sector wages are not. Differences in private sector management quality help explain differences in
productivity across countries; interestingly, some of the same aspects of management in the public
and private sectors seem to matter. The evidence points toward better management as part of an
explanation of both private and public institutional improvement in the process of development.

II. Procedure and Variables.
We sent 2 letters to each of the 5 largest cities in 159 countries. These were airmail, first
class letters, with correct international postage of 98 cents. The letters were dropped in street mail

5

boxes in Cambridge, MA between December 8, 2010 and February 4, 2011. Both the letter inside
and the information on the envelope used the Latin alphabet and the Arabic numerals, as required
by the postal convention. The letter inside, reproduced in Figure 1, was always the same, and
written in English. It came from Rafael La Porta at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, New Hampshire. The letter stated that it was confidential, confirmed the receipt of
previous correspondence, and requested urgent response regarding the recipient’s willingness to
continue the collaboration project. The idea of such a letter was to add a bit of urgency to the task
of returning in the event that a postal employee opened the envelope and read it. At the same time,
we made sure there was only one piece of paper inside the envelope to minimize the temptation for
postal employees to look for valuables inside (Castillo et al. 2011).
The name of the addressee was chosen as a common name in the country. In addition to
the name of the addressee, each address on the front of the envelope had a generic name of a
business, such as Computer Management Professionals, Smart Computer Services, Inventory
Technology Partners, Professional Management Forum, Inventory Area Management Computer, etc.
Following the name of the business, the envelope had a printed address, which had a correct
existing zip code for the city in question but a non-existent address. Names of Nobel Laureates in
Economics and famous Western composers were used as street names. It is possible but extremely
unlikely that, by coincidence, the street address existed in that city at that zip code. For all practical
purposes, the street address was non-existent. The addresses were typed following the postal
convention. Figure 2 presents the front of the envelope for several of the returned letters.
In addition, each letter contained the return address of Rafael La Porta at the Tuck School of
Business at Dartmouth. Under the address, it said in larger bold letters PLEASE RETURN TO SENDER
IF UNDELIVERABLE. This too was done to encourage the return of the letter.
All of the countries in the sample subscribe to the Universal Postal Union. Article 147 from
the Universal Postal Union Letter Post Regulations Final Protocol of 2009 regulates the return of
6

incorrectly addressed mail, and in particular mandates the return of such mail under normal
circumstances (our letters certainly met those circumstances: they did not contain biodegradable or
radioactive material, etc.).

Moreover, the Regulations require that the letters must be returned

within a month of entering the country, and that the sending country (i.e., the US) pays for the
return.

The letters met all the requirements, such as how the addresses were typed, postage,

return addresses, letter weight, to trigger the return under the Universal Postal Union.
Following the mailing, we kept track of the dates of return of the letters, checking every
weekday when mail was delivered. Based on this information, we constructed three variables for
each country. The first is the fraction of the 10 letters that were returned. The second is the
fraction of 10 letters that were returned within 3 months, as would be (generously) required by
postal conventions. The third is the average time to get the letter back using the (equalizing)
assumption that the letters than never came back actually did come back on February 4, 2012, the
last day we kept track of the data. Appendix A provides a detailed description of all the variables we
use in the paper; Appendix B illustrates the construction of the mail variables for two extreme
countries: Czech Republic and Russia.
Table 1 presents some statistics on these three variables, and lists the countries with the
highest and the lowest share of returned letters. On average, we got 59% of the letters back (i.e., 6
out of 10 per country), although only 35% of the sent letters came back within 3 months. We got
100% of the letters back from 21 out of 159 countries, including from the usual suspects of efficient
government such as Canada, Norway, Germany, and Japan, but also from Uruguay, Barbados, and
Algeria. At the same time, we got 0% of the letters back from 16 countries, most of which are in
Africa but also including Tajikistan, Cambodia, and Russia. For high income countries, we got almost
85% of the letters back, and 60% within 3 months, while for low income countries these numbers fall
to 32% and 9%, respectively. Table 1 also shows that more of the letters came back, and they came
back quicker, from higher education than from lower education countries. Despite our focus on a

7

very simple task, government efficiency measures vary enormously across countries, and in ways
roughly related to per capita income and human capital, consistent with the evidence on subjective
indicators of the quality of government (La Porta et al 1999, Treisman 2000).
Table 2 correlate our measures of government efficiency with a large number of standard
measures, taken from standard data sources (for a sampling of these measures, see La Porta et al.
1999, although here we use the most recent numbers). These correlations are quite high. Insofar
as return of letters is not a corruption driven measure of government quality, this evidence suggests
that understanding mail efficiency may help gain broader insight into how government works3.
As a final point, we note that the coefficient of variation in our measures of postal
productivity is 1.80 for getting the letter back, and 1.11 for getting it back in 30 days (see Appendix
A). For comparison, the coefficient of variation for GDP per capita is .90. Despite the simplicity of
our measure, it is as variable across countries as the more traditional indicators of development.

III. Determinants of Mail Efficiency
Table 3 presents the determinants of mail efficiency, including resources of the postal
system, whether a country uses the Latin alphabet, as well as the extent of postcode databases. We
measure resources as the (ln) permanent offices per capita and (ln) postal staff per capita. The
correlation between these two variables is .82, so we use them separately.

We find that postal

resources are strong predictors of efficiency, as one would expect from a production function
specification. This result was confirmed using several other measures of postal resources, including
geographic area per office, number of sorting offices per capita, and number of full time staff per
capita (results not reported).

3

Nick Bloom has suggested that, since we send 2 letters to each city, we can use data about return of one as
an instrument for return of the other, to correct for the measurement error problem. We have done that, and
found that R-squared of regressions of our mail efficiency variables on the quality of government variables in
Table 2 in general increases (see Appendix C).

8

Table 3 also shows that countries that use the Latin alphabet return 12 percentage points
more letters (an extra .7 of a letter), and also return 11 percentage points more letters within three
months. Although using the Latin alphabet conforms to the postal convention that all countries sign,
language is an obstacle to the return of the letter from countries that do not use it.
We also find strong evidence that postcode databases predict our outcomes. The variable
equals 1 if postcode database includes street names, in which case the non-existence of the street
name, and therefore the incorrectness of the address, would pop out immediately as soon as the
envelope is machine read. The variable equals 0 if the postcode database only includes the names
of localities, in which case the envelope-reading machine would not detect the wrong address at all,
and a person is needed to do it. There are two intermediate values as well (see Appendix D for
precise description). We find that going from 0 to 1 on this variable raises by between 18 and 24
percentage points the number of letters that come back or that come back within 3 months. This
variable seems to capture technology differences among countries in the processing of letters.
Altogether, these resource and technology variables explain 41-47% of the variation across
countries in the share of letters that come back, and in the share of letters that come back within
three months. We do not have data on human capital of postal employees, although the standard
years of schooling variable is not significant when added to the specifications in Table 3. Although
over half the variance remains unexplained, this evidence shows that, even for this extremely simple
service, productivity differences are substantially accounted for by inputs, including technology4.
Before turning to management, we report some checks of robustness of the above findings.
We have considered a variety of alternative measures of postal resources, with similar results. We
have also verified that state monopoly on some postal activity does not affect our results. We have
examined several geographic and population controls related to mail specifically, such as distance to
the U.S., distribution area, population density of a country, a dummy for the country being
4

We have rerun the regressions in Table 3 using logistic and Tobin specifications. The results are very similar.

9

landlocked, and some measures of cost and fee adjustment based on geography that are produced
by the Universal Postal Union. Some of these measures are significant and add modest explanatory
power, but their inclusion does not alter our main results. We have considered many standard
measures of the quality of government, such as legal origins, latitude, trust, religion, ethnic
heterogeneity, and GDP per capita (La Porta et al. 1999). These variables do not alter our results.
We have also tried to take advantage of geographic diversity of our addresses within countries.
Generally speaking, letters come back faster and more consistently from capital cities, but otherwise
we did not find much. There is no evidence, in particular, that letters come back faster from richer
places within countries. All of these results are presented in Appendices E, F, and G.
The results so far suggest that measures of postal resources and technology explain 40-50%
of variation in mail efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that public and private productivity are
driven by similar economic factors. Yet much variance remains unexplained. To pursue this issue
further, we next turn to management as a potential source of differences in mail efficiency.

IV. Management.
In this section, we focus on management as a determinant of postal efficiency. The idea that
a professional bureaucracy with non-political rules of recruitment, promotion, and compensation of
employees delivers public goods better than a politicized bureaucracy goes back to Weber (19041911, 1968). Evans and Rauch (1999) measured such Weberian bureaucracy (WB) in 35 countries
using expert surveys. Conceptually, they distinguished in their questions three aspects of WB:
meritocratic recruitment, predictable career ladders, and compensation practices.

Dahlstrom,

Lapuente, and Teorell (DLT, 2011) significantly extended Evans and Rauch’s work by both revising
their variables and expanding the number of countries, while still collecting information from
country experts. Below we use DLT data.

10

DLT’s WB index consists of 9 components, divided into three categories: professional and
non-political administration, closed public administration, and salaries.

The first category covers

merit-based as opposed to political hiring. Experts answer four questions in this area: whether skills
and merit decide who gets the job when recruiting, whether political connections decide who gets
the job, whether political leadership hires and fires senior public sector officials, and whether senior
public sector officials are hired from the ranks of the public sector. The second category describes
whether public administration is closed, i.e., employs lifetime workers governed by special rules and
practices.

Finer (1997) distinguishes two approaches to organizing a bureaucracy: the open

bureaucracies with employees moving between public service and the private sector, adopted for
example in the UK, Netherlands, and Denmark, and closed/protected career bureaucracies of
France, Germany, and Spain. Experts answer three questions: whether public sector employees are
hired via a formal examination system, whether if recruited they stay in the public sector for the rest
of their careers, and whether terms and contracts in the public sector are regulated by special laws
not applying to the private sector.

The third category deals with salaries, and includes two

questions: whether senior officials have salaries comparable to those of similar private sector
managers, and whether salaries of public sector workers are linked to performance appraisals. In
DLT data, each expert answers each question on 1 (hardly ever) to 7 (almost always) scale, and DLT
average the answers across experts in each country. DLT also construct a WB index that averages
answers to the 9 questions (with higher values representing more “Weberianism”). The correlation
between their WB index and Evans and Rauch’s (1999) for the common 35 country sample is .67.
DLT supplement these questions on Weberian characteristics of the bureaucracy by a
number of questions about the attitudes and objectives of public employees, a topic also stressed by
Weber (1968). In particular, they ask whether public employees strive to: 1) be efficient, 2)
implement policies designed by top politicians, 3) help citizens, 4) follow rules, 5) fulfill the ideology
of parties in government. In addition, DLT construct an index of impartiality of public employees
focusing on whether kickbacks, bribes, discrimination, or personal connections influence their
11

decisions. They also separately ask whether public employees act impartially when implementing a
policy in a case. We use these assessments both to check whether a higher WB leads to more prosocial objectives and attitudes of public employees, and as alternative indicators of management
quality in the public sector.
As a first step in looking at these data, Table 4 presents cross-country correlations of
answers to the nine questions included in the WB index and assessments of public employee
attitudes.

The Table also correlates WB variables with two additional measures of public sector

wages: the ratio of average government wage to GDP per capita from the World Bank, and for 25
countries, the ratio of postman salary to GDP per capita, from the International Labor Organization.
In Table 4, Weberian indicators of professional and non-political public administration are
uniformly and consistently positively correlated with public-spirited objectives of government
employees (and negatively with the desire to fulfill the ideologies of parties in power). These
indicators are also uniformly and consistently positively correlated with indicators of public sector
impartiality. At the same time, there is no relationship between public sector professionalism and
measures of relative wages. Second, Weberian indicators of closedness of the bureaucracy are not
nearly as consistently correlated with public-spirited objectives. For attitudes and impartiality, 8 out
of 21 correlations are significant and of the “predicted” sign.

For wages, only the correlation

between lifetime public service employment and relative public sector wages is statistically
significant. Finally, there is also a fairly consistent positive correlation between salaries indicators
from DLT and public-spirited objectives of government employees, especially for salaries being
linked to performance. The correlations between DLT and public sector wages are weak. At least
from this initial look, Weberianism of the bureaucracy, especially professionalism, is indeed quite
strongly positively correlated with pro-social attitudes of the bureaucrats.
In the next three Tables, we consider WB indicators, bureaucratic salaries, and bureaucratic
attitudes as determinants of postal efficiency. Table 5 adds to the specifications in Table 3 the WB
12

indicators. We present the results solely for getting the letter back as the dependent variable; the
results for other variables are similar and are presented in Appendix H.

We use three Weberian

indicators: the WB index defined as the average answer to the 9 questions summarized in Table 4,
the average answer to the four questions on professional and non-political public administration
(professionalism sub-index), and the average answer to three questions about closed public
administrations (closedness sub-index). We deal with salaries separately in Table 6. In addition,
Table 5 uses as an independent variable “public management performance” from a different data
source. The results show that the WB is a statistically significant predictor of getting the letter back,
holding everything else constant. The effect comes from the professionalism sub-index, and not
from closedness (and as we show in Table 6 not from salaries). Of the 4 questions going into the
professionalism sub-index, skill-and-merit-based recruiting does all the work.

Raising

professionalism of bureaucracy by one standard deviation raises the probability of getting a letter
back by 5 percentage points, a big effect. Public management performance score has a significant
effect on the likelihood of getting the letter back as well. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that improvements in public sector management, expressed as professionalization of the
bureaucracy, improve postal efficiency.
Table 6 shows, in contrast, that neither the wage variables from DLT, nor the two wage
variables we added to the data set, help explain postal efficiency. The result that relative wages of
public officials are not important in predicting performance is consistent with earlier findings of La
Porta et al. (1999) and Evans and Rauch (1999). Table 7 turns to the attitudes of public sector
employees. The results are more mixed. Striving to help citizens, not following government party
ideology, and measures of impartiality are statistically significantly correlated with mail efficiency.
Other measures of attitudes, including public employees striving to be efficient, are not.
An alternative approach to measuring management quality is to consider private sector
management. Perhaps countries that manage the private sector better also manage the public

13

sector better. This approach also provides an independent check on our evidence for the Weberian
hypothesis. After all, the issue in returning the mail is how to get a low level postal employee to
actually do his job or putting the incorrectly addressed letter into a correct (return) container, rather
than throw it out or get rid of it in some other way. This seems to be fundamentally a management
task of monitoring employees (it is hard to see how incentives would work).
We consider two groups of management variables. First, we found three survey-based
cross-country measures of management quality: will to delegate authority, innovation capacity, and
quality of management schools.

Second, for 16 countries, we have the Bloom/Van Reenen

management practices index, as well as the three sub-indexes of monitoring management, targets
management, and incentives management.

Table 8 presents the correlations between nine

Weberian questions from DLT and the seven quality of private management indicators we found. A
bit remarkably, at least to us, measures of professionalism of public administration are consistently
positively correlated with the cross-country indicators of the quality of private sector management.
In addition, private sector management quality seems to be highly correlated with salaries of public
employees being linked to performance. On the other hand, there is no relationship between
closedness of public administration and private sector management quality.

These correlations

suggest that similar management practices shape efficiency in both public and private sectors.
Table 9 presents the results for private sector management and mail efficiency. The three
indicators of private sector management quality are all significant predictors of whether the letters
get back. Table 9 also shows a strong influence of Bloom/Van Reenen management practices index,
as well as of monitoring management and targets management sub-indices, on mail efficiency.
Consistent with the evidence in Table 8, the variables most intimately related to professional
management in both public and private sectors are important determinants of mail efficiency.
We stress that our results on management are cross-sectional, and as such cannot be
interpreted as causal. Omitted country characteristics could influence both management quality and
14

postal efficiency.

In a cross-section, we found it difficult to come up with a plausible instrument

satisfying the exclusion restriction. At the same time, our management variables are correlated with
mail efficiency in both democracies and autocracies, which suggests that the omitted variables are
unlikely to be political factors that are central to the standard view of government quality.
In summary, it appears that measures of management quality in the public and private
sectors, obtained from very different sources, explain some of the variation in postal productivity
across countries, just as it explains variation in private sector productivity. If not spurious, this
finding leaves open the deeper question of how countries solve these basic management problems,
such as getting a postal employee to get his job done, as they develop. One possibility suggested by
the results in Table 9 is that the more developed countries could hire better educated and trained
managers, who bring better practices into the public as well as the private sector, and in particular
can provide the necessary supervision of the employees (see Gennaioli et al. 2012). More broadly,
an important reason for low quality government in developing countries is low overall productivity.

IV. Conclusion.
This paper has made two contributions. First, we constructed new objective measures for
the quality of government in 159 countries, based on return of incorrectly addressed international
mail. These measures correlate with other indicators of the quality of government, yet have the
advantage that we know more precisely what goes into them.
Second, we used these measures to argue that one reason for poor government in
developing countries is the same low productivity that plagues the private sector in these countries
as well. Such low productivity is explained to a large extent by inputs and technology, but also by
management. In fact, our findings could shed light on some fundamental puzzles related to the
quality of government. The first puzzle, illustrated by this paper, but seen in other research as well

15

(e.g., La Porta et al 1999, Treisman 2000, Botero et al. 2012) is that the quality of government
improves as countries grow richer. This fact is surprising if one focuses on the uniqueness of
government, but makes more sense once it is recognizes that government is subject to the same
productivity dynamics as the private sector.
Second, the analysis suggests that even the more political aspects of poor government, such
as corruption, may be a reflection of problems similar to those of the private sector, such as
mismanagement. Corruption, for example, might be in part a manifestation of the weakness of
monitoring and incentive systems in less developed countries. Perhaps our small findings on the
post office could be developed into a broader theory of the quality of government and its evolution
in the course of economic development.

The type of postcode database used in each country in 2011. We elaborated this data using the information of the classification of postcode databases that countries have according to the
Universal Postal Union. The data is based on the classification made by the Universal Postal Union of the type of postcode databse that each country sends them. UPU creates a Universal
DataBase of raw postcodes containing all available information on the postal addressing data. This database contains the postcode data to town locality, street and delivery point level,
depending on the particular country's system. UPU classifies countries in four groups: (A) the database of teh counry contains postcodes for localities and streets, to which we assign a
value of 1; (B) the database containd postcodes for localities and districts, to which we assigned a value of 0.66; (C) the database contains postcodes for localities, to which we assigned a
value of 0.33; and (D) the database only contains names of localities only, to which we assigned the value of 0. (Source: Own calculation based on UPU data).

5.66

Index of "Weberian" qualities of the public administration. Each expert was asked to provide a quantitative answer in a scale from 1 (hardly ever) to 7 (almost always) to each question
included in the Quality of Government Survey. The questions included in the Weberian index are: (1) When recruiting public sector employees, the skills and merits of the applicants decide
who gets the job; (2) When recruiting public sector employees, the political connections of the applicants decide who gets thejob (we inverted the scale for this question); (3) The top
political leadership hires and fires senior public officials (we inverted the scale for this question); (4) Senior public officials are recruited from within the ranks of the public sector; (5) Public
sector employees are hired via a formal examination exam; (6) Once one is recruited as a public sector employee, one stays a public sector employee for the rest of one's career; (7) The
terms of employment for public sector employees are regulated by special laws that do not apply to private sector employees; (8) Senior officials have salaries that are comparable with the
salaries of private sector managers with roughly similar training and responsibilities; and (9) The salaries of public sector employees are linked to appraisals of their performance. To
construct the index for each country, we average the responses of all country experts to each question and then average the scores of the nine questions. We include all countries for which
at least 2 expert responses were obtained. (Source: Own calculation based on expert data from the Quality of Government Survey (2011) and Dahlstrom, Lapuente and Teorell (2011)).

the scale for this question); and (3) When granting licenses to start up private firms, public sector employees favor applicants which they have strong personal contacts? (we inverted the
scale for this question). The methodology is identical to one used in the construction of the Weberian public administration index described above. (Source: Own calculation based on expert
data from the Quality of Government Survey (2011) and Dahlstrom, Lapuente and Teorell (2011)).

This variable measures the impartiality of the public bureaucracy. It is built on comparable expert evaluations of employment-related bureaucratic structures. Each expert was asked to
provide a quantitative answer in a scale from 1 (hardly ever) to 7 (almost always) to the question: Generally speaking, how often would you say that public employees today act impartially
when deciding how to implement a policy in an individual case? The methodology is identical to one used in the construction of the Weberian public administration index described above.

Appendix C: Mail efficiency and other dimensions of government efficiency and institutional quality (OLS and Instrumental Variables)
(Instrumenting the average of the second letter sent to each of the 5 cities in each country with the average of the first letter sent to each of the 5 cities in each country)
This table shows the results of robust OLS and robust Instrumental Variables regressions using the full sample of countries with letters data. Each row shows regression results using each of our three mail efficiency variables on
the measure of government efficiency or quality of institutions shown in the first column. For each of the three mail efficiency variables, the first two columns show the results of robust OLS regressions. The first column shows
the coefficient and significance level for the mail variable used as regressor and the second column the R-squared of the specification. The third and fourth columns show the results of robust Instrumental Variables regressions. For
the Instrumental Variables regressions, each mail efficiency variables is calculated as the average of the second letter sent to each of the five different cities in each country, and is instrumented by the average of the first letter sent
to each of the five different cities in each country. For each of the three mail efficiency variables, the last column shows the number of observations used in the regressions. All OLS and IV regressions includes a constant, but the
coefficients of the constant is not shown.
