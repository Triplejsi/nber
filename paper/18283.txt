Over-optimistic Official Forecasts in the Eurozone and Fiscal Rules
Jeffrey A. Frankel and Jesse Schreger
NBER Working Paper No. 18283
August 2012
JEL No. F3
ABSTRACT
Why do countries find it so hard to get their budget deficits under control? Systematic patterns in
the errors that official budget agencies make in their forecasts may play an important role. Although
many observers have suggested that fiscal discipline can be restored via fiscal rules such as a legal
cap on the budget deficit, forecasting bias can defeat such rules. The members of the eurozone are
supposedly constrained by the fiscal caps of the Stability and Growth Pact. Yet ever since the birth
of the euro in 1999, members have postponed painful adjustment by making overly optimistic forecasts
of future growth and budget positions and arguing that the deficits will fall below the cap within a
year or two. The new fiscal compact among the euro countries is supposed to make budget rules more
binding by putting them into laws and constitutions at the national level. But what is the record with
such national rules?
Our econometric findings are summarized as follows:
• Governments’ budget forecasts are biased in the optimistic direction, especially among the Eurozone
countries, especially when they have large contemporaneous budget deficits, and especially during
booms.
• Governments’ real GDP forecasts are similarly over-optimistic during booms.
• Despite the well-known tendency of eurozone members to exceed the 3% cap on budget deficits,
often in consecutive years, they almost never forecast that they will violate the cap in the coming years.
This is the source of the extra bias among eurozone forecasts. If euro area governments are not in
violation of the 3% cap at the time forecasts are made, forecasts are no more biased than other countries.
• Although euro members without national budget balance rules have a larger over-optimism bias than
non-member countries, national fiscal rules help counteract the wishful thinking that seems to come
with euro membership. The reason is that when governments are in violation of the 3% cap the national
rules apparently constrain them from making such unrealistic forecasts.
• Similarly, the existence of an independent fiscal institution producing budget forecasts at the national
level reduces the over-optimism bias of forecasts made when the countries are in violation of the 3%
cap.

1. Introduction
Fiscal rules are increasingly proposed as a means of reining in excessive budget deficits.
By now it is clear to all that the Stability and Growth Pact has failed to keep budget deficits and
debt levels of eurozone members within the limits specified: originally 3 per cent of GDP and 60
per cent of GDP, respectively. In response to the euro crisis that began in 2010, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel has proposed and won acceptance for a new Fiscal Compact among
the euro states. The goal of the compact is to strengthen fiscal rules among euro members, in
particular by writing them into laws and constitutions at the national level.
In any effort to revise or strengthen fiscal rules, it would help to know why some rules
have failed in the past, such as the SGP itself, and what the record with national rules of various
sorts is: limits on spending vs. deficits, conditional or unconditional, with or without
independent fiscal agencies, and so forth.
One factor behind excessive budget deficits worldwide is a tendency for official forecasts
of growth rates, tax receipts, and budget balances to be overly optimistic.

It stands to reason

that a government that foresees, or claims to foresee, healthy surpluses in coming years is less
likely today to take the difficult steps that might be necessary to strengthen the budget, such as
cutting spending and raising tax rates.
The bias toward optimism in fiscal forecasts among the 24 countries included in this
study is .28% of GDP at the one year horizon, .93% of GDP at the two year horizon, and 1.90%
at the three-year horizon. For the 17 European countries, the bias is even higher, despite the rules
of the SGP (or perhaps because of them): .52% at the one year horizon, 1.29% at the two year

2

horizon and 2.4% at the three year horizon.1 An important component of the over-optimism in
official forecasts of the budget deficit is over-optimism in official forecasts of GDP.2

1.1 Literature Review
Fiscal rules
Many experts and some elected officials have suggested that annual deficits and longterm debt can best be held in check through fiscal policy rules or mechanisms such as deficit or
debt caps.3 Some countries have already enacted laws along these lines. The most important and
most well-known example is the fiscal rules of the euro zone, which supposedly limit budget
deficits to 3 per cent of GDP and debts to 60% of GDP. 4

(The Maastricht Treaty specified

these fiscal rules as criteria for determining what countries are admitted to the eurozone. The
Stability and Growth Pact supposedly dictated that member countries must continue to meet the
criteria.) Some euro countries have enacted budget rules at the national level.
Other countries have also adopted fiscal rules and other similar institutions.5 In a recent
IMF Working Paper, Schaechter, et. al. (2012) create a new database of national and
supranational fiscal rules across 81 countries from 1985 to 2012. The authors report that while
only five countries had fiscal rules in place in 1990, 76 countries had them in place by the end of
March 2012. The success of these measures, however, depends on making accurate forecasts of

weight, even if some countries have more observations.

government spending and revenues. Getting those forecasts right has proven to be difficult for
most governments.

Research on Official Fiscal Forecasting
Econometric studies have already shown that government budget forecasts in many countries
are overly optimistic on average, often because official estimates of economic growth are overly
optimistic.
Auerbach (1994) finds overly optimistic official U.S. forecasts in the decade up to 1993.
McNees (1995) finds an optimistic bias in official forecasts of long-term American growth
through 1994. Auerbach (1999) again finds a tendency for US Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) forecasts to overestimate revenues during the period 1986-93, but found a
tendency to underestimate revenues during the subsequent period, 1993-99.

McNab, Rider, and

Wall (2007) find that OMB’s one-year ahead forecasts of US tax receipts were biased over the
period 1963-2003 and suggest that the bias may have been strategic on the part of various
administrations seeking to achieve particular goals, such as overstating budget balance when the
administration is seeking to increase spending or cut taxes. Frendreis and Tatalovich (2000)
show that US administrations (OMB) are less accurate in estimating growth, inflation and
unemployment than is the independent Congressional Budget Office or the Federal Reserve
Board. They find partisan bias, interpreted as Republican administrations over-forecasting
inflation and Democratic administrations over-forecasting unemployment.
Forni and Momigliano (2004) find optimism bias among OECD countries in general. Ashiya
(2005, 2007) shows that official Japanese growth forecasts are biased upwards and are
significantly less accurate than private sector forecasts. According to O’Neill (2005) and
Mühleisen, et al, (2005), Canada underestimated its budget deficits in the late 1980s and early
4

1990s, but subsequently overestimated them (1994-2004), perhaps to reduce the risk of missing
its target of a balanced budget under its strengthened institutional framework.
Jonung and Larch (2006) find that budget agencies in the EU systematically overestimate the
economic growth rate. The tendency toward overly optimistic forecasts is especially strong in
Italy and Germany. The UK is an exception. Strauch, et al (2009) find a statistically significant
optimism bias for some euro members: Germany, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, and Portugal for
the period 1991-2004. The UK, Finland and Sweden, on the other hand, tend to overestimate
their deficits. In light of this difference, it is suggestive that the UK and Sweden were not trying
to get into the euro, which would have required meeting the fiscal criteria of the 1992 Maastricht
Treaty, while the others were trying to get in, and are now there and thus subject to the Stability
and Growth Pact (SGP).6

Brück and Stephan (2006) explicitly conclude that Eurozone

governments have manipulated deficit forecasts before elections since the introduction of the
SGP. Most of these authors argue that the systematic over-optimism in ex ante forecasts
translates directly into larger ex post deficits, and particularly to deficits larger than targeted
under the SGP.
Similarly, Beetsma et al (2009) find that realized budget balances among SGP countries on
average fall short of official ex ante plans. Marinheiro (2010) adds another complete business
cycle to the data under the SGP, and again finds that the forecasts of European fiscal authorities
are systematically too optimistic. This evidence is not consistently strong across the set of 15
EU countries, but the bias is high for France, Italy and Portugal at all forecast horizons.7
Beetsma et al (2011) decompose the overall optimism bias in the budget forecasts of EU
governments into the component that arises between initial plans and the first release of actual
6

Indeed, Sweden’s strategy for staying out could have been to feign fiscal imprudence!
He proposes delegating the macroeconomic forecasting to supranational authorities, such as the EU Commission or
the IMF.

budget numbers and the component that arises between the first release and the final revised
budget numbers.
One of the present authors (Frankel, 2011, 2112) recently studied forecasts of real growth
rates and budget balances made by official government agencies in 33 countries. A number of
striking findings emerge. (i) The official forecasts have an upward bias, which is stronger at
longer horizons. On average the gap between the forecast of the budget balance and the realized
balance is 0.2 percent of GDP at the one-year horizon, 0.8 percent at the two-year horizon, and
1.5 percent at the three-year horizon. (ii) One reason for the optimism bias in official budget
forecasts is an optimism bias in forecasts of economic growth. The country's growth rate is an
important determinant of the budget balance at all three time horizons, so over-optimism in
predicting growth is linked to over-optimism in predicting budget balances. On average, the
upward bias in growth forecasts is 0.4 percent when looking one year ahead, 1.1 percent at the
two-year horizon, and 1.8 percent at three years. (iii) The bias is stronger in booms than in
normal times. These findings can help to explain excessive budget deficits, and especially the
failure to run surpluses during periods of high output: if a boom is expected to last indefinitely,
then saving for a rainy day is unnecessary.
Many believe that better fiscal policy can be obtained by means of rules such as ceilings
for the deficit. But Frankel (2011) also finds: (iv) countries subject to a budget rule, in the form
of euroland’s Stability and Growth Path, make official forecasts of growth and budget deficits
that are even more biased and more correlated with booms than do other countries. This effect
may help explain frequent violations of the SGP.

2. Data on Official Budget Forecasts
The primary data for this paper come from an expanded version of the dataset used in
Frankel (2011). The dataset is composed of the official government forecasts in documents for
34 countries.8 Of these we have at least one full decade of budget data for 24 countries. The
countries with less than a decade of fiscal forecasting data are primarily Central and Eastern
European countries that only began publicly providing forecasts when they began submitting
Stability and Convergence Programs to the European Commission in 2005. These short time
series are almost entirely concentrated around the period of the global financial crisis, 20082012; we exclude them from the analysis to avoid results that might be driven solely by this
single unusual historical episode.
Of the remaining 24 countries, the 17 European countries9 are the main focus of our
analysis. The 7 non-European countries10 will be used occasionally, as a standard of
comparison. Beginning in 1999, the data for all European Union countries come from the
Stability and Convergence Programs that EU members are required to submit annually to the
European Commission as part of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Prior to that, forecasts
were taken directly from national budgets. The dataset contains not only forecasts of the overall
budget balance, but also forecasts of real GDP growth, revenues as a percentage of GDP,
expenditures as a percentage of GDP, and the inflation rate. In the Stability and Convergence
Programs, EU countries are required to provide forecasts at least three years ahead, but the
forecasting horizon is often shorter in other countries’ budget processes. For instance, Norway
only forecasts its budget balance one year ahead. More information on the official budget

forecast as well as the data on the realizations of these macroeconomic variables can be found in
the appendix.
The budget balance forecast data used in the analysis are summarized in Table A1 of the
appendix. In the table, it can be seen that budget forecast errors exhibit heterogeneous patterns
across countries. Figures 1 and 2 plot the mean one and two year horizon forecast error for each
of the countries in sample. The forecast error is defined as forecast budget balance minus actual
budget balance, so positive numbers indicate over-optimistic forecasts. In both cases, Greece,
Ireland and Portugal are the countries that have the most over-optimistic forecasts. Figure 3
plots the mean budget balance forecast error by year for European countries. The figure shows
that while budget forecast errors were particularly large in the wake of the global financial crisis
beginning in 2008, budget balances are generally over-optimistic throughout the full sample
period. Again, the over-optimism increases with the forecast horizon. Figure 4 plots the
equivalent figure for real GDP forecast errors for the European countries.

3. Influences on Official Forecasts
In order to understand the sources of budget forecast errors, it is useful to begin by
examining how forecasts are affected by macroeconomic variables available contemporaneously,
that is, at the time the forecasts are made. To study forecast bias we compare how macro
variables explain forecast budget balance improvements and actual changes in the budget
balance. 11 We define the i-year budget balance improvement (BBIt+i) as the change in the
budget balance (BB) between time t and t+i:

11

In this paper, we use the revised versions of macroeconomic statistics rather than the statistics that were
contemporaneously available because of data availability. For analysis of budget forecast errors using real-time data
see Beetsma et. al. (2009).

8

BBIt+i =BBt+i -BBt
The Forecast Budget Balance Improvement (FBBIt+i) is defined equivalently, with the forecast of
the year t+i budget balance replacing BBt+i.
Here, we limit ourselves to two explanatory variables: the current budget balance (BBt)
and the output gap (OGt). To calculate the output gap, log real GDP is HP filtered and the output
gap is defined as the cyclical component, that is, log GDP minus the trend component (times
100). Table 1 looks only at European countries. We regress Forecast and Actual Budget
Balance Improvements on the current output gap and budget balance:
BBIt+i =0+1 BBt +2OGt +t+i .
The main finding in these regressions is that governments forecast too much mean
reversion, with 1 strongly negative and significant for forecast improvements but much less so
for actual improvements. The magnitude of 1 increases with the forecast horizon.
In addition, an excess of current output above trend portends a deterioration in the budget
balance in the subsequent year (presumably due to reversion in output), which is not at all
captured in the forecast. We find that these two macroeconomic variables – the current budget
deficit and output -- explain a large fraction of forecast budget balance improvements: for
European countries the R2 is 0.41 at the one-year forecast horizon, 0.56 at the two-year forecast
horizon, and 0.66 at the three-year horizon. While official government forecasts predict that
deficits will be short-lived, the actual budget balance improvements have much lower 1
coefficients.
In Table 2, rather than including just the simple budget balance at the time the forecast
was made, BBt, we allow the coefficient on the contemporaneous budget balance to differ
depending on whether the budget is in surplus or deficit. Defining Surplust as an indicator

9

variable that takes the value of 1 when BBt is greater than or equal to 0, and Deficitt as an
indicator variable that takes the value 1 when BBt is less than 0, we run the regression:
BBIt+i =0+1 Surplust*BBt +2 Deficitt*BBt +3OGt +t+i .
The key finding is that at the one year horizon, the coefficient 2 on Deficitt*BBt is negative and
very strongly significant, but the coefficient 1 on Surplust*BBt is insignificantly different than
zero. In the short-term, we therefore see that countries forecast deficits to disappear but do not
do so for surpluses.
In column 2, we see that this prediction is qualitatively correct, as large deficits do
predict budget balance improvements but surpluses do not. However, the 2 coefficient for the
forecast improvement is nearly three times as large as for the actual improvements, meaning that
while deficits tend to be reduced in the short run, they are not reduced as much as they are
forecast to. Interestingly, at the two year horizon, surpluses and deficits are forecast to be nearly
equally mean-reverting, while at the three year horizon deficits are forecast to contract more
quickly than surpluses. Thus, while government forecasts claim that deficits will be quickly
eliminated, and this tendency explains a large amount of the variation in their forecasts, in reality
these measures are poor predictors of the evolution of the budget deficit.
In appendix Table A4, we run a version of the regressions in Table 1 on forecast and
actual real GDP growth levels. We find that while the output gap has very little explanatory
power for government real GDP growth forecasts, it actually has quite a bit of explanatory power
for actual GDP growth. The output gap at the time forecasts are prepared enters strongly
negatively. This result should be interpreted with some caution as our measure of the output gap
uses future information as it is calculated using the HP filter.

10

3.1 Forecast Errors
In this section, we focus explicitly on how current macroeconomic conditions relate to
future forecast errors. We define the i year ahead budget balance forecast errors BBEt+i as the
forecast budget balance value minus the actual budget balance.
BBEt+i =FBBt+i,t -BBt+i
In the above expression BBEt+i indicates the realized i year ahead forecast error, FBBt+i,t
is the budget balance forecast for period t+i made in period t, and BBt+i is the realized budget
balance in period t+i . Much of the remainder of this paper will focus on understanding when
countries are systematically over-optimistic in their official budget forecasts (a high value of
BBEt+i). We begin this exercise in the first three columns of Table 3 by seeing whether
macroeconomic variables known at the time the forecast is made (time t) can predict the size of
budget forecast errors.
BBEt+i =0+1 BBt +2OGt +t+i .
In columns 1-3 of Table 3 we see that large budget deficits at the time a forecast is made
on average correspond to forecasts that prove to be over-optimistic. This bias increases with the
forecast horizon. In addition, we find further support for the conclusion of Frankel (2011) that
official forecasts are especially subject to wishful thinking during booms, defined here as output
being above trend.12 For European countries, a 1% increase in the output gap at the time a
forecast is made is associated with a budget forecast that is 0.6% of GDP too optimistic at the
one year horizon, 1.4% at the two year horizon and 1.9% at the three year horizon.

12

Because the Output Gap is constructed using the HP filter, future data is used in constructing the contemporary
output gap so these are not true predictive regressions. However, these results are generally robust to replacing the
output gap with recent GDP growth.

11

In Table 4, we once again introduce dummy variables for surpluses and deficits to see if
surpluses and deficits differentially affect budget forecast errors:
BBEt+i =0+1 Surplust*BBt +2 Deficitt*BBt +3OGt +t+i .
We find that at all three horizons, 2 is negatively and strongly significant, confirming that
countries with larger budget deficits are more over-optimistic in their forecasts. At the two year
horizon, we again find that countries forecast that their surpluses will shrink more quickly than
they do.
Tables A5 and A6 (reported in the appendix) perform the same exercise for two different
subsamples: euro area countries and non euro countries. Larger current budget deficits are
associated with significantly more over-optimistic budget forecasts at all horizons over both the
1999-2007 and 1999-2011 time periods for euro area countries. So the crises of 2008-2011 are
not driving these results.13 The current output gap is a robust predictor of over-optimistic budget
forecasts for both euro area and non-euro area countries, over either period.
In Columns 4-6 of Table 3, we repeat this exercise for GDP growth forecast errors.
Defining the real GDP growth forecast error as:
GDPEt+i =FGDPRt+i,t -GDPRt+i ,
where FGDPRt+i,t is the time t forecast of real GDP growth rate in year t+i, and GDPRt+i is the
actual real GDP growth rate in period t+i, we regress GDPEt+i on the contemporaneous output
gap and budget balance to see if these current variables can explain the forecasting bias. As was
the case for budget deficits, a large positive output gap is a strong predictor of over-optimistic
forecasts; booms are unrealistically extrapolated into the future. A contemporary budget deficit is
a weaker predictor of over-optimism and is only significant at the two year horizon.
13

Larger budget deficits are only a predictor of over-optimism at the two year horizon from 1999-2011 for non-euro
area countries.

12

Governments predict that booms will continue longer than they actually do. Those countries
with budget deficits have a tendency to wish them away via future growth prospects.

4. Over-optimism and the Stability and Growth Pact
Next, we explore how exactly the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) rules relate to overoptimism in the euro area. Because the SGP forbids EU members to exceed a deficit of 3% of
GDP we hypothesize that governments will be reluctant to forecast breaches of this limit and will
instead shade their forecasts into the permissible range and then if necessary blame their
subsequent violation on events outside their control. While all signatories of the Maastricht
Treaty technically agree to abide by the SGP limits on deficits and debt, only euro area countries
face the threat of sanctions for violations (in theory) or political pressure and embarrassment (in
practice). We therefore treat euro area members as the only countries for whom the SGP limits
are relevant.
Figure 5 offers visual support for the idea that the SGP makes countries less willing to
forecast deficits greater than 3% of GDP but not necessarily less likely to violate the limit. In all
four panels, the vertical red line indicates a budget deficit of 3% of GDP. In the upper left hand
panel, we see that prior to the global financial crisis, only once did a euro area country forecast a
violation of the 3% limit at the two year horizon, yet there is no such discontinuity for actual
budget deficits (upper right hand panel). For comparison, we include a similar histogram of two
year forecasts for countries outside the euro area, and the corresponding realizations in the lower
right panel. In Table A7, in the appendix, we contrast forecast and actual violations of the 3%
deficit/GDP limit for Euro area and non Euro area countries from 1999-2007. At all forecast

13

horizons, euro area countries were less likely to forecast deficits over 3% even though they
actually violated the limit more frequently.
To examine more systematically this idea that countries bound by the Stability and
Growth Pact try to avoid or postpone reprimands by means of overly optimistic forecasts, in
Table 5 we begin by regressing budget forecast errors on the contemporaneous output gap OGt
and a dummy variable for membership in the euro area Eurot .14 In the first specification we
omit year fixed effects (columns 1 and 4) and in the second we include them (columns 2 and 5).
As can be seen in these baseline regressions, membership in the euro area alone is associated
with an increase in budget forecast over-optimism, though the increase is not statistically
significant at the 5% level.
In columns 3 and 6, we regress budget forecast errors on the contemporaneous output gap
OGt , a dummy variable for violation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure limit EDPt that is 1 if
the country's most recent budget deficit violates the 3% cap, a dummy variable Eurot that is 1 if
the country was a member of the euro area at the time the forecast was made, and interaction
terms. We also include year fixed effects to control for common time-varying shocks t.
BBEt+i =0+t.+1 OGt .+2 EDPt +3 Eurot +4 Eurot *OGt .+5 Eurot *EDPt +t+i .

The main result concerns the interaction between the dummy variable for membership in
the euro area and a violation of the EDP at the time the forecast was made (5). This coefficient
is large and positive in each specification at the one and two year horizons: when Euro area
countries are in violation of the EDP at the time a forecast is made, their one year forecasts are
biased by over 1.5% of GDP more than non-euro violators of the EDP limit. At the two year
14

Because the large majority of the three-year horizon forecast data we have comes from Stability and Convergence
Programs, in this section we only look at forecast errors at the one and two year horizon to ensure we have sufficient
observations from countries outside the euro area.

14

horizon, the point estimate is over 2% of GDP. In other words, even controlling for year fixed
effects, the level of the output gap, and a dummy for the common bias coming from deficits
larger than 3% of GDP, euro area countries that make their budget forecasts while in violation of
the deficit limit have forecasts that are 1.6% of GDP more over-optimistic at the one year
horizon than non-euro countries exceeding the 3% criterion. At the two year horizon, the effect is
even stronger, with Euro area countries that violate the EDP at the time a forecast is made having
forecast errors over 2% of GDP more over-optimistic than other countries with deficits that
large.
This result provides an enlightening interpretation of the result in Frankel (2011) that
Euro area countries are overall more over-optimistic in their budget deficits: in these regressions,
euro area forecast errors are comparable to non-euro area forecasts except that when the limits
set out in the EDP are breached euro members have very large over-optimistic forecast errors.
These regressions provide support for the idea that when faced with fiscal rules like the SGP,
countries find it tempting to adjust their forecasts to meet the criteria, rather than taking the
painful actions needed to meet the criteria in reality.
These bias estimates are quite large. They reflect in part the fact that these countries were
hit particularly hard during the 2009 financial crisis. Nevertheless, the fact that these countries
missed their forecasts so much more than other countries is quite interesting, especially since the
year fixed effects take out the mean effect of the global financial crisis on government budgets.

5. National Fiscal Rules
In this section, we examine the impact of national fiscal rules on official forecast errors.
Even though the eurozone’s fiscal compact was only agreed in late 2011, many of the members
already had rules at the national level. It should be possible to learn from their experience.
The fiscal constraints of the SGP provide a clear motivation for wishful thinking in the
forecasts, in order to avoid the political embarrassment of reprimands if not outright sanctions
from a supranational monitoring authority. It is not clear a priori if we should expect the same
sort of pattern for national rules. On the one hand, the country is “grading its own homework.”
Rather than the sovereign being monitored and disciplined by an external authority removed
from domestic politics, national fiscal rules are enforced by branches of the same government
that does the forecasting. On the other hand, national law and especially national constitutions
are often thought to take legal precedence over international agreements.

5.1 Fiscal Rule Index
Before turning to the examination of the impact of different types of fiscal rules on
budget balance forecast errors, we briefly describe the indices we use to measure the strength of
national fiscal rules. The underlying data on the classification of these rules come from the
European Commission's (EC) “Numerical Fiscal Rules in the EU Member States.”15 The
database provides the data at varied levels of aggregation. At the finest level, it provides details
on every individual fiscal rule in each EU member state from 1990 through 2010 (107 individual
rules). The European Commission classifies each fiscal rule as either a budget balance rule

15

Available at http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/fiscal_governance/fiscal_rules/index_en.htm .
The data on national fiscal rules in euroland were also applied to this problem by Zlatinova and Otto (2012).

16

(BBR), debt rule (DR), expenditure rule (ER) or revenue rule (RR). For each rule, the EC also
provides a numerical “Fiscal Rule Strength Index” (FRSI). This index is a weighted average of
five rule criteria: Statutory base of the rule, how much room the rule allows in setting or revising
objectives, the nature and independence of the monitoring and enforcement body, the
enforcement mechanisms of the rule, and visibility of the rule in the media.16
In order to construct an aggregate Fiscal Rule Index (FRI) for each country, the EC then
multiplies the FRSI by the fraction of general government finances covered by the rule. If only
one rule is in force in a country in a given year, this product of the FRSI and the fraction of
finances covered is the Fiscal Rule Index (FRI) for the year. If, however, multiple rules apply to
the same government sector17, they are ranked by the product of the fraction of government
finances they cover and their FRSIs; the strongest rule covering each government sector is given
a weight of 1, the second 1/2, the third 1/3, and so on. These weighted rules18 are then summed
to form the FRI. In the EC index, budget balance rules, debt rules, revenue rules, and expenditure
rules are all treated equally in the construction of the aggregate FRI.
These types of rules are conceptually different. Thus, rather than use the composite FRI
constructed by the EC, which is what Zlatinova and Otto (2012) do, we construct separate FRI's
for budget balance, debt, expenditure and revenue rules. We follow the same process used by the
EC in constructing the aggregate index in constructing our four separate indices. We then
normalize each of the indices to run between 0 and 1. For budget balance rules, the United
Kingdom’s budget balance rule in place from 1997-2008 achieved the highest score in sample

16

The FRSI indices use the random weights method as in Sutherland et. al. (2005).
Each rule is classified by the government sector that it covers: the central government, regional governments,
local governments and social security. A rule can also be classified as covering multiple sectors or the general
government. If one rule covers the general government sector and a second rule covers only certain sectors, the rule
covering the individual sector is discounted as it were the second rule covering that specific sector.
18
The weighted rules are (rule weight) X (coverage of general government finances) X (FRSI).
17

17

and is therefore given the value of one in our index.19 The budget balance rule index thus runs
from 0 (no budget balance rule) to rules comparably strong as the United Kingdom’s “Golden
Rule.” The countries for which we have data on national fiscal rules and sufficient budget
forecast data20 to include in the regressions are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom. Regression results that includes specific national fiscal rules is limited to these
countries, which are called “EC dataset countries” in the regressions.
Figure 6 plots these FRI for budget balance rules, revenue rules, expenditure rules, and
debt rules for all of the countries on which we have data.

5.2 Budget Balance Rules
Having constructed these indices, we next examine the impact of national budget balance
rules on budget forecast errors. In the first two columns of Table 6, we regress the one and two
year budget balance forecast errors on the output gap, the budget balance FRI (BBR FRIt) and an
interaction term. We find that stronger national budget balance rules are associated with a
statistically insignificant reduction in the amount of over-optimism in budget forecasts. In
columns 3 and 4, we mirror the Euro regressions of Table 5 by adding a dummy variable for a
deficit greater than 3% of GDP (EDPt ) and an interaction between this dummy and the budget
balance fiscal rule index. Whereas euro area countries that violate the excessive deficit procedure
at the time they are making budget forecasts make much more over-optimistic forecasts, the
effect is reversed when it comes to national budget balance rules (albeit statically insignificantly

19

The so-called “Golden Rule” restricted the general government to borrow only to finance investment rather than
current spending.
20
As in the previous sections, we require at least 10 budgets.

18

different from zero). Thus, while all countries with budget balances greater than 3% of GDP
generally have over-optimistic forecasts, this bias is reduced but not eliminated by stronger
national fiscal rules. This effect is in the opposite direction from the case of the supranational
SGP, although the 3% level is generally not the target of national budget balance rules.

5.3 Budget Balance Rules and the SGP
The final issue we address in this section is how exactly national budget balance rules interact
with the SGP. To examine this question, in the first two columns of Table 7 we regress budget
balance forecast errors on the contemporaneous output gap, the budget balance fiscal rule index,
a dummy for membership in the euro area and an interaction between national budget balance
rules and euro area membership.
BBEt+i =0+t.+1 OGt .+2 BBR FRIt +3 Eurot +4 Eurot *BBR FRIt +t+i .
The main result is that while membership in the euro area is associated with more overoptimistic budget balance forecasts, this effect is reduced when euro area membership is
combined with national budget balance rules. Although the direct effect of budget balance rules,
without conditioning on euro membership, is statistically insignificant (Table 6), the results of
the first two columns of Table 7 imply that national fiscal rules help reduce over-optimism when
counteracting the effect of a supranational rule.
The last four columns of Table 7 attempt to understand why national fiscal rules are
effective in reducing the bias in euro area forecasts. Since the over-optimism bias in the euro
area is mainly present when countries are already in violation of the statutory limit, we examine
whether national fiscal rules are effective in eliminating this specific bias. To do so, we look at
the coefficient on an interaction variable of Eurot*BBR FRIt*EDPt, a dummy variable for

19

membership in the euro area, the budget balance FRI, and a dummy variable for violation of the
3% limit. In columns 3 and 4, we include this interaction along with Eurot*EDPt , a dummy for
euro membership, a dummy for violation of the EDP and the output gap. We find that the
coefficient on the Eurot*EDPt variable is large, positive, and significant, confirming the earlier
result that euro area member forecasts are particularly biased when made at a time when the
deficit is larger than the 3% cap. However, this effect is greatly reduced if the country has fiscal
rules, as seen by the coefficient on Eurot*BBR FRIt*EDPt. Based on the point estimates, if a euro
country violating the EDP limit were to go from having no fiscal rule to adopting a rule as strong
as Britain’s Golden Rule, we estimate that forecast bias, at the one year horizon, would be no
more optimistic than that of a non-euro area country not in violation of the EDP limit
(.980+2.646-3.771). This is also the case for the two year horizon, which is particularly
interesting because even non-euro area countries have very biased forecasts when they have
deficits large enough that they would violate the 3% limit (the coefficient on the EDP dummy is
over 2). Therefore, strong fiscal rules can counteract not just the bias among euro area countries,
but also the bias that other countries with comparably large deficits face. In columns 5 and 6 we
repeat the analysis of columns 3 and 4 but include all possible interaction terms of EDP
violation, budget balance rules, and Euro area membership. The coefficients are nearly
unchanged from columns 3 and 4, though the individual coefficients lose some significance.

6. Independent fiscal institutions and the SGP
In this section, we consider the effect of combining budget balance rules with
independent government forecasts. As described in Frankel (2012), the Chilean government has
been successful in combining fiscal rules with a legal requirement to use forecasts of a panel of

20

independent experts in the government budget process. The European Commission has a
database on the role of independent fiscal institutions in the budgetary processes across EU
member states.21 Unfortunately it is not possible to create a proper time series as in the case of
the national budget balance rules.22
For each EU member, if the country has an independent fiscal institution the database
includes its date of creation, whether the government is required to consult with it during the
budgetary process, whether it is generally consulted despite the lack of a legal obligation,
whether it provides an analysis of fiscal policy with or without normative judgment, whether it
provides independent macroeconomic or budgetary forecasts, how the government is required to
use its forecasts during the budgetary process, and several other pieces of information.
In Table 8 we limit ourselves to using only one dimension of the database: whether a
country has an independent fiscal institution that provides independent forecasts of the general
government budget balance. While we would have liked to examine the impact of the
government being legally bound to use these forecasts, as in Chile, no country in the European
Union has a legal or constitutional obligation to use the independent forecasts.23
Therefore, we are limited to analyzing the effect that the existence of an independent
fiscal institution making independent forecasts has on the government's own forecasts. In Table
8, IND FBBt is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the country has an independent fiscal

21

Available at http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/fiscal_governance/independent_institutions/index_en.htm. The
European Commission defines independent fiscal institutions as “non partisan public bodies, other than the central
bank, government or parliament that prepare macroeconomic forecasts for the budget, monitor fiscal performance
and/or advise the government on fiscal policy matters.” The EC notes that one of the benefits of these institutions is
that they “can provide macroeconomic forecasts for the budget preparation that do not suffer from the optimistic
biases often found in official government forecasts.”
22
Other than through the dates the independent fiscal institutions were founded, the database does not include
whether the tasks performed by the institution or its legal position has changed since its inception. Therefore, we
assume that these characteristics are unchanged since the institutions were created.
23
In Austria, the government needs to justify publicly deviations from the forecasts of the Austrian Institute of
Economic Research.

21

institution that provides independent budget balance forecasts at time t.24 In Columns 3-4 of
Table 8, conditional on the current output gap and budget balance, the forecasting bias associated
with euro membership appears to be reduced in countries where independent fiscal institutions
provide independent budget balance forecasts. Without conditioning on the present budget
balance (Columns 1 and 2), the sign is the same and the magnitude is economically significant,
though not statistically so.
In columns 5 and 6, we examine whether independent forecasts can be helpful in
overcoming the tendency of euro area countries to offer more biased budget forecasts when they
are in violation of the 3% SGP limit. In Columns 5 and 6, we see this is in fact the case: although
euro area countries violating the EDP at the time a forecast is made (Eurot *EDPt ) offer more
optimistic forecasts, this bias is reduced for euro area countries violating the EDP that have
independent budget forecasts (Eurot *Ind FBBt*EDPt ). It is unclear why the direct effect of
independent forecasts and violations of the EDP (Ind FBBt *EDPt) is so strong at the two year
horizon. But even this strong effect is more than reversed by the effect for Eurot *Ind
FBBt*EDPt .
The regressions show that euro area governments making forecasts while in violation of
the EDP with an independent fiscal institution that makes independent budget forecasts have a
mean bias that is smaller by 2.9% of GDP at the one-year horizon and 2.6% of GDP at the two
year horizon, compared to a euro area country violating the EDP without such an independent
fiscal institution.
The causal interpretation of these results must be qualified: countries that place a high
value on the integrity of the forecasts may be less inclined to bias their budget forecasts and may

24

In constructing this variable, we assume that if the independent fiscal institution provides independent forecasts as
of 2010 that it provided these forecasts since the institution’s creation.

22

be more inclined to adopt national fiscal rules or create independent fiscal institutions compared
to other countries.

7. Conclusion
Our two most important conclusions can be stated succinctly. First, Euro area countries
appear to have responded to the 3% limit imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact by
offering over-optimistic forecasts when they are most in danger of breaching the limit.
Second, national budget balance rules or independent fiscal institutions that provide their
own independent forecasts help to reduce this bias.

Budget Balance and Growth Data Realizations
European countries: All realizations from Eurostat. For 1999-present, budget balance is Eurostat series EDP B.9,
net lending/net borrowing under the excessive deficit procedure, as this is the exact budget balance the European
countries forecast in their stability and convergence programs. Prior to 1999, the deficit is defined according to
ESA95 (series B.9). The difference between the two series differs in their treatment of interest relating to swaps and
forward agreements. In practice, the differences between the series are very small, but the ESA95 calculation
generally extends farther back than EDP B.9, which only goes back through 1995. See
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/en/gov_dd_esms.htm for more information.
For Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, budget balance realizations are taken from the
World Bank World Development Indicators. Budget balance realizationd for the United States are taken directly
from the Historical Tables included in the annual budget documents.
Similarly, all real GDP growth realizations for European countries come from Eurostat and from World
Development Indicators for the remaining countries with the exception of the United States. Because the United
States reports fiscal year GDP growth forecasts in the budget, US real GDP growth rate realizations are calculated
using the annual change in real GDP from Q3 over Q3 using data from Global Financial Data. Data on the level of
real GDP used to compute the output gap are from the same sources as real GDP growth.
