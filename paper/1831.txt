Intertemora1 Labor Supply
and Long Term flTp1oynEnt Contracts

ABSTRACT

In this paper we compare the implications of a symmetric information contracting model and a dynamic labor supply model for changes
in individual earnings and hours over time. The critical distinction
between these models is whether earnings represent optimal consumption
or payment for current labor services. We develop a simple test between
labor supply and contracting models based on the relative variability of
earnings and hours with respect to changes in productivity. If earnings
represent consumption then changes in productivity generate smaller
changes in earnings than hours. The opposite is true in the labor
supply model. We apply our test to longitudinal data on male household
heads fran the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National
Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, focusing on individuals who do not
change employers during the survey period. Neither model fits the data
well. In both surveys, however, the contrihition of changes in productivity to changes in earnings is greater than the contribution to
changes in hours. The data are more consistent with a labor supply
interpretation, although the estimated labor supply elasticities suggest
that changes in hours occur at fixed wage rates.

Despite rapid progress over the last decade in modeling employment
contractsi' and recent evidence on the importance of long—term jobs in

the economy, microeconomic studies of labor supply continue to
interpret individual hours and earnings data in terms of an auction

model of the labor market.-' Traditional labor supply analysis assumes
that earnings represent the product of desired hours and market wage

rates. Contracting models, on the other hand, interpret earnings
as optimal consumption for the payment period, including savings and

insurance payments from firms to workers.-" If savings and insurance
are important components of earnings, then average hourly earnings pro-

vide noisy information on underlying productivity.-" Contract models,
therefore, offer a Simple explanation for the weak link between wage
rates and hours that has confounded empirical studies of intertemporal
labor supply.--"

In this paper we compare the implications of life cycle labor
supply models and intertemporal contracting models for changes in indi-

vidual earnings and hours over time.ui We consider a standard dynamic
labor supply model in which individuals have access to complete capital
markets.

We compare this model to a symmetric information labor

contracting model in which employees receive complete insurance from

their employers. The critical distinction between the labor supply and
contracting models is whether earnings represent optimal consumption or

the product of wage rates and hours of work. We develop a simple test
between labor supply and contracting models based on the variability of

earnings with respect to changes in productivity. If earnings represent
the product of wages and hours, then changes in productivity generate

—2—

bigger changes in earnings than hours. If earnings represent consumption, on the other hand, then changes in productivity generate smaller
changes in earnings than hours, provided that leisure is a normal good.

This simple test is complicated by changes in wealth that may occur

with changes in productivity. For employees who are covered by implicit
contracts, however, wealth changes are ruled out by the form of the
optimal contract, which provides complete insurance against produc-

tivity risks. We therefore propose the following test of the implicit
contract model: compare the relative contribution of productivity
shocks to changes in earnings and changes in hours for workers who are

observed on the same job over time. If, as the intertemporal
contracting model suggests, these workers are fully insured, then the
contribution of productivity shocks to changes in earnings should be
smaller than the contribution of productivity shocks to changes in

hours. If the labor supply model is correct, then the contribution of
these shocks to changes in earnings should be greater than the contribution to changes in hours.

Our empirical analysis is conducted with data from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Older

Men (NLS). To focus attention on workers who are potentially covered by
long term contracts, we compare individuals who have the same employer
during the sample period and individuals who change employers at least

once. We find that earnings and hours changes are substantially less
variable for individuals with the same employer. For both groups of
workers, however, the contribution of productivity shocks to earnings is

—3--

greater than the contribution to hours. We conclude that earnings and
hours changes of long term employees are consistent with complete
interteinporal contracting only if one is prepared to accept that leisure

is a nonnormal good. The same data are consistent with an intertemporal
labor supply model, however, only if one is prepared to accept large

intertemporal substitution elasticities and significant differences
between those who change employers and those who do not.--' Neither a
symmetric information contracting model nor a dynamic labor supply model
with complete capital markets is likely to provide a complete description of individual labor market outcomes.

The first section of the paper presents a simple theoretical
analysis of intertemporal contracting and intertemporal labor supply.

For both models we derive the theoretical implications of aggregate
shocks, changes in tastes, productivity variation, and survey measurement error for the variances and covariances of earnings and hours

changes. These theoretical models provide the basis for our empirical
analysis.

In the second section of the paper we show how to estimate the
theoretical models using the "ariances, autocovariances, arid cross—

covariances of earnings and hours changes from individual longitudinal

data. A two—factor variance components model provides a convenient
framework for distinguishing productivity changes from other sources of
earnings and hours variation, including changes in tastes and measurement error.

In the third section of the paper we summarize the data from both

—4--

surveys and present estimates of the structural parameter that

distinguishes the contracting and labor supply models. The covariance
structure of earnings and hours changes is remarkably similar in the two
surveys.
earnings

Our main

finding is that productivity variation affects

at least as much as hours. This is true for individuals who

have the same employer-in all years and for those who change employers.
The data therefore provide some evidence against a contracting interpretation, although they suggest that productivity—related changes in
earnings and hours occur at more or less fixed wage rates.

I. Earnings and Hours Under Long Term Contracting Models and Life Cycle
Labor Supply Models
In this section we present a simple dynamic model of earnings and

hours determination under long term employment contracts. We also present a model of earnings and hours determination under a standard life

cycle labor supply framework. We make identical environmental and preference assumptions in both models. For the contracting model we assume
that employers have access to complete capital and insurance markets.

For the labor supply model we assume that individuals have direct access

to these markets. The resulting empirical models encompass existing
symmetric information contracting models and dynamic labor supply

models. Our empirical models, therefore, contrast a widely—used version
of the intertemporal labor supply model with a class of testable
contracting models.

Individual productivity is modeled as a random variable drawn from
a sequence of distributions that are common knowledge for both workers

—5—

and firms. Productivity is the only source of uncertainty in the model.
Apart from firm—specific training and recruiting costs, individuals are

equally productive at all firms. Long term attachments between workers
and firms arise from two sources: the desire to avoid recurrent
training costs, which occurs in either the contracting or labor supply
model; and the desire to smooth consumption vis—a—vis productivity,

which is associated with long term attachments in the contracting model.
Preferences for consumption and leisure within periods are modeled
as a general function of consumption, hours of work, and age.

Preferences are assumed to be additively separable over time and across

states of productivity. The worker's intertemporal objective is to
maximize the expected discounted value of life—time utility. In the
contracting model the expectation is taken over the distribution of

individual productivities. In the labor supply model the expectation is
taken over the distribution of market wages, which is assumed to be
identical to the distribution of individual productivities.

The parameter p represents the relative sensitivity of consumption and

that is, if consumption is more variable than hours with respect to

changes in productivity, then leisure is an inferior good. If 6 > 0 is
treated as a maintained hypothesis, then the intertemporal contracting

model presents one testable implication: namely, that changes in productivity influence hours at least as ntich as earnings, on average.

Now consider the intertemporal labor supply irodel. We assume that
workers have access to risk—neutral insurance and capital markets so
that the life cycle budget constraint can be replaced by its

Under the labor supply interpretation of earnings and hours the para-

Since earnings represent the product of wages and hours in the labor

supply model, earnings must respond more than hours to changes in productivity.

Our analysis of the contracting model shows that the elasticity of
earnings with respect to productivity is less than the elasticity of

hours with respect to productivity if leisure is a normal good. Our
analysis of the intertemporal labor supply model shows that the relation

between these elasticities is reversed under identical assumptions.-'
In the next section we develop a statistical model for estimating the

critical parameter p , the ratio of the two elasticities.

II. Econometric Models for the Covariance Structure of Earnings
and Hours Changes
Our empirical strategy is to use equations (5) and (8) as the basis

for a description of the sources of variation in earnings and hours over

time. Individual productivity enters as an unobserved component of
variance in both earnings and hours. Other components include variation

—10—

in preferences for consumption and leisure, and survey measurement
error. We derive the implications of this variance components model for
the covariance structure of earnings and hours changes in longitudinal

survey data. Since the sample covariances are easily computed, it is
straightforward to summarize the empirical success or failure of the
model in terms of its actual fit to the data.
The first step is to express equations (5a) and (5b) in first dif-

ference form taking account of individual—specific components. Since
earnings are identical to consumption in the contracting model, we

substitute log

for log c. Let A log

and A log hit

represent the changes in the logarithms of real annual earnings and

annual hours for individual i between periods t—l and t, respectively. Append a survey measurement error ut to the expression for

for log g and a survey measurement error

to the expression for

for log hit. Then, equations (5) imply:

(lOa) A log gfr =

(lOb) A log hi =

A log B — a (p—r) + A
n A log

+ A u

+ 6 (p—r) + A b1 + A v.

Since employers can perfectly insure individual productivity variation,
changes in the discounted marginal utility of wealth only contribute the

constant (p—r) to equations (ba) and (lob). In the labor supply
model the equation for the change in hours is identical to (lob). The
equation for the change in earnings in the labor supply model, however, is

(11) A log g = (l+n) A log

+ 6 (p—r) + A b.t + A

—11—

Equations (lOa) and (11) are very similar. The statistically identifiable difference between the models arises from the different coef-

ficients on the change in individual productivity. To clarify this
point, we complete the model by specifying the covariance structure of

log

'

a

,

bj

,

and

,

We adopt a linear specification for individual productivity con-

sisting of a permanent individual effect (er) , an aggregate time

effect (dr) , a quadratic labor force experience effect, and a purely

stochastic component (zj):

log e1 =

O

÷

+ dt + O x1 + 1/2

where x1 represents the labor force experience of individual i at
the beginning of year t.

Since labor force experience increases by one

each year, the change in the logarithm of individual productivity is:

(12)

log 0it =

+

e X0 + Z1

where x0 represents the labor force experience of individual i at
the beginning o the survey and

is a time effect that incorporates

the change in the aggregate productivity shock as well as the change in
average labor force experience.---"
In a similar fashion, we assume that the preference variations

(air and bj) contain permanent individual effects, aggregate time
effects, quadratic experience effects, and stationary, serially uncorre—
lated random components:

ait =ai +at + axit

÷1/2ca X2
it

alt

—12—

bit = b1

+ b + b it + 1/2 b

+ 6bit

These specifications permit individual preferences for consumption and

leisure to exhibit homogeneous curvature over the lifecycle. The vector

of deviations from the life cycle profile of preferences (c. ebit)
is assumed to be independent and identically distributed for all i and
t with an unrestricted contemporaneous covariance matrix. The first
differences of the preference variations can be written as:

Kat + axiO

(l3a) Aa.it

ait

(l3b) A b. = Kb + b x0 + A

where Kat and Kb

are composite time effects that incorporate

changes in a and b as well as changes in average labor force
16/

experience.—

Finally, we assume that the vector of survey measurement errors

(ut, vt) contains permanent and purely transitory errors:

it

u + C uit

it

=v+C
i
vit

=

i

The permanent errors, represented by u and v , model systematic
deviations of the survey instrument from the theoretically appropriate

concepts. We assume that the vector of transitory errors, (ei
€vit) is independent and identically distributed with an unrestricted
contemporaneous covariance matrix. The first differences of the
measurement errors can be written as:

(14a) A it
u =

A

c

uit

—13—

(14b) A v =

c1

A

Equations (14a) and (14b) indicate that only the transitory measurement
errors contritxite to the covariance structure of earnings and hours

changes. Permanent response biases are eliminated by first—
differencing.

Apart from time effects, preference variation and survey measure-

ment errors are statistically indistinguishable, since the first
differences of both components represent first differences of uncorre—

lated vectors. For simplicity, we combine the preference variation com-

ponents, A Cait and A
components, A c

and A c

components (A u1, ,

A

with

,

vit

the survey measurement error

to form a single vector of variance

v.). In the labor contract model, the pre-

ference variation and measurement error components of variance in
earnings and hours changes is given by:

(l5a) A

(15b) A v1 A

In the labor supply model, on the other hand, the preference variation
and measurement error component of variances in earnings and hours is
given by:

(15a') A u. =

A

Cbi +

In either case, the vector (A u. , A v) is independently and identically distributed across individuals with an arbitrary contemporaneous

covariance matrix and a known autocovariance structure. Specifically,

—14—

the vector (A uft , A vj) is a bivariate first order moving average

and

changes in y more than one period apart are uncorrelated.
Combining equations (12)—(15), the equations for the changes in log
earnings and log hours in the labor contracting models can be simplified
to:

ference variation and survey measurement errors as in equation (15); and

(12). For the labor supply model, the hours equations is the same as
(16b). The equation for earnings, on the other hand, becomes

Neither the labor supply model nor the labor contracting model,

however, imposes any restrictions on the year effects or experience

slopes of equations (16) and (17). Under our assumptions, individual
productivity changes and preference variations contribute three

unrestricted time effects (icet K, and Kbt) to the changes in log
earnings and log hours in the labor contract model, or two unrestricted

time effects (icet cbt) in the labor supply model. The cross—

sectional means of A log gft and A log h.t in period t (controlling
for experience) are sufficient to estimate only two linear combinations

of these effects (Kgt and Kht). Similarly, there are three
unrestricted labor force experience effects

a'

and

in the

labor contract model, or two unrestricted experience effects

in the labor supply model. Again, however, we can only identify two

experience slopes (g and

Therefore, the coefficients of the

multivariate regression of individual i's changes in log earnings and
log hours on time effects and initial labor force experience are
unrestricted by either model)-2'

Equations (16) and (17) do, however, provide a simple two—factor
model for the residuals from the regression of changes in individual
earnings and hours on time effects and labor force experience.

According to these equations, unpredicted changes in earnings and hours
contain a time—stationary preference and measurement error component,

with a known autocorrelation structure, and a productivity component,
with an arbitrary autocorrelation structure.
The relative contribution of productivity changes to earnings and

hours changes depends on the parameters

and

In

the absence of

direct information on the variance of individual productivity shocks
these parameters are not separately identifiable from the covariance

structure of earnings and hours changes. The critical parameter p,
which measures the relative contribution of productivity changes to

earnings as compared to hours is over—identified, hever. First, p
is identifiable if changes in earnings and hours exhibit second—order or
higher autocorrelation, since the preference variation and measurement
error component only contributes first order autocorrelation.
Second, p

is identifiable if the first order autocorrelations of

earnings and hours changes are not identically equal to _1/2, since the

preference variation and measurement error component has all first order

autocorrelations equal to —1/2. Third, p

is identifiable if the autoco—

variances and cross—covariances of earnings and hours changes are not
time—stationary, since the preference variation and measurement error
component is assumed to be stationary.

While p is identifiable from the covariance structure of earnings
and hours changes, the variance contributions of changes in productivity, preference shifts and measurement errors are not separately

identifiable. All components contribute to the variances and first—
order autocovariances of changes in earnings and hours. It is
impossible to determine their separate contributions without further
assumptions on either the serial correlation properties of the productivity shocks, or the correlations of the measurement errors and preference variations.

Table 1 displays the theoretical formulas for the autocovariances
and cross—covariances of earnings and hours changes implied by equations

(16) and (17). The variables A log
the deviations of A log

and A log

are defined as

and A log hits respectively, from their

conditional means given t and x10. We refer to these variables as
experience—adjusted changes in log earnings and log hours. The formulas

are written in terms of the parameter p so that they apply to either
20/

the contracting or labor supply model.— Table 1 shows how the
covariance structure of earnings and hours changes depends on the

covariance structure of individual productivity changes (A z.), the
covariance structure of the preference variation and measurement error

process (A u and A

)

and

p. The formulas in Table 1 form the

basis for our empirical test of the contracting model versus the labor
supply model.

III. A Test of the Contracting Model Versus the Labor Supply Model
Using Longitudinal Data on Adult Males
The longitudinal earnings and hours data used in this paper are
drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National
Longitudinal Survey of Older 'len. From the PSID we selected 1448 male
household heads whose records indicate nonzero earnings and hours in
each year from 1969 to 1979 (the third through thirteenth waves of the

survey). We included only those male household heads who were between
the ages of 21 and 64 in all eleven sample years. The "one—employer"
subsample was defined on the basis of answers to the questions about

present employment status and reason for changing employment status. If

—18—

an individual was currently employed or temporarily laid off and
reported having the same job at least one year (including promotions),
then the individual was considered to have the same employer as in the

previous year. An individual with the same employer as in the previous
year for all years from 1970 to 1979 was included in the one—employer

subsample. There were 618 individuals who satisfied this condition.
The remaining 830 individuals were included in the "multiple—employers"

subsample. Every member of the multiple—employers subsample experienced
at least one change of employer during the period from 1969 to 1979.

Table 2 presents means and standard deviations of the changes in log
real annual earnings, and log annual hours, as well as basic demographic
variables for the PSID sample and subsamples.
From the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men we selected 1309

men whose records indicate nonzero earnings and hours for each of the
years 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1973, and 1975.---" We included only those
males who were between the ages of 45 and 64 in all six sample years.

The one—employer subsample was defined on the basis of the number of
years the individual had worked for his current employer in 1971 and

whether or not the individual worked for a different employer in 1973 or

1975. An individual who had worked for his current employer at least
5 years in 1971 and who did not change employers in either 1973 or

1975 was included in the one—employer subsample. All

others

were

Included in the multiple—employers subsample. Means and standard
deviations for the NLS sample are also presented in Table 2. For the
interpretation of the NLS data, It is important to note that later waves

—19—

of the survey were administered biennially. The changes in earnings
and hours from 1969 to 1975 refer to changes in annual totals dif—

ferenced over two—year intervals. These changes are not reported at
annual rates in Table 2.

Table 2 shows that average age and potential labor force experience
(age minus years of education minus five) differ substantially between
the PSID and NLS samples because of design differences in the underlying

surveys. The NLS workers are an average of 13.3 years older and 15.5
years more experienced than the PSID workers. We experience—adjust all
subsequent calculations in this paper to correct for systematic differences between the PSID and NLS samples arising from this difference

in labor force experience. Both surveys also over—sampled nonwhites.
The percentage of nonwhites is similar in our two samples, however, and
we make no further adjustments to account for the small difference in
22/

racial composition between them.— There are no important differences
in age, labor force experience or percentage nonwhite between the one—
employer and multiple—employers subsamples of either survey.

Table 2 reveals three striking features of the individual earnings

and hours data

from our two samples. First, the overall pattern of

changes in earnings and hours is similar in the two surveys. This
conclusion applies when comparing all individuals, individuals with one

employer, and individuals with multiple employers. The older sample
(NLS) experienced slightly larger changes (in absolute value) during the

1973 to 1975 period than the younger sample (PSID). Individuals in the
multiple—employer subsample of each survey experienced substantially

—20—

larger changes during this period than those in the one—employer

subsamples. Second, there is significant nonstationarity in the standard deviations of changes in earnings and hours. In the PSID sample
earnings and hours changes are most variable in the 1975—1976 period and

least variable in the 1972—1973 period. In the NLS sample these changes
are most variable in the 1973—1975 period and least variable in the

1969—1971 period. This pattern of nonstationarity is apparent in the
one—employer and multiple—employers subsamples of both surveys. Third,
the standard deviations of earnings and hours changes for the one—
employer subsample are much smaller than the standard deviations for the

multiple—employers subsample of both surveys. Individuals who do not
change employers experience less variability in earnings and hours corn—
23/

pared to individuals who change employers.—
Our

theoretical

analysis of the contracting and labor supply models

focuses on their implications for the autocovariances and cross—

covariances of earnings and hours changes. Table 3 presents the average
cross—covariances of the PSID and NLS samples.--" The similarity bet-

ween the two samples extends to their covariance structure. Both
samples and all the subsamples exhibit strong positive correlations bet-

ween contemporaneous changes in earnings and hours, and strong negative

autocorrelation in earnings and hours changes. This similarity is even
more remarkable since the PSID data represent year—to—year changes,

while the NLS data represent changes in annual data over two—year
intervals.

In contrast to the first—order autocovariances of earnings and

—21—

hours changes, the second—order autocovariances are relatively small,

although nonzero in the PSID at least. The higher—order autocovariances
(not reported in Table 3) are generally small and mixed in sign. Row 12
of Table 3 contains the test statistics for a test that the third— and

higher—order autocovariances of earnings and hours changes are jointly

equal to zero. This hypothesis is not rejected for any of the NLS
samples or the complete PSID sample. These samples are therefore consistent with a (nonstationary) bivariate second—order moving average

(MA(2)) model of earnings and hours changes.--' There is some evidence
of third— and higher—order serial covariation in the one—employer and

multiple-employers subsamples of the PSID. These covariances are of
trivial magnitude, however, and we choose to assume that they are zero

in the interest of parauteric simpiicity.--"
For both complete samples and for all the subsamples except the

one—employer subsample of the NLS there is strong evidence of nonsta—

tionarity in the covariances of earnings and hours changes. The goodness—of—fit of a stationary model of the cross—covariances of earnings
and hours (up to second order) is recorded in the last row of Table 3.

Judging by these test statistics, at least one of the variance components generating the changes in earnings and hours in the PSID and NLS
surveys is nonstationary.

Table 3 also shs that the first—order autocorrelations of
earnings and hours changes are negative but smaller than 1/2 in absolute
27/

value for both samples and all the subsaniples.—

Similarly, the ratios

of the first—order cross—covariances of earnings and hours changes to

—22--

their corresponding zero—order covariances are all negative and smaller
than 1/2 in absolute value.----' In the framework of our two factor model,

the fact that these autocorrelations are smaller than 1/2 in absolute

value is evidence of a productivity component in earnings and hours. A
pure measurement error model of the data implies that these autocorrela—
tions are all exactly equal to —1/2.

To summarize the evidence in Table 3, the covariance structure of

changes in earnings and hours is consistent with a second—order

bivariate moving average model. Third— and higher—order autocovarlances
and

cross—covariances

are approximately zero in both the PSID and NLS

surveys. In addition, both samples and all the subsamples (i) exhibit
second—order serial correlation, (if) exhibit covariance nonsta—
tionarity, and (iii) have first—order autocorrelatfons less than 1/2 in

absolute value. Since any one of these three conditions is sufficient
to identify the relative contribution of productivity shocks to earnings

as compared to hours, the parameter p is empirically identified.
Table 1 describes the expected values of the variances, autoco—
variances, and cross—covariances of experience—adjusted earnings and.

hours changes in terms of the autocovariance structure of individual
productivity and the covariance structure of preference variation and

measurement error. Estimation of p and tests of the goodness—of—fit
of the statistical model described in Table 1 require that we

paraneterize the autocovariance structure of individual productivity

changes. We use two different parameterizations. In the first case we
assume that

z. is a stationary second—order moving average.2" in

—23—

the second case we asstmie that A z1 is a nonstationary second—order
moving average.--1 If individual productivity is stationary, the
bivariate process for earnings and hours changes described in Table 1 is

stationary. While we have strong evidence against a stationary
covariance structure, the advantage of a stationary model is that the
sufficient statistics for estimation of the structural parameters are

just the average variances and covariances reported in Table 3. If
individual productivity is a nonstationary second-order moving average,

on the other hand, the sufficient statistics for estimation of the
structural parameters are all the elements of the complete covariance

matrix of earnings and hours changes up to second order. In both
cases, we use the method of uments estimator based on minimizing the
distance between the sample covariance matrix and the theoretical

covariance matrix implied by Table 1 to estimate 1 and the goodness—
of—f it of the structural models.--"

Table 4 reports the goodness—of—fit and the estimates of p from
both samples and all subsamples.-' The upper panel of the Table contains the estimates for a stationary parameterization of individual pro-

ductivity changes. The goodness—of—fit statistics are large, even in
comparison to the goodness—of—fit statistics for an unrestricted sta-

tionary covariance model (reported in the last row of Table 3). The

estimates of p are all in excess of one, and are actually larger for
the one—employer subsamples than for the multiple—employer subsamples or

the overall samples. The estimates of p for the one—employer samples
are relatively imprecise, however, and one is within two standard errors

—24—

of both estimates.

The lower panel of Table 4 contains the estimates of i

and the

goodness—of—fit statistics for a non—stationary parameterization of

individual productivity changes. This model fits the data better in all

cases, although the estimates of p are not such affected. The non—
stationary model actually provides an acceptable fit to the one—employer

subsample of the NLS. For the other subsamples and the two complete
samples the two factor model of the covariance structure of earnings and
hours changes is rejected.

The point estimates of p from the one—employer subsamples provide
evidence against the intertemporal contracting model of earnings and

hours changes, and in favor of the intemporal labor supply model. The
associated estimates of the intemporal substitution elasticity (n)

are

recorded in rows 2 and 5 of Table 4.--' In the PSID one—employer

sample, the estimates of r from the stationary and nonstationary
models are 1.84 and .68, respectIvely. These estimates are larger than
the instrumental variables estimates reported by Altonji (1986) and
MaCurdy (1981) for PSID males, although they are based on a very different methodology.----" In the NLS one—employer sample, the estimates of

i are .29 for the stationary model and .32 for the nonstationary model.
These estimates are comparable to other estimates based on individual
longitudinal data.

While the results from the one—employer subsamples are relatively
favorable to the labor supply interpretation of earnings and hours
changes, the results from the multiple—employer samples and the complete

—25--

samples

reveal a difficulty with the labor supply interpretation. In

the contracting model, changes in employer represent changes between

contracts. The contract model therefore offers a simple explanation for
the greater variability of earnings and hours for those who change

employers than those who do not. The labor supply model, on the other
hand, applies the samemodel to changes in earnings and hours within and
across jobs. The labor supply model by itself does not explain the
higher variation in earnings and hours changes for those who change

jobs. The labor supply model also predicts the same relative effect of
productivity

shocks on earnings and hours for job changers and stayers.

The point estimates of p for the multiple—employer subsamples,
however, are very different from the estimates based on the one—employer
subsamples.

is

In both the PSID and NLS multiple—employer subsamples, p

precisely estimated and close to, but greater than, one. The implied

estimates of the intertemporal substitution elasticity are large and
imprecise.

The estimates of p for individuals who change employers suggest
that productivity changes affect earnings and hours proportionately. In
other words, for these individuals, hours vary at fixed wage rates. One
simple explanation for this finding in the framework of a labor supply

model is that individuals cannot fully insure productivity risks. In
this case, our estimation strategy confounds changes in productivity and

changes in the marginal utility of wealth. Since changes in the marginal utility of wealth influence earnings and hours proportionately in

the labor supply model, p is biased towards one if we incorrectly

—26—

impose the assption of complete insurance. In other work, however, we
have found that estimates of p are unaffected by controlling for
changes in the marginal utility of wealth (Abowd and Card (1985)). The
evidence that changes in earnings and hours occur at constantwage rates
is inconsistent with either labor supply models or the contracting

models considered in this paper. Fixed wage contract models have been

considered by Abd and Orley Ashenfelter (1981), and applied in the
macroeconomics literature by Stanley Fischer (1977) and John Taylor

(1980), among others. Our results for the job changers suggest that
these models may be useful in the empirical analysis of Individual data
as well.

Finally, Table 4 also reports parameter estimates for the complete

PSID and NLS samples. It is clear from these estimates that the characteristics of the multiple—employer subsainpies carry over to the complete

samples. In the complete samples changes in productivity have slightly
larger effects on earnings than hours, although we cannot easily reject
the hypothesis that productivity—induced changes in hours occur at fixed

wage rates (i.e., p1).
IV. Conclusion
Our

goal

in this paper was to develop an empirical strategy for

testing between intertemporal contracting models and labor supply

models. Such a test must rely on the fundamental distinction between
contracting and labor supply models: in contracting models earnings
represent optimal consumption whereas In labor supply models earnings

—27—

represent the product of wage rates and hours of work. We derive a
testable contrast between the two models based on the relative variabi-

lity of changes in earnings and changes In hours. If the contracting
models Is correct, earnings are less variable than hours with respect

to changes in productivity. If the labor supply model is correct, the
reverse is true.

In order to apply the test, we specify a complete model of earnings

and hours variation, including productivity components and components

due to changes in tastes and measurement errors. The statistical model

implied by either theory

Is itself testable. This test provides a

check on the ability of either theory to explain the covariance properties of earnings

and

hours changes in longitudinal data.

We apply the model to longitudinal data from the PSID and NLS sur—

veys. Generally speaking, the data are inconsistent with the
covariance structure implied by either

the

simple

labor supply or contracting

model. Contrary to the implications of the contracting model, the
contrilxition of productivity shocks to earnings as at least as large as

the contrilution to hours. This Is true for individuals with the
same employer

over

the

entire period of

the PSID and NLS surveys,

more generally. Fran the point of view of

and also

the labor supply model,

hever, the implied intertemporal substitution elasticities are large
and imprecise. A simpler interpretation of the data is that
productivity—related changes In hours

conclude

occur at fixed

wage rates. We

that the specification and testing of fixed wage contracting

models for individual earnings and hours data should be a high priority
for future research.

Robert E. Lucas, Jr. and Leonard Rapping (1969) use a two period model
in their influential study of intertemporal substitution and labor

supply. Multiperiod labor supply is considered by James Heckman (1974,
1976), Gilbert Ghez and Gary Becker (1975), and many subsequent authors
(see in particular Thomas MaCurdy (1981) ). The modern analysis of

implicit contract models begins with Walter Oi (1962) and Sherwin Rosen

(1968). The macroeconomic implications of employment contracts are
emphasized by Martin N. Baily (1974), Donald Gordon (1974) and Costas
Azariadis (1975).

our paper "On the Covariance Structure of Earnings and Hours
Changes" (1985) we find that this conclusion is not altered by
controlling for wealth effects arising from uninsured productivity
changes.

and the NLS yields an estimate of

22!The experience slopes of earnings and hours changes are actually

restricted to be constant over time. Both the contracting model and the
labor supply model imply this restriction, given our model for indivi-

dual productivity and preference variations. The experience slopes from

the PSID are consistent with this restriction (x2 = 25.80 with 18
degrees of freedom, probability value =

from the NLS are not consistent with this restriction (x2 = 40.96 with

might ask if variability of earnings and hours changes for
the multiple—employers subsamples is similar to the one—employer sub—
samples if we consider only those years that do not involve employer

changes. The answer is yes. In the PSID sample, in which we have
annual data sampled at an annual rate, individuals experience substantial variability in earnings and hours changes during the three year

period surrounding the change in employer. For the NLS sample, in which
we cannot perform such a detailed year—to—year analysis because we have

annual data sampled at a biennial rate, it is still true that most of
difference in variation between the multiple—employer and one—employer
subsamples occurs because of the variability contributed by the period

in which the employer change actually occurred. Put differently, most
of the added variability in earnings and hours changes for the many—

employers sample occurs around the time of employer changes. There is
no substantial difference between the one-employer and multiple—employer

subsamples when data fran employer changes are excluded. See Altonji
and Paxson (1985) for a detailed comparison of hours variability between
job changers and stayers in the PSID.

The complete covariance matrix of earnings and hours changes for

the PSID contains 210 unique elements; the complete covariance matrix

for the NLS contains 55 unique elements. Estimates of these matrices
(with standard errors) for the complete samples are contained in Abowd

and Card (1985). The covariances reported in Table 3 represent simple
averages of the covariances for each year of the PSID or NLS survey.
