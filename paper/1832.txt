On the Covariance Stricture of Earnings and HOUrS Changes

ABSTRPCT

This paper presents an empirical analysis of changes in individual

earnings and hours ov&r time. Using longitudinal data from three panel
surveys, we catalogue the main features of the covariance structure of

changes

in

earnings and hours. We then present an interpretation of

these features in terms of both a life—cycle labor supply model and a

fixed—wage labor contract nDdel. Our major findings are:

(1) there is

a remarkable similarity in the covariance structure of earnings and
hours changes across the three surveys; and (2) apart from simple

measurement error, the major component of variance in earnings and
hours affects earnings and hours equi—proportionately.

Recent empirical studies of longitudinal earnings and hours data
focus on the contemporaneous correlation between hours of work and

average hourly earnings.L" This focus arises naturally from the life—

labor supply model, which explains movements in hours over time in

observed variation in hours over time is not explained by contemporaneous

movements in wages)'

correlation

On one hand, the cross—sectional

between percentage changes in annual hours and percentage

changes in average hourly earnings is apparently dominated by measure-

ment error.' On the other hand, state—of—the—art estimates of the

life—cycle labor supply model yield small and often statistically
insignificant elasticities between hours variation and wage movements.-"
In

this paper, we present a more general analysis of the relation

between movements in earnings and movements in hours over time.' Using
longitudinal

data from three panel surveys, we catalogue the main

features of the covariance structure of earnings and hours. We then

present an interpretation of these features in terms of both a life—
cycle

labor supply model and a model of fixed—wage labor contracts. Our

major findings are:

(1) there is remarkable similarity in the

covariance structure of earnings and hours changes across the three data
sources and (2) apart from simple measurement error, the major component
of variance in earnings and hours affects earnings and hours equi—
proportionately.

In

the first section of the paper, we describe the covariance

—2—

matrix of changes in annual earnings and annual hours of work for male
household heads in three panel surveys:

the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (PSID); the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men (NLS);

and the control group of the Seattle and Denver Income Maintenance

Experiment (SINE/DIME). Using method—of—moments estimation techniques,
we test for parsimonious representations of the data from all three sur-

veys. We find that changes in earnings and changes in hours are
uncorrelated at lags in excess of two years in the PSID and the NLS, and

at lags in excess of one year in the SINE/DIME. We also find evidence
of nonstationarity In the covariances of earnings and hours from all
three data sources.

In the second section of the paper, we present a life cycle labor
supply model and derive its Implications for the data described in

Section I. We also discuss the implications of a labor contracting
model in which hours of work are varied by employers with no
corresponding change in average hourly earnings.
In the third section of the paper, we present estimation results

for a simple two—factor model of earnings and hours generation. Th.e
model for earnings and hours consists of a systematic component
(reflecting individual productivity in the labor supply model or changes

in labor demand in the alternative model) and an unsystematic or

measurement error component. The estimation results reveal that both
cnponents are important in the data, and that the systematic component
generally influences earnings and hours equi—proportionare].y. This
leads us to conclude that most observed changes In earnings and hours

that are not attributable to measurement error occur at fixed average

I. Data Description
The

longitudinal earnings and hours data in this paper are drawn

from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the National Longitudinal

Survey of Older Men, and the nonexperimental families in the Seattle and
Denver Income Maintenance Experiment. From the PSID, we have drawn
1448 male household heads whose records indicate nonzero earnings and
hairs in each year from 1969 to 1979 (the

of the survey). A brief summary

1971, 1973 and l975.' Table 2 summarizes the characteristics

of the

sample. Average annual hours for this older sample of men decline

—4—

throughout the nine—year sample period, particularly between 1973 and

1975. In interpreting the NLS data, it is important to keep in mind
that the later waves of the survey were administered biennally. As a
consequence, the changes in earnings and hours from 1969 to 1975 refer
to changes in annual totals over two—year intervals.

From the Seattle and Denver Income Maintenance Experiment we have

drawn

a sample of 560 male household heads who enrolled in the control

group

of the experiment.-" These male heads were between 21 and 64 years

of age during the first four years of the experiment, and reported nonzero earnings and hours in each of the first eight experimental half—

year periods. We excluded a small number of heads who reported more
than 2500 hours of work in any one of the six month periods. The size
of the SINE/DINE sample reflects the relatively small initial survey and
the reduction in sample size associated with the requirement of eight
periods of labor market data.

The demographic characteristics of the SINE/DIME sample and time

series information on earnings and hours are recorded in Table 3. Labor
market information in the income experiment was collected every four
months and aggregated into six—month data by the experiment's contrac-

tors. Since enrollment dates differ by household, the experimental
periods correspond to different periods of calendar tine for different

households. The first experimentalperiod, for example, contains data
from calendar periods between early 1971 and late 1972.

Like the other two samples the SINE/DIME control group over repre-

sents low—income and nonwhite households. Average hours of work

The complete covariance matrices oF changes in the logarithms of

Tables 4, 5, and 6.

of the data are not signt[icantly affected by removing

the predicted effects of experience, since the explanatory power of the

experience regressions is negligible in all these data sets. The
covariances of the changes in earnings and hours with potential
experience are recorded in the final rows of the Tables.

To control for the fact that the SIME/DIME data are drawn from different calendar periods, depending on the date of assignment into the
experiment, changes in earnings and hours from the SIME/DIME were
regression adjusted using potential experience and a series of indicator
variables for month—of—assignment into the experiment.

In none of the

sixteen regressions for the eight changes in earnings and

hours

were

—6--

these

indicator variables jointly statistically significant at conven-

tional significance levels, however.

Table 4 contains the covariances of changes in the logarithms of
annual earnings and annual hours for our sample of household heads from

the PSID. The upper left hand triangle of the table presents the
covariances of changes in earnings and their associated standard errors.

The lower right hand triangle of the table presents the covariances of

changes in annual hours. The lower left hand block contains the cross—
covariances

between changes in earnings and hours.

The cross—sectional variation in percentage changes in annual
earnings

and hours is large: the standard deviation of the change in

the logarithm of earnings is at least 35 percent, while the standard
deviation of the change in the logarithm of annual hours is at least 25

percent. The variances and covariances of changes in annual earnings
and hours also vary over time. Cross—sectional dispersion in earnings
and hours growth

is relatively small in 1972—73 and 1973—74,

and rela-

tively large in 1975—76. In contrast to aggregate time series data,
consecutive changes in individual earnings and hours are strongly nega-

tively correlated. The first—order serial correlation coefficients of
the changes in earnings and hours range from —.25 to — .45.

The first—

order serial cross—correlations of earnings and hours are also negative,
although smaller in absolute value (between —.15 and —.25) than the
corresponding autocorrelations.

The contemporaneous covariances of changes in earnings and hours
for household heads in the PSID are significantly positive, although too

earnings is the difference in the logarithms of annual earnings

and annual hairs, the covariance between changes in annual hours and

changes in average hourly earnings is just the difference between the
covariance

in hours.

of changes in earnings and hours and the variance of changes

For all ten changes in Table 4 this difference is negative

and well determined.

A final important feature of the covariance matrix in Table 4 is
the absence of any large or statistically significant autocovariances at

lags greater than two years. Year—to—year changes in earnings and hours
in the p510 are apparently well—represented as a nonstationary bivariate
second—order moving average process.

Table 5 presents the covariance matrix of five experience—adjusted
changes in earnings and hours from the NLS. Overall, the data are very
similar to the corresponding data from the PSID, although there is more

evidence of nonstationarity in the NLS data. On
the second—order autocovariances

the

other hand, none of

or cross—covariances in

Table 5

are

large or statistically significant, so that the NLS data may perhaps be
adequately suinnarized as a nonstationary bivariate first—order moving

average (MA(l)) process. If changes in annual earnings and hours
between conseaitive years are represented by a second—order moving
average process (NA(2)) then changes in hours and earnings at two—year
gaps are represented by a first—order moving average.2' Thus the data

in Tables 4 and 5 are potentially consistent with the se underlying
model of earnings and hours generation.

—8—

Table 6 presents the covariances of experience—adjusted changes in
earnings and hours between consecutive six—month intervals in the

SINE/DIME survey. Again, these covariances are similar to the covari—
ances of the PSID and NLS samples. There is less evidence of nonsta—
tionarity in the SINE/DINE than in the other two surveys, although this

may reflect the fact that changes in earnings and hours in the SINE/DIME

survey are averaged over several different calendar periods. The first—
order autocorrelations of earnings and hours are similar in all three

surveys. The covariances between contemporaneous changes in earnings
and hours, on the other hand, are relatively higher in the SINE/DINE.
This implies that the simple regression coefficient of changes in the
logarithxo of annual hours on changes in the logarithm of average hourly

earnings is smaller in absolute value in the SINE/DINE (—.17) than in

the other surveys (—.31 in the PSID and —.32 in the NLS). None of the
third—order autocovariances or cross—covariances is statistically
significant in Table 6, suggesting that semi—annual changes in log
earnings and log hours in the SINE/DIME are close to a bivariate MA(2)

process. Since a bivariate MA(2) representation of semi—annual changes
in earnings and hours implies only a first—order moving average representation of annual changes, the SINE/DIME data exhibit lower order
serial correlation than the PSID data.
Tables 7, 8, and 9 present formal test statistics for several
restrictive models of the covariance matrices of earnings and hours from

the three samples. Details of the method—of—moments estimation frame—

—9—

work that we use to obtain these test statistics are presented in

Appendix A. Table 7 presents the test results for the PSID sample. The
first rw of the Table reports the goodness—of—fit statistic for a
nonstationary bivariate MA(2) representation of the PSID data. This is
a test that the third and higher—order autocovariances and cross—
covariances
of

in Table 4-are

jointly equal to zero. The probability value

the test statistic is about six percent. Given the absence of

any

large or individually significant covariances of third order or higher,
we conclude that a second order moving average provides an adequate

representation of changes in earnings and hours in the PSID sample.
The next three rows of Table 7 present goodness—of—fit statistics

associated

with further restrictions on the general MA(2) model. These

tests are performed on the subset of autocovariances and cross—
covariances up to second order, utilizing the sample variance matrix of
the selected covariances..!Q! The first test is for a symmetric MA(2)

model of earnings and hours. This model imposes symmetry on the block

a marginal significance level of 2 percent, indicating

some evidence against the symmetry hypothesis. The next test statistic
reported in Table 7 is a test for an MA(l) representation of earnings

and hours changes in the P519. Against the MA(2) alternative, this is a
test that the second—order autocovariances and cross—covariances

in

4 are jointly equal to zero. Again, the test statistic indicates

some evidence against the null hypothesis. The final row of Table 7
presents the test statistic for the hypothesis that the covariance

—10—

structure of earnings and hours changes is time—stationary (i.e. ,

that

all 10 variances of earnings are equal, that all 10 variances of hours

are equal, etc.). This hypothesis is strongly rejected by the data.
Tables 8 and 9 present an identical sequence of test statistics for
the NLS and SIME/DIME samples.

In both samples, the data are consistent

with a bivariate MA(2) representation of earnings and hours changes. In
the NLS, the second—order covariances and cross—covariances of earnings

and hours are also approximately equal to zero. Like the PSUD, the
SIME/DThIE and NLS covariances exhibit significant nonstationarity. The
SIME/DIME and NLS covariance matrices are more nearly consistent with
the symmetry restriction than the PSID covariance matrix.

In light of the data presented in Tables 4—6, and the test results
in Tables 7—9, we conclude that changes in individual earnings and hours
are adequately summarized as a nonstationary bivariate second—order

moving average. This description holds for annual data (PSID), semiannual data (SIME/DIME), and annual data at two year gaps (NLS). More
restrictive models of the covariance structure of earnings and hours
changes are not generally valid.

In particular, nonstationarity is an

important feature of the covariances of earnings and hours from all
three panel surveys.

II. Alternative Models of the Covariance Structure of Earnings
and Hours thanges
In this section we present a simplified life—cycle labor supply

model and derive its implications for the covariance matrix of changes
in

earnings and

hours in panel data. We also present an alternative

models

in the presence of survey measurement error and outline an esti—

strategy that decomposes changes in earnings and hours into two

components: a systematic component, reflecting individual productivity
(in the labor supply model) or employer demand (in the contract nvdel);
and a measurement error component.

Changes in earnings and hours share common components associated with

the

leisure; and the difference between the discount rate and real

enters the equations for earnings and hours changes with relative factor
loadings of (1-i-n) and n , respectively.
To complete this model of earnings and hours, we need to specify a
stochastic process for the wage rate. We assume that individual wages
contain a permanent component, an aggregate component, an experience—

related component, and an idiosyncratic component. Specifically, we

We defer a detailed discussion of these assumptions to Appendix B.

The change in tastes for leisure is therefore a first—order moving
average with a serial correlation coefficient of —.50.

The measurement errors u and v'

have a special structure.

They are intended to represent systematic and random deviations of the
survey measures of earnings and hours from their theoretical analogues.

To capture these ideas, we assume that

We assume that c1

the changes in the measurement errors of earnings and hours reflect only
the changes in the transitory components of these errors, and since the

transitory

measurinent errors are serially uncorrelated, Au* and v*

are first—order moving averages with serial correlation coefficients
equal to —

.50.

Notice that we are unable to separately identify the

variance contribution of the random shock to preferences and the
variance contribution of the transitory measurement errors, since we
have assumed that they have the same serial correlation properties, and

we have not

restricted the correlation between the measurement errors.

which is a stationary bivariate MA(l) process with an arbitrary

On the basis of the evidence that changes in earnings and hours are
adequately represented as a bivariate MA(2) process, we assume that

changes in individual productivity shocks in all three surveys follow a

nonstationary second order moving average. The parameters of this process include the variance of the change in individual productivity

shocks in period t (var Az.) , the covariance of changes in individual

productivity shocks in periods t and t—l (cov(Az. ,

Azj)),

and

the covariance of changes in individual productivity shocks in periods

The final corrrponent of variance in equations (12a) and (12b) is
the unexpected change in the logarithm of the marginal utility of
wealth.

We are now in a position to catalogue the implicationsof equations
(l2a) and (l2b) for the covariance structure of earnings and hours in

panel data. We note that in the absence of prior information these
equations place no restrictions on the mean changes in earnings and

hours observed in a cross—section)-! Depending on the specification of
life—cycle preferences for leisure, however, equations (12) may restrict
the

regression

coefficients of changes in earnings and hours on poten-

tial experience. Equation (iZa) implies that the regression coefficient

The hypothesis of

and strongly rejected in the NLS sample. In view of this finding, for

the

remainder of our empirical analysis we leave the regression coefficients of the changes in earnings and hours on potential experience

unrestricted, and concentrate on the covariance structure of the
experience—adjusted changes.

adjusted changes in earnings and hours consist of three

components: a productivity component (Azit) that enters earnings and

—21—

hours with coefficients (l+) and n , respectively;

a serially

uncorrelated component associated with the unanticipated change in the

marginal utility of income; and a restricted bivariate MA(l) component
reflecting survey measurement error and random shocks to preferences.
Table 11 summarizes the implications of equations (l7a) and (17b)
for the covariance structure of experience—adjusted changes in earnings
and

hours.

Measurement error components contribute negative first—order

autocovariances in direct proportion to their variance contribution.

Unanticipated changes in the marginal utility of income contribute a
time—specific component to the variances and

covariance

of earnings and

hwrs, but do not contribute to the autocovariances. Individual—
specific productivity shocks contribute a time—varying variance and
covariance component, and represent the only source of second—order

autocovariance. As indicated in the table, the labor supply model im-

choice of correlation coefficients. In this paper we do not compute
variance

decompositions of the earnings and hours data.

B. A Fixed Wage Contract Model.
The institutional structure of many

employment situations is not

easily reconciled with a model of the labor market in which employees

unilaterally determine their hours of work subject to their current
wage rate. In contrast, a wide variety of contractual models emphasize
fixity in the labor market and resulting discrepancies between observed
average hourly earnings and the marginal rate of substitution of consurnp—

tion for leisure)2_" A prototypical model is one outlined by Abowd and

Ashenfelter (1981). In their model, employers offer

job packages con-

sisting of a fixed average hourly wage rate and a probability distribu-

tion over hours. Equilibrium in the labor market is obtained by equating
expected
the

utilities of job packages.

changes in labor supply is zero: earnings move in direct

wage rates.

To derive the implications of this model for the covariances of
earnings and hours in panel data, assume that the wage rate received by

individual i in period t contains only a permanent component, a
deterministic experience component, and a period—specific component:

impossible to reject the labor supply model in favor of the fixed

close to unity, however, our interpretation of the data is not that
small changes in wage rates are necessarily driving large changes
in hours, but rather that hours and earnings are moving proportionately
at constant average hourly wage rates.--'

III. Estimates of a Two—Factor Model of Earnings and Hours.
In this section we present estimates of the two—factor model of

earnings and hours generation derived fran the theoretical models in the

previous section. We report estimation results for two versions of
the labor supply model: a perfect foresight version that ignores
changes in the marginal utility of income; and a stochastic version that

allas for unanticipated changes in the marginal utility of income. For
each version of the model, and each of the three panel surveys, we pre—

—26—

statistics

for the goodness—of—fit of the model, as well as

estimates of the relative contribution of productivity shocks in

earnings as compared to hours (the parameter p in equation (22a)), and
the implied elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

The estimates are obtained by method—of—moments techniquS, using
as data the covariances of experience—adjusted changes in earnings and

hairs. On the basis of the preliminary data analysis in Section I, we
fit the model to the contemporaneous covariances of earnings and hours

and their first—

and second—order

autocovariances, ignoring the higher—

order autocovariances.
Two

alternative

method—of--moments estimates are presented. The

first, whidi we call the equally weighted minimum distance (EW?e) estimator, minimizes the quadratic form
[m —

f(b)J'

[m —

f(b)]

where m represents the vector of adjusted covariances to be fit by the

model, b represents the vector of parameters of the model, and f(b)
represents the vector of predicted values of the fitted moments, con-

ditional on the parameter vector b •

The second, which we call the.

optimal minimum distance (Oft)) estimator, minimizes the quadratic form
[m -

f(b)J' V[m - f(b)]

where V denotes the sample variance matrix of the data vector

in.

Chamberlain (1984) shows that the latter estimator minimizes the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimated parameters among the class of
minimum distance estimators.
Table 12 sunmarizes the structural estimation results for the PSID.

—27—

Columns (1) and (2) report equally weighted minimum distance and
optimal
minimum distance estimates, respectively, for the perfect foresight
model, while columns (3) and (4) report EWFID and 01W

estimates of the

uncertainty model. The individual productivity process

(Az1) is

estimated as an arbitrary nonstationary MA(2) process. In the PSID,

this introduces 27 parameters: 10 variances, 9 first—order covariances,
and 8 second—order covariances. The measurement error/preference shock
component of variance introduces 3 additional parameters (the variance
of the measurement error component in earnings, the variance of the
measurement error component in hours, and the correlation of the two

measurement errors). The final structural parameter is the relative
contrihitlon of the productivity component to earnings

(1').

In the

uncertainty specification of the model there are 20 additional para-

meters corresponding to the additional unrestricted zero—order covar—

lances. Since the measurement error components and the productivity
components are not separately identifiable, for purposes of estimation
we have arbitrarily fixed the correlation of the measurement errors in

and hours. The goodness—of—fit of the models and the estimates

suggest

that the perfect foresight model is not supported by the data.

The test statistics in the last two columns of the Table, on the other
hand, indicate that the uncertainty model is consistent with the data at

though the perfect foresight model does not fit well, the estimates of

The finding that productivity shocks influence earnings and hours

proportionately

suggests that systematic changes in individual hours

occur at fixed hourly wage rates. There are a variety of possible

interpretations of this finding. One possibility is that changes in
hcnrs

are determined by employer preferences, and are uncorrelated with

changes in average hourly earnings. A second possibility is that the

estimate of p

is biased downward by changes in the marginal utility of

.

Year—to—year changes in earnings and hours are consistent with

either a large substitution elasticity, or alternatively with employer
determined hours at fixed average hourly wage rates.

The results in Table 12 nonetheless reveal a problem for the fixed—

wage interpretation of the estimates of p .

Under a stochastic labor

supply model, the contemporaneous covariances of earnings and hours are

not necessarily consistent with a two—factor model. Under the simple
contract model outlined in Section 118, on the other hand, the zero—
order covariances of earnings and hours are consistent with the same

two—factor model as the higher—order autocovariances. The

underlying

goodness—of--fit statistics for the two—factor model when the contemporaneous

covariances are restricted (in columns (I) and (2)) and

unrestricted

(in columns (3) and (4)) suggest that this is not the case.

Whether the contanporaneous covariances of earnings and hours are

restricted by the model or not, the estimate of p and the
corresponding goodness—of—fit statistics are very similar between the
OMD and EWMD estimation methods. Differences between the OMD and EWMD

parameter estimates have the interpretation of a specification test
(Hausman (1978)). Under the hypothesis that the model is correctly specified, both the EWHD and OMD estimates are consistent, and the OND

estimates are efficient. It is straightforward to show that the
covariance
parameter

matrix of the vector of differences between the EWMD and 01W
estimates is equal to the difference between the OMD

parameter

covariance matrix and the EWMO parameter covariance matrix.--' The test
statistics associated with the difference between the 01W and EWMD esti—

—30—

mates of p are reported in the fourth row

of

the Table. For both the

perfect foresight and uncertainty versions of the labor supply model,

the OMD and EWMD estimates of j

are

not significantly different.

Table 13 summarizes the estimation results for the NLS. In fitting
the labor supply model to the NLS, the covariances of the underlying

productivity shock (Az.) contribute 12 free parameters (five variances, four first—order autocovariances, and three second—order

autocovariances). Columns (1) and (2) of the table present estimation
results for the perfect foresight version of the labor supply model.
Columns (3) and (4) contain the results for the stochastic labor supply
model, which adds 10 extra parameters corresponding to the additional
unrestricted zero—order covariances.
The equally weighted minimum distance estimates in columns (1) and

(3) suggest that the parameter i

is

greater than unity, but not

significantly so. The associated estimates of

ii

are large and Impre-

cise. The goodness—of—fit of the perfect foresight model is poor: the
chi—squared test statistic is 124.1 with 28 degrees of freedom. The fit
of the stochastic labor supply model, on the other hand, is considerably

better. The optimal minimum distance estimates in columns (2) and (4)
of Table 13 provide about the same goodness—of—fit as the corresponding

EWMD estimates, but yield very different estimates of the labor
supply elasticity. The (ThD estimates of the perfect foresight model, in
particular,

earnings

indicate a remarkably stronger productivity component in

as compared to hours, and a relatively small estimate of i

The OMD estimates of the stochastic labor supply model
are closer to the

—31—

corresponding equally weighted minimum distance estimates, but yield a
negative point estimate of

ii.

Our interpretation of the difference in the estimates in columns (1)

and (2) of Table 12 is that the perfect foresight labor supply model provides a poor fit to the data, and as a consequence the parameter estimates are sensitive to the relative weight assigned to the deviations of

particular moments from their predicted values. The fourth row of Table
4 presents specification tests based on the difference between the EWND

estimates of p and the corresponding OND estimates. For the perfect
foresight model the statistic cannot be computed because the estimated

standard error under OMD is larger than under EWMD.?' In any case, the
goodness—of—fit statistics providefairly strong evidence against the

perfect foresight labor supply model. For the uncertainty model, on the

other hand, the difference in the EWMD and OMP estimates of p is .71,
with a standard error of .51. This result and the goodness—of—fit statistics in the third and fourth columns of the Table suggest that the
stochastic labor supply model provides a reasonable description of the
data.

Table 14 contains goodness—of—fit statistics and parameter esti-

mates obtained from the SIME/DIME sample. The conclusions from this
sample are essentially the same as the conclusions from the other data

sets. The perfect foresight labor supply model fits relatively poorly.
The alternative model that frees up the zero—order covariances of the

data is only marginally rejected. The estimates of p are within
sampling error of unity in all cases. In the SIME/DII{E data, as in the
PSID data, the specification tests based on the difference between the

—32—

EWMD and aMP

estimates of p are not significant at conventional signi-

ficance levels.

IV. Conclusions
We have presented evidence on the autocovariance structure of ear-

nings and hours changes in three panel data sets: the PSID, which
measures hours and earnings annually; the NLS Survey of Older Men, which
measures annual hours and earnings at two year intervals; and the

SIME/DIME, which measures semi—annual earnings and hours. In spite of
these timing differences, and some differences across the surveys in the
questionnaire used to measure hours and earnings, the autocovariance

structure of all three data sets is remarkably similar. Individual
changes in earnings and hours have strong negative first order auto—
correlation, weak second order autocorrelation, and negligible higher

order autocorrelations. Contemporaneous changes in earnings and hours
are positively correlated in all three data sets. This cross—covariance
is too small, however, to generate a position covariance between changes
in hours and changes in average hourly earnings in any of the data sets.
The sparse autocovariance structure of earnings and hours changes
makes it difficult to identify models that include general specifications of measurement error, tastes, and
two

economic components. We develop

models of hours and earnings that distinguish between an unsystema-

tic component (attributable to measurement error and/or taste changes),

and a systematic component. In the first model, the systematic component is interpreted as an underlying shock to individual productivity

—33—

that

influences wages directly and hours indirectly through an intertem—

poral substitution effect. In the second model, the systematic component is interpreted as a shock to employer demand for hours that
influences

results

earnings and hours equi—proportionately. Our empirical

suggest

that the systematic component of variance effects ear-

nings and hours equi—pifoportionately in all three panel data sets.

Apart from the zero—order covariances of earnings and hours (the
variances of earnings and hours and their contemporaneous covariance), a
simple two—factor model provides an adequate description of the
covariance structure of earnings and hours changes in all three data

sets. A two—factor model is apparently too restrictive as a model of
the complete covariance matrix of earnings and hours changes. In the
context of a labor supply model, this finding is interpreted as evidence

against perfect—foresight. In the context of a fixed—wage contract

model the interpretation of this finding is unclear. More work is
required to distinguish between the two models, and to develop alternative models of the covariance structure of earnings and hours.

negative correlation between changes

in hours and changes in average

hourly earnings.

Appendix A

In this appendix we summarize the estimation and -inference proce-

-

dures used throughcxit the paper. The basic unit of data for each individual in a particular data set is the vector of experience—adjusted
changes in earnings and hours. If we denote these by A log

and

A log hj , then the data vector is

represent

the mean vector of changes and

represent the covariance matrix of

in Tables 4, 5, and 6.

The

models we estimate are models for C.

Let m represent a

vector whose elements are the distinct elements of C •

Since C is

symntric, there are only 2T(2T-i-l)/2 elements in in •

In

the PSID,

this corresponds to 210 elements; in the NLS, 55 elements, and itt

SIME/DD4E, 136. Conformably with in,

let

m represent the distinct

elements of the individual cross—products matrix

Under fairly general conditions, independence of the

that the sample mean of

where p

m has an asymptotic normal distribution:

N(O ,

V*)

is the population value of m (i.e. , the true covariance

matrix of earnings and hours changes) and V* is the population value

of V.
Consider a model for the vector of covariance elements that depends
on a lcwyer—djmensional parameter vector b

,

say

m =

f(b).

Several

—43—

estimators

are available for b: among these are the optimal minimum

distance (OIID) estimator b° , which minimizes (m—f(b)) V1 (m—f(b)),
and

the

equally weighted minimum distance (EWMD) (or least squares)

estimator
former

be , which minimizes (m—f(b) ) '(m—f(b)).

Optlinality of the

estimator is discussed in Chamberlain (1984).

For the OMU estimator, inference is based on the fact that under the
hypothesis of a correct

N •

(in

—

specification, the minimized

f(b°fl'

V1 (m —

f(b°))

has an asymptotic chi—squared distribution with

to

quadratic form

degrees of freedom equal

the difference between the dimension of m and the rank of the

Jacobian

evaluated at b* ,

matrix F(b)

the

true value of b.

(See Chamberlain (1984)).

If the model for in

has

= f(b)

=

H
in which

the special form

only the last k elements of

N•

are restricted to zero, it is

to show that the minimized quadratic form reduces to

V22

m2

where V22 is the block of V

corresponding

to the elements in

that are restricted to zero. This is the chi—squared test for

=0

in

—44--

For an estimator bA that minimizes an arbitrary quadratic form
(m —

f(bfl'

ACm —

f(b))

where A is a positive definite matrix, Newey (1985) shows that the
quadratic form
(in

- f(b R (mS- f(bA))

has an asymptotic chi—squared distribution. Here, C is a generalized
inverse of the matrix R = pVp'

,

where

— F(F'F)1

p =

F'A , and

F

represents the Jacobian matrix of f evaluated at hA. Newey (1985)

suggests a generalized inverse of R of the form S(S'RS)1 S , where
S is a selection matrix of rank equal to the difference between the
dimension of

in

(the number of movements fit) and the rank of F. In

general, for a nonlinear model, the value of the quadratic form depends

the exact generalized inverse selected for R. In case of a linear

on

model, however,

the value of the quadratic form is invariant, and in the

simple case of testing the restrictions in2

restrictions on m1 ,

equal N

the

0

,

with

no additional

value of the quadratic form can be shown to

in2' V221 in2. Tests of zero restrictions are invariant to

the choice of OMD or any arbitrary minimum distance estimator.
Our procedure is to first test for zero restrictions and then to

work with the nonzero covariances of earnings and hours. In the notation of the previous discussion, once we have accepted the hypothesis
= 0

V11

,

we estimate ndels for

m1 and use

the covariances matrix

for inference. This procedure is not fully efficient, since

better estimates of the unrestricted elements of m can be formed by
taking into

those

account the fact that certain other elements of at (i.e.
are zero.

Appendix B

In this appendix, we comnnt on the assumption underlying equation
(10) of the text that aggregate shocks and experience effects enter
homogeneously into individual

productivity. More

generally, consider

the alternative specification:

(ba) log

a1 + r16

+

+2x +

z

Here, we have permitted the aggregate productivity shock
individual

ficient
that

r1

to affect

productivity through an individual—specific response coefCross—section

dispersion in r

reflects

the possibility

individuals have permanent cyclical attributes: individuals with

higher values of r1 are more responsive to aggregate shocks. We have
also permitted the linear experience coefficient

to have an indi-

vidual component of variance.

Equation (l0a) implies that the first difference of wages can be
written as:

(ha) A log

where

K

= rA6

—

=

K+

+ 2y2t

+ Y2x0
,

and

+

(r —r) Aót + Az1

r is the average value of

Individual heterogeniety in the experience slope and the response to
aggregate shocks introduces two additional components of variance into

the first differences of earnings and hours. Both of these components
contribute to covariances between lagged changes in earnings and hours.

First consider the component of variance associated with (r — r)

If

this component is large, then changes in earnings and hours in years
with a negative product [vity shock should be more highly

correlated with

—46—

changes in other years with negative shocks, and less correlated with

changes in years with aggregate productivity improvements. By most
measures aggregate productivity fell with business cycle recessions in

1969—70, 1973—74, and 1980—81. In the PSID data, however, covariances
of earnings and hours changes between these years are very similar to
covariances

between arbitrary pairs of years at the same gap. We there-

fore conclude that the component of variance due to individual—specific

responses to aggregate shocks is small.
Next, consider the component of variance in (ha) associated with
cross—section dispersion in earnings growth rates. This component
contrihites

a fixed positive element to earnings and hjrs autocovar—

iances and cross—covariances of all orders. In

the data, autocovariances

of third order and higher are all negligible. Again, we conclude that
cross—section

dispersion in experience growth rates contrihites a

relatively small component of variance to wage growth.
