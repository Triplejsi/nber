Price Volatility

ABSTPACT

This paper establishes an inequality that may be used to test the null
hypothesis that a stock price equals the expected present discounted value of
its dividend stream, with a constant discount rate. The inequality states that
if this hypothesis is true, the variance of the innovation in the stock price
is bounded above by a certain function of the variance in the innovation in the
dividend. The bound is valid even if' prices and dividends are nonstationary.

The inequality is used to test the null hypothesis, for some long term
annual U.S. stock price data. The null is decisively rejected, with the stock
price innovation variance exceeding its theoretical upper bound by a factor of

as much as twenty.

The rejection is highly significant statistically.

Regression diagnostics and some informal analysis suggest that the results are
more consistent with there being speculative bubbles in the U.S. stock market

than with a failure of the rational expectations or constant discount rate
hypothesis.

The source of fluctuations in stock prices has long been argued. Some
observers have suggested that a major part of the fluctuations result from self

fulfilling rumors about potential price fluctuations. In a famous passage,
Keynes, for example, described the stock market as a certain type of beauty
contest in which judges try to guess the winner of the contest: speculators
devote

their "intelligence to anticipating what average opinion expects average

opinion

to be" [15, p136:1. An examination of practically any modern finance

text (e.g., Brealey and Myers [5]) indicates that the economics profession
tends to hold the opposite view. Stock price fluctuations are argued to result
solely from changes in the expected present discounted value of dividends.

The subject has received increased attention in recent years because of the

volatility tests of Leroy and Porter [21] and, especially, Shiller [33]. These
tests seem to indicate that stock price fluctuations are too large to result

solely from changes in the expected present discounted value (PDV) of
dividends. There is, however, some question as to the validity of this
conclusion. Marsh and Merton [214,25] have objected to the tests' assumption
that dividends are stationary around a time trend; Flavin [8] and Kleidon [20]

have argued that in small samples the tests are biased toward finding excess
volatility.

This paper develops and applies a stock market volatility test that is not

subject to these criticisms,

The test is based on an inequality on the

variance of the innovation in the expected PDV of a given stock's dividend
stream, and was first suggested by Blanchard and Watson [14],2 The

inequality

states that if discount rates are constant this variance is larger when
expectations are conditional on just the set of current and past dividends than

when expectations are conditional on a larger information set. It may be shown

that this implies that the variance of the innovation in a stock price is

—2—
bounded above by a certain function of the variance of the innovation in the
corresponding dividend.

The paper checks whether the bound is satisfied by some long term annual

data on the S and P 500 and the Dow Jones indices. It is not. The estimated

variance of the stock price innovation is about four to twenty times its
theoretical upper bound.

The violation of the inequality is in all cases

highly statistically significant.

It is to be emphasized that the inequality is valid even when prices and
dividends are integrated ARIMA

process

with infinite variances, and that the

empirical work allows for such nonstationarity.

In addition, the test

procedure does not require calculation of a perfect foresight price; this price
appears to be central to the small sample biases that are argued by Flavin [8]

and Kleidon [20] to plague the Shiller [33] volatility test.

The paper

nonetheless performs a small Monte Carlo experiment to check whether under

certain simple circumstances the small sample bias in this paper's test
procedure could explain the results of the test. The answer is no.
While one of the purposes of this paper is to apply a volatility test with

a relatively weak set of maintained statistical assumptions, that is not its

only aim. It also considers the consistency of some of the test's maintained
economic assumptions with the data, to help determine which among these should

be relaxed, so that the excess price volatility might be explained. To that
end, the paper uses a battery of formal diagnostic tests on the regressions

that must be estimated to calculate the inequality. The test results are in
general quite consistent with the test's maintained hypotheses of rational
expectations and, perhaps suprisingly, of a constant rate f or discounting
future dividends.

Some additional, less formal analysis, which considers

further the constant discount rate hypothesis, does not suggest that

the

—3—

excessive price variability results solely from

variation

in discount rates.

The test maintains essentially only one additional assumption, which is a
transversality condition that puts an upper bound on expected growth in stock

prices. If this condition is false, the excess volatility might be due to
speculative bubbles of the sort considered by, f or example, Blanchard and
Watson [14].

The evidence, then, is more consistent with a failure of the transversality

condition than of the rational expectations or constant discount rate
assumptions. The paper does not, however, attempt to make a detailed case for

bubbles, or, f or that matter, any other factor, as the explanation of the
excess volatility. Instead what is emphasized are two empirical regularities

that seem to characterize the data studied here. The first is that prices
appear to be too variable to be set as the expected PDV of dividends, with a

constant discount rate; this holds even if prices and dividends are

nonstationary.

The second is that a rational expectations, constant discount

rate model appears to characterize these data remarkably well. Reconciliation
of these two points is a task left for future research.

Before turning to the details of the subject at hand, a final introductory

remark seems worth making. The inequality established here may be of general
interest in that it could be used to test other infinite horizon present value

models, Possible examples include testing whether consumption is too variable
to be consistent with the permanent income hypothesis (a subject considered in
Deaton [6]), or whether exchange rates are too variable to be consistent with a
standard monetary model (West [140]).

That the inequality is valid even in a

nonstationary environment makes it particularly appealing in these and perhaps
other contexts.

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section II establishes the basic

—14—

inequality. Section III explains how the inequality may be used to test a
rational expectations, constant discount rate stock price model. Section IV
presents formal econometric results. Section V considers informally whether
small sample bias or discount rate variation are likely to explain the section

IV results. Section VI has conclusions. An appendix has econometric details.

II.The Basic Inequality
The following proposition is the basis of this paper.

Proposition 1: Let t be an information set consisting of the space spanned by

the current and past values of a finite number of random variables. After
suitable differencing, the random variables are assumed to be covariarice
stationary, and, without loss of generality, to have zero mean. Let dt be one

of these variables. Let Ht be a subset of 't consisting of the space spanned
by current and past values of some subset of the variables In I, Including at

a minimum current and past values of dt. Let b be a positive constant, Ob<1.

The second equality follows since Xt_xti=xtExtIIt is uncorrelated with

serially

uncorrelated.

A verbal restatement of Proposition 1 is as follows.

Suppose we are

forecasting the present discounted value of dt, by calculating XtI and XtH.

Each period as new data become available we revise our forecast.
E(xtl_ExtIIIt_l)2 and E(xtH_EXtHIHt_1)2 are measures of the average size of
this period to period revision. Proposition 1 says that with less information
the size of the revision tends to be larger. That is, when less information is

—6—

used,

the variance of the innovation in the expected present discounted value

of dt is larger.

It is worth making four comments on the conditions under which (1) is
valid. Further details on some of the comments may be found in footnote 1L

determined

by the arbitrage relationship (9) (Brealey and Myers

Proposition 1 is used to test the model (12) as follows. Note first that

If the estimate of (16) is negative (that is,

When (16) is negative, (17) yields a number between 0 and 100.

refer to this somewhat loosely as the percentage of the variance of the
innovation in Pt that is excessive. This is of course somewhat imprecise in

that b2q2 is the variance of the innovation in the sum of dividends and
prices.

But given that price innovations are much larger than dividend

Innovations (see the empirical results below), this terminology does not seem
misleading.7

What alternatives might

explain

a rejection of the null hypothesis that

(16) is positive? Three have figured prominently in discussions of related
work:

expectational irrationality (e.g., Ackley [1]), variation in discount

rates (e.g., Leroy [22]) and speculative bubbles (e.g., Blanchard and Watson
[ii]). Elaboration of the relevant implications for asset price variability of

the first two seems unnecessary since these are well known from the work of
Shiller [33,314,35].

Let us begin by noting that Pt=EbJdt+IIt is not the only solution to (1).
If the transversality condition (11) fails, there is a family of solutions to

(1) (Blanchard and Watson [14], Shiller [32], Taylor [36]). For any c, that

satisfies ECtIIt_ibct 1' PtEZb3dt+IIt+ct is also a solution to (1). c is
by definition a speculative bubble, an otherwise extraneous event that affects

stock prices because everyone expects it to do so. An example of a stochastic
process for c, similar to one described in Blanchard and Watson [MI, is

bubble is positively correlated with the innovation in x1. This will be the
case

if for

example, the bubble is connected with fundamentals and reflects

a

tendency of the market to overreact to news about dividends. This is sometimes
argued

to be plausible (e.g., Blanchard and Watson [J43).8

In the presence

of bubbles, then, b2a2 will plausibly be bigger than

E(xti_ExtilIt_i)2, and, therefore, (16) will be positive. In light of some

empirical evidence yet to be presented, it is of particular interest to
consider how to distinguish between bubbles on the one hand and expectational

irrationality and time varying discount rates on the other as possible
explanations of any excess price volatility. Formal econometric tests will
help here. Consider, for example, diagnostic tests on the residual to equation
(lii). As long as (9) is correct——which it will be if expectations are rational

and the discount rate is constant, even if there are bubbles—-u+1, the
disturbance to (114), is an expectational error. So u÷1 should be serially
uncorrelated and uncorrelated with anything In I, including, in particular,

lagged dividends. But if expectations are not rational,

will not in

general have these properties. Nor will it if discount rates vary through time
(see footnote 12).

Other diagnostics may also help distinguish between bubbles and other
alternatives as possible explanations;

some of

these were calculated and are

—13—

described in the next section. For the present, the important point to note is

that when bubbles are absent, the arbitrage equation (1k) and the dividend
equation (15) together imply that (16) is positive. The only apparent form of'

misspecification that leaves (1) and (15) legitimate, but is still consistent
with (16) being negative, is speculative bubbles. So an essential part of the

strategy used here to distinguish between bubbles and other alternatives as
explanations of excessive price variability is to perform diagnostic tests on

equations (1k) and (15).

If these appear to be well specified, a logical

inference is that bubbles explain the excess volatility.9

Such an inference may of course be incorrect. There may be small sample
biases in the diagnostic tests. In addition, one may have a strong theoretical
presumption that speculative bubbles are not present, or that the basic model

has been misspecified in that, say, discount rates vary through time: it is
certainly true that a consensus view on how general are the equilibria that

admit bubbles is far from established, and that intertemporal asset pricing

theories suggest that discount rates vary in general.'1° It would then be
reasonable to give little credence to formal econometric evidence based on
asymptotic distributions.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider these points in great
detail.

Section V does, however, analyze informally some of them.

IV. Empirical Results.
A. Data and Estimation Technique.
The data used were those used by Shiller [33 in his study of stock
price volatility, and were graciously supplied by him. There were two
data sets, both containing annual aggregate price and dividend data. One
had the Standard and Poor 500 for 1871-1980

=

price

in January

divided by producer price index (1979 = 100), dt+l = sum of dividends
from that same January to the following December, deflated by the average

of that yearts producer price index). The other data set was a modified

Dow Jones index, 19281978 (p,d+i as above). See Shiller [33 for a
discussion of the data.
The following aspects of estimation are discussed in turn:

(i) selection of the dividend processts lag length q ,

(ii)

estimation

of (14), (15) and (16), (iii) calculation of the variance-covariance
matrix of the parameters estimated, and (iv) diagnostic tests performed.

(1) It was assumed that the univariate dt process required at most one

difference to induce stationarity. That is, in equation (15), s0 (the
original series used) or s1 (first difference of original series used).

No other values of s were tried.
For both the differenced and undifferenced versions of each data

set's dividend process, two values of lag length q were used. One was

arbitrarily selected as q4. The other was the q selected by the
information criterion of Hannan and Quinn [14]. This criterion chooses

the value of q that minimizes a certain function of the estimated
parameters, and asymptotically chooses the correct q if the process
truly has a finite order autoregressive representation.'1

-15-

Thus, for each data set up to four sets of parameter estimates were

calculated: q4, qlag length selected by the information criterion,
for differenced and undifferenced series. In one case (Dow Jones,

differenced), the Hannan and Quinn [14] criterion chose q4. So only
three sets of parameters were calculated for Dow Jones.

(ii) Calculation of (16) required estimation of the bivariate system
consisting equations (14) and (15). Equation (14) was estimated by
Hansen's [is] and Hansen and Singleton's [18] twostep two-stage least

squares. The first step was standard two stage least squares. The
second step obtained the optimal instrumental variables estimator. The
q+1 instruments used were the variables on the right hand side of (15),

i.e., a constant term and q lags of 5d (s0 or s1). Equation
(15) was estimated by OLS, with the covariance matrix of the parameter
estimates adjusted for conditional heteroscedasticity as described in
(iii).

standard error on the estimate of equation (16) was calculated as

[(af/ao)V(af/ao)']1"2 (See Rao [29, pp. 385-86].) The derivatives of f
were calculated analytically.

(iii) The estimate of V, the variance-covariance matrix of 0, was
calculated by the methods of Hansen [is] and White and Domowitz [42] so
that the estimate would be consistent for an arbitrary ARNA process for

and v. This is necessary because, for example, the correlation

between u and

may in principle be nonzero for all j > 0 .

The

Newey and West [271 procedure was used to insure that V was positive
definite. Details may be found in the appendix. It suffices to note
here that the procedure for calculating the standard error on (16)
properly accounts for the uncertainty in the estimates of both the
regression parameters and the variances of the residuals.

(iv) The final item discussed before results are presented is diagnostic

tests on equations (14) and (15). Four diagnostic checks were performed.

—17—

The first checked for serial correlation in the residuals to the

equations, using a pair of tests. As noted above, u1, the disturbance
to equation (14), is an expectational error. If expectations are
rational, then,

will be serially uncorrelated. Equation (15)'s

disturbance v1 should also be serially uncorrelated, since

v1 is

the innovation to the dividend process.

The first of the pair of serial correlation tests checked for first

order serial correlation in u1 and v1. This was done as suggested
in Pagan and Hall [28, pp. 191, 170]. The second of the pair of serial
correlation tests, performed only for (15), calculated the Box-Pierce Q

statistic for the residuals. This statistic of course simultaneously
tests for first and higher order serial correlation, see Granger and
Newbold [10, p. 93].

The second of the four diagnostic checks was performed only on

equation (14). This was a test of instrument-residual orthogonality,
basically checking whether the residual to (14) is uncorrelated with

lagged dividends (Hansen and Singleton [18}). Let Z be the ((q+1) x 1)

vector of instruments and b the estimate of b. The orthogonality test
is computed as:

(21) ( Z[p-b(p+1+ d+1)]) (TS)1 ( Z[p-b(p÷i+ d+i)J)

is an estimate of E(Ztut+i) (Zu+i) and was calculated as

the 2SLS residual to (14). The statistic (21) is asymptotically
distributed as a chi-squared random variable with q degrees of freedom.
As explained in a footnote, this test in general has the power to detect

—18—

failures of the model (12) such as expectational irrationality and
variation in discount rates.12
The third of the four diagnostic checks tested for the stability of

the regression coefficients in (14) and (15). Each sample was split in
half, a pair of regression estimates was obtained, and equality of the

pair was tested. The resulting statistic is asymptotically chi-squared,
with one degree of freedom for (14) and (q+1) degrees of freedom for

(15). This test clearly has the power to detect shifts in the discount
rate, as well as in the dividend process.

The fourth and final diagnostic check performed is implicit in the

estimation procedure described above. A variety of specifications for
the dividend process were used--differenced and undifferenced, with a

variety of lag lengths. Since the results did not prove sensitive to the
specification of the dividend process, the likelihood is relatively small
that changes in the specification of the dividend process will affect the
results.

B. Empirical Results.
Regression results for (14) and (15) are reported in Tables IA and

lB. The results in Table IA strongly suggest that the basic arbitrage
equation (1) is a sensible one. The entries in column (4) allow
comfortable acceptance of the null hypothesis of no serial correlation in

the disturbance to equation (14). The test statistic in all cases
is far from significant at the .05 level. In addition, the equation (19)
test for instrument-residual orthogonality also allows easy acceptance of
the null hypothesis of no correlation between the instruments and the

residuals. A possible exception is the Standard and Poor's data set,

—19—

undifferenced, lag length = 2.

See column (5). The generally successful

results in column (5) are perhaps especially noteworthy since failures of
rational expectations models to pass this test are quite common (e.g.,
Hansen and Singleton [18], West [38]).

Most important, the discount rate b is estimated plausibly and

extremely precisely in all regressions. See column (3). The implied
annual real interest rates are about six to seven per cent. These rates
are quite near the arithmetic means for ex post returns: 8.1 percent for
the Standard and Poor's index (1872—1981) and 7.4 per cent for the Dow

Jones index (1929-1979). The estimates of the discount rate therefore
are reasonable. The plausibility of the estimates of the discount rate
provide special reassurance that the specification of the arbitrage
equation (1) is an attractive one, since rational expectations models

often fail to estimate ex ante real rates either sensibly or precisely

(e.g., Blanchard [3], Rotemberg [30], Sargent [31]). Moreover, there is
little evidence that the rate was different in the two halves of either

sample. As indicated in column (6), the null hypothesis of equality
cannot be rejected at the five per cent level for any specification

except Standard and Poors, undifferenced, q=2. In addition, no evidence
against the constancy of the discount rate may be found in a comparison

of the two halves' mean ex post returns. For the Standard and Poor's
index, these were (in per cent) 8.09 (1872-1926) versus 8.12 (1927-1981);
for the Dow Jones the figures are 7.87 (1929-1954) versus 6.92
(1955—1979).

In general, then, the specification of the arbitrage equation (14)

seems quite attractive, with the possible exception of the Standard and

Poor's data set with dividends undifferenced. Let us now turn to the

-20-

estimates for the dividend process, reported in Table lB. Once again,
the entries in columns (8) and (9) allow comfortable acceptance of the
null hypothesis of no serial correlation in the disturbance to equation

(15). With one exception, both test statistics in all regressions are

far from significant. The only exception was the estimate of the first
order serial correlation coefficient p for the Standard and Poor's index,

undifferenced, lag length q=2. Note, however, that this regression's Q
statistic in column (9) comfortably accepts the null hypothesis of no

serial correlation. Overall, then, no serial correlation to the residual

to (15) is apparent. Also, the estimates of most regression coefficients
are fairly precise, at least when the lag length q was chosen by the

Bannan and Quinn [14] procedure. Finally, the null hypothesis that the
parameters of the dividend process are the same in the two halves of each
sample cannot be rejected for any specification except the Standard and

Poor's, undifferenced. See column (10). Overall, then, the
specification of the dividend process seems quite acceptable, again with
the possible exception of the Standard and Poor's data set,
undifferenced.

The null hypothesis that price is the expected present discounted
value of dividends, with a constant discount rate, does not, however,

appear acceptable, for any specification. As may be seen from column (7)
in Table II, equation (16) was always negative, and significantly so.
The asymptotic z-stat (ratio of parameter to asymptotic standard error)

was always larger than 2.5. This means that the column (7) entries are
always significant at the one-half per cent level, using a one-tailed

test. The null hypothesis may therefore be rejected at traditional
significance levels. Furthermore, the fraction of the variance of the

—21—
price innovation that is excessive is substantial, about 80 to 95 percent
(column (8) of Table II).

The residual price fluctuation might reflect irrational reaction to
news about dividends, variation in discount rates, or some combination of

these and other factors. For the S and P undifferenced
specifications, the econometric evidence is not particularly helpful in

discriminating among these possibilities. It is worth noting, however,
that for the other specifications, the results of the diagnostic tests

were more consistent with the residual volatility being due to
speculative bubbles than to a misspecification of the arbitrage or
dividend equations.

V.Sorne Additional Analysis

This section considers the possibilities that the previous section's
results are due to (A) small sample bias, or (B)variation in discount rates.
It is to be emphasized that the analysis is informal, and the conclusions are

far

from definitive.

The goal here is simply to gather some evidence on

whether either possibility explains the results; a complete, rigorous
econometric examination of either possibility would require a separate paper.
(A)Small Sample Bias

This section uses two small Monte Carlo experiments to get a feel for the

importance of two types of bias.

Part (1) below considers whether under

certain simple circumstances small sample bias is likely to account for the

finding of excess variability. Part (2) studies whether under equally simple
circumstances low small sample power of the equation (21) test of instrument
residual volatility is likely to explain the generally favorable results of the
diagnostic tests.

(1)It is important to consider whether small sample bias explains the finding
of excess variability, in light of the evidence in Kleidon [20] and Marsh and

Merton [25] suggesting that if prices and dividends are nonstationary, the
Shiller [33]

variance bounds test is strongly biased towards finding excess

variability. To see whether there is a similar bias in the present paper's
test, an environment similar to that in Kleidon [20] and Marsh and Merton [25]

was assumed. A Monte Carlo experiment was performed, assuming: (a)dividends

follow a random walk, Ldti+v, and (b)!-It=It, so that equations (16) and (17)
are zero.

In this experiment, i and

were matched to the S and P sample values of

the mean and variance of dt, i.i=.0373, o=.15714. b was set to .91113, the value

estimated in line 2 of Table IA. For each of 1000 samples, the following was

—23—

done:

of

100 independent normal shocks was drawn, (V1,...,V100)

were calculated as dt=.0373+vt;

dt=do+Zd5 (d0=1.3);

Pt=Z(.913)JEd+.II = m+61d, m=(.O373)*(.913)/(1_.913), 6i93/(1-.913).

u and a were then estimated by an OLS regression of dt on a constant, b and
by an instrumental variables regression of equation (1I), with a constant as

the only instrument. Finally, equation (17), the percentage of price

that is excessive, was calculated from the estimated parameters.
Table lilA presents the empirical distribution of equation (17). Ideally,

variability

the

median value of this statistic would be zero, with half the samples

yielding

a positive value to (17).

Instead it is 15.0, and

the samples produced a positive value. So there is a bias

about two thirds of

towards a finding of

excess variability. The bias is not, however, particularly marked, and fewer

10 percent of the simulated regressions produced the extreme values of the

than

sort found in all of the Table II specifications.
That the Table lilA distribution is only slightly biased suggests more
strongly than might be immediately apparent that small sample bias does not

explain the Table II results. For Table lilA contains worst case figures,
since it is based on simulations in which HtI. Proposition 1 implies that
for any given b and univariate dt process, a will be smaller when I contains
additional variables useful in forecasting dt than when It.=Ht. This suggests
that when It contains these variables estimates of
and of equation (17) will
be smaller as well. But a simulation with such variables in I, does not seem
worth undertaking, because even under worst case circumstances assumed here,

there is little to suggest that small sample bias explains the excess
variability reported in Table II.

(2)It is possible that the diagnostic tests reported basically favorable
results because the tests have low power.

It is particularly difficult to

consider this comprehensively, even if only one of the diagnostic tests is

potentially

analyzed. This is because Monte Carlo experiments here are
burdensome computationally.

quite

This will be true if Pt or dt are generated

nonlinearly under the alternative, as will be the case, f or example, in most
formulations of the Lucas [23] asset pricing model.

So this section has a relatively modest aim, of using a single diagnostic
test and a single, simple form of misspecfication, to suggest whether the data

sample size are such that the diagnostic tests are unlikely to detect
plausible misspecifications. The test that is used is the equation (21) test
and

of

instrument residual orthogonality. The misspecification that is assumed is

that expectations are static rather than rational, Edt+ lIt =

dt.

In such a

case, the disturbance to the arbitrage equation (14) is —b(pt+i+dt+i). So
the test must pick up a correlation between Pt+i+dt+i on the one hand and
lagged Adt (the instruments, assuming a differenced specification) on the
other. That the results of a simulation f or this alternative might produce
representative results is perhaps suggested by the fact that for just about any

alternative, the residual is some function, possibly nonlinear, of expected
and/or actual prices, dividends, and possibly, other variables. (See footnote
12.)

So to have power against plausible alternatives, the test will basiclly

have to be able to pick up a correlation between prices and dividends on the
one hand and lagged dt on the other, and, again, this is exactly what it must
do to have power against the static expectations alternative.

Under this alternative, Pt =

[b/(1—b)]dt;

b=.9413 was again assumed.

Dividends were assumed to be generated by an ARIMA(2,1,O) process, with the
parameters given by line (2) of Table lB. The following was done 1000 times.

A vector of 100 independent normal disturbances was generated, with the
variance of the disturbances equal to that reported in line (2), column (6) of

—25—

Table

II.

One hundred dtts, and then one hundred dt's and t'' were

computed, with initial conditions matching the initial values of the S and P

b was then estimated by two step, 2SLS, with a

constant, dt, and dt_i as instruments. Finally, the equation (21) statistic
was calculated.

The distribution of this statistic, which is a x2(2) random variable under

the null, is reported in Table IIIB. In about fourth fifths of the cases, the

statistic was above 5.99, the ninety five per cent level for a x2(2) random
variable. In over nine tenths of the cases, the statistic was over 2.87, the
value reported in line (2), column (5), in Table IA.

Against this alternative, then, the test of instrument residual
orthogonality appears to have reasonable power. Whether this applies to other
alternatives or to the other diagnostic tests performed is uncertain. But the
limited amount of evidence presented here at any rate does not suggest that the

favorable results of the diagnostic tests result solely from low power of the
tests.

B.Variation in discount rates
One possible explanation for the excess variability found in section IV is

that discount rates are time varying, so that the error in equation (1
reflects not only news about dividends but also about discount rates (or,
equivalently,
do

not

expected returns). The diagnostic tests performed in section

IV

seem to suggest such variation, and the section VA(2) analysis just

completed does not seem to indicate that the results of these tests are easily

dismissed. Further consideration of the plausibility of this variation as an
explanation seems warranted nonetheless, given theoretical work such as Lucas
[23] and empirical evidence such as in Shiller [35].

This will be done in two separate exercises. The first (part (1) below)

—26—

assumes as in, e.g., Hansen and

Singleton

[18:1, that a consumption based asset

pricing model determines expected returns, with the representative consumer's

utility function displaying constant relative risk aversion. For small values
of the coefficient of relative risk aversion, this permits exact calculation of

equation (17), the percentage excess variability. The second (part (2) below)
does not model expected returns parametrically but instead uses Shiller's [33]

linearized version of a completely general model. This permits calculation of
a lower bound to how large a standard deviation in expected returns is required
to explain the excess variability reported in Table II.

(1)Consider the class of models (e.g., Hansen and Singleton [18]) in which the

first order condition for the return on a stock is
E[(Ct+1,ct)[(pti+dti)/pt]}IIt = 1, where B, O<B<1, is the representative
consumer's subjective discount rate, C is his real consumption, a his
coefficient of relative risk aversion, with E, dt, Pt and

defined as above.

This may be rearranged as

(22)

t =

-a

-a

dt=dCt

Equation (22) is of the same form as equation (9). So if dt is stationary,
perhaps after one or more differences are taken, the statistics computed in the

constant discount rate case can be computed in this model as well.13
Repetition of the entire procedure is beyond the scope of this paper (and, in

light of the results about to be presented, seems pointless). Instead, I will
focus on obtaining a point estimate of equation (17), the percentage excess
variability, for various imposed values of B and a.

The C, variable used in these calculations was the Grossman and Shiller

A simple plot of dt suggested that

in neither levels nor first or

higher differences is stationary for a much bigger than one. The problem is
that for big a,

dt displays a marked secular decline; this is unsuprising

given that annual C growth was nearly 2 per cent per year, dt growth slightly
above one per cent.

I nonetheless calculated (17), the percentage excess variability, for a
wide range of a, just in case

really is stationary f or large a. This was

done f or =.95 and =.98, with very similar results. In all cases the lag

of the dt autoregression was set to four. Table IVA contains the
figures that resulted for some of the a, with 8=.98. As may be seen, there is
length

no evidence supporting the hypothesis that the excess variability displayed in
Table II is explained solely by the sort of variation in expected returns
predicted by this asset pricing model.15

Since dt does not appear stationary f or a much bigger than unity, it is
equally true that Table IVA contains no evidence against the hypothesis that
the Table II excess variability is explained by variation in expected returns

associated with a coefficient of risk aversion greater than, say, one. Table

IVA does, however, suggest if the model of expected returns assumed here is

correct, that the Table II excess variability is unlikely to be due to
variation in expected returns associated with a coefficient of relative risk
aversion of less than, say, one.

(2)Let us now consider a general model that does not parameterize expected
returns, linearized as in Shiller [33]

to

make the analysis tractable. Let

The left hand side of (23) is precisely the quantity studied in sections

III and IV. If this is positive, as it will be in the model (12), 0r° would
of course satisfy the inequality. The empirical estimates of (16), in Table
II, column (7), however, were negative; the minimum return variability needed

to explain the Table II results is given by the positive 0r that makes (23)

In the linearized model considered here, then, variation In ex ante

expected

returns.

VI. Conclusions

This paper has derived and applied a stock price volatility test. The test

required neither of two strong assumptions required by the Shiller [33]
volatility test: that prices and dividends have finite varIance, and that a
satisfactory approximation to a perfect foresight price can be calculated from
a finite data series.

The test indicated that stock prices are too volatile to be the expected
present discounted value of dividends, with a constant discount rate. Possible
explanations for the test results Include that expectations are not rational,

that discount rates vary and that there are speculative bubbles.

detailed case for bubbles, or, for that matter, any other factor as the

explanation of the excess volatililty is, however, beyond the scope of this
paper.

A challenging task f or future research is to make such a case,

performance of a rational expectations,

They also show that if dividends in fact are such a distributed lag on prices,

gauranteed to be larger, and, in particular, will not be larger in the
(implausible) case of a purely deterministic bubble, c =

A related

paper (West [39]) develops and applies a test that is capable of finding such a

bubble. The results of that paper are consistent with the results of this
paper.

-F 4 —

Since the test in West [39] is a test of cross equation restrictions,
similar to the tests developed in Sargent [31] and Hansen and Sargent [17],
this seems the appropriate place to comment on Hansen and Sargent's [16] point
that tests of cross equation restrictions test all the restrictions of a linear

rational expectations model, while volatility tests do not. The latter part of
this statement is illustrated for the present paper's test by the comments in
the preceding paragraph.

There are at least two reasons why stock market volatility tests are
valuable nonetheless. The first is that a volatility test may have more power
against a particular alternative than a test of cross equation restrictions.
In the present context, this is perhaps reflected by the stronger rejection of

the null in the present paper than in West [39], for differenced
specifications.

The second is that if a model is rejected by both tests,

characterization of prices as "excessively volatile" may to some economists be

a more provocative stimulus to future research than is a characterization of

prices as "failing to obey cross equation constraints."

That a

characterization as "excessively volatile" is provocative to some is perhaps

evidenced by the the strong reaction, both favorable and unfavorable, to the
Shiller [33] volatility test.

In any case, the West [39] test of cross equation restrictions and the
present paper are complementary studies. Those who argue for regression tests
instead of volatility tests (see the discussion Hansen and Sargent [16]) are
likely to prefer West [39], while those who argue for the converse (see the
discussion in Shiller [3)4])

9.

are

likely to prefer the present paper.

Standard diagnostic tests will not suffice to find a misspecificatiori of

the dividend equation if the sample size is not large enough to infer the

-F5-

parameters of the true dividend process. This might be the case because a
small probability event, which is rationally considered by market participants,

has not occurred.
obviously

The best protection against such a biased sample is

to use a large sample, which is what I did.

In addition, it is

worth noting that one important example of

such a low

probability event is allowed in the present framework. Suppose the market is
considering

a disaster such as nationalization that will set dividends to zero.

The probability of disaster is 0.

Shiller [3)4] shows that equation (9) is

still valid, with b interpreted as the product of a discount rate and 1-0. It
follows that if (12) is true, (13) should hold.

10. For a nice general equilibrium model that allows bubbles, see Tirole [37];

it is perhaps worth noting that in Tirole's deterministic, perfect foresight
steady state, asset returns are constant, just as are expected returns in the

stochastic environment considered here. For an argument that volatility tests

cannot be used to infer the presence of bubbles, see Hamilton and Whiteman
[12].

The formula f or m may be found in

I tested this equality constraint for all seven specifications, with the

number of lags used in the calculation of the matrix S (defined in the
appendix) set to 11. The z—statistics for the seven specifications, presented
in the same order as in Table II, were: 1.88, 2.07, 1.71, 2.23, 1.85, 2.17,
1.71. Thus this suggests some mild evidence against the null hypothesis.

The basic reason for the relatively low statistics was a very noisy
estimate of var[p÷dt —

(m56idt_1+i)J.

This was insignificantly different

from zero at the five per cent level, f or all seven specifications. One
possible reason for this noisy estimate is that there are bubbles:

if so,

var[P+d — (m+'51dt_1+1)J is not even finite.

I thank R. Flood for pointing this out to me.

15. Note that the entries in the table are not a monotonic function of a. To
make sure that the entries were representative, I calculated the percentage
excess variability for a in steps of 0.1 from 0 to 3.0, in steps of 1.0 from
3.0 to 10.0, and in steps of 5.0 from 10.0 to 50.0. The results were quite
similar

to those reported in the table. The lowest percentage happened to

occur at a'2.O.

The conditions in Hansen [15). White and Doaiowitz [112] and Newey and West

[27) unfortunately do not cover the case when n41 is nonstationary. The
formulas just given are, however, still basically applicable, at least under

the conditions listed in the assumptions given below. The only difference
between the stationary and the nonstationary cases is that a certain term in

hte that depends on plimT1Zn+iu+1 is set to zero in the nonstationary case.

The remainder of this appendix sketches the argument necessary to
establish the asymptotic distribution of 0 in the nonstationary case. A
