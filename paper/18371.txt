ABSTRACT
A growing literature documents the links between long-term outcomes and health in the fetal period,
infancy, and early childhood. Much of this literature focuses on rich countries, but researchers are
increasingly taking advantage of new sources of data and identification to study the long reach of childhood
health in developing countries. Health in early life may be a more significant determinant of adult
outcomes in these countries because health insults are more frequent, the capacity to remediate is more
limited, and multiple shocks may interact. However, the underlying relationships may also be more
difficult to measure, given significant mortality selection. We survey recent evidence on the adult
correlates of early-life health and the long-term effects of shocks due to disease, famine, malnutrition,
pollution, and war.

1. Introduction
A growing body of evidence documents that healthy children tend to become healthy and
wealthy adults (Almond and Currie 2010, 2011; Currie 2011). For example, anthropometric
markers such as birth weight and child height are related to future schooling, employment,
earnings, family formation, and health. Findings from natural experiments suggest that these
relationships in large part reflect a pathway running from childhood health to adult outcomes. To
the extent that inequalities and shortfalls in adult outcomes are predicted by early-life health,
these results may offer additional justification for policies aimed at improving child health.
Much of the existing literature focuses on rich countries, but researchers are increasingly
taking advantage of new sources of data and identification to study the long reach of childhood
health in developing countries. Far beyond simply extending the work on rich countries, this
research on poorer countries has much policy relevance; health shocks in early life are widespread in the developing world. The survey papers by Strauss and Thomas (2008) and Bleakley
(2010) review some of this work but do not focus on it. In this paper, we review recent research
on the long-term effects of health shocks before age 10 in developing countries. To distinguish
ourselves from previous authors, we limit our attention to findings since 2004, many of which
are not discussed in previous surveys.
We argue that the long-term effects of such shocks are likely to be larger in developing
countries for several reasons. First, such shocks are simply more frequent in many developing
countries than in the industrialized world, suggesting that the lingering effects of early-life health
problems may well be more important in developing countries. Second, child health shocks are
likely to interact. For example, a child who is malnourished may be less able to ward off, or to
recover from, disease. Similarly, a mother who was malnourished may bear a child who is

1

compromised in her ability to cope with health insults. Moreover, if there are non-linearities in
the production function for child health, then the same shock may have quite different effects
depending on starting levels of health.
Third, the long-run consequences of early-life health shocks depend on the availability
and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. To the extent that parents in rich countries are better
able to compensate for shocks, the long-term effects of poor health in childhood may be greater
in developing countries. For example, a relatively common congenital anomaly such as cleft
palate is easily corrected in rich countries but may lead to a great deal of suffering in poorer
settings. On the other hand, if mitigation were universally ineffective across countries, then
outcomes might be similar across countries, reflecting a purely biological response.
Early-life health may not only be a more important determinant of adult outcomes in developing countries; its importance may have also increased as childhood mortality rates have
declined. Bozzoli et al. (2009) highlight the potential importance of mortality selection: When
children die, their long-term outcomes are not measured. Consequently, as infant and child
mortality decrease, population average outcomes such as employment and earnings could
actually fall, or at least rise more slowly than they would have otherwise, as more unhealthy
children live to adulthood. The selection biases introduced by changes in the distribution of
survivors are cause for concern in nearly all of the papers we review, and we will revisit them
often in our discussion.
Our review is divided in two broad parts. The first deals with associations between
measures of early-life health and adult outcomes, while the second describes attempts to disentangle the causal path running from childhood to adulthood. The literature on associations of
child health measures with adult outcomes goes back several decades, and in our discussion of it,

2

we concentrate on the retrospective measure that the development literature commonly uses:
height. We argue that height captures aspects of the early-life experience similar to those captured by measures more common in the literature on wealthy countries, such as birth weight. Yet
height, unlike birth weight, does not require longitudinal data for linkage with other adult outcomes. Nonetheless, despite its broad informational content and ease of data collection, height
does not allow researchers to identify which specific aspects of the childhood environment have
long-lasting effects.
As a result, we devote the second section of our review to research that traces out the effects of specific changes in the child health environment. To structure the discussion, we separate
this work into five thematic categories, each for a separate source of ill health: (chronic) malnutrition, famine, disease, pollution, and war. These health insults affect their childhood victims in
diverse ways, and they cause differing degrees of mortality selection. Additionally, as we show
below, the long-term effects of the same health condition often vary considerably by setting, by
gender, or even by socioeconomic status.
Given that different afflictions may have different effects in the same population, and a
single affliction may have varied effects across populations, much remains to be learned about
the long-term effects of child health in poorer countries. Similarly, while the concepts of “critical
periods” and “catch up growth” have been in the literature for a long time, we still know relatively little either about which periods of childhood are critical for particular types of development,
or about how much recovery from health insults is possible. We conclude with some thoughts on
fruitful directions for future research. Richer data are becoming available, and the subjects of a
recent spate of child health related randomized trials (e.g., Baird et al. 2011) are starting to come
of age. These developments are sure to give rise to many useful new insights.

2. Height as a Proxy for the Early-Life Environment
The size and shape of the human body provide a window into the cumulative shocks it
has experienced over its lifetime. Researchers have thus used various measures of the body and
its growth rate to gauge health.1 Of the various anthropometric measures studied, the most
common are weight, typically a proxy for short-term nutritional status, and height, a marker of
health and nutrition during the critical periods of growth in early life (especially from conception
to age 3). Absent more direct measures of early-life health, investigations into the effects of
early-life conditions have often relied instead on height and birth weight. A large literature
explores the later-life correlates of birth weight in industrialized countries, but the literature on
poorer countries has focused on height, given the paucity of good longitudinal data following
individuals in those settings from birth into adulthood.
In the cases of both height and birth weight, bigger is better. On average, adults who
stand taller or were born heavier fare better on a range of social, economic, and cognitive outcomes (see, e.g., Currie 2009; Steckel 2008). Interpretations of these patterns are fairly uniform
for birth weight but more variable for height. Perhaps because of the proximity of birth weight to
the intra-uterine environment, few have questioned that its relationship with adult outcomes
reflects the effects of early-life health, at least after appropriately controlling for family background characteristics.
In contrast, a surfeit of theories aims to explain the link between height and various
measures of wellbeing and success. One class of theories, especially popular in the development
economics literature, attributes the height premium to the greater strength and health of taller
individuals, which increases their productivity (Haddad and Bouis 1991, Thomas and Strauss
1

The study of the economic, social, and psychological correlates of body size dates at least as far back as the work
of eugenicists and biological anthropologists in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Porter 1892; Macdonell
1902, Pearson 1906, Gowin 1915).

4

1997). A closely related hypothesis stems from the observation that physical growth and cognitive development share inputs in early life. These common inputs induce a correlation between
height and cognitive ability, so in addition to being stronger and healthier, taller individuals are
smarter (Case and Paxson 2008). But several competing psychosocial theories offer explanations
for the height premium that do not rely on the biology of skill formation. Some researchers posit
that height affects individual achievement through self-esteem (Wilson 1968; Lechelt 1975;
Freedman 1979; Young and French 1996), social dominance (Klein et al. 1972; Hensley 1993),
or discrimination (Loh 1993; Magnusson, Rasmussen, and Gyllensten 2006). These theories have
attracted far more attention in rich countries than poor, but even in rich countries, nationally
representative data strongly support explanations rooted in the biology of skill formation (Case
and Paxson 2008, Lundborg et al. 2009). On the other hand, biological mechanisms and psychosocial mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

Silventoinen et al. (2000) and Sundet et al. (2005), both studying thousands of twin pairs, find that over half of the
relationship between height and cognition can be attributed to non-genetic rather than genetic factors. Notably, the
studies use data from wealthy, egalitarian, Scandinavian countries, where the variability of childhood conditions is
likely much smaller than in developing countries, making genes relatively more important.

The Association Between Height and Birth Weight
The framework posits that adult height and birth weight reflect similar underlying variables. Indeed, height and birth weight are highly correlated in settings rich and poor, both across
and within families.5 To give a sense of this empirical regularity, Table 1 examines the association between birth weight and young adult height in two cohorts, one born in 1958 in Great
Britain, the other born in 1983-4 in the Philippine ‘metro’ area of Cebu (which encompasses both
urban and rural communities). Towards the bottom of the table, we present the means and
standard deviations of birth weight and height in the two samples.6 As might be expected given
the nutritional disparities between the two settings, both measures of body size have significantly
lower means in the Philippines than in Britain. Surprisingly, the variances of both variables are
higher in Britain than in the Philippines. Based on this result alone, however, one cannot quantify
differences in the variances of early-life conditions (

) and the variances of the residuals (

).

The forward and reverse regressions of the two variables shed some light on this issue. In
the first two lines of Table 1, we present the slope coefficients from the regression of height on

(2002) and Adair (2007). For evidence on developed countries, see the cross-sectional studies by Kuh and
Wadsworth (1989), Sørensen et al. (1999), and Pietiläinen et al. (2001), as well as the twin studies by Behrman and
Rosenzweig (2005) and Black et al. (2007).

birth weight and the reverse, in both cases controlling for gender. All of the slope coefficients are
highly statistically significant, indicating a strong relationship between height and birth weight.
A 1 kilogram increase in birth weight is associated with a 3-4 centimeter increase in height.7
Consistent with the prediction that

⁄

is smaller in developing countries, both slope

coefficients are higher in the Philippines than in Britain. However, the difference in coefficients
approaches statistical significance only in the regressions of birth weight on height. For a summary statistic that more clearly describes the combined signal that height and birth weight have
for the early-life environment, consider the inverse of the product of the slope coefficients:
plim
where

refers to height and

(5)

refers to birth weight. As Equation (5) shows, this statistic

summarizes the importance of residual variation relative to joint input variation in producing
height and birth weight. In the third line of Table 1, we report this inverse product for each of our
samples. As expected, the relative importance of residual variation is significantly higher in
Britain than in the Philippines. This result implies that the higher overall variances of height and
birth weight in Britain derive from the residual variance, rather than the variance of joint inputs.
Perhaps contemporary Britain has greater genetic diversity than the Philippines. Whatever the
case, its greater variance in body size does not reflect a greater variance in childhood conditions.
Apart from the Cebu Longitudinal Study, precisely measured birth weight data are rare in
large sample surveys from developing countries, as are longitudinal data following babies into
adulthood. In consequence, the development literature—as well as the economic history literature, for similar reasons—has largely relied on height. An important exception to this generalization is a recent paper by Bharadwaj et al. (2010) that links Chilean birth data for all children born

between 1992 and 2000 to data on educational attainment up to the 8th grade, and to data on
parental time use. Twin fixed effects models show a persistent positive impact of birth weight on
educational attainment. Aside from this recent paper, however, most work on developing countries focuses on height.
Changes in Average Height
The literature on height is in part motivated by the remarkable increasing secular trend in
heights over the past two centuries. The trend began in Europe, which economic historians
attribute to rising living standards (Floud, Wachter, and Gregory 1990; Fogel 2004; Steckel
1995, 2008).8 Japan followed somewhat later (Shay 1994), as the Japanese economy entered a
period of rapid growth in the late nineteenth century. Many countries still classified today as
“developing” also saw rising average heights across cohorts born in the twentieth century
(Strauss and Thomas 1998). These transformations in the average size of the human body
occurred too quickly to be driven by evolution.
Indeed, researchers have now amassed considerable evidence that these secular increases
in height have antecedents in early-life health. Many studies show that child and adult height are
associated with parental socioeconomic status, nutrition, and access to clean water and sanitation
during childhood.9 Additionally, a number of the quasi-experimental studies reviewed below
suggest that these associations represent causal effects of childhood conditions.
Selective mortality presents an obstacle to detecting a relationship between early childhood conditions and future outcomes. This issue arises in the quasi-experimental studies re-

8

The United States is a notable exception to the increasing trend in height in Western countries during the 1800s
and 1900s. Average heights only began to meaningfully increase around the turn of the twentieth century, after a
short period of declining heights during the initial phases of industrialization (Costa and Steckel 1997). However,
mean height was already far higher in the United States than in Europe in the early days of the republic. European
heights caught up with American heights in the twentieth century (Steckel 1995).

viewed below but is also apparent in the distribution of average heights across countries and
birth cohorts. Studying a country-birth cohort panel from the Demographic and Health Surveys,
Deaton (2007) demonstrates that higher national income and lower child mortality in the year of
birth are associated with increased height outside Africa. But within Africa, where mortality
rates are high, declines in child mortality are associated with decreased height, and national
income bears no relation to height after controlling for mortality. These findings suggest that
selective mortality may be an important force in determining the distribution of heights among
African adults. In this sense, they offer one explanation for why Africans are much taller than
one would expect in light of their incomes.
Height and Other Adult Outcomes
In settings with limited selective mortality, height correlates with skill; the inputs that
promote healthy growth in childhood also promote the development of both physical and cognitive skills. Studies in a variety of countries, rich and poor, confirm this correlation. Table 2
provides an overview of three recent studies on developing countries. It shows that height is
associated with adult cognitive test scores in China (Huang et al. 2012); in Mexico (Vogl 2012);
and in urban areas in Barbados, Mexico, Cuba, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil (Maurer 2010).10
Research assessing the relationship between adult height and physical skill is rarer, but Swedish
data suggest a robust relationship between height and grip strength, muscular strength, maximum
working capacity, and maximum power expended on a stationary bicycle (Lundborg et al. 2011).
Height is also associated with non-cognitive skills (Lundborg et al. 2011; Schick and Steckel
2010), but the importance of this correlation in developing countries remains unstudied.

10

For similar results in industrialized countries see Britain (Richards et al. 2002); Sweden (Tuvemo et al. 1999;
Magnusson et al. 2006); and the United States (Case and Paxson 2008). See also Tanner (1979). Abbott et al. (1998)
find a similar result in a sample of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii, many of whom were born in Japan in the early
twentieth century.

10

Possibly as a byproduct of the correlation between height and various skills, height is associated with wage gains many developing economies. In the rural Philippines, an extra centimeter of height is associated with 2 percent higher wages (Haddad and Bouis 1991); in Mexico, this
semi-elasticity is 2.5 (Vogl 2012). Height and wages are also strongly correlated in Ghana and
Brazil (Strauss and Thomas 1998; Schultz 2002), although the estimation strategies used for
these settings are not directly comparable with other studies. Consistent with the implications of
the statistical framework earlier in this section, the relationship between height and earnings is
positive but smaller in wealthy countries (Persico et al. 2004; Case and Paxson 2008; Lundborg
et al. 2009). Cognitive and physical skills explain a large share of the earnings premium paid to
taller workers in these richer settings.
Evidence on the role of skills in explaining the height premium in developing countries is
scarcer. Many authors (e.g., Thomas and Strauss 1997; Schultz 2002) note that height is associated with educational attainment, although they generally reason that this result reflects correlated parental investments in health and education, rather than shared inputs in the production
functions for height and skill. In more recent data from Mexico, Vogl (2012) finds mixed evidence on the role of cognitive skill in explaining the relationship between height and earnings.
On the one hand, an adult cognitive test score only explains a small share of the height premium.11 On the other hand, taller workers sort into occupations with higher cognitive skill requirements, consistent with a Roy model in which the return to cognitive (rather than physical) skill
drives the height premium, and similar to the occupational sorting observed in industrialized
countries (Case and Paxson 2008). In Mexico, the sorting of taller workers into higher-skill
occupations almost entirely reflects their greater educational attainment. Collectively, these
results suggest either that cognitive ability (and therefore height) increases the productivity of

schooling, or that parents who invest more in health and nutrition also tend to invest more in
other forms of human capital.
Additional evidence on the relative importance of brains and brawn can be found in the
literature relating short-term nutritional status to wages. One body of work uses local food prices
as instruments for the body mass index (BMI) and nutrient consumption, finding effects of these
variables on wages for men but less so for women (Thomas and Strauss 1997; Rosenzweig et al.
2011).12 These estimated effects suggest that physical strength and robustness remain important
in developing economy labor markets, especially for men. Note that instrumental variables
methods are more appropriate for estimating the effect of body weight than for estimating the
“effect” of height. Several studies, including Schultz (2002) and Behrman et al. (2009), use
early-life conditions as instruments in estimating the “effect” of height on wages. However, if
height is primarily a proxy for early-life conditions, then we see more justification for studying
the reduced-form effects of the “instruments” directly. Height becomes useful as an independent
variable precisely when we cannot observe all relevant determinants of childhood development.
For much the same reason, we cannot use adult height to distinguish the effects of in utero
shocks from those of postnatal shocks. Nonetheless, given the ease of measurement, height
provides a useful retrospective proxy for health and nutrition in the early years of life.

3. Evidence Regarding the Longer Term Effects of Early-Life Shocks
In the preceding section, we elaborated on the argument that early-life shocks might have
larger effects in developing countries; provided a justification for viewing adult height as an
outcome; and emphasized the potential importance of mortality selection. In this section, we

Rosenzweig et al.’s (2011) results also indicate that, among men but not women, increased body weight decreases
schooling attainment and increases selection into strength-intensive occupations.

review the recent literature regarding specific types of early-life shocks: malnutrition, famine,
disease, pollution, and war.
Nutrition
Table 3 provides an overview of some recent studies examining the longer-term impacts
of poor nutrition in childhood. Here we focus on moderate and chronic malnutrition; we discuss
famine in the next section. Recent studies have focused on the roles of specific nutrients, and on
the question of whether children recover from nutritional shocks during critical periods, such as
while they are in utero or in the first year of life.
In one recent study, Malluccio et al. (2009) report on a long-running randomized INCAP
(Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama) experiment that involved giving Guatemalan children zero to seven years old a high-protein energy drink (the treatment) or a placebo
with a similar number of calories. The findings suggest that the treatment increased schooling
attainment among women by 1.2 grades, and cognitive ability by .24 standard deviations for both
men and women. Hoddinott et al. (2008) study the same intervention and find that nutritional
supplements in the first two years of life increased male wages by 46 percent.13 These large
effects suggest that an early diet that is sufficient in calories but not in protein can have severe
long-term consequences.
Quasi-experimental studies also provide evidence on the importance of specific nutrients.
In one prominent example, Field et al. (2009) examine the effect of fetal exposure to iodine
supplementation as part of a large but episodically implemented government program in Tanza-

13

In absolute terms, Hoddinott et al. (2008) find an effect of US $0.67 per hour, with a 95 percent confidence
interval of 0.16-1.17. The point estimate is 46 percent of the average wage, and the confidence interval runs from 11
percent to 80 percent.

13

nia.14 Iodine deficiency in pregnant women has been linked to mental retardation in affected
fetuses but has been virtually eliminated in developed countries. Field et al. find that children
who benefited from the supplements in utero experienced large gains in educational attainment.
The effects were larger for girls than for boys, which is consistent with scientific evidence that
female fetuses are more vulnerable to damage from iodine deficiency.
A number of recent studies examine the long-term effects of general nutritional deprivation at particular critical periods. Almond and Mazumder (2011) provide evidence on this front
in their analysis of the effect of maternal fasting during Ramadan on children in utero. Their
study relies on the fact that the timing of Ramadan moves throughout the year, so that the effects
can be distinguished from seasonal variation. Using Census data from Uganda and Iraq, they
show cohorts affected by maternal fasting are 22 to 23 percent more likely to be disabled in
adulthood. In comparison, the estimated effect on disability rates among Arab-named adults in
the U.S. is only slightly lower, at 19 percent.
Variation in adult outcomes by season of birth may also shed light on the effects of earlychildhood health. In their examination of the age of heart disease onset in Puerto Rico, McEniry
and Palloni (2010) focus on whether subjects were in utero during the “hungry season.” They
find a monotonic relationship between length of exposure and the probability of heart disease.
Among those exposed to poor conditions throughout pregnancy, 23 percent had heart disease,
compared to 15 to 18 percent among individuals who were partially exposed and 11 percent
among those who were not exposed. They note, however, that it is difficult to separate the effects

14

Another recent analysis of a natural experiment involving nutrient supplementation can be found in the work of
Linnemayr and Alderman (2011), who evaluate a nutrition enhancement program in Senegal that was phased in at
the village level. The program had multiple components, including Vitamin A and iron supplements for pregnant
women. While the results vary somewhat with the estimation method, they find consistent evidence that maternal
participation during pregnancy was associated with improvements in child weight-for-age. We do not report this
paper in Table 3 because the weight measurements are from childhood as well.

of poor nutrition from the effects of exposure to disease or other seasonal factors in this type of
research design. Additionally, the socioeconomic and demographic composition of mothers
varies over the year, which presents additional challenges to interpreting this work (Lam and
Miron 1994; Buckles and Hungerman 2013).
Research on rainfall shocks provides more convincing evidence on the effects of experiencing hunger in early life. In one such study, Maccini and Yang (2009) link adults in the
Indonesia Family Life Survey to data on rainfall in their birth districts during their birth years.
They hypothesize that higher rainfall is linked to better nutrition in the first year through its
effects on harvests. Indeed, higher early-life rainfall affects height and a range of other adult
outcomes for women but not men. For women, a ten percent increase in local rainfall in the year
of birth leads to a 0.3-centimeter increase in height, a 0.1-year increase in education attainment,
and a 0.12-standard deviation increase in an index of household durable goods ownership. The
results for men are statistically insignificant and less consistent, although the (imprecise) estimates of the effect of rainfall on height remain positive. One could interpret the weaker results
for men as reflecting mortality selection, since boys are more vulnerable than girls to dying in
childhood (Waldron 1983).15
Further evidence on the importance of mortality selection can be found in Indian women,
among whom early-life rainfall increases average adult height for upper castes but lowers
average adult height for lower castes (Pathania 2009). The child mortality rates of the lower
castes may be more environmentally sensitive, increasing the likelihood of selective mortality.
This reasoning implies that higher early-life rainfall does not diminish the health of children
from lower castes but rather keeps unhealthy ones alive. These patterns have diminished in more
15

As a test for mortality selection, Maccini and Yang (2009) estimate the effect of early-life rainfall on cohort size,
finding no effect. However, they run this test either for women only or for both men and women. (The paper is
unclear on this issue.) Theory might predict an effect on male cohort size only.

15

recent cohorts, which have experienced lower rates of child mortality. According to new research
by Shah and Millett-Steinberg (2012), exposure to drought in utero reduces test scores among
Indian children of school age regardless of parental socioeconomic status.16 Rocha and Soares
(2011) find that exposure to drought reduces both infant health and the subsequent primary
schooling performance of cohorts who were exposed in utero.
Famine
Several attributes distinguish famines from the localized rainfall shocks that Maccini and
Yang (2009) and Pathania (2009) study. First, in general equilibrium, famines affect both food
prices and farmers’ incomes, while localized rainfall shortfalls affect only incomes. Second,
perhaps due in part to price adjustments, famines are typically more severe than localized shocks,
with massive effects on mortality. As a result, concerns about selective mortality are likely to be
more relevant in studies of famine. Third, unlike localized weather shocks, famines arguably
have as much to do with politics as with food output (Drèze and Sen 1991). Thus, research
strategies designed to measure the effects of localized rainfall shocks may fail to generate
plausible estimates of the effects of famine.
Table 4 summarizes a growing literature aimed at detecting the long-term health effects
of famine in developing countries. As Table 4 makes clear, most of this literature has focused on
the effect of exposure in utero, with relatively little information available about the effect of
exposure in early childhood. This focus on the in utero period is inspired by the literature on the
“Barker hypothesis” (Barker, 2001) which suggests that events during pregnancy can have longterm effects by “programming” the development of the fetus. See Almond and Currie (2011) for
a review of this fetal effects literature.
16

Interestingly, Shah and Millett-Steinberg (2012) also find that current exposure to drought improves test scores in
school-aged children, which they interpret as a substitution effect due to drought-related reductions in parents’ and
children’s opportunity costs of time.

16

Most studies of the in utero effects of famine identify cohorts of affected children and
follow them over time. One potential difficulty is that children who were already born at the time
of the famine are also subject to nutritional deprivation, though at a later stage. This partial
exposure of pre-famine cohorts suggests that the in utero cohort must be compared to cohorts in
utero after the famine only. However, individuals in utero after the famine were conceived
during or after the famine, which raises concerns about fertility responses to the famine, which
may change the composition of parents having children. Post-famine cohorts may thus have
different background characteristics from the in utero cohort.
The cohort-based approaches provide some evidence of the effects of famine on longterm outcomes. Meng and Qian (2009) and Umana-Aponte (2011) evaluate the effect of famine
exposure in utero on years of schooling in China (1959) and Uganda (1980), respectively.
Relative to pre- and post-famine cohorts, cohorts exposed to famine in utero attained approximately 0.58 fewer years of schooling in China and 0.364 fewer years of schooling in Uganda. In
results from Ethiopia, Dercon and Porter (2010) estimate that a 1984 famine reduced the probability of completing primary school by 2 percent for cohort exposed at two to three years of age,
but had no effect on education for the cohort exposed in utero. They do, however, find effects on
height in both cohorts.
The Chinese famine has received particular attention, and several papers provide evidence complementary to Meng and Qian’s. As with the studies described in the previous paragraph, analyses of the Chinese famine use both pre- and post-famine cohorts as control groups.
Chen and Zhou (2007) examine the effects of the Chinese famine on height, finding a decrease
of 3 cm for those born or conceived during the famine. Gørgens et al. (2012) report a similar
stunting effect of the famine on the rural Chinese population for whom the famine was most

17

severe. In further analyses of socioeconomic outcomes, Almond et al. (2010) estimate that
women (men) exposed to the Chinese famine in utero were 3 percent (5.9 percent) less likely to
work and 13 percent (12 percent) more likely to be disabled, and that men were 6.5 percent less
likely to be married. Finally, building on earlier research examining the effects of the Dutch
“hunger winter” of 1944 on a wide range of outcomes (see for example, Lumey et al. 2011), two
papers investigate the effects of the 1959 Chinese famine on other health outcomes. Fung (2009)
demonstrates that in utero exposure to famine predicts obesity for women, but not for men, while
St. Clair et al. (2005) find that prenatal and infant exposure to famine doubles the likelihood of
developing schizophrenia.
Since famine often involves substantial mortality, it can be difficult to interpret the
magnitudes of the effects. Indeed, the data suggest that mortality selection may severely dampen
the estimated effects of early-life shocks on the average height of adult survivors. For example,
data on Chinese adults show little sign of a decline in average heights among cohorts exposed to
the Great Famine in early life unless one accounts for selection (Gørgens et al. 2012). In Meng
and Qian’s study (2009) stunting effects are most noticeable at the upper quantiles of the height
distribution, as would be expected if mortality culled individuals from the bottom tail of the
height distribution.
Disease
Historical studies in developed countries suggest that the introduction of effective treatments for childhood disease had profound effects on future outcomes and population health. For
example, Bhalotra and Venkataramani (2011) examine the introduction of sulfa drugs in the U.S.
in the 1930s, which were highly efficacious for pneumonia. Pneumonia was a leading killer of
children in the U.S., much as it is in the developing world today. They compare areas with

18

initially high death rates due to pneumonia to areas with initially lower rates, arguing that sulfa
drugs ought to have had a greater impact in the former than in the latter. They find that sulfa drug
availability in utero and in early childhood increased years of schooling by 0.09 years, increased
income by 2.3 percent, and increased employment by 1.2 percent for men. The results for women
are small and insignificant, which they interpret as evidence that the gains to men arose primarily
because better health led to increased returns in the labor market. Using a somewhat similar
research design, Bleakley (2007) compares school enrollment, attendance, literacy, and years of
schooling of individuals born in areas with high and low hookworm endemicity, before and after
the eradication of hookworm in the United States. He finds that a one-standard deviation reduction in the hookworm rate increased school enrollment by 0.25-standard deviations, increased
literacy, and fulltime attendance, but had no effect on years of schooling.
Table 5 summarizes several recent papers examining the effect of early-life disease exposure on future outcomes in developing countries. The papers deal with both endemic and epidemic diseases, taking advantage of both increases and decreases in incidence. In particular,
several studies exploit variation in the incidence of endemic disease—such as helminth infection
and malaria—that was induced by large-scale eradication campaigns.
One set of papers (Nelson (2010) on Brazil and Lin and Liu (2011) on Taiwan) investigates the long-term effects of in utero exposure to influenza using a cohort comparison methodology similar to that in Almond (2006). They examine the impact of exposure to the 1919
influenza epidemic by focusing on the affected cohort’s break from trend relative to cohorts born
just before and after the outbreak. Following Almond (2006), Lin (2011) also incorporates
geographic variation in mortality as an indicator for the intensity of prenatal influenza exposure.
The 1919 Brazilian cohort that was exposed to the pandemic in utero finished 0.2 fewer years of

19

schooling, had 20 percent lower wages, and members were 20 percent less likely to be employed.
In Taiwan, each 1 percent increase in the birth year maternal mortality rate (a proxy for influenza
incidence) led to a reduction of 0.343 years of schooling. Those affected were also 3.6 percent,
2.1 percent, 1.6 percent, and 0.06 percent less likely to complete elementary school, junior high
school, high school, and college, respectively relative to cohorts born just before or just after.
It is somewhat difficult to compare effect sizes when baseline levels of outcomes like education were so different across countries. Almond (2006) reports that the U.S. cohort affected
by the 1919 epidemic had 0.125 fewer years of schooling, earned 5 percent lower wages, and
were 20 percent more likely to be disabled. This comparison suggests that perhaps flu exposure
had a larger effect on future wages in Brazil than in the U.S. Kelly (2009) finds small effects of
the 1957 Asian flu pandemic on British children’s test scores at ages 7 and 11. Just as we have
speculated that the effects of early health shocks might be smaller in developed countries than in
developing ones, it is possible that the effects of the 1957 flu were smaller than those of the 1919
flu pandemic because of improvements in medical care or in the underlying health of those
affected. Note that if the extent of mortality selection had fallen between 1919 and 1957, then we
would expect the estimated effect of the later epidemic to be larger than that of the earlier
epidemic.
Several studies estimate the effect of specific diseases by examining eradication campaigns in a difference-in-differences framework, much as in the papers by Bhalotra and Venkataramani (2011) and Bleakley (2007) described above. This research strategy compares crosscohort changes in areas with high initial disease prevalence to cross-cohort changes in areas that
have lower initial disease prevalence because the former are more likely to be affected by the
eradication campaigns.

20

Three papers apply this method in asking whether early-life malaria exposure affects
socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood. Using data from the U.S. South and Latin America,
Bleakley (2010) estimates that 100 percent eradication of malarial infections increased subsequent adult income by 47 percent in the US, 45 percent in Brazil, 45 percent in Colombia, and 41
percent in Mexico. Bleakley also finds positive effects on literacy, but mixed results for years of
schooling. Cutler et al. (2010), studying India’s malaria eradication campaign of the 1950s, also
detect no effect on educational attainment. However, consistent with Bleakley (2010), they find
that malaria eradication increased household consumption, perhaps implying that the eradication
of malaria increases incomes by allowing people to work more, or at higher productivity jobs.
These results highlight the fact that reductions in disease can work through multiple channels and
can well have effects on income through improved health or labor force participation even if they
have no effects on schooling or cognition. Indeed, in some circumstances, improvements in
health may have positive effects on earnings even if they decrease educational attainment. Even
so, not all studies of malaria eradication fail to find effects on educational attainment. In her
study of eradication in Paraguay and Sri Lanka, Lucas (2010) estimates that a 10-percentage
point reduction in malaria incidence increases female schooling by 0.1 years and female literacy
by 1 percentage point.
Complementing Bleakley’s (2007) work on the historical United States, several studies
examine the effect of deworming on medium and long-term outcomes in developing countries. In
a well-known paper, Miguel and Kremer (2004) analyze the experimental introduction of deworming treatments in Kenyan schools. The deworming intervention increased school attendance by 7 percent but had no effect on test scores. In a follow-up study, however, Baird et al.
(2011) find that self-reported health, years of schooling, and test scores all increased for the

21

treated group. Hours worked rose 12 percent in the full sample and 20 percent among those who
were working for wages. Moreover, Ozier (2011) shows that deworming school-aged children
had positive externalities on very young children in the same community, fitting for a communicable disease like helminth infection. Children less than one year old during the treatment
experienced IQ gains on the order of 0.2-standard deviations, which translated into an additional
0.5-0.8 years of schooling.
Pollution
The literature on determinants of child health in developing countries has traditionally focused
on disease and nutrition.17 However, children are more vulnerable than adults to the effects of
many types of pollutants, both because they are still developing and because their small size
means that they may end up with relatively high doses per unit body mass. For example, children
are more susceptible to lead poisoning because the blood-brain barrier that protects adults is not
fully formed. These considerations suggest that the alarmingly high levels of contamination of
air, water, and soil in many developing countries could have extremely harmful long-term
consequences for child development.
In many cases, the pollution levels in developing countries are outside the range that has
been studied in the developed world, and may be outside the range of pollution levels that
existed historically. For example, in Chay and Greenstone’s (2003a,b) path-breaking work
examining reductions in Total Suspended Particles (TSPs) in the 1970s and early 1980s U.S.,
“low” TSP implies concentrations of 44 ug/m3 and “high” TSP concentrations were 92 ug/m3.
Wang et al. (1997) study pollution in residential areas of Beijing from 1988-1991 and consider
TSP levels ranging from 150 to 700 ug/m3. Similarly, roughly 70 percent of the river water in
17

In many settings these killers remain the greatest threats. For example, Field et al. (2011) show that when
households in Bangladesh abandoned tube wells that were contaminated with arsenic, mortality from diarrheal
disease doubled.

22

China is unsafe for human consumption, although many people in rural areas rely on these
sources for drinking water (World Bank, 2006). Brainerd and Menon (2011) find that a 10
percent increase in chemical runoff from fertilizers in the water increases infant mortality by
11.26 percent and decreases height for age by 0.14 standard deviations.
There is now considerable evidence from developed countries that air pollution has harmful effects on birth weight and infant mortality (see Currie, 2011 for a recent summary of this
literature) and a growing literature showing that this is also true in the developed world. Foster et
al. (2009) study air pollution in Mexico using satellite measures of aerosol optical depth. Variation in pollution comes from a voluntary certification program, and regional variation in the
supply of auditors available to implement the program. They find that a 3.6 percent improvement
in aerosol optical depth resulted in a 16 percent decline in infant mortality due to respiratory
illness, but no decline from deaths due to external causes (a control cause). Jayachandran (2009)
estimates OLS models where an average aerosol index (TOMS) captures the variation in pollution levels that resulted from the 1997 Indonesian wildfires. Her results indicate that areas
affected by the smoke suffered a 1.2 percent reduction in birth cohort size with the largest effects
among the poor, a result that highlights the importance of selection once again. Despite these
concerns about selection bias, the Wang et al. study mentioned above found that each 100-ug/m3
increase in SO2 (TSP) exposure in the third trimester reduces birth weight by 7.3 (6.9) grams and
increased the probability of low birth weight by 11 percent (10 percent).
The question of precisely which pollutants are most harmful is important for policy and is
difficult to address, given that many pollutants come from the same sources and are highly
correlated. Moreover, mechanisms are not well understood. For example, particulates do not
cross the placenta (as carbon monoxide does) but may cause an inflammatory response in the

23

mother. Additionally, while a good deal of information has accumulated about the “criterion air
pollutants” that are routinely tracked in the United States because of the Clean Air Acts, much
less information is available about thousands of other toxic chemicals that are in use.
Very little research in any country has tracked the long-term impacts of pollution in any
setting, rich or poor. A few notable exceptions are Nilsson (2009), who finds that in Sweden,
reductions in ambient lead concentrations have positive long-term effects on children’s eventual
educational and labor market outcomes;18 Ferrie et al. (2011), who show that higher exposure in
childhood to water-borne lead reduced test scores for male World War II enlistees; and Almond
et al. (2009), who study the effects of radiation exposure in utero on educational outcomes for
children affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Sweden. In the Chernobyl study, children
exposed to radiation at 8-25 weeks gestation in the most affected municipalities were 4 percent
less likely to qualify for high school.
A final caveat is that even in cases where there is a clearly defined pollution problem,
such as smoke from primitive cooking stoves, the most obvious solutions are not always the most
effective. Hanna et al. (2012) evaluate a large-scale randomized trial in which clean cooking
stoves were introduced to Indian villages. The stoves apparently had little effect on health mainly
because households did not use them. Clearly, much work remains to be done on this topic.
War
Like malnutrition, disease, and pollution, war and exposure to violence threaten health in
the short term. Several studies examine effects on birth and early childhood outcomes. For
example, Mansour and Rees (2012) study the 2000-2005 al-Aqsa Intifada in Palestine using
mother fixed effects models and find that each additional conflict fatality in the first trimester

18

The lead levels Nilsson studies were already less than the U.S. “thresholds for concern” at the beginning of his
sample period, suggesting that even declines from already low levels had positive effects.

24

increases low birth weight by 0.003 percentage points. Camacho (2008) examines data from
Columbia between 1998 and 2003, and also uses mother fixed effects. She finds that exposure to
land mine explosions during the first trimester reduces birth weight by 2.8 grams.
Bundervoet et al. (2009), Akresh et al. (2007), and Akresh et al. (2013) estimate the effect of
early childhood exposure to violence on children’s height-for-age z-scores using a difference-indifference methodology. For example, Bundervoet et al. (2009) exploit variation in civil war
timing across cohorts and provinces in Burundi. They estimate that among children 6 to 60
months, the height-for-age z-score decreased by .047 for each month of exposure to civil war.
A growing literature, reviewed in Table 6, suggests that exposure in early childhood may
also have significant long-term scarring effects. Aguero and Deolalikar (2012) estimate the effect
of childhood exposure to the Rwandan genocide on women’s height-for-age z-scores. Using
difference-in-differences for exposed cohorts with Zimbabwean women as the control group,
they find that Rwandan women exposed to the conflict have 0.2-standard deviations lower
height-for-age z-scores. Taking Akresh and Verwimp (2006) and Aguero and Deolalikar (2012)
together, it appears that the Rwandan civil war greatly affected the height of girls in Rwanda, and
that even exposure late in adolescence affected adult female height.
Several papers evaluate the effects of conflict on years of schooling. Alderman et al.
(2006) combine maternal fixed effects and IV estimation to show that exposure to civil war and
drought shocks in early childhood in Zimbabwe reduced children’s height-for-age z-scores,
which subsequently had negative effects on years of schooling and adult height. Akresh and de
Walque (2008) estimate a difference-in-difference model and find that children exposed to the
Rwandan genocide earned 0.4 fewer years of schooling. In Peru, León (2010) estimates that for
each additional year of civil war exposure in early childhood, children acquired 0.07 fewer years

25

of schooling. Therefore, a child exposed for the first three years of life attains, on average, 0.21
fewer years of schooling. Some of this effect on education may work through the destruction of
school buildings.
Since the exposure occurred in childhood, rather than in utero, the authors posit that the
channel through which the violent event affects height is economic or nutritional. Some authors
also emphasize the possible effects of extreme stress or of being physically unable to attend
school. These types of explanations may also apply to other papers about the effects of exposure
to disaster, such as Sotomayor (2012), who compares Puerto Rican cohorts in utero during the
hurricane years of 1929 and 1933 to surrounding cohorts, finding them more likely to have been
diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes as adults.
War has long been regarded as one of the “four horseman of the apocalypse” suggesting
that people are well aware of its unique capacity for destruction. This new literature does not
help us to distinguish the mechanisms underlying the long-term effects on children, though it
does confirm the long reach of such disastrous events.

4. Discussion and Conclusions
A growing literature shows that events in early life have long-term consequences for
adult health, cognition and labor market success, both in developed and in developing countries.
Still, many basic questions remain unanswered. We still know relatively little about mechanisms.
And it is difficult to say much about the relative magnitudes of the effects of different types of
shocks, nor about possible interactions between them, given data limitations and differences in
methodology across studies.

26

Moreover, while many suggest that critical periods—times in the life of the child when
negative health insults are most harmful—exist, it is generally unclear when these periods are
and to what extent they differ across insults. Much of the recent literature has focused on shocks
sustained in utero. This focus is partly because of the belief that gestation is a critical period, but
also because it is a well-defined period with a distinct beginning and end—unlike, for example,
“early childhood.” The sharp definition facilitates measurement of exposure.
Similarly little evidence is available about possible intergenerational effects, though these
effects represent one of the most intriguing explanations for how the consequences of health
shocks can persist over long periods. Along these lines, Bhalotra and Rawlings (2011) link
mothers in 38 developing countries to infant health and height-for-age z-scores in early childhood. They show that a one-standard deviation decrease in mother’s height is associated with a
7.4 percent increase in the probability that her child is low birth weight and a 9.3 percent higher
neonatal mortality rate. The effects were largest for mothers at the bottom of the income distribution. In a companion paper, (Bhalotra and Rawlings, 2013) they argue that improvements in the
health and educational environment were associated with reductions in these inter-generational
correlations. Although these associations are compelling, they are not obviously causal. Even so,
a follow-up of the INCAP nutritional intervention discussed above provides additional evidence
on intergenerational links. Behrman et al. (2009) show that children born to mothers who received the protein supplement in childhood had babies who were 116 grams heavier and 0.26 zscores taller on average. Furthermore, Fung and Ha (2010) find evidence that the Chinese Great
Famine reduced the heights and weights of survivors’ children.
The fact that events in early childhood have long-term consequences says little about the
extent to which the actions of parents, schools, or other institutions can ameliorate these conse-

27

quences. The extent to which parents reinforce or compensate for early-life shocks is an active
area of research: Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009) find evidence of reinforcement in China, while
Liu et al. (2009) and Bharadwaj et al. (2010) find evidence of compensation in the Philippines
and Chile, respectively. Parents’ decision to compensate or reinforce may depend not only on
beliefs and values but also on the practical supports available to them.
Finally, to our own surprise and chagrin, we find that little research on the impact of
HIV/AIDS on children falls under the scope of our review. Perhaps this omission is due to the
fact that the epidemic so obviously appears to be a catastrophe with long-term impacts for many
children’s lives. It is estimated that more than a quarter-million children under age 15 die of
AIDS-related causes each year, while more than 3 million are currently living with HIV/AIDS,
90 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO 2011). Beyond the direct health impacts,
HIV/AIDS may also have indirect effects through the devastation of families. As of 2003, an
estimated 15 million children had lost at least one parent to AIDS, 80 percent of them in subSaharan Africa (UNAIDS 2004), where research suggests that parental death reduces school
enrollment (Case et al. 2002; Case and Ardington 2006; Evans and Miguel 2007). Many others
have sick caretakers as a result of the virus.
Case and Paxson (2011) make the further important point that the societal response to
disease can impact long-term child outcomes through its effects on health infrastructure. Using
data from fourteen sub-Saharan African countries, they find that in countries heavily impacted by
HIV, skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, and immunization rates declined between 1988 and
2005. Countries with a minimal burden from HIV experienced no such declines. This deterioration, which presumably occurred because of a diversion of health resources to fight the AIDS

28

epidemic, may have lasting effects on children even if neither they nor their parents are HIVpositive.
In sum, research in the past decade has shown that health shocks in early-life have longterm effects on adults in both the developed and developing world. But the literature still has
little understanding of heterogeneity in these effects. Future research should focus on identifying
pathways and mechanisms; measuring the relative magnitudes of the effects of different health
shocks; examining interactions between shocks; and revisiting the question of critical periods.
Beyond these issues, policy-makers have much to learn from new findings on the efficacy of
interventions designed to help children reach their full potential.

Note: All regressions control for gender; the means and standard deviations are standardized for
a sex ratio of one. All standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity; the standard error for the
inverse of the product of the coefficients is computed using the delta method. The British data
are from the National Child Development Study, which followed all British children born in a
single week of 1958. The Philippine data are from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition
Survey, which followed a representative sample of children born in Metropolitan Cebu in 19834. In the Filipino data, birth weight was actually measured at the age of three days; 88 percent
of height measurements occurred at age 21.

Table 2: Associations of Height and Other Adult Outcomes
Study
Author: Behrman
et al. (2009)
Country: Guatemala
Shock: Randomly
assigned high
protein-energy drink and
placebo, two small and
two large villages, 19691977. Earthquake, 1976.

Author: Huang et al.
(2012)
Country: China
Shock: No shock;
associations between
height shrinkage and
SES variables are
explored.

Author: Maurer
(2010)
Country: Barbados,
Mexico, Cuba, Uruguay,
Chile and Brazil
Shock: No shock;
relationship between
cognitive function in
later life and height,
early-life conditions and
education.

Author: Vogl (2012)
Country: Mexico
Shock: No shock; looks
at the skill returns
underlying the labor
market height premium.

Methods
Look at relationship
between cognitive and
health human capital
and labor market
outcomes. OLS and IV:
instrument adult human
capital with variables
reflecting prices and
policies, and individual
and family endowments.
Use upper arm and
lower leg length
measurements to
estimate a pre-shrinkage
height function and
predict pre-shrinkage
heights for an older
population. Use
estimated pre-shrinkage
height and shrinkage as
covariates in OLS
regressions.
Sex specific OLS/Tobit
or 2SLS/IV-Tobit,
depending on whether
height is instrumented
with knee height. Tobit
for potential ceiling
effects (scores only
measure cognitive
function if below the
maximum, otherwise are
a lower bound).

Data/Size

China Health and
Retirement
Longitudinal Study.
Sample is 2,609
people 45-49 (the
“young” sample)
and 5,868 people
60+ (the “old”
sample) in 2011.

Shrinkage and socio-economic variables
such as schooling and household per
capita expenditure are negatively
correlated. Measured height is positively
and significantly associated with all of the
cognition measures. Height shrinkage is
strongly negatively correlated with these
measures, suggesting that part of the
association between measured height and
cognition occurs through height shrinkage.

Survey on Health,
Well-being and
Aging in Latin
America and the
Caribbean in 2000,
representative
urban samples of
persons aged 60+,
7894 obs.

Find a stat. sig. positive association
between height and later-life cognitive
function; larger for women than men.
Significance is lost for men when height is
instrumented, suggesting that for men this
association is partly due to mid- and
later-life circumstances. Adding controls
for childhood conditions doesn’t affect the
height coefﬁcients, but including
education does weaken the association.

OLS/logit of hourly
earnings and occupation
on height, look at
mechanisms by adding
health and childhood
covariates, education
and cognitive test
scores.

Mexican Family
Life Survey, a
nationally
representative
household survey
with waves in 2002
and 2005. Use
individuals 25-65.

An 1 cm increase in height leads to wage
gains of 2.1% (2.9%) for men (women).
Adding cognitive test scores leads to a
17% decrease in the earnings premium to
taller workers, but about half of the
premium can be attributed to these workers
being more educated or having higher
paying jobs (with greater intelligence and
lower strength requirements).

INCAP
longitudinal data
on children born
from 1962- 1977
from a nutritional
supplementation
trial. Children were
followed up in
2002-04. 962 obs.

48

Outcomes
In OLS, find a stat. sig. effect of adult
height and fat-free body mass on wages,
but this disappears in the IV specifications.
Similar results for annual hours and total
income. Only adult cognitive skills are
stat. sig. when both health and cognitive
human capital measures are treated as
endogenous; years of schooling and adult
reading comprehension z-scores are stat.
sig. in both OLS and IV.

who were 20-39 in
1997)

Outcomes
In Uganda, Muslims in utero during
Ramadan are 22% more likely to be
disabled and 2.6% less likely to own a
home. There is no effect on schooling. In
Iraq, Muslims in utero during Ramadan
are 23% more likely to be disabled, 1.4%
less likely to own their own home, and less
likely to be employed.

Examine impact of
prenatal iodine
supplementation on
schooling. District-level
fixed effects regression,
exploiting variation in
program activity (gaps
and delays).

2000 Tanzanian
Household Budget
Survey, children
aged 10-13; 1395
obs.

Distribution of iodine supplements results
in large and stat. sig. increase in
progression through school; children
treated in utero attain 0.35-0.56 years of
additional schooling relative to siblings
and older and younger peers. Girls
consistently benefit more than boys;
consistent with the greater cognitive
sensitivity of female fetuses to maternal
thyroid deprivation.

OLS; look at the
relationship between
exposure to atole or
fresco at specific ages
between 0-7 years and
economic variables.

Data from 60% of
the children (0-7
years) in the
original nutrition
intervention
program, followed
up between 2002
and 2004. 1424
people, aged
25–42.

Exposure to atole before, but not after, age
3 was associated with higher hourly
wages, but only for men. If exposed to
atole from 0-2 years, wages went up by
US$0.67 per hour (a 46% increase). Hours
worked were less and annual incomes
were greater for those exposed to atole
from 0-2, but not stat. sig.

Estimate the effect of
the package of services
on weight-for-age
z-scores by OLS, 2SLS
(instrument actual
receipt with planned
treatment status), and a
combination of
diff-in-diff and
propensity score
matching.

Data from the
program’s two
survey rounds,
2004 and 2006;
children under 5
years old. 10,127
obs.

The impact of planned treatment status on
z-scores is insignificant, as is the impact of
the instrumented intervention; both show a
positive, stat. sig. impact on
weight-for-age z-scores for children who
benefited from the program in utero. The
TOT estimates show z-scores improved by
0.1, while the propensity score matching
estimate shows a larger impact of 0.27.

during late gestation had the highest
prevalence of heart disease (23%). Those
with partial exposure had a lower
prevalence (18%, 15%), and unexposed

genocide as a negative shock that brought
all children to low levels of schooling,
disproportionately affecting boys and
non-poor children, who previously had an
advantage.

Exposure to civil war (drought) decreases
child height-for-age z-score by -0.035 to
-0.049 (-0.576 to -0.729), statistically
significant. Maternal FE-IV regressions:
larger pre-school height associated with
greater attained height in adolescence,
number of grades attained, and (more
weakly) starting school younger.

Abduction leads to a substantial loss of
education (0.78 years, an 11% decrease)
and literacy (17% less likely to be literate).
No impact on probability of employment,
but abductees are half as likely to be in
skilled work. Wages are 22-36% lower.
Psychological distress in those that
experienced the most violence (abducted
or not).
The average person exposed to violence
attained 0.12-0.19 fewer years of
education; for each additional year of civil
war exposure in early childhood, children
acquired 0.07 fewer years of schooling.
The results showed that children can catch
up if they experience violence after
starting their schooling, but if they are
exposed earlier, the effect persists.
