An Anatomy of Credit Booms and their Demise
Enrique G. Mendoza and Marco E. Terrones
NBER Working Paper No. 18379
September 2012
JEL No. E32,E44,E51,G21
ABSTRACT
What are the stylized facts that characterize the dynamics of credit booms and the associated fluctuations
in macro-economic aggregates? This paper answers this question by applying a method proposed in
our earlier work for measuring and identifying credit booms to data for 61 emerging and industrial
countries over the 1960-2010 period. We identify 70 credit boom events, half of them in each group
of countries. Event analysis shows a systematic relationship between credit booms and a boom-bust
cycle in production and absorption, asset prices, real exchange rates, capital inflows, and external deficits.
Credit booms are synchronized internationally and show three striking similarities in industrial and
emerging economies: (1) credit booms are similar in duration and magnitude, normalized by the cyclical
variability of credit; (2) banking crises, currency crises or Sudden Stops often follow credit booms,
and they do so at similar frequencies in industrial and emerging economies; and (3) credit booms often
follow surges in capital inflows, TFP gains, and financial reforms, and are far more common with
managed than flexible exchange rates.

Introduction
Episodes in which credit to the private sector rises significantly above its long-run

trend (i.e. “credit booms”) are often associated with periods of economic turbulence.
Until recently, however, efforts at developing methodologies for identifying credit booms
and characterizing the economic fluctuations that accompany them often produced mixed
results (see, for example, Gourinchas, Valdes, and Landerretche (2001)). In addition,
little was known about the association between economy-wide credit booms and the
financial conditions of individual firms and banks, and about whether the characteristics
of credit booms differ across industrial and emerging economies. This changed with the
growing literature on credit booms developed over the last five years. In particular, in
Mendoza and Terrones (2008) we proposed a new methodology for measuring and
identifying credit booms and showed that it was successful at identifying credit booms
with a clear cyclical pattern in both macro and micro data.
The method we proposed is a “thresholds method.” This method works by first
splitting real credit per capita in each country into its cyclical and trend components, and
then identifying a credit boom as an episode in which credit exceeds its long-run trend by
more than a given “boom” threshold, defined in terms of a tail probability event. The
duration of the boom is similarly set by “starting” and “ending” thresholds. The key
defining feature of this method is that the thresholds are proportional to each country’s
standard deviation of credit over the business cycle. Hence, credit booms reflect countryspecific “unusually large” cyclical credit expansions.
In this paper, we apply this method to data for 61 countries (21 industrial countries,
ICs, and 40 emerging market economies, EMs) over the 1960-2010 period. We found a

1

total of 70 credit booms, 35 in ICs and 35 in EMs, including 16 credit booms that peaked
in the critical period surrounding the recent global financial crisis between 2007 and 2010
(again with about half of these recent booms in ICs and EMs each).1 We then take the
peak dates of all credit booms and construct seven-year event windows around them to
examine the dynamics of macro aggregates in the upswing and downswing of credit
booms. This exercise is similar to the one conducted in our 2008 paper, but the extension
of the sample period to include 2007-2010 is a critical addition because it adds key
evidence from the credit booms that collapsed with the 2008 global financial crisis.
The results show that credit booms are associated with periods of economic
expansion, rising equity and housing prices, real appreciation and widening external
deficits in the upswing phase of the booms, followed by the opposite dynamics in the
downswing. Moreover, credit booms tend to be synchronized internationally and centered
on “big events” like the 1980s debt crisis, the 1992 ERM crisis, the 1990s Sudden Stops,
and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. In addition, splitting our sample into financial crisis
vs. non-crisis cases, we find that booms in the crisis group were larger.
A major deviation in the evidence reported here relative to our previous findings in
Mendoza and Terrones (2008) is that adding the data from the recent credit booms and
crises we find that in fact credit booms in ICs and EMs are more similar than different. In
contrast, in our earlier work we found differences in the magnitude of credit booms, the
size of the macro fluctuations associated with credit booms, and the likelihood that they
are followed by banking or currency crises.

1

For comparison, in Mendoza and Terrones (2008) we had data for 48 countries over the 1960-2006 period
and found 27 credit booms in ICs and 22 in EMs.

2

Credit booms across EMs and ICs are similar in three key respects: First, although
credit booms are larger in EMs (with real credit per capita peaking at about 30 percent
above trend in the median of all EM credit booms v. 12 percent for IC credit booms),
normalizing by each country’s cyclical standard deviation of credit, credit booms are
remarkably uniform in size. The normalized peak of credit booms is about 2 standard
deviations for EMs and 2.1 for ICs. A similar observation applies to the magnitude of the
fluctuations that macro aggregates display during credit booms. These fluctuations are
larger in EMs, but since EMs also display higher cyclical standard deviations in these
variables, normalized fluctuations associated with credit booms are actually similar in
size.2
The second similarity is that, while not all credit booms end in crisis, the peaks of
credit booms are often followed by banking crises, currency crises or Sudden Stops, and
the frequency with which this happens is about the same for EMs and ICs (20 to 25
percent for banking and currency crises, 14 percent for Sudden Stops). This is a critical
change from our previous findings, because lacking the substantial evidence from all the
recent booms and crises, we had found only 9 percent frequency of banking crises after
credit booms for EMs and zero for ICs, and 14 percent frequency of currency crises after
credit booms for EMs v. 31 percent for ICs. Clearly, the larger sample of credit boom
events used here yields a different picture indicating that in the aftermath of credit booms
both groups of countries suffer both types of crises, and also Sudden Stop crises, with
about the same frequency.

2

Mendoza (1995) documents a similar finding for regular business cycle indicators in a sample of 23
developing countries and 7 ICs. Standard deviations of cyclical components of macro aggregates are
significantly higher for developing countries than for ICs, but normalized by the standard deviation of the
terms of trade, the variability of macro variables is similar across all countries.

3

The third similarity relates to the factors that can act as potential triggers of credit
booms. In particular, surges in capital inflows, gains in total factor productivity (TFP),
policy reforms in the financial system, and managed exchange rates all play a role in both
ICs and EMs. There are some differences across the two groups, because the frequency of
credit booms in EMs is 47 percent when preceded by periods of large capital inflows (v.
33 percent in ICs) and 30 percent for financial reforms (v. 22 percent for ICs), while TFP
gains precede credit booms with a frequency of 42 percent for ICs (v. 20 percent for
EMs). But the overall message is that these three factors precede the peak of credit booms
with a frequency of roughly 1/5 to 1/2. Moreover, credit booms in both ICs and EMs are
far more frequent in the presence of fixed or managed exchange rates (with a frequency
of about 2/3rds for all countries), than under floating or dirty floating regimes (with
frequencies ranging from 3 to 20 percent).
Our work is related to the empirical literature that identifies booms in macro variables
using threshold methods and event-study techniques. Montiel’s (2000) analysis of
consumption booms was one of the first studies in this vein. Gourinchas et al. (2001)
introduced threshold methods to the analysis of credit booms, followed by several other
studies including Cottarelli, et. al. (2003), International Monetary Fund (2004), Hilberts,
et. al. (2005), and Ottens, et. al. (2005).3 Threshold methods have also been widely used
in related studies of Sudden Stops and the boom-bust cycle of capital inflows. Reinhart
and Reinhart (2009) survey this literature and conduct a detailed cross-country analysis of
the macroeconomic dynamics associated with surges in capital inflows. In line with our

3

There are also other studies that examine linkages between credit and macro variables without measuring
credit booms (e.g. Collyns and Senhadji (2002), Borio, et. al. (2001), and Kraft and Jankov (2005)).

4

findings, they find that booms in capital inflows are associated with periods of economic
expansion and booming credit and asset prices.
Before our 2008 working paper provided a new methodology to measure credit
booms, the standard practice in empirical studies on this topic followed the method
proposed by Gourinchas et al (2001). There are three important differences between their
method and ours: (1) we use real credit per capita instead of the credit-output ratio as the
measure of credit; (2) we construct the trend of credit using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter in its standard form, instead of using an “expanding HP trend” (see Mendoza and
Terrones (2008) for details); and (3) we use thresholds that depend on each country’s
cyclical variability of credit, instead of a threshold common to all countries.4
These differences have important implications. As shown in Mendoza and Terrones
(2008), an example of both methods applied to Chilean data shows that the method of
Gourinchas et al. (2001) is not robust to the choice of credit measure, and that it treats
each period’s credit observation as unduly representative of its trend (because it models
the long-run trend of credit as a smoothed, lagged approximation of the actual data).
Moreover, the two methods yield sharply different predictions about the association
between macro variables and credit booms. In particular, we find that output,
consumption and investment rise significantly above trend during the expansionary phase
of credit booms, and fall below trend during the contractionary phase. In contrast, they
found weak evidence of cycles in output and absorption associated with credit booms.
We also find a clear association between credit booms and financial crises, while they

4

Our study also differs in that we examine credit booms in industrial countries, and study differences in the
dynamics of the tradables v. nontradables sectors.

5

found that the likelihood of financial crises does not increase significantly when credit
booms are present.
Our work is also related to the analysis of the credit transmission channel in twin
banking-currency crises by Tornell and Westermann (2005).5 These authors document
that twin crises are preceded by rising credit-GDP ratios, increases in output of
nontradables relative to tradables, and real appreciations, followed by declines in all of
these variables. In addition, they used the World Bank’s World Business Economic
Survey (WBES) to document asymmetries in the access to credit markets of firms in the
tradables v. non-tradables sectors. We also look at sectoral differences in the evolution of
output dynamics, but our approach differs in that we examine these dynamics conditional
on credit boom episodes, rather than conditional on being on a twin-crises event.
Our frequency analysis of the association of credit booms with capital inflows,
financial reforms, and TFP gains is related to theoretical and empirical studies on the
mechanisms that drive credit booms. These include theories in which excessive credit
expansion is due to herding behavior by banks (Kindleberger (2000)); information
problems that lead to bank-interdependent lending policies (Rajan (1994) and Gorton and
He (2005)), the underestimation of risks (Boz and Mendoza (2011) and Borio, et. al.
(2001)) and the lowering of lending standards (Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2006)); the
presence of explicit or implicit government guarantees (Corsetti, et. al. (1999)); or limited
commitment on the part of borrowers (Lorenzoni (2005)). Similarly, our analysis of the
connection between credit booms and macroeconomic activity is related to the literature
on business cycle models that incorporate “financial accelerators,” by which shocks to

5

Tornell and Westermann also study the extent financial market imperfections influences the cycle in the
middle income countries during tranquil times. See also Scheneider and Tornell (2004).

6

asset prices and relative good prices are amplified through balance sheet effects (see, for
example, Fisher (1933), Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist
(1999), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), and Mendoza (2005) and (2010)).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our method for
identifying credit booms, implements it using our cross-country sample, and examines
the main characteristics of credit booms in industrial and emerging economies. Section 3
studies the credit-boom dynamics of the cyclical components of macro aggregates.
Section 4 concludes.

Credit Booms: Methodology and Key Features

2.1

Methodology
A credit boom is defined in general as an episode in which credit to the private sector

grows by more than during a typical business cycle expansion. In Mendoza and Terrones
(2008) we formalized this definition as follows. Denote the deviation from the long-run
trend in the logarithm of real credit per capita in country i, date t as lit, and the
corresponding standard deviation of this cyclical component as  (li ) . The long-run trend
is calculated using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with the smoothing parameter set at
100, as is typical for annual data. Country i is defined to have experienced a credit boom
when we identify one or more contiguous dates for which the credit boom condition

li ,t   (li ) holds, where  is the boom threshold factor. Thus, during a credit boom the
deviations from trend in credit exceed the typical expansion of credit over the business
cycle by a factor of  or more. The baseline value of  is set at 1.65, because the 5
percent tail of the standardized normal distribution satisfies Prob( li ,t /  (li )  1.65 )=0.05.

7

We also conducted sensitivity analysis for  = 1.5 and 2 and confirmed that our main
results are robust to the value of .
The date of the peak of the credit boom ( tˆ ) is the date that shows the maximum
difference between lit and   (li ) from the set of contiguous dates that satisfy the credit
boom condition. Given tˆ , the starting date of the credit boom is a date ts such that ts < tˆ
and ts yields the smallest difference | li ,t   s (li ) | , and the ending date te is a date te > tˆ
that yields the smallest difference | li ,t   e (li ) | , where s and e are the start and end
thresholds.6 We use baseline values s=e =1, and we also tried other values including 0,
¼, ½ and ¾.7 Once the starting and ending dates are set, the duration of the credit boom is
given by the difference te – ts.
2.2

Credit boom episodes and their main features
We use data on credit from the financial sector to the private non-financial sector

obtained from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics for a sample of 61 countries,
21 industrial and 40 emerging economies (see Appendix 1), for the 1960-2010 period.
Our measure of credit is the sum of claims on the private sector by deposit money banks
(IFS line 22d) plus, whenever available for the entire sample period for a given country,
claims on the private sector by other financial institutions (IFS line 42d). Real credit per
capita is calculated as the end-of-year observations of nominal credit per capita deflated
by their corresponding end-of-year consumer price index. Data sources for these and all
other variables used in the paper are listed in Appendix 2.

6

These threshold conditions are set to minimize the absolute values of differences of lit relative to targets
because the data are discrete, and hence in general lit does not match the targets with equality.
7
We use thresholds such that s =e < , but notice that in principle s and e could differ, and one or both
could be set equal to .

8

We identified 70 credit booms in our data, 35 in ICs and 35 in EMs.8 Figure 1
provides a summary view of these credit booms by plotting the cross-country mean and
median of the cyclical components of real credit per capita in seven-year event windows
centered at the peak of credit booms for the two groups of countries. These graphs show
that credit booms in EMs are larger than in industrial countries in absolute terms: At the
peak of the booms, the average expansion in real credit per capita reached about 30
percent above trend in EMs, twice what is observed in ICs. Normalized by the standard
deviation of the cyclical component of credit in each country, however, credit booms in
the two groups of countries show a similar distribution, with medians of 2 and 2.1 for
ICs and EMs respectively (see Figure 2). Thus, normalized by the variability of credit,
the magnitude of credit booms does not differ significantly across EMs and ICs.
Table 1 shows the duration of credit booms for different starting and ending
thresholds, and the length of the corresponding upswing and downswing phases. In
general, the results based on medians indicate that EMs and ICs show booms with
similar duration of about 3-6 years, and the fraction of the boom spent in the upswing
and downswing phases with the duration thresholds set at 1 is about the same. Using
means, however, EMs seem to show longer and more asymmetric booms.
Credit booms tend to be clustered geographically and not limited to a single region:
40 percent of the booms experienced by emerging economies were observed in East Asia
and 32 percent in Latin America. Likewise, 33 percent of the credit booms in industrial
countries were observed in the G7 and 18 percent in the Nordic countries (Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden). In addition, Figure 3 shows that credit booms tend to be
8

There is also one emerging economy (Hong Kong) identified as experiencing credit booms in 2010, the
end of the sample period. We excluded it from the event analysis because this boom has yet to be
completed (i.e. the ending threshold has not been crossed yet).

synchronized internationally and centered around big events—e.g. the Bretton Woods
collapse of the early 1970s, the petro dollars boom in the prelude to the 1980s debt crisis,
the ERM and Nordic country crises of the early 1990s, the 1990s Sudden Stops, and the
recent Global Financial Crisis. It is interesting to note that excluding the recent crisis, the
Figure would have misleadingly suggested that the frequency of credit booms in ICs had
declined over time. Adding the turbulent period of the past few years it is clear that this
is not the case. Still, it is possible that the credit measure from IFS misses important
elements of the securitization boom occurring via non-bank financial intermediaries, and
thus lead us to underestimate the magnitude and frequency of credit booms in countries
with more developed financial systems. 9

Credit Booms and Macroeconomic Dynamics

This Section examines the business cycle behavior of the economy during credit
boom events, and conducts a frequency analysis of the association between credit booms
and financial crises, and between credit booms and some of their potential determinants.
3.1

Event analysis
We construct seven-year event windows of the cyclical components of macro

aggregates centered on the peak of credit booms (i.e. tˆ is normalized to date t=0). The
windows show the cross-country means and medians of output (Y), private consumption
(C), public consumption (G), investment (I), the output of nontradables (YN), the real
exchange rate (RER), the current account-output ratio (CAY) and total capital inflows as
share of output (KI). All these variables are at constant prices, expressed in per-capita

9

For example, Rajan (2005) argues that technical change, deregulation, and institutional change have
resulted in an increasing number of arm’s length transactions away from banks in the financial system.
Indeed, the growing securitization of subprime mortgages in the United States in recent years was
accompanied by an increase in the off-balance sheet operations of bank entities.

10

terms and detrended with the HP filter setting the smoothing parameter at 100, except for
RER (which is not in per-capita terms) and the current account-output and capital
inflows-output ratios (which are at current prices and not expressed in per capita terms).
Figures 4-8 illustrate business cycle dynamics around credit boom episodes in EMs
and ICs. Except for RER in the EMs group, there is little difference in the dynamics
produced by country means and medians, indicating that the results are not driven by
outliers. Consider first the plots for EMs in the right-side of the Figures. Y, C and G rise 2
to 5 percentage points above trend in the build up phase of the credit boom, and drop to
between 2 to 3.5 percent below trend in the recessive phase. I, YN and RER follow a
similar pattern but display significantly larger expansions and recessions. Investment
rises up to about 20 percent above trend at the peak of credit booms and drops below
trend by a similar amount by t=2. YN rises to about 5½ percent above trend by t=0 and
then drops to almost 4 percent below trend by t=3. The median RER appreciates 7 percent
above trend at date t, and drops to a low of about 4 percent below trend when the credit
boom unwinds. CAY displays the opposite pattern: it declines to a deficit of about 2
percentage points of GDP in the expanding phase of the boom and then rises to a surplus
of 1 percentage point of GDP in the declining phase. In line with these current account
dynamics, the median KI rises by up to 2 percentage points of GDP by t=-1 and then
drops by 1 percentage point of GDP by t=2.
The plots for industrial countries in the left-side panels of Figures 4-8 show several
similarities with those for emerging economies, but also some important differences.
Output, expenditures and the current account in the industrial countries follow a cyclical
pattern similar to that observed in the emerging economies, but the amplitude of these

11

fluctuations is smaller (particularly for YN and RER), and government consumption
shows a different pattern (just about at trend in the expanding phase and slightly above
trend in the contraction phase). However, if we were to normalize the macro data using
standard deviations of cyclical components, and take into account that EMs display
higher business cycle variability in all their macro-aggregates (see, for example,
Mendoza (1995)), we would see again that credit booms display similar features across
EMs and ICs.
Two important caveats apply to the event study graphs of macro dynamics. First, they
illustrate the cyclical dynamics of macro variables, but do not show if these variables
themselves are undergoing a boom (i.e. an unusually large expansion as defined by our
thresholds method). Table 2 provides evidence to examine this issue by listing the
fraction of credit booms associated with booms in output and expenditures that occur in
any year inside the seven-year window of the credit boom events. The results show that
between 30 to 60 percent of the credit booms are associated with booms in Y, YN, C, I,
and G, and this holds for EMs and ICs separately and for all the countries together. For
output, in particular, close to half of the observed credit booms are associated with output
booms, with little difference across EMs and ICs.
The second caveat is that the macro event windows show point estimates of measures
of central tendency (means and medians), but do not demonstrate if these moments are
statistically significant. To explore this issue, we run cross-section regressions of each
macro variable for each date of the event window on a constant. The standard error for
the median (mean) is obtained using quintile (OLS) regressions. As Table 3 shows, most
of the mean and median estimates shown in the event study plots for Y, YN, C, and I are

12

statistically significant. For G, RER and CA/Y, however, many of the coefficients have
large standard errors.
We now study the behavior of inflation, equity prices and housing prices during credit
booms (see Figure 8). Using medians, there is only a week association between credit
booms and inflation in both EMs and ICs, with below-trend inflation in the upswing and
above-trend inflation in the downswing.10 Hence, credit booms are generally not
associated with sharp changes in inflation. In contrast, housing and equity prices show a
clear pattern of rising prices in the upswing and declining prices in the downswing.
Equity prices rise to 25-30 percent at the peak of credit booms, and housing prices rise to
10-15 percent in both EMs and ICs. The downswing of credit booms leads to significant
equity price collapses of about 20 percent in real terms in both groups of countries. These
movements in asset prices are important because they are consistent with theoretical
explanations of credit booms and busts that rely on financial accelerators and balance
sheet effects.
Real M2 money balances also expand during the upswing and contract during the
downswing of credit booms (see Figure 7). This suggests that monetary policy may play
a role in fueling credit booms, inasmuch as real M2 moves along with credit during credit
boom episodes. 11

10

The mean inflation in EMs does show a shift from sharply below-trend inflation to sharply above-trend
inflation but that reflects outliers driven by a few hyperinflation episodes in Latin America.
11
There is the impression that central banks in developing countries often loosen (tighten) monetary policy
in good (bad) times. However, a systemic characterization of this regularity has been elusive because of
lack of good indicators of the monetary policy stance (see, for instance, Kaminsky, Reinhart and Vegh,
2005).

13

The event windows for industrial and emerging economies mask important variations
across country regions. In ICs, the Nordic countries show larger fluctuations in credit and
in the macro variables than the G7 (Table 4, Panel A). In addition, some of the macro
variables in the Nordic countries peak earlier than credit. In the case of EMs (Table 4,
Panel B), credit expansions and the associated surge in consumption are much larger in
Latin America. In contrast, the current account reversals when the credit booms revert are
larger in Asia.
In summary, the macro event study shows that credit booms across emerging and
industrial economies are associated with a well-defined pattern of economic expansion in
the build-up phase of the booms, followed by contraction in the declining phase. Output,
expenditures, stock prices, housing prices, and the real exchange rate move above trend
in the first phase, and drop below trend in the second phase, and the current account falls
first and then rises. All of this happens without major changes in inflation in most
countries.
There are interesting differences in the dynamics around credit boom events across
EMs and ICs in terms of the amplitude of macro fluctuations in levels (i.e. without some
form of normalization) and in the dynamics of government expenditures. These
differences are consistent with three well-known facts in international business cycle
studies: First, as noted earlier, the larger amplitude of the fluctuations displayed by EMs
is in line with well-established evidence showing that business cycles are larger in
developing countries (see Mendoza (1995), Kose, Prasad and Terrones (2003), Neumeyer
and Perri (2005)). Second, the striking difference in the behavior of government
purchases is consistent with the evidence produced in the literature on the procyclicality

14

of fiscal policy in EMs (see Kaminski, Reinhart, and Vegh (2005)). Third, the widening
current account deficits followed by reversals, and the larger booms followed by
collapses in the price and output of the nontradables sector, are consistent with
observations highlighted in the Sudden Stops literature (e.g. Calvo (1998), Mendoza
(2007), Caballero and Krishnamurty (2001)). However, it is important to note that
generally these facts have been documented by examining macroeconomic data without
conditioning for credit booms. In contrast, our results apply specifically to fluctuations
associated with credit boom episodes. This is particularly relevant for the Sudden Stop
facts (i.e. the reversals in CAY and the boom-bust cycles in RER and YN), because most
of the Sudden Stops literature emphasizes the role of credit transmission mechanisms in
explaining Sudden Stops.
Our finding that credit booms are associated with a well-defined cyclical pattern in
output and expenditures contrasts sharply with the findings of Gourinchas et al. (2001),
showing only ambiguous evidence of this association. Figure 6 in their paper shows a
small cycle in GDP, a decline in GDP growth below trend for the entire duration of credit
booms, and no cycle in consumption.
3.3

Frequency analysis
We conduct next a frequency analysis to examine three issues: (1) the association

between credit booms and financial crises; (2) the role of capital inflows, TFP gains,
financial reforms and exchange rate regimes as preconditions of credit booms; and (3) the
probability of experiencing a credit boom once the starting threshold is crossed.
Credit booms are often cited as the culprit behind financial crises, particularly in
emerging economies (see Eichengreen and Arteta, 2002). If this is the case, credit booms

15

should be closely associated with financial crises. Table 5 shows the percent of banking
crises, currency crises and Sudden Stops that occurred during the seven-year window of
the credit boom events in EMs, ICs and all countries combined. The percent of crises that
occurred before, at, and after the peak of the credit booms are listed in separate columns.
The dates identifying the occurrence of these crises were obtained from sources in the
empirical literature (Demirguic-Kunt and Detragiache (2006) for banking crises,
Eichengreen and Bordo (2002) for currency crises, and Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejia
(2004) for Sudden Stops).
Table 5 yields an important result: Credit booms in both EMs and ICs are often
associated with currency crises, banking crises, and Sudden Stops, although the first two
are observed more often than the third. Banking crises are observed in 44 percent of all
credit booms, in about 1/3rd of IC credit booms and ½ of EM credit booms. Currency
crises are observed in 54 percent of all credit booms, in 44 percent of IC credit booms
and 2/3rds of EM credit booms. Sudden Stops are observed in about ¼ of all credit
booms, in 14 percent of IC credit booms and 1/3rd of EM credit booms.
It is also worth noting that, within the seven-year window of credit boom events, the
incidence of the three types of crises is at its highest after credit booms peak, and this
holds again for EMs, ICs and all countries combined. Moreover, the frequency with
which each type of crisis is observed after the peak of credit booms is also very similar
across EMs and ICs (23 v. 25 percent for banking crises, 20 v. 25 percent for currency
crises and a common 14 percent for Sudden Stops). Thus, clearly not all credit booms end
in crisis, but odds are about 1 out of 4 that once a country enters a credit boom it will end
with a currency or a banking crisis, and a little less that it will end in a Sudden Stop.

16

These findings are broadly consistent with those reported in Schularick and Taylor
(2012). They examined whether credit growth is a significant predictor of banking crises
for a sample of fourteen developed countries over the 1870 to 2008 period, and found that
indeed credit growth helps predict these crises. However, their analysis provides only
indirect evidence of the credit boom-bust cycle because using credit growth per-se as
explanatory variable does not identify whether this credit growth is the result of financial
deepening or a credit boom.
Our findings are at odds with the conclusion in Gourinchas et al. (2001), which noted
that there is virtually no association between credit booms and financial crises in EMs,
They are also sharply different from the findings in Mendoza and Terrones (2008), where
lacking the data from 2007-2010 we found that credit booms in ICs were rarely
associated with banking and currency crises, and there was no association with Sudden
Stops.
We also constructed seven-year event windows that compare the fluctuations in credit
and macro aggregates of countries that experienced a crisis (i.e. banking crisis, currency
crisis, or Sudden Stop) with those that did not. The results (available from the authors on
request) show clearly that the macro fluctuations in the countries that experienced crisis
are larger and display more abrupt declines than those of the non-crisis countries. In
particular, the dynamics of credit are more pronounced and with more drastic
downswings in the case of the crisis countries than in the non-crisis countries. In
addition, the behavior of capital inflows is different across the two groups of countries.
While capital inflows rise in the upswing of the crisis episodes and fall abruptly in the
downswing, they seem more stable in the case of the non-crisis episodes.

17

Consider now the frequency analysis of the association between credit booms and
large capital inflows, financial reforms, and TFP gains. Capital inflows are measured as
the total net inflows (i.e. net foreign direct investment, net portfolio flows, and other net
investments liabilities) in percent of GDP, using data from IFS (see Appendix 2). We
define a state of large capital inflows as of date t when the preceding three-year average
of net capital inflows ranked on the top quartile of its respective country group (i.e. EMs,
ICs, or both) over the 1975-2010 period. Domestic financial reforms are measured using
the index produced by Abiad, Detragiache, and Tressel (2007). This index takes values
between 0 and 21 and includes information on reserve requirements and credit controls,
interest rate controls, barriers to entry, state ownership, policies on securities markets,
banking regulation, and capital account restrictions. We identify a country undertaking
significant financial reforms as of date t if the preceding three-year change in this index
ranks on the top quartile of its respective country group over the 1975-2005 period. Our
measure of TFP is based on standard growth accounting methods (see, for instance,
Klenow and Rodriguez (1997) and Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2008)), using labor and
investment data from PWT 7.0 and educational attainment levels from Barro and Lee
(2010). A country is identified to have experienced high TFP growth as of date t if the
preceding three-year average of TFP growth ranked on the top quartile of its respective
group over the 1975-2010 period.
Table 6 shows the fraction of credit booms preceded by large capital inflows, large
TFP gains and domestic financial reforms. In the case of ICs, 42 percent of the credit
booms followed large TFP gains, 33 percent followed large capital inflows and 22
percent followed significant financial reforms. In contrast, in EMs we find that almost 1/2

18

of credit booms were preceded by large capital inflows and 30 percent by financial
reforms, while TFP gains play a smaller role than in ICs, with a frequency of 20 percent.
These results indicate that surges in capital inflows are a good predictor of credit booms
in both ICs and EMs,12 while in ICs large TFP gains are also a good predictor but
financial reforms less so, and the opposite holds for EMs.
Table 7 shows the results of a similar frequency analysis but now aimed at examining
the association between the peak of credit booms and the exchange rate regimes in place
the preceding three years. We use Reinhart and Rogoff’s (2004) classification of
exchange rate regimes to create the following four regime groupings: fixed and managed,
dirty floating, floating and mixed (see the footnote to Table 7 for details). The mixed
regime includes countries that switched across the other regimes in any of the three years
prior to the peak of the credit boom. The results shown in Table 7 are striking: about 70
percent of the credit booms occur in countries with managed or fixed exchange rate
regimes, and this holds for ICs, EMs, and all countries combined.13
Finally, we use frequency analysis to determine the probability that a country will
experience a credit boom once it has crossed the starting threshold. This probability can
be a useful “early warning” indicator for surveillance of credit market conditions. We
considered starting thresholds of ½ and 1 standard deviations of the cyclical component
of our credit measure, and computed the probabilities for ICs, EMs and all countries
combined. Once a starting threshold of 1 (½) standard deviation of the cyclical position

12

In terms of the composition of the inflows, net portfolio and debt inflows stand out as the most important
for ICs, while net foreign direct investment and net bank flows are the most significant for EMs.
13
In a related paper, Magud, Reinhart and Vesperoni, 2011, study the effects of exchange rate flexibility on
credit expansions during episodes of large capital inflows in the emerging economies. They report evidence
suggesting that countries with less flexible exchange rates often experience significant credit expansions
during surges in capital inflows; thus, becoming more vulnerable to capital flow reversals.

19

of credit is crossed, the probability of a credit boom is 13 (8) percent for EMs, 23 (14)
percent for ICs, and 17 (10) percent for all countries combined. Naturally, these
probabilities are lower with the lower starting threshold, as it is less likely that the
cyclical expansion of credit turns into a credit boom. The probabilities are higher for ICs
than for EMs, indicating that having crossed the starting threshold is a more precise
predictor of credit booms in the former than in the latter.
4. Conclusions

This paper used a thresholds method to identify and measure credit booms in
industrial and emerging economies, and conducted an event study analysis of the
dynamics of macro aggregates during credit booms. We identified 70 credit booms in a
sample of 61 countries with data for the 1960-2010 period, with half of the credit booms
in industrial countries and half in emerging economies. The upswing of these booms is
associated with economic expansions, rising equity and housing prices, real currency
appreciation, and widening external deficits, followed by the opposite dynamics in the
downswing. Moreover, credit booms tend to be synchronized internationally and centered
on “big events” like the 1980s debt crisis, Sudden Stops in emerging economies and the
2008 Global Financial Crisis.
Credit booms display three striking similarities across industrial and emerging
economies: (1) credit booms normalized by the cyclical variability of credit are similar in
magnitude across both groups of countries; (2) banking crises, currency crises or Sudden
Stops often follow credit booms, and the frequencies with which they do are similar
across industrial and emerging economies; and (3) credit booms often follow surges in
capital inflows, TFP gains, and financial reforms, and are far more common with

20

managed than flexible exchange rates. These results differ significantly from previous
findings in the literature on credit booms suggesting an ambiguous relationship between
credit booms and economic expansions, and little or no association between financial
crises and credit booms (see Gourinchas et al. (2001)). They are also different from the
findings of our previous work (Mendoza and Terrones (2008), which used data until 2006
and reported differences across industrial and emerging economy booms in the above
three characteristics that we now find them similar.
The results of our study have important implications for the analysis of macro-finance
linkages, and for surveillance of financial systems and their macroeconomic effects.
From the policy perspective, the thresholds method we proposed provides a tractable
framework for measuring and identifying credit booms that are closely associated with
cyclical fluctuations in macro aggregates and key financial indicators of corporations and
banks. Our results show that credit booms can be identified by the size of a credit
expansion relative to trend, and that this information can be supplemented with other
indicators of excessive credit growth: such as booms in output and expenditures,
excessive real appreciation and/or expansion of the nontradables sector, large inflows of
foreign capital and fast TFP growth or domestic financial reforms,. Moreover, our results
also highlight the importance of using corrective policy actions to prevent credit booms,
because the declining phase of credit booms is associated with recessions and a higher
incidence of financial crises.
From the perspective of research on macro-finance linkages, our results provide a set
of robust empirical regularities that can guide research on models of “credit transmission”
by providing the set of facts that these models should aim to explain. These empirical

21

regularities are reflected in a strong association of credit booms with booms in output and
expenditures, rising asset prices, widening external deficits and sharp real appreciations.

A situation in which at least one of the following conditions holds: (1) the ratio of nonperforming assets to total asses of the banking sector exceeds 10 percent; (2) the cost
of banking system bailouts exceeds 2 percent of GDP; (3) there is a large scale bank
nationalization as result of banking sector problems; and (4) there are bank runs or new
important depositor protection measures.
A situation in which a country experiences a forced change in parity, abandons a
currency peg or receives a bailout from an international organization, and at the same
time an index of exchange rae market pressure (a weighted average of the depreciation
rate, change in short-term interest rate, and percentage change in reserves) rises
1.5 standard deviations above its mean.
A situation in which a country experiences a year-on-year fall in capital flows that
exceeds 2 standard deviations relative to the mean.

The index captures changes in seven financial policy dimensions:
(1) credit controls and reserve requirements; (2) Interest rate controls; (3) Entry
barriers; (4) State ownership in the banking sector; (5) Capital account restrictions;
(6) Prudential regulations and supervision of the banking sector; and (7) Securities
market policy. The index is just the sum of these seven dimensions(each of wich can
take values between 0 and 3) and takes values between 0 (the lowest) and 21
(the highest).
