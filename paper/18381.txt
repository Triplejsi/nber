ABSTRACT
We provide explicit solutions for government spending multipliers during a liquidity trap and within
a fixed exchange regime using standard closed and open-economy models. We confirm the potential
for large multipliers during liquidity traps. For a currency union, we show that self-financed multipliers
are small, always below unity. However, outside transfers or windfalls can generate larger responses
in out- put, whether or not they are spent by the government. Our solutions are relevant for local and
national multipliers, providing insight into the economic mechanisms at work as well as the testable
implications of these models.

We provide explicit solutions for government spending multipliers during a liquidity
trap and within a fixed exchange regime using standard closed and open-economy
models. We confirm the potential for large multipliers during liquidity traps. For
a currency union, we show that self-financed multipliers are small, always below
unity. However, outside transfers or windfalls can generate larger responses in output, whether or not they are spent by the government. Our solutions are relevant
for local and national multipliers, providing insight into the economic mechanisms at
work as well as the testable implications of these models.

Introduction

Economists generally agree that macroeconomic stabilization should be handled first and
foremost by monetary policy. Yet monetary policy can run into constraints that impair its
effectiveness. For example, the economy may find itself in a liquidity trap, where interest rates hit zero, preventing further reductions in the interest rate. Similarly, countries
that belong to currency unions, or states within a country, do not have the option of an
independent monetary policy. Some economists advocate for fiscal policy to fill this void,
increasing government spending to stimulate the economy. Others disagree, and the issue remains deeply controversial, as evidenced by vigorous debates on the magnitude of
fiscal multipliers. No doubt, this situation stems partly from the lack of definitive empirical evidence, but, in our view, the absence of clear theoretical benchmarks also plays an
important role. Although various recent contributions have substantially furthered our
understanding, to date, the implications of standard macroeconomic models have not
been fully worked out. This is the goal of our paper.
1

We solve for the response of the economy to changes in the path for government
spending during liquidity traps or within currency unions using standard closed and
open-economy monetary models. A number of features distinguish our approach and
contribution. First, our approach departs from existing literature by focusing on fiscal
multipliers that encapsulate the effects of spending for any path for government spending, instead of solving for a particular multiplier associated with the expansion of a single
benchmark path for spending. Doing so provides insight into the economic mechanism
for the effects and delivers results on the varying effectiveness in the timing—back loading versus front loading—for stimulus plans. Second, we obtain simple closed-form solutions for these multipliers. These help uncover the precise mechanisms underlying the
effects of fiscal policy and allow us to deliver several new results. Third, we investigate a
sharp contrast between the liquidity trap and currency union cases. We isolate the crucial
role that outside transfers can play and we compute the corresponding transfer multipliers. Finally, we consider non-Ricardian effects by studying a version of the model with
liquidity constrained consumers. This extension may be especially relevant for the recent downturn, which is widely associated with a sharp disruption in financial and credit
markets, followed by a slow recovery featuring household deleveraging. Throughout, we
draw implications for recent empirical studies on national and local multipliers.
Our results confirm that fiscal policy can be especially potent during a liquidity trap.
The multiplier for output is greater than one. The mechanism for this result is that government spending promotes inflation. With fixed nominal interest rates, this reduces real
interest rates which increases current spending. The increase in consumption in turn leads
to more inflation, creating a feedback loop. The fiscal multiplier is increasing in the degree of price flexibility, which is intuitive given that the mechanism relies on the response
of inflation. We show that backloading spending leads to larger effects; the rationale is
that inflation then has more time to affect spending decisions.
In a currency union, by contrast, government spending is less effective at increasing output. We show that consumption is depressed, so that the multiplier is less than
one. Moreover, price flexibility diminishes the effectiveness of spending, instead of increasing it. We explain this result using a simple argument that illustrates its robustness.
Government spending leads to inflation in domestically produced goods and this loss
in competitiveness depresses private spending. Applied to current debates in Europe,
this highlights a possible tradeoff: putting off fiscal consolidation may postpone internal
devaluations that actually help reactivate private spending.
It may seem surprising that fiscal multipliers are necessarily less than one whenever
the exchange rate is fixed, because this contrasts sharply with the effects during liquidity
2

traps. Our analytical approach allows us to uncover the crucial difference in monetary
policy: although a fixed exchange rate implies a fixed nominal interest rate, the converse
is not true. Indeed, we prove that the liquidity trap analysis implicitly combines a shock
to government spending with a one-off devaluation. The positive response of consumption relies entirely on this devaluation. A currency union rules out such devaluations,
explaining the negative response of consumption.
In the context of a currency union, our results uncover the importance of transfers
from the outside, from other countries or regions. In the short run, when prices haven’t
fully adjusted, positive transfers from the rest of the world increase the demand for home
goods, stimulating output. We compute “transfer multipliers” that capture the response
of the economy to transfers from the outside. We show that these multipliers may be large
and depend crucially on the degree of openness of the domestic economy.
Outside transfers are often tied to government spending. In the United States federal
military spending allocated to a particular state is financed by the country as a whole.
The same is true for exogenous differences in stimulus payments, due to idiosyncratic
provisions in the law. Likewise, idiosyncratic portfolio returns accruing to a particular
state’s coffers represent a windfall for this state against the rest. When changes in spending are financed by such outside transfers, the associated multipliers are a combination
of self-financed multipliers and transfer multipliers. As a result, multipliers may be substantially larger than one.
Finally, we explore non-Ricardian effects from fiscal policy by introducing hand-tomouth consumers. We think of this as a tractable way of modeling liquidity constraints.
In both in a liquidity trap and in a currency union, government spending now has an
additional stimulative effect. It increases the income and consumption of hand-to-mouth
agents. This effects is largest when spending is deficit financed; indeed, the effects may
in some cases depend entirely on deficits, not spending per se. Overall, although hand
to mouth consumers introduce an additional effect most of our conclusions, such as the
comparison of fiscal multipliers in a liquidity trap and a currency union, are unaffected.
Related literature. Our paper is related to several strands of theoretical and empirical
literatures. We will discuss those that are most closely related.
We contribute to the literature that studies fiscal policy in the New Keynesian model
in liquidity traps. Eggertsson (2011), Woodford (2011), Christiano et al. (2011), show that
fiscal multipliers can be large at the zero lower bound, while Werning (2012) studies optimal government spending with and without commitment to monetary policy. Gali and
Monacelli (2008) study optimal fiscal policy in a currency union, but they conduct an
3

exclusively normative analysis and do not compute fiscal multipliers. The results and
simulations reported in Corsetti et al. (2011), Nakamura and Steinsson (2011), and Erceg
and Linde (2012) show that fiscal multipliers are generally below one under fixed exchange rates yet higher than under flexible exchange rates (away from the zero bound),
somewhat validating the conventional Mundell-Flemming view that fiscal policy is more
effective with fixed exchange rates (see e.g. Dornbusch, 1980). Our solutions extend these
results and help sharpen the intuition for them, by discussing the role of implicit devaluations and transfers. Gali, Lopez-Salido and Valles (2007) introduce hand-to-mouth
consumers and study the effects of government spending under a Taylor rule in a closed
economy. Our setup extends such an analysis to liquidity traps and currency unions in
an open economy.
Our paper is also related to a large empirical literature on fiscal multipliers. Estimating national fiscal multipliers poses serious empirical challenges. The main difficulties
arise from the endogeneity of government spending, the formation of expectations about
future tax and spending policies, and the reaction of monetary policy. Most of the literature tries to resolve these difficulties by resorting to Structural VARs. Some papers use
military spending as an instrument for government spending. The relevant empirical literature is very large, so we refer the reader to Ramey (2011) for a recent survey. Estimating
fiscal multipliers in liquidity traps is nearly impossible because liquidity traps are rare.
The closest substitute is provided by estimates that condition of the level of economic
activity. Some authors (see e.g. Gordon and Krenn, 2010; Auerbach and Gorodnichenko,
2012) estimate substantially larger national multipliers during deep recessions, but the
magnitude of these differential effects remains debated (see e.g. Barro and Redlick, 2009).
States or regions within a country offer an attractive alternative with plausible exogenous variations in spending. Indeed the literature on local multipliers has recently been
very active, with contributions by Clemens and Miran (2010), Cohen et al. (2010), Serrato and Wingender (2010), Shoag (2010), Acconcia et al. (2011), Chodorow-Reich et al.
(2011), Fishback and Kachanovskaya (2010) and Nakamura and Steinsson (2011). These
papers tend to find large multipliers. Our paper helps interpret these findings. Government spending at the local level in these experiments is generally tied to transfers from
outside. It follows that these estimates may be interpreted as combining spending and
transfer multipliers, as we define them here.

A Closed Economy

We adopt a continuous time framework. This is convenient for some calculations but is
completely inessential to any of our results.
We consider a one-time shock to the current and future path of spending that is realized at the beginning of time t = 0 that upsets the steady state. To simplify and focus on
the impulse response to this shock, we abstract from ongoing uncertainty at other dates.1
The remainder of this section spells out the standard New Keynesian model assumptions; readers familiar with this setting may wish to skip directly to Section 3.

We shall only analyze a log-linearized version of the model which collapses these equilibrium conditions into the New Keynesian Phillips curve presented below.

equation and equation (2) is the New Keynesian Philips curve. Here r̄t is the natural
rate of interest, defined as the real interest rate that prevail at the natural allocation, i.e.
equation (1) with ct = 0 for all t ≥ 0 implies it − πt = r̄t for all t ≥ 0.

If prices were completely flexible, then consumption and labor are determined in every period by two static conditions: the labor consumption condition and the resource
constraint. Spending affects the solution and gives rise to the neoclassical multiplier 1 − ξ,
which is positive but less than 1 and entirely due to a wealth effect on labor supply.
From now on we take as given a path for the interest rate {it } summarizing monetary
policy. To resolve or sidestep issues of multiplicity one can assume that there is a date

7

T such that ct = gt = π t = 0 and it = r̄ t for t ≥ T.2 A leading example is a liquidity
trap scenario where it = 0 and r̄t < 0 for t < T. However, although this is a useful
interpretation but is not required for the analysis below.
Remark 1. Suppose c T = 0 for some date T, then
ˆ
ct =

T
t

(it+s − πt+s − r̄t+s )ds

so that given the inflation path {π t } the consumption path {ct } is independent of the
spending path { gt }.
This remark highlights that the mechanism by which government spending affects
consumption, in the New Keynesian model, is inflation which affects the real interest
rate. One can draw two implications from this. First, other policy instruments that affect
inflation, such as taxes, may have similarly policy effects. Second, empirical work on
fiscal multipliers have not focused on the role inflation plays and it may be interesting
to test the predicted connection between output and inflation present in New Keynesian
models.

where {c̃t , π̃t } are equilibria with gt = 0 for all t. We focus on the integral term 0 αis gt+s ds
for i = c, π as a measure of the effects of fiscal policy g 6= 0. We assume the integrals are
well defined, although we allow and discuss the case where it is +∞ or −∞ below.
Focusing on consumption, we call the sequence of coefficients {αcs } fiscal multipliers.
Note that they do not depend on calendar time t, nor do they depend on the interest rate paths {it } and {r t }. Thus, the impact on consumption or output, given by the

that T may be arbitrarily large and will have no impact on the solution provided below. Indeed,
the characterization of the equilibrium is valid even without selecting an equilibrium this way: one just
interprets c∗ and π ∗ below any equilibrium in the set of equilibrium attained when gt = 0 for all t. The
solution then describes the entire set of equilibria for other spending paths { gt }.

´∞
term 0 αcs gt+s ds, depends only on the future path for spending summarized weighted
by {αcs }.
´∞
There are two motivations for adopting 0 αcs gt+s ds as a measure of the impact of
fiscal policy, one more practical the other more conceptual:
1. The more practical motivation applies if the economy finds itself in a liquidity trap
where interest rates immobilized at zero, at least for some time. Fiscal multipliers
{αcs } can then be used to predict the effects of fiscal policy. To see this, suppose the
zero lower bound is binding until T so that it = 0 for t < T; suppose that after
T monetary policy delivers an equilibrium with zero inflation, so that πt = 0 for
t ≥ T. As is well known, the resulting equilibrium without government spending
(gt = 0 for all t) features a negative consumption gap and deflation: c̃t , π̃t < 0 for
t < T (e.g. see Werning, 2012).
Now, consider a stimulus plan that attempts to improve this outcome by setting
´∞
´T
gt > 0 for t < T and gt = 0. Then 0 αcs gt+s ds = 0 αcs gt+s ds is precisely the
effect of the fiscal expansion on consumption ct , relative to the outcome without the
stimulus plan c̃t .
More generally, suppose after the trap we spending may be nonzero and that monetary may or may not be described as securing zero inflation. Even in this case,
we may still use fiscal multipliers to measure the impact of fiscal policy during the
´ T −t
liquidity trap: one can write ct = c T + 0 αcs gt+s ds for t < T, where the c T encapsulates the combined effects of fiscal and monetary policy after the trap t ≥ T.
2. More conceptually, our fiscal multipliers provide a natural decomposition of the
effects of the fiscal policy, over what is attainable by monetary policy alone.
Equations (3a)–(3b) characterize the entire set of equilibria for g 6= 0 by providing
a one-to-one mapping between equilibria with g = 0. Both c̃t and π̃t are equilibria with g = 0 and are affected by monetary policy, as summarized, among other
things, by the interest rate path {it }.
We can represent these facts as a relationship between the set of equilibria with and
without government spending,

E g = E0 + α · g,
where E0 represents the set of equilibria when gt = 0 for all t, while E g is the set of
equilibria for a given path for spending g = { gt }. Here α = {αcs , απ

fiscal multipliers and the cross product α · g represents the integrals 0 αis gt+s ds for
i = c, π. The set E g is a displaced version of E0 in the direction α · g. Each equilibrium point in E0 is shifted in parallel by α · g to another equilibrium point in E g and
it shares the same nominal interest rate path {it }. This last fact is unimportant for
this second conceptual motivation, since the focus is on comparing the two sets, not
equilibrium points. Instead, the important issue is that α · g measures the influence
of government spending on the set of equilibria. This provides a conceptual motivation for studying the multipliers α, since they summarize this influence. In other
words, without spending one can view monetary policy as selecting from the set E0 ,
while with government spending monetary policy can choose from E g . The effects
of fiscal policy on the new options is then precisely determined by the shift α · g.
Figure 1 represents this idea pictorially.3
Our first result delivers a closed-form solution for fiscal multipliers. Using this closed
form one can characterize the multiplier quite tightly.

figure is purposefully abstract and meant to convey the notion of a parallel shift only, so we have
not labeled either axis and the shape of the sets is purely for illustrative purposes.

Proposition 1 (Closed Economy Multiplier). The fiscal multipliers are given by
αcs = σ̂−1 κ (1 − ξ )e−ν̄s

e(ν̄−ν)s − 1
ν̄ − ν

!
.

The instantaneous consumption fiscal multiplier is zero α0c = 0, but is positive, increasing and
convex for large s so that lims→∞ αcs = ∞.
The left panel of figure 2 displays these consumption multipliers αcs as a function of s
for a standard calibration. The proposition states that current spending has no effect on
consumption: α0c = 0. By implication, changes in spending that are very temporary are
expected to have negligible effects on consumption and have an output multiplier that is
near unity. As stated earlier, the effects of government spending on consumption work
through inflation. Current spending does affect the current inflation rate and this affects
the growth rate of consumption. However, since this higher inflation is so short-lived the
lower growth rate for consumption has no significant stretch of time to impact the level
of consumption.
In contrast, spending that takes place in the far future can have a very large impact.
The further out into the future, the larger the impact, since αcs is increasing in s. Indeed,
in the limit the effect becomes unbounded, since lims→∞ αcs = ∞. The logic behind these
11

results is that spending at s > 0 increases inflation over the entire interval of time [0, s].
This then lowers the real interest over this same time interval and lowers the growth rate
of consumption. Since the long-run consumption level is fixed, the lower growth rate
raises the level of consumption. This rise in consumption in turn leads to higher inflation,
creating a feedback cycle. The larger the interval [0, s] over which these effect have time
to act, the larger is the effect on consumption.
The fact that fiscal multipliers are unbounded as s → ∞ stands in strong contrast to
the zero multiplier at s = 0. It also has important implications. For example, a positive path for spending { gt } that is very backloaded can create a very large response for
consumption. This is the case if the shock to spending is very persistent.
Example 1 (AR(1) spending). Suppose gt = ge−ρg t , then if ρ g > −ν > 0 the response of
consumption ct is finite and given by
ˆ

αcs ge−ρg (t+s) ds =

σ̂−1 κ (1 − ξ )
ge−ρg t .
(ρ g + ν)(ρ g + ν̄)

The condition ρ g > −ν > 0 requires spending to revert to zero fast enough to prevent the
integral from being infinite.
´∞
Some paths for spending imply an infinite value for 0 αcs gs ds. For instance, this is the
case in the example above when ρ g < −ν. How should one interpret such cases? Technically, this may invalidate our approximation. However, we think the correct economic
conclusion to draw is that spending will have an explosive positive effect on consumption. One way to see this is to truncate the path of spending { gt }, by setting gt = 0 for all
´T
t ≥ T for some large T. This ensures that 0 αcs gs ds is finite but the response is guaranteed
to be very large if the cutoff is large.
Next, we ask how fiscal multipliers are affected by the degree of price stickiness. Departures from the neoclassical benchmark, where the consumption multiplier is negative,
require some stickiness in prices. Perhaps surprisingly, the resulting Keynesian effects
turn out to be decreasing in the degree of price stickiness.
Proposition 2 (Price Stickiness). The fiscal multipliers {αcs }
1. are zero when prices are rigid κ = 0;
2. are increasing in price flexibility κ;
3. converge to infinity, αcs → ∞, in the limit as prices become fully flexible so that κ → ∞.
12

The logic for these results relies on the fact that spending acts on consumption through
inflation. At one extreme, if prices were perfectly rigid then inflation would be fixed at
zero and spending has no effect on consumption. As prices become more flexible spending has a greater impact on inflation and, hence, on consumption. Indeed, in the limit
as prices become perfectly flexible, inflation becomes so responsive that the effects on
consumption explode.
Recall that our fiscal multipliers are calculated under the assumption that the path for
interest rates remains unchanged when spending rises. These results seem less counterintuitive when one realizes that such a monetary policy, insisting on keeping interest rates
unchanged, may be deemed to be looser when prices are more flexible and inflation reacts
more. Of course, this is precisely the relevant calculation when the economy finds itself
in a liquidity trap, so that interest rates are up against the zero lower bound.

3.2

Summary Fiscal Multipliers

Up to now we have discussed properties of fiscal multipliers {αcs }. Usually, fiscal multipliers are portrayed as a single number that summarizes the impact of some change in
spending on output or consumption, perhaps conditional on the state of the economy or
monetary policy. This requires collapsing the entire sequence of fiscal multipliers {αcs }
into a single number ᾱ, which we shall call a summary fiscal multiplier.
At time t we shock spending from zero to { gt+s } and wish to summarize the impact
on current consumption ct by the ratio
´∞

ᾱ = ´ 0∞
0

αcs gs ds
g

αs gs ds

.

The numerator is simply the impact on consumption, while the denominator introduces
g
a weighting sequence {αs } to summarize the path of spending into a single number.
One natural candidate is to have the denominator represent a present value by setting
´s
´s
g
g
g
αs = e− 0 rz dz , αS = e− 0 (it −πt )dz or αs = e−ρs . It is common in the literature to compute
multipliers using current spending only as follows:
´∞
ᾱ =

0

αcs gs ds

g0

One can interpret this as an extreme (Dirac) weighting function α g that puts full mass at
s = 0 and no weight on any s > 0.

We could also take an average for the impact on consumption 0 αcs gt+s ds at each
13

where {λct } are weights. The summary multipliers above implicitly put full weight on
the consumption response at t = 0, but we can also consider nonzero weights on future
consumption responses. For example, we could set {λct } so as to compute the response in
the present value of consumption.
As this discussion makes clear there are many possibilities for summary multipliers
and no universal criteria to select them. Instead, one can adapt the summary multiplier
to the application and relevant policy at hand. The characterizations provided in the
previous section have implications for any of these measures. Namely,
1. the instantaneous multiplier is zero: if spending { gt } converges to being concentrated at t = 0 then ᾱ = 0;
2. the multiplier is increasing in flexibility, it is zero with rigid prices κ = 0 and goes
to infinity in the limit of flexible prices κ → ∞, provided gt is positive for all t.
Example 2. Suppose we have an autoregressive spending path gt = ge−ρg t for ρ g > 0.
The summary multiplier is independent of g0 and given by

Both the numerator and denominator are weighted averages of {αcs } and {αs }. Higher
values of ρ g then shift weight towards the future. Recall that αc is increasing. If α g is decreasing, as is most natural, then the numerator increases and the denominator decreases
with ρ g . More persistence leads to higher summary multipliers.
The next result is related to this example and shows that delays in spending increase the
summary multiplier.

Endogenous Spending and Filling the Gap

The policies for the spending under consideration may be best thought of as endogenous,
because they depend on the state of the economy which itself depends on parameters. As
we vary parameters this affects both structural fiscal multipliers {αct } and the path { gt }.
Both impact summary fiscal multipliers.
Example 3. Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) compute summary multipliers in
a liquidity trap as a function of parameters, using initial spending in the denominator.
Their results suggest that parameter values that make the recession worse also lead to
larger multipliers. In some cases this follow because the parameters affect the fiscal multipliers {αcs } directly. For example, this is true for the degree of price flexibility κ. Higher
price flexibility makes the recession worse (Werning, 2012) and also leads to higher fiscal
multipliers as shown in Proposition 2. However, in other cases their conclusion rely on
the indirect effects that these parameters have on the policy experiment { gt } and, thus,
on summary multipliers.
Their setup features Poisson uncertainty, but a deterministic version of their calculations is as follows.4 Suppose the economy is in a liquidity trap with zero interest rates for
t ≤ T and will returns to the natural allocation ct = gt = 0 for t ≥ T. Consider fiscal
policy interventions that increase spending during the trap, gt = g for t ≤ T and gt = 0
for t > T. Higher T leads to a deeper recession (see Werning, 2012), but has no effect
on the fiscal multipliers {αct }. However, T does have an indirect effect on the summary
multiplier
´T c
ˆ T
0 αs ḡds

which is increasing and convex in T.
If T is larger the summary multiplier is larger, but not because spending is any more
effective. For instance, it would be wrong conclude that a stimulus plan that increased
spending for a fixed amount of time, such as a year or two, would be more powerful when
T is large. Rather, when T is increased then spending during the trap has a bigger effect
because we are doing more of it by extending the time interval over which it takes place.
Indeed, since this extension backloads spending we know from Proposition 1 that it will
be particularly effective. Of course, this extension may be warranted precisely because
spending affects the allocation at all prior dates.
Example 4. Another perspective is provided when gt is set as a function of current con4 Their

parameter p, which represents the probability of remaining in the trap, has an effect similar to T
in our deterministic setting.

sumption:
gt = −Ψct ,
then the Phillips curve becomes
π̇ t = ρπ t − κ (1 − (1 − ξ )Ψ)ct ,
and the equilibrium is just as if we had a lower κ given by κ̂ = κ (1 − (1 − ξ )Ψ).
Suppose further that Ψ = (1 − ξ )−1 , so that spending fills the gap and ct + (1 − ξ ) gt =
0. Inflation is then zero and the outcome for consumption is as if prices were completely
rigid κ̂ = 0. With this particular policy in place, consider different values for κ. The
spending path gt does not depend on κ. However, the equilibrium outcome without
spending (i.e. gt = 0) is decreasing in κ (see Werning, 2012). Thus, fiscal policy affects
consumption more the more flexible prices are. This result is consistent with our more
general results in Proposition 2 regarding the effects of price flexibility.

An Open Economy Model of a Currency Union

We now turn to open economy models similar to Farhi and Werning (2012a,b) which in
turn build on Gali and Monacelli (2005, 2008).
The model focuses on a continuum of regions or countries that share a common currency. One interpretation is that these regions are states or provinces within a country.
Our analysis is then directly relevant to the literature estimating “local” multipliers, exploiting cross-sectional variation in spending behavior across states in the United States
to estimate the effects on income and employment. Another interpretation is to member
countries within a currency union, such as the European Monetary Union (EMU). Our
analysis then sheds light on the debates over fiscal policy, stimulus versus austerity, for
periphery countries.
For concreteness, from now on we will refer to these economic units (regions or countries) simply as countries. We focus on the effects around a symmetric steady state after a
fiscal policy is realized in every country. A crucial ingredient is how private agents share
risk internationally. We consider the two polar case: (i) incomplete markets, where agents
can only trade a risk-free bond; and (ii) complete markets with perfect risk sharing. These
two market structures have different implications for fiscal multipliers.

16

4.1

Households

There is a continuum measure one of countries i ∈ [0, 1]. We focus attention on a single
country, which we call “home” and can be thought of as a particular value H ∈ [0, 1]. We
will focus on a one time shock, so that all uncertainty is realized at t = 0. Thus, we can
describe the economy after the realization of the shock as a deterministic function of time.
In every country, there is a representative household with preferences represented by
the utility function

Thus, e is the elasticity between varieties produced within a given country, η the elasticity
between domestic and foreign goods, and γ the elasticity between goods produced in
different foreign countries. An important special case obtains when σ = η = γ = 1. We
call this the Cole-Obstfeld case, in reference to Cole and Obstfeld (1991).
The parameter α indexes the degree of home bias, and can be interpreted as a measure
of openness. Consider both extremes: as α → 0 the share of foreign goods vanishes; as
α → 1 the share of home goods vanishes. Since the country is infinitesimal, the latter
17

captures a very open economy without home bias; the former a closed economy barely
trading with the outside world.

and Tt is a nominal lump-sum transfer. All these variables are expressed in the common
currency. The bond holdings of home agents is denoted by Dt and the common nominal
interest rate within the union is denoted by it .
We sometimes allow for transfers across countries that are contingent on shocks. These
transfers may be due to private arrangements in complete financial markets. or due to
government arrangements. These transfers can accrue to the government or directly to
the agents. This is irrelevant since lump-sum taxes are available. For example, we sometimes consider the assumption of complete markets where agents in different countries
can perfectly share risks in a complete set of financial markets. Agents form international
portfolios, the returns of which result in international transfers that are contingent on the
realization of the shock. A different example is in Section 6 where we consider government spending in the home country paid for by a transfer from the rest of the world. In
this case, we have in mind a direct transfer to the government of the home country, or
simply spending paid for and made by the rest of the world.

introduce hand-to-mouth consumers into the model.

monopoly distortion so that τ L = − 1ε , as is standard in the literature. However, none of
our results hinge on this particular value.
Price-setting assumptions. We assume that the Law of One Price holds so that at all
times, the price of a given variety in different countries is identical once expressed in the
same currency.

where NFAt is the country’s net foreign assets at t, which for convenience, we measure in

home numeraire. We impose a standard no-Ponzi condition, e− 0 is ds NFAt → 0 as t → ∞.
Absent transfers or insurance across countries we set NFA0 to be constant for all shock
realizations, and normalize its value to zero. Instead, when markets are complete we
require that Θ does not vary with the shock realization. We then solve for the initial value
of NFA0 that is needed, for each shock realization. This value can be interpreted as an
insurance transfer from the rest of the world.

Finally with Calvo price setting we have the equations summarizing the first-order
condition for optimal price setting. We omit these conditions since we will only analyze
a log-linearized version of the model.

5

National and Local Fiscal Multipliers in Currency Unions

To compute local multipliers we study the log-linearized equilibrium conditions around a
symmetric steady state with zero inflation. We denote the deviations of output and public
consumption on home goods relative to steady state output by
ct = (1 − G)(log(Yt − Gt ) − log(Y − G )) ≈
yt = log(Yt ) − log(Y ) ≈

Yt − Y
Y

Yt − Gt − (Y − G )
Y

gt = G(log Gt − log G ) ≈

Gt − G
Y

where G = G
Y denotes the steady state share of government spending in output. Then we
have, up to a first order approximation,
y t = c t + gt ,
Note that ct does not represent private domestic total consumption (of home and foreign
goods); instead it is private consumption (domestic and foreign) of domestic goods. In a
closed economy the two coincide, but in an open economy, for our purposes, the latter is
more relevant and convenient.
The log linearized system can then be written as a set of differential equations
π̇ H,t = ρπ H,t − κ (ct + (1 − ξ ) gt ) − λσ̂α(ω − 1)c∗t − (1 − G)λσ̂αωθ,
ċt = σ̂−1 (it∗ − π H,t − ρ) − α(ω − 1)ċ∗t ,

Equation (4) is the New-Keynesian Philips Curve. Equation (5) is the Euler equation.
Equation (6) is derived from the requirement that the terms of trade are predetermined
at t = 0 because prices are sticky and the exchange rate is fixed. Finally equation (7)
together with either (8) or (9) depending on whether markets are incomplete or complete,
represents the country budget constraint. In the Cole-Obstfeld case σ = η = γ = 1,
we have Ω = 0 so that the complete and incomplete markets solutions coincide. Away
from the Cole-Obstfeld case, the complete and incomplete markets solutions differ. The
incomplete markets solution imposes that the country budget constraint (7) with nfa0 = 0,
while the complete markets solution solves for the endogenous value of nfa0 that ensures
that the country budget constraint (7) holds with θ = 0. This can be interpreted as an
insurance payment from the rest of the world.

Home Government Spending

We first consider the experiment where the only shock is home government spending, so
that it∗ = ρ, gt∗ = y∗t = c∗t = 0. Note that if gt = 0 throughout then θ = 0 and yt = ct = 0.
We shall compute the deviations from this steady state when gt 6= 0.
22

The assumptions one makes about financial markets can affect the results. We consider, in turn, both the cases of complete markets and incomplete markets.
Complete Markets. We start by studying the case where markets are complete. This
assumption is representative of most of the literature. The assumption is often adopted
as a benchmark due to its tractability. The key implication is that consumption is insured
against spending shocks. In equilibrium, private agents make arrangements with the
rest of the world to receive transfers when spending shoots up and, conversely, to make
transfers when spending shoots down. As a result, government sending shocks to not
affect consumption on impact. Formally, we have θ = 0, so the system becomes
π̇ H,t = ρπ H,t − κ (ct + (1 − ξ ) gt ),
ċt = −σ̂−1 π H,t ,

with initial condition
c0 = 0.

where the superscript CM stands for complete markets. Note two important differences
with the closed economy case. First, there are both forward- and backward-looking effects
from government spending; the lower bound in these integrals is now given by −t instead
of 0. At every point in time consumption is pinned down by the terms of trade which
depend on past inflation. Second, the multipliers depend on calendar time t.

The right panel of figure 2 displays consumption multipliers for a standard calibration.
Consumption multipliers are very different in an open economy with a fixed exchange
rate. For starters, part (1) says that the initial response of consumption is always zero,
simply restating the initial condition above that c0 = 0. This follows from the fact that the
terms of trade are predetermined and complete markets insure consumption.
Part (2) proves that the consumption response at any other date is actually negative.
Note that the Euler equation and the initial condition together imply that
ct = −σ̂−1 log

PH,t
.
PH

Government spending increases demand, leading to inflation, a rise in PH,t . In other
words, it leads to an appreciation in the terms of trade and this loss in competitiveness
depresses private demand, from both domestic and foreign consumers. Although we
have derived this result in a specific setting, we expect it to be robust. The key ingredients
are that consumption depends negatively on the terms of trade and that government
spending creates inflation.
It may seem surprising that the output multiplier is necessarily less than one whenever the exchange rate is fixed, because this contrasts sharply with our conclusions in a
closed economy with a fixed interest rate. They key here is that a fixed exchange rate
implies a fixed interest rate, but the reverse is not true. We expand on this idea in the next
subsection.
Part (3) says that the impact of government spending at any date on private consumption vanishes in the long run. This exact long run neutrality relies on the assumption of
complete markets; otherwise, there are potential long-run neoclassical wealth effects from
accumulation of foreign assets.
Part (4) says that spending near zero and spending in the very far future have negligible impacts on consumption at any date. Spending near zero affects inflation for a
trivial amount of time and thus have has insignificant effects on the level of home prices.
Similarly, spending in the far future has vanishing effects on inflation at any date.
Example 5 (Complete Markets, AR(1)). Suppose that gt = ge−ρg t and that markets are

complete. Then
ct = − geνt

1 − e−(ν+ρg )t σ̂−1 κ (1 − ξ )
.
ν̄ + ρ g
ν + ρg

For g > 0, this example shows that ct is always negative. In other words, in the open
economy model with complete markets, output always expands less than the increase in
government spending. The intuition is simple. Because the terms of trade are predetermined, private spending on home goods is also predetermined so that c0 = 0. Government spending initially leads to inflation because the total (public and private) demand
for home goods is increased in the short run. With fixed nominal interest rates, inflation
depresses real interest rates, leading to a decreasing path of private consumption of domestic goods, so that ct becomes negative. The inflationary pressures are greatest at t = 0
and they then recede over time as public and private demand decrease. Indeed at some
point in time, inflation becomes negative and in the long run, the terms of trade return to
their steady state value. At that point, private consumption of domestic goods cˆt reaches
its minimum and starts increasing, returning to 0 in the long run. The crucial role of inflation in generating ct < 0 is most powerfully illustrated in the rigid price case. When
prices are entirely rigid, we have κ = 0 so that ct = 0 throughout.5
An interesting observation is that the openness parameter α enters Proposition 4 or
Example 5 only through its effect on σ̂.6 As a result, in the Cole-Obstfeld case σ = η = γ =
1 and the private consumption multipliers αc,t
s are completely independent of openness α.
c,t
Away from the Cole-Obstfeld case, αs depends on α, but its dependence can be positive
or negative depending on the parameters.7
Next, we ask how fiscal multipliers are affected by the degree of price stickiness.
Proposition 5 (Price Stickiness). The fiscal multipliers {αc,t,CM
} depend on price flexibility as
s
follows:
1. when prices are rigid so that κ = 0, we have αc,t,CM
= 0 for all s and t;
s
2. when prices become perfectly flexible κ → ∞, then for all t, the function s → αsc,t,CM
converges in distributions to −(1 − ξ ) times a Dirac distribution concentrated at s = 0,
´∞
implying that −t αc,t,CM
gt+s ds = −(1 − ξ ) gt for all (continuous and bounded) paths of

Unlike in the liquidity trap, fiscal multipliers do not explode when prices become more
flexible. In a liquidity trap, government spending sets into motion a feedback loop between consumption and inflation: government spending increases inflation, which lower
real interest rates, increases private consumption, further increasing inflation etc. ad infinitum. This feedback loop is non-existent in a currency union: government spending
increases inflation, appreciates the terms of trade, reduces private consumption, reducing
the inflationary pressure. Instead, the allocation converges to the flexible price allocation ct = −(1 − ξ ) gt when prices become very flexible. At the flexible price allocation,
private consumption is entirely determined by contemporaneous government spending.
Hence the function αc,t,CM
of s converges in distributions to −(1 − ξ ) times a Dirac funcs
tion at s = 0. This implies that fact that for s = 0, limκ →∞ αc,t,CM
= −∞ and for s 6= 0,
s
c,t,CM
limκ →∞ αs
= 0.
One can reinterpret the neoclassical outcome with flexible prices as applying to the
case with rigid prices and a flexible exchange rate that is adjusted to replicate the flexible
price allocation. The output multiplier is then less than one. The first result says that
with rigid prices but fixed exchange rates, output multipliers are equal to one. In this
sense, the comparison between fixed with flexible exchange rates confirms the conventional view from the Mundell-Flemming model that fiscal policy is more effective with
fixed exchange rates (see e.g. Dornbusch, 1980). This is consistent with the simulation
findings in Corsetti, Kuester and Muller (2011).
Incomplete Markets.
We now turn our attention to the case where markets are incomplete. Although the complete market assumption is often adopted for tractability,
we believe incomplete markets may be a better approximation to reality in most cases of
interest.
A shock to spending may create income effects that affect consumption and labor responses. The complete markets solution secures transfers from the rest of the world that
effectively cancel these income effects. As a result, the incomplete markets solution is in
general different from the complete market case. One exception is the Cole-Obstfeld case,
where σ = η = γ = 1.
With incomplete markets, the system becomes

necessarily changes signs (both as a function of s for a given t, and as a function of t, for
a given s). In this sense, incomplete markets cannot robustly overturn the conclusion of

This means that with complete markets, home receives an endogenous transfer nfa0 from

between these two solutions can then be obtained as the effect of this endogenous transfer,
using the analysis in Section 6.2.

The second term of the right hand side of the expression for ct is identical to the complete

term on the right hand side of this expression arises only because markets are incomplete.
Indeed in vanishes in the Cole-Obstfeld case where the complete and incomplete markets
solution coincide. It is small compared to the first term in the neighborhood of the ColeObstfeld case. It necessarily changes sign over time. For ωσ close to 1, θ is of the same sign
as 1 − ωσ . Hence the first term is of the same sign as 1 − ωσ for small t and of the opposite
sign for large t.

Understanding Closed versus Open Economy Multipliers

Figure 2 provides a sharp illustration of the difference between a liquidity trap and a
currency union. In a liquidity trap, consumption multipliers are positive, increase with
the date of spending, and becomes arbitrarily large for long-dated spending. By contrast,
in a currency union, consumption multipliers are negative, V-shaped and bounded as a
function of the date of spending, and asymptote to zero for long-dated spending.
Before continuing it is useful to pause to develop a deeper understanding of the key
difference between the closed and open economy results. The two models are somewhat
different—the open economy features trade in goods and the closed economy does not—
yet they are quite comparable. Indeed, we will highlight that the crucial difference lies
28

in monetary policy, not model primitives. Although a fixed exchange rate implies a fixed
nominal interest rate, the converse is not true.
To make the closed economy and open economies more comparable we consider the
limit of the latter as α → 0. This limit represents a closed economy in the sense that preferences display an extreme home bias and trade is zero. To simplify, we focus on the case
of complete markets so that θ = 0. Even in this limit case, the closed and open economy
multipliers differ. This might seems surprising since, after all, both experiments consider
the effects of government spending for a fixed nominal interest rate. To understand the
difference, we allow for an initial devaluation.
Consider then the open economy model in the closed-economy limit α → 0 and let
e0 denote the new value for the exchange rate after the shock in log deviations relative
to its steady-state value (so that e0 = 0 represents no devaluation). The only difference
introduced in the system by such one-time devaluation is a change the initial condition
to8
c0 = σ̂−1 e0 .
The exchange rate devaluation e0 depreciates the initial terms of trade one for one and
increases the demand for home goods through an expenditure switching effect. Of course,
this stimulative effect is present in the short run, but vanishes in the long run once prices
have adjusted.
Now if in the closed economy limit of the open economy model, we set the devaluation
´∞
e0 so that σ̂−1 e0 exactly equals the initial consumption response 0 αcs gt+s ds of the closed
economy model, i.e.

then we find exactly the same response for consumption and inflation as in the closed

29

an initial devaluation given by (10), then the multipliers of the closed economy limit of
the open economy model would coincide with those of the closed economy model.9
This analysis shows that the policy analysis conducted for our closed economy model
implicitly combines a shock to government spending with a devaluation.10 In contrast,
our open economy analysis assumes fixed exchange rates, ruling out such devaluations.
The positive response of consumption in the closed economy model relies entirely on this
one-time devaluation. Thus, the key difference between the two models is in monetary
policy, not whether the economy is modeled as open or closed. Indeed, we have taken the
closed-economy limit α → 0, but the results hold more generally: the degree of openness
α matters only indirectly through its impact on σ̂, ν and ν̄ and in the Cole-Obstfeld case,
α actually does not even affect these parameters.

5.3

Domestic Government Spending on Foreign Goods

We now analyze the impact of domestic government spending on foreign goods g F,t . We
treat both the cases of complete and incomplete markets.
When markets are complete, spending on foreign goods has absolutely no effect, ct =
0 and π H,t = 0. This follows because this shock to spending is then effectively fully
paid for by foreigners and it does not affect the demand for home goods. Of course, if
we consider intermediate cases, where the home government spends on both home and
foreign goods, the conclusion is that only the spending on home goods has any effect. Part
of government spending leaks abroad, increasing the demand for foreign goods. Only the
increase in home goods provides stimulus to the home economy.
When markets are incomplete these negative conclusions are reinforced. The effect of
a spending shock in the home country that is spent entirely on foreign goods is identical
to the response in a complete market setting together with a negative transfer equal to the
present value of the spending shock,
ˆ
nfa0 = −

∞

0

e−ρt g F,t dt.

9 Note that the size of this devaluation is endogenous and grows without bound as prices become more
flexible i.e. as κ increases. This explains why large multipliers are possible with high values of κ in the
closed economy model: they are associated with large devaluations.
10 To see what this implies, suppose the spending shock has a finite life so that g = 0 for t ≥ T for some
t
T and that monetary policy targets inflation for t ≥ T. In the closed economy model inflation is always
positive and the price level does not return to its previous level. In contrast, in the open economy model
with a fixed exchange rate (no devaluation) inflation is initially positive but eventually negative and the
price level returns to its initial steady state value. Indeed, if gt > 0 for t < T and gt = 0 for t ≥ T for
some T, then inflation is strictly negative for t ≥ T and the price level falls towards its long run value
asymptotically.

30

In the short run, it reduces the domestic demand for home goods, depressing output.
In the long run, output is increased by the standard neoclassical wealth effects on labor
supply. We refer the reader to Section 6.2 below where we provide a detailed analysis of
the effects of such transfers.

5.4

Foreign Government Spending

We now consider the effects of a shock to spending by a foreign country. In particular,
suppose the rest of the world changes its government spending adopting the path { gt∗ }
but that spending remains unchanged in the home country so that gt = 0 for all t ≥ 0.
We must take a stand on monetary policy within the union. We assume that monetary
policy adjusts so as to implement the flexible price allocation for the union as a whole.
This amounts to
c∗t = −(1 − ξ ) gt∗

πt∗ = 0

it∗ − ρ = −σ̂(1 − ξ ) ġt∗ ,

so that at the union level we obtain the neoclassical effect from spending and no inflation.
The interest rate is adjusted depending on the growth rate of spending; if the shock is
transitory, so that g0∗ > 0 and ġt∗ < 0, the interest rate it∗ rises.
To see how this affects the home country we assume, for simplicity, the case of complete markets so that θ = 0. The system is then
π̇ H,t = ρπ H,t − κct + λσ̂α(ω − 1)(1 − ξ ) gt∗ ,

ċt = −σ̂−1 π H,t − (1 − α(ω − 1))(1 − ξ ) ġt∗ ,

with the initial condition
c0 = −(1 − ξ ) g0∗ .
Proposition 7 (Foreign Government Spending). Suppose that markets are complete, then

There are now both direct effects and indirect effects. The indirect effects work through

inflation, which affect the terms of trade and, hence, demand for home goods. To simplify
the expressions consider the Cole-Obstfeld case where ω = 1. To isolate the direct effects
∗
set κ = 0, so that there is no inflation and αc,t,CM
= 0. The demand for home goods is then
s
equal to ct = −(1 − ξ ) gt∗ . When foreign spending rises it depresses private spending by
foreigners, lowering the demand for home output. When κ > 0, the indirect effect works
through inflation and is positive in the Cole-Obstfeld case. The lower demand for home
goods creates deflation at home, which makes the economy more competitive. The lower
prices then increase the demand for home goods.11
Example 7 (Foreign Government Spending, AR(1)). Suppose that gt∗ = g∗ e−ρg t and that
markets are complete, then we have
"
ct = −eνt (1 − ξ ) g∗

In the Cole-Obstfeld case, so that ω = 1, this implies that c0 is negative if g∗ is positive. If
ρ g + ν < 0 then ct will remain negative. If instead ρ g + ν > 0 then ct starts out negative,
but eventually switches signs.
This results suggests that a temporary increase in government spending abroad accompanied by monetary tightening to ensure no inflation abroad induces a recession at
home. This fits a common narrative regarding the post German reunification in the early
90s. The fiscal expansion was combined with a monetary contraction in Germany, so as
to avoid inflation. The quasi-fixed exchange rate arrangements of the EMS forced other
countries to follow suit and tighten monetary policy, negatively affecting their economic
performance.

Spending Paid by Foreigners and Transfer Multipliers

6.1

Home Government Spending Paid by Foreign

In this section, we examine what happens when the home country “doesn’t pay” for the
increase in government spending at home. We show that this modification can make an
important difference and produce larger multipliers. This consideration is likely to be
important in practice: indeed, a large part of the “local multiplier” literature considers

is the transfer from foreign to home that pays for the increase in government spending.
We provide a closed form solution in the appendix, but the expressions for this closed
form solution are quite involved. Here we focus on two cases that are more tractable and
amenable to clean intuitions: the Cole-Obstfeld case and the case of entirely rigid prices.
In in the Cole-Obstfeld case σ = η = γ = 1, we have Γ = 1 and Ω = 0 .We denote the
consumption multipliers with a superscript PF, which stands for paid for.

When government spending is paid for by foreign, the associated transfer from foreign
to home increases the demand for home goods as long as there is home bias. It also
creates a wealth effect which tends to reduces the output of home goods. In the short
run, output is demand-determined leading to a Keynesian expansion effect on private
consumption. The neoclassical effect only kicks in in the long run when the terms of
trade have appreciated significantly. The Keynesian effect dominates dominates in the
short run and the neoclassical wealth effect dominates in the long run.

Note that the second term on the right hand side of the expression for ct in Proposition
8 is simply the term identified in Proposition 4 in the complete markets case. The first term
is different from the corresponding term in Proposition 6 in the incomplete markets case,
which is simply 0 in the Cole-Obstfeld case. The discrepancy arises precisely because
government spending is now paid for by foreign. This takes the form of a transfer from
foreign to home.
It is particularly useful to look at the predictions of this proposition for t = 0 and
t → ∞. In the case of a stimulus g > 0, we have c0 > 0 > limt→∞ ct . Following a positive
stimulus shock, we can get c0 > 0 and actually ct > 0 for some time (because θ > 0) and
eventually cˆt < 0. The conclusion would be that an unpaid for fiscal stimulus at home has
a larger consumption multiplier in the short run and smaller in the long run. This is true
as long as there is home bias α < 1. The reason is that the associated transfer redistributes
wealth from foreign to home consumers. This increases the demand for home goods
because of home bias. In the neoclassical model with flexible prices, there would be an
appreciation of the terms of trade and a reduction in the output of home goods because
of a neoclassical wealth effect. With sticky prices, prices cannot adjust in the short term,
and so this appreciation cannot take place right away, and so the output of home goods
increases. In the long run, prices adjust and we get the neoclassical effect.
We now turn to the case of entirely rigid prices.
Proposition 9 (Spending Paid by Foreign, Rigid Prices). Suppose that government spending
is paid for by foreigners and that prices are entirely rigid, then

With rigid prices, when government spending is not paid by foreign, we have ct = 0.
Instead when government spending is paid by foreign, we have ct > 0 when g > 0. The
ρ
annuity value of the transfer received from foreign is simple g ρ+ρg . The multiplier effect
of this transfer on output is given by

1− α
1
1
α 1−Ω(1−G)(1−α) Γ .

In the Cole-Obstfeld case, this

multiplier takes the simple form 1−α α , the relative expenditure share of home goods. Note
that this effect is permanent despite the fact that the government spending shock is meanreverting. This is because the effect of the transfer is permanent. We provide a detailed
intuition for this result in Section 6.2 below.
The lesson of this section is that we can partly overturn the conclusion of Proposition
4 when government spending is paid for by foreign. The reason is that the associated
transfer from foreign stimulates private consumption and output.

6.2

Transfer Multipliers

The previous section highlights the role of transfers. We do it in the Cole-Obstfeld case
where σ = η = γ = 1 for simplicity. The next proposition characterizes the response of
the economy to a marginal increase in transfers nfa0 . Because the model is linear, we can
represent this dependence by some coefficients βc,t such that
cˆt = βc,t nfa0 ,
π H,t = βπ,t nfa0 .
Proposition 10 (Transfer Multipliers, Cole-Obstfeld). In the Cole-Obstfeld case σ = η =
γ = 1, transfer multipliers are given by

in all these expressions is natural because what matters is the annuity value ρnfa0 of the
βπ,t

35

−νeνt

transfer.
Transfers have opposite effects on output in the short and long run. In the short run,
when prices are rigid, there is a Keynesian effect due to the fact that transfers stimulate the
demand for home goods: βc,0 = ρ 1−α α . In the long run, when prices adjust, the neoclassical
wealth effect on labor supply lowers output: limt→∞ βc,t = −ρ 1 1 . In the medium run,
1−G + φ

the speed of adjustment, from the Keynesian short-run response to the neoclassical longrun response, is controlled by the degree of price flexibility κ, which affects ν.12
Note that the determinants of the Keynesian and neoclassical wealth effects are very
different. The strength of the Keynesian effect hinges on the relative expenditure share
of home goods 1−α α : the more closed the economy, the larger the Keynesian effect. The
strength of the neoclassical wealth effect depends on the elasticity of labor supply φ: the
more elastic labor supply, the larger the neoclassical wealth effect.
Positive transfers also increase home inflation. The long-run cumulated response in
the price of home produced goods equals ρ 1−α α + ρ 1 1 . The first term ρ 1−α α comes from
1−G + φ

the fact that transfers increase the demand for home goods, due to home bias. The second
term ρ 1 1 is due to a neoclassical wealth effect that reduces labor supply, raising the
1−G + φ

wage. How fast this increase in the price of home goods occurs depends positively on the
flexibility of prices through its effect on ν.13
These effects echo the celebrated Transfer Problem controversy of Keynes (1929) and
Ohlin (1929). With home bias, a transfer generates a boom when prices are sticky, and a
real appreciation of the terms of trade when prices are flexible. The neoclassical wealth
effect associated with a transfer comes into play when prices are flexible, and generates
an output contraction and a further real appreciation.
The analysis generalizes away from the Cole-Obstfeld case, but the corresponding
formulas become more involved. However, a simple formula arises in the case where
prices are rigid, in which cases transfer multipliers are constant.
Proposition 11 (Transfer Multipliers, Rigid Prices). When prices are entirely rigid, the transfer multipliers are given by
βc,t =

1
11−α
ρ.
1 − Ω(1 − G)(1 − α) Γ α

We can also treat the closed economy limit (α = 0) and the fully open economy limit
(α = 1).
12 Note

that ν is decreasing in κ, with ν = 0 when prices are rigid (κ = 0), and ν = −∞ when prices are
flexible (κ = ∞).
13 Recall that ν is decreasing in the degree of price flexibility κ.

36

Proposition 12 (Transfer Multipliers). In the closed economy limit we have limα→0 βc,t = ∞.
In the fully open economy limit we have limα→0 βc,t = 0.
The intuition for this proposition is that the Keynesian effect of transfers is commensurate with the relative expenditure share on home goods 1−α α . This proposition underscores that transfers are much more stimulative than government spending, the more so,
the more closed the economy. This robust negative dependence of transfer multipliers
βc,t on openness α should be contrasted with the lack of clear dependence on openness of
government spending multipliers αc,t,CM
noted above (indeed in the Cole Obstfeld case,
s
c,t,CM

Liquidity Constraints and Non-Ricardian Effects

In this section, we explore non-Ricardian effects of fiscal policy in a closed and open
economy setting. To do so, we follow Campbell and Mankiw (1989), Mankiw (2000) and
Gali et al. (2007) and introduce hand-to-mouth consumers, a tractable way of modeling
liquidity constraints. The latter paper studied the effects of government spending under a
Taylor rule in a closed economy. Instead, our focus here is on liquidity traps and currency
unions.

7.1

Hand to Mouth in the Closed Economy

The model is modified as follows. A fraction 1 − χ of agents are optimizers, and a fraction
χ are hand-to-mouth. Optimizers are exactly as before. Hand-to-mouth agents cannot
save or borrow, and instead simply consume their labor income in every period, net of
lump-sum taxes trt . These lump-sum taxes are allowed to differ between optimizers (tot )
and hand-to-mouth agents (trt ).
We log-linearize around a steady state where optimizers and hand-to-mouth consumers have the same consumption and supply the same labor. In the appendix, we
show that the model can be summarized by the following two equations
ċt = σ̃−1 (it − r̄t − πt ) + Θ̃n ġt − Θ̃τ ṫrt ,

π̇t = ρπt − κ [ct + (1 − ξ ) gt ],

where σ̃, Θ̃n and Θ̃τ are positive constants defined in the appendix. The presence of
hand-to-mouth consumers introduces two new terms in the Euler equation, one involving
government spending and the other one involving taxes—both direct determinants of the
37

consumption of hand-to-mouth agents. These terms drop out without hand-to-mouth
consumers, since χ = 0 implies Θ̃n = Θ̃τ = 0 and σ̃ = σ̂.
As before we define

With hand-to-mouth consumers, we have additional terms in the closed form solution.
We start with the tax terms. Lower taxes on hand-to-mouth consumers today increases
consumption. This is intuitive since this redistributes income either from future hand-tomouth consumers or optimizing agents towards current hand-to-mouth consumers, i.e.
from consumers with a low propensity to consume today out of current income to consumers with a high propensity to consume today out of current income. Lower taxes on
hand-to-mouth consumers in the future stimulates their consumption tomorrow, which
increases inflation today and in the future, reducing the real interest rate and increasing
consumption of optimizing agents today.
We continue with the government spending terms. Higher government spending today increases consumption. This is because government spending increases the income
of current hand to mouth consumers, and hence their consumption. Higher government
spending in the future increases consumption more than in the model with only optimizing agents. The reason is that government spending in the future partly falls on handto-mouth consumers, stimulating their consumption tomorrow, which increases inflation
today and in the future, reducing the real interest rate and increasing consumption of
optimizing agents today.

38

Hence both for taxes and government spending, hand-to-mouth consumers introduces additional traditional Keynesian effects (through the income of current hand-tomouth consumers), and additional New-Keynesian effects (through the income of future
hand-to-mouth consumers feeding back into inflation). The New Keynesian effects become more potent when prices are more flexible (when κ increases), which is intuitive
since these effects work through inflation. This is not the case for the Keynesian effects.
It is important to understand how these results depend on fixed interest rates, due,
say, to a binding zero lower bound. Away from this bound, monetary policy could be
chosen to replicate the flexible price allocation with zero inflation. The required nominal
interest rate is impacted by the presence of hand-to-mouth consumers


it = σ̃ (1 − ξ ) + Θ̃n ġt + σ̃Θ̃τ ṫrt ,
but consumption is not
ct = −(1 − ξ ) gt .
Hence away from the zero bound, we get the neoclassical multiplier, which is determined completely statically and does not depend on the presence of hand-to-mouth consumers.14 In contrast, whenever monetary policy does not or cannot replicate the flexible
price allocation, then hand-to-mouth consumers do make a difference for fiscal multipliers. Gali et al. (2007) consider a Taylor rule which falls short of replicating the flexible
price allocation. Here we have focused on fixed interest rates, motivated by liquidity
traps.
Panel (a) in Figure 3 displays the response of consumption over time for an AR(1)
government spending shock. The shock mean reverts quite quickly here. The response
of consumption is non-monotonic in the fraction of hand-to-mouth agents. Higher χ implies there are more hand to mouth consumers and fewer savers. At the same time, future
spending hand-to-mouth agents also contributes to inflation, and hence to current spending by optimizing agents. Which of these effects dominates is ambiguous. Overall, for
our simulations, more hand-to-mouth agents means higher multipliers at impact, but the
effect reverses at some point in time. This figure makes clear that the interplay between
the increase in future spending by hand-to-mouth agents, the inflation that it generates,
and the current and future spending decisions of optimizing agents is extremely potent
and can generate very large multipliers.
14 Note

however that hand-to-mouth agents might change the associated allocation of optimizers. They
just don’t matter for the aggregate allocation.

Hand to Mouth in the Open Economy

We now turn to the open economy version with hand to mouth agents. In the appendix,
we show that the system becomes
π̇ H,t = ρπ H,t − κ̃ (ct + (1 − ξ ) gt ) − (1 − G)λσ̃ α̃ω̃θ,
ċt = −σ̃−1 π H,t + Θ̃n ġt − Θ̃τ ṫrt ,

Just as in the closed economy case, hand-to-mouth consumers introduce additional
Keynesian effects (through the spending of current hand-to-mouth agents) and New Keynesian effects through cumulated inflation (via past and future hand-to-mouth agents).
Just as in the closed economy case, the Keynesian effects increase consumption in response to contemporaneous positive government spending shocks. The difference with
the closed economy case is that the New Keynesian effects tend to depress consumption
in response to positive government spending shocks. A pure illustration of the Keynesian effect is initial consumption c0 (for which New Keynesian effects are 0), which is not
0 anymore, but instead c0 = Θ̃n g0 − Θ̃τ t0r .

spending shock. The higher the fraction χ of hand to mouth agents, the higher the initial
response of consumption. At impact, more hand-to-mouth agents means more Keynesian
effects through the spending of hand to mouth agents but less new New-Keynesian effects
through the spending of optimizing agents. More hand-to-mouth agents unambiguously
raises aggregate spending at impact. The effect reverses at some point in time because of
the higher terms of trade appreciation when there are more hand-to-mouth agents (and
current and future government spending is small).

Derivation of the Loglinearization for the Hand-to-Mouth

Assume that c∗t = 0 and it∗ = ρ. The loglinearized equations are

yt = −α(1 − χ)(1 − G)θ + ct +

Note that we have denoted total consumption of home agents by ĉt to avoid a confusion
with ct , the total consumption of home goods by private agents (both home and foreign).
We use the equations the last six equations to get
ĉt = Θn nt − Θτ trt + σ̄−1 σ

Next we use nt = yt together with the goods market clearing condition to get
nt = −α(1 − χ)(1 − G)θ +

Differentiating the Backus-Smith condition, we get (we could have gotten this equation
directly from the definition of st )
ṡt = −π H,t .
62

Now get can get to an equation involving total (home + foreign) consumption of the
domestic good ct = yt − gt which yields
ct = −α(1 − χ)(1 − G)θ + ĉt +

15 We

can check that when there are no hand-to-mouth consumers, this boils down to
