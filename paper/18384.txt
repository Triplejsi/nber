A Cautionary Note on Using Industry Affiliation to Predict Income

ABSTRACT
Many literatures investigate the causal impact of income on economic outcomes, for example in the
context of intergenerational transmission or well-being and health. Some studies have proposed to
use employer wage differentials and in particular industry affiliation as an instrument for income. We
demonstrate that industry affiliation is correlated with fixed individual characteristics, specifically
parents' education and own height, conditional on the covariates typically controlled for in these studies.
These results suggest that there is selection into industries based on unobservables. As a result the
exclusion restriction in many IV studies of this type is likely violated.

Introduction

Many literatures ask about the causal impact of income on a variety of economic outcomes. One example is intergenerational transmission; the question
whether children of richer parents fare better in terms of their own economic
performance (Solon, 1999). Another example is the health-income gradient:
higher income individuals tend to be healthier. Is this association causal, do
richer individuals diﬀer in other dimensions, or does the causality run the
opposite way (Cutler, Lleras-Muney, Vogl, 2011)? Furthermore, income is
an important correlate in happiness regressions relating individual life satisfaction to various economic determinants (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004).
Does higher income cause happiness?
Sorting out causality in these and other applications is diﬃcult. A number of studies in the literature have used employer wage diﬀerentials and
particularly industry aﬃliation as an instrumental variable for individual or
family income. Examples of such studies are Shea (2000) who uses industry
aﬃliation, union membership, and job loss as instruments for parents’ income
in order to learn about intergenerational transmission. Luttmer (2005) uses
interactions of industry and occupation as instruments for income in happiness regressions, an avenue also followed by Luechinger (2009). This idea has
been extended by Pischke (2011), who focuses on industry diﬀerentials only,
and has also been used by Li et al. (2011).
Industry wage diﬀerentials in particular are large and remain after controlling for many covariates including individual fixed eﬀects (Krueger and
Summers, 1988; Gibbons and Katz, 1992) and ability test scores (Blackburn
and Neumark, 1992). As a result, researchers using these wage diﬀerentials
as instruments for income may have a reasonable claim of identifying causal
eﬀects of income not contaminated by unobserved personal attributes and
selection. In this note we provide some evidence to caution against this
optimism. Following the same specifications as in Pischke (2011) we show
1

that industry diﬀerentials correlate with mother’s education and own height.
Both of these variables are pre-determined by the time industry aﬃliation is
measured, and should therefore not be aﬀected by industry choice.
The statistical association with industry wage eﬀects which we find therefore suggests selection in industry choice which correlates with personal characteristics related to parental background and height. These characteristics
might, for example, be unmeasured cognitive or non-cognitive skills or personality traits. We conclude by discussing why we think the types of variables
we use, mother’s education and height, might be useful as specification checks
but oﬀer little hope in improving inference in regression or IV frameworks.
We conjecture that this remains true for even for better measures of the
underlying omitted skills or traits, like ability test scores.

Data

In order to study the eﬀect of parental education we use data from the 1972
to 2006 waves of the US General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is a repeated
cross-sectional survey, carried out every one to two years. The GSS is also
the main dataset analyzed in Pischke (2011) and we use the same sample
restrictions. The primary sample consists of employed men aged 20 — 64
without missing values for any of the covariates used in the analysis.
Our outcome measures of primary interest are happiness and parental
education. Happiness is transformed as explained in Pischke (2011), so that
all results can be interpreted in terms of standard deviation units. As main
parental education variable we use the highest year of completed schooling
of the respondent’s mother. We exclude missing values and those individuals
reporting zero years of education. We focus on mother’s education because
there are fewer missing values in mother’s education than in father’s education. Using father’s education or combining the education of both parents
yields comparable results.
2

Family income, our main regressor, is a bracketed variable and we assign
midpoints as described in Pischke (2011). Industry and occupation aﬃliation
of the respondent are aggregated into 32 and 22 categories, respectively.
Details are given in the appendix.
The wives sample consists of married females aged 20 to 64 with employed
husbands. The industry and occupation variables used in this sample refer
to the husbands, while other controls refer to the respondent.
In order to corroborate our results on parental education from the GSS we
also present results on body height using the US National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS). The NHIS is also a repeated cross-section carried out every
year with about 30,000 to 50,000 respondents per wave. We use waves from
1974 to 2009 and restrict the sample to employed men aged 20-64.
Our outcome measures of primary interest in the NHIS are self-reported
health and self-reported body height. Self-reported health is the answer
to the question “Would you say your health in general is excellent, very
good, fair, or poor?” We transform this health measure the same way as
happiness in the GSS such that results can be interpreted in terms of standard
deviations. Body height is measured in centimeters.
We group industry and occupation aﬃliations of the respondent into 28
and 18 categories, respectively, These groups are relatively commensurate
with the GSS classifications, although a precise correspondence is not possible. Details are in the appendix.

Results

Table 1 displays regressions of happiness on the logarithm of family income
for the sample of men from the GSS. Each column shows results for a diﬀerent
set of included controls. The specifications in each column are estimated by
OLS, 2SLS and using Ackerberg and Devereux’s (2009) Improved Jackknifed
IV estimator (IJIVE). In the first four columns we reestimate the baseline
3

specifications from Pischke (2011) in the sample without missing values for
mother’s education. In columns (5) to (8) we repeat these regressions including mother’s education as an additional control.
The OLS specifications in the first row indicate a positive and significant
association of family income with happiness that is robust to the inclusion
of a broad set of control variables. Using industry aﬃliation as instrument
for family income results in somewhat higher and less precisely estimated
coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcients in the first four columns are very similar to the
estimates in Pischke (2011) although the IV results are slightly higher.
In columns (5) to (8) we repeat the baseline regressions including the
years of education of the respondent’s mother as additional control variable. Maternal education is an important component of a respondent’s family
background. If there is strong selection into industries due to unobservables
related to a respondent’s family background then the inclusion of mother’s
education should substantially change our IV estimates. This is not the case:
coeﬃcient estimates are virtually identical to those in the earlier columns.
These results might suggest that omitted variable bias due to unobserved
heterogeneity in family background is not particularly important. In other
words, selection into industries based on family background does not seem
to be a major issue.
But this is not the end of the story. In Table 2 we look at this potential
selection issue from a diﬀerent angle. Instead of including mother’s education
as a control we use this proxy for family background as dependent variable.
The first four columns display the baseline results from the previous table.
In columns (5) to (8) we repeat these regressions using as dependent variable
mother’s education instead of the respondent’s happiness. In columns (5) and
(6) the pattern of results is remarkably similar to those for happiness. There
is a strong correlation between income and mother’s education. IV estimates
are larger than OLS estimates. It is diﬃcult to think of these results as
causal eﬀects: income diﬀerences due to industry aﬃliation should not aﬀect
4

predetermined parental education. So the obvious conclusion to draw is that
these estimates reflect selection bias. Estimates are lower in columns (7) and
(8) where we include occupation dummies as controls. But standard errors
are large so that this is probably just due to sampling variation as we don’t
find a similar pattern in the NHIS data described below.
In Table 3 we turn to results for married women. Pischke (2011) uses
this group as a specification check. If the correlations between industry
income diﬀerentials and happiness are due to selection we should see less of
an association between husbands industry aﬃliation and wife’s happiness. In
particular, for working wives we can control for the woman’s own industry,
which should be a reasonable guard against selection eﬀects. In the sample we
analyze here the IV estimates for income in the regressions using happiness
for working wives are a lot lower than those for men. This is not the case
in the original sample used in Pischke (2011) where the results for working
wives diﬀered little from those for the husbands. In any case, there is no
evidence in either sample that controlling for wives’ own industry aﬃliation
(which should take care of any selection) lowers the coeﬃcient on income.
Turning to the results using mother’s education as dependent variable
we find much more consistent results across specifications. The IV results
are generally large and well above the OLS results. Controlling for wives’
own industry does nothing to the results. Pischke (2011) took this type of
evidence as support for the causal interpretation of the results on happiness.
Our results for mother’s education cast doubt on the usefulness of the wives
sample as a specification check since a causal interpretation does not make
sense for this dependent variable.
Using the same sample, in Table 4 we turn to the type of instrument set
used in Luttmer (2005) combining both industry aﬃliation and occupation.
We find that mother’s education is even more strongly related to occupation
than industry wage diﬀerentials. This suggests that neither variable is useful
in order to generate exogenous variation in income.
5

In Table 5 we explore other employer characteristics as instruments, including union status used in Shea (2001). Our inference here is hindered
by the fact that the IV results for mother’s education are very imprecisely
estimated. The point estimates using union status and firm size are negative
and numerically large but not statistically significant. As a result, we can say
relatively little about these employer attributes from the small GSS samples.
In order to corroborate our findings further we turn to data from the
NHIS to look at health as an outcome. While health is an important outcome
in its own right another advantage of the NHIS is the much larger sample
sizes compared to the GSS. Unfortunately, the NHIS oﬀers less employment
related information. So we return to industry aﬃliation as the instrument
here. We check the health results using height as an alternative outcome
which should not be aﬀected by industry aﬃliation. Body height is largely
fixed by age 20 (Hamill, 1977).
Columns (1) to (3) of Table 6 reveal IV coeﬃcients slightly below the
OLS results. Taken at face value, these results suggest that a sizeable portion of the association between health and income is due to a causal eﬀect
running from income to health with something of an upward bias to the OLS
results. However, as with our findings for mother’s education, the results
for height shed doubt on this interpretation. The association between income and height becomes stronger in the IV estimates cautioning against
interpreting these results causally.

The results in this larger sample are

more precisely estimated that those from the GSS, and they are very stable
independently of what controls are included.
In Table 6 we use a sample of men aged 20 — 64, similar to the sample
from the GSS used for tables 1 and 2. One caveat with this age group is that
older men tend to shrink slightly, and this may be related to income. To
guard against this we also present results for men aged 20 — 29 in Table 7, an
age group for whom this should not be a concern. The large sample sizes in
the NHIS easily facilitate such cuts of the data. The results are qualitatively
6

very similar to those in Table 6, so diﬀerential shrinkage does not seem to be
a factor in our findings.

4

Interpretation

Our results mirror earlier findings by Blackburn and Neumark (1992) regarding the association of industry wage diﬀerentials and ability measures. These
authors found that ability measures like IQ type test scores are strongly correlated with industry wage diﬀerentials. On the other hand, controlling for
the test scores hardly alters estimated industry eﬀects in a wage regression.
We find the same pattern of results for mother’s education and height. How
do these results make sense, and what do they tell us about various empirical strategies to uncover causal eﬀects in the type of applications we have
discussed, which use income as a (potentially endogenous) regressor?
We discuss these issues in the following statistical framework. Consider
the regression equation
 =  +  + 

(1)

where  is an outcome like health, happiness, or children’s income,  is own
income,  is a confounder, and  is a regression residual, orthogonal to  and
 . Conditional on the confounder  the regression coeﬃcient  is the causal
eﬀect of income on  .  may correspond to diﬃcult to observe attributes
like ability, personal traits, etc. We will also assume that conditional on the
confounder  industry aﬃliation is random. Hence, we can interpret our IV
results as replacing income  in (1) by its prediction using industry wage
eﬀects.
Income is related to the confounder by the regression equation
 =  +  

(2)

The confounder  is not directly observed. Instead, we observe a proxy
7

correlated with  characterized by the regression
 =  + 

(3)

where  might be mother’s education or own height. We assume (   ) =
0, i.e. only  links income with the measure  .
Here, we give some intuition for our results within this framework. We
derive the relevant implications formally in the appendix.

Our regression

results indicate that income matters for mother’s education (or height) both
in the OLS and IV regressions (Table 2, cols. (5) to (8)). This implies both 
and  have to be positive, since  is the only link between these two variables.
Our next finding is that the estimated eﬀect of income on the outcome 
is basically the same whether we control for  in the regression or not (Table
1, cols (1) to (4) versus (5) to (8)). One explanation for the results is that
the noise in the measure  is large (i.e. 2 À 0). This noise is a classical

measurement error and does not matter when  is on the left hand side, so

the measure  is still useful to glean information on whether there is any bias
in the OLS or IV regressions (from the  on  regression). But the noise
leads to attenuation when using  on the right hand side of the regression, so
it becomes essentially useless as a control in this case. This seems to make
sense for measures like mother’s education and particularly height, which
clearly must be very crude variables to get at the true underlying confounder
 .

Variables like ability test scores should be better proxies for   in

the sense that  is larger and/or  2 smaller. However, the Blackburn and
Neumark (1992) results indicate that even ability test scores exhibit pretty
much the same features. As a result the available variables of this type seem
to oﬀer little mileage as controls in regression studies. Our insights here are
not new; they are very much reminiscent of Griliches (1977) in his discussion
of estimating the returns to schooling.
In order to interpret the IV results in this context think of replacing
income with the part of income predicted by industry wage eﬀects. For this
8

predicted income, the relative size of  and 2 may be diﬀerent compared
to raw income (which is relevant for the OLS results). The IV results for
happiness are above the OLS estimates, and this is true for the regression
of mothers education as well. Within this particular framework this has to
imply that  becomes more important relative to 2 for predicted income.
This implies that both the OLS and IV results are biased upwards but the
IV results are biased even more.
Let us make this slightly more precise. In terms of our framework in
eqs. (1) and (2) the variable  is a valid instrument for income. In other
words, the variation in income due to a valid instrument needs to satisfy the
condition  = 0. This motivates using the IV regression of  on  as a
specification check. In practice, few instruments might satisfy the condition
 = 0 literally. Moreover, most instruments use little of the variation in the
endogenous regressor.

As a result, both  and 2 will be lower in the IV

case. We show in the appendix that IV is less biased than OLS whenever
¡
¢
 2 +  2 is smaller for the income predicted by the instrument than for
raw income.  may be very small for predicted income but this is of little

comfort with relatively weak instruments, an insight which goes back to
Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995). These authors show that the relative bias
of IV is related to the size of the partial 2 or  -statistic on the excluded
instruments in the first stage. These metrics are not just important to assess
small sample bias in two stage least squares regressions but also asymptotic
bias due to small violations of the exclusion restrictions in the form of  6= 0.

Conclusion

In this note we have assessed the usefulness of industry wage diﬀerentials as
instruments in regression models for happiness or health with income as an
endogenous regressor. Our conclusion is broadly negative: we do not believe
that industry wage diﬀerentials oﬀer a useful source of variation in income
9

to establish causal eﬀects. This is based on OLS and IV regressions using
fixed personal characteristics as left hand side variables in the respective
regressions, which show large eﬀects.

One obvious, though hardly novel

conclusion from our work is that a healthy degree of doubt about the use of
instrumental variables is often warranted, even when the IV regressions pass
some purported specification tests. Using fixed personal characteristics as
dependent variable oﬀers a useful specification check. We argue that this is
the case even for variables which might be poorly measured and are of little
value as control variables. Such variables should be available in many data
sets.
