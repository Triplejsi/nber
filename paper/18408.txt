Endogenous Liquidity and Defaultable Bonds
Zhiguo He and Konstantin Milbradt
NBER Working Paper No. 18408
September 2012
JEL No. E44,G01,G12
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the interaction between fundamental and liquidity for defaultable corporate bonds
that are traded in an over-the-counter secondary market with search frictions. Bargaining with dealers
determines a bond's endogenous liquidity, which depends on both the firm fundamental and the time-to-maturity
of the bond. Corporate default decisions interact with the endogenous secondary market liquidity via
the rollover channel. A default-liquidity loop arises: Earlier endogenous default worsens a bond's secondary
market liquidity, which amplifies equity holders' rollover losses, which in turn leads to earlier endogenous
default. Besides characterizing in closed form the full inter-dependence between liquidity premium
and default premium for credit spreads, we also study the optimal maturity implied by the model based
on the tradeoff between liquidity provision and inefficient default.

Introduction

The recent 2007-2008 financial crisis and the ongoing sovereign crisis have vividly demonstrated the
intricate interaction between asset fundamental and asset liquidity in financial markets. Liquidity tends to dry up for assets with deteriorating fundamentals when solvency becomes a concern,
reflected by soaring liquidity premia and/or prohibitive transaction costs in trading. In the mean
time, asset fundamentals worsen further due to endogenous reactions (say, default) of market participants in response to worsening liquidity in financial markets.
The fundamental-liquidity spiral is at the center of the academic policy research on financial
crises, and this paper aims to deliver such a feedback loop in the context of corporate bond markets.1
It has been well documented that secondary corporate bond markets – which are mainly over-thecounter (OTC) markets – are much less liquid than equity markets.2 On the one hand, Edwards,
Harris, and Piwowar (2007) and Bao, Pan, and Wang (2011) document a strong empirical pattern
that the liquidity for corporate bonds (measured as the transaction cost) deteriorates dramatically
for bonds with lower fundamental, i.e., bonds that are issued by firms closer to default (reflected
by higher credit derivative swaps, CDS). On the other hand, the recent financial crisis of 2007-2008
illustrates that the deterioration of secondary market liquidity, through adversely affecting the
refinancing operations of firms, can exacerbate the incentives of equity holders to default (He and
Xiong (2012b), hereafter HX12). Taken together, these two observations imply a positive feedback
loop between the secondary market liquidity and asset fundamentals for corporate bonds.
To deliver such an default-liquidity spiral effect, we adopt two standard ingredients from the
existing literature. First, we model the endogenous liquidity in the secondary corporate bond
market as a search-based over-the-counter (OTC) market á la Duffie, Garlenau, and Pedersen
1

Corporate bond markets, for both financial and non-financial firms, make up a large part of the U.S. financial
system. According to flow of funds, the values of corporate bonds reaches about 4.7 trillion in the first quarter of
2010, which consists of about one third of total liabilities of U.S. corporate businesses.
2
For instance, Edwards, Harris, and Piwowar (2007) study the U.S. OTC secondary trades in corporate bonds and
estimate the transaction cost to be around 150 bps, and Bao, Pan, and Wang (2011) find an even larger number. The
fact that equity markets–while being presumably subject to more asymmetric information problems–are more liquid
imply the importance of search friction in corporate bond markets. Other empirical papers that investigate secondary
bond market liquidity are Hong and Warga (2000), Schultz (2001), Green, Hollifield, and Schurhoff (2007a,b); Harris
and Piwowar (2006).

1

(2005). Bond investors who are hit by liquidity shocks prefer early payments, and with a certain
matching technology they meet and trade with an intermediary dealer at an endogenous bid-ask
spread. A novel feature is that the endogenous liquidity for the secondary bond market depends
on both the firm’s distance-to-default and the bond’s time-to-maturity.
The second important ingredient for the feedback between fundamental and liquidity is the
endogenous default decision by equity holders. This mechanism is borrowed from the standard
Leland-type corporate finance structural models, i.e., Leland (1994) and Leland and Toft (1996)
(hereafter LT96). More specifically, a firm rolls over (refinances) maturing bonds by issuing new
bonds of the same face value. When firm fundamentals deteriorate, equity holders will face heavier
rollover losses due to falling prices of newly issued bonds. Equity holders default optimally when
absorbing further losses is unprofitable, at which point bond investors with defaulted claims step
in to recover part of the firm value subject to dead-weight bankruptcy cost.
The secondary market liquidity of defaulted bonds, i.e., bonds of firms that have defaulted,
is important in deriving the endogenous bond liquidity before the firm defaults. We model the
(il)liquidity of defaulted bonds based on the fact that bankruptcy leads to a delay in the payout
of any cash due to lengthy court proceedings, as for example in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy
(see footnote 15). This serves as one of the boundary conditions needed to solve the system of
partial differential equations (PDEs) that describes the bond valuations.3 We solve for debt and
equity valuation, the endogenous default boundary, and the endogenous liquidity in closed form in
Section 3.
Consistent with empirical findings in Edwards, Harris, and Piwowar (2007) and Bao, Pan, and
Wang (2011), we show in Section 4.2 that the endogenous bid-ask spread is decreasing with the
firm’s distance-to-default, holding the time-to-maturity constant; and decreasing in the bond’s
time-to-maturity, holding the distance-to-default constant. Moreover, our model produces a novel
testable empirical prediction that the slope with respect to time-to-maturity of the bid-ask spread
3
This arises because bond valuations depend on firm fundamental, the bond’s time-to-maturity, and the liquidity
state of bond holders.

2

will be greater for bonds with higher distance-to-default. Intuitively, as the stated maturity of
corporate bonds plays no role in bankruptcy procedures, the difference between bonds with different
time-to-maturities vanishes when firms are close to default.
The derived endogenous liquidity allows us to study the positive feedback loop between liquidity
and default. Imagine an exogenous negative cash flow shock that pushes the firm closer to default,
lowering the bond’s fundamental value. More importantly, because bonds of defaulted firms suffer
greater illiquidity, the outside option of bondholders when bargaining with the dealer declines.
This worsens the secondary market liquidity and lowers the bond prices even further. The wider
refinancing gap between the newly issued bond prices and promised principals gives rise to heavier
rollover losses, which causes equity holders to default earlier and thus pushes the firm even closer
to default. As a result, lower distance-to-default reduces the fundamental value of the corporate
bonds even further, and so forth. The outcome of these spirals is a unique fixed point bankruptcy
threshold at which equity holders default.
The feedback loop between fundamental and liquidity is important in understanding the endogenous link between liquidity and solvency in modern financial markets. More specifically, our paper
characterizes a full inter-dependence between liquidity and default components in the credit spread
for corporate bonds. This contrasts with the widely-used reduced-form approach in the empirical research, where it is common to decompose firms’ credit spreads into independent liquidity-premium
and default-premium components (e.g., Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis (2005), Beber, Brandt, and
Kavajecz (2009), and Schwarz (2010)). Our fully solved structural model calls for more structural
approaches in future studies on the impact of liquidity factors upon the credit spread of corporate
bonds; indeed, our ongoing project suggests that our positive spiral may amplify small liquidity
frictions into quantitatively significant liquidity and default premia.
Our paper belongs to the literature on the role of secondary market trading frictions in structural
models of corporate finance (Black and Cox (1976), Leland (1994) and LT96). Ericsson and Renault
(2006) analyze the interaction between secondary liquidity and the bankruptcy-renegotiation in a
LT96 framework. HX12 take the simplified secondary market friction introduced in the classic
3

article of Amihud and Mendelson (1986), i.e., bond investors hit by liquidity shocks are forced sell
their holdings immediately at an exogenous and constant proportional transaction cost. Because in
HX12 the bond market liquidity is modeled in an exogenous way, that paper can only speak to the
one-way economic channel from exogenous liquidity to default. In contrast, our paper endogenizes
the secondary market liquidity by micro-founding the bond trading in a search-based secondary
market, and derives the equilibrium liquidity jointly with equilibrium asset prices.4
We investigate the model performance for BB rated corporate bonds, and show that the positive feedback mechanism between fundamental and liquidity can be quantitatively important for
structural models with credit risk. In our model with the full positive spiral between liquidity and
default, the credit spread is calibrated to 320 bps to roughly match the observed credit spread of a
BB rated bond. As one benchmark, in LT96 model where the secondary corporate bond markets
are perfectly liquid, the implied credit spread is only about 181 bps. This implies that incorporating illiquidity of corporate bonds can be important in explaining about a half of the observed
credit spread. As more stringent benchmark, the HX12 model with exogenous and constant bond
illiquidity produces a credit spread of about 288 bps. Therefore, our calibration suggests that the
positive spiral between liquidity and default (which only exists in our model, not in HX12) can
help understand about (320 − 288)/320 = 10% of the observed credit spread.
Our paper also makes a contribution to the search based asset-pricing literature, as represented
by Duffie, Garlenau, and Pedersen (2005, 2007); Weill (2007); Lagos and Rocheteau (2007, 2009);
Biais and Weill (2009); Feldhutter (2011). To our knowledge, this literature with concentration
on OTC markets has thus far focused on the determinants of contact intensities and behavior of
intermediaries, while eschewing time-varying asset fundamentals and asset maturities. Undoubt4

Another possibility to micro-found secondary market liquidity is to assume some adverse selection with regard
to the bankruptcy recovery value, a path we do not pursue in this model due to the difficulties inherent in tracking
persistent private information. Well-known endogenous market illiquidity models based on private information are
Kyle (1985), Glosten and Milgrom (1985), and Back and Baruch (2004). Besides the advantage of being able to be
integrated seamlessly into the dynamic firm setting in LT96, the search based framework is suitable for the secondary
market for corporate bonds, especially considering the fact that equity markets have much higher liquidity while being
subject to more severe asymmetric information problems. For adverse selection in search markets, see Lauermann and
Wolinsky (2011) and Guerrieri, Shimer, and Wright (2010) (in directed search, rather than random as we assumed
here).

4

edly, asset-specific dynamics are important for the corporate bonds market, and we fill this gap by
incorporating the firm’s distance-to-default and the bond’s time-to-maturity in deriving the asset
(bond) valuations.5 Moreover, our paper demonstrates that, via the rollover channel, the endogenous search-based secondary market liquidity can have a significant impact on the firms’ behavior
on the real side.
Positive feedback is an active research topic in different areas. For instance, strategic complementarity naturally gives rise to positive feedback effect in the global games literature (Morris and
Shin 2009), and a similar effect emerges in He and Xiong (2012a) who study dynamic coordinations
among creditors whose debt contracts mature at different times. Our paper is more related to
the literature that emphasizes the interaction between firms and financial markets. For example,
Goldstein, Ozdenoren, and Yuan (2011) show that market prices can feedback to firm’s investment
decisions through the information channel; Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) illustrate the positive feedback loop between funding liquidity and market liquidity; Cheng and Milbradt (2012) show
how managerial risk-shifting feeds back on bondholders decision to run, which in turn feeds back
on managerial incentives; and Manso (2011) points out that credit ratings affect a firm’s default
decision, which feeds back into the rating decision.
Our paper is also related to the literature of debt maturity structure (Diamond, 1993, Leland,
1998, etc). For the use of short-term debt with a higher rollover frequency, there exists a trade-off
between better liquidity provision and earlier inefficient default. Regarding the liquidity provision
of short-term debt, bond investors hit by liquidity shocks can either sell to dealers or sit out shocks
by waiting to receive the face value when the bond matures. Shorter maturity improves upon
the waiting option, resulting in a lower rent extracted by dealers and thus a greater secondary
market liquidity. On the other hand, equity holders are absorbing rollover gains/losses ex post. As
5
The existing literature often assumes infinite maturity and constant asset payoffs; for instance, focusing on a very
different market, Vayanos and Weill (2008) use a search framework to explain the difference between off-the-run and
on-the-run treasury yields. As far as we know, the only paper with deterministic time dynamics in a search framework
is the contemporaneous Afonso and Lagos (2011), which introduces deterministic time dynamics via an end-of-day
trading close in the federal funds market. More importantly, endogenous default with stochastic fundamental is one
key building block for our paper. Because corporate bond payoffs are highly nonlinear in firm fundamentals, our
closed-form solution with stochastic fundamentals is nontrivial.

5

shown in LT96 and emphasized in HX12, shorter-term debt with a higher rollover frequency leads
to heavier rollover losses in bad times, which pushes equity holders to default earlier and thus to
incur greater dead-weight bankruptcy costs. This tradeoff allows us to endogenize the firm’s initial
choice of debt maturity, and unlike traditional capital structure models an optimal finite maturity
structure arises.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the model, and Section 3 solves the model
in closed-form. Section 4 illustrates the positive feedback loop between fundamental and liquidity,
and Section 5 provides extensions and discussions. Section 6 concludes. All proofs can be found in
the Appendix.

The Model

2.1

Firm Cash Flows and Debt Maturity Structure

We consider a continuous-time model where a firm has assets-in-place that generate (after-tax)
cash flows at a rate of δt > 0, where {δt : 0 ≤ t < ∞} follows a geometric Brownian motion under
the risk-neutral probability measure:
dδt
= µdt + σdZt ,
δt

(1)

where µ is the constant growth rate of cash flow rate, σv is the constant asset volatility, and {Zt :
0 ≤ t < ∞} is a standard Brownian motion, representing random shocks to the firm fundamental.
We assume the risk-free rate r to be constant in this economy.
We follow LT96 in assuming that the firm maintains a stationary debt structure. At each
moment in time, the firm has a continuum of bonds outstanding with an aggregate principal of p
and an aggregate coupon payment of c, where p and c are constants that we take as exogenously
given. We normalize the measure of bonds to 1, so that each bond has a principal face value of p
and a coupon flow payment of c. All bonds have an initial maturity T but differ in their current

6

time-to-maturity τ ∈ [0, T ]. Expirations of the bonds are uniformly spread out across time;6 that
is, during a time interval (t, t + dt), a fraction
over. Thus,

is the firm’s rollover frequency on its debt. Denote by D(δ, τ ) the value of one unit

of bond, which depends on firm fundamental δ and its time-to-maturity τ .
Following the LT96 framework, we assume that the firm commits to a stationary debt structure
denoted (c, p, T ). In other words, when a bond matures, the firm will replace it by issuing a new
bond with identical (initial) maturity T , principal value p, and coupon rate c, in the primary market
(to be modeled shortly). This simple stationary debt maturity structure gives us a convenient
dynamic setting to analyze the interaction between liquidity and default, and we believe the general
economic mechanism identified in this paper is robust to this assumption.
In the main analysis we take the firm’s debt maturity T as given; Section 5.1 discusses the
optimal ex-ante choice of debt maturity T ∗ that maximizes firm value.7

2.2

Secondary Bond Market and Search-Based Liquidity

As in Duffie, Garlenau, and Pedersen (2005), individual bond investors are subject to idiosyncratic
liquidity shocks, and once hit by shocks they need to search for market-makers/dealers to trade.
More specifically, at any time with intensity ξ an individual bond holder is hit by an idiosyncratic
liquidity shock. We model this sudden need for liquidity as an upward jump in the discount rate
from the common interest rate r to a higher level r > r.8 For simplicity, this higher discount rate
persists until either the agent manages to sell his debt-holdings, or the face value p is paid out
when the debt matures. After either event, the investor exits the market forever.9 It is important
to note that this individual liquidity shock is uninsurable and thus results in an incomplete market
and type dependent valuations as explained below.
6

This staggered debt maturity structure is consistent with recent empirical findings (Choi, Hackbarth, and Zechner,
2012).
7
One could also endogenize the firm initial leverage (c, p) based on the trade-off between tax benefit and bankruptcy
cost by following LT96. We leave this exercise for future research.
8
A constant holding cost per unit of time once in the liquidity shocked state (as in Duffie, Garlenau, and Pedersen
(2005)) will deliver similar results.
9
This assumption is for easier exposition, and can easily be relaxed as shown in the Appendix.

7

We further assume an infinite mass of non-liquidity-shocked H type buyers (i.e., high valuation
agent) on the sidelines to simplify the calculations. Lastly, we simply assume that each bond
investor only holds one unit of bond, and indicate the investor who has been hit by a liquidity
shock by L (i.e., liquidity state or low valuation agent).
In practice, secondary corporate bond markets are less liquid than equity or primary debt
markets. Thus, we assume that the secondary debt markets are subject to the following trading
friction. An L bond investor who wants to sell his debt-holdings has to wait an exponential time
with intensity λ to meet a dealer. When they meet, bargaining occurs over the economic surplus
generated. We follow Duffie, Garlenau, and Pedersen (2007) and assume Nash-bargaining weights
β of the investor and 1 − β of the dealer to model this bargaining.
The illiquidity of secondary bond markets give rise to wedges in bond valuations for different
investor types. Define DH (δ, τ ) and DL (δ, τ ) to be the valuations of debt of the high (or normal)
type and the low (or liquidity) type, respectively. Suppose that a contact between a type L investor
and a dealer occurs. We assume that the dealer faces a competitive inter-dealer market with a
continuum of dealers, and at any time they can (collectively) contact H type investors who are
competitive as well. Thus, the particular dealer in question can turn around and instantaneously
sell directly (or through another dealer) to H type investors at a price of DH (δ, τ ), which implies
that the surplus from trade is

S (δ, τ ) ≡ DH (δ, τ ) − DL (δ, τ ) .

The transaction price at which L types sell to the dealer, X (δ, τ ), thus implements the following
splits of the surplus according to the bargaining weights,

DH (δ, τ ) − X (δ, τ ) = (1 − β) S (δ, τ )
X (δ, τ ) − DL (δ, τ ) = β · S (δ, τ ) ,

outside option

Relating to the micro-structure literature, in our model, the ask price at which dealers sell to
H type investors is simply their valuation DH , while the bid price at which L type investors sell
their bond holdings to dealers is X. This implies that DH − X = (1 − β) (DH − DL ) is also the
(dollar) bid-ask spread. Thus, H type investors are indifferent between buying and not buying the
bond, whereas L type investors strictly prefer selling the bond when they have the opportunity for
any β > 0.
The endogenous transaction cost (1 − β) (DH − DL ) captures the liquidity of the secondary
market for corporate bonds. Later we will calculate the percentage bid-ask spread as the dollar
spread divided by the mid point of transaction prices (bid price X and ask price DH ). In a preview
of the solution, by the dynamic nature of the model, the difference at issuance for a say AAA bond,
DH − DL , will be determined by the probability that the firm defaults before the bond matures
interacted with the wedge that prevails at bankruptcy, and the probability that the bond matures
before the firm defaults interacted with the necessarily zero wedge at maturity between DH and
DL .

2.3

Primary Bond Market and Debt Rollover

As mentioned, at any time the firm replaces the maturing bonds with newly issued ones in the
so-called primary market, where the firm hires a dealer who can place the new debt to H type
investors. As dealers are competitive in the primary market, the firm receives the full bond value
of the high type DH .
As a crucial part of our feedback mechanism, the H type incorporates in his bond valuation DH
the possibility that he will be hit by a liquidity shock in the future and thus has to use the illiquid
secondary market to sell the bond. In other words, due to either fluctuating firm fundamental or
changing secondary market illiquidity, the newly issued bond price DH might be higher or lower

9

than the required principal repayments to the maturing bonds. Equity holders are the residual
claimants of any rollover gains/losses. Again, following LT96, we assume that any gain will be
immediately paid out to equity holders and any loss will be funded by issuing more equity at
the market price. Thus, over a short time interval (t, t + dt), the net cash flow to equity holders
(omitting dt) is

The first term is the firm’s cash flow. The second term is the after-tax coupon payment to
bond investors, where π denotes the marginal tax benefit rate of debt.10 The third term captures
the firm’s rollover gains/losses by issuing new bonds to replace maturing bonds. This term can be
understood as repricing the bonds at a rate of

Thus, the rollover frequency

(or the inverse of debt

maturity) affects the extent of rollover losses/gains.

2.4

Bankruptcy

When the firm issues additional equity to fund these rollover losses, the equity issuance dilutes the
value of existing shares.11 Equity holders are willing to buy more shares and bail out the maturing
debt holders as long as the equity value is still positive (i.e. the option value of keeping the firm
alive justifies absorbing the rollover losses). When the firm defaults, its equity value drops to zero.
The default threshold δB is endogenously determined by equity holders, which is an important
10
For each dollar received by bond investors, the government is subsidizing π dollars so that equity holders only
have to pay 1 − π dollars. The tax advantage of debt π affects the equity holders’ endogenous default decision.
11
A simple example works as follows. Suppose a firm has 1 billion shares of equity outstanding, and each share is
initially valued at $10. The firm has $10 billion of debt maturing now, but the firm’s new bonds with the same face
value can only be sold for $9 billion. To cover the shortfall, the firm needs to issue more equity. As the proceeds from
the share offering accrue to the maturing debt holders, the new shares dilute the existing shares and thus reduce the
market value of each share. If the firm only needs to roll over its debt once, then the firm needs to issue 1/9 billion
shares and each share is valued at $9. The $1 price drop reflects the rollover loss borne by each share.

10

ingredient for the feedback loop between firm fundamentals and secondary market liquidity.12
When the firm declares bankruptcy, we simply assume that creditors can only recover a fraction
α of the firm’s unlevered value from liquidation.13 As usual, the bankruptcy cost is ex post borne by
debt holders but represents a deadweight loss to equity holders ex ante. Since the stated maturity
for bonds per se does not matter in bankruptcy, for simplicity we assume equal seniority of all
creditors.
Because one driving force of our model is that agents value receiving cash early, our bankruptcy
treatment has to be careful in this regard. If bankruptcy leads investors to receive the proceeds
immediately, L type investors who are trying to sell their bonds could view default as a beneficial
outcome.14 In other words, bankruptcy confers a benefit similar to maturity that may outweigh
the deadweight loss stemming from the bankruptcy cost 1 − α. This “liquidity by default” runs
counter to the fact that in practice bankruptcy leads to a much more illiquid secondary market, the
freezing of assets within the company, and a delay in the payout of any cash depending on court
proceeding.15
Motivated by these facts, we make the following assumption for defaulted bonds. Suppose that
after bankruptcy recovery is based on the unlevered firm value,

δB
r−µ .

To capture the uncertain

δB
timing of the court decision, we introduce a court delay so that the payout of cash α r−µ
occurs at
δB
a Poisson arrival time with intensity θ. We focus on situations where α r−µ
< p (which holds for all

our examples) so that the recovery rate to bond holders is below 100%. Also, the secondary market
for defaulted bonds is illiquid with contact intensity λB . Additionally, we assume that there can be
a different discount rate rB > r for liquidity shocked agents. We interpret a prohibitively high rB
12

To focus on the liquidity effect originating from the debt market, we ignore any additional frictions in the equity
market such as transaction costs and asymmetric information. It is important to note that while we allow the firm
to freely issue more equity, the equity value can be severely affected by the firm’s debt rollover losses. This feedback
effect allows the model to capture difficulties faced by many firms in raising equity during a financial-market meltdown
even in the absence of any friction in the equity market.
13
The bankruptcy cost is standard in the trade-off literature, and can be interpreted in different ways, such as loss
of customers or or legal fees. However, as we will introduce inefficient delay in court rulings shortly, our analysis goes
through even if there is no bankruptcy cost, i.e., α = 1.
14
This would be the case for example for a CDS contract written on the firm which features immediate payouts at
the time of a bankruptcy/credit event.
15
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008 is a good case in point. After much legal uncertainty,
payouts to the debt holders only started trickling out after about three and a half years.

α ≡ [αH , αL ]> as the effective bankruptcy cost factors from the perspective of different bond
holders. Clearly, the wedge αH − αL characterizes the illiquidity of the defaulted bonds when the
firm (i.e. equity holders) declares bankruptcy. Throughout the paper we focus on the situation
where the illiquidity in the default state is sufficiently high, in order to conform our model to the
regular empirical pattern that bonds closer to default are more illiquid (e.g., Edwards, Harris, and
Piwowar (2007) and Bao, Pan, and Wang (2011)).

2.5

Summary of Setup

The model setup is summarized in a schematic representation given in Figure 1, and for exposition
purposes we omit including the bankruptcy decision that are driven by the stochastic process in δ.

Primary market.

Let us start with the firm. It (re)issues debt to H-types via the primary

market, who value the debt at DH , as represented via the “Reissue” arrow. After the H-types buy
the debt, there is a chance the bond matures before either a bankruptcy occurs or a liquidity shock

With liquidity shocks, an H-type transitions to an L-type with intensity ξ who values the bond at

the bond matures and the L-type will be paid back the face-value of the bond, again summarized
by the “Maturity” arrow. 1/T indicates the flow of bonds that mature.

Secondary market.

Once we introduce a secondary market, L-types can now sell the bond to

H-types via the help of dealers. To do so, they try to contact dealers with an intensity λ, as
indicated by the “Intermediation” arrow. They sell their bond to the dealer for X (δ, τ ). The
dealer turns around and immediately (re)sells the bond to H-types, as indicated by the “Resale”
arrow, for a price DH (δ, τ ). It is important that H-types are indifferent between staying out of
the market, buying bonds of maturity T at reissue via the primary market, or buying bonds of
maturities τ ∈ (0, T ) on the secondary market, as this relieves us from having to track the value
functions of agents not holding the bond.

Debt Valuations and Credit Spread

We first derive bond valuations by taking the firm’s default boundary δB as given. Recall that
DH (δ, τ ) and DL (δ, τ ) are the value of one unit of bond with time-to-maturity τ ≤ T , an annual
coupon payment of c, and a principal value of p to a type H and L investor, respectively. We have
the following system of PDEs for the values of DH and DL , where we omit the two-dimensional
argument (δ, τ ) for both debt value functions:

The boundary conditions are DH = DL = p at τ = 0 because of the principal payment at maturity,
δB
at δ = δB where i ∈ {H, L} as discussed in Section 2.4.16
and Di = αi r−µ

The first equation in (6) is the type H bond valuation. The left-hand side rDH is the required
(dollar) return from holding the bond for type H investors. There are four terms on the right-hand
side, capturing expected returns from holding the bond. The first term is the coupon payment.
The next three terms capture the expected value change due to change in time-to-maturity τ (the
second term) and fluctuation in the firm’s fundamental δt (the third and fourth terms). The last
term is a loss DL − DH caused by the liquidity shock that transforms H investors into L investors,
multiplied by the intensity of the liquidity shock.
The second equation in (6), the type L bond valuation, follows a similar explanation to the one
above. The two differences are that the left hand side now has a higher required return r > r, and
there is the value impact of the secondary market reflected in the last term of the right hand side.
A type L investor meets a dealer with an intensity of λ and is then able to sell his bond (with a

private value DL ) at a price of X = (1 − β) DL + βDH . Plugging in equation (2) into equation (6),
we have λ [X − DL ] = λβ [DH − DL ]. One can interpret λβ as the bargaining weighted intensity
of “transitioning” (via a sale) back from the L state to the H state.17 It is easy to show that
when λ → ∞, debt values converge to the LT96 case with perfectly liquid secondary markets. The
surplus from intermediating trades vanishes because the outside option of meeting another dealer
becomes very large.
We can now define the matrix A that incorporates the discount factors and the effective transition intensities ξ and λβ of the states. Then, the following decomposition holds:

Although the debt values are functions of only the product βλ, the bid-ask spread is given by (1 − β) (DH − DL ),
and thus has β entering on its own independent of the product βλ. This will be important when calibrating our
model, as it allows a separation of the identification of λ and β.

All derivations, because of the linear decomposition, would go through even if creditors would be subject to

A closer inspection of the solution reveals a linear combination (via the matrix P) of two subsolutions each closely related to the original LT96 solution: the first term Ai gives the value of a
risk-free consol bond, the term multiplied by Bi encapsulates the probability that the bond will
mature before default, and the term multiplied by Ci encapsulates the probability that the bond
will default before maturity. Relative to LT96, each of these independent sub-solutions i = {1, 2}

Credit Spreads. Recall that the bond credit spread is the spread between the corporate bond
yield and the risk-free rate r. Given a bond of value D (δ, τ ), the bond yield y is defined as the
solution to the following equation:

D(δ, τ ) =

c
(1 − e−yτ ) + pe−yτ ,
y

(8)

so that the right-hand side is the present value of a bond (discounted by y) with a constant coupon
payment c and a principal payment p, conditional on it being held to maturity without default or
re-trading. For the remainder of the paper, we simply use the ask price DH (δ, τ ) in Proposition 1
as our bond price for the left-hand side of equation (8).

3.2

Equity Valuation

The next key step is the equity holders’ decision to default, given that they receive the net cash
flow in (4) every instant. Because equity is naturally an infinite maturity security and we are

Rollover

where the left hand side is the required rate of return of equity holders. On the right hand side,
the first three terms are the equity holders net cash flows, and the next two terms are capturing
the instantaneous change of the firm fundamental. As mentioned earlier, the term involving square
brackets is the cash-flow term that arises from rolling over debt (while keeping coupon, principal,
and maturity stationary), with

1
T

being the rollover frequency.

It is worthwhile to point out that equity value in our model is no longer the difference between
the levered firm value and debt value adjusted for tax benefits and bankruptcy costs, a common
calculation performed in Leland-type models. This is because part of the firm value goes to the
dealers in the secondary bond market, and part vanishes because of inefficient holdings of debt
by L types. Instead, we need to solve for E (δ) directly via (9), which is non-trivial due to the
highly-nonlinear form of DH (δ, T ) given in (7). The next proposition gives the equity value.

Relating to existing literature, in the absence of debt rollover, secondary market frictions cannot
affect the equity holders’ default decision once debt is in place. Infinite debt maturity features no
rollover and thus no feedback between liquidity and default, and thus the model converges to the
bankruptcy boundary derived in Leland (1994).

Firm value

Following LT96, we assume that at time 0 the firm is issuing new bonds to H type investors only
with a uniform distribution of maturities on [0, T ]. Given the results established above, the levered

Endogenous Liquidity, Feedback Effects and Credit Spreads

We discuss the model’s implications in this section. We first explain the parameter choices in
Section 4.1. Section 4.2 analyzes the endogenous liquidity that depends on both firm fundamental
and time-to-maturity. Based on endogenous liquidity, Section 4.3 illustrates the positive feedback
effect between fundamental and liquidity for corporate bonds. Section 4.4 discusses the model’s
implications on the observed credit spreads.
20

The reader should note the difference that we have one unit measure of bonds, whereas LT96 expand the measure
of bonds according to maturity. We could also define firm value as the steady state sum of the individual valuations
of equity holders and the two types of debt holders, which would result in

where pH (τ ) , pL (τ ) are steady-state proportions given in the Appendix A.5.

19

4.1

Parameters

We present the baseline parameters in Table 1 which are broadly consistent with those used in
the literature to calibrate standard structural credit risk models. Although a thorough calibration is beyond the scope of this paper, we choose our parameters to roughly match the empirical
characteristic of BB rated corporate bonds.
We set the risk-free rate r = 8% which is also used by Huang and Huang (2003). We use a debt
tax benefit rate π = 27%,

21

and set a debt maturity of T = 10 years for illustration. Without loss

of generality, we normalize the initial cash flow level δ0 to 1.
We set the L type discount rate r to 10%. Relative to the H type’s normal discount rate
r = 8%, the implied high-low valuation wedge for default-free bonds (and if investors are holding
them forever) is 20%. This wedge due to inefficient holding is consistent with the estimation result
in Feldhutter (2011).22 The inefficiency wedge is also reflected in the divergence of default recovery
rates αH − αL across H type and L type investors. Because the recovery rate in most structural
credit risk models (Chen, 2010; Bhamra, Kuehn, and Strebulaev, 2010) is mainly based on bond
trading prices right after default, mapping to our model it is close to but above the L type recovery
rate, which we set at αL = 55%.23 For the H type investors’ recovery rate, we set αH = 67%, which
corresponds to a high-low valuation wedge of 12%/55% ≈ 22%, a conservative implementation of
the parameters emerging from the empirical study of defaulted bonds in Altman and Eberhart
(1994).24
21

While tax rate of bond income is 32%, many institutions holding corporate bonds enjoy tax exemption. Thus,
we use an effective bond income tax rate of 25%. Then, the formula given by Miller (1977) implies a debt tax benefit
of 1 − [(1 − 32%) (1 − 15%) / (1 − 25%)] = 26.5% where 32% is the marginal rate of corporate tax and 15% is the
marginal rate of capital gain tax.
22
In Feldhutter (2011), L type is assumed to carry an extra holding cost as in Duffie, Garlenau, and Pedersen
(2005), as opposed to a higher discount rate in our model. Based on the estimates of Feldhutter (2011), for a ten-year
default-free bond, the effective discount of a bond (that is held by L type investors forever) is about 17%, which is
close to our assumption.
23
Chen (2010) finds that across 9 different aggregate states, bonds have default recovery rates around 60%. These
recovery rates are typically estimated from two standard sources. The first is the Moody’s recovery data which is
based on bond price around 30 days after default. The other is an NYU recovery database which is based on prices
as close as possible to default.
24
Altman and Eberhart (1994) document that for senior and secured bonds that went through bankruptcy, the bid
price for the bond at default (which proxies for DL ) is about 52, and the average bond emergence payoff is about 84
which is paid out about 1.92 years after default (the payoffs are weighted average of senior and secured bonds). The
data covers 1980 to 1992, with an average annual interest rate of about 9.3% (FRB release, H.15). Using this rate to

20

We rely on implied bond illiquidity to determine parameters on search frictions. More specifically, we choose these parameters to match the implied bid-ask spread (evaluated at the initial cash
flow level δ0 ) to 100 bps, which corresponds to the transaction cost of BB rated bonds documented
in Edwards, Harris, and Piwowar (2007) and Bao, Pan, and Wang (2011). We set β = 5% (i.e.,
dealers get 95% of the trading surplus) based on the estimation result in Feldhutter (2011), and
choose the liquidity shock intensity ξ and dealer-meeting intensity λ to match both the (initial)
percentage bid-ask spread of 100 bps and the empirical holding time (turnover) of 1 year.25 This
leads us to set ξ = 1.07 and λ = 15.5. That is, investors are hit by liquidity shocks about every
11.2 months, and then it takes about three weeks for them to sell their holdings completely.
The cash flow drift µ = 2% and volatility σ = 20% are standard in the literature. For bonds
that are priced at par, we pin down the coupon c = 1.31 and the principal p = 11.67 to produce an
initial credit spread of 320 bps, which corresponds to the observed credit spread of the BB rated
corporate bonds (Huang and Huang, 2003).
Finally, for illustration we may later use LT96 and HX12 models as alternative benchmarks,
which take the same parameters as in Table 1.26 For the HX12 model, the transaction cost is assumed to be constant at k (and L type investors are forced to immediately sell with this transaction
cost). We set k = 99.4bps ≈ 1% for the HX12 benchmark for fair comparison as to also have a
bid-ask spread of 100bps.27
discount the emergence payoff, we obtain the proxy for DH of 71, which implies a high-low valuation wedge around
32%.
25
According to Bao, Pan, and Wang (2011), the average turnover in their sample is about 1 year. In our model, the
average time that an investor is holding the bond (including the time that the investor remains at H type and that
he is L type but searching) is 1ξ + λ1 . Thus we require that 1ξ + λ1 = 1. And, we require that the effective percentage
bid-ask spread
26

(1−β)[DH (δ0 ,T )−DL (δ0 ,T )]
1 X(δ ,T )+ 1 D (δ ,T )
0
2
2 H 0

= 100bps at δ0 .

More specifically, both models take the common discount rate r = 8% and recovery value αH = 80% as in
Table 1, along with other parameters. For HX12, we set liquidity shock intensity ξ = 1 (which is slightly lower
than ξ = 1.07 given in Table 1) so that the average holding time is kept at 1 year; this choice makes a negligible
quantitative difference.
27
There is a small adjustment to k, because the proportional bid-ask spread (over the midpoint) is bidask =
k
.Thus, k = 1+bidask
1 bidask < bidask, i.e., k will be slightly lower than the targeted proportional bid-ask spread

4.2.1

Endogenous Liquidity
Endogenous bid-ask spread

As mentioned, the (dollar) bid-ask spread is simply the difference between the bid price X (δ, τ )
and the ask price DH (δ, τ ):

(1 − β) S (δ, τ ) = DH (δ, τ ) − X (δ, τ ) ,

(12)

which is just a constant positive fraction of the surplus S. In the following proofs, for better
analytical properties we concentrate on the behavior of S.

Time-to-maturity.

First, let us study the effect of time-to-maturity by fixing firm fundamental.

Formally, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 4 Under the following sufficient conditions

c − pr̂2 ≥ 0, and

δB
[αL (r̂2 − r) + αH (r − r̂2 )] + p (r − r) ≥ 0,
r−µ

we have Sτ (δ, τ ) > 0, i.e. the bid-ask spread is larger for bonds with longer time-to-maturity.
The intuition for this result is simple. Because a shorter time-to-maturity delivers the full
principal back to L type investors sooner, this enhances L type’s outside option in the bargaining

22

and reduces the rent extracted by dealers, thereby resulting in a smaller bid-ask spread. In fact,
by the boundary conditions the surplus vanishes as time-to-maturity goes towards 0, i.e.,

lim S (δ, τ ) = 0.

τ →0

If the bond is almost immediately demandable from the firm, L type investors gain little value from
trade with dealers, and as a result the bid-ask spread vanishes.28 This indicates that short-term
debt provides liquidity for bond investors, and we will discuss the role of liquidity provision in more
detail in Section 5.1.

Distance-to-default. Second, let us fix the time-to-maturity τ > 0 and investigate the bid-ask
spread by varying the distance-to-default (i.e., δ −δB ). Formally, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 5 Under sufficient conditions provided in the Appendix A.4.2, we have Sδ (δ, τ ) < 0,
i.e. the bid-ask spread is smaller for bonds with higher firm fundamental.
The sufficient conditions in Proposition 5 can be understood as follows. Recall that, in Section
2.4, motivated by the empirical facts, we assume that bond investors need to wait quite a long time
before they receive the cash pay-out. It is easy to show that as the firm fundamental converges
towards δB , for any bonds that still have time-to-maturity left, i.e. τ > 0, we have

lim S (δ, τ ) = (αH − αL )

δ→δB

δB
> 0,
r−µ

(13)

We focus on the situation where the post-default illiquidity αH − αL derived in equation (5) is
sufficiently high, especially relative to the bid-ask spread for default-free bonds.29 As a a result,
28

This implies that S goes down for τ close to zero. Unfortunately, for global monotonicity established in Proposition
4, we need some extra sufficient conditions due to the complex nature of the functions involved.
29
The intuition is straightforward: When δ = ∞, so that bonds are risk-free, we have

Proportional bid-ask spread and empirical implications

So far for analytical tractability we have focused on dollar bid-ask spread S (δ, τ ). However, the
effective percentage bid-ask spread ∆ (δ, τ ) is commonly used as an illiquidity measure, and we here
define it as the dollar bid-ask spread S (δ, τ ) divided by the mid point of transaction prices (bid
price X and ask price DH ):

∆ (δ, τ ) =

The percentage illiquidity ∆ (δ, τ ) shares the same qualitative properties as S (δ, τ ). In addition,
as the firm fundamental deteriorates the bond value decreases and thus amplifies ∆ (δ, τ ), this
negative force naturally strengthens our result of increasing illiquidity for bonds closer to default.
To the extent that the percentage illiquidity is more empirically relevant, the sufficient conditions in
Proposition 5 are much stronger than necessary, and our theoretical results should be more general
than they appear.
We plot the bid-ask spread in Figure 2 as a function of both time-to-maturity (that is time
dynamics) in the left-hand panel and distance-to-default (that is state dynamics) in the right hand
panel. The highest time-to-maturity is just the maturity for newly issued bonds, which in the
figure is T = 10. The distance-to-default is captured by the difference between the current firm
∗ = 0.56.
fundamental δ and the endogenous bankruptcy boundary δB

The left hand panel of Figure 2 shows that the endogenous proportional bid-ask spread is lower
for shorter time-to-maturities (recall Proposition 4), and the right hand panel of Figure 2 shows that
the bid-ask spread rises when the firm fundamental deteriorates towards the bankruptcy boundary
Together with Sτ (δ, τ ) < 0, we know that S reaches a maximum when τ = T . The most important part of the proof
is that S (δB , τ ) − limδ→∞ S (δ, τ ) < 0. That is, a necessary condition is that the bid-ask spread of the default-free
bond is below that of the defaulted bond. Unfortunately we are unable to show the sufficiency of this condition
due to the complex nature of the functions involved, and in the proof of Proposition 5 we impose stronger sufficient
conditions.

Interaction between time-to-maturity and distance-to-default.

We now investigate the

impact of the interaction between time-to-maturity and distance-to-default on the endogenous bidask spread. As our goal is to provide some novel empirical predictions, in this subsection we focus
on the percentage bid-ask spread ∆ (δ, τ ) in (14) which is commonly used in the empirical literature.
Similar to S (δ, τ ), under our parametrization we find that ∆ (δ, τ ) is increasing with τ for
δ > δB as shorter maturity provides better liquidity. However, we also know from (13) that, as we
approach the bankruptcy boundary δB , ∆ (δ, τ ) becomes independent of τ > 0, i.e., we have the
same liquidity across all maturities. Thus, when the firm edges closer and closer to default, the
slope of ∆ (δ, τ ) with respect to time-to-maturity τ becomes flatter and flatter. In other words,
for financially healthy firms, the difference between the bid-ask spreads of long-term bond and
short-term bond is greater than that of firms in imminent danger of bankruptcy. Formally, we have
the following proposition.
Proposition 6 Given any time-to-maturity τ > 0, when the firm gets close to default, we have
)
limδ→δB ∂∆(δ,τ
= 0, i.e., the bond illiquidity is independent of time-to-maturity of the bond.
∂τ

25

Proof. When δ → δB while τ > 0, the boundary condition is limδ→δB ∆ (δ, τ ) =

2(1−β)(αH −αL )
(1+β)αH −(1−β)αL

which is independent of τ .
This property is intuitive. Default, by forcing firms to enter lengthy bankruptcy proceeding that
puts all debt holders of equal seniority on equal footing, eliminates difference due to maturities.
For financially healthy firms, default is remote, and therefore the time-to-maturity has a positive
and significant impact on the bid-ask spread. However, when default is imminent, although the
bid-ask spreads for both long-term and short-term bonds soar, their difference diminishes as it is
more likely that the stated time-to-maturity eventually becomes irrelevant. This intuition is quite
general, as it only relies on the fact that maturity plays no role in bankruptcy.
The above discussion suggest the following regression specification:

∆i,t = b0 + bM aturity · M aturityi,t + bCDS · CDS i,t + bM aturity∗CDS · M aturityi,t × CDS i,t . (15)
(+)

(+)

(−)

As shown, our model predicts a positive bM aturity , i.e., bonds with longer time-to-maturity should
have a higher bid-ask spread. Further, the model predicts a positive bCDS , i.e., the bond that
is closer to default should have a higher bid-ask spread as well. These two predictions conform
with the empirical findings in Edwards, Harris, and Piwowar (2007), and Bao, Pan, and Wang
(2011). Finally, Proposition 6 implies that bM aturity∗CDS < 0, i.e., the difference between the bidask spreads of long-term and short-term bonds in financially healthy firms is greater than that of
financially distressed firms. As just explained, this new testable prediction is intuitive and awaiting
future empirical research.

4.3

Feedback Loop between Fundamental and Liquidity

By linking the secondary market liquidity endogenously to firm fundamental, we now demonstrate
the positive default-liquidity spiral in which the deterioration of firm fundamental, via worsening
liquidity of the secondary bond market, edges the firm even closer to default, which in turn leads
to further deterioration in secondary market liquidity.

26

In this section we aim to provide a full account of the positive feedback mechanism between
fundamental and liquidity. Although we will benchmark our results to that of LT96 and HX12
for illustrative purposes, our contribution is well beyond just endogenizing liquidity in credit risk
models. Besides being theoretically challenging, characterizing the full inter-dependence between
liquidity and default represents an economically significant leap toward understanding the role of
liquidity in determining credit spreads for corporate bonds. More broadly, it established an the
endogenous link between liquidity risk and solvency risk in financial markets.

4.3.1

Rollover losses, endogenous liquidity, and endogenous default

The endogenous pro-cyclical secondary market liquidity and the endogenous default decision taken
by equity holders are the two building blocks for the positive feedback loop between fundamental
and liquidity. To understand the mechanism, consider the rollover losses borne by equity holders
as a function of the firm cash flow rate δ. The dashed line in the left panel of Figure 3 graphs
the benchmark rollover losses implied by the LT96 model where the secondary bond market is
perfectly liquidity. There, the (absolute value) of rollover losses

1
T

[D (δ, T ) − p] rises when the firm

fundamental δ deteriorates, simply because forward looking bond investors adjust the market price
of newly issued bonds downward when the firm is closer to default. As shown in the dashed line,
the similar pattern holds for the HX12 model with the constant (proportional) transaction cost
k ≈ 1%. Because of higher refinancing costs for liquidity compensation, compared to the LT96
model equity holders in HX12 suffer greater rollover losses.
The new force in our model is that the endogenous secondary market liquidity further amplifies
the rollover losses. The right panel of Figure 3 graphs the percentage bid-ask spread ∆ (δ, T = 10)
defined in (14). Recall that our calibration requires ∆ (δ0 = 1, T = 10) = 1% for better comparison

to HX12, and the bond illiquidity remains constant in HX12 (k ≈ 1%) or LT96 (k = 0). The
countercyclical pattern of bid-ask spread ∆ (δ, T = 10), i.e., more severe illiquidity for lower δ’s,
implies the same countercyclical pattern of the implied endogenous transaction cost k (δ) in (??).
This suggests a worsening secondary market liquidity for firms with lower fundamentals in our

model.
Relative to models with constant secondary market liquidity, the endogenous search market
depresses the bond market price DH (δ, T ) further for low fundamental states as the implied transaction costs rise. This explains the left panel in Figure 3 where rollover losses in our model (the
solid line) are more sensitive to the firm cash flow state δ relative to the HX12 model (the dashed
line). This pro-cyclical secondary market liquidity is empirically relevant, because it significantly
reduces the equity holders’ option value of servicing the debt especially in bad times, and hence
the firm defaults earlier.

4.3.2

Positive feedback between fundamental and liquidity

The above discussion implies an important positive feedback loop between firm fundamental and
secondary market liquidity for corporate bonds, which is illustrated in Figure 4. For the purpose of
illustration, the following discussion takes place in the counterfactual world of constant transaction
costs (say HX12 with positive constant k > 0 or LT96 with k = 0) to explain how the fixed

to default, i.e., δ − δB . Imagine a negative shock to firm cash flow rate δ. Since this negative shock
brings the firm closer to default, this constitutes a pure-fundamental driven negative shock to bond
investors and lowers the holding values of DH and DL . This force is present in LT96 and HX12.
The novelty of our model is that, a negative δ shock not only lowers debt values, but also
worsens the secondary market liquidity. The lower distance to default worsens the L types’ outside
option when bargaining with a dealer, as default leads to protracted bankruptcy court decisions.
Consequently, bonds in the secondary market becomes more illiquid, as indicated by the left large
arrow with “declining liquidity” in Figure 4. This is the pro-cyclicality of liquidity we already
discussed above.
Rational H type bond investors will thus value bonds less, i.e., a lower DH , because they
expect to face a less liquid secondary market once hit by liquidity shocks. As shown in Figure 4,
the worsening liquidity in the secondary market gives rise to a lower primary market bond issuing
price DH relative to an environment with constant market liquidity.
The lower bond prices now feed back to the equity holders’ default decision via the rollover
channel, indicated by the arrow on the right of Figure 4. This is because equity holders are
absorbing heavier rollover losses (i.e. net cash flow N Ct in (4) goes down), as suggested by the
left panel of Figure 3. Equity holders hence default earlier at a higher threshold δB , relative to an
environment with a constant market liquidity.
The higher default threshold now translates into a shorter distance to default δ − δB . But just
29

as discussed before, the search-based secondary market kicks in again: as shown on the left-hand
side in Figure 4, the shorter distance to default further worsens market liquidity via the declining
outside option of the L type investors. The loop repeats as the lower liquidity now again lowers
effective bond prices, and finally stops at the fixed point δB given in Proposition 3.

4.4

Credit spreads

The positive liquidity-default spiral illustrated in the previous subsection can have significant quantitative effect on observed corporate bond spreads, or equivalently primary market and secondary
market ask prices DH (δ, τ ).
Recall the definition of the bond yield y in (8); since our focus is the credit spread of newly
issued bonds, we study the H type debt value DH (the ask price) with τ = T . In Figure 5 we plot
the credit spread y − r as a function of δ. As the first benchmark, the dash-dotted line plots the
credit spread in the LT96 model with a perfectly liquid secondary corporate bond market. The
more stringent benchmark is the credit spread implied by the HX12 model (the dashed line), which
takes into account the fact that the higher financing cost due to bond illiquidity pushes equity to
default earlier than in LT96. The solid line in Figure 5 gives the credit spread under our model,
which incorporates the full liquidity-default spiral discussed in Section 4.3.2.
Because both our model and HX12 account for the illiquidity of corporate bonds, their implied
credit spreads are higher than the LT96 benchmark without the liquidity factor. The difference in
illiquidity between our model (solid line) and HX12 (dashed line), which surges especially when the
firm is not doing well as shown in Figure 5, is due to the positive liquidity-default spiral effect.
Because in our model the bond becomes more illiquid once the firm edges closer to default (and
thereby receiving a much lower credit rating, say C), while HX12 assume a constant illiquidity
throughout the entire bond life, it is not surprising to observe a significant divergence in implied
credit spreads across two models in these bad states. To isolate this issue, we compare the credit
spreads implied by different models conditional on the initial cash flow δ0 = 1 (thus conditional
on the BB rating), at which we have controlled for the bond liquidity (bid-ask spread) of 100 bps.

δ for our model (solid line), the LT96 model (dash-dotted line), and the HX12 model with k = 1% (dashed
line)

Recall that we have calibrated our model for BB rated bonds to generate an initial credit spread
of 320 bps; this is about twice of that implied by the LT96 model (about 181 bps at δ0 = 1 in the
dash-dotted line). For HX12 without endogenous pro-cyclical liquidity, the implied initial credit
spread at δ0 = 1 is only about 288 bps. Since we have controlled for bond liquidity given the
bond’s initial rating, the difference of 320 − 288 = 32 bps (or 10% of the credit spreads of BB rated
bonds) comes entirely from our novel positive spiral between liquidity and default. Intuitively,
equity holders default earlier in our model with pro-cyclical endogenous secondary market liquidity
∗ = 0.56), compared to the HX12 model with exogenous constant liquidity (δ ∗
(δB
B,HX12 = 0.55).

4.5

Liquidity Premium and Default Premium

It has been widely recognized that the credit spread of corporate bonds not only reflects a default
premium determined by the firm’s credit risk, but also a liquidity premium due to the illiquidity
of the secondary debt market, e.g., Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis (2005), and Chen, Lesmond, and
Wei (2007). However, both academics and policy makers tend to treat the default premium and
liquidity premium as independent, and thus ignore interactions between them. For instance, it
is common practice to decompose firms’ credit spreads into independent liquidity-premium and

31

default-premium components and then assessing their quantitative contributions, e.g., Longstaff,
Mithal, and Neis (2005), Beber, Brandt, and Kavajecz (2009), and Schwarz (2010).
This treatment of independence between liquidity and default is contrary to the data, which
suggests that these components exhibit strong positive correlation. We have seen in Edwards,
Harris, and Piwowar (2007) and Bao, Pan, and Wang (2011) that liquidity deteriorates for bonds
that are issued by firms with high CDS spreads. In an report issued by Barclay Capital, Dastidar
and Phelps (2009) study the quote-based bond liquidity measure directly, and document the same
robust empirical regularity in not only cross-section (investment grade vs. speculative grate) but
also time-series (2005-06 before crisis vs 2008-09 during crisis).
In our model, the endogenous inter-dependence between the liquidity and default premia for
corporate bonds captures this important empirical regularity. By endogenizing the secondary market liquidity, our model points out that the origin of shock to liquidity premia can be traced back
to the deterioration of firm fundamental itself. Thus, both default premium and liquidity premium
are inter-dependent, and the positive feedback loop further amplifies and reinforces both premia in
a nontrivial way. More importantly, this positive spiral effect may be quantitatively significant in
explaining the observed credit spreads (about 32/320 = 10%), as illustrated in Section 4.4.
Another important implication of our model is related to the “credit spread puzzle” in the structural credit risk literature. Structural credit models have difficulty in producing the quantitatively
significant AAA credit spread observed in the data, once calibrated to historic default probabilities and asset prices (e.g., Huang and Huang (2003)). In our model, in Figure 5 there remains a
non-negligible credit spread even for large δ (hence default-free bonds, see footnote 29 for expressions). This is because in our setting the liquidity risk is uninsurable on the agent level and thus
does not affect the translation of the physical probabilities to the risk-neutral probabilities, which
is consistent with the idea that the AAA spread can be explained by liquidity reasons. Perhaps
more interestingly, the positive liquidity-default spiral emphasized in this paper has the potential
to amplify the relatively small liquidity shocks to quantitatively significant liquidity and default
premia. We are performing a thorough calibration exercise on this topic in an ongoing project.

Extensions and Discussions

5.1

Optimal Debt Maturity

Beyond the feedback loop between fundamental and liquidity, the debt maturity features a natural
trade-off between liquidity provision and earlier inefficient default. This natural trade-off allows us
to derive the optimal debt maturity (given the stationary maturity structure). Segura and Suarez
(2011) present a related trade-off in a banking model without secondary markets but with periodic
disruptions of the primary market for debt funding. Although the probability of these disruptions is
exogenous, the severity of the disruptions is determined by how short the bank’s maturity structure
is. This is traded off against short-term debt being cheaper outside crisis states. In contrast, our
model features an endogenous probability of default that is driven by the maturity structure and
we also trade this off against cheaper short-term debt away from the bankruptcy boundary.

5.1.1

Liquidity provision: the bright side of short maturity

Section 4.2 has shown that bonds with shorter maturity have a more liquid secondary market,
suggesting the role of liquidity provision for short-term debt. The efficiency gain due to short-term
maturity arises from two channels.
First, debt holders hit by liquidity shocks become inefficient holders of bonds, and due to trading
frictions the inefficient holding lasts for a while. As detailed in Appendix A.5, the steady-state
proportion of L types as the firm is able to issue to only H types is

and limT →0 µL (T ) = 0. Hence, the second term in (16) is

the allocative efficiency gain of shortening the bond maturity T . Intuitively, shortening maturity
alleviates this inefficiency because of the firm’s superior primary market liquidity: whenever debt
matures, the firm moves debt from inefficient L investors to efficient H investors via new bond
33

issuance.30
Second, a shorter maturity reduces the rent extracted by dealers in the secondary market, thus
leading to a bargaining efficiency gain. Intuitively, a shorter maturity, by allowing L investors
to receive principal payment earlier, raises their outside option of waiting and in turn lowers the
dealer’s rent.

5.1.2

Earlier default: the dark side of short maturity

On the other hand, as first shown in LT96 (and formally proven in HX12 and Diamond and He,
201231 ), shorter debt maturity in an LT96 style model leads to earlier default and thus greater
dead-weight bankruptcy cost. In other words, the optimal maturity in LT96 and HX12 is T ∗ = ∞,
so that debt should always take the form of an infinitely lived consol bond. As discussed, the equity
holders’ rollover losses are

1
T

[DH (δ, T ) − P ]. In bad times (low fundamental δ), notwithstanding

the fact that short-term debt has a greater market price DH (δ, T ), the effect of a higher rollover
frequency

1
T

dominates, leading to heavier rollover losses. As a result, equity holders default earlier

if the firm is using shorter maturity debt.

5.1.3

Optimal Interior Debt Maturity

Relative to LT96 model where the debt maturity affects the equity holders’ default decision, in our
model the firm—being short of intermediating the market for its debt itself—uses the inefficient tool
of the maturity structure to provide liquidity services to bondholders. This extra force naturally
leads to an endogenous optimal maturity structure. In Figure 6 we plot in the left panel the ex
ante levered firm value T V (δ0 ) given in equation (11) for our model (solid line) and the LT96
30

The firm could, instead of providing liquidity via maturity, allow bondholders with liquidity shocks to put back
their bonds at the face value p. There are two important drawbacks. First, if the firm cannot distinguish who was hit
by a liquidity shock, whenever DH < p everyone will put back their debt at the same time. In fact, the put provision
is akin to making bonds demand deposits and we are at traditional models of bank runs. Second, even if the liquidity
shock is observable, there will be an additional flow term ξ [DH − p] dt as L investors are putting back their bonds to
the firm every instant. This additional refinancing losses may influence the bankruptcy boundary in an adverse way
and destroy the liquidity thus provided. The full implications of expanded bond contract terms (beyond the choice
of initial maturity T covered in this paper) is left for future work.

HX12 prove this claim for given (c, p) in the LT96 framework, while Diamond and He, 2012 prove this claim

by maturity shorterning move the value of debt) in the random maturity framework of Leland (1998).

In the right panel of Figure 6 we draw the optimal maturity T ∗ as a function of initial leverage.
The solid line depicts the optimal maturity for a secondary market with baseline intermediation,
i.e., λ = 15.5, whereas the dashed line depicts the optimal maturity for a secondary market with
high (thus more efficient) intermediation, i.e., λ = 31. For low (high) initial leverage, bankruptcy
becomes more (less) remote, and the effect of liquidity provision (bankruptcy cost) dominates, resulting in a shorter (longer) optimal debt maturity. Additionally, for our baseline intermediated
markets with λ = 15.5, the firm provides liquidity to its debt holders through shorter maturity.
In contrast, for a better intermediated market with λ = 31, the optimal maturity shifts out uniformly, and jumps to infinity for firms with relatively low initial leverage. In other words, a better
functioning secondary market reduces the need to provide liquidity via shorter maturity and thus
alleviates the bankruptcy pressure generated by the short debt structure.

Discussion of Asymmetric Information

In our model, the important driving force behind the spiking illiquidity near default is that there is
a significant valuation wedge between H and L type investors for defaulted bonds, as summarized
by the individual recovery values αH and αL . In the literature as well as in practice, an equally
compelling explanation for the deteriorating liquidity of corporate bonds near default is a possibly
worsening adverse selection problem due to information asymmetry. More specifically, one can
imagine that some bond investors have private information regarding the bond’s recovery value
in default. As the firm edges closer to default, the informed agent’s information becomes more
valuable and he is more likely to attempt to sell his bonds. Thus, to guard against such adversely
selected investors, a market maker in the Glosten and Milgrom (1985) tradition would raise the
bid-ask spread.
Modeling such persistent adverse selection with long-lived bond investors, however, requires a lot
more technical apparatus and thus awaits future research. To the extent that an adverse-selectionbased model could conceivably lead to a similar qualitative result if asymmetric information is
concentrated in the bond’s recovery value,33 then on the quantitative front our model has the
advantage of incorporating standard structural bond valuation models in a simpler setting but still
delivering the first-order empirical patterns.

Conclusion

We investigate the liquidity-fundamental spiral in the corporate bond market, by studying the
endogenous liquidity of defaultable bonds in a search-based OTC markets together with the endogenous default decision by equity holders from the firm side.
By solving a system of PDEs, we derive the endogenous secondary market liquidity jointly
with the debt valuations, equity valuations, and endogenous default policy, in closed-form. The
33

If, instead, the adverse selection might not necessarily worsen when the firm goes closer to the default boundary,
we would not expect, absent the bargaining frictions presented in this article, a monotonically increasing pattern of
illiquidity towards default.

36

fundamentals of corporate bonds, which is mainly driven by the firm’s distance-to-default, affects
the endogenous liquidity of corporate bonds. And, through the rollover channel in which equity
holders are absorbing refinancing losses in bad times, worsening liquidity of corporate bonds at
the same time significantly hurts the equity holders’ option value of keeping the firm alive. As a
result, illiquidity of secondary corporate bond market feeds back to the fundamental of corporate
bonds by edging the firm closer to bankruptcy. We hope our fully solved structural model can pave
the way of bringing more structural approach in the empirical study of the impact of liquidity on
corporate bonds.
In earlier versions of working papers, we further incorporate endogenous firm investment and
show that this mechanism, i.e., a feedback loop between the firm fundamental and the firm’s (debt)
financing liquidity, should encompass a broader set of firm level decisions beyond default.

g (r̂) = (a − r̂) (d − r̂) − bc = r̂2 − (a + d) r̂ + (ad − bc) .
If a > 0 and d > 0 and b < 0 and c < 0 as well as (ad − bc) > 0, then both roots r̂1/2 > 0.
Identifying a = rH + ξH , b = −ξH , c = −ξL , d = rL + ξL , we have
r̂i =

rH + rL + ξH + ξL − (−1)i

p

We can also derive bounds on r̂i by noting the following results:
g (rH )

=

ξH (rL − rH ) > 0

g (rL )

=

−ξL (rL − rH ) < 0

g (rH + ξH )

g (rH + ξH + ξL )

=

−ξL (rL − rH ) < 0

g (rL + ξH + ξL )

=

ξH (rL − rH ) > 0

so that we know that
rH

r̂1 < min {r + ξH , rL }

max {rH + ξH + ξL , rL + ξL }

r̂2 < rL + ξH + ξL .

It is easy to show that as ξH → 0, r̂1 = rL + ξL and r̂2 = rH , and limb→0 P =

Proof of Proposition 1.
Applying the log transform δ̃ = log (δ) to the system of PDEs we are left with a linear system of PDEs:

Here we allow for general changes to the coupon payment c by premultiplying by a parameter ρ ≤ 1 to acknowledge
that there might be linear holding costs above and beyond the higher discount rate. In the paper, we have ρ = 1.

Let us decompose A = PD̂P where D̂ is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal elements the eigenvalues of A and P
is a matrix of the respective stacked eigenvectors. The resulting eigenvalues are defined
g (r̂) = (rH + ξH − r̂) (rL + ξL − r̂) − ξL ξH = 0
√
r+ξ+r+λβ± [(r+ξ)−(r+λβ)]2 +4ξλβ
and g (rH ) = ξH (rL − rH ) > 0 and g (rL ) = −ξL (rL − rH ) < 0. We thus have r̂i =

Premultiplying the system by P−1 and noting that P−1 A = D̂P−1 we have a delinked system PDEs with a

The term in square brackets is the cash-flow term that arises out of rollover of debt (while keeping coupon, principal
and maturity stationary), a term first pointed out by LT96. We will establish the (closed-form) solution in several
steps.


First, the homogenous solutions to the ODE are M δ̃ = eκ1 δ̃ and U δ̃ = eκ2 δ̃ where

=

− (κ1 − κ2 ) exp {(κ1 + κ2 ) s}

that limT →∞ VB = x+1r . In the infinite maturity limit, the equity holders care about the illiquidity they impose
on bondholders via the valuation spread between H and L only at the beginning when issuing bonds, but since there
is no rollover their default decision is not affected by bond market illiquidity for a given level of aggregate face value
and coupon.
Next, let us investigate T → 0, which essentially renders the secondary bond market completely liquid. But of
course there is a large effect of T → 0 on the bankruptcy decision of the equity holders. Using L’Hopital’s rule, we

Outline of the proof:
˙ as a function of τ only changes sign once.
1. Show that LHS
2. Show, when τ is small, that LHS increases, that is
˙ (δ, τ ) > 0.
LHS
3. Show that LHS (δ, ∞) ≥ 0.
4. Show that
S (δB , τ ) − lim S (δ, τ ) > 0
δ→∞

Then we are done: (1.) implies that the can at most be one local extrema. By (2.), we know that there is a local
maximum in LHS in terms of τ , i.e., LHS has to go up and then down again to approach from above the value in (3.),
which is zero or something positive. Finally, (4.) gives us a contradiction if ever S 0 > 0. First, by continuity of the
expectation, we have that S 0 < 0 for some part of the state space (δB , ∞), as otherwise the surplus couldn’t be less at
∞ than at 0. Suppose now that there is an interval on which S 0 < 0. This means that there exist a local maximum
2
with S 0 = 0 > S 00 . But this would imply LHS = µ̃S 0 + σ2 S 00 < 0, a contradiction. Thus, S 0 > 0 everywhere.

A.5

The steady-state distribution of types, trading volume

We now derive the cross-sectional (w.r.t. τ ) steady-state distribution of L types. Let pH (t, τ ) be the proportion at
time t of H types of maturity τ . Then we have
∂pH (t, τ )
∂pH (t, τ )
−
= λpL (t, τ ) − ξpH (t, τ )
∂t
∂τ
as when time advances, maturity shrinks. To impose a steady-state, we note that ∂pH∂t(t,τ ) = 0 and that pH (t, T ) = 1,
i.e., at any time t, due to the firm being able to issue to only H types, the proportion of H types with the longest
maturity T is always 1. Further note that pH + pL = 1, ∀τ , so that in the end we have
−

∂pH (τ )

Steady state in the search market

So far, we have assumed that the intermediation intensity λ is exogenously determined by the dealers. This assumption
hinges on the fact that we assume an infinite mass of H type buyers waiting on the sideline who do not hold the
asset, but in order to buy have to go through a dealer. We can relax these assumptions in several ways without
substantially changing the model.
However, the two assumptions we will not relax are that (i) orders are ’batched’ in the sense that there is no
difference in intermediation intensities between different maturities τ ∈ [0, T ], and (ii) that dealers extract all the
surplus when bargaining with H type buyers. Relaxing (i) would destroy our closed form solution without providing
much more insight.
The problem with relaxing (ii) is more subtle: by removing dealers and allowing direct negotiation between H
and L types we essentially (except in extreme circumstances) leave some surplus beyond their own valuation to the
H type buyers. If we assume that we have an infinite mass of H type buyers on the sideline, this would not change
their behavior as every single one of the buyers expects never to have the opportunity to be able to buy and make a
surplus. However, if there is only a finite mass of H type buyers waiting on the sideline (as we will allow later on),
then (a) the firm’s pricing at issuance will be affected as it will have to entice H type buyers to participate instead
of waiting and buying for a discount in the secondary market, (b) we now have to track the value function of the
H and L types who do not hold the asset, and (c) the expected surplus for an H type not holding the asset is an
integral over all possible maturities he might encounter. This sufficiently complicates the equations to render them
not solvable by the methods we employed in this paper, while not adding more insights. In a follow up project, we
can easily incorporate a dealer-less market by giving up the deterministic maturity dimension.
First, we can easily relax the model to allow for random transitioning back from the L to the H state for
bondholders, say with intensity ζ. Then we can simply use our current valuation formulas, but with λβ + ζ taking
the place of λβ. Also, the impact on trade-volume can be easily handled but for brevity is not shown here.
Second, with this switching back intensity, we can also close the model to have 4 different finite population
measures — H types with and without the bond, and L types with and without the bond under the assumption
that a dealer will only intermediate a trade once he found a buying party (H type) and leave no surplus to the H
type buyer. This then allows us, in the tradition of most search models, to define the meeting intensity λ as some
function of the steady-state masses of these populations, especially of the mass H types without the bond trying to
buy and the mass of L types with the bond trying to sell. This would, in steady-state, result in a meeting intensity
λ (T ) that is a function of the maturity structure, which however for a given T would be constant. The valuation
equations would simply include λ (T ) as a constant and thus would not change. The only thing that would change
is the optimal maturity calculations we analyzed in Section 5.1 — here, the firm will take into account the impact of
its maturity choice T on the liquidity of the secondary market, and thus indirectly on the valuation of its bonds.
