I would like to thank Sweder van Wijnbergeri for many useful
discussions on the subject of fiscal policy and the viability of
managed exchange rate regimes. The research reported here is part
of the NBER's research program in International Studies. Any opinions
expressed are those of the author and not those of the National Bureau
