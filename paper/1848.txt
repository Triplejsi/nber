ABSTRACT

In

this paper we employ a recently proposed procedure (Dlewert and

Morrison

{1985]) for adjusting real domestic product and productivity for changes in a

country's terms of trade. We apply this procedure to a comparison of two major
industrialized countries, the U.S. and Japan. The approach is based on
assessing the impact on, alternatively, production or final sales to domestic
purchasers, of changes in terms of trade and the balance of payments Uefirit in

a consistent accounting framework. This treatment of international trade a1lows
for comparative statics analysis based only on production theory. The
comparison is carried out for a relatively

open economy, Japan, with an economy

that may not be as vulnerable to terms of' trade changes, the U.S. for the years
1967 to 1982.

Introducti on

Changes in the terms of trade or the deficit have long been recognized to
have a

potential impact on production and productivity in an open economy. This

impact has, however, proved difficult to

measure

precisely, particularly within

the context of the theory of the producer which generally provides the basis for
analysis of production arid thus productivity.

Diewert and Morrison [1985 have recently proposed an index number method
for measuring changes in production, input use, and terms of trade
ultimately productivity and "welfare

in

response

and thus

to changes in domestic and

international input and output prices and technology. This development is based
on production theory where the objective function is taken to be real product or
sales, and the effect of changes in the terms of trade is

analogous

to technical

change or total factor productivity change.

It is possible within this consistent accounting framework to assess the
effects on domestic real output of changes in the terms of trade and the impact
on final sales to domestic purchasers of changes in the balance of payments

deficit. Combining these impacts results in a measure of welfare change
including changes in

both

domestic productivity and in international economic

conditions.

It is also possible to isolate the component indexes which are combined to

compute the productivity and terms of trade indexes. The impact of changes in
variables which are

exogenous

to the firm can be represented

as individual

price

or quantity indexes within this structure, and thus the individual effects on

the

production process can be assessed.
In

this

paper we use the framework developed in Diewert and Morrison [i985

to consider the differential impact

of

terms of trade or deficit fluctuations on

Measurement Framework

Modeling the production process of firms within an open economy must take

into account not only choices between different domestic inputs in producing
domestic

output, but also the choice between using imported inputs (commodity or

merchandise imports) and/or producing export goods. More than one type of
output must therefore be defined in order to capture the impact on the economy
of the firm's production choices in response to changing domestic and foreign

economic conditions. In this paper we recognize three classes of (net) output

quantities: (i) sales to domestic purchasers (consumption goods, investment
goods, and sales to the government sector), represented by the vector d with

prices Pd and thus total value p.y=Vd; (ii) sales to foreign purchasers

(commodity or merchandise exports), x and Px with value y.p=V; and (iii)
purchases of foreign inputs (commodity or merchandise imports),

and Pm with

(negative) value YmPm=Vm. The impact of foreign trade, therefore, is

3

represented by the extent of export production and import use by the production

sector in
assuming

addition

to domestic production and input use. Note that we are

that all merchandise trade passes through the home country's private

production sector.

Within this structure, the effect of changes in export or input prices can
be assessed similarly to changes in total factor productivity. In analysis of
production taking into consideration only domestic production and input use, it
is standard to represent total factor productivity as the impact of a change in

technology ——

represented by an increase in a time counter t

on production.

This measure must, of course, adjust any total change in output for the

accompanying changes in input use. The result of increased productivity from an
improvement in technology (technical change) can be interpreted either as a
potential decrease in input use required for a given production level, or an
increase in output at a constant level of input use, given a constant price of

output (production). A productivity improvement can therefore be thought. of as
an increase in "welfare' for the economy, since more output is potentially
available using the same amount of input.

Similarly, if the price of an exported good increases, given the use of
domestic inputs, then the same trade deficit can be maintained while consumption
is increased; fewer resources may be devoted to producing exports or imports may

be increased. In either case domestic production

and thus welfare

will

increase. Thus a favorable change in the terms of trade (i.e., an increase in
export prices relative to import prices) is similar to an increase in total

factor productivity. In the remainder of this section we shall indicate how the
independent impact of this international trade effect can be measured, using
techniques that are analogous to traditional productivity measurement methods.
More specifically, changes in both domestic and international exogenous

choice variables facing producing firms affect observed productivity measures.

4

The structure within which to analyze production and resulting productivity and
'welfare' must therefore include these components of the total productivity

"picture'. We assume that the economy's period t private gross domestic product

function or p duct

function gt

1) gt(p,v) E maxy{p.Y

where p = (px,pm,pd)T >>

may be defined for each period t as

(y,v)cft}

is a (hypothetical) positive vector of net output

prices that private producers face, N=X+M+D, P is a vector of X export prices,

p a vector of M import prices, Pd a vector of D product prices, y is a
corresponding vector of production quantities y=(yx,Yin'Yd)' and vO

is

a non-

negative vector of J primary inputs that are available to producers for each
period t.

Jf gt satisfies the usual regularity properties and producers are

competively profit-maximizing, then by Hotellings's lemma the amounts of output
produced and inputs used are derivable as

=

g/p

for n a domestic or

exported good, -y=g/p for in an imported good, and Wj =

g/vj

for j=l,...,

where Wj is the unit price of input j. Note that this is quite a general
structure; in contrast to the usual framework, imports and exports are treated
explicitly, and can be interpreted as inputs or outputs since they are net

outputs. The product function gt is the basis of the first approach to
characterizing the impacts of terms of trade on productivity or welfare; the

sales approach, within which the impacts of the deficit can also explicitly be
assessed, will be outlined below.

Indexes such as productivity indexes and terms of trade indexes are based
on

aggregating

the individual impacts of different price and quantity changes on

the product function g. More specifically, the standard productivity definition
is based on the domestic impact

in terms of production or sales

of a

5
change in technology, given all exogenous variables constant.

Formally, this

can be expressed for the production approach by defining a standard theoretical
productivity index as:
t

2) R (p,v)

t

tH!

g (p,v)/g

(p,v)

Rt is therefore the percentage increase in output, given p and v, that can be
produced by the period t technology set as compared to the period t—l technology
set.

To motivate the formulation of the productivity problem based on Rt and its
extension to include terms of trade impacts it is useful to reformulate this
definition of productivity for the moment in terms of more standard productivity

literature and notation. To calculate the change in output Rt, or equivalently
the growth rate in Rt, it is necessary to isolate pure technical change from
other observed changes in prices and quantities of inputs and outputs.

In

general in the productivity literature, therefore, product:ivity growth

measurement is carried out by taking the total output change between two periods
(the change in product value deflated by the change in output price) and

dividing -

normalizing

or deflating —- by the changes in individual input

levels, to determine the increase in output produced for a given amount of input

use. Thus if productivity is defined as the aggregate output (Q)

to

aggregate

input (V) ratio (each aggregate being some kind of share--weighted sum),

increases in productivity can be calculated as (Qt/Vt)/(Qt1/Vtl), or
(Qt/Qti)/(Vt/Vt—l)
(dlnQ/dt

In proportional terms this is often written as

or Q/Q--V/V. Note that the adjustment of the total change

by subtracting dlnV/dt accounts for only a portion of the
based on g; the total change in g would also be a result of changes

accomplished
change

the terms of trade.

6

The linkage between the Rt specification and typical productivity
accounting methods can formally be motivated using

the

product function written

to include explicitly the dependence ant. I.e., If grg(p,v,t)=g(p,p,py,v,t),
then in Rt(p,v)=Iri R(p,v,t) can be represented by ln g/t, where:

The independent impacts of productivity and terms of trade changes on the total

where terms 2, 3 and 4 on the right hand side of expression (5) are generally
implicit in the construction of PQ which deflates g to generate constant dollar
product Q.

Note that if

is interpreted as the value of the one

product (or aggregated product) Q, p•Q, this expression is the basis for
the usual Q/Q—V/V categorization of productivity. In this case, V/V is the
share—weighted index of the Vj inputs (the last term in (5)), the shares are in
terms of Q, and the deflation of total product by all components of its price is
explicit in the calculations.

7
In

the

expanded form for in Rt given in (5) —-

in

contrast to the usual

the dependence on productivity measurement of changes in

and m is explicitly included. The change in product Rt is thus purged of these
effects and is a pure technical change measure.
Note that the right hand side of (5) allows us to independently assess the

impacts of changes in productivity and in the terms of trade. The in Rt measure
can be augmented by a component based only on terms of trade changes, in At to
yield the following expression for in Wt:

where international trade impacts are represented by At, and Wt captures

productivity plus the effects on consumption of terms of trade changes. This
indicator more closely reflects "welfare" than a typical productivity measure

since increasing consumption is possible from increasing export prices relative
to import prices.

Development of productivity and terms of trade indexes Rt and At and
ultimately the combined "welfare" index Wt, requires development of all the

component indexes of (3). These indexes can be interpreted as individual
comparative statics indexes representing the separate impacts of changes in each
of the components of the productivity expression —-- and their individual
elements -— on production.

Returning to a more formal treatment of the problem of computing
productivity and welfare indexes including terms of trade effects, we define
output and input price indexes between periods t—l and t using the reference
period r technology set (representing alternatively t or t-l).

First, to define a real product index (to capture the "Q's") it is
necessary to define output price indexes to deflate the total change in value of

8

output between periods t--l and t. For each net output good n the individual
output price effect in terms of the reference input vector v is defined as:
r =

is equal to the proportionate increase in period r nominal product if the

price of net output n were changed from period t-l to period t prices but
technology, other output prices and the primary input vector v were held

constant at their period t-l levels. Thus this number has a global comparative

which is explicitly or implicitly often used as the basis for productivity
analysis, and there is competitive profit-maximization behavior in each period,

then certain indexes such as (7) can be calculated as translog indexes using

observable data. More specifically, define the commodity n period t Laspeyres

price effect, PtLn, by (7) where rt—1 and vEv (so we are using the period t—
1 input vector and the period t--l technology as reference quantities) and define

the commodity n period t Paasche price effect,

by (7) where rt and vEvt

(so the period t input vector and the period t technology are used as reference

quantities). Then Diewert and Morrison [1985] show that the following global

Note that fl bnb, so that the individual, price effects can simply be

Since P0 is empirically calculable this is an important result; this index
can be used to deflate the total change in output value between period t--l. and t
to derive the implied output quantity change index as:

The individual comparative statics effects in terms of input use can also

11

The individual impacts of changes in the prices of internationally traded
goods can be computed similarly to the comparative statics indexes above.

In

particular, the comparative statics impacts of P and m are structurally
identical to the output price effects for the P and p components of the set of

Define the

AtL, by setting r equal to t or t—1 and taking reference price and quantity

vectors to be period t or t-l vectors respectively. Assuming (8) and maximizing

in

the

terms of trade by

20) At

(/)i/2 d/e,

where d and e are the indexes of the impacts of export and import price changes,
on private product defined above by (5).

As outlined above (see (6)), the index At can be used as an adjustment
index to add the impacts of terms of trade changes to technical change effects
to obtain a "welfare" change index allowing for both domestic and international

exogenous changes between periods t-i and t. The welfare change measure Wt can
be defined more formally by:

Following the reasoning developed in Diewert and Morrison [l985j and the

translog—based indexes developed above, for this function, as for Rt and At, a

geometric mean of the Paasche and Laspeyres indexes Wp and WtL, can be
calculated from observable data assuming maximizing behavior and the translog

functional form (8). This implies in the current context that the geometric
mean of Wp and wtL can simply be computed by combining the Rt and At indexes:

13

The entire development of productivity and "welfare indexes including
terms of trade changes to this point has been based on the product function.
This is a useful framework that is analogous to the typical production function

approach but expanded to include international price changes. This framework is
not amenable, however, to consideration of the impacts of changes in the balance

of trade deficit or surplus over time. This interesting addition to the current
framework can be accomplished by using an alternative function as a basis for
analysis, the private domestic sales function:

yyydd

23) st(pdpxpmvvO) =

p.y +

d,yx,_ym,t;
v0 > 0)

This function is attractive because it depends on not only all the variable
which are arguments of the product function, but also on the merchandise trade
deficit v0 ——

the value of imports less the value of exports (if v0<0, —v0 is

the trade surplus) --

that

the private production sector is assumed to incur.

The s function reveals how much domestic output the economy can produce in time
t, given the availability of the vector of inputs v, the prices of exports and

imports, P and Pm and the ability to have a balance of trade deficit v0 E

ptm•ytm

pt<.yt

It may even more closely represent short

run

welfare changes

than the product function since it directly captures the amount domestic
purchasers receive.2

Note, however, that the long run effect of a deficit will

generally be opposite to the short run effect; i.e., current deficits may have
to be

paid back in the future.

Given the

definition of v0, profit maximizing behavior and constant returns

to scale, it must he true that:

14

The deficit v0 functions in a similar way to a primary input: a bigger
deficit (holding other things constant) will lead to a bigger equilJhrium value

of domestic sales. It therefore can explicitly be incorporated in a development
of a "welfare' expression analogous to (6) hut with s instead of g and an extra
term depending on v0,

st/v.dv/dt, appended in the expression representing

the total change in sales analogously to (3). Then, (5) becomes:

t S

where the extra component of the total sales change indicates the new possible
source of "welfare" change in addition to the previous productivity and terms of
trade effects, the deficit effect.

More formally, in this framework the productivity index is defined
analogously to the product function case but including v0 and expressed in terms

of domestic output. The productivity index Rt(p,v) becomes Rt*(p,v,vO)

st(p,v,v0)/st(p,v,v0). Following procedures elaborated above, we can use this
definition to calculate a translog index of productivity between two periods t
and t—i (in which the deficit has the same sign) which is the geometric mean of
the theoretical Paasche and Laspeyres productivity indexes:

Q0

(29) is thus a comparative statics index representing the proportionate change
in private domestic sales from a change in the private sectors balance of

trade deficit from v to v, with output, export and import prices,
technology, and primary inputs constant. Note that when the deficit is equal to
zero, pd.yd=w.v for each period and c'0 will be equal to one so that;

the indexes

from the product and sales approach will be identical. Thus, if the deficits
are small in periods t and t-l, the indexes for the two approaches will be
close.

A problem exists for implementation of these indexes, however, if v and

v1 are of opposite signs, because in c0 is not defined in this case. As
developed in Diewert and Morrison {l985], a first order approximation approach
can be developed and used as an alternative when the deficit changes sign over

the sample period. The basic idea of the approximation approach is as follows.
Using the first derivatives of the sales function evaluated at the period t data
point, the first order approximations to the theoretical Paasche and Laspeyres
indexes can be computed and then used to form the geometric mean of the linear

approximations. For example, for the index Rt, the approximation can be written
as:

An analogous procedure can be carried out for any other index that is desired.
This nonparametric approach, discussed in more detail in

Diewert

and Morrison

l985], will be used in section VII for purposes of comparison since, as we
shall see in sections IV and VI, these indexes are nearly identical for those
years in which no sign change in the deficit existed.

Terms of trade adjustment indexes can be defined for the sales approach

analogously to the productivity indexes. Assuming that the sales function in
each period is translog (where the quadratic coefficients are constant across
time) and assuming maximizing behavior in all periods, we can show that a

geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche theoretical sales function terms of
trade adjustment indexes is equal to an index number At* that can be evaluated
empirically; i.e., we have

Clearly these indexes are analogous to those developed for the product approach

and pose no sign change difficulties. Again, if the deficit is zero the index
d*/e* is identical to the product function adjustment index d/e in which the

deficit is not taken into account. The interpretation also is analogous.

17

The Rt* and At* indexes capture the aggregate impact of changes in domestic
and foreign exogenous variables, respectively, similarly to Rt and At with the

product approach. These indexes can thus again be combined to determine the
total impact of domestic and international fluctuations on productivity

to

derive "welfare change indexes including the impact of terms of trade changes:

Again, if c0*=1 this index will be identical to Wt from (22). The Wt* index
captures the combined comparative statics effect on private domestic sales of
changes in export prices, import prices and technology, holding constant
domestic output prices, primary inputs and the balance of trade deficit.
Using the sales approach, impacts from the balance of trade deficit can

also be isolated and used to define an additional indicator of welfare. Since
ptyt +

pdtydt, a bigger deficit increases the equilibrium value of

domestic sales just like increasing production or a higher relative export

price. These independent effects are explicitly identified in the sales
function framework, and can thus be combined to obtain a combination 'welfare"

context the concept of "welfare' includes the effects of increases

in the deficit which cause 'exogenous" increases in domestic sales and thus

consumption similarly to a short run increase in total factor productivity. The

deficit

effect therefore becomes a third component of the welfare index that

appends the changes in the deficit to the changes in total factor productivity
and prices of exports and imports captured by the Wt and Wt* measures.

Assuming

Ii) a translog sales function, (ii) that the balance of trade deficit has the
same sign in periods t-l and t, and (iii) maximizing behavior, we may derive the

Note that the development of

the

saies indexes as translog approximations

has been based on the assumption that the productivity index Rt is defined for
all data points (i.e., we have implicitly assumed that the trade deficit has the

same sign in all periods). The approximation given in (30) can be substituted
for the Rt* .ndex if

is not the case.

points.

III. The

Janese_Data

The Japanese data used for this study were developed from the Economic
Statistics Annual from the Research and Statistics Department of the Bank of

Japan.

The data required are the prices and quantities of output (value added),

labor, capital, exports and imports for each calendar year. The capital and

19

labor series were generated from data on gross fixed capital formation,

operating surplus, consumption of fixed capital, compensation of employees, and

number of employees. Value added was then computed as the sum of the values of
capital and labor. The export and import data, since they are the focus of this
empirical illustration, were generated from more detailed value and "quantum"

data for six different types of exports and seven imports. This will allow us
to assess the impact of the energy price shock in the early 1970's.

More specifically, the data on capital was constructed by using a benchmark
capital level (for 1966) supplied by John Helliwell and his associates at the
University of British Columbia and based on OECD data, and then using the

investment data from the Bank of Japan series on gross fixed capita] formation
along with a 12.5% rate of depreciation to construct the capital quantity

series. The total value of capital (WK.VK=VX) was assumed to be the sum of the
operating surplus plus the consumption of fixed capital. The price of capital
was then computed as VK/VK. Bank of Japan series were also available for total
compensation of employees (wL.vL=VL) and the number of employees (vL), which
were used to compute a price of labor as WL=VL/VL.3

The export and import data, as mentioned above, included the value of six

exports and eight imports plus totals. The export data encompassed separate
information on food, textiles, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, metal and metal

products, and machinery and equipment. The import data included food, textiles,
metals, mineral fuels, other raw materials, chemicals, and machinery and

equipment. The prices of each component were computed by dividing each value by
the "quantum" indicator, which is described by the Bank of Japan as the total

value divided by the unit value. The resulting prices were used to calculate
aggregate prices for exports and imports by using a translog aggregation

procedure. The resulting total values for exports and imports did not exactly

20

coincide with the full totals due to a small miscellaneous component which was
not

provided

with a quantum index. The quantities (or quantum values) were

therefore regenerated by using the aggregated prices (P and Pm) along with the
full total values of exports and imports (V and Vm) to compute the constant

dollar quantity indexes y and Ym4
Finally, value added (p.y) was calculated as

= VL-VK and the

corresponding price (p) assumed to be equal to the implicit GDP deflator

provided by the Bank of Japan. Absorption could then be calculated as

VsVyVx+Vm and the price calculated implicitly as a translog index of the
prices of these components of absorption. These data may be found in Table 1.

IV. Japanese Indexes of Product

'Welfare

Chane

and_Their

The empirical results to be discussed in this section include (1)

individual comparative statics price and quantity indexes b and Cj (and b*,
C*j) for Japan; (ii) combined indexes of different arguments of the product (and
sales) functions a,b,c,d e (a*,b*,c*,c0*,d*,e*) for Japan; and the combined
productivity and welfare indexes for the translog product approach and the
translog and nonparametric sales approaches Rt,At,Wt,R*t,A*t,W*t,T*t,Rt,At,Wt,

and Tt. The indexes are presented as percentage changes and therefore vary
around one; to see growth rates more clearly it is obviously straightforward
simply to subtract 1.0 from all components of the indexes.
To begin the discussion of impacts on production from changes in input use,
domestic prices and the terms of trade it is useful first to summarize the

information available from the raw data. Many interesting trends emerge simply
from consideration of the Japanese data (see Table 1). For example, over the
relatively short time span considered --

the raw data are for 1966-82 —- the

price of labor increased dramatically while the number of employees stayed

21

relatively constant. Compensation per employee increased by at least a factor
of seven during this time period while the number of employees increased by only

20%. By contrast, the data indicate that the capita] rental price increased by
approximately two times and the stock level by close to three times.5 During
the same time span output increased substantially; value added in constant

dollars increased by a factor of almost three. The corresponding price of
output also increased to approximately 275% of its value in the beginning of
the sample.

The pattern of prices of traded goods is particularly interesting. The
unit price of exported goods from Japan only doubled during this time period.
The price 0. imported goods, however, provides a strong contrast to this.
Although the price of some imported goods was actually falling slightly in the
early 1970's, from 1972 to 1982

in response to dramatic increases in costs of

raw materials and especially fuel --

the

price of imported goods increased by a

factor of four. Since these price trends are so different and international
trade is fairly substantial in Japan, explicit consideration of terms of trade
adjustments should have a relatively large impact. on indexes for Japan. In

addition, the balance of payments, VmVx, is increasingly negative over this
period; the value of exports becomes larger over time.
Information on single determinants of production trends is evident from the

individual comparative statics indexes in Table 2. For example, cL in Table 2
shows the impact on the change in product from increasing the use of labor.
This index indicates that increases in the labor input have contributed to a
greater product in all but two years
reversed —-

but

1974 and 1975 when labor growth actually

the effect is negligible. By contrast, the contribution of

increases in the capital stock represented by CX is quite high; in 1970—74 in

particular around 5% of product growth can be attributed to an increase in

22

available

capital. Similar trends for domestic sales are evident from c1* and

CK*.

The impact of changes in prices are also provided by the individual

comparative statics terms b5, b, and bm for the product approach and b*s, b*x,
and b*m for the sales approach. b5 indicates the increase in the value of

product attributable purely to domestic sales price increases. This index
increased by a positive but decreasing proportion from about 7.7% in 1967 to .8%

in 1982. The price effects b*s, which indicate the increase in the value of
domestic sales due to domestic sales price increases, follow an analogous
pattern.

Looking at the effects b, the changes in the price of exports caused
increased total value of product for most years. However, in some years
1968, 1971, 1972, 1976, 1977 and 1978

changes in the price of exports

contributed to a very small decrease in product value. The b*x impacts are
analogous.

The impacts of import price changes on product and sales, the bm and b*m,
respectively, are particularly interesting.

The substantial increase in import

prices during the two energy crises leads to decreases in output for many years.
This is particularly true for 1974, where the increase in the import price alone

would have caused a 7% decrease in total product if not attenuated by changes in

other determinants of the product level. Note, however, that later -

in

1977

and 1978 —— a slight increase in product could be attributed to import price

changes; the aggregate price of imported goods actually declined in this period

due partly to a drop in total fuels imported. The trends in bm* are very

similar to those for b.
The combined indexes a,b,c,d and e (a*,b*,c*,d*,e* and c0*) are reported in

Table 3. The a index is straightforward. It reveals the total percentage

23

change in product (or, for a*, domestic sales --

both in terms of value) from

the previous year. The b index shows the amount that can be attributed to the
change in all components of the p vector; P5, P, and m• It therefore combines

all the b information from above. This index can be interpreted analogously to
its component indexes. For example, the first energy price shock ——
increases in

in

terms of

—— appears to have a large effect on the value of production,

but the impact was delayed until 1975 instead of 1974 because ba and b

counterract the import component for 1974. The c index is similar; it shows
that the combined effect on changes in product of capital and labor increases

has been quite substantial. This is intuitively reasonable since input use is
the major determinant of production growth. Finally, the d index represents
only the impact of changes in the prices of exports; it is equal to b (and d*

equal to bx*). The import index, similarly, is the bm (b*m) index. The
independent effect of the deficit for the translog sales approach is captured by

the c0 index. However, when the deficit changes sign, the c*0 index is not
defined. Thus for purposes of comparison, in Table 3 we also list the
deficit index for the nonparametric sales approach, c0. It can be seen that

when c0

is

defined, c0 closely approximates c0. It can also be seen that

these deficit effects can be quite large; for example, the 1973 increase in the
balance of payments deficit over 1972 contributed to a 5.5% increase in domestic
sales, holding all other factors constant.

Finally, these component indexes can be combined into productivity and

welfare indicators for Japan. In Table 4 the productivity, terms of trade, and
welfare indexes for the production, sales, and first order approximation

approaches are presented. The productivity indexes Rt, R*t, and Rt, which are
computed as a/b.c for the product approach, a*/b*.c*.c0* for the sales approach
and approximate the latter expression for the first order approximation

approach, are presented in the first column of Table 3. The indexes are all

24

closely comparable which suggests that either Rt or Rt are useful

approximations to the R*t data points which cannot be observed. All the indexes
show a substantial decrease in productivity growth in the 1970-71 period and an
even stronger impact in 1973-74

the rates of growth actually became negative.

The post-1975 years were characterized by very healthy productivity rates

although not quite as high as in the earlier years of the sample, particularly
for 1981. which exhibited growth of only .2%. The largest percentage growth in
the post energy crisis years was the "snap-back" in 1976 when growth jumped back
up to 4,9%; this is closely followed by a 4.8% increase in 1980.

The adjustment indexes -—

the

At. A*t, and At, indexes computed as d/e,

d*/e* and an approximation to the latter term, respectively -—

again are very

closely related, and also are very close to one throughout the sample, with the

exceptions of the OPEC price shock years of 1974 and 1979-80. The combined
effect of changes in export and import prices in these years was a decrease in

growth of over 3% in 1974, 1.5% in 1979 and almost 3% in 1980. Thus we are able
to measure rather precisely the effects on growth of the adverse changes in
Japan's terms of trade during these years.

Adjusting the productivity growth measures by these terms of trade indexes

results in the welfare measures Wt, (RtAt), *t (R*tA*t) and W (RtAt),
which all are closely comparable and closely related to the "R" indexes since

the A's are close to 1.0; The impacts of the energy "crisis" are, of course,
more evident in these indexes; welfare growth in 1971 and particularly 1974 was
very low.

Finally, for the sales and first order approximation approaches, the
combined indexes incorporating productivity, terms of trade changes and the
impact of the deficit are represented by T*t (W*tc*0) and Tt (the

corresponding approximation), respectively. These indexes are nearly identical

25

for those years in which T*t is defined. On average the productivity index Rt
and the total short run welfare change index t differed by approximately 1%.
The difference between the two series is of course due to the terms of trade
adjustment index At and the deficit adjustment index c*Ot; i.e., Tt

RtAtc0t

In section VII, we shall return to the Japanese series and compare them with the
corresponding U.S. series.

V. The U.S. Data

The data required to calculate the indexes include price and quantity
information on national output, capital and labor inputs, exports and imports.

We have developed the output, import and export data for 1968—82 from the
National Income and Product Accounts, (U.S. Department of Commerce [19811,
[19821, [19831), and have used real capita] stock data constructed by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics (U.S. Department of Labor [1983]) and real labor data
updated from Jorgenson and Fraunieni [1981), since these series closely

approximate our theoretically ideal indexes.

More specifically, we have calculated the value of output (ptyt) as gross
domestic business product including tenant occupied housing output, property
taxes, and Federal subsidies to businesses, but excluding Federal, State and

Local indirect taxes and owner occupied housing. The corresponding price index
(pt), was computed by cumulating the Business Gross 1)omestic Product Chain

The values of mercahndise exports (pxt.yxt) and imports (pmtymt) were
determined by adding the durable and nondurable export and import values,

respectively, reported in the National Accounts. Tariff revenues were auded to
the value of imports. Corresponding prices (Pxt and PMt) were caJculated as
translog indexes of the components of each measure, and quantities (Xt and Mt)

were determined implicitly. For l967—82, value and price data for nine
different types of exports and ten types of imports were available, which were
used to compute chain price indexes.

Using the values of imports and exports, PMtMt

All of

these U.S. series are presented in Table 5.

27

VI. U.S. Indexes of Productivity and "Welfare" Chan

and Their Comgnents

The patterns in the data for the U.S. vary considerably from those seen for
Japan. For example, the price of labor did not increase nearly as substantially
as it did in Japan and the corresponding change in labor quantity is much

higher. Compensation to labor therefore increased similarly to Japan, but for
the U.S. this was a result of increased levels of labor input whereas for Japan

the price adjustment was more important. The capital trends are more similar;
the U.S. price of capital increased slightly more than for Japan and the

quantity increased a bit less, but the magnitudes are closely comparable. The
output trend is analogous to that for capital; the volume of output increased

more in Japan and price increased less than for the U.S. The import and export
price and quantity trends also follow expected patterns. Import prices
increased substantially in the U.S., particularly post-1973, but not as much as
for Japan, and the increase in quantity of imports is similar for the two

countries. By contrast, export price increases are more substantial. for the
U.S. and the corresponding increase in exports is much lower than for Japan.

Specific growth effects for the U.S. are presented in Table 6. The labor
impact is different than for Japan, as would be expected from the differing
labor trends; increases in the labor input in the U.S. have contributed to
greater product except in the worst recession years including 1970, 1975 and

1982. Overall the contribution is strongly positive (and more so than in Japan
which can be seen by the means of the respective CL indexes). The positive
impact of the capital stock is, by contrast, always positive but fluctuates less
and the overall impact is less than for Japan, as is also evident from the
reported means. The individua.l price impacts are particularly interesting for

28

the U.S.; although the export price effects b and b*x caused increased product
value in the U.S. in every year except 1982, changes in the price of imports

reflected by bm and b*m caused decreased product value except in 1982. The
overall impacts are, however, especially for the earlier years, very small in

magnitude. By contrast, the increase in product value from domestic price
increases is positive and quite large throughout; it does not show the declining

effect over time that is found for Japan. Domestic and export prices remained
relatively high over the time period in the U.S. as compared to Japan.
The combined components of the productivity indexes for each type of
effect; a, the change in product quantity alone; b, the change from all
components of the price vector; C,

the change from the combined input effects; d

and e, the impact of exports and imports respectively; and c0, the deficit

effect, are presented in Table 7. These combined indexes are interpreted
analogously to the individual impacts. For example, the c index indicates that
the impact of changes in input on production growth has been quite substantial

and positive, as one would expect. The d and e indexes are simply the b and
bm indexes. Note finally that the deficit effect is generally very small for
the U.S.

The productivity and "welfare' indexes for the U.S. presented in Table 8
are combinations of the individual component indexes from Tables 6 and 7.

The productivity growth measure from the product approach, Rt, and its
corresponding measures from the sales and first order approximation approaches,

R*t and Rt, are presented in the first column in Table 8. Note that these
multifactor productivity indexes are quite similar, and capture large drops in

productivity in 1970, 1975, 1979—80 and especially 1982. 1975 and 1976 were

poor productivity years -

there

was a 2% decrease in productivity ---

which

caused concern in the late 1970's about the observed "productivity slowdown".

29

The late 1960s were also disappointing and 1977 appeared very strong in terms
of productivity growth. In addition, 1980 exhibited a 2% productivity decline
and 1982 was catastrophic with a 6% drop in productivity. These patterns
suggest that productivity trends cannot be characterized by a unique

productivity downturn in 1973, although there does appear to be a trend toward
deterioration of productivity growth over time, much of which can be attributed
to output fluctuations represented by a/b.

To incorporate the effects on U.S. "welfare" of changes in the terms of
trade in addition to changes in technical efficiency, the adjustment index
At =

d/e

and the corresponding indexes for the sales and first order

approximations approaches, A*t and At must be calculated. These indexes are
generally very close to 1.0, since internationally traded goods are such a small
proportion of total output. for the U.S. , even in the most recent years of the

sample. However, in 1974 and 1980 (two energy shock years), increases in the
prices of imported goods relative to exported goods were responsible for
declines in real output of about 1 1/2% in each year.
With the exception of these two years, the "welfare" index Wt, obtained by

multiplying Rt and At (and analogously W and Wt for the sales and first order
approximation approaches) does not vary significantly from Rt; for a relatively
closed economy like the U.S., improvements in the terms of trade have a
relatively small effect on economic welfare defined in this manner.
With the sales approach we can also assess changes in the deficit.
Incorporating the deficit effect into the definition of welfare results in

Tt*=Wt*.c0* for the sales approach and similarly Tt for the first order
approximation approach. The impact of multiplying by c0 was small, as one
would expect from considering the deviations of c0* from one in Table 7. The
exception to this is 1977. where the increase in the trade deficit relative to
1976 was large enough to account for an approximate 1.6% gain in real output.

30

Although the indexes discussed above are illuminating

are

4If

individually, they

particularly interesting to compare across countries. For ease of

comparison, in Table 9, productivity, terms of trade and welfare indexes for the
product and first order approximation approaches are presented for both Japan

and the U.S. for 1968-82. The indexes based on the product approach are
presented because of the strong theoretical foundation for the translog

treatment developed in Diewert and Morrison 11985] and outlined above. The
first order approximation indexes are reported for comparison because the
deficit effect can be captured within this framework and yet all the components
of the indexes can be identified.

The first indexes to consider are those for productivity. Rt. The Japanese
indexes show only two years of decline throughout the sample period, 1971 and
1974, whereas the U.S. indexes show declines in productivity in many years,

including 1969-70, 1975-76, and 1979-82. This is a large portion of a sample

that includes only 15 data points. The growth in productivity over the entire
sample period for Japan was large relative to the U.S., and showed a gradual
decline from around 6 to 3 percent per year, although there is a lot of

fluctuation around the trend. The worst years for Japan were worse than the
worst years for the U.S., but those years were very limited, over all, both
countries experienced a decreasing trend in yearly productivity growth over the
sample period, but the U.S. decline was more pronounced, and the average level
was substantially lower.

The U.S. pattern of productivity is different not only in levels but also

in terms of timing and directions of change. For example, although for Japan

31

1974 was a disastrous year, with a productivity decline of more than 2.5%, there
are indications of a snap back in productivity growth as early as 1975. For the
U.S., 1975 and 1976 were both bad years with productivity declines of almost 2%
per year.

terms of trade adjustment indexes also are interesting to compare.
Although the At indexes are close to 1.0 for Japan, they are even closer to 1.0
for the U.S. This is intuitively reasonable both because
the magnitude of trade
The

to GNP is large in Japan as compared to the

relative
pattern

than

U.S., and because the

of export prices as compared to import prices differs more

for Japan

the U.S. This difference in price patterns at least partly results because

Japan is more dependent on imported raw materials, especially fuels, than is the

U.S. For example, the 1974 value of At for Japan, .969, is the lowest value
over the sample period because of the impact of energy price increases. This
value indicates a decrease in potential product of about 3% in response only to

the change in the relative prices of traded goods. This corresponds to a U.S.
value of .986 in 1974, the second lowest value in the sample, indicating a

smaller 1.4% drop. On average the Japanese terms of trade adjustment values
tend to be slightly lower than for the U.S. and lower than unity; the means are

.995 and .977 respectively. This indicates a lower level of welfare overall
than is suggested by the pure productivity measures Rt, due to changes in the
terms of trade.

Adjustment of the productivity measures by the At indexes to derive the Wt
indexes has little effect on the comparative welfare found for Japan and the

U.S. The overall tendency is that the welfare indicators remain similar to the
productivity indexes, although welfare growth is slightly lower than
productivity growth, especially for the later years and for Japan.

32

For example, the 1982 numbers indicate both the worst productivity growth

and the worst welfare growth for the U.S. during the sample period. Welfare
growth is, however, slightly less disastrous; productivity dropped by 5.9%

whereas welfare declined by 5.6%. Conversely, the best productivity growth year
for the U.s., 1973, where productivity increased by approximately 2.9%, becomes
slightly worse -- 2.8% -- when the terms of trade adjustment is made. By

contrast, the worst productivity growth in Japan was found in 1974, where a 2.6%

drop in productivity corresponded to a 5.6% decline in welfare. The terms of
trade adjustment for Japan also transforms a strong increase in productivity
growth of 4.8% to 1.9% in 1980 although at the beginning of the sample high
productivity growth rates of more than 6% correspond to even higher welfare
measures --

close to 7% in 1967. The terms of trade adjustment therefore has a

more substantial impact on the relative welfare patterns in Japan than in the
U.S.

The Tt indexes including the adjustment for the deficit effect are also

presented in Table 9. The pattern of this adjustment is similar to that of the
adjustment to Wt from Rt. The U.S. numbers for the early 1980ts indicate a less
dramatic decrease in welfare growth toward the end of the sample with the

deficit effect incorporated than was found for productivity growth, although the

difference is negligible. By contrast, decreases in productivity earlier in the
sample (such as -2.1% for 1970) appear slightly worse with the deficit

transformation (-2.4%). The deficit adjustment for Japan also causes some of
the earlier years to appear worse, for example the 1971 drop in welfare becomes

greater than 4%. However, the effect on some later years is more negative and
dramatic; welfare growth in 1981 actually appears negative and the welfare
increase of 1.93% in 1980 is substantially worse than the 4.8% growth in
productivity, although slightly larger than the 1.86% for t. On average the

33

deficit

effect causes welfare growth in Japan to appear worse than indicated by

Wt, whereas the reverse is true for the U.S.

It is useful to focus on the last years of the sample both because this
period was one of: large fluctuations in growth of all industrial countries and

because the major differences resulting from adjustments of productivity growth

measurements to compute welfare growth appear in these years. The final
comparison to be made here, therefore, is in terms of average growth rates to

summarize the overall trends across time periods. These average growth rates
for both Japan and the U.S. are presented in Table 10.

For the traditional productivity measures Rt and Rt the difference
between the 1968-82 percentage productivity growth average is striking; the U.S.
experienced a decline overall in this period of approximately .1% per year,
whereas Japan experienced an increase in productivity of a strong 3.0% per year.
This discrepancy in productivity growth does not appear only after 1973,

however. Although the pre—1973 average for the U.S. is a positive .8% growth,

for Japan the corresponding rate of growth is almost 4%. The decline in
productivity is, however --

at

least on average —— a post-1973 effect. For the

1973-82 period the U.S. experienced a .35% decrease in productivity per year
(although a .26% increase if 1982 is dropped) and the corresponding 2.6% growth

experienced by Japan is lower than the pre-1973 rate of 4%, but still very high
by international standards.

The trends in percentage growth captured in subperiods between the two OPEC

shocks for the two countries also differs strongly. The 1973-77, and 1977—82
breakdown represents a first period including the first shock and beginning of
the recovery and a second period including the rest of the recovery phase and
second

OPEC shock. This break corresponds to the end of the sample period for

many studies studies from

the

iate l970s which assessed the devastating results

of the energy price increases. These numbers pose some interesting questions.

34

For the U.S. the usual post—1973 productivity slowdown appears in modified
form; the 1968-73 numbers are larger (.8%/year) than 1973-77 (68%/year)
although not by a large margin because of' the bad productivity growth

experienced in 1969-70. The 977-82 numbers, however, are catastrophic;
productivity decreased in this period by about .65%. Much

of

this decrease can

be attributed, however, to 1982 since the 1977-81 percentage average growth is a

positive .5%. This trend downwards, of course, hides the significant
oscillations within the sub-periods; 1977 and 1978 were, for example, quite good
years for productivity growth whereas 1970 was poor.
The Japanese averages indicate very different trends. First, the l9'73-77
sub—period was a period of significantly lower annual productivity growth (2.1%)
than 1968-73 (3.7%) .

The 1977-82 growth rate shows, however, a strong 'snap-

back" effect, even while including the second OPEC shock; the productivity
growth rate jumps back up to 3.1%. The productivity growth trend for Japan,
therefore, does not appear to be steadily downward as it does for the U.S.,
although the U.S. had a couple of good years in the late 1970's.
Adjustment by terms of trade effects -deficit effects --

to

to

the Wt and Wt measures —- and by

the Tt index —- change these patterns slightly but not

dramatically. One point already noted about the Japanese productivity trends is
that the post—1977 period appears weaker in terms of' welfare as compared to the

productivity trends, although for pre—1977 the adjustments have a much larger

impact; welfare growth in the 1973-77 period is only 1.2% per year. The
tendency toward a "welfare" slowdown and sluggish recovery in Japan is thus

stronger than it appeared from the Rt indexes. This same tendency is evident in
the U.S. indexes, but it is not as strong; welfare decreases appear greater than
1% per year for 1977-82 with the terms of trade adjustment (although when 1982
is dropped this becomes a decrease of .2%) and with the deficit adjustment the

35

corresponding decrease is .7% (--l6%), which is very close to the traditional
productivity measure.

VIII. Concludingjemarks

Although the many theoretical and empirical results discussed in this paper
cannot easily be summarized, it is useful to highlight some of these points to
provide an overview of the contribution provided by this study.

First, it must be recognized that productivity measures, although
important, may obscure significant contributions to short run welfare that are

obtained by international trade. In this paper we have outlined, following a
more rigorous treatment by Diewert and Morrison [l985, a method which can
distinguish these additional "welfare" changes, resulting from changes in the

terms of trade and the deficit, from productivity changes. To motivate and
develop this approach we have used a production theory based framework similar
to that which provides a basis for much of the productivity literature.

This framework is used &o construct productivity, terms of trade adjustment
and welfare indexes for the U.S. and Japan as combinations of individual
comparative statics indexes representing the effects of output production,

domestic output price, input use, the deficit, and export and import price
changes on growth in production or sales.

These indexes show that Japan's productivity from 1968 to 1982 has been
significantly greater than for the U.S. —- and in

positive

has been strongly

in almost all. years whereas productivity and welfare has been

relatively
Japan's

fact

low in

the U.S. An interesting implication of these numbers is

that

productivity growth appears not to have been declining as significantly

as the U.S.; Japan experienced a minimal number of very poor productivity growth

36

years around the first OPEC energy price shock and then "snapped hack'

relatively quickly, although not completely. In addition, adjusting by the
relative terms of trade faced, and the deficit incurred, by the countries has a
greater impact for Japan than the U.S. and smaller productivity growth in post—
1973 and especially

197377 than appears in productivity numbers. For the U.S. this is also true,
although the effect is later; the most dramatic (negative) effects of the terms

of trade adjustment are evident after 1977. Once the terms of trade and deficit
effects are explicitly taken into account it appears for both countries for this
time period that traditional productivity measures understate short run
welfare.

These implications are obviously only a small subset of those which these
indexes provide, but highlight the richness of the information available from

the procedures developed. Application of these procedures to later and more
complete data for these and other countries should provide very useful
indications of the effects of trade patterns on economic welfare.

Two other approximations were also tried for purposes of comparison.
These
included dividing the compensatjot of labor series by the
average
month
hours
per worker to generate a price of labor
series and using "cash earnings pe
regular worker" to approximate a labor price.
These two methods resulted In
series which bounded tile price of labor data used in the study.

It appeared important,
particularly for mineral fuels, to decompose these
indexes to allow for the individual
impacts of the different categories to
appear: the fuel component of imports exhibited
a dramatic jump in value and
price in the 1974 data
which is important to capture explicitly.

This

even though the depreciation rate was assumed to
l2.5 occursThis
assumption was made as a result of evidence

be quite high -—
that replacement
investment is a significantjy higher
portion of total investment relative to
the U.S. experience.

The BLS labor quantity series is
an unweighted manhours series and hence is
unsuitable for our purposes. We wish to thank Mike Harper at BLS and Barbara
Fraumeni for their help in providing the updated data series.
