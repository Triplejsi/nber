paper presents a comparative analysis of productivity growth in the
U.S. and Japanese electrical machinery Industries in the postwar period. This
industry has experienced rapid growth in output and productivity and high rates
of capital formation in both countries. A substantial amount of R&D resources
of the total manufacturing sectors in both countries is concentrated In the
electrical machinery Industry. Also, this industry has an active export orientation in both countries.
The analysis of the paper is based on dynamic factor demand models
describing the production structure and the behavior of factor inputs as well as
the determinants of productivity growth in the U.S. and Japanese electrical
machinery Industry. The analysis shows that the production structure of the
industry in both countries is characterized by increasing returns to scale; the
factors of production do respond to changes In factor prices; and the existence
of a pattern of substitution and complenientarity among the inputs. The main
sources of productivity growth are: growth in materials; technical change; and
capital accumulation. R&D expenditures have also contributed significantly to
growth of labor and productivity while the most important source of total factor
productivity in this industry for both countries has been the scale effect
followed by changes in technical progress.

Introduction1

During the 1970's the growth rates of labor productivity in the Japanese
manufacturing sector dramatically exceeded those in the United States,
particularly in such key industries as primary metals, chemicals, electrical

machinery

and transportation equipment. This enabled

the Japanese

to reach

and eventually surpass levels of U.S. labor productivity in these industries
(Grossman (1985)). Although each of these industries is a key competitor to
the U.S. high technology industries in both the U.S. domestic and in the world

market, the electrical machinery industry stands out In certain respects. It
has experienced very rapid growth In output and productivity and high rates of

capital formation both in the U.S. and Japan. Also, a substantial amount of
R&D resources - over 20% of total R&D expenditures in total manufacturing — Is

concentrated in this industry In both countries. Furthermore, Japan has
increased its share of free world export in electrical machinery from 22% in
1971 to 148% in 1981 as well as dramatically increased its share of U.S.
imports of electrical machinery products over the same period (Grossman
(1985)).

Because of these characteristics, we have chosen to examine

the

performance of this Industry In the U.S. and Japan. The analysis
is based on a dynamic factor demand model. Since output growth has been
productivity

fairly high in the electrical machinery industry both in the U.S. and Japan,
we have not imposed a priori constant returns to scale. Returns to scale are
estimated from the data. Furthermore, we allow some of the input factors to
be quasi—fixed and model adjustment costs explicitly. Since the rate of R&D
investment in the electrical machinery industry has been very rapid, we have
also incorporated R&D explicitly as one of the inputs. Other factor inputs

considered are labor (hours worked), materials and capital. Using the

—2--

structural parameter estimates, we analyze the sources of growth in output,

labor productivity

and total factor productivity.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we provide a brief
description of the behavior of productivity growth as well as inputs and

output

growth

in the electrical machinery industries of the U.S. and Japan.

Section III describes the properties and structure of our analytical model.
In Section IV we describe the results obtained by estimating the model using

annual data. We report output and price elasticities of the variable and
quasi-fixed factors of production in the short, intermediate and long—run and
calculate the speeds of adjustment of the quasi—fixed factors — physical and

R&D capital. Section V is devoted to the examining the sources of output and

factor productivity growth rates. This analysis is based on our estimates of
the production technology. Summary and conclusions are offered in Section VI.

In this section, we provide a brief description of total and

factor productivity growth and

the growth of

gross

capital and R&D in the electrical machinery industry for the perIods 1968—73
and 1 971479• We refer to these periods as the pre—OPEC and post—OPEC periods,

respectively.
Average growth rates for gross output and factor inputs for the two
periods are given in Table 1. For the pre—OPEC period the growth rates were
extremely high for Japan in comparison to the U.S. However, in the post-OPEC

period, the Japanese electrical machinery industry experienced a substantial

drop in rates of growth of output and of most inputs.

For example, the

average output growth rate declined from 1 6.9% to 6.4% for Japan while
increasing from 14.2% to Q9% in the U.S.

Still, the level of output growth

rates for the Japanese industry remained high compared to the U.S. industry.
The average growth rate of capital over the period 1968—73 was twice as high

in Japan as in the U.S. even though the U.S. industry experienced a healthy
5.14% per annum growth rate over this period. However, Japan's rate of growth
in capital formation decelerated by more than 140% after 1973. Materials input

grew much faster in Japan than in the U.S. in the pre-OPEC period, but again
Japan experienced a dramatic slowdown in the growth rate of this input during
the second period.
As indicated in Table 1 the R&D stock grew at a much more rapid rate in

Japan than in the U.S. in both periods, reflecting the very high rate of
growth in R&D investment in Japan. In both the U.S. and Japanese electrical
machinery industries the growth in the stock of R&D slowed down in the 19714-79

period.
The growth rate of labor measured in hours worked shows a dramatically

different pattern in the two countries since 1973. It increased from —0.5% in
1968—73 to 1.14% in 19714—79 in the U.S. while in Japan the growth in this input

in this industry is generally lower than in total manufacturing, the opposite
is true for R&D

The R&D

in the electrical machinery

industry are two to three times as large as those in total manufacturing. It
is also important to note that in the U.S. electrical machinery industry the
R&D investment ratios are considerably higher than the capital investment

while the opposite is true in Japan.
Total and partial productivity growth rates based on a gross output
measurement framework are shown in Table 3. Both total arid labor productivity

Thus, the production structure of the electrical machinery industry in
the two countries, characterized by the patterns of factor input substitution
and complementarity

as well as the degree of scale, is qualitatively similar.
Quantitatively there are some differences in scale and in the responses of
inputs to changes In prices and output in the two industries. Both industries
are characterized by increasing returns to scale. However, the Japanese
industry

has a higher scale which substantially influences its

productivity

growth.

estimates of

the restricted cost function using standard duality

For both variable and quasi—fixed factors those output elasticities

exceed long run cost shares because of increasing returns to scale. For the
quasi-fixed factors there is an additional element due to the adjustment

costs. The contribution of each of the variables in (10) is calculated by
multiplying the respective (average) elasticities with the growth rate of the
corresponding variable.
As shown in Table 8 the average growth rate of gross output was very

rapid in Japan in the period 1 968—73 but growth decelerated substantially in
the period 19714—79.

For the U.S., output growth rates were similar In the

two periods. The contributions of various inputs to the growth of output
differ considerably between the two periods and the two industries. The most

significant source of gross output growth is the materials growth,
particularly in Japan. The contribution of' capital is larger in Japan than in
the U.S. but falls in both countries over the post—OPEC period. The R&D stock

contributes

significantly to the growth of output in both

industries. In the

post-OPEC period its contribution falls in the U.S. but remains the same for
Japan. The large contribution of R&D to the output growth may come as a

surprise, but can

by two factors. First, the share

opposite is the case for the U.S.. This reflects the growth pattern of the
labor input in the two industries over the two periods.

presents the decomposition of total factor productivity based on

the U.S. and Japanese electrical machinery. The scale effect is, by far, the
most important contributor to total factor productivity growth. This is
particularly the case in the Japanese industry where the output growth was

very rapid and the estimated degree of' scale is larger than in the U.S.

and about twice as big as in the Japanese electrical machinery industry. The

direct effect of the adjustment costs, 2' is negligible. The combined effect
and

2 due to the adjustment costs is 15 and 14 percent of the measured

total factor productivity for the U.S. and Japan, respectively, and hence not
negligible in particular for the U.S. Consequently, if zero adjustment costs
would have been imposed a nonnegligible portion of measured total factors
productivity would have been misclassified. In addition, inconsistency of the
estimates of the underlying technology parameters would have distorted the
decomposition of total factor productivity.

Conclusion and Summary

structure

and,

the behavior

of productivity growth in the

and Japanese

electrical machinery industry. These industries have
experienced a very high rate of growth of output, are technologically very
progressive (measured by the rate of expenditures on R&D) and are highly
competitive in the domestic U.S. and in the world markets. Our model allows

for

scale effects and the quasi—fixity of some of the input factors. It also

incorporates R&D to capture the high technology feature of the industry.
Other inputs considered are labor, materials and physical capital. We have
also allowed for exogenous technical

change using a time trend. The model was

estimated using annual data from 1960—1980 and 1968—1980 for the U.S. and
Japan, respectively.

The main results of this paper can be summarized as follows:
(i)

The production structure of

countries

the

electrical machinery industry in both

is characterized by increasing

returns to scale; the Japanese

electrical

machinery industry exhibits higher returns to scale than the U.S.
industry. The responses of the factors of production to changes in factor
prices and output in the short, intermediate and long-run are similar.

Materials are found to be generally substitutes for other inputs. Other
inputs are generally complements except for labor and R&D in the U.S.

industry. Capital and

R&D

are found

to

be quasi—fixed and their adjustment

speeds are found to be similar across countries. The stock of capital

adjusts much faster than the stock of R&D.

(ii)

The elements of the so—called Japanese productivity miracle noted by

others are, to a large extent, present in the electrical machinery industry:
High rates of labor productivity growth accompanied by rapid output growth

and

input

growth before 1973

productivity

and

diminishing but still high rates of labor

after 1 973 accompanied by a substantial slowdown in the growth

rates of output and factor inputs.
(iii) Based on the structural estimates of our model, we identify the
following sources of growth of output and labor productivity:
The most important source of output and labor productivity growth is
the growth of materials for both pre-OPEC and post-OPEC periods in both

a)

countries. Technical change and capital were found to be the next most
important factors. For the U.S., capital's contribution exceeds that found

at the total manufacturing level; the reverse is true for Japan.
Consistent with the high ratio of R&D expenditures to gross output in
the electrical machinery industry, we find significant contributions of
b)

R&D to both output and labor productivity growth.
(iv)

The most important source of growth in total factor productivity for

both countries is the scale effect. This is particularly true in Japan due
to the higher scale elasticity and higher rate of growth of output.
Technical change is the second most important contributor. In the context

of our dynamic model the rate of technical substitution for the quasi—fixed
factors deviates in the short—run from the

source also explains part of the traditional measure of total factor

productivity.

—25—

Our model provides a richer framework for the analysis of productivity
growth than some of the conventional approaches by incorporating dynamic

aspects, nonconstant returns to scale, and R&D. The omission of dynamic

aspects will typically result in inconsistent estimates of the technology
parameters and a misallocation in the decomposition of total factors
productivity growth. However, a number of issues remain unresolved:
(i)
Given the rapid expansion of the electrical machinery industries in the

U.S. and Japan, it seems important to explore the effect of nonstatic
expectations on the input behavior and its implications for productivity
growth analysis.

(ii)

It may also be of interest to explore a more general lag structure for

the quasi—fixed factors and to adopt a more general formulation of the model

that allows for scale to vary over the sample period.

(iii) A further area of research is the decomposition of labor into white and
blue

collar workers and

the

modeling of white collar workers as potentially

quasi—fixed. The quasi—f ixity

of

labor may be particularly important in

Japan where employment is considered fairly long-term.
(iv)

Finally, an important extension of the model would be to incorporate

explicitly

the role of

utilisation

demand and thereby analyse the role of the

rate on productivity growth.

were

obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Business Analysis,

Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industrial Economics (BIE). Gross output is

defined as total shipments plus the net change in work in process inventories
and finished goods inventories.
Labor: Total hours worked were derived as the sum of hours worked by
production workers and nonproduction workers. Hours worked by production

workers were obtained directly from the OBA database. Hours worked by
nonproduction workers were calculated as the number of nonproductiori workers *
hours

worked per week * 52. The number of nonproduction workers was obtained

from the OBA database. Weekly hours worked of nonproduction workers were

taken to be 39.7. A series for total compensation in current dollars was
calculated by multiplying the total payroll series from the OBA database with
the ratio of compensation of employees to wages and salaries from U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (1981, 1984).

Materials: Materials in current dollars were obtained from the OBA database.
Materials in constant 1 972 dollars were calculated using deflators provided by

R&D: The stock of total R&D is constructed by the perpetual inventory method

with a depreciation rate 6 .1. The benchmark in 1958 is obtained by
dividing total R&D expenditures by the depreciation rate and the growth rate
in real value added. The nominal R&D expenditures are taken from National
Science Foundation (198)4) and earlier issues. To avoid double counting we
have subtracted the labor and material components of R&D from the labor and

materials inputs. The GDP deflator for total manufacturing is used as a
deflator for R&D.

All constant dollars variables were normalized by respective sample means.
Prices were constructed confonnably.

these series with the corresponding series reported in Economic Planning

For the period 1970—1980 the number of employees

the number of employees was calculated by connecting this series with the
employment index provided by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). Monthly

hours worked for the period 1 977—i 980 were obtained from Statistics Bureau

(1985). For previous years monthly hours worked were calculated by using the
monthly hours work index provided by EPA. For the period 1970-1980 total
compensation is reported in Economic Planning Agency (19814). For the period

before 1970 total compensation was calculated by connecting this series with
an index on cash earnings provided by EPA.

Value Added: For the period 1 970-1 980 data on value added in current and
