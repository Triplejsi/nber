ABSTRACT
Proposition 209 banned the use of racial preferences in admissions at public colleges in California.
We analyze unique data for all applicants and enrollees within the University of California (UC) system
before and after Prop 209. After Prop 209, graduation rates increased by 4.4%. We present evidence
that certain institutions are better at graduating more-prepared students while other institutions are
better at graduating less-prepared students and that these matching effects are particularly important
for the bottom tail of the qualification distribution. We find that Prop 209 led to a more efficient sorting
of minority students, explaining 18% of the graduation rate increase in our preferred specification.
Further, universities appear to have responded to Prop 209 by investing more in their students, explaining
between 23-64% of the graduation rate increase.

Introduction
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to yet again rule on the constitutionality of race-based prefer-

ences (affirmative action) in university admissions in Shuette v. Coalition.1 One of the arguments
opponents of affirmative action have advanced is that affirmative action actually hurts the individuals it is supposed to help – the mismatch hypothesis. According to the mismatch hypothesis,
affirmative action in admissions actually results in worse outcomes for minority students as students admitted under affirmative action are attending schools where the curriculum is designed
for students with significantly stronger credentials.2
In this paper we examine the mismatch hypothesis in the context of college graduation rates.
As documented in Turner (2004), Bound and Turner (2007, 2011), and Bound, Lovenheim and
Turner (2010), while the number of students attending college has increased over the past three
decades in the U.S., college graduation rates (i.e., the fraction of college enrollees that graduate)
and college attainment rates (i.e., the fraction of the population with a college degree) have
hardly changed since 1970 and the time it takes college students to complete a baccalaureate
(BA) degree has increased (Bound, Lovenheim and Turner, 2012). The disparities between the
trends in college attendance and completion or time-to-completion of college degrees is all the
more stark given that the earnings premium for a college degree relative to a high school degree
nearly doubled over this same period (Goldin and Katz, 2008).
We examine differences in graduation rates and the academic preparation of minority and
non-minority students attending the various UC campuses between the years 1995-2000, using
a unique source of student-level data that covers the universe of students who applied to one
or more of the UC campuses. We obtained these data from the University of California Office
of the President, the administrative offices of the entire UC system and refer to them as the
“UCOP” data. The UCOP data cover a period where race-based preferences were banned in
California. In 1996, the voters of California approved Proposition 209 – Prop 209 hereafter –
which stipulates that: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment
to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the
1
This case follows the recent Supreme Court ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas which made clear that
the use of race in college admissions is restricted in remitting the case back to the appellate court.

See the debate over mismatch effects in law schools in Sander (2004, 2005a, 2005b), Ayres and Brooks (2005),

operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” The Proposition took
effect in 1998.
Using these student-level data, we find evidence that the graduation rates of minorities
increased after Prop 209 was implemented. Indeed, the data reveal that under-represented
minorities were 4.4 percentage points more likely to graduate in the period after Prop 209 that
the period before.3 We also find that the distribution of minorities entering the UC system shifted
from its more selective campuses (e.g., UC Berkeley and UCLA) towards its less selective ones.
Moreover, while there was an overall improvement in the academic preparation of minorities
enrolling at UC campuses after Prop 209 went into effect, the greatest improvements occurred at
the less-selective campuses. Taken together, this evidence may be consistent with the mismatch
hypothesis noted above.
As we argue below, the scope for the mismatch of students to campuses with affirmative
action and its alleviation with bans on its use hinges on whether some campuses, presumably
less-selective ones, are better-suited to produce positive outcomes, e.g., graduation rates, for
less-prepared students while other universities, typically more-selective ones, are better-suited
for more-prepared students. In contrast, if more-selective universities were able to produce
better outcomes, such as graduation rates, for students of all levels of preparation than lessselective ones, then there is no scope for student-university mismatch. Bans on affirmative action
would not be expected to improve the graduation rates of minority students, especially those
with weaker backgrounds. We formalize these arguments below, characterizing and estimating
graduation production functions for each of the UC campuses and examining whether and how
they differ across campuses.
The student-level UCOP data we examine also reveal that after Prop 209 there was a decline
in the number of under-represented minorities enrolled at one of the UC campus. And, if the
minority students who did not attend a UC campus after Prop 209 were the least prepared, then
graduation rates would have likely risen, regardless of the campus they would have attended.
That is, Prop 209 may have induced a significant selection effect on minority enrollments within
the UC system that would provide an alternative explanation to mismatch for why minority
graduation rates improved.

Based on five-year graduation rates. We use five-year graduation rates throughout our analysis.

To separate mismatch and selection explanations for the post-Prop 209 minority graduation
rate increases, we exploit the richness of the UCOP data on cohorts of students that entered the
UC system before and after Prop 209. These data contain measures of high school GPAs and
SAT scores and of parental income and education, which allow us to both control for these factors
in evaluating the effects of Prop 209 and assess how they influence minority (and non-minority)
graduation probabilities at the various UC campuses. The UCOP data provide information not
only on which UC campus a student enrolled (as well as whether they graduated from that
campus), but also on the other UC campuses to which they applied and the ones to which they
were admitted. We use the information on the UC campuses to which students were admitted,
and the quality of those UC campuses, to implement a modified version of the method used in
Dale and Krueger (2002) to control for student qualifications beyond those measured by high
school GPA and test scores.
We decompose the post-Prop 209 change in minority graduation rates into three components:
better matching, better students, and a third, residual, category of post-Prop 209 change in
graduation rates not accounted for by the matching or selection. We refer to the latter (residual)
component as the university response to the Prop 209 affirmative action ban.
We find that better matching explains around 18% of the improvement in minority graduation
rates within the UC system. However, this small overall effect masks two notable phenomena
with respect to the potential role of matching. First, we find that matching is much more
important in accounting for the graduation gains of students in the bottom of the academic
preparedness distribution; moreover, it would have been even larger had minorities been allocated
to universities in the same way whites were allocated conditional on academic preparation.
Second, as we discuss in the Conclusion, Arcidiacono, Aucejo and Hotz (2012) find that improved
matching played a much more prominent role in improved graduation rates of minorities who
initially enrolled at UC campuses in STEM (Science, Technology and Engineering) majors,
especially in the higher rates that minorities who started in STEM majors actually graduated
with a STEM degree.
We attribute 23-64% of the minority graduation gains to universities responding by either
investing more in their students or easing requirements. These graduation gains cannot be
explained either by selection or by matching. We present anecdotal evidence that suggest that

3

universities did indeed respond to Prop 209 by focusing more resources on the retention of their
enrolled students, increasing their graduation rates. That such a large share of the gains in
graduation result from responses to UC campuses suggests that potential negative effects on
minorities from the removal of affirmative action may be over-stated in one important respect:
universities may respond to decreased diversity by investing more in the minorities and other
students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do enroll.
Finally, the remaining 18-59% of the minority graduation rate increase is due to changes
in student characteristics, both observed and unobserved, of those enrolled in the UC system
after Prop 209. But the changes in the characteristics of minority enrollees post-209 are not all
in the same direction. While some measures of preparation were higher in the post Prop 209
period (high school grades and SAT scores) other measures actually fell (parental income and
parental education). Hence, the pool of minority enrollees actually became more diverse from a
socioeconomic perspective.4
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the UCOP data
and present the unadjusted levels and post-Prop 209 changes in minority and white student
enrollments, measures of their academic preparation and their graduation rates. In Section 3 we
examine how much of the increased graduation rates for the UC system as a whole remain after
accounting for changes in observables. After showing that a substantial portion of the graduation
gap is unexplained, in Section 4 we characterize the mismatch hypothesis and establish the
conditions it requires in terms of the differences across colleges in their capacity to produce
graduates with disparate academic preparation. In Section 5 we develop and estimate a model of
college graduation that embeds campus-specific graduation production functions that depend on
student preparation using only data in the pre-Prop 209 period. The estimates in Section 5 serve
as one of the inputs of the decomposition of the changes in graduation rates after Proposition 209.
Section 6 decomposes the increased graduation rates following Prop 209, focusing in particular
on the roles of better matching, university responses to Proposition 209, and changes in the
selection of students who enrolled in the UC system. Section 7 concludes.
4

This may be a result of the UC system placing more weight on characteristics correlated with race after Prop
209 since they could not explicitly take race into account. See Antonovics and Backes (2013b) for a discussion.

Graduation Patterns in the UC System Before and After Prop
209
The data we use were obtained from the University of California Office of the President

(UCOP) under a California Public Records Act request. These data contain information on
applicants, enrollees and graduates of the UC system. Due to confidentiality concerns, some
individual-level information was suppressed. In particular, the UCOP data we were provided
have the following limitations:5

1. The data are aggregated into three year intervals from 1992-2006.
2. The data provide no information on gender, and race is aggregated into four categories:
white, Asian, minority, and other
3. Academic data, such as SAT scores and high school grade point average (GPA), were only
provided as categorical variables, rather than the actual scores and GPAs.

Weighed against these limitations is having access to two important pieces of information about
the individuals who applied to and possibly enrolled at a UC campus. First, we have information on every individual who applied to any of the schools in the UC system over the period,
including to which campuses they applied and were admitted. As described below, we use the
latter information to adapt a strategy used in Dale and Krueger (2002) in order to account for
unmeasured student qualifications. Second, we were provided with access to an index of each
student’s preparation for college, given by the sum of a student’s SAT I score, rescaled to be
between 0 to 600, and his or her high school GPA, rescaled to be between 0 to 400. Below, we
refer to this as a student’s high school Academic Index. We have data for the entering cohorts in
the three years prior to the implementation of Prop 209 (1995, 1996, 1997), and for three years
after its passage (1998, 1999, 2000).
In Table 1, we present summary statistics for the individual-level UCOP data and its measures
of student qualifications by race and for applicants, admits, enrollees and graduates for campuses
in the UC system, pre- and post-Prop 209.6 The first panel gives the descriptive statistics
for under-represented minorities (URMs). As a fraction of the number of minority graduates

from California’s public high schools,7 enrollment rates fell from 4.6% to 3.6%. Conditional
on enrolling, minority graduation rates increased by 4.4% off a base rate of 62.4% post-Prop
209.8 While the share of white high school graduates who applied, attended, and graduated in
the UC system all did not significantly change post-Prop 209 (second panel), graduation rates
conditional on enrolling also showed a significant increase at 2.5%.
With respect to applications at UC campuses before and after Prop 209, while applications
by URMs increased, as a share of California public high school graduates, they declined 1.1%.
The latter decline suggests the possibility of a chilling effect of Prop 209, where minorities are
less likely to apply under the new admissions rules. However, other evidence suggests otherwise.
For example, using the same UCOP data as used in this paper, Antonovics and Sander (2013)
argue that affirmative resulted in a warming, rather than a chilling, effect, in that minorities, as a
group, were more likely to enroll in the UC school conditional on being admitted and Antonovics
and Backes (2013a) show that the sending of SAT scores by minority applicants to UC campuses
did not change post-Prop 209.
With respect to academic preparation as measured by the student’s academic index, minorities had much lower scores at each stage of the college process than whites both prior to and
after Prop 209 was implemented (Table 1). This difference in academic preparation accounts, in
part, for the lower proportion of minority high school students being admitted to a UC campus
(“Share of Calif. HS Grads”) compared to whites. However, after Prop 209 is implemented, the
academic preparation of minority applicants, admits, enrollees, and graduates improved, both
absolutely and relative to whites. This improvement in academic preparation of the minority
students that enrolled at a UC campus after Prop 209 suggests that changes in minority student
selectivity with respect to academic preparation noted in the Introduction may have accounted
for some, if not all, of the improved graduation rates of minorities after the implementation of
Prop 209.

The number of California public high school graduates by race and year is given at
http://www.cpec.ca.gov/StudentData/StudentSnapshot.ASP?DataReport=KGrads.
The number of California applicants by race and year can be found at http://statfinder.ucop.edu. While not all of the minorities
applying, enrolling, or graduating from UC campuses are from California’s public high schools, a large fraction
are and we use this benchmark to account for the trends in the numbers of minorities at risk to go to college.
8
Graduation rates are measured as graduating in 5 years or less. There are a small number of individuals that
are listed as graduating but do not have a graduation time. In the period we analyze, these individuals are almost
exclusively listed as having a major classified as ‘Other’. We drop these individuals from our sample though our
qualitative results are unaffected by the treatment of these individuals.

Data Source: UCOP individual data, Pre-Prop 209 (1995-97); Post-Prop 209 (1998-2000).
Variables: No. of Observations is the total number of students who engaged in activity indicated in column heading; No. of Obs./No. of HS Grads is ratio
of a column’s No. of Observations to the number of public high school graduates per year in California; Graduation Rate is share of enrolled students that
graduated in 5 years or less; High School Acad. Index is sum of re-scaled student’s SAT I score (0 to 600 scale) plus re-scaled student’s UC-adjusted high
school GPA (0 to 400 scale); Parents have BA is indicator variable of whether student has at least one parent with Bachelor Degree or more; Parents’ Income
≤ $30K is indicator variable for whether parents’ annual income is ≤ $30,000, where Pre-Prop 209 income are inflation-adjusted to Post-Prop 209 levels;
Parents’ Income ≥ $80K is corresponding variable whether parents’ annual income is ≥ $80,000; and where Graduated denotes those who graduated in 5
years or less.
Totals in each category include occasional cases with missing data; when calculating average sample characteristics, individuals missing that data are dropped.
This includes enrollees with missing graduation information, so Graduation Rate is not identical to graduates/enrollees

But, the change in the selectivity of enrolled minority students with Prop 209 may not have
improved uniformly. As shown in Table 1, there was a significant and sizable decline in the
proportion of minority enrollees and graduates from more “advantaged” family backgrounds
after Prop 209 went into effect. Among admitted minorities who actually enrolled at a UC
campus, there was an 0.039 reduction (a 10% decline) in the proportion with parents who had
a BA degree and a corresponding 0.046 reduction (an 11% decline) among those minorities
that graduated from a UC campus after Prop 209 was implemented. Similarly, post-Prop 209
a greater share of applicants and admits had parents with incomes above $80,000. Yet, the
share of enrollees whose parental income was greater that $80,000 fell. That is, while minorities
from more advantaged family backgrounds continued to apply and be admitted to UC campuses
after Prop 209 (though the set of UC campuses where they were admitted may have changed),
they were less likely to enroll at one of the campuses and less likely to graduate from one of
them.9 This decline in minority students from more advantaged backgrounds that enrolled at UC
campuses after Prop 209 would seem to work against improved graduation rates, given previous
findings that students from wealthier and better educated parents do better in college.10
We next consider how graduation rates and academic preparation varied across UC campuses before and after Prop 209. Table 2 gives the distribution of both for minorities and
whites, respectively. The campuses are listed in order of their overall academic index which
roughly corresponds to their U.S. News & World Report ranking as of the fall of 1997.11 We
use this ranking throughout our study as our measure of the selectivity and/or quality of the
UC campuses. Focusing initially on the pre-Prop 209 tabulations, one sees that the academic
index and graduation rates are systematically related to the rankings of UC campuses, with
more-selective campuses having students that are better prepared and more likely to graduate.
This is true for minorities and for whites. And, consistent with the tabulations in Table 1,
whites have higher academic indices and graduation rates than do minorities, a pattern that
9

We are unable to determine whether, after Prop 209, these more advantaged minorities who applied and were
accepted to a UC campus went to colleges not subject to Prop 209, i.e., private colleges in California or public or
private colleges outside of the state. But we doubt that they disproportionately ended up at less-selective public
colleges in the state, i.e., at CSU campuses or one of California’s community colleges, or not attending college.
10
For example, Turner (2005) finds that students of mothers with a college degree have a 14 percentage point
higher probability of attaining a BA degree than do students whose mothers do not.
11
The 1997 U.S. News & World Report rankings of National Universities are based on 1996-97 data, the academic
year before Prop 209 went into effect. The rankings of the various campuses were: UC Berkeley (27); UCLA
(31); UC San Diego (34); UC Irvine (37); UC Davis (40); UC Santa Barbara (47); UC Santa Cruz (NR); and
UC Riverside (NR). The one exception is that we rank UC Davis ahead of UC Irvine. The academic index is
significantly higher for UC Davis and students who are admitted to both schools and attend one of them are more
likely to choose UC Davis. See Table 4.

holds campus-by-campus.
The changes in student preparedness and graduation rates post-Prop 209 are not ordered
according to the selectivity of the various campuses (Table 2). For example, UC Santa Barbara
had the largest post-Prop 209 improvements in student academic preparedness and graduation
rates, even though it ranked sixth out of the eight UC campuses in the U.S. News & World
Report rankings. Furthermore, UC Berkeley and UC Riverside, which were the top and bottom
ranked UC campuses, were both in the bottom third of post-Prop 209 gains in minority academic
preparedness and graduation rates.
Taken together, the across-campus changes that occur in minority graduation rates and the
academic preparation of those minorities that do enroll is potentially consistent with the view
that the Prop 209 ban of affirmative action resulted in minority students being better matched
to campuses based on their academic preparation. But as noted earlier, this improvement also
may be consistent with greater selectivity in UC minority enrollments post-Prop 209.

Adjusting Graduation Gains for Changes in Observables
In the period after Proposition 209 graduation rates increased for under-represented minori-

ties by 4.4 percentage points and increased for whites by 2.5 percentage points. But characteristics of the entering students changed as well, with both under-represented minorities and
whites coming in with higher academic indexes but lower parental education. Here we examine
how much of the increase in graduation rates can be accounted for after controlling for changes
in observables. We also investigate how the changes in graduation rates differ across different
levels of the academic index.
Letting Git denote whether individual i in time t graduated within five years, we first specify
Git as depending on whether the individual was in the period post-Proposition 209, P OSTit , a
flexible function of observable characteristics Xit , and an error term, it :
Git = α0 P OSTit + f (Xit ) + it

education, income, and initial major, and then add interactions between the academic index and
the other variables. We estimate (1) separately for under-represented minorities and whites.
To assess how the graduation gains vary with a student’s academic index, we interact whether
the individual was in the post-Proposition 209 period with their quartile in the academic index
distribution. We specify the academic index quartiles separately for minorities and whites, using
the pre-Proposition 209 distribution of the academic index for enrollees. Denoting Qit as the
quartile of the academic index distribution for student i at time t, Qit ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, we specify
Git as:
Git = α0 P OSTit +

X

I(Qit = q)αq P OSTit + f (Xit ) + it

(2)

q=1

where the graduation gains are then relative to those in the top quartile.
Results are presented in Table 3. Estimates of (1) show that controlling for the academic
index reduces the overall graduation gains for under-represented minorities and whites by 1.4 and
1.2 percentage points, respectively. These reductions correspond to 32% of the graduation gains
for under-represented minorities and 48% of the graduation gains for whites. Adding additional
controls–parental education, income, and initial major–has little effect on these baseline results,
if anything slightly raising the estimated graduation gains.
Table 3 also shows how the graduation gains vary across the academic index distribution.
For under-represented minorities, the gains are concentrated in the bottom quartiles, with all
specifications showing significantly higher gains for those in the bottom three quartiles relative
to the top quartile. This is consistent with mismatch in that removing affirmative action means
students in the lower quartiles are attending schools that better match their levels of preparation.
In contrast, the gains for whites are fairly uniform across the quartiles of the academic index
distribution. The results for whites suggests the possibility of schools responding to Proposition
209, particularly since Proposition 209 had little to no effect on the share of white students at
each of the campuses, implying matching effects for whites are likely to be small.
The differences in the graduation gains between under-represented minorities and whites
then motivates the possibility that the match between the school and the student is important in
determining graduation outcomes. But the evidence for whites also suggests something happened
with the implementation of Proposition 209 such that graduation rates improved for all levels of

academic preparation. In the next section we develop a model that is flexible enough to capture
these matching effects and return to the possibility of campuses responding to the passage of
Proposition 209 in Section 6.

The Mismatch Hypothesis and University Graduation Production Functions
In this section, we characterize the mismatch hypothesis as it applies to minority graduation

rates. To fix ideas, consider the following characterization of the graduation production function
for one of the UC campuses. Let P r(g = 1|AI, j) denote the graduation rate that campus j
can produce for a minority student with an academic preparation index of AI. For simplicity,

12

assume that this production function is linear and increasing in AI, i.e.,
P r(g = 1|AI, j) = φ0j + φ1j AI

(3)

for UC campus j ∈ {1, ..., J}, where φ1j > 0.
One could proceed by specifying the admission criteria of campuses in the presence and
absence of affirmative action, characterizing the criteria students have for the campuses to which
they apply and to which they enroll if admitted and that campuses use in its admission decisions
and, thus, the matching of students to colleges (or alternative activities).12 For the purposes
of assessing the mismatch hypothesis, it is sufficient to assume that relative to an affirmative
action regime, a college under an affirmative action ban will place less (or no) weight on the
diversity of an incoming student body and more weight on selecting students based on their
academic preparation or AI. The mismatch hypothesis asserts that, under affirmative action,
minority students are more likely to be matched to higher quality colleges for which they are less
well-prepared than their non-minority counterparts. By banning affirmative action, this form of
mismatch of minority students will be reduced, i.e., minority students will be “better matched”
to colleges on the basis of their academic preparation (AI), and the outcomes of minorities, such
as their graduation rates, will improve.13
The validity of this mismatch explanation hinges on whether colleges differ in their graduation
production functions and how they differ between high-quality (more selective) and lower quality
(less selective) colleges. To see this, consider Figure 1, which illustrates two possibilities for the
relationship between the production functions of a more-selective college, Campus A, and a
less-selective one, Campus B. Panel (a) illustrates the case where Campus A has an absolute
advantage over Campus B in producing higher graduation rates for students of all levels of
academic preparation (AI). At the same time, the way Panel (a) is drawn, the higher quality
campus, A, has a comparative advantage at producing higher graduation rates among better
prepared students than Campus B. This latter assumption provides a motivation for why better
prepared students tend to attend higher quality colleges.
For the predictions of the mismatch hypothesis to hold, one requires a stronger set of dif12

See Epple, Romano and Sieg (2008) for such an equilibrium model of college admissions under affirmative
action and when it is banned.

See Dillon and Smith (2009) for reasons why students end up over-matched or under-matched.

ferences between the production functions of higher- and lower-quality campuses. To see this,
consider Panel (b) of Figure 1. As before, Campus A has a comparative advantage in graduating better prepared students. Now, however, Campus A only has an absolute advantage in the
production of graduations for better prepared students, i.e., only for AI > AI. And, Campus
B now has an absolute advantage in the production of graduations for less-prepared students
14

(AI < AI). Now consider what happens to a minority student with academic preparation AI1
who was admitted and attended Campus A under affirmative action but is no longer able to get
into Campus A once affirmative action is banned.14 Because Campus B has an absolute advantage in graduating less prepared students, this student’s likelihood of graduating from college
increases by enrolling in Campus B, as the mismatch hypothesis predicts.15
As the above discussion makes clear, the mismatch hypothesis requires lower-quality (less
selective) universities to have an absolute advantage, and not just a comparative advantage,
in graduating less academically prepared minority students. In the next section, we estimate
campus-specific graduation production functions for each of the UC campuses and assess whether
this condition holds across the UC system’s higher and lower ranked campuses.

5

Estimates of Matching Effects Before Proposition 209
The previous section outlined the flexibility needed in the graduation production function in

order to operationalize the mismatch hypothesis. In this section, we present the basic model we
estimate to gauge the importance of the match between the school and the student to graduation
outcomes. The specification relies only on data before Proposition 209, essentially comparing
graduation outcomes of students from different schools but who had otherwise similar observed
characteristics.
While Section 3 could be criticized for failing to account for post-Proposition 209 minority
enrollees being stronger in unobservable dimensions than pre-Proposition 209 minority enrollees
and hence biasing the estimated effects of Proposition 209 on minority graduation rates upward,
the concern is the opposite when examining match effects using only the pre-Proposition 209
data. Namely, minority students at highly ranked schools are likely stronger on unobserved
dimensions than minority students at lower ranked schools. To address this issue, we take the
14
If students know their academic preparation then they would presumably internalize the fact that their
graduation rates are lower at the more selective campus. However, as discussed in Arcidiacono, Aucejo, Fang, and
Spenner (2011), when schools have private information on the probability of success, it is possible for minority
students to be made worse off under affirmative action.
15
Campus B having a comparative, but not absolute, advantage over A with respect to graduations among
less prepared students, as in Panel (a) of Figure 1, is not enough to generate the implications of the mismatch
hypothesis. To see this, note that if higher quality colleges have an absolute advantage in graduating all students
as in Panel (a), then a less prepared minority student with AI1 (AI1 < AI) that was admitted to Campus A under
affirmative action will experience a lower, rather than higher, graduation rate after affirmative action is banned
and she can no longer attend Campus A.

15

approach used by Dale and Krueger (2002) and add to the baseline specification characteristics
of the schools where minority students submitted applications as well as characteristics of the
schools where minority students were admitted.
As we will show, results from both the baseline specification and from the Dale and Krueger
approach show that the more highly ranked schools have a comparative advantage in graduating
more prepared students. Further, lower ranked schools appear to have an absolute advantage in
graduating students at the bottom of the distribution, suggesting the possibility that one of the
reasons for the increased in graduation rates after Proposition 209 was due to minority students
being better matched.

5.1

Baseline Model

Our baseline model simply extends the model from the previous section to also allow the
probability of graduating to depend on her family background characteristics, Xit , to capture the
influence of financial constraints and preferences and allowing the production function parameters
to vary with the time period (allowing for a university response). Let Gijt denote the 0/1
indicator of whether minority student i who enrolled at UC campus j in cohort t graduated. We
then specify Gijt as:16
Gijt = φ0jt + φ1jt AIit + Xit φ2t + ζit

(4)

where φ0jt and φ1jt are the parameters of the campus-specific production function in (3) and
where ζit is an error term that captures unobserved (to the econometrician) student preferences
and characteristics. Our baseline estimates are found by simply regressing the graduation outcomes of the students on their observed characteristics, allowing the intercept and slope to vary
by the school attended.

5.2

Dale and Kruger Controls

Ideally, a student’s unobserved preferences and characteristics captured by ζit would be
independent from which campus they attended, their AIit and their family background, Xit .
16

We maintain the linear probability model specification in (4) to model graduation rates throughout.

16

If so, the parameters in linear probability model in (4) would be consistently estimated using
standard regression methods. But some of a student’s unobserved characteristics are likely to
correlated with the quality/selectivity of the campus they attend. As has been noted in the
literature,17 failure to control for the full set of factors will likely to result in biased estimates
of the effects of attending more-selective colleges on the outcomes of interest. To help mitigate
this source of selection bias, we implement an approach similar to Dale and Krueger (2002), by
controlling for characteristics of the schools to which the student applied as well as characteristics
of the school to which the student was admitted.
We use various sets of school characteristics to ensure our findings are robust, employing the
following specifications:

• Specification 1 Adds a set of indicator variables for whether the individual applied and
was admitted to each of the eight schools (sixteen indicator variables in all) to the baseline
specification.
• Specification 2 Adds the number of schools where the individual submitted applications
and was admitted in each of the three tiers of UC campuses to Specification 1.
• Specification 3 Adds indicator variables for the highest ranked campus where the individual was admitted to the baseline specification.
• Specification 4 Adds the average academic index of the schools where the individual
submitted applications and was admitted to Specification 2.

(5)

For the Dale and Krueger strategy to be successful in accounting for selection, it must be the
case that students do not always attend the best school to which they were admitted. In Table 4
we look at students who were admitted to different pairs of schools and examine the probability
17

See, for example, Black, Daniel, and Smith (2001), Dale and Krueger (2002), Black and Smith (2004), and
Hoxby (2009).

17

of attending each school in the pair. Conditional on attending one of the schools in the pair, the
entries above the diagonal give the share that attend the school along the row while the entries
below the diagonal give the number of students that were admitted to the pair and attended
one of the two schools. Hence, 1763 minority students were admitted to both UC Berkeley and
UCLA in the pre-Proposition 209 period and chose to attend one of these two schools. Of the
1763, 53.3% chose to attend Berkeley.
With only a few exceptions, the numbers above the diagonal are above fifty percent. This
suggests that our ordering of colleges is reasonable as, conditional on being admitted to both
schools and enrolling in one of them, students are more likely to attend the higher-ranked school.
However, Table 4 also reveals that a non-trivial share of students attend the lower ranked school.
This is particularly true for minorities in the pre-Proposition 209 period where in all cases at
least 10 percent of students chose the lower ranked school conditional on being admitted to both
schools and attending one of the schools in the pair.

5.3

Results

Results are presented in Table 5. The models are estimated so that the academic index is
normalized to have zero mean and a standard deviation of one for minority enrollees in the preProposition 209 period. Both the campus-specific intercepts and slopes are measured relative
to the intercept and slope for UC Riverside. The campus-specific intercepts then reflect the
difference in graduation rates for a minority enrollee at the average AI score, and the slopes are
now normalized to be the percentage point gain in expected graduation resulting from a one
standard deviation increase in the academic index.
The general pattern across the specifications suggest that the more highly-ranked campuses
reward (penalize) students with high (low) academic indexes. Exceptions are UC Davis’ slope
coefficient, which is higher than its rank, and UC Berkeley’s slope coefficient, which is lower than
its rank. With the exception of the baseline specification, the average minority enrollee would
see a higher probability of graduating from any of the four bottom-ranked campuses than at any
of the four top-ranked campuses, between 2 and 6.5 percentage points higher for Specification
4 depending on the campuses. With 60% of minority enrollees at the top four campuses in
the pre-Proposition 209 period, there would appear to be scope for increasing graduation rates

through less aggressive affirmative action policies. While the differences in intercepts are often
not statistically different, the point estimates are large. For example, Specification 4 shows that
the average minority enrollee would be 4.6 percentage points less likely to graduate at UCLA
than at UC Riverside. Highlighting the importance of match effects, if the student was onestandard deviation below the minority mean, the difference would increase to 11.7 percentage
points. But if the student was one-standard deviation above the minority mean, her graduation
probability would be 2.5 percentage points higher at UCLA than at UC Riverside.
To get a sense of the potential importance of match effects, we predict graduation probabilities
at each campus for different percentiles of the minority academic index using Specification 4.18
Table 6 ranks the campuses from highest to lowest predicted graduation probabilities for different
percentiles of the academic index holding fixed the remaining characteristics (family income,
the Dale and Krueger measures, etc.) at the minority sample average.19 The rankings vary
substantially across the academic index distribution. UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside are the
top two campuses for those at the 10th percentile or the 25th percentile of the academic index
distribution yet are the bottom two campuses at the 90th percentile. At the other extreme,
UCLA ranks second to last for the 10th and 25th percentiles yet is the top campus for those at
the 90th percentile.
Table 6 also makes clear that the heterogeneity in graduation rates across universities is
particularly large for those at the bottom of the distribution. The gap between the highest and
lowest graduation rates across schools for students at the 10th percentile of the academic index
was 15.8 percentage points. For students at the 75th percentile of the academic index, the gap
between the highest and lowest graduation rates was a third of the size at 5.2 percentage points.

18

Relative rankings of the campuses in terms of predicted graduation rates are fairly similar across the different
specifications.
19
Those with lower academic indexes are likely worse off on the other characteristics as well but since the
estimated match effects vary only across the academic index, varying these other observed characteristics neither
changes the ranking of the campuses nor does it change the differences in graduation probabilities across campuses
conditional on the percentile of the academic index.

Decomposition of Post-Proposition 209 Graduation Gains
The previous section illustrated that the match between the student and the university is

important for graduation rates. Relatively less-prepared minority students see higher graduation
rates at lower-ranked campuses while the reverse is true for the more-prepared students. Coupled
with the gains in graduation rates post-Proposition 209, this suggests the possibility Proposition
209 improved graduation rates in part due to improving the match between the student and the
school.
But there are at least two other reasons Proposition 209 may have improved graduation
rates. First is selection as affirmative action bans may result in students who had the lowest
probability of graduating no longer being admitted to any school in the system. While Section
3 accounted for selection on observables, minority students in the post-Proposition 209 period
may have also been stronger on unobservables.
It is also possible that affirmative action bans resulted in universities reallocating resources
to ensure that the smaller number of minorities now enrolled would be more likely to graduate.
For example, colleges subject to affirmative action bans may try to improve their tutoring and
counseling programs especially at freshman in order to help them get through their first year of
collegiate studies in order to reduce the rates of drop-out and improve graduation rates.
There is anecdotal evidence that UC campuses did take actions after Prop 209 to improve
student retention rates. For example, UCLA changed the way its introductory courses for first
year students were organized in the wake of Prop 209 in an attempt to improve the retention
of “disadvantaged students.”20 While some of these efforts were direct responses to the passage
of Prop 209, others appear to have been in response to the rising (and continuing) attention
to retaining college enrollees, especially those from disadvantaged groups.21 We note that the
efforts by UC campuses to improve outreach and retention of minority students after Prop 209
could not directly target racial and ethnic groups, which was deemed a violation of ban on the
use of race and ethnicity “in the operation of ... public education” (Text of Proposition 209).22
20

See “Intercollegiate Forums at UCLA discuss Retention of Minorities,” Daily Bruin, March 2, 1998.
See “Scholars urge Early Help for Minorities,” UCLA Today, March 16, 1998.
22
See “Prop. 209 Mandates Changes on Campus,” UCLA Today, October 10, 1997. As noted in Horn and
Flores (2003), some of the post-Prop 209 efforts to improve the retention of minority enrollees at UC Berkeley
were handled by student-run organizations who were not directly subject this provision of Prop 209.
21

23

This led to a restructuring of official campus programs to target disadvantaged, rather than only
minority, students based on “academic profiles, personal backgrounds and social and environmental barriers that may affect [a student’s] university experience, retention and graduation.”23
As a result, some of these retention efforts in response to, or coincident with, Prop 209 may have
affected the graduation rates of both minority and non-minority students.
In this section we seek to separate out the gains in graduation rates after Proposition 209 was
implemented into three components: matching, university response, and selection. We begin by
showing our decomposition strategy and then discuss how Proposition 209 affected the allocation
of minorities across schools. Next, we discuss how to separate out the university response from
selection. Finally, we show the decomposition results.

6.1

Overview

Here we provide an overview of how our decomposition is conducted. Denote the policy
regime as r ∈ {P RE, P OST }. Denote x as the set of observed characteristics that affect graduation probabilities or college assignment. Using Bayes’ rule, we can express the unconditional
probability of a minority student in regime r graduating, P r(g = 1|r), as:
P r(g = 1|r) =

XX
x

P r(g = 1|j, x, r)P r(j|x, r)P r(x|r)

(6)

j

where the inner sum is over the possible colleges and the outer sum is over the possible observed
characteristics. P r(j|x, r) and P r(x|r) then refer to the probability of attending school j given
characteristics x and regime r and the probability of observed characteristics x conditional on
regime r respectively.
The difference in graduation rates across the two periods can then be expressed as:
∆T

= P r(g = 1|P OST ) − P r(g = 1|P RE)
XX
=
P r(g = 1|j, x, P OST )P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P OST )

24

(7)

Equation (7) presents a natural way of considering the three channels through which Proposition
209 changed graduation rates: affecting college assignment (P r(j|x, r)) which in turn affects
matching, affecting the graduation production function directly (P r(g = 1|j, x, r)), and affecting
the distribution of the observed characteristics of minority enrollees (P r(x|r)).24
To isolate how Proposition 209 affected graduation rates through match effects, we use
the graduation production functions and distribution of observed characteristics from the preProposition 209 period and then look at differences in graduation rates to changes in how minorities were allocated across schools:
∆M

=

XX
x

−

P r(g = 1|j, x, P RE)P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P RE)

(8)

j

XX
x

P r(g = 1|j, x, P RE)P r(j|x, P RE)P r(x|P RE)

j

Given the post-Proposition 209 assignment rules, we can examine how changes in university
production functions, which is what we mean by university response, affected graduation rates
using:
∆U R =

XX
x

−

P r(g = 1|j, x, P OST )P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P RE)

(9)

j

XX
x

P r(g = 1|j, x, P RE)P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P RE)

j

Finally, we can examine selection into the sample by examining how the distribution of observed
characteristics changed after Proposition 209.
∆S =

XX
x

−

P r(g = 1|j, x, P OST )P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P OST )

(10)

j

XX
x

P r(g = 1|j, x, P OST )P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P RE)

j

The sum of the three changes then gives the total change in graduation rates.
∆T = ∆M + ∆U R + ∆S
24

(11)

Note that here we are effectively assuming that universities change their graduation production functions
in response to the changes in the assignment rules as the primary effect of Proposition 209 was to change how
minorities were allocated to colleges.

25

In Section 5 we specified and estimated the pre-Proposition 209 graduation production functions, P r(g = 1|j, x, P RE). We can perform a similar exercise to obtain the graduation production functions in the post-Proposition 209 period, P r(g = 1|j, x, P OST ). Note that the Dale and
Krueger adjustments will be substantially different in the post-Proposition 209 period implying
that some care will need to be taken to separate out the university response from selection. The
rest of this section outlines how the remaining components of the decomposition are calculated
as well as performing the decomposition.

6.2

Graduation Gains Due to Matching

We first consider how Proposition 209 affected the allocation of minority students across
the different UC campuses. Letting x denote the regressors used in our baseline specification,
Equation (4), we estimate multinomial logits of the probability of being assigned to each of the
eight schools conditional on having enrolled in one of the schools, allowing the coefficients to
differ across the two regimes.25 The probability of being assigned to school j in regime r given
characteristics x is then:
exp(xαjr )
P r(j|x, r) = P
j exp(xαjr )

(12)

Note that we do not include the Dale and Krueger controls when examining school assignment. Clearly these controls have different interpretations in the two regimes and implicitly
include the dependent variable: if the student did not apply to a particular school or was not
admitted then that student could not be assigned to the school. Estimates of our allocation
mechanism will under-predict unobserved ability at the top schools and over-predict unobserved
ability at the bottom schools. However this will not affect the results of our decomposition
because we have specified unobserved ability to have the same effect on graduation probabilities
at all schools. Indeed, if matching on unobservables is important we are likely to underestimate
the importance of match effects.
Estimates of the minority assignment rules for the two regimes are given in the appendix.
Table 7 gives the predicted probability of pre-Proposition 209 students being assigned to each of
the schools using both the pre and post assignment rules. Assigning pre-Proposition 209 students
25
Here we ignore the fact that some of these students would not be admitted to any of the campuses postProposition 209. The selection into the sample comes in the last part of the decomposition. P r(x|r).

to UC campuses according to the post-Proposition 209 rules shifts minority students out of the
top three schools and into the bottom five, with particularly large shifts to UC Riverside. As
noted above, some of the students assigned to UC Riverside likely would not have been admitted
to any school in the system. It remains an outstanding question whether these students would
then be better matched at lower ranked schools, such as those in the California State system,
and therefore would graduate at an even higher rate or whether schools lower down in the system
produce lower graduation rates that UC Riverside at all levels of academic preparation.
We then predict graduation probabilities using the two different assignment rules to calculate
minority graduation gains from Proposition 209 due to matching. Table 8 gives the results for
each of our five specifications, both overall and for each quartile of the academic index.26 Absent
the Dale and Krueger controls (baseline specification), the gains from matching are positive
but very small. Including the Dale and Krueger controls shows increases the overall minority
graduation rate between 0.64 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points.
These numbers may seem small given the substantial heterogeneity in graduation rates shown
in Table 6. But this is more indicative of the scope for reallocating students. For example,
students at the very bottom of the distribution will be allocated to UC Riverside regardless of
whether we use the pre or post assignment rules. And those at the top of the distribution may
be hurt by shifting to the new rules. The last four rows of Table 8 illustrate the distributional
effects by showing the graduation gains from matching for different quartiles of the academic
26

As before, the quartiles are assigned based on the academic indexes for minority enrollees in the pre-Proposition
209 period.

the next-lowest quartile. These students benefit from being shifted down to schools where they
are more competitive. Smaller, or negative, gains are seen for those in the top two quartiles,
both because these students are better matches for the top schools and because there is less
across-campus heterogeneity in graduation rates for top students.

6.3

Bounding University Response and Selection Effects

Given estimates of the pre-Proposition 209 and post-Proposition 209 production functions,
we would like to predict changes in graduation rates due to changes in the production functions.
The issue is how to adjust the Dale and Krueger effects across the two regimes. We can obtain
the predicted effects from the Dale and Krueger measures under specification k for a student i
in regime r using:
(k)

(k)

P DKir = DKir ψ̂r(k)

(13)

from equation (5). However, we need to be able to map the pre-Proposition 209 effects of the
(k)

Dale and Krueger controls, P DKir , into their post-Proposition 209 counterparts. We do this in
two ways, one of which we believe provides an upper bound on the increase in graduation rates
due to university response, with the other providing a lower bound.
We first assume that the distribution of unobservables is the same both in the pre and post
periods among minority students admitted to any campus, regardless of whether not the student
(k)

enrolled. For those admitted to at least one campus, the nth percentile P DKP RE is matched to

28

(k)

the nth percentile of P DKP OST . Recall that the change in graduation rates due to the university
response is given by:
∆U R =

XX
x

−

P r(g = 1|j, x, P OST )P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P RE)

(14)

j

XX
x

P r(g = 1|j, x, P RE)P r(j|x, P OST )P r(x|P RE)

j

Hence when we calculate the change in university response the x’s we use in P r(g = 1|j, x, P OST )
entail shifting the Dale and Krueger effects in the pre-Proposition 209 to their post-Proposition
209 counterparts by matching percentiles of the Dale and Krueger effects. The remaining graduation gap is then attributed to selection.
The university response as estimated above is likely an upper bound on the university response because minority students who enrolled post-Proposition 209 are likely stronger in unobservable dimensions, captured by our Dale and Krueger controls, than their pre-Proposition
209 counterparts due to more students being rejected from all schools. The share of minority
applicants who are rejected from all UC campuses where they submitted applications rose by
9.2% from the pre-period to the post-period.
To get a lower bound on the university response, we drop the bottom 9.2% of pre-Proposition
209 admits. We then repeat the matching of the pre-Proposition 209 Dale and Krueger effects
to their post-Proposition 209 counterparts by matching percentiles of their distributions.
(k)

But this still leaves the issue of calculating P DKiP OST for the bottom 9.2% of minority
admits in the pre-Proposition 209 period. We assume that, had we observed the values of
(k)

P DKiP OST for those rejected from all schools in the post-Proposition 209 period but who would
have been accepted to at least one school in the pre-Proposition 209 period, the distribution
(k)

of P DKiP OST would be normal, implying what we actually observe is a truncated distribution.
Given the truncated distribution, we can calculate the variance for the full distribution and
(k)

forecast P DKiP OST for those in the left tail.

Decomposition Results

The results for the decomposition for our five specifications are given in Table 9, showing
both the level changes in graduation rates due to each of the three factors (matching, university
response, and selection) as well as the share of the total post-Proposition 209 gain. The first row
gives the matching effects from the first row of Table 8, but now adding the share of the total
graduation gain. The share of the total is very small absent the Dale and Krueger controls, with
the Dale and Krueger controls the share ranges from 14.7% to 27.7% of the total gain.
The next set of rows present our estimates of the upper and lower bounds for the university
response accompanied by the corresponding estimates of the selection component. With the Dale
and Krueger controls, the upper bound on the university response ranges from 2.2 percentage
points to 2.9 percentage points, or between 50% and 67% of the total. The lower bound estimates
range from 1.0 percentage points to 1.5 percentage points, or between 23% and 33% of the total.
Interestingly, these gains, particularly those for the lower bound, line up well with the reducedform gains for whites found in Table 3.

Conclusion
In this paper we have examined how the match between the student and the school affects

college graduation rates. We have found evidence that less-selective UC schools tend to be
better at graduating less-prepared students, with more selective schools better at graduating
more-prepared students. These results are relevant to the debate over the merits of affirmative
action in university admissions to the extent that affirmative action leads to inefficient sorting.
Using data before and after an affirmative action ban, we found evidence that Prop 209 did
lead to a more efficient sorting of minority students within the UC system. However, the effects
were relatively small and we can say little about what happened to those that did not attend
a UC school as a result of Prop 209.27 Given large differences in academic preparation due to
differences in the family backgrounds of students and the quality of the primary and secondary
27

While estimates suggest selective schools see a drop in minority enrollment following affirmative action bans
(Long 2004 and Hinrichs 2012), overall college enrollment rates remain relatively unaffected following a ban (Backes
2012 and Hinrichs 2012).

schools they attended, there is little scope for dramatic shifts in graduation outcomes by resorting of students across campuses.28 That being said, our results indicate that better matching
of students to campuses based on academic preparation does produce the largest graduation rate
gains for those students in the bottom part of the distribution of academic preparation. Further,
while matching effects are small when comparing five-year graduation rates, a companion paper
(Arcidiacono, Aucejo, and Hotz, 2013) shows that mismatch effects are much larger when looking
at persistence in STEM fields and in time to graduation.
Possibly our most intriguing finding is that the imposition of an affirmative action ban may
have induced a response by universities in their efforts to keep students from dropping out and
completing their studies. Previous studies of affirmative action have ignored the potential for
such an institutional response targeted at those minorities that do enroll after a ban and our
results suggest that the magnitude of the potential detrimental effects of affirmative action bans
may be overstated by not taking these responses into account.
More generally, finding ways to improve the college graduation rates of minorities – regardless
of the motivation – would appear to be of growing importance, given the evidence that attending
but not graduating from college has sizeable consequences in one’s later life. Consider, for
example, the disparity in labor market earnings between those who attend but do not graduate
from college and those that do graduate. Based on data from the 2008-2010 waves of the
American Community Survey (ACS), we estimate that the annual earnings of African American
men who completed their BA degree is 47.1% higher than for those who attended but did not
graduate from college. The corresponding differentials are even larger for African American
women (51.1%) and sizeable for both Hispanic men (36.1%) and women (41.1%).29
28

These results are consistent with Arcidiacono and Koedel (2013) who find that most of the black/white
differences in college graduation rates stem from differences in student academic preparation.
29
By way of comparison, the corresponding differentials are 46.5% for white men and 43.0% for white women.

Data Source: UCOP individual data, Pre-Prop 209 (1995-97); Post-Prop 209 (1998-2000).
Variables: No. of Observations is the total number of students who engaged in activity indicated in column heading; No. of Obs./No. of HS Grads
is ratio of a column’s No. of Observations to the number of public high school graduates per year in California; Graduation Rate is share of enrolled
students that graduated in 5 years or less; High School Acad. Index is sum of re-scaled student’s SAT I score (0 to 600 scale) plus re-scaled student’s
UC-adjusted high school GPA (0 to 400 scale); Parents have BA is indicator variable of whether student has at least one parent with Bachelor
Degree or more; Parents’ Income ≤ $30K is indicator variable for whether parents’ annual income is ≤ $30,000, where Pre-Prop 209 income are
inflation-adjusted to Post-Prop 209 levels; Parents’ Income ≥ $80K is corresponding variable whether parents’ annual income is ≥ $80,000; and
where Graduated denotes those who graduated in 5 years or less.
Totals in each category include occasional cases with missing data; when calculating average sample characteristics, individuals missing that data
are dropped. This includes enrollees with missing graduation information, so Graduation Rate is not identical to graduates/enrollees

Campus-specific intercepts are evaluated at mean academic index for pre-209 Minority
students and are measured relative to UC-Riverside.
Campus-specific slope coefficients on standardized academic index variable, AIstd,r,t for
r = M inority and t = P re − 209. Each coefficient measures the effect of a one S.D.
increase in academic index on probability of graduation and these effects are measured
relative of that for UC-Riverside.
All specifications include the following control variables: parents’ income and education
and initial major.
Specification 1 adds a full set of dummy variables indicating whether the student applied
to and/or admitted to each of the eight UC campuses.
Specification 2 adds to Specification 1 the number of campuses applied to and admitted
to for each of three tiers of UC campuses, with Tier 1 which includes UC-Berkeley,
UCLA and UC-San Diego, Tier 2 which includes UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Santa
Barbara, and Tier 3 which includes UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside, and also dummy
variables that indicate whether a student applied to campuses in the Tier above or in
the Tier below the Tier to which they were admitted.
Specification 3 includes the base specification plus a set of dummies for the highest
ranked campus a student was admitted to.
Specification 4 includes the controls in Specification 2, plus a student’s total number
of applications and admissions, respectively, as well as an average of average academic
index of the applicants/admits for campuses the student applied/was admitted.
