On the Asset Market View of Exchange Rates

ABSTRACT
If the asset market is complete then the difference between foreign and domestic agents' log
intertemporal marginal rates of substitution (IMRSs) equals the log change in the real exchange
rate. This equation is frequently used to argue that changes in real exchange rates reflect
differences between agents' required compensation for exposure to asset return uncertainty. We
show that the relative returns on frictionlessly traded assets are only reflected in the common
component of agents' IMRSs, not differences. Instead, when this equation does offer insights,
frictions in the goods market are the source of economic distinction between agents.

Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) refer to Eq. (1) as the asset market view of exchange rates.

1

It is now a dominant theoretical framework in the recent international asset

pricing literature and has been used to understand exchange rate determination, foreign ex-

2

change risk premia, and international risk sharing.

For a recent survey of this literature,

see Lustig and Verdelhan (2012).
We oer a critique of this framework.

The dierence between agents' log IMRSs is

often interpreted as the dierence between their required compensation for exposure to the
uncertainty in asset returns. However, this economic interpretation does not account for any
dierence in units over which agents' IMRSs are expressed. When Eq. (1) holds, we show
that the foreign and domestic agents actually require the same, not dierent, compensation
for exposure to asset return uncertainty.
Therefore, structural assumptions about preferences and goods market frictions are necessary to interpret variation in real exchange rates as dierences between agents' IMRSs. For
example, suppose that the asset market is complete and agents in dierent economies have
the same consumption aggregators over individual goods. With these assumptions, frictions
in the goods market are the only source of economic distinction between agents, and the
amount of variation in the real exchange rate reects the degree to which this risk in the
goods market is not shared across these economies. However, there is an important observational equivalence problem. We show that the same real exchange rate behavior can result
if the asset market is complete and goods markets are frictionless, but agents have dierent
preferences over individual goods.

In this case, agents share risk perfectly.

Thus, armed

1 In a distinct earlier literature, the asset market view of exchange rates referred to the role of asset
markets and capital mobility in exchange rate determination. This literature emphasized the importance of
the fact that nominal exchange rates and asset markets adjust much more quickly than goods markets. See,
for example, Dornbusch (1976), Frenkel (1976), Kouri (1976), and Mussa (1976).

2 Examples of papers where this approach appears include: Bansal (1997); Backus, Foresi, and Telmer

(2001); Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002); Smith and Wickens (2002); Ahn (2004); Brandt, Cochrane, and
Santa-Clara (2006); Lustig and Verdelhan (2006); Brennan and Xia (2006); Lustig and Verdelhan (2007);
Bakshi, Carr, and Wu (2008); Verdelhan (2010); Colacito and Croce (2011); Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011); Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013); and Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014).

only with asset returns, exchange rates, and aggregate consumption data, it is impossible to
dierentiate between models in which agents share risk perfectly and ones where they don't.
Although our paper is a critique, a positive message from it is that structural modeling is
helpful if it is specic about goods markets and preferences over disaggregated consumption,
and brings relevant evidence to bear.

1 The Asset Market View of Exchange Rates
To facilitate comparisons across economies, consider a frictionlessly traded basket of assets
and/or goods and services that serves as a common numeraire. In the domestic economy, let

Pd,t

be the number of units of this numeraire that can be traded for one unit of the domestic

representative agent's consumption basket of goods and services at time

t.

Likewise, let

Pf,t

be the number of numeraire units that can be traded for one unit of the foreign agent's
consumption basket at time

t

in the foreign economy.

The real domestic/foreign exchange rate,

et = Pf,t /Pd,t , is the price of a unit of the foreign

agent's consumption basket, expressed in units of the domestic agent's consumption basket.
Any frictionlessly traded numeraire yields the same real exchange rate. Let
change in the real exchange rate from time

Xt = et /et‚àí1 = Œ¥d,t /Œ¥f,t ,

where

t‚àí1

to

t.

Xt

be the gross

Then,

Œ¥d,t = Pd,t‚àí1 /Pd,t

and

Œ¥f,t = Pf,t‚àí1 /Pf,t .

(2)

The real exchange rate is constant if the composition of agents' consumption baskets is
identical, and they face the same prices for all goods and services (i.e., purchasing power
parity holds across these economies). Therefore, the real exchange rate only varies over time
if at least one of these conditions is violated.
Consider an arbitrage-free set of

k

assets that can be frictionlessly traded across these

Œ∑
economies. Let Rt denote the vector of gross returns on these assets, from time

t‚àí1

to

t,

denominated in units of our numeraire. Then the gross asset returns, denominated in units
of the domestic and foreign agents' consumption baskets, are given by

Rt = Œ¥d,t RŒ∑t

and

R‚àót = Œ¥f,t RŒ∑t ,

(3)

respectively.
For concreteness (and without loss of generality), a portfolio of the assets themselves can
serve as our common numeraire, so long as its gross return is almost surely strictly positive.

2

Let

Œ∑

be a vector of portfolio weights for such a numeraire, in which case

gross asset returns relative to the gross return on this portfolio. Then

RŒ∑t

Œ¥d,t

is the vector of

and

Œ¥f,t

equal the

gross return on this numeraire portfolio, denominated in units of the domestic and foreign
consumption baskets, respectively. That is,

Rt ¬∑ Œ∑ = Œ¥d,t ,

R‚àót ¬∑ Œ∑ = Œ¥f,t ,

and

Rt

and

expressed over units

‚àó
of her consumption basket of goods and services. Likewise, let Mf,t be the foreign agent's
IMRS over units of his consumption basket during this period. Since the agents can trade
the assets, their IMRSs must satisfy the well-known rst order (Euler) conditions

 ‚àó ‚àó

and

Œ∑
‚àó
Mf,t
= Mf,t

The change of numeraire units in Eqs. (3) and (6) preserves agents' pricing of asset return
uncertainty, characterized by Eq. (5), since

Therefore, the log dierence between agents' required compensation for exposure to asset
return uncertainty is captured by

Œ∑
Œ∑
‚àó
= ln Mf,t
‚àí ln Md,t ‚àí ln Xt .
ln Mf,t
‚àí ln Md,t

(8)

Importantly, this dierence does not depend on the particular choice of frictionlessly traded
numeraire that is used as a common basis for comparison across agents, since any such

3

numeraire yields the same real exchange rate.
According to the asset market view, when Eq. (1) holds, the change in the real exchange
rate reects the dierence between the foreign and domestic agents' required compensation
for exposure to asset return uncertainty. However, Eq. (1) holds when

Œ∑
Œ∑
Md,t
= Mf,t

in Eq. (8),

so these agents actually require the same, not dierent, compensation for exposure to the
uncertainty in asset returns. Instead, the change in the real exchange rate simply reects the
dierence in units  dierent consumption baskets of goods and services, and/or dierent
prices for the components of those baskets  over which agents' IMRSs (and the asset returns)
are expressed. This point is our main critique of the asset market view of exchange rates.
Thus, to draw conclusions from Eq. (1) about meaningful economic distinctions between
agents, we must make further assumptions about the underlying economic environment
beyond the asset market structure. In particular, as we show in Section 4, exchange rate
data, together with Eq. (1), can be used to draw important distinctions between domestic
and foreign agents if we further assume that they have the same consumption aggregators
over individual goods and there are goods market frictions.

However, regardless of any

additional assumptions about goods markets, it still remains that the foreign and domestic
agents' require the same compensation for exposure to asset return uncertainty whenever
Eq. (1) holds.

1.1 Stochastic Discount Factors (SDFs)
Eq. (1) also characterizes a change of units for a stochastic discount factor (SDF). An SDF
for

Rt

is dened as an almost surely strictly positive random variable,

Mt > 0,

such that

1 = E [Mt Rt ] .

(9)

are examples of SDFs for Rt and Rt , respectively. From Eq. (7),

Œ¥f,t are both examples of SDFs for RŒ∑t .

‚àó
Eq. (1) holds if and only if Md,t = Mf,t , in which case Md,t and Mf,t are the same SDF,
From Eq. (5),

Md,t

and

simply denominated in dierent units. That is, dropping the subscripts on agents' IMRSs,

Mt

is an SDF for

Rt = Xt R‚àót

if and only

Mt‚àó = Mt Xt

is an SDF for

R‚àót ,

and vice versa.

1.2 Illustrative Example: Complete Asset Markets
Before closing out this section, we demonstrate how our critique applies to the special case
of complete asset markets, which is the canonical example upon which the asset market view

4

of exchange rates is based.
A set of asset returns is a complete market for an agent if: (i) there are no events over
which the agent's IMRS varies, but the asset returns do not; and (ii) there is a unique SDF
within the space of SDFs that can be expressed as a function of those asset returns (or,
more precisely, there is a unique SDF within the space of SDFs that are measurable with
respect to the

œÉ -algebra

generated by those asset returns).

Thus, if the asset returns are

a complete market for both the foreign and domestic agents, then their IMRSs are equal
(when expressed over a common numeraire that is frictionlessly traded) and Eq. (1) holds.
If the asset market is complete then we can explicitly characterize the agents' IMRSs.
Long (1990) shows that an SDF for

MtŒ∑ = (RŒ∑t ¬∑ Œ∏ ? )‚àí1 ,

where

RŒ∑t

is given by



Œ∏ ? = arg max E [ln (RŒ∑t ¬∑ Œ∏)] ‚áí E (RŒ∑t ¬∑ Œ∏ ? )‚àí1 RŒ∑t = 1 .
Œ∏¬∑1=1

(10)

Karatzas and Kardaras (2007) prove that this SDF always exists (whenever there is an SDF
that satises Eq. 9). Therefore, if the asset market is complete for the foreign and domestic
agents, then

MtŒ∑

in Eq. (10) is the unique SDF for

RŒ∑t ,

and their log IMRSs must equal

ln Md,t

and

‚àí ln(R‚àót ¬∑Œ∏ ? )

(11)

‚àí ln(Rt ¬∑Œ∏ ? )

Recall that, according to the asset market view of exchange rates, the dierence between
agents' log IMRSs is economically interpreted as the dierence between their required compensation for exposure to asset return uncertainty. However, this required compensation is

ln MtŒ∑ = ‚àí ln (RŒ∑t ¬∑ Œ∏ ? ),

which is common to both agents' log IMRSs. Instead,

any dierence between their IMRSs,

ln Œ¥d,t ‚àí ln Œ¥f,t = ln Xt , simply reects the dierent units

captured by

over which their IMRSs (and the asset returns) are expressed.

2 Economic Interpretation of SDFs in Ane Models
In this section we demonstrate how our critique applies to the large literature that uses
reduced-form ane models of two (or more) log SDFs to characterize and economically
interpret currency returns as dierences between agents' IMRSs.

3 A few examples of papers that pursue this modeling approach include: Backus, Foresi, and Telmer
(2001); Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002); Bakshi, Carr, and Wu (2008); Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan
(2011); and Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014).

In the literature we critique, the reduced-form SDFs in Eq. (12) are often assumed to equal
the IMRSs of representative agents in the domestic and foreign economies.

Œª is economically

interpreted as the compensation that agents in the domestic economy require for exposure
to the vector of asset return shocks,

Œµt .

Likewise, the

ith

row of

Œõ‚àó

is interpreted as the

prices of risk that agents in the ith foreign economy assign to these shocks. According to this
economic interpretation of Eqs. (12) and (13), both the volatility and expected excess return
on foreign currency investments reect heterogeneity across agents in dierent economies in
the compensation they require for exposure to these asset market shocks.

2.1 Example: Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014)
Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014) is a recent and representative example in the
literature that we critique.

They document that currency returns can be explained by a

small set of currency factors (i.e., dynamic long/short portfolios of currencies). To interpret
these empirical results, they provide a reduced-form ane model of agents' IMRSs that is
driven by a vector of

Then

Rit = Œ¥f,t RŒ∑t

are these asset returns, denominated in the

consumption units of the ith foreign economy, where

Œ¥i,t = Pi,t /Pi,t‚àí1 , and Pi,t

is the number

of numeraire units that can be traded for one unit of the representative agent's consumption

4 For example, Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014, p. 537) state that Accounting for the variation
in expected currency excess returns across dierent currencies requires variation in the SDFs' exposures to
the common innovation. ... Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2011) show that permanent heterogeneity
in loadings ...

is necessary to explain the variation in unconditional expected returns (why high interest

rate currencies tend not to depreciate on average), whereas the transitory heterogeneity in loadings ... is
necessary to match the variation in conditional expected returns (why currencies with currently high interest
rates tend to appreciate).

Rt = Œ¥d,t RŒ∑t = Xti Rit

are these asset

returns, denominated in domestic consumption units.
For tractability, given the ane log SDFs in Eq. (12), the vector of log returns on these
assets are typically assumed to also be ane functions of the latent shocks,

Œµt .

If these log

asset returns span this vector of shocks, then we can invert this relationship and express
the shocks as ane functions of the log asset returns. Substituting this inversion back into
Eq. (12), the log SDFs can be expressed as ane functions of the log returns,

ln Mt = c ‚àí Œ• ¬∑ ln Rt
for some

c, ci , Œ•,

and

ln Mti = ci ‚àí Œ•i ¬∑ ln Rit ,

and

Œ•i .

The change of units,

‚àÄi ‚àà {1, . . . , ` ‚àí 1} ,

ln Xti = ln Mti ‚àí ln Mt ,

2.3 Implications of No-Arbitrage
The dynamics of short-term interest rates can also be included in models of the form in
Eq. (12), in which case the model will have no-arbitrage implications for the term structure
of interest rates in the domestic and foreign economies. However, Eq. (12) does not impose
any such overidentifying restrictions.
A particularly well-known paper in this literature is Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001)
who characterize the (forward premium) anomaly in the context of ane models of the
term structure of interest rates.

5

The restrictions they derive are not actually due to

5 In contrast to much of the literature, Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001) are careful not to interpret the
SDFs in their model as the IMRSs of domestic and foreign representative agents.

9

Eqs. (12) and (13), but instead reect an implicit spanning assumption. The intuition can
be understood as follows. Any dynamic no-arbitrage model of the term structure of interest
rates in two economies must have at least four assets: short- and long-term bonds in both
economies. With four assets, there are three relative returns to consider. However, Backus,
Foresi, and Telmer (2001) assume that those three relative returns are driven by only two
shocks, in which case one (or a portfolio) of the three assets must be redundant, since it
can be replicated by a combination of the other two. It is this redundancy, not the forward
premium anomaly or Eqs. (12) and (13), that is the source of the restrictions they derive.
It is also important to recognize that Eq. (1) does not imply that a foreign currency return
is a redundant asset that can be replicated by a combination of other assets. For example,
Ahn (2004) provides a model in which shocks to real exchange rates are not completely
spanned by the shocks that drive bond returns denominated in local units. The model in
Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2014) also has this feature.

6

3 Restrictions in Reduced-Form Models
Beyond the economic interpretation of SDFs, some papers in the literature we critique suggest
that the change of units in Eq. (1) also imposes restrictions on reduced-form models of
currency returns. It does not. In this section we show that the restrictions in these papers
are actually errors.

3.1 SDFs for Dierent Sets of Assets
Brennan and Xia (2006) test whether the change of units,
SDFs,

ln X t = ln M ‚àót ‚àí 1 ln Mt , holds for

Mt and M ‚àót , that they estimate to only price domestic and foreign bonds, respectively.

However, this test is not motivated by theory, since the change of units only applies to SDFs
that price the same set of assets. To demonstrate this point with a simple counterexample,
note that

ln Mt = ‚àírt‚àí1

and

ln M ‚àót = ‚àír ‚àót‚àí1

are log SDFs that only price domestic and

foreign one-period default-free bank account returns denominated in local units. However,
if the exchange rate is not determined prior to time

t

(i.e., it is stochastic), then

true in general if markets are incomplete (which is the relevant case required to prove their desired result).

9 See Eq. (24) in Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002, p. 176). They state that the key insight of our model

is that when markets are incomplete, the volatility of the exchange rate is not uniquely determined by the
domestic and foreign stochastic discount factors. ... If markets are incomplete, the volatility of the exchange
rate can contain an element that is orthogonal to the priced sources of risk in both countries. ... To capture
this excess volatility, we specify a stochastic process for the degree of market incompleteness.

3.4 Market Completeness in Reduced-Form Models
In reduced-form models of asset returns, there is a unique SDF (or, equivalently, a unique
pricing measure) if and only if any contingent claim on the assets can be exactly replicated by
a (dynamic) portfolio of the assets.

11

Since reduced-form models focus exclusively on asset

returns, the SDFs in these models can only be unique within the space of SDFs that are
measurable with respect to the

œÉ -algebra generated by these returns.

The binomial tree and

Black-Scholes-Merton models are perhaps the best known examples of reduced-form models

12

with SDFs that are unique in this sense.

While the unique SDFs in these reduced-form models are useful for pricing and hedging
contingent claims (e.g., options), they do not necessarily equal the IMRS of a representative
agent in Eq. (1). For example, when there is a unique reduced-form SDF for the asset returns
denominated in domestic consumption units, it can be expressed as

ln Mt = ‚àí ln (Rt ¬∑ Œ∏ ? ).

Md,t = Œ∂t Mt , where Œ∂t is a random variable
that is independent of Rt with E [Œ∂t ] = 1. In this case, Md,t is an SDF for Rt , but the agent's
IMRS varies over states of the world, captured by Œ∂t , that the asset returns do not (i.e., Md,t
is not measurable with respect to the œÉ -algebra generated by Rt ).

However, the domestic agent's IMRS could be

Thus, an SDF in a reduced-form model can only be economically interpreted as the IMRS
of a representative agent under the additional assumption that there are no events (i.e., states
of the world) over which the agent's IMRS varies, but the asset returns in the model do not.
This additional assumption is common in more structural models (with agents) because it
makes them much easier to solve. However, it is not a common assumption in reduced-form

10 Similarly, Anderson, Hammond, and Ramezani (2010) show that, in the special case of an ane setting,
the assumptions in Brandt and Santa-Clara (2002) are infeasible.

Eq. (29) illustrates that the internal

inconsistency (i.e., the arbitrage opportunity) applies more generally, beyond the specic ane structure.

11 See the seminal work by Harrison and Kreps (1979) and Harrison and Pliska (1981, 1983).
12 For details on the binomial tree model, see Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979). For the Black-Scholes-

Merton model, see Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973). The discrete-time (continuous state space)
model in Eqs. (12) and (13) is an example of a reduced-form model that does not have a unique SDF; for
example, Long's SDF in Eq. (10) is another, dierent SDF that is also consistent with the asset return
dynamics. However, the continuous-time limit of Eq. (12) is a continuous diusion and in that case,
Eq. (18) is equal to

in Eq. (10).

in

models (outside of the international asset pricing literature).

In fact, the primary appeal

of reduced-form models is that one is free to model the relative returns on a subset of the
assets available to trade, and can be agnostic about any variation in agents' IMRSs that is
independent of the returns on those (or any other) assets.

4 Models with Agents and Risk Sharing
We now turn to a discussion of models in which there are two agents, who reside, respectively,
in the domestic and foreign economies. In Section 4.1 we highlight the model elements that
are particularly relevant for our subsequent discussion. In Section 4.2 we characterize the
conditions under which variation in the real exchange rate directly reects imperfect risk
sharing. In Section 4.3 we show that asset returns can be informative about the amount of
risk shared between agents, but not about the amount of unshared risk. Finally, in Section
4.4, we work with a simple model motivated by Backus and Smith (1993), to show that
fundamentally dierent models of real exchange rates can be observationally equivalent at
the level of aggregate consumption data.

4.1 Model Highlights
We describe an economy with two countries (domestic and foreign), each with a representative agent. Utility is dened over

j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
and indexed by

n

individual consumption goods, which are indexed by

All goods are perishable and both agents are price takers. Time is discrete,

t,

but we suppress date subscripts unless strictly necessary.

The domestic agent has an instantaneous level of utility

where

cjd

is her consumption of good

where

For convenience we assume that the utility functions

over the aggregate are the same, but that the consumption aggregators,

and

cf

may be

dierent.
Both economies are cashless and use good 1 as the numeraire, which is assumed to be
frictionlessly traded.

Our model would have the same implications for the real exchange

rate if we chose dierent numeraires. Goods markets meet sequentially. Goods may or may
not be frictionlessly traded, so prices for those goods may dier across the economies. Price
dierences might be the result of physical trading costs (in the extreme, some goods might be
nontraded) or might stem from price discrimination by producers. The domestic and foreign
prices of good

j

are, respectively,

Pdj

Pfj .

and

For any good that is frictionlessly traded, its

price must be the same in both countries:

Pdj = Pfj .

Colacito and Croce (2011, p. 156) also adopt this denition of perfect risk sharing, which
states that the domestic and foreign agents equate IMRSs over all individual goods and
services at every point in time. It is not equivalent to asset markets being complete, which
would only imply that

Œût = 1

for all

t.

Nor is it equivalent to an allocation that coincides

with the solution to a social planner's problem that respects goods market frictions. In either
of these situations, risk sharing will be as good as it can be, but any market frictions that
result in a wedge between

prevent IMRSs over some goods being

basket. We use an asterisk to denote the foreign agent's IMRS because the foreign agent
may have dierent preferences over individual goods than the domestic agent. This would
imply that the two IMRSs are expressed in dierent units. Given that the agents' baskets
are homogeneous of degree one aggregates of their consumption of individual goods, the
prices of these baskets (in some common numeraire) may be written as homogenous of
degree one functions of the individual prices (in the same numeraire) faced by these agents:

Pd = Hd (Pd1 , Pd2 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ) and Pf = Hf (Pf1 , Pf2 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ), with the functional forms of Hd (¬∑) and Hf (¬∑)
being related to the functions cd (¬∑) and cf (¬∑) (see Varian, 1984). The subscripts on these
functions allow for the possibility that the agents' preferences dier. At the level of aggregate
consumption the equation that corresponds to Eq. (33) is

necessarily implies that either markets for some goods are not frictionless or agents have
dierent consumption aggregators (or both).
Does a variable real exchange rate, by itself, directly reect imperfect risk sharing?
Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) argue very strongly that the answer is always yes.
Table 1 summarizes our answer to this question, and as the table indicates, it depends on
underlying assumptions about the economic environment. The answer is yes if we assume
that asset markets are complete, and that agents have identical consumption aggregators.
With these assumptions,

Œût = 1

and variation in

(due to variation in the real exchange

et ) can only happen if there are goods market frictions that drive wedges between

implies imperfect risk sharing.
Under any of the other combinations of assumptions shown in Table 1, however, the
answer is no. For example, in the northeast corner of the table, asset markets are assumed
to be complete, but preferences over goods dier (Hd

6= Hf ).

To summarize, there is no direct connection between risk sharing and real exchange rate
variation except in models where asset markets are complete and agents have identical consumption aggregators. In that case, goods market frictions are the only source of dierence
between agents' IMRSs.

4.3 Asset Prices and Unshared Risks
In contrast to our discussion in the previous section, Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara
(2006) argue very strongly that real exchange rate variation is always informative about
risk sharing. In fact, they conclude that because real exchange rate variation is small compared to Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bounds on the volatility of domestic and foreign
SDFs, domestic and foreign marginal utility growths must be highly correlated, and risk
sharing must be better than you think. On page 673, Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara
(2006) emphasize that their conclusion is drawn by only using data on asset returns and real
exchange rates:
Yet the conclusion is hard to escape. Our calculation uses only price data, and
no quantity data or economic modeling (utility functions, income or productivity
shock processes, and so forth). A large degree of international risk sharing is an
inescapable logical conclusion of Eq. (1), a reasonably high equity premium (over
1%, as we show below), and the basic economic proposition that price ratios
measure marginal rates of substitution.
To understand why Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006) draw this dierent conclusion,
consider a version of their quantitative risk sharing index, applied to the logarithms of the

‚àó
IMRSs in our structural model (mf,t
‚àó

var(m‚àóf,t ) + var(md,t )

Given our discussion in Section 4.2, it is clear that to base a risk sharing measure on

(35)

RSI,

one must assume that preferences across goods are identical across locations. In other words,

13 The index is the same as the correlation between

This issue brings us back to a problem we

highlighted in the section on reduced form models. These models are silent about dierences
between agents. Consistent with our main message in Sections 13, asset returns, alone, can
provide useful information about how much risk is shared (via Hansen-Jagannathan bounds),
but any measure of the degree of risk sharing also requires a measure of the amount of
unshared risk. Likewise, any measure of the correlation between agents' IMRSs also requires
a measure of

Œæt .

Of course, one is always free to introspect, as Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-

Clara (2006) do in Sec. 3.5 of their paper, on how much unshared risk seems reasonable.
Our view is that this introspection is merely speculative if additional data and theory are not
brought into the picture. Additionally, this introspection is not informed by exchange rates
and applies equally well to agents living in the same economy, who face the same prices.

In this section, we use a more specic model to highlight the fact that fundamentally dierent
models of real exchange rates can be observationally equivalent at the level of aggregate
consumption data. The model is similar to the one in Backus and Smith (1993), in being
an endowment economy, with two agents, two periods, and two goods. As above, we allow
preferences across individual goods to vary across agents in the two economies. The utility

u, is logarithmic in the consumption aggregate, while the consumption aggregators
cd (c1d , c2d ) = (c1d )Œ∏d (c2d )1‚àíŒ∏d and cf (c1f , c2f ) = (c1f )Œ∏f (c2f )1‚àíŒ∏f . Given these assumptions, it is

function,
are

straightforward to solve for the dynamics of the real exchange rate for a number of dierent
variants of the model, as shown in the Online Appendix.
When assets markets are complete, representative agents in the two economies have
dierent preferences over two individual goods, and trade in goods is frictionless, we have

ln (cd,t /cd,t‚àí1 ) = Œ∏d ln G1t + (1 ‚àí Œ∏d ) ln G2t ,

and

(38a)

ln (cf,t /cf,t‚àí1 ) = Œ∏f ln G1t + (1 ‚àí Œ∏f ) ln G2t .

(38b)

G1t and G2t are, respectively, the gross growth rates of the global endowments of goods
1 and 2. Models of this type, which emphasize the role of dierent preferences over individual

Here,

goods, have been important workhorses in the modern exchange rate literature.

16

Consider an alternative model, in which assets markets are complete, representative

Howard (2018).

,
ln (cÃÉd,t /cÃÉd,t‚àí1 ) = Œ∏ ln GÃÉ1t + (1 ‚àí Œ∏) ln gÃÉdt

and

(39a)

ln (cÃÉf,t /cÃÉf,t‚àí1 ) = Œ∏ ln GÃÉ1t + (1 ‚àí Œ∏) ln gÃÉf2t .

in the modern exchange rate literature.

17

The two models are observationally equivalent for the real exchange rate when they are
observationally equivalent with respect to aggregate consumption. As an example, we can
specify the stochastic processes for the endowments so that

GÃÉ1t = G1t ,


2
ln gÃÉd,t
= (Œ∏d ‚àí Œ∏) ln G1t + (1 ‚àí Œ∏d ) ln G2t / (1 ‚àí Œ∏) ,


2
ln gÃÉf,t
= (Œ∏f ‚àí Œ∏) ln G1t + (1 ‚àí Œ∏f ) ln G2t / (1 ‚àí Œ∏) .

(40a)
and

(40b)
(40c)

With these assumptions, the two models have the same consumption growth rates and real
exchange rate:

ln Xt = ln (cd,t /cd,t‚àí1 ) ‚àí ln (cf,t /cf,t‚àí1 ) ,


2
2
= (Œ∏d ‚àí Œ∏f ) ln G1t ‚àí ln G2t = (1 ‚àí Œ∏) ln gÃÉd,t
‚àí ln gÃÉf,t
.

(41)

The implication of this example is that an econometrician would not be able to discern which
mechanism is more relevant without looking at consumption and endowments at the level
of individual goods.

The two models are also very dierent in terms of risk sharing.

In

one model, risk is shared perfectly, and only global endowments matter. When the global
endowment of good

rises faster than that of good

and the foreign agent puts more

its relative abundance means the real exchange rate falls.

18

In the other

17 See, for example, for example, Backus and Smith (1993), Tesar (1993), Stockman and Tesar (1995) or
Ready, Roussanov, and Ward (2017).

18 In fact, this model is equivalent to a model of a single representative agent whose preference weight is a

weighted average of

Œ∏d

and

Œ∏f .

The equilibrium price of good

is identical. The real exchange rate can be

model, risk sharing is imperfect when the endowment growth rates for good

grows faster, this makes his basket

relatively abundant, and the real exchange rate falls.
It should also be clear, of course, that if one were to estimate these structural models
using only the pricing equations expressed in terms of consumption aggregates, it would be
impossible to distinguish between model variants in which (i) asset markets are complete
or incomplete, (ii) agents have the same or dierent preferences over individual goods, and
(iii) trade in goods is frictionless or not. A direct test of the model based on Eq. (34), √† la
Backus and Smith (1993) would face the same problem.
This is not to say that it is impossible to distinguish between models with imperfect
or perfect risk sharing. We simply have to look beyond their implications for asset pricing
equations and the joint behavior of aggregate consumption and exchange rates to nd their
predictions for individual goods or categories of goods. While this is not possible in cases
where only the behavior of the consumption aggregate is modeledfor example, Verdelhan
(2010), Colacito and Croce (2011), or Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013)it is possible for
the models cited above, in which preference dierences are specied over individual tradable
goods, or in which there are specic trade frictions over some goods.

5 Conclusion
Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) oer a powerful tool for constructing a lower bound on the
variation of all agents' IMRSs. Their lower bound is constructed from a reduced-form SDF,
which can be thought of as a common component of all agents' IMRSs, and relies only on
asset return data and the assumption of no-arbitrage. Unfortunately, reduced-form SDFs,
combined with asset return and exchange rate data, cannot be used in the same way to
identify economically meaningful dierences between agents' IMRSs.
Our positive message is that structural models  with explicit assumptions about preferences over goods, goods market frictions, or asset market imperfections  are necessary, and
useful, to address specic questions about real exchange rate determination and risk sharing.
We are certainly not the rst to recognize this point. An early example is Backus and Smith
(1993), who examine the possibility that non-traded goods may account for several striking
features of international macroeconomic data. In order to focus on this friction in the goods

of exchange rates holds, variation in the real exchange rate only reects frictions and/or
preferences dierences in the goods market. It does not reect heterogeneity across agents
in dierent economies in the compensation for risk they require to own various assets such
as currencies.

In this appendix we outline an example of a full-edged model of an endowment economy
that is consistent with the discussion in Section 4 of the paper.

The model is based on

Backus and Smith (1993), and we use it to illustrate how aggregate consumption levels and
the real exchange rate are jointly determined in equilibrium.

(c1f , c2f , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , cnf ), P d = (1, Pd2 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , Pdn ) and P f = (1, Pf2 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , Pfn ). We use a version of the
model in which there are two periods, with time indexed by t = 0, 1. In the most general
To make our notation compact we dene the

version of the model, asset markets are assumed to be incomplete, but we also explore a

Price Indices and the Real Exchange Rate
Given a particular set of prices for the individual goods, we can solve the domestic agent's
static expenditure minimization problem

min P d ¬∑ cd
cd,1

subject to

cd = cd (cd ) .

(71)

cd (¬∑) is a homogenous of degree one function, minimized expenditure is equal to
Pd cd where Pd = Hd (P d ), with Hd (¬∑) also being homogenous of degree one in its arguments,
and having a form related to the function cd (¬∑) (see Varian, 1984). Similarly, the foreign
price index is Pf = Hf (P f ). Since all prices are measured in the same numeraire, the real
exchange rate is e ‚â° Pf /Pd .
In the special case where cd (¬∑) = cf (¬∑), we have Hd (¬∑) = Hf (¬∑). If, additionally, all
goods are frictionlessly traded, e = 1. If preferences dier across countries and all goods are
j
j
frictionlessly traded, variation in the real exchange rate can arise even though Pd = Pf for
all j .

A Specic Model Under Complete Markets
We adopt the following assumptions: (1) There are two goods,
the numeraire, and being frictionlessly traded. (2)

u(¬∑) = ln(¬∑),

2, with good 1 being
cd (c1d , c2d ) = (c1d )Œ∏d (c2d )1‚àíŒ∏d

and

(3)

cf (c1f , c2f ) = (c1f )Œ∏f (c2f )1‚àíŒ∏f . These assumptions imply that the CPIs in the two countries,
measured in units of good 1, are
and

Pd = œÅd (Pd2 )1‚àíŒ∏d ,
with

œÅd = Œ∏d‚àíŒ∏d (1 ‚àí Œ∏d )Œ∏d ‚àí1 ,

and

œÅf = Œ∏f

and

Pf = œÅf (Pf2 )1‚àíŒ∏f ,

(1 ‚àí Œ∏f )Œ∏f ‚àí1 .

(76)

The real exchange rate is

e = (œÅf /œÅd )[(Pf2 )1‚àíŒ∏f /(Pd2 )1‚àíŒ∏d ] .

(77)

We discuss two specic examples of our model, which assume, alternatively, that good

is frictionlessly traded or nontraded. We use the following notation, and henceforth drop the
notational dependence of time 1 variables on

The domestic agent's share of the global endowment of good j at time t is st = ydt /Yt ,

Both Goods are Frictionlessly Traded.

When both goods are frictionlessly traded, we

drop location subscripts from the price of good

2, and we write the market clearing conditions

for goods as

c1d,0 + c1f,0 = Y01

(89)

c1d,1 (œâ) + c1f,1 (œâ) = Y11 (œâ)

c2d,0 + c2f,0 = Y02

(91)

c2d,1 (œâ) + c2f,1 (œâ) = Y12 (œâ)

(92)

To solve the model we let eliminate unknowns by solving for them in terms of the domestic
agent's expenditure at time 0, which we denote
agent's expenditure at time 0 as

Fd = c1d,0 + P02 c2d,0 .

Because the price of good 2 is the same in both economies, from Eq. (77) we can see that the
logarithm of the real exchange rate in each period is just

ln e = ln(œÅf /œÅd ) + (Œ∏d ‚àí Œ∏f ) ln(P 2 ).

Hence, from Eq. (108), the log change in the real exchange rate is

Given the form of the utility function, domestic aggregate consumption growth is

ln[cd,1 (œâ)/cd,0 ] = Œ∏d ln[c1d,1 (œâ)/c1d,0 ] + (1 ‚àí Œ∏d ) ln[c2d,1 (œâ)/c2d,0 ].

(115)

c2d,1 (œâ)/c2d,0 = G2 (œâ) ,

œâ ‚àà ‚Ñ¶.

(116)

Hence, Eq. (114) can be rewritten as

ln[cd,1 (œâ)/cd,0 ] = Œ∏d ln G1 (œâ) + (1 ‚àí Œ∏d ) ln G2 (œâ).

(117)

Similarly, for the foreign agent, aggregate consumption growth is

ln[cf,1 (œâ)/cf,0 ] = Œ∏f ln G1 (œâ) + (1 ‚àí Œ∏f ) ln G2 (œâ).

One Good is Not Traded.

(118)

We now assume that it is not possible to trade good

the two economies. Thus, we replace the market clearing conditions for good

2 between

2,

(91) and

(92), with the following equations:

2
c2d,0 = yd,0

c2d,1 (œâ) = yd,1

Because agents have the same preferences, from Eq. (77) we can see that the logarithm of

In the lifetime budget constraint, Eq. (88), if we use

Similarly, for the foreign agent, aggregate consumption growth is

ln[cf,1 (œâ)/cf,0 ] = Œ∏ ln G1 (œâ) + (1 ‚àí Œ∏) ln gf2 (œâ).

A Representative Agent Model.

(143)

We now consider a model with a single representative

agent whose preferences have the same functional form as in the previous examples, and
whose endowments correspond to the global endowments of the two goods. The agent also
has access to a complete set of state contingent claims. Letting
on consumption in period 0, and letting

Œ∏

F

be the agent's expenditure

be the weight on good

1

in the utility function,

we can write the rst order conditions as

c10 = Œ∏F.

Given that in equilibrium the agent eats the global endowments of the two goods we have

c10 = Y01 , c20 = Y02 , c11 (œâ) = Y11 (œâ), and c21 (œâ) = Y12 (œâ), so it follows immediately from the

PZ (œâ) = Œ≤œÄ(œâ)/G1 (œâ). The price of a state contingent claim against state œâ is the same as
in the model with two agents. So is the rate of change of the price of good 2:
