Nine Facts about Top Journals in Economics
David Card and Stefano DellaVigna
NBER Working Paper No. 18665
January 2013
JEL No. A1,A11
ABSTRACT
How has publishing in top economics journals changed since 1970? Using a data set that combines
information on all articles published in the top-5 journals from 1970 to 2012 with their Google Scholar
citations, we identify nine key trends. First, annual submissions to the top-5 journals nearly doubled
from 1990 to 2012. Second, the total number of articles published in these journals actually declined
from 400 per year in the late 1970s to 300 per year most recently. As a result, the acceptance rate has
fallen from 15% to 6%, with potential implications for the career progression of young scholars. Third,
one journal, the American Economic Review, now accounts for 40% of top-5 publications, up from
25% in the 1970s. Fourth, recently published papers are on average 3 times longer than they were
in the 1970s, contributing to the relative shortage of journal space. Fifth, the number of authors per
paper has increased from 1.3 in 1970 to 2.3 in 2012, partly offsetting the fall in the number of articles
per year. Sixth, citations for top-5 publications are high: among papers published in the late 1990s,
the median number of Google Scholar citations is 200. Seventh, the ranking of journals by citations
has remained relatively stable, with the notable exception of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, which
climbed from fourth place to first place over the past three decades. Eighth, citation counts are significantly
higher for longer papers and those written by more co-authors. Ninth, although the fraction of articles
from different fields published in the top-5 has remained relatively stable, there are important cohort
trends in the citations received by papers from different fields, with rising citations to more recent
papers in Development and International, and declining citations to recent papers in Econometrics
and Theory.

1. Introduction
Publications in the top journals have a powerful influence on the direction of research
in economics, on the career paths of young researchers, and on the pay of academic
economists. To what extent has the publication process in these journals changed over the past
few decades?
In this paper we present a descriptive overview of trends among the papers published
in the “top‐5” economics journals: the American Economic Review (AER), Econometrica (EMA),
the Journal of Political Economy (JPE), the Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), and the Review
of Economic Studies (RES). We combine data from EconLit on all articles published in these
outlets since 1970 with matched citation data from Google Scholar and annual submission
counts from the journals.1 Our analysis builds on the study by Ellison (2002) but extends his
work in several directions, including the consideration of paper‐specific citations.2 A
complementary analysis by Hamermesh (2012) provides a more detailed analysis of a subset of
articles in three of the top‐5 journals, focusing on the characteristics of authors and of methods
employed, which we do not consider.3
We identify nine key trends. First, the number of yearly submissions nearly doubled
from 1990 to 2012, affecting all the top‐5 journals except the Journal of Political Economy.
Second, the total number of articles published in the top journals declined from about 400 per
year in the late 1970s to around 300 per year in 2010‐12. The combination of rising
submissions and falling publications led to a sharp fall in the aggregate acceptance rate, from
around 15% in 1980 to 6% today. The increasing difficulty in publishing in the top‐5 journals
may have important implications for the setting of hiring and promotion benchmarks in the
field.
Third, the American Economic Review is the only top‐5 journal that has substantially
increased the number of articles it publishes per year, and as a result now accounts for 40% of
top journal publications in the field, up from 25% in 1970. Assuming that promotion, hiring,
and pay decisions continue to value the top‐5 journals more or less equally, the AER now exerts
a substantially larger influence over the field than it used to.
Fourth, published papers in the top‐5 journals are nearly 3 times longer today than they
were in the 1970s. Though the journals as a group have increased their total pages, they have
not fully adjusted, leading to the decline in the number of published papers. Fifth, the number
of authors per paper has increased monotonically from 1.3 in 1970 to 2.3 in 2012, partly
offsetting the decrease in the number of articles published per year. Indeed, weighting each
paper by the number of co‐authors, the number of authors with a top‐5 journal article in a
1

As explained below, we exclude papers published in the Annual Papers and Proceedings Issue of the AER, as well
as notes, comments, and announcements.
2
Griffith, Kocherlakota, and Nevo (2009) conduct many of the same analyses as us, though their paper is focused
on the relative performance of the Review of Economic Studies versus the other four journals in the top five.

There is an extensive literature on the rankings of journals (and authors) that summarize various measures of
citations: see for example, Kalaitzidakis, Stengos and Mamuneas (2003) and Ellison (2010).

given year is somewhat higher today than in the 1970s or 1980s.
Sixth, papers published in the top‐5 economics journals are highly cited: among those
published in the late 1990s, for example, the median article has about 200 Google Scholar
citations. Citations for more recently published articles are lower, reflecting the fact that it
takes time to accumulate citations. Interestingly, papers published in the 1970s and 1980s also
have total citation counts below those of papers published in the 1990s, reflecting the nature
of the sources used by Google Scholar, citation practices of current authors, and other
potential factors.
Seventh, citation‐based rankings of the top‐5 journals are fairly stable over time, with
the notable exception of the Quarterly Journal of Economics which climbed from second‐to‐last
to first place among the top‐5. Eighth, citations are strongly increasing in both the length of a
paper and the number of coauthors, suggesting that trends in both dimensions may be driven
in part by quality competition. The effects hold both when predicting the number of citations
(in logs) and when predicting the probability of an article in the top 5% of citations in a given
year.
Ninth, despite the relative stability of the distribution of published articles across fields,
there are interesting differences in the relative citation rates of newer and older papers in
different fields. In particular, papers in Development and International Economics published
since 1990 are more highly cited than older (pre‐1990) papers in these fields, whereas recent
papers in Econometrics and Theory are less cited than older papers in these fields.
2. Data
We use data from three main sources. First, we use EconLit to construct a database of
all articles published in the top‐5 journals since 1970. We extract information for each article
on the number and names of author(s), the title, the JEL codes, and the page length. We use a
text search of titles to exclude papers that can be identified as comments, replies, corrections,
or announcements.4 We also exclude articles in the Papers and Proceedings issue of the AER.
Unlike Ellison (2002), we do not distinguish between full‐length and shorter articles. Our final
data set includes 13,245 articles published between 1970 and 2012. The Online Data Appendix
provides a detailed overview of the main characteristics of the data set, and information on the
way we classify older and current JEL codes into a consistent set of major fields.
Our second data source is information from the top‐5 journals on the number of annual
submissions. We complement the data assembled by Ellison (2002) with information from the
editor’s reports published in AER and EMA, as well as with personal communication from the
editors of JPE, QJE, and RES. We were unable to obtain submission information for ECA prior to
1974, for QJE in the period from 1977 to 1989 (inclusive), and for RES prior to 1978.
4

Our extraction from EconLit found 882 comments, 510 replies, 104 errata, 156 “discussions”, and 132 other
types of non‐refereed entries, such as editor’s reports. Note that we do not exclude shorter papers published in
Econometrica as “Notes and Comments”.

2

Our third data source is the total number of Google Scholar citations to each article, as
retrieved from Google Scholar in October 2012. We first used an automated web‐scraping
program to query Google Scholar with the exact title of each article. This process successfully
retrieved citations for about 95% of articles. Many of the remaining 5% of articles have a
typographical or spelling error in the title in Econlit or Google Scholar. For these articles, a team
of research assistants searched the citations by hand. We have at least one Google Scholar
citation for 98.7% of articles. A spot check of the remaining 176 articles suggests that most are
relatively short papers that received little attention in the subsequent literature. More details
on this procedure are in the Online Appendix.
3. Findings
Number of Submissions. Figure 1 shows the annual numbers of submissions to each of
the top‐5 journals, as well as the total count for all five journals. (Appendix Table 1 shows the
corresponding raw data) Total submissions have nearly doubled since 1990, from about 2,800
per year to 5,800 submissions in 2011. The increases are especially large for QJE and RES, but
are clearly present for all the journals except JPE, which received about the same number of
submissions in 2011 as in 1987‐1989. It is also interesting to note that most of the secular
increase in submissions documented in the figure has occurred since the year 2000. One
important implication of this surge is that editors and referees at the top‐5 journals are facing a
growing workload, even ignoring changes in the complexity of the papers they are handling
(Ellison, 2002).
Number of Articles Published. Figure 2 (with the raw data in Appendix Table 2) displays
a less‐well‐known trend: over the past three decades the top‐5 economics journals have
tended to publish a smaller number of articles per year. During the period from 1970 to 1975,
the top‐5 published an average of 341 articles per year. The number increased to an average
of 398 articles during the 1976‐80 period, then began a long period of decline, falling to 325
articles per year in the 1980s and around 250 per year or less in the late 1990s. Over the 2001‐
2010 period the number recovered very slightly (to around 275 articles per year), and then
increased again in 2011‐12 to 307 articles, largely because of the decision of the AER to
increase the number of issues per year from 4 to 6 (not counting the Papers and Proceedings
issue). Even taking into account this recent increase, the number of articles published by the 5‐
top journals is 20% lower today than during the 1976‐1980 period, despite the large increase in
submissions.
Which journals are most responsible for the decline in the number of articles
published? The largest decreases are for Econometrica, which cut the average number of
articles per year from around 100 in the 1970s to 60 today, and the Journal of Political
Economy, which published 85 articles per year in the 1970s but now publishes only 30 articles
per year. The QJE and RES also experienced declines but of smaller magnitudes. Only the
American Economic Review has increased the number of articles published today relative to
3

the late 1970s, from about 100 per year to around 125 per year.
An interesting consequence of these trends is that the AER now accounts for a
significantly larger share of top‐5 journal publications, up from 25% in the late 1970s to 40% in
the years 2011‐12. In contrast, the JPE, which also published about one‐quarter of all top‐5
articles in the late 1970s, now publishes less than 10% of these articles. Stated differently, in
the late 1970s the AER and the JPE had about equal say in the gatekeeping process that
determined publications in the top‐5 journals. Now the AER has 4 times greater weight than
the JPE.
In the absence of micro data on the manuscripts submitted to the top‐5 journals, we
form a rough estimate of the “acceptance rate” for a given journal in year t by dividing the
number of published articles in year t by the average of the number of submissions in years t‐1
and t‐2. Figure 3 (with the raw data in Appendix Table 3) illustrates the trends over time in the
estimated acceptance rates. As expected given the trends in submissions and publications,
acceptance rates have fallen across the board. Comparing 1976‐1980 to the most recent
period (2011‐2012), the acceptance rate declined from 13.8% to 8.1% for the AER, from 27.1%
to 8.5% for Econometrica, and from 13.3% to 4.8% for the JPE. While comparable data are
unavailable for the QJE and RES, using an earlier period we document a decrease for the QJE
from 10.9% in the early 1970s to 3.5% in 2011‐12. For the RES, we document a decline in the
acceptance rate from an average of 16.9% in the early 1980s to an average of 5.5% today.
Currently, the QJE is the most selective of the top‐5 journals, with an acceptance rate of
around 3%, followed by the JPE and RES, with acceptance rates of around 5%. The least
selective of the top‐5 are AER and Econometrica, with acceptance rates of around 8%.
The patterns documented here have potential implications for the careers of
economists. Over time, and especially during the last 15 years, it has become increasingly
difficult to publish in the top‐5 journals. Other things equal, this suggests that hiring and
promotion benchmarks based on top‐5 publications (e.g., “at least 1 top‐5 publication for
tenure”) are significantly harder to reach. As we discuss below, however, a partial offsetting
factor is the number of authors per paper, which has expanded relatively quickly, perhaps in
part as a reaction to the increasing difficulty in publishing in the top outlets. Another
implication of the data in Figure 2 is that, to the extent that publications in top‐5 journals are
valued equally, the AER now carries substantially more weight in determining the job
opportunities and salaries of economists than other top‐5 journals, while the JPE has declined
in influence.
Length of Articles. Next, we present evidence on the page length of articles. Since
journals have different formatting, we estimate the average number of characters in a typical
page of each journal, and renormalize the length of each published article to its length as a
standard manuscript formatted with 1.5‐spacing, 12‐point font, and 1‐inch margins (see Card
and DellaVigna 2012 for details). This adjustment takes into account changes in formatting at
the AER, which moved from a two‐column format to a single column format in 2008, and
4

adopted a less dense single column format in 2011.5 Still, the adjustment is not perfect, as for
example it does not take into account the different formatting of Tables and Figures.
Figure 4 shows that the average (standardized) length has increased from 16 pages in
the early 1970s to 45.5 pages in 2011‐12, a nearly 300% increase.6 Put differently, a paper in
the 10% percentile of lengths in 2012 is longer than a paper in the 90% percentile of lengths in
the early 1970s.
Is the increase due to a particular journal? We document in Card and DellaVigna (2012)
that the five journals moved in a remarkably parallel way over time. The normalization of page
limits plays an important role here because without standardization the QJE – which uses a
relatively low‐density format ‐‐ appears to publish much longer papers than the other top‐5. In
reality the QJE papers are about the same length as papers in the other top 5 journals in a
given year.
We suspect that the steady growth in the length of published papers is a major factor in
explaining the fall in the number of articles published in the top‐5 outlets each year. Even with
a sizable increase in the total number of pages published by each journal, the increase in the
length of papers has been so rapid that it has forced a cut in the number of articles published
per issue. Of course, this constraint could be relaxed by publishing more issues per year, but so
far only the AER has responded in this way.
We have also looked at trends in paper length by field. Perhaps surprisingly, we find
that papers in nearly all fields – including theory and econometrics – have become longer over
the past 40 years.
Number of Coauthors. Figure 4 shows that the number of authors per paper has also
grown steadily, though less quickly than average paper length. In the early 1970s, three
quarters of articles were single‐authored, and the average number of authors in a paper was
1.3. By the early 1990s the fraction of single authored papers had fallen to 50%, and the mean
number of authors reached 1.6. Most recently (2011‐2012), more than three quarters of
papers have at least 2 authors and the mean number of authors is 2.2.
As noted earlier, the rising number of authors per paper means than despite a smaller
number of papers per year in the top‐5 journals, the number of authors with papers in the top‐
5 (i.e., the number of papers published multiplied by the average number of authors per paper)
has actually trended upward.7 This series is plotted in Appendix Figure 1, and is fairly stable
ranging between 400 and 550 from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. Since the year 2000, this
figure has however increase reaching 600 or more in 2010‐2011. To the extent that co‐
authored papers are as valuable as single‐authored papers, the rise in co‐authorship has
mitigated the fall in the number of papers published per year, though relative to submission
5

We are grateful to Steve Stelling, managing editor of AER, for explaining these changes.
Previous studies have also noted the steady rise in page lengths among top economics journals, including Ellison
(2002) and Griffith, Kocherlakota, and Nevo (2009).
7
This statistic does not adjust for the fact that some individual authors may have more than one paper in a top
journal in a given year.
6

5

flows the author‐weighted number of papers per year in the top‐5 journals has still failed to
keep pace.8
Citations. Figure 5 shows the median number of Google Scholar citations (measured as
of October 2012) for the articles published in the top‐5 journals in each year of our sample (see
also Appendix Table 4). Note first the inverse U‐shaped pattern of the citation counts for each
of the journals and for the top‐5 outlets as a whole. The pattern of lower citations for the most
recent articles is expected, since recently published papers have had less time to accumulate
citations. The pattern of lower total citations for older articles is more surprising, and arguably
reflects the nature of Google Scholar, which searches through on‐line working papers and
publications and is therefore less likely to find citations to older papers.9 The most‐cited
articles in our data are those published between 1995 and 2000.
A second interesting feature of the data in Figure 5 is the relatively high number of
citations to top‐5 publications. Among papers published in the 1990‐2000 period, the median
number of Google Scholar citations is typically around 200. A citation count of 200 is relatively
impressive, and reflects the success of the top‐5 journals in identifying high‐impact papers, or
in inducing high impact by virtue of publication in a top outlet, two possibilities we cannot
distinguish.
A third interesting feature of Figure 5 is the relative ranking of citations for articles in
different journals. Median citations for articles in the American Economic Review and the
Journal of Political Economy tend to be quite similar from year to year – for example, around
100 in the late 1980s, between 250 and 300 in the mid‐1990s, and around 130 in 2005. In the
earlier years of our sample, articles in Econometrica have about the same median citations as
those in the AER or the JPE. Starting in the 1990s, however, there is a discernible fall in the
relative impact of ECA articles. Articles in the Review of Economic Studies tend to be the least‐
cited among the top‐5 journals, although RES’s relative position appears to be improving in the
last few years.
Perhaps the most obvious feature of Figure 5 is the dramatic increase in relative
citations for articles in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. Until the early 1990s, articles
published in the QJE tended to have relatively low citations, on par with those in RES.
Remarkably, though, between 1990 and 1992 median citations for articles in the QJE rise to the
top of the group. Indeed, in the years from 1994 to 2004, median citations for articles in QJE
are about two times larger than median citations for articles in AER and JPE, and about three
times the median for articles in ECA and RES. Median citations for more recently published
articles are lower, but the QJE remains the journal with the highest median citations per paper
8

Hilmer, Hilmer and Ransom’s (2012) recent analysis of academic economists’ salaries suggests that co‐authored
papers are as valuable as single authored papers, conditional on the number of citations they receive.
9
Specifically, citations in older working papers that are not posted on the internet will not be counted. Griffith,
Kocherlakota and Nevo (2009) conduct a small scale comparison between citations in Google Scholar, ISI Web of
Knowledge, and Citations in Economics. They find a relatively high degree of correlation between the three
sources of citations across 20 randomly selected papers.

6

in all years from 1991 to 2011.
The large swings of citations over time in Figure 5 make it somewhat hard to compare
citations across journals in the earlier and later years. In Figure 6 we plot the year‐by‐year
share of Google Scholar citations for a given journal compared to all citations to articles in top‐
5 journals in that year, relative to the share of number of papers for that same journal out of all
top‐5 articles in that year. So for example all the articles published in the AER in 2000 account
for 34.9% of all the citations to top‐5 journal articles in that year, but the AER accounts for only
30.6% of articles published in economics in 2000; hence, the AER has a relative share of 1.14,
reflecting a disproportionate citation influence by about 14%. The series is smoothed using a 5‐
year centered moving average. We note that this measure reflects mean, as opposite to
median, citations. The graph shows that in the 1970s the JPE is the leading journal by this
measure, followed by Econometrica in the 1980s. Interestingly, Econometrica’s impact in the
1908s is higher when considering mean, as opposed to median, citations. The citation impact
of both JPE and Econometrica declines sharply in the 1990s, while the impact of the QJE rises
quickly at the same time. The graph also shows a slow but steady improvement for the impact
of the Review of Economic Studies since the late 1990s. Finally, the American Economic Review
stays at a relatively constant citation share of about 1, except in the early 1970s when it was
higher.
Median and mean citation rates give a potentially limited summary of the impact of the
articles published in a given journal. To provide a more complete picture, we show in Figure 7
the cumulative distribution functions (censored at 1000 citations) for citations of articles
published in the top‐5 journals over the period 1990‐2009. The relative rankings of the journals
are consistent at virtually all quantiles and confirm the patterns in Figures 5 and 6. In
particular, the AER and JPE have relatively similar distributions, and both dominate ECA and
RES. The QJE is the citation leader, with the smallest fraction of poorly‐cited articles (e.g. only
13% of papers have less than 50 citations, versus 18% at AER and JPE, 26% at ECA, and 30% at
RES) and the highest fraction of very highly‐cited papers (e.g., 10% of QJE papers have over
1,000 Google Scholar citations, versus about 5% of articles at each of the other top‐5 journals).
Appendix Figure 2 plots the corresponding cumulative distribution functions for the earlier
years 1970‐1989. In these years, the QJE is dominated by the citation record of ECA, AER, and
JPE.
A Regression Analysis of Citations. To complement this descriptive analysis of citation
patterns by journal we conduct a regression‐based analysis, using as the dependent variable
the log of the number of citations for each of the 13,089 papers published in the top‐5 journals
since 1970. Citations are extremely skewed; log citations are nearly symmetrically distributed,
with only a small degree of kurtosis. Moreover, a proportional model for the effect of factors
like time‐since‐publication, field, and page length is conceptually attractive and readily
interpretable. The downside is that we have to drop the 1.3 percent of papers with no
citations. However, experiments with alternative functional forms (such as log(citations+1) or
7

the inverse hyperbolic sine function) suggest that our findings are quite robust.
Table 1 presents a selection of our estimated regression models. We begin in column 1
with a baseline model that includes a quartic function of years since publication (to capture the
time patterns shown in Figure 5) and dummies for each journal, interacted with an indicator for
pre‐1990 or post‐1990 publications.10 This simple model has an R‐squared coefficient of 18%.
Looking at the journal effects for the pre‐1990 cohort, the estimates suggest that all the other
journals had higher citations than RES (the base group). Papers in JPE had the highest citation
rates (estimated effect=0.55), while those in the AER and ECA had somewhat lower rates
(estimated effects = 0.42 and 0.37, respectively), and papers in the QJE were only slightly more
likely to be cited than those in RES (effect=0.02). Post‐1990 the AER and JPE are nearly equal
(estimated effects = 0.40 and 0.37, respectively), while citations to Econometrica papers have
fallen sharply to about the same level as RES papers (estimated effect = 0.07). As suggested in
Figure 5, the big “winner” is the QJE, which moved substantially ahead of all other journals
after 1990, with a 78 log point citation premium over pre‐1990 RES papers.
An obvious question is whether the rise in citations to QJE papers (and fall in citations
to papers in ECA) can be explained in part by observable characteristics of the papers. One
possible factor is field: in the past two decades, for example, the QJE has published a relatively
high fraction of applied papers, while Econometrica tends to publish theoretical papers. To
assess the importance of field composition, we classify JEL codes into 14 mutually exclusive
fields.11 We assign each JEL code provided by the authors to one of these fields: hence, if the
author provided 2 JEL codes, we have either 1 or 2 field dummies set to 1 for the article
(depending on if the 2 JEL codes fall under the same field).
Figure 8 (and the corresponding Appendix Table 5) shows the relative frequencies of
the various fields in the top‐5 journals as a whole. As shown by the total height of the graph,
the number of fields papers are assigned to has risen over our sample period from an average
of about 1.6 per article to nearly 2. Nevertheless, the relative shares of the different fields are
fairly constant over time: theory is the largest field, accounting for about 30% of all articles;
macro is next (about 20% of papers); labor and microeconomics are tied for third (16‐17%
each); and econometrics, IO, and international each account for about 10‐12% of papers).
The field distributions of papers in the different journals largely conform to
expectations. For example, theory papers are under‐represented in the QJE and JPE while
labor and IO papers are under‐represented in ECA. Conversely, theory and econometrics
papers are over‐represented in ECA and RES, while labor papers are more likely to appear in
the QJE, and IO and international papers are more prevalent in the AER.

10

Models that allow the journal effects to vary by 5‐year publication cohort are very similar.
See the Online Data Appendix. Our fields are economic theory, microeconomics, econometric theory,
macroeconomics, international, finance, public, labor, history, IO, development, lab‐based experiments, other
applied micro fields (health, urban, law and economics), and all other fields. Our classification is similar to the one
used by Ellison (2002).

The model in column 2 of Table 1 introduces field dummies to the citation model.12
Although several of the field indicators are highly significant, their inclusion has relatively small
impacts on the estimated journal×cohort effects, implying that trends in the citation counts for
articles in different journals are largely due to factors other than field. One small difference is
Econometrica: adding field effects slightly moderates the decline in citations for ECA
publications relative to pre‐1990 AER papers (from a 36% decline to a 26% decline). A look at
the estimated field effects explains this difference. The largest positive field effects (relative to
the generic “all other fields” category) are for development (+43%), finance (+35%), labor
(+25%), and other empirical micro (+20%), all applied fields that are substantially under‐
represented in ECA relative to the other top‐5 journals, particularly since 1990.13
The model in column 3 of the table adds controls for the length of each paper and
number of co‐authors. Specifically, we divide the overall distribution of normalized page
lengths into quintiles, and include dummies for the four highest quintiles of length. We also
include a full set of dummies for different numbers of co‐authors (censoring the count at 9). As
suggested by the rather large rise in the R‐squared of the model (from 20% to 32%), these two
features are very powerful predictors of future citations. Relative to a paper in the first quintile
of normalized page lengths (12.5 pages or less), mean log citations for a paper in the second
quintile (12.5 to 20.5 pages) are 0.92 higher (i.e., 250% more citations); mean log citations for a
paper in the third quintile (20.5 to 28 pages) are 1.37 higher (i.e., 393% more cites), mean log
citations for a paper in the fourth quintile (29 to 38 pages) are 1.65 higher (i.e., 680% higher),
and mean log citations for a paper in the fifth quintile (39+ pages) are 1.92 higher (i.e., 520%
higher). Similarly, relative to a single‐authored paper, mean log citations for a paper with two,
three or four authors are 0.21, 0.26, and 0.47 higher, respectively, implying 23%, 30%, and 60%
more citations. The findings on the impact of paper length and number of coauthors are
consistent with Hamermesh and Oster (2002) and Ellison (2011).
Interestingly, controls for length and number of co‐authors also have some effect on
the relative rankings of the journals in different cohorts. Controls for length improve the
apparent status of AER papers because the AER publishes a relatively large number of “Shorter
Papers”, which get fewer citations, on average. They also lead to a somewhat more positive
assessment of the QJE prior to 1990 (when the QJE tended to publish relatively few long
papers).
Finally, in column 4 we present a model that allows the impacts of different fields to
change over time. As has been noted by earlier analysts (including Ellison, 2002, and Griffith,
Kocherlakota, and Nevo, 2009), it appears that relatively few recent papers in economic theory
12

We include dummies indicating the fields assigned to a paper (up to 6), with “other fields” as the omitted
dummy. Since the dummies do not sum to 1, we also include a variable representing the number of JEL codes
provided by the paper. This gives numerically identical estimates to a specification in which we simply include all
the dummies.
13
All four of these field effects are statistically significant. The other significant field effects are for
microeconomics (+17%), IO (+14%), and history (‐68%).

and econometric theory have had the widespread influence of the “classic” papers in these
areas from the 1970s and 1980s. To control for such changes, we include field dummies and
interactions of these dummies with an indicator for post‐1990 publication date. While crude,
this specification captures any changing citation potential for papers from different fields in the
pre‐ and post‐1990 eras.
The estimated interactions of the field dummies with post‐1990 indicators confirm that
the impact of theory and econometrics papers has declined. (The estimated interaction effects
are ‐0.33 and ‐0.12, respectively; the theory interaction is highly significant). At the same time,
the impacts of papers in international, development and macro have all risen substantially.
(The estimated interaction effects are +0.51, +0.22, and +0.25, respectively, and are all
significant at conventional levels). Adding these controls has a small effect on the estimated
journal×cohort effects, and in particular leads to a rise in the relative status of post‐1990
papers in Econometrica. Overall, however, the journal×cohort effects in column 4 of Table 1
are remarkably similar to those in column 1, and we conclude that measured characteristics of
the papers published by the different journals in different time periods can explain only a small
part of the differences in citations to these papers.
Finally, in Column 5 we estimate a similar model as in Column 3, but we focus the
attention only on the top‐cited articles. Namely, we estimate a linear probability model with an
indicator variable for an article in the top 5% of citations in a given year as dependent
variable.14 This allows us to estimate whether the impact of journal, paper length, and number
of authors holds also at the very top. Interestingly, the answer is yes. The ranking of journals is
largely unaffected, with the most positive estimated effect being for the Quarterly Journal of
Economics in the period 1990‐2012, with an estimated increase of 5.5 percentage points in the
probability of publishing a top 5% cited article relative to the omitted category (the Review of
Economic Studies in 1970‐89), a large effect. Even larger is the effect of paper length: a paper
in the fifth quantile is associated with an 11 percent point higher probability of being in the top
5% of citations, that is, a tripling of probability relative to the mean such probability of 4.8
percentage points. Finally, the number of coauthors also has a positive effect, if a smaller one.
3. Conclusions
In this paper we have presented evidence on trends in submissions, articles published,
selectivity, length, co‐authorship, field, and citations for papers in the top‐5 economics
journals. On the one hand, much has changed over the past forty years. There are many more
submissions, but fewer papers are published per year. Perhaps because of this intensifying
competition, each paper has more co‐authors. Papers today are also substantially longer, even
in the most technical fields. So far, only the American Economic Review has responded to the
increasing average length of papers by publishing more issues per year. As a direct result, the
14

The cut‐offs for top 5% citation are 618 in 1970, 501 in 1975, 566 in 1980, 781 in 1985, 1596 in 1990, 1477 in
1995, 1154 in 2000, 592 in 2005, 223 in 2010.

AER now publishes 40% of the total number of papers in the top‐5 outlets. On the other hand,
citation based rankings of the top‐5 journals are relatively stable over the past 40 years. The
two major shifts are a fall in the relative impact of papers in Econometrica, and the remarkable
transformation of the Quarterly Journal of Economics from a comparatively low‐citation outlet
to the journal with the most highly‐cited articles of the top‐5.
We believe that these findings have potentially significant implications for academic
economists, particularly with regard to the career paths of younger scholars. Most importantly,
the competition for space in the top journals has grown fiercer over time. The overall
acceptance rate for submissions at the top‐5 journals is about one‐third as high today as in the
early 1970s. This trend is independent of the trend documented by Ellison (2002) toward
longer delays in the adjudication and revision process, and in fact has largely emerged in the
decade since Ellison’s original investigation. Both lower acceptance rates and longer delays,
however, make it increasingly difficult for any one author to achieve a given set of publication
benchmarks. Authors have clearly responded by forming bigger teams, and to the extent that
co‐authored papers are treated as equivalent to single authored papers (e.g., Hilmer, Hilmer
and Ransom, 2012), they have been able to partially mitigate the adverse effects of lower
acceptance rates and longer delays.
Our findings also have important implications for the interpretation of the trend in the
length of economics articles. This trend is often interpreted as evidence of failure: either by
authors – who have failed to communicate their findings in a concise way – or by referees and
editors – who have been misled by “fluff”, or have demanded too much secondary material.
The very large positive effects of paper length on citation counts suggest instead that longer
papers may be better papers. One interpretation is that as the competition for journal space
has increased, authors have improved the quality of their papers and in the process made
them longer. Whether we want to regulate this competition by restricting the length of
papers, or adopt to it by increasing the number of “pages” published by the top journals is
clearly an interesting policy issue. In Card and DellaVigna (2012) we examine the impact of the
imposition of page limits at the American Economic Review and at the Journal of the European
Economic Association, and show that authors respond differently—whether by shortening
papers or by sending them to another journal—depending on the outlet, suggesting important
differences in local monopoly power (over authors) for journals in different tiers.
Our findings also underscore the critical role of reputations among scholarly journals.
Just as the identities of the “top‐5” journals have remained constant, the relative rankings of
the top‐5 journals have remained broadly stable over 40 years. Yet, there is also clear evidence
that reputations can change: the abrupt rise in citations to articles published by the QJE after
1990 suggests that a (sustained) change in editorial policy can be effective. Similarly, the
dramatic ramp‐up in submissions at the Review of Economic Studies in the last 10 years points
to a change in appeal of the journal.
Finally, our results raise the question of “Why the Top Five?” Clearly, there are
11

differences in the impacts of the top‐5: in the 1970s an article published in the AER or JPE had
about 40% more citations than one in the QJE or Review of Economic Studies. More recently,
an article in the QJE is 30 or 40% more likely to be cited than one in the AER. Furthermore, as
the number (and complexity) of economics papers has increased, 5 journals, publishing only
400 or so articles per year, represent an increasingly limited resource for the profession.

Field Classification System.
We assign the papers in our sample to fields based on their JEL codes. Less than 1% of
the papers do not provide a JEL code, while 32% provide one JEL code, 39% provide two, 22%
provide three, and 6% provide between four and seven, with the mean number of JEL codes
provided being 2.0. Our fields are mutually exclusive, but we allow papers to be assigned to as
many fields as the number of JEL codes they provide. 52% of the papers are assigned to one
field, 38% to two, 9% to three, and 1% to between four and six, with the mean number of fields
a paper is assigned to being 1.6.
We use the following classification system to assign post‐1990 papers to fields. Current
JEL codes consist of three digits: one letter followed by two numbers. When only one letter or
one letter and one number are provided, all of the more detailed JEL codes that fall under that
code are also included in the given field.
Fields under current JEL system (1990‐2012)
Microeconomics: D (except for the D’s in the following “micro theory” field)

The JEL system underwent a significant change in 1990. We use a mapping from the old
JEL codes to the current JEL codes published in the Journal of Economic Literature (1991) to
assign pre‐1990 papers to fields based on their JEL codes. Since most of the old JEL codes
correspond to at least five current JEL codes, there is not a one‐to‐one mapping between our
field classification system under the current JEL codes and our classification system under the
old JEL codes.

Scraping and Matching Process:
Step 1: We first download information on all works published in the American Economic
Review, Econometrica, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics and
the Review of Economic Studies for the period between 1970 till October 2012 from the EconLit
Database. The fields of information we collect are `Authors', `Title', `Publication', `Subject',
`Year', `Issue', `Volume', `Pages'.
Step 2: We then use each entry from the `Title' field to create a URL that acts as a Google
Scholar query. In particular, the URL requests Google Scholar to search for the given title
prefixed with the allintitle operator. This forces Google Scholar to only return results where
each word in our query is in the title of a given work. To give an example, this process is
equivalent to opening Google Scholar on a browser and querying “allintitle:causal effect of
education on earnings'' when searching for the work “The Causal Effect of Education on
Earnings” by David Card.

23

Step 3: Once the URLs are created, we use a python script to access each URL and download the
contents of the webpage. This step is equivalent to saving the webpage of search results after
typing in the query as in step 2.
Step 4: Once we have the webpage for each query saved, we use R to find the surname of the
first listed author for each work that is listed on the first page of search results. For example, if
the query is ``Paying not to go to the gym'' by Stefano DellaVigna and Ulrike Malmendier, the
first listed author as per Google Scholar is `S DellaVigna' and we will store `DellaVigna'. Within
our subset of works that are returned using the allintitle querying process, we match across
authors, since titles contain too much noise and do not get matched.
Step 5: charmatch is a partial string matching function in R that returns a logical TRUE
statement if the first string argument can be found within the second string argument. That is,
charmatch("hello","hello world") will return a logical TRUE statement. We use charmatch to
match the list of surnames generated in Step 4 with the information in the `Authors' field for a
given query. Continuing with the example in Step 4, we check if the string `DellaVigna' appears
in the `Authors' field from the EconLit database, which in this case contains `DellaVigna,
Stefano; Malmendier, Ulrike'. Using charmatch helps solve the problem of partially truncated
names. That is, even if Google Scholar reported the first author as `SD Vigna', our algorithm
would identify that `Vigna' is found in `DellaVigna, Stefano; Malmendier, Ulrike' and match the
two articles. The entire matching process is case insensitive. In addition, foreign special
characters such as Ä are converted to English characters before matching to resolve ambiguities
in naming conventions.
Step 6: For each positive match, we collect publication data from Google Scholar including
citations. If there is more than one positive match in the first page of 10 results, we compute
the total number of citations as the sum of citations for each positive match in that first page.
We examined a random sample of 300 matches that we verified by hand to check for any
patterns of inconsistencies. The false match rate in this sample is very low. The 5% or queries
which are unmatched are searched by hand by a team of research assistants following a similar
procedure.
