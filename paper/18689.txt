The Effects of Childhood ADHD on Adult Labor Market Outcomes

ABSTRACT
While several types of mental illness, including substance abuse disorders, have been linked with poor
labor market outcomes, no current research has been able to examine the effects of childhood ADHD.
As ADHD has become one of the most prevalent childhood mental conditions, it is useful to understand
the full set of consequences of the illness. This paper uses a longitudinal national sample, including
sibling pairs, to show important labor market outcome consequences of ADHD. The employment
reduction is between 10-14 percentage points, the earnings reduction is approximately 33%, and the
increase in social assistance is 15 points, which are larger than many estimates of the black-white earnings
gap and the gender earnings gap. A small share of the link is explained by education attainments and
co-morbid health conditions and behaviors. The results also show important differences in labor market
consequences by family background and age of onset. These findings, along with similar research
showing that ADHD is linked with poor education outcomes and adult crime, suggest that treating
childhood ADHD can substantially increase the acquisition of human capital.

Introduction
While there is a relatively large literature linking mental illness, including
substance dependence, with poor labor market outcomes, few studies have examined the
potential long term consequences of childhood mental health on adult outcomes. Those
studies that have attempted to link childhood mental illness with adult labor market
outcomes have typically focused on measures of adolescent mental health such as
depression and substance dependence (Fletcher 2009a, Ettner et al., 1997, Marcotte and
Wilcox-Gok 2003). In contrast, no studies have been able to examine long term links
between other highly prevalent childhood mental health conditions, such as Attention
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and adult labor market outcomes. Indeed,
ADHD is one of the most prevalent and fastest growing mental health problems facing
children in the US. The prevalence is typically estimated to be between 2-10% of schoolaged children, with 7.4 percent of parents with children between the age of 3-17 reporting
a doctor has told them their child has ADHD (Bloom and Cohen 2007).
There are many pathways that could reduce the labor market outcomes of adults
with childhood ADHD symptoms. There are several recent studies that show that
childhood ADHD is associated with early education outcomes, such as grade repetition
and special education placement (Currie and Stabile 2006) as well as longer term
education outcomes, including high school performance (Fletcher and Wolfe 2008,
Currie et al. 2010). Currie et al. (2010) also show evidence that ADHD is associated with
welfare receipt as a young adult. Further there is evidence that the presence of childhood
ADHD symptoms is correlated with criminal activities as a young adult (Fletcher and
Wolfe 2009). While this research is strongly suggestive of potential labor market

1

consequences of ADHD, to date no research has been able to examine this question
(Currie et al. 2010).
This paper provides the first evidence of links between childhood ADHD
symptoms and adult labor market outcomes. The data come from the national,
prospective Add Health, which tracks individuals between 7-12th grades and outcomes
around age 30. Importantly, to match previous research, this paper is able to examine
sibling differences in outcomes based on childhood ADHD diagnoses and focuses on
employment, earnings, and social assistance receipt for young adults. The consequences
of ADHD on labor market outcomes are large. For example, the findings suggest labor
market participation reductions of approximately 10 percentage points, which are robust
to including controls for co-occurring health conditions and behaviors, years of schooling
as well as family fixed effects. Earnings reductions are estimated to be approximately
30% and social assistance increases are estimated to be 15 percentage points for those
with childhood ADHD. The paper also provides evidence of differences in the effects
based on family background and age at diagnosis.

Background Literature
ADHD is a neurobehavioral developmental disorder characterized by the coexistence of both chronic attentional problems and hyperactivity. In particular,
individuals with ADHD are characterized by lags in impulse control development of
approximately 5 years (Shaw et al. 2007), which can cause impairment in a variety of
domains including problem solving, planning ahead, and understanding the actions of

2

others (AACAP 2009). 1 Symptoms typically begin before age seven but often persist
into adulthood (Nair et al. 2006). For example, Wilens et al. (2002) report persistent of
as much as 60% between childhood/adolescent symptoms and adult symptoms.
Although a controversial diagnosis because of the potential for subjectivity in
evaluation, the American Medical Association has been a proponent of its usefulness as a
disorder. 2 Further, in order to be diagnosed, an individual must show persistent
symptoms in at least two different settings (home, school, etc) for more than six months
and to a degree that is greater than children of the same age.
While much is known about the family and individual level predictors of
childhood ADHD, there are still many open questions about its specific causes. It is an
illness with high prevalence, with four and a half million children ages 3-17 reported to
have ADHD according to data from the 2006 National Health Interview Study. Briefly,
ADHD symptoms are more likely to occur in males and children in families with low
socioeconomic status, however diagnosis rates could be higher in high income families
due to differences in health care access.. A genetic link has been suggested based on the
higher prevalence among close relatives than the general population and some molecular
genetic ties to ADHD status (Biederman et al. 1990).
Treatments for ADHD also are somewhat controversial. On one hand, there is
evidence that approximately 70% of the patients with ADHD respond to treatment with
stimulant medications in the short term and over periods of up to 18 months (Olfson et al.
1

ADHD is also separated into subtypes (attention deficit and hyperactivity); inattentive symptoms include
being easily distracted, having difficulty focusing, not listening when spoken to, struggling to follow
instructions; hyperactive symptoms include talking nonstop, fidgeting, not being able to sit still, having
difficulty doing quiet tasks, and having difficulty waiting for things, among others.
2
For example, a Council on Scientific Affairs concluded, “diagnostic criteria for ADHD are based on
extensive empirical research and, if applied appropriately, lead to the diagnosis of a syndrome with high
interrater reliability, good face validity, and high predictability of course and medication responsiveness’ in
1998 (Goldman et al. 1998)

3

2003). However, pharmacotherapy alone has not yet been shown to improve the longterm outcome for any domain of functioning (Goldman et al. 1998). While the explosion
in pharmacological therapy occurred in 1991, as yet there are no studies of the
consequences of long term use (Davey 2006).
Much of the work that has linked childhood ADHD or hyperactivity symptoms to
labor market outcomes has used samples from outside the United States and/or used
aggregated measures of early childhood mental health, such as behavioral problem
indices rather than information on diagnoses. For example, Gregg and Machin (1998)
use the British National Child Development Survey (NCDS) data and find that behavioral
problems at age 7 are related to poorer educational attainment at age 16, which in turn is
associated with poor labor market outcomes at ages 23 and 33. 3 A study of a cohort of
all New Zealand children born between 1971 and 1973 in Dunedin found that those with
behavior problems at age 7 to 9 were more likely to be unemployed at age 15 to 21
(Caspi et al., 1998). 4 Importantly, neither study used specific measures of ADHD and
neither was able to use sibling comparisons, so the relationships could be biased from
neighborhood or family factors.
Other research has focused on educational and other long term consequences of
ADHD, often using sibling fixed effects specifications. Currie and Stabile (2006) was
the first such study, using US and Canadian NLSY data with sibling fixed effects to show
3

The behavioural problems variables were defined from the following eight “syndrome” scores given in
NCDS: unforthcomingness, withdrawal, depression, anxiety, hostility towards adults, anxiety for
acceptance by children, restlessness and “inconsequential” behaviour. They were entered into the empirical
models as 0-1 dummies indicating positive scores on 1, 2/3 and 4 or more of the 8 measures (with no
positive scores being the reference group).
4
Behavior problems were assessed with independent parent and teacher ratings of each child's behavior.
The ratings used items from the "antisocial" and "hyperactivity" subscales of the Rutter Child Scales
(Rutter, Tizard, and Whitmore 1970). Items were scored 0 = does not apply, 1 = applies somewhat, 2 =
certainly applies. The authors combined the parent and teacher ratings into a single score to improve the
reliability and validity of this measure.

associations between behavioral symptoms consistent with ADHD 5 and grade repetition,
test scores, and special education placement. Fletcher and Wolfe (2008) followed this
work using the Add Health data with sibling comparisons to show some associations
between ADHD and later education outcomes, such as high school grade point average.
Additionally, Aizer (2009) shows evidence that ADHD “spills over” on classmate test
score performance in elementary school. Currie and Stabile (2009) extend this work
further by using the Canadian and US NLSY datasets and show that hyperactive
symptoms reported by parents are associated with educational outcomes as well as
delinquency, and Fletcher and Wolfe (2009) show associations between childhood
ADHD symptoms and criminal activities as a young adult using sibling fixed effects
models. While these papers are suggestive that childhood ADHD may also have labor
market implications, they do not provide direct evidence.
The most similar paper to the current study is Currie et al. (2010), who use a
combined ADHD/Conduct disorder category of “externalizing disorders” and show that
this grouping is related to welfare receipt by age 19, grade retention and lower literacy
scores, even using sibling fixed effects; the findings also suggest that later diagnosis may
be associated with worse outcomes. Their data is somewhat limited because it is based
on administrative records from one Canadian province and thus lacks typical social
science measures such as socioeconomic status, etc and does not contain labor market
outcomes. This paper will build from the research base by using national data from the
5

The authors were only able to concentrate on hyperactivity questions from the Behavior Problems Index:
The hyperactivity subscore has 5 questions:
1. He/she has difficulty concentrating, cannot pay attention for long
2. He/she is easily confused, seems to be in a fog
3. He/she is impulsive, acts without thinking
4. He/she has a lot of difficulty getting his/her mind off certain thoughts
(has obsessions)
5. He/she is restless or overly active, cannot sit still.

outcome information as well as histories of ADHD status.

Data and Empirical Methods
The Add Health is a school-based, longitudinal study of the health-related
behaviors of adolescents and their outcomes in young adulthood. Beginning with an inschool questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in
grades 7 through 12 in 1994-95 (Wave 1), the study follows up with a series of in-home
interviews of respondents approximately one year (Wave 2; 1996), six years (Wave 3;
2001-2002), and thirteen years later (Wave 4; 2008). By design, the Add Health survey
included a sample stratified by region, urbanicity, school type, ethnic mix, and size. 6
While the original wave 1 sample collected information on over 20,000
respondents, approximately 15,000 were followed longitudinally at wave 4. At the same
time, the data contain a sub-sample of siblings who have been followed over time; this
sample originally numbered approximately 5,400, over half of whom were followed
(along with their co-sibling) longitudinally into wave 4, leaving a sample size for the
sibling analyses of nearly 3,500. 7 In order to maximize available sample sizes for the
analysis, missing family income during high school and maternal education was imputed
and a dummy variable is controlled. Likewise, in some of the auxiliary regressions,

6

See Udry 2003 for full description of the Add Health data set. The sample may not be representative of
the more general population in that it is a school-based survey and as such, those individuals originally
interviewed at grade 12 in Wave 1 will be very likely to graduate high school. Grade level at Wave 1 is
controlled to reduce this issue.
7
The reason sample attrition appears more pronounced in the sibling sub-sample than the main sample is
that if either sibling is missing at follow-up, both siblings are dropped from the sample.

6

missing birth weight and childhood mistreatment information is imputed in order to retain
sample size.
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the analysis sample. 8 The earnings data
from wave 4 come from the following question and are interval coded 9: “Now think
about your personal earnings. How much income did you receive from personal earnings
before taxes—that is, wages.” 10 Using this coding procedure, the average earnings for
this sample of adults (average age nearly 30) is nearly $35,000. Separately from the
earnings question, individuals are also asked to report whether they worked ten or more
hours during the previous week, which is the measure of employment available in this
study. In additional analysis, I also examine receipt of public assistance, which includes
welfare payments and food stamps.
In order to characterize ADHD, this paper uses two measures asked at Wave 4:
(1) “Has a doctor, or nurse, or other health care provider ever told you that you have or
had attention problems or ADD or ADHD?” and (2) “How old were you when the doctor,
nurse, or other health practitioner first told you?” In order to separate “early” and “late”
ADHD, I split the sample by the median age of diagnosis (age 12) reported in the
sample. 11 While recall bias could be an issue with these measures, the 5% of the sample

8

Like Currie and Stabile (2006), who use sibling comparisons with other datasets, there is very little
difference across sub-samples. Fletcher and Wolfe (2008) also do not find large differences between the
full sample and sibling samples using the Add Health data. See Appendix Table 1A.
9
The midpoint of each interval is used in the analysis. The intervals include: $0, <$5,000, $5,000-9,999,
10,000-14,999, 15,000-19,999, 20,000-24,999, 25,000-29,999, 30,000-39,999, 40,000-49,999, 50,00074,999, 75,000-99,999, 100,000-149,999, 150,000 or more.
10
The interval coding does not allow an adequate examination using quantile regression specification,
though Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok (2003) use interval-coded earnings data with 23 intervals and assign the
midpoint.
11
Interestingly, there appears to be no pronounced “clumping” of the age of diagnosis measure in the
sample, say at ages 5 and 10.

who reported a diagnosis of ADHD matches closely with the estimated prevalence of the
illness. 12
The data also contains rich information on health conditions and (endogenous)
health behaviors. Individuals report behaviors at wave 1 such as tobacco use (25%),
sexual activity (39%), alcohol use (41%), obese status (7%), and marijuana use (14%) as
well as completed a diagnostic tool for depression (8%) at wave 1 of the survey (during
junior high or high school). In Wave 4 of the survey, respondents report whether they
have ever been diagnosed with asthma (15%) or diabetes (3%), and in Wave 3 the
respondents completed an assessment of childhood mistreatment which is combined into
a “mistreatment index” using principal component analysis. 13 Finally, in order to control
for skill accumulation (apart from years of schooling information), the analysis uses
scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), which was administered at
waves 1 and 3. 14
In Table 2, descriptive statistics are presented based on ADHD status. The
differences foreshadow both some of the results in the paper and empirical issues with
comparing individuals with ADHD vs. individuals without a diagnosis. There are large
differences in employment outcomes between individuals with an ADHD diagnosis and

12

Appendix Table 2A compares the prevalence rate for Add Health with surveyed children from the NHIS
2009 survey. Overall, the rates are similar, however because these are different cohorts of individuals, and
the prevalence rates have risen over time, it is not surprising that the NHIS rates are higher. Also of note is
that the differences in rates for blacks between the two samples are larger than those of the other groups. It
could be that reports of ADHD may be differentially stigmatized by race and this stigma could be falling
over time. This difference should be considered when viewing the results in this paper.

The Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT) is a computerized, abridged version of the Peabody

persons aged 2 1/2 to 40 years old who can see and hear reasonably well and who understand standard
English to some degree. The test scores are standardized by age. Some psychologists interpret PVT scores
as a measure of verbal IQ. Information on the test is provided online at

those with no diagnosis. Individuals with ADHD are 9 percentage points less likely to be
currently working and earn incomes that are $4,000 less than those with no ADHD
diagnosis. Individual with ADHD are also 10 percentage points more likely to receive
public assistance. However, there are also differences in the family background of
individuals with ADHD. On one hand, these individuals come from more advantaged
backgrounds, as measured by maternal education and family income. On the other hand,
individuals with ADHD are also more likely to have other health problems, such as
asthma, and are also more likely to be exposed to childhood mistreatment. These
differences in family background as well as unobserved family factors will be controlled
in the analysis. Individuals with ADHD also have several co-occurring illnesses and
unhealthy behaviors—they are more likely to smoke marijuana and tobacco, drink
alcohol, and be sexually active (p-value<0.16). The empirical analysis will be able to
control for these important sources of heterogeneity.

Empirical Models
Following much of the literature examining the associations between health and
labor market outcomes, I begin the analysis using baseline OLS regression specifications:

Employment i ,t = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + X i β 2 + ε it

(1)

Likewise, traditional Mincer models are used to link log(earnings) with ADHD and other
individual and family-level characteristics ( X ) (following Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok
2003, among others in examinations of the labor market effects of poor mental health):
log(earnings ) i ,t = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + X i β 2 + ε it

(2)

where outcomes are measured at time t (wave 4) and ADHD is reported for age of

9

diagnosis prior to wave 4. This temporal structure reduces concerns with reverse
causality in the estimated effects. In order to examine the potential biases from either
community (c) or family (f) level unobserved heterogeneity, the empirical models are
expanded to allow for school-of- origin fixed effects or family fixed effects for each
outcome, Yi (employment, earnings, and public assistance receipt):

Yict = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + X i β 2 + τ c + ε ict

(3)

Yift = β 0 + β 1 ADHDit −1 + Z i β 2 + µ f + ε ift

(4)

where the Z vector in equation (4) is limited to individual level variables that vary within
families (e.g. gender). Estimates from equation (3) will allow common environmental
factors at the school/neighborhood level to be controlled, such as labor market
opportunities, health care options, and other factors. Then, in order to further control for
family-level factors that could affect both labor market opportunities and health status
(e.g. parental health), family fixed effects will be controlled. A comparison of (2) and (4)
will indicate whether baseline methods are driven by omitted variable bias at the family
level (Currie and Stabile, 2006; Fletcher and Wolfe, 2008). 15 Further examinations will
include additional individual level variables, including educational outcomes and cooccurring illnesses and health behaviors to further examine potential pathways linking
ADHD and labor market outcomes as well as reduce the chances of bias due to
individual-level heterogeneity. In addition to these measures, auxiliary specifications
were estimated that included measures of hours worked per week as well as criminal

15

It is important to note that if the ADHD diagnosis is measured with error, the use of sibling fixed effects
may exacerbate the bias associated with the measurement error. In addition spillover effects between
siblings would bias downward the estimated differences in outcomes (Fletcher and Wolfe 2008).

activities; neither set of measures changed the main results presented below and are
available upon request.

Results
Results for Employment
Table 3 presents baseline OLS estimates of the effects of childhood ADHD on
employment at Wave 4. Column 1 shows evidence that ADHD is associated with a 10
percentage point decrease in employment. Separating the results by gender (columns 2
and 3) suggest no differences. Separating the results by race suggests that blacks (14
points) and Hispanics (17 points) are affected to a greater extent than whites (9.5 points).
Columns 7 and 8 show that the effect is more heavily concentrated in children
from poor (below median income) families (13 points) in comparison to children from
rich (above median income) families (4.5 points). 16 These differences by income also
occur in the other outcomes discussed below. There are many potential reasons for these
differences by family income, but data limitations (e.g. a single year of income data)
preclude a fuller examination. It is possible that children in poorer households are less
likely to receive medical (or other) treatment than those in richer households, however,
Ritalin and other drugs now prescribed for ADHD symptoms were not widely available
in the mid 1980s when the respondents were children (Woodworth 2000). More
generally, though, differences in access to health care based on family income might
produce differences in effects of childhood health. A second possibility is that,
conditional on receiving a diagnosis, children in poor households had worse symptoms
on average. In results not reported, I find no correlation between family income and

Controlling for birth order did not change any results and was not statistically significant.

ADHD symptoms for those who are ever diagnosed. Additional analysis with data that
has information on a wider set of potential mechanisms is needed to probe these results
further.
In order to control for measures of environmental factors (e.g. local
unemployment rates) during adolescence as well as narrow the comparison groups,
controls were included for high school of origin fixed effects in column 2 in Table 4;
however these controls do not alter the estimates from column 1. Column 3 shows the
baseline results for the sibling subsample and column 4 controls for high school fixed
effects, again suggesting no changes in the coefficients. Next, family fixed effects are
controlled in column 5, which slightly reduces the effect on employment to 12.6
percentage points. In order to examine potential pathways through which ADHD might
affect employment, columns 6-8 add controls for health behaviors (6), years of schooling
and wave 3 test scores (7), and occupation fixed effects at wave 3 (8)—the results are
surprisingly stable 17, indicating between a 12-14 percentage point reduction in
employment for individuals with ADHD, compared with their sibling. As noted above,
these results are unchanged if controls for wave 3 criminal behavior or hours worked are
used. Overall, the effects of ADHD on adult employment appear concentrated in
disadvantaged children, are only partially explained by education and health behaviors,
and the magnitude of the coefficient is quite robust to controls for several sources of
heterogeneity.

Results for Earnings

17

All individuals with no stated occupation at wave 3 are given a separate (common) value for their
occupation code for this analysis.

12

Results for log(earnings) are presented in Tables 5 and 6. It is important to note
that these empirical models are conditional on non-zero earnings. 18 Baseline OLS results
in column 1 of Table 5 indicate a nearly 30% earnings reduction for those with childhood
ADHD. The magnitude is nearly twice the black-white earnings gap and similar to the
gender gap. Splitting the sample by gender in columns 2 and 3 shows very little
difference in effects. As before, the earnings effects of ADHD are also concentrated
among racial minorities and children from poor families.
Again, in order to control for measures of environmental factors during
adolescence as well as narrow the comparison groups, controls were included for high
school of origin fixed effects in column 2 in Table 6; however these controls do not alter
the estimates from column 1. Column 3 shows the baseline results for the sibling
subsample and column 4 controls for high school fixed effects, again suggesting no
changes in the coefficients. Next, family fixed effects are controlled in column 5, which
slightly increases the effect on earnings to 40% from 36% (Smith 2009 shows larger
effects of poor childhood health on income after using family fixed effects). In order to
examine potential pathways through which ADHD might affect earnings, columns 6-8
add controls for health behaviors (6), years of schooling and wave 3 test scores (7), and
occupation fixed effects at wave 3 (8)—the results are again surprisingly stable,
indicating between a 34-36% reduction in earnings for individuals with ADHD,
compared with their sibling. Overall, like employment, the effects of ADHD on adult
earnings appear concentrated in disadvantaged children, are only partially explained by

18

Results imputing zero earnings for individuals with missing earnings are larger than those presented and
are available upon request.

13

education and health behaviors, and the magnitude of the coefficient is quite robust to
controls for several sources of heterogeneity.

Results for Public Assistance
Results for public assistance receipt between waves 3 and 4 are presented in
Tables 7 and 8. Baseline OLS results in column 1 of Table 7 indicate a 13 percentage
point increase in public assistance for those with childhood ADHD. Splitting the sample
by gender in columns 2 and 3 shows larger effects for females (16 points) than males (11
points). As before, the effects of ADHD are also concentrated among racial minorities
and children from poor families (15 points) versus children from rich families (8 points).
Again, in order to control for measures of environmental factors (e.g. local
unemployment rates) during adolescence as well as narrow the comparison groups,
controls were included for high school of origin fixed effects in column 2 in Table 8;
however these controls do not alter the estimates from column 1. Column 3 shows the
baseline results for the sibling subsample and column 4 controls for high school fixed
effects, again suggesting no changes in the coefficients. Next, family fixed effects are
controlled in column 5, which slightly reduces the effect on public assistance from 19
points to 17 points. In order to examine potential pathways through which ADHD might
affect earnings, columns 6-8 add controls for health behaviors (6), years of schooling and
wave 3 test scores (7), and occupation fixed effects at wave 3 (8)—the results are again
surprisingly stable, indicating between a 15-17 point reduction in social assistance for
individuals with ADHD, compared with their sibling. Overall, like employment, the
effects of ADHD on adult social assistance appear concentrated in disadvantaged

14

children, are only partially explained by education and health behaviors, and the
magnitude of the coefficient is quite robust to controls for several sources of
heterogeneity.

Examination by Age of Onset
Tables 9-11 examine the differential effects based on whether the respondent
reported an “early” or “late” diagnosis 19, where the variables are defined based on the
median age of reported diagnosis in the sample—age 12. Table 9 shows evidence that
early ADHD reduces employment by 12-15 percentage points and that late ADHD
reduces employment by approximately 5 percentage points.
Table 10 shows evidence that early ADHD reduces earnings by 35-45% and late
ADHD reduces earnings by 15-25% compared to individuals with no diagnosis, and the
results are relatively robust to family fixed effects and additional controls. Finally, Table
11 shows that early ADHD increases social assistance receipt by 15-20 percentage points
and late ADHD increases social assistance by 8-14 points in young adulthood. Again, the
results are relatively robust to family fixed effects and controls for individual
heterogeneity. A potential explanation for these patterns of effects is that ADHD cases
that are diagnosed early are more severe in nature, thus prompting action by the school
system or parents. These results are also consistent with Currie et al. (2010) and suggest
that early interventions that are able to reduce ADHD symptoms may be particularly
compelling.

Suggestive Robustness Check on Retrospective Reporting
19

It is worthwhile to again note that age of diagnosis will occur later than age of onset.

15

One final issue that requires additional examination is whether individual
retrospective reports on ADHD diagnosis may be clouded by “rationalization bias”
(Benitez-Silva et al. 1999), where because they have experienced trouble in the labor
market they misreport positive prior ADHD diagnosis as a way to rationalize their
outcomes. Because the ADHD diagnosis and labor market data are collected
contemporaneously, this potential reverse causality issue needs to be addressed. Thus, I
substitute the ADHD diagnosis measure from Wave 4 with a Wave 1 (occurring 15 years
prior) self report of the frequency with which the respondent had trouble paying attention
in school (never, just a few times, once a week, almost everyday, and everyday). Results
are reported in Table 12 and suggest nearly identical patterns in comparison to results
presented for ADHD diagnosis. For example, individuals reporting attention troubles
“everyday” are 8 percentage points less likely to be employed at Wave 4, face earnings
reductions of approximately 30%, and are 10 percentage points more likely to participate
in a social program. These results are robust to family fixed effects controls. While this
measure may not be precisely the same as ADHD symptoms 20, it does suggest that
retrospective reports of ADHD diagnosis are not clouded by reverse causality concerns.

Conclusions
This paper provides the first evidence in the literature that childhood ADHD
diagnosis decreases young adult employment and earnings and provides corroborative
evidence that ADHD increases the likelihood of social assistance (Currie et al. 2010).

20

Appendix Table A3 shows that the Wave 1 attention measure strongly predicts later ADHD diagnosis.
I also analyzed the inclusion of these Wave 1 attention measures as instruments for ADHD diagnoses in
unreported results. The results typically increased by a factor of 4-10, though the excludability of these
potential instruments was questionable, suggesting these results are biased upward.

16

This evidence advances previous literature because it is less susceptible to issues of
reverse causality and also allows controls for unobserved heterogeneity at the
environmental and family levels as well as many measures of co-occurring health
outcomes and behaviors. Overall, the magnitude of the results are robust across
specifications and suggest that childhood ADHD reduces adult employment by
approximately 10 percentage points, reduces earnings by 33 percent and increases social
assistance receipt by 15 points. Further, the employment reductions appear to be
concentrated among children from disadvantaged families. The Add Health data does not
contain information on potential ADHD treatment during childhood; a reasonable
speculation might therefore place the results in this paper as lower bound estimates if
some individuals were diagnosed and successfully treated 21.
To place the magnitude of the results into perspective, the 30% earnings reduction
associated with ADHD are as large as the within-sample, within-family gender earnings
gap (29%), the within-sample black-white earning gap (24%), the within sample, within
family earnings difference for those who report graduating college versus those who did
not (15%) and larger than the effects of low birth weight (table not shown but available
upon request). Broadening the comparison, Leigh and Gill (1997) present evidence of an
8-10 percent earnings premium associated with community college completion. Currie
and Hyson (1999) report wage reductions of between 2-4 percent associated with low
birth weight status. Fletcher (2009a) finds a 15% earnings reduction associated with
adolescent onset depression. Smith (2009) finds a 24% increase in household income for
siblings reporting good or excellent physical health up to age 16.

21

Note also, though, that many common pharmaceutical treatments were not widely available during the
late 1980s and early 1990s, when the respondents were children and adolescents (Woodworth 2000).

17

Compared to these similar findings from related work, the associations between
childhood ADHD and adult outcomes are very large in magnitude. There are several
potential explanations of these effect sizes, but it should also be noted that additional
research is needed to replicate them in other settings before strong conclusions can be
reached. One potential partial explanation is that, in this cohort, rates of modern
treatment were likely quite low. As discussed previously, the cohorts under study grew
up at a time with much less access to ADHD treatments than presently available. As one
example, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) actively blocked the use of
methylphenidate (Ritalin) and similar drugs by classifying it as a Schedule II controlled
substance since 1971—prior to 1991 the sale of these drugs were stable and small.
However, by 1999 they had increased by almost 500% (Woodworth, 2000). The
respondents in Add Health were teenagers and young adults by 1999 (the typical age of
onset of ADHD symptoms is 7). As discussed above, childhood ADHD also persists in a
large proportion of individuals into adulthood (60%), whereas, for example, the effects of
low birth weight may be less problematic for adults (Fletcher 2011). However, again,
readers should be exercise caution in viewing results of this magnitude because they have
not been replicated yet and are so large.
If the results are confirmed in other studies, the within-sibling associations
between earnings and childhood ADHD diagnosis are worthy of addition attention. The
results could be relevant along several dimensions. First, the results suggest that
childhood ADHD may be an important determinant of labor market outcomes, with
potentially important differences in effects by family background. Increasing our
understanding of labor market outcomes may allow additional policies to be suggested to

18

increase labor force participation and productivity, which could have long term
implications for important life outcomes such as income and wealth accumulation,
occupation, and adult population health. Second, the results suggest that interventions
that successfully reduce ADHD symptoms during childhood may have downstream
benefits that may not be comprehensively measured in many cost-benefit analyses and
suggest that further interventions may be desirable. Increases in treatment options,
particularly during early childhood, may provide substantial long term benefits in terms
of future labor productivity.
