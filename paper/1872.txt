Optimal Tariffs in Consistent Conjectural Variations Equilibrium

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the determination of the optimal tariff under the

assumption of Consistent Conjectural Variations (CCV). A general characterization of the CCV equilibrium is given. We show that (i) there are, in
general, a multiplicity of such equilibria, and (ii) under certain restrictions, the Cournot equilibrium, which is based on the assumption of no retal-

iation can also be a CCV equilibrium. By contrast, free trade is never a CCV
equilibrium. Finally the CCV equilibrium is solved explicitly in a simple
example.

1. INTRODUCTION
Until recently, the theory of optimal tariffs has been based on the assumption that neither country will retaliate to the imposition of the tariff by its

trading partner.!" The existence of tariff wars, however, calls into serious

question the realism of this assumption. This shortcoming is recognized in a
recent paper by Thursby and Jensen (1983), which analyzes the question of optimal tariffs on the assumption of some constant conjectured form of retalia-

tion by each country.V
In this paper, we determine the optimal tariff under the assumption of

consistent conjectural variations (CCV). That is, we assume that each country's conjecture about the retaliation by its trading partner is in fact con-

sistent with that country's reaction curve. This form of equilibrium is
appealing and has been introduced into oligopolistic models by a number of
authors; see, e.g., Laitner (1980), Bresnahan (1981), Perry (1982), Kamien and

Schwartz (1983), Eaton and Grossman (forthcoming). It has also been applied
to the determination of tariff equilibrium by Jensen and Thurshy (1984).
But despite its appeal and widespread adoption in the literature, the conjectural variations equilibrium is often criticized as not being a proper game—

theoretic construct. The essence of this objection is that in a static game
there is no possibility for action and policy reaction and hence there is no
way an agent can conjecture, let alone correctly conjecture, his rival's re-

sponse. One justification for the Consistent Conjectural Variations equilibrium in this circumstance is as a shorthand 'reduced form' for a fully dynamic

repeated game. Also, Bresnahan (1981) justifies it in terms of comparative
static responses in a situation where exogenous shocks occur with sufficient
frequency for each decision maker to observe and to learn his rival's true

—2—

response. However, the dynamic process by which these consistent conlectures
are generated is an unsolved problem.-1
As we shall see in the course of the analysis below, the determination of
the CCV equilibrium involves inherent nonlinearities and all we are able to

establish is consistency to the first order of approximation. We give a general characterization of the CCV equilibrium for the optimal tariffs. We show
that:

(1)

there are, in general, a multiplicity of such eciullibria, and

(ii) under certain restrictions, the Cournot equilibrium, which is based on

the assumption of no retaliation, can also he a CCV equilibrium. By contrast,
free trade is never a CCV equilibrium. Finally, we solve for the CCV equilibrium explicitly in a simple example.

2 DETERMINATION OF EQUILIBRIUM WITH CONSISTENT CONJECTURES

A. Framework
We consider the usual two country, two good trade model, where both coun-

tries are competitive and the only distortions are import tariffs.' We index
the countries by A, B, the goods by x, y, and assume without loss of generality that Country B imports good x in return for good y which it exports to

Country A. The tariffs levied by Countries A, B, are t, t, respectively,
and the two governments are assumed to redistribute the tariff revenues to
their citizens.

The basic model is described by the following set of equations:

U1 =

U'(C',C1)

p =

q =

Equations (1) define the utility functions in Countries A, B to be func-

tions of the respective consumptions of the two goods. The functions U are
assumed to be continuous, twice differentiable, and quasi—concave. Equations
(2) define the optimality conditions for consumers in each country. Equations
(3) and (4) apply analogously to production. Equation (3) defines the
production possibility curve, which is assumed to be concave, while (4)

specifies the usual marginal product conditions for optimality. Equations (5)
define excess demand as the difference between consumption and production.

For the import good E > 0, while for the export good E < 0.'
Equations (6) describe the balance of trade equilibrium for the two countries, while (7) specifies market clearance in the world markets for the two

—4—

goods. With no transport costs and in the absence of frictions, (8) specifies
the relationship between the relative prices of the two goods in the two

economies and the tariffs being levied. Using this relationship, it is clear
from (6), (7) that the goods markets are not both independent; equilibrium in
one implies equilibrium in the other, so that one equation, say (7b), can be
dropped.

B. Determination of Optimal Tariff with Conle.ctured Variations

Consider first Country A. Using (5), (6), (7b), its utility function may
he expressed in the form

there is no CCV solution.—

3. CHARACTERIZATION OF CCV EQUILIBRIUM

-

Equations (16) give general characterizations of the CCV equilibrium. The
following propositions can be established and are proved in the Appendix.

—8—

Proposition

1: A Cournot equilibrium is CCV if and only if

the elasticity of each country's offer curve is independent
9/

of the other country s tariff.—

In their analysis of conjectural variation, Thursby and Jensen (1983) have
shown that under certain conditions, free trade may emerge as a special case
of their conjectured tariff equilibrium. By contrast, we can show:.!.-"

Proposition 2: Free trade is never a CCV equilibrium.

4. CONSTANT ELASTICITY OFFER CURVES
The expressions for the optimal tariffs under CCV, embodied in (15), (16)

are extremely complicated to determine. In this section we consider the case

where all elasticities 8q' 8, c, , are constant. Eliminating cA, B' under
these conditions, the solutions in (16) simplify to the following pair of
equations in T , T

(17a) defines the reaction curve for Country A, correctly taking

account of the reaction function of Country B. Likewise, (17b) does the sane
for Country B. The pair of equations may therefore he termed as being "gen—
eralized" reaction functions. Because of the interactions they embody, both
of these equatioiis are highly nonlinear, raising the possibility of a multi-

plicity of solutions. Note that

satisfy the two equations. This verifies Proposition 2, that with offer
curves having constant elasticities, the Cournot solution is also a CCV solu—

tion. But there are other solutions as well.
In order to study (l7a), (17b) further, and to obtain an explicit solution,
we shall consider the case where not only all elasticities are constant, but
also both countries are symmetric with

ap =—f3
a, a

q
y
Given the symmetry it is clear that the solutions to

obtained at the

intersection of the reaction functions (17a), (17b) must imply t

which can be verified directly. Thus setting T =

T,

a fact

simplifying the common CCV tariffs are obtained as the solutions to the equation

Thus, in general, there are three CCV equilibria, one of which is t =

These solutions may be ranked over varying values of the elasticity a.

First, in order for the Marshall—Lerner condition to hold a > 1/2. Secondly,
for the range 1/2 < a < 1, both t (Cournot) and t3 imply corresponding values

T, t3 < 0. That is, the price of the imported good in each country is negative,

—10—

which is obviously infeasible. Hence, for 1/2 < a < 1 there is a unique
feasible CCV solution, namely

CONCLUSIONS

This paper has determined the optimal tariff under the assumption that

each country correctly anticipates the response by its rival. We have given
both a general characterization of this CCV equilibrium and considered a

specific example. In general, there are a multiplicity of CCV equilibrium
tariffs. Under certain restrictions one of these may be the Cournot equilibrium, which (in this case correctly) assumes no retaliation. But free trade
is never such an equilibrium outcome.

helpful discussions on the game—theoretic underpinnings of the Consistent
Conjectural Variations equilibrium.

i"The notion of consistent conjectural variations equilibrium has been.
refined recently by Basar (1986) who defines CCV equilibria of different
orders. He shows that when appropriately defined, the CCV can indeed he a
legitimate equilibrium concept. According to this classification, the Cournot
equilibrium is a zero'th order CCV equilibrium. The usual definition, and the
one we shall consider here, is a first order CCV equilibrium, in which the
players correctly conjecture on the slopes (first derivatives) of the reaction
functions. More generally in a CCV equilibrium of the n'th order, the rivals
correctly conjecture on the first n derivatives of the rival's reaction function.

(1982) show how free trade may result from a cooperative equilibrium.
