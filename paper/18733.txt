ABSTRACT
In this paper and the associated online database, we provide new data and measures of bank regulatory
and supervisory policies in 180 countries from 1999 to 2011. The data include and the measures are
based upon responses to hundreds of questions, including information on permissible bank activities,
capital requirements, the powers of official supervisory agencies, information disclosure requirements,
external governance mechanisms, deposit insurance, barriers to entry, and loan provisioning. The dataset
also provides information on the organization of regulatory agencies and the size, structure, and performance
of banking systems. Since the underlying surveys are large and complex, we construct summary indices
of key bank regulatory and supervisory policies to facilitate cross-country comparisons and analyses
of changes in banking policies over time.

I. Introduction
Motivating an investigation of bank regulation and supervision is easy. One can point to
the global banking crisis of 2007-2009, the banking problems still plaguing many European
countries in 2013, and the more than 100 systemic banking crises that have devastated
economies around the world since 1970. All these crises reflect, at least partially, defects in bank
regulation and supervision.1 One can also point to research showing that banks matter for human
welfare beyond periodic crises. Banks influence economic growth, poverty, entrepreneurship,
labor market conditions, and the economic opportunities available to people.2 Thus, examining
the type and impact of bank regulatory and supervisory policies in countries is a critical area of
inquiry.
The problem, however, is that measuring bank regulation and supervision around the
world is hard. Hundreds of laws and regulations, emanating from different parts of national and
local governments, define policies regarding bank capital standards, the entry requirements of
new domestic and foreign banks, bank ownership restrictions, and loan provisioning guidelines.
Numerous pages of regulations in most countries delineate the permitted activities of banks and
provide shape and substance to deposit insurance schemes and the nature and timing of the
information that banks must disclose to regulators and the public. And, extensive statutes define
the powers of regulatory and supervisory officials over banks — and the limits of those powers.
There are daunting challenges associated with acquiring data on all of the laws, regulations, and
practices that apply to banks in countries and then aggregating this information into useful
statistics that capture different and important aspects of regulatory regimes. This helps explain
why the systematic collection of data on bank regulatory and supervisory policies is only in its

nascent stages. Yet, without sound measures of banking policies across countries and over time,
researchers will be correspondingly constrained in assessing which policies work best to promote
well-functioning banking systems, and in proposing socially beneficial reforms to banking
policies in need of improvement.
In this paper, we offer a new database on bank regulation and supervision for more than
180 countries, covering the period from 1999 through 2011. Although we do not assess the
impact of banking sector policies on banks or the broader economy, we do seek to contribute to
research on the design and implementation of policies by providing useful measures of bank
regulation and supervision. As reportedly argued by the great scientist Lord Kelvin in the 19th
century, “[I]f you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.”3
Our database builds on four surveys sponsored by the World Bank. About sixteen years
ago, the World Bank asked us to assemble the first cross-country database on bank regulation
and supervision. With guidance a n d h e l p from bank supervisors, financial economists, and
World Bank staff, we developed and implemented an extensive survey. 4 We had bank
regulatory officials complete the survey—and often had several officials from the same
country complete the survey in order to verify the consistency of responses. Survey I
covered 118 countries, included over 300 questions, and was mostly completed in
1999. 5 For the second survey, we extended and revised the questionnaire based on input
from World Bank staff, country officials, and academics. The World Bank released
Survey II in 2003, which provides information on bank regulatory and supervisory
policies in 2002. Survey II includes information from 151 counties covering over 400
questions. Survey III was posted on the World Bank’s website in the summer of 2007,

We sometimes use the term “regulation” to describe a wide-array of banking policies and compliance mechanisms.

The responses to the survey were received in 1998 through 2000, but the majority of the answers refer to policies

and it provides information on banking policies in 2006 for 142 countries. In these first
three surveys, we were extensively involved in writing the questionnaire, implementing
the survey, and assembling the data. For Survey IV, we played a less prominent role in
managing the survey. 6 Specifically, we helped the World Bank conduct a major revision
of the questionnaire, but we did not implement the survey. Released in 2012, Survey IV
provides information on banking policies in 125 countries for 2011. Overall, the
surveys cover 180 countries, although the number varies from one survey to the next as
already indicated.
The dataset that we make available online differs from the survey responses
posted by the World Bank in two key regards. 7 First, we devote considerable effort to
identifying and resolving inconsistencies and missing values by reviewing each of the
four surveys individually and by considering the time-series of answers for each
country. For example, there are cases when a country provides the same information
about a technical regulatory rule in Surveys I, II, and IV, but provides a different
answer for Survey III, or a country provides the same answers in Surveys I, III, and IV,
but gives a different response for Survey II. In such cases, we examine country
documents and websites to assess whether there is any reason for such odd changes and
reversals in policies to assess whether this represents a coding mistake or an actual
change in policy. As another example, for each missing data entry, we reviewed
6

More specifically, the survey was coordinated by the World Bank's María Soledad Martínez Pería and Martin
Cihak, with input from numerous bank regulation experts both inside and outside the World Bank. PKF (U.K.) and
Auxilium helped with compiling and following up on the survey responses. The survey was financed in part with
support from the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID).

national publications and contacted national regulatory officials in an effort to complete
the dataset to a greater degree. Although we are certain that the resultant dataset is less
than perfect, we believe this review process has yielded a more comprehensive and
accurate set of data.
The second, and perhaps more important, dimension along which our data differs
from the survey responses posted by the World Bank involves the construction of
indexes. For each of the four surveys, we provide summary indexes of major categories
of bank regulatory and supervisory policies. This is crucial because of the size of the
surveys. There are hundreds of questions in each survey, many with sub-questions and
sub-components of those sub-questions. As a result, there are limitations to formulating
sound impressions about either cross-country differences in policies or cross-time
changes in policies from the raw survey data. Consequently, besides providing the
answers to all the individual survey questions, we aggregate the responses to individual
questions into indexes that summarize notable aspects of bank regulation and
supervision. We construct indexes of policies on capital, ownership, the activities of
banks, the entry of new banks, the powers of supervisors, the ability of private investors
to monitor bank behavior and to govern banks, deposit insurance features, loan
classification and provisioning practices, and many other areas of bank regulation and
supervision. The result of this effort is the construction of more than 50 indexes. We
provide a detailed description of the construction of the indexes in the online dataset.
The dataset also provides information on the organization of regulatory agencies
and the size and structure of the overall banking system. We document whether there is
a single regulator or multiple regulators and whether countries authorize their central
banks to play a key role in bank supervision. We also document the size of each

5
country’s banking system, the concentration of the system, and the role of government
owned and foreign owned banks and how these characteristics have changed over time.
The dataset, therefore, facilitates analyses of the relationships among the organization
of national banking authorities, the details of financial regulation and supervision, and
the size and structure of the banking system. Moreover, researchers can easily combine
these data with other datasets to explore the factors that explain banking sector policies,
and the consequences of those policies for a variety of outcomes.
Besides describing the data, this paper provides a wealth of cross-country and
cross-time comparisons. We analyze changes in bank regulatory and supervisory
practices over time, examine the degree to which banking policies have converged
across countries, and document how the organization of bank regulatory authorities and
the size and structure of the banking system differ around the world. Although there is
some convergence along some dimensions of bank regulation, there remains substantial
heterogeneity in policies, organization, and structure.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an
overview of the survey. Section III discusses the indices of bank regulatory and
supervisory policies regarding permissible bank activities, capital requirements , the
powers of the official supervisory entities, transparency, private monitoring, and
external governance of banks, deposit insurance schemes, barriers to entry, loan
provisioning. Section III also examines the extent to which bank regulations and
supervisory practices have been converging across countries during the tumultuous
period since 1999. Section IV concludes.

II. An Overview of the Survey Data

6
The extensive database on bank regulation and supervision (presented in the online
dataset http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ross_levine/Regulation.htm) is based on four surveys
conducted by the World Bank. Appendix table 1 contains the entire list of questions from Survey
IV, while the online dataset contains the questions for each of the four surveys. As noted above,
the surveys pose questions on a wide array of bank regulatory and supervisory policies. These
include: entry into commercial banking, ownership of bank restrictions, capital standards,
allowable activities for banks, external auditing requirements, governance of banks, liquidity and
diversification requirements, deposit protection schemes, asset classification and provisioning
practices, accounting and information disclosure requirements, supervisory powers associated for
dealing with banks in financial duress, and the structure, mandate, staffing, and procedures of
supervisory agencies. In addition, some information is available on the characteristics of banking
systems, and Survey IV obtains new information on efforts designed to enable regulators to
better address issues of systemic risk and consumer protection regulations in banking.
The surveys cover a broad cross-section of countries. Figure 1 illustrates the countries
that responded to the various surveys, and Appendix table 2 provides detailed information on
those that responded to each of the surveys. Appendix table 3 lists the countries that responded to
Survey IV, sorting them by region and per capita GDP levels. It is clear that coverage is fairly
good, with countries represented from all parts of the world and all levels of income. The fewest
number of countries responding are in the lower income category with small populations. For the
four surveys, 118 countries responded to Survey I, 151 countries responded to Survey II and 143
countries responded to both Surveys III and IV. Of these countries, 73 of them responded to all
four surveys. Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2001, 2006, and 2008) assess the results of Survey I
through III, while Martinez-Peria and Cihak (2012) discuss some of the data from Survey IV.

7
Before defining and reviewing the bank regulation and supervision data, we begin in
Table 1 by documenting cross-country differences in key banking system indicators, using
Survey IV for illustrative purposes. As shown, Table 1 provides information on banking system
size, the number of banks, the proportion of banking assets in government owned banks (where a
bank is considered government owned if 50 percent or more of the shares are controlled by the
government), the proportion of banking assets in foreign owned banks, the number of official
bank supervisors per bank in the country, and the percent of the ten largest banks in a country
that are rated by one of the major international ratings agencies.
For many of the banking system indicators depicted in Table 1, the range of variation is
impressive. Some examples will illustrate this point. Luxemburg has the highest ratio of bank
assets-to-GDP at a striking 1,942 percent, while Iraq has the lowest ratio at 18 percent.8 These
figures are not surprising given that Luxemburg is a very small country with internationally
active banks, whereas Iraq is still recovering from a recent war. The share of bank assets that is
foreign owned ranges from a high of 100 percent in several offshore financial centers to 0
percent in Ethiopia. In the case of government ownership of bank assets, the share ranges from 0
percent for several countries to 74 percent in India (China did not respond to this question, but
available information indicates the figure exceeds 90 percent. In the 2007 survey China did
respond and reported the share was slightly less than 70 percent, but this only captured the four
big state owned banks. The figure exceeds 90 percent even earlier if one includes all state or
government owned banks). Banking density also seems to vary to an astonishing degree, though
much less so once one removes offshore banking centers, such as the Cayman Islands, the Isle of
8

One problem that arises when comparing bank assets across countries is that different countries may use different
accounting standards. As appendix table 7 shows, most countries use International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), while only 6 use U.S. GAAP. When one converts U.S. bank assets from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, total bank
assets increase by roughly $5 trillion in 2012, which is largely due to measuring derivatives on a gross rather than
net basis (see Barth and Prabha, 2012). The biggest effect that different accounting standards will have in measuring
a country’s bank assets is likely to be in the United States, and even then concentrated at the biggest banks, which
account for the bulk of all derivatives.

8
Man, and Seychelles. The median number of banks per 100,000 people is 0.4, with the lowest
figure being 0.01 for India. Large banks control a substantial share of bank assets, with the
median share of the top five banks being 73 percent, and yet although most or all big banks are
audited by international (so it is hoped, more arms-length) firms, in a distressing number of cases
no large banks are so audited, such as in Botswana and Iceland.
Besides providing a snapshot of the structure of banking systems in 2011, the data also
illustrate the evolution of banking systems since 1999. As shown in Figure 2, many countries
have experienced rapid growth in the ratio of bank assets to GDP from Survey I (1999) to Survey
IV (2011). Figure 2 provides information on all countries for which there are data for both
Surveys I and IV. In Figure 2, we graph all countries with greater than 1 percent growth from
Survey I to Survey IV in the left panel and all countries with less than -1 percent growth in the
right panel. In 44 countries the ratio increased, while it decreased in 8 countries. Figure 3 shows
the maximum ratio of bank assets to GDP for each country across all four surveys and the survey
when this maximum occurred. It is also seen in the figure that most of countries reported the
highest ratio in Survey IV.
Bank concentration and ownership have also changed materially. We again illustrate
changes in concentration and ownership between Survey I and Survey IV for all countries that
have information for both surveys. Figure 4’s right panel shows that some countries have
experienced sharp reductions in bank concentration, which is measured by the share of assets in
the five largest banks. Most of the countries that experienced these pronounced reductions in
concentration have small financial systems. Figure 4’s left panel shows even more countries
experienced notable increases in concentration, including Germany, Malaysia, Turkey, Spain,
Italy, Brazil, Chile, Australia, South Korea, Canada, and the United States. Across all countries
that provided data on bank concentration for Survey I and Survey IV, the average level of bank

9
concentration was 66 percent in Survey I and 70 percent in Survey IV, indicating a 4 percentage
point increase in average bank concentration.
In many countries, state ownership of banks also changed appreciably between Survey I
and Survey IV, where state ownership is defined as the proportion of banking assets in
government owned banks (where a bank is considered government owned if 50 percent or more
of system’s assets are owned by the government). Figure 5 shows that a substantial number of
countries experienced large decreases in state ownership, especially in such big countries as
Germany, India, and Russia, where state ownership was particularly large in 1999. As with all of
the figures, we include those countries with data in both Survey I and Survey IV. A number of
countries also reported large increases in the share of bank assets controlled by state owned
banks. The most striking case is the United Kingdom with an increasing share amounting to 26
percent in 2010, due to the bailout of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008, while the
corresponding share was 0 percent in the first survey. For those countries with data on state
ownership of banks for both Survey I and Survey IV, the average percentage of total bank assets
in state owned banks was 21 percent in 1999 and 15 percent in 2011.
One of the most significant changes, and one that has greatly complicated the world of
bank regulation and supervision, is the dramatic increase in the share of total bank assets in
foreign owned banks, as shown in Figure 6. The share of total bank assets in foreign owned
banks is defined as the proportion of banking assets in foreign owned banks, where a bank is
considered foreign owned if 50 percent or more of system’s assets are foreign owned. From
Survey I to Survey IV, 76 percent of the countries experienced an increase in the share of bank
assets in foreign owned banks. Across all countries that provided data for both surveys, the
average percentage of bank assets in foreign owned banks was 47 percent in 2011, up from 29

percent in 1999.

10
This substantial increase emphasizes the importance of cross-country

coordination in the resolution of big banks that operate globally.
Beyond these general characteristics of banking systems, there are also cross-country
differences in the organization of bank regulatory and supervisory institutions. Tables 2-4
provide information on whether countries have single or multiple supervisory authorities for
commercial banks, whether the bank supervisor is in the central bank or a separate agency (or
both, in the case of multiple supervisors), and whether there is a single financial supervisor for
the entire financial system, respectively. Table 2 shows that the vast majority of countries have a
single bank supervisory authority: 126 countries have a single bank supervisory authority, while
only ten have multiple authorities, including the United States.
Table 3 provides information on whether the central bank is a bank supervisory authority.
It is seen that in 89 countries the central bank is the only such authority. In contrast, in 38
countries the central bank is not a supervisory authority at all. The remaining 9 countries that
provide information indicate that the central bank is one among multiple supervisors, with the
United States being one of these countries.
Since banks are not the only financial firms, information was also requested as to whether
a country has a single financial supervisory authority or multiple authorities. Table 4 provides
information on the scope of coverage by financial supervisory authorities in countries. In 101
countries there are multiple authorities covering the financial sector, while in 25 countries there
is a single authority covering the entire financial sector. Most of the countries with a single
authority are relatively small in terms of both population and GDP.

III. Aggregating the Data: The Art and Science of Forming Indices

11
There are formidable conceptual challenges to aggregating the information contained in
the answers to detailed questions from the surveys into meaningful and usable measures of bank
regulatory and supervisory practices. While fully aware of the challenges, we have formulated a
set of indexes with the goals of measuring major features of each country’s regulatory and
supervisory regime and gauging how these features have evolved over time. Table 5 shows a full
list of variables in the dataset with the definition, quantification, and specific questions for each
variable.
In the paper, we describe some of the indexes and provide some cross-country and timeseries comparisons. In the online data file, we show precisely how each aggregate index is
constructed from the individual components of the survey. We also organize the data file, so that
it is easy for researchers to construct their own indexes from the individual responses.

III. A. Scope of Bank Activities and Financial Conglomerate Variables
National regulators license banks and specify permissible activities. Countries may
restrict banks to a narrow range of activities, or allow them to engage in a broad array. Since the
scope of activities helps define what is meant by a “bank” and since the scope of permissible
activities differs across countries, banks are not the same across countries. Furthermore, bank
regulations define the extent to which banks and nonbanks may combine to form financial (i.e.,
bank and nonbank financial) or mixed (i.e., bank and nonbank nonfinancial) conglomerates.
From the survey questions, we construct indexes of the degree to which national
regulations restrict banks from engaging in (1) securities activities, (2) insurance activities, and
(3) real estate activities. More specifically, securities activities refers to securities underwriting,
brokering, dealing, and all aspects of the mutual fund industry. Insurance activities involve
insurance underwriting and selling. And real estate activities refer to real estate investment,

12
development, and management. The index values for securities, insurance, and real estate range
from 1 to 4, where larger values indicate more restrictions on banks performing each activity. In
particular, 4 signifies prohibited, 3 indicates that there are tight restrictions on the provision of
the activity, 2 means that the activity is permitted but with some limits, and 1 signals that the
activity is permitted.
For each of these three bank activity indexes, Figure 7 provides information on the
distribution of countries by the degree of restrictiveness for Survey I and Survey IV. The data
file contains this information by country for all four surveys. The figure shows that securities
activities are the least restricted of the bank activities, while real estate activities are the most
restricted. Focusing on Survey IV, only 9 of 124 countries actually prohibit banks from engaging
in securities activities. In contrast, 42 countries prohibit them from engaging in real estate
activities. With respect to insurance, 19 countries prohibit banks from engaging in this type of
activity. Guyana and Uganda are the only countries that completely prohibit banks from
engaging in all three activities (securities, insurance, and real estate). However, 12 other
countries either completely prohibit or put specific some restrictions on all of these activities.
As illustrated, there is great cross-country variability in the degree to which countries
restrict banks from engaging in different activities. The regulatory notion of a bank, therefore,
differs markedly across countries — and, this definition changes over time within the same
country, which is also illustrated in Figure 7. For example, Kosovo, Moldova, Slovakia, United
Arab Emirates and Uruguay prohibit insurance and real estate activities but allow unrestricted
securities activities, while three countries grant banks unrestricted securities, insurance, and real
estate powers – Hong Kong, Jersey and Switzerland. All of these countries, moreover, have a
single bank supervisory authority.

13
We also constructed two indexes of the degree to which national regulations (1) restrict
banks from owning nonfinancial firms and (2) restrict nonfinancial firms from owning banks.
These particular regulations are quite important and, needless to say, controversial. Figure 7
shows that the degree of overall financial conglomerates restrictiveness displays substantial
variation across countries. Based on Survey IV, bank ownership of nonfinancial firms is more
restricted than nonfinancial firm ownership of banks. About 30 percent of the countries prohibit
bank ownership of nonfinancial firms, whereas only one of 124 countries prohibits ownership of
banks by nonfinancial firms. Fifteen percent of the countries, including the U.S., restrict the
mixing of banking and commerce.
Comparing Survey IV to Survey I, Figure 7 shows that there was a substantial increase in
the number of countries prohibiting bank ownership of nonfinancial firms, an increase to 38 from
8. The opposite is the case for prohibiting banks from engaging in insurance activities, with a
decrease to 19 countries from 40. There was not much of a change with respect to regulatory
restrictions for the other variables in the figure over the thirteen year period from Survey I to
Survey IV. Overall, it seems that most countries allow some co-mingling of bank and nonfinancial firms.
We also construct an index of the overall restrictions on bank activities that measures the
extent to which a bank can both engage in securities, insurance, and real estate activities and own
nonfinancial firms. We include restrictions on banks owning nonfinancial firms in this overall
index of because regulations on the extent to which banks may own nonfinancial firms affects
the ability of a bank to diversify revenue streams and is therefore similar in some ways to the
regulatory restrictions on other activities. Based on four of the indexes defined above, this index
of overall restrictions on bank activities can potentially range from 4 to 16, with higher numbers
indicating greater restrictiveness.

14
Figure 8 provides information on the change in the index of overall restrictions on bank
activities from Survey I to Survey IV. Positive numbers indicate an increase in restrictions. As
with many features of bank regulation and supervision, there is great cross-country
heterogeneity. Of the countries in the figure, 43 of them increased restrictions and 36 countries
decreased restrictions. In the case of another 18 countries there was no change. The country that
increased restrictions the most was Seychelles, while the country that decreased restrictions the
most was Romania. For those countries with data used to construct index of overall restrictions
on bank activities for both Survey I and Survey IV, the average index value goes from 7.4 down
to 7.2, which means that on average countries decreased overall restrictions from 1999 to 2011.
We also examine whether countries tightened or eased the overall restrictions on bank
activities following the global financial crisis. This is done by comparing the index values for
Survey III and IV. Table 6 shows that 80 percent of the countries tightened such restrictions
following the crisis.

III. B. Capital Regulations
Capital regulations represent a mainstay of banking sector policies around the world.
Many rules and policies determine the precise amount and nature of capital that banks must hold.
In terms of the amount of capital, this is typically characterized in terms of the ratio of capital to
total banks assets. In terms of the nature of capital, there are policies concerning the definition of
capital beyond cash or government securities, the definition and valuation of bank assets, and
whether the regulatory and supervisory authorities verify the sources of capital.
We construct indexes of the stringency of bank capital regulations that measure the
amount of capital banks must hold and the stringency of regulations on the nature and source of
regulatory capital. It is composed of the answers from specific survey questions: (1) Is the

15
capital-asset ratio risk weighted in line with the Basle I guidelines? (2) Does the minimum
capital-asset ratio vary as a function of an individual bank’s credit risk? (3) Does the minimum
capital-asset ratio vary as a function of market risk? (4) Before minimum capital adequacy is
determined, which of the following are deducted from the book value of capital? Market value of
loan losses not realized in accounting books? Unrealized losses in securities portfolios? Or
unrealized foreign exchange losses? (5) What fraction of revaluation gains is allowed as part of
capital? (6) Are the sources of funds to be used as capital verified by the regulatory/supervisory
authorities? (7) Can the initial disbursement or subsequent injections of capital be done with
assets other than cash or government securities? and (8) Can initial disbursement of capital be
done with borrowed funds? Larger values of this index of bank capital regulation indicate more
stringent capital regulation. The maximum possible value is 10, while the minimum possible
value is 0. Figure 9 indicates the change in the index of bank capital regulations from Surveys I
to IV, where positive numbers indicate an increase in restrictions on bank capital. Of the 107
countries, 65 increased the stringency of capital regulation, 28 decreased them, and 14 made no
changes.
Since Survey IV covers the period after the emergence of the global financial crisis and
the introduction of Basel III, we compare capital regulation before and after the crisis by
examining the change in the capital regulatory restrictions index from Survey III to Survey IV.
Table 7 shows that 79 percent of the countries increased the stringency of their capital
regulations following the crisis, including the United States. Note, however, that at least up to the
time of the latest survey, Austria, Mexico and the United Kingdom had reduced the stringency of
their capital regulations in the aftermath of the crisis.

III. C. Official Supervisory Power

16
An important aspect of supervision is whether the supervisory authorities possess the
power to obtain information from banks and take an assortment of actions to change the behavior
of banks based on the assessments of the official supervisory authority. In some cases, the
authorities might even be required to take corrective action to address a problem, and in other
cases the authorities may have the discretionary power to act as they see fit. Courts, moreover,
may intervene in some instances and thereby limit, delay or even reverse actions taken by the
supervisory authorities, but in other cases, the courts have less power over the regulatory and
supervisory agencies.
We construct an index of official supervisory power to measure the degree to which the
country’s bank supervisory agency has the authority to take specific actions. It is composed of
the answers from specific survey questions: (1) Does the supervisory agency have the right to
meet with external auditors about banks? (2) Are auditors required to communicate directly to
the supervisory agency about elicit activities, fraud, or insider abuse? (3) Can supervisors take
legal action against external auditors for negligence? (4) Can the supervisory authority force a
bank to change its internal organizational structure? (5) Are off-balance sheet items disclosed to
supervisors? (6) Can the supervisory agency order the bank’s directors or management to
constitute provisions to cover actual or potential losses? (7) Can the supervisory agency suspend
the directors’ decision to distribute (a) dividends, (b) bonuses, and (c) management fees? (8) Can
the supervisory agency supersede the rights of bank shareholders and declare a bank insolvent?
(9) Can the supervisory agency suspend some or all ownership rights? (10) Can the supervisory
agency (a) supersede shareholder rights, (b) remove and replace management, and (c) remove
and replace directors? The official supervisory index has a maximum value of 14 and a minimum
value of 0, where larger numbers indicate greater power.

17
Figure 10 indicates the change in the index of official supervisory powers from Surveys I
to IV, where positive numbers indicate an increase in such powers. On balance, slightly more
countries weakened the powers of their official supervisory agencies than strengthened those
powers. A number of countries indicated no change, including the United States. One might
think that whether a country weakens or strengthens official supervisory powers would be
important for helping predict whether banks would operate safely and soundly. However, an
increase in supervisory power was not found to be helpful in promoting bank development,
performance, or stability in our earlier work (Barth, Caprio, and Levine, 2006). Indeed, we found
that in countries with weak democratic institutions, official supervisory power was associated
with increased corruption in the lending process with no corresponding beneficial effects on
stability.
To determine whether countries tightened increased or decreased official supervisory
powers following the global financial crisis, we compare the index values for Survey III and IV.
Somewhat surprisingly, Table 8 shows that 45 percent of the countries decreased such powers.
The surveys also provide information on whether supervisory authorities must report as
well as take mandatory actions when they identify infractions of prudential regulations. Table 9
provides information in this regard. It is interesting that 127 countries indicate that infractions
must be reported when found, while in only 11 countries is this not the case. The number of
countries that require mandatory actions to be taken when infractions are found is 105, while 33
countries do not require mandatory actions. Israel is a country that neither requires the reporting
of infractions nor mandatory actions when they are found. The United Kingdom and the United
States both require the reporting of infractions, but of these two countries, only the United States
requires mandatory actions. The table also provides information on whether supervisors are

18
legally liable for their actions. Only 23 countries report that this is the case, whereas in 118
countries supervisors are not held liable.

III. D. Private Monitoring and External Governance
III. D. 1 Private Monitoring
Regulatory and supervisory policies can also shape the incentives and ability of private
investors to monitor and exert effective governance over banks. For example, the degree to
which supervisory agencies require banks to obtain certified audits and/or ratings from
international-rating agencies and disseminate accurate, comprehensive and consolidated
information on the full range of their activities and risk-management procedures may influence
the quality of private sector scrutiny of banks. To the extent that national regulatory and
supervisory authorities make bank directors legally liable if information is erroneous or
misleading might similarly influence the quality of information provided by banks to private
investors and hence the ability of those investors to monitor and govern banks. And, the
incentives of private investor to obtain and process information and then exert governance over
bank executives will surely be shaped by the degree to which countries have either credibly
demonstrated that they will not bailout investors of failed banks or indicated their willingness to
protect those investors. Thus, private monitoring is not simply an absence of regulations and
supervision. Official supervisory policies also shape private monitoring by forcing information
disclosure and defining the liability and hence incentives of private investors.
We construct an index of private monitoring to examine the degree to which regulatory
and supervisory policies encourage the private monitoring of banks that builds on an array of
individual questions contained in the survey. Specifically, the private monitoring index is
composed of information on (1) whether bank directors and officials are legally liable for the

19
accuracy of information disclosed to the public, (2) whether banks must publish consolidated
accounts, (3) whether banks must be audited by certified international auditors, (4) whether 100
percent of the largest 10 banks are rated by international rating agencies, (5) whether off-balance
sheet items are disclosed to the public, (6) whether banks must disclose their risk management
procedures to the public, (7) whether accrued, though unpaid interest/principal, enter the income
statement while the loan is still non-performing, (8) whether subordinated debt is allowable as
part of capital, and (9) whether there is no explicit deposit insurance system and no insurance
was paid the last time a bank failed. Thus, the maximum value of the private monitoring index is
12 and the minimum value is 0, where larger values indicate greater regulatory empowerment of
the monitoring of banks by private investors.
Figure 11 indicates the change in the index of private monitoring from Survey I to IV.
Positive values in this figure indicate that private monitoring strengthened over time, while
negative values signify a reduction in the degree to which official policies support the monitoring
of banks by private investors. As shown, there is great diversity in terms of whether regulations
associated with private monitoring have strengthened or weakened. Once again, relatively small
countries such as the Philippines, Finland and Tajikistan were generally those that reduced
private monitoring to the greatest degree, while comparatively large countries like France, India
and the United States increased it the most. On average, there was a slight increase in private
monitoring, such that average value of the private monitoring index was 7.7 in 1999 and it was
7.9 in 2011.
To determine whether countries increased or decreased private monitoring powers
following the global financial crisis, we compare the index values for Survey III and IV. Table
10 shows that about half of the countries increased such powers, with the other half decreased

20
the extent to which official regulatory and supervisory policies encourage and facilitate the
monitoring of banks by private investors.

III. D. 2 External Governance
Building on the Private Monitoring index, we construct a broader index of the degree to
which regulations facilitate external governance by debt and equity holders. The index is
composed of the answers from specific survey questions: (1) Is an audit by a professional
external auditor required for all commercial banks in your jurisdiction? (2) Are specific
requirements for the extent or nature of the audit spelled out? (3) Are auditors licensed or
certified? (4) Do supervisors get a copy of the auditor’s report? (5) Does the supervisory agency
have the right to meet with external auditors to discuss their report without the approval of the
bank? (6) Are auditors required by law to communicate directly to the supervisory agency any
presumed involvement of bank directors or senior managers in illicit activities, fraud, or insider
abuse? (7) Can supervisors take legal action against external auditors for negligence? (8) Does
accrued, though unpaid, interest/principal enter the income statement while the loan is still
performing? (9) Are financial institutions required to produce consolidated accounts covering all
bank and any non-bank financial subsidiaries? (10) Are off-balance sheet items disclosed to the
public? (11) Must banks disclose their risk management procedures to the public? (12) Are bank
directors legally liable if information disclosed is erroneous or misleading? (13) Does accrued,
though unpaid, interest/principal enter the income statement while the loan is still nonperforming? (14) Are accounting practices for banks in accordance with International
Accounting Standards (IAS)? (15) Are accounting practices for banks in accordance with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAS)? (16) Is subordinated debt allowable as part
of capital? (17) Is subordinated debt required as part of capital? (18) Do regulations require

21
credit ratings for commercial banks? (19) What percentage of the top ten banks is rated by
international credit rating agencies (e.g., Moody's, Standard and Poor’s)? and (20) How many of
the top ten banks are rated by domestic credit rating agencies? The values of the external
governance index range from 0 to 19, with higher values indicating a great degree of external
governance.
Figure 12 indicates the change in the index of external governance from Survey I to IV,
where the positive values indicate an increase of external governance. Of the 42 countries
providing data for both Survey I and Survey IV, 37 tightened external governance, 3 (Malaysia,
Panama, and Fiji) eased it, and 2 (Argentina and Finland) made no changes. On average, the
index values increased from 12.6 in 1999 to 15.3 in 2011.We then examine how counties
changed their external governance following the recent banking crisis. Table 11 shows
information of countries with data available for both Survey I and IV. Of 33 countries, 22
tightened external governance, and 11 eased it from 1999 to 2011.

III. E. Explicit Deposit Insurance Schemes
Policies associated with insuring the deposits of banks may also shape the performance of
banking systems. Countries often adopt deposit insurance to prevent bank runs. When depositors
attempt to withdraw their funds all at once, some illiquid but solvent individual banks may be
forced into insolvency and there is also the potential for contagious bank runs on otherwise
healthy banks. Thus, many countries enact deposit insurance schemes to reduce the probability
of systemic crises. But, deposit insurance can encourage excessive risk-taking by banks by
reducing the incentives of depositors to monitor bank executives and curtail excessive risk
taking. Thus, the precise design of deposit insurance schemes, including coverage limits, scope

22
of coverage, whether coinsurance is a feature, sources of funding, premia structure, and
management and membership requirements, may materially shape bank and depositor behavior.
We construct an index of deposit insurer power to measure each country’s deposit
insurance regime and to trace its evolution from 1999 to 2011. In particular, the deposit
insurance index is composed of the following individual questions from the surveys: (1) Does the
deposit insurance agency/fund administrator have the bank intervention authority as part of its
mandate? (2) Does the deposit insurance authority by itself have the legal power to cancel or
revoke deposit insurance for any participating bank? (3) Can the deposit insurance agency/fund
take legal action for violations against laws, regulations, and bylaws (of the deposit insurance
agency) against bank directors or other bank officials? and (4) Has the deposit insurance
agency/fund ever taken legal action for violations against laws, regulations, and bylaws (of the
deposit insurance agency) against bank directors or other bank officials? The values of the
deposit insurance index range from 0 to 4, with higher values indicating more power.
Figure 13 indicates the change in the index of deposit insurance from Surveys I to IV.
The positive numbers indicate an increase of deposit insurance power. There are 75 countries
providing data for both Surveys I and IV. Of these countries, 22 increased the power and 18
decrease it, while 35 countries made no changes. On average, there was a very slight increase in
deposit insurance power, such that the average value of the index was 1.06 in 1999 and 1.08 in
2011.
As Table 12 shows, 98 of the 143 countries responding to Survey IV had established a
deposit insurance protection system for banks. Such schemes are most common among highincome countries and least common among low-income countries. The table also shows that
there are a number of differences in (1) whether participation by banks is compulsory and (2) the
scope of coverage. Of the countries providing data, 95 require domestic banks to participate,

23
while 86 (62) also require foreign bank subsidiaries (foreign bank branches) to participate.
Roughly three-fourths of the countries provide coverage for foreign currency deposits but at the
same time exclude interbank deposits. The most common type of deposit insurance coverage is
per depositor per institution rather than per depositor or per depositor account.
We next examine how countries changed their deposit insurance regimes following the
recent banking crisis. Since Survey III provides information just before the global financial crisis
and Survey IV provides similar information right after the crisis fully emerged, we provide
information on whether or not changes were made in the coverage provided by the deposit
insurance system in selected advanced countries. All these countries suffered a banking crisis,
which makes it useful to determine whether any important changes were made in their deposit
insurance schemes. Table 13 shows that four countries that reported that they had a formal
coinsurance feature as part of their deposit insurance schemes prior to the global financial crisis
eliminated this feature in 2011. In addition, two countries that had not had deposit insurance fees
based on some assessment of risk made a switch to include them from Survey III to Survey IV,
while one country did the reverse.
An additional point that should be made before concluding this section is the resolution
of insolvent banks. To the extent that a bank is a subsidiary of a holding company, an issue that
arises is whether the deposit insurance supervisory authority or other regulatory authority is able
to seize the holding company or just a subsidiary bank. In the United States, the regulatory
authorities have been only able to seize and resolve subsidiary banks, not the parent holding
companies, until the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. In this case, insolvent banks were
seized and resolved by the regulatory authorities, while the parent holding companies were
handled by bankruptcy courts. Information provided by Survey IV indicates that in 73 countries

24
the insolvency framework is the same for holding companies and banks, but different in 59
countries.

III. F. Restrictions on Entry into Banking
The degree of competition in banking depends importantly on entry barriers. Regulators
in most countries do not allow just anyone to enter the banking system, but rather screen entrants
to better assure they are “fit and proper.” By imposing the fairly basic requirements identified
above before a banking license is accepted or rejected, those allowed to enter may be of higher
quality and thereby enhance the overall performance of the banking industry.
We construct an entry into banking index to measure each country’s requirements of
entering into banking and to trace its evolution from 1999 to 2011. In particular, this index is
based on whether or not the following information is required of applicants for a banking license:
(1) Draft by-laws; (2) Intended organizational chart; (3) Financial projections for first three
years; (4) Financial information on main potential shareholders; (5) Background/experience of
future directors; (6) Background/experience of future managers; (7) Sources of funds to be used
to capitalize the new bank; and (8) Market differentiation intended for the new bank. The values
of the index of entry into banking range from 0 to 8, with higher values indicating greater
stringency.
Figure 14 identifies the change in the index of entry into banking from Survey I to IV.
The selected countries are the ones providing data both for Survey I and IV. Among the 136
countries, 35 countries increased the entry into banking requirements, 16 decreased the
requirements, and 85 countries did not make changes. On average, there was a slight increase in
entry into banking requirements, such that the average value of the index was 7.5 in 1999 and it
was 7.8 in 2011.

III. G. Additional information
Clearly, the number of questions asked in all four surveys is far too large to provide an
adequate discussion of all of them in this paper. Indeed, it took over 100 pages in our book
(Barth, Caprio, and Levine, 2006, Chapter 3) that focused only on Survey I to describe the data.
The online dataset that we make available, however, provides details on each question in each
survey, the formulas for constructing each of the indexes discussed above, and all of the
information on several other indexes of bank regulation and supervision. Thus, this paper
provides an introduction to the online dataset, but is not a complete description of every aspect of
these data.
To provide additional summary information on Survey IV and advertise the enormous
heterogeneity of bank regulatory and supervisory policies across countries, Appendix Tables 4
and 5 and Table 14 give the values of key regulatory and supervisory policies for different cuts
of the data. The minimum and maximum values in Appendix Table 4 are useful because they
help indicate whether an item is measured as an index, in days, as a percentage or as a pure
number. This table shows that there is substantial variation in the values of the different items
across the various countries, with the number of countries providing information also indicated.
Appendix Table 5 provides the average values for the same items included in the Appendix
Table 4 with the countries grouped into different categories based on income level, development
status and whether or not an offshore center. Table 14 further advertises the lack of uniformity in
various regulations and supervisory practices in countries around the world.

III. H. Some new information in Survey IV
Survey IV contains all the questions in the three earlier surveys that are necessary to
construct the indices discussed earlier as well as other indices discussed more fully in Barth,

26
Caprio, and Levine (2006) and provided in the online dataset. In addition, the latest survey
includes some new and important questions that were asked due to the global financial crisis. In
particular, given the concern over systemic risk, questions are added to determine what countries
are doing in an effort designed to better assess systemic risk within the banking sector. Of 133
countries, 90 of them indicate that they have a specialized department dealing with financial
stability and systemic supervision, while the remaining 43 reported they do not have such a
department. Countries in which these departments exist include Austria, Belgium, France,
Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Denmark, Switzerland and the
United States report not having established a specialized department dealing with financial
stability and systemic supervision.
Figure 15 shows the factors that countries consider in assessing systemic risk within the
banking sector. The factor that regulators in the most countries consider is bank capital ratios
(113), while the least mentioned factor is stock market prices (46). Countries that report that all
of the factors are considered include Austria, Iceland, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United
Kingdom and the United States. These are advanced countries that suffered a banking crisis.
Some other advanced economies that suffered a banking crisis, like France, Germany and
Ireland, do not indicate that they consider any of the factors indicated in the figure.
There are still other new questions asked in Survey IV that are important, especially
given the most recent global financial crisis. Some of the questions as well as the number of
countries responding and their collective answers are reported in Table 15. These questions focus
on external auditors, remuneration or compensation, insolvency framework for bank holding
companies and banks, stress tests, counter-cyclical regulations, and the supervision of the
systemic institutions verses non-systemic ones. Once again, there is in most cases a substantial
divergence from uniformity in the answers. Focusing on just the advanced countries listed in

27
Table 12, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland report that supervisors delegate part of their
supervisory tasks to external auditors, whereas France, Spain, the United Kingdom and the
United States do not. All of these advanced countries report that remuneration or compensation
is evaluated as part of the supervisory process to ensure that they do not lead to excessive risk
taking, with the exception of Belgium as regards the board of directors. The same countries,
moreover, all report that they conduct stress tests and do so at the bank level. Six of the 16
countries extend the tests to the system-wide level. The last item to be mentioned here is whether
countries impose any restrictions or limits on the size of banks to address the issue of systemic
risk. Of the 63 countries providing information, only 11 report such size restrictions or limits,
including Iceland and Ireland.
The last new piece of information that is provided in Survey IV is the statutory corporate
tax rate on domestic bank income. Figure 16 shows the substantial variance in tax rates among
the countries, which range from a low of 0 to a high of 45 percent. Guyana reports the highest
tax rate, while six other countries report that there is no tax imposed on domestic bank income.
As regards the United States, it reports the fifth highest tax rate, with 108 countries reporting
lower tax rates.

III. I. Convergence
Since Survey I in 1999, national regulatory authorities around the world have met at
various international institutions and conferences. Thus, it is natural to assess whether bank
regulatory and supervisory practices have converged across countries. Though there are many
ways to assess convergence, Table 16 provides some simple summary statistics.
Table 16 provides information on the degree to which the major bank regulatory survey
indexes that we constructed have tended to converge from Survey I (1999) to Survey IV (2011).

28
We provide information on (i) Overall restrictions on bank activities, (ii) Entry into banking
requirements, (iii) Bank capital regulations, (iv) Official supervisory powers, (v) Private
monitoring, and (vi) External governance. For each index, we only include countries for which
we have data for Survey I and IV. We provide two types of measures of convergence. First, we
simply provide the normalized standard deviation in Survey I and Survey IV for each index.
Second, we assess the number of countries that are x% different from the median value, where x
equals 10%, 25%, 30%, and 50%.
Although for a few of the indexes, the data suggest material convergence, Table 15 does
not suggest broad-based convergence of bank regulatory and supervisory practices. In particular,
the indexes (i) Entry into banking requirements, (ii) Bank capital regulations, and (iii) External
governance exhibit notable convergence in that there is less divergence across countries in
Survey IV than there is in Survey I. Such convergence is less noticeable in the other regulatory
and supervisory indexes. Overall, as of 2011, there is greater cross-country divergence in bank
regulation and supervision.

IV. Conclusions
In this paper and the associated online database, we provide a new database on bank
regulatory and supervisory policies in 180 countries that covers the period from 1999 through
2011. This database builds directly on four World Bank surveys of bank regulation and
supervision around the world. The database that we offer differs from the underlying survey data
in two key respects: we address many inconsistencies and missing observations in the core
survey responses and we construct a range of indexes to provide information on key banking
policies. Providing the indexes is crucial for comparing bank regulatory and supervisory policies
across countries and for assessing how these policies change over time because the underlying

29
surveys are enormous and complex. The surveys include hundreds of questions, such that it is
difficult to form impressions of banking sector policies by examining these individual questions
one by one. Thus, we construct summary indexes from the individual questions to measure key
features of the regulatory and supervisory approaches to what banks can do, capital standards,
the powers of official supervisory agencies, regulations on the entry of new banks, the degree to
which the authorities encourage the monitoring of banks by private investors, the nature of the
deposit insurance regime, and an assortment of other policies towards banks.
There is substantial heterogeneity of bank regulatory and supervisory policies across countries.
And, although there has been some convergence over the last dozen years for some types of
banking sector policies, bank regulatory and supervisory policies remain impressively diverse in
2011. This diversity in regulatory regimes provides enormous scope for research examining both
the causes of these policy differences and the impacts of banking policies on the performance of
banks, and the associated ramifications for the overall financial sector and real economy.
