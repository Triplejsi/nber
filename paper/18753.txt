Distribution Capital and the Short- and Long-Run Import Demand Elasticity

ABSTRACT
The elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is one of the most important parameters
in international economics. The international macro literature, which is primarily concerned with short-run
business cycle fluctuations, assigns a low value to this parameter. The international trade literature,
which is more concerned with long-run changes in trade flows following a change in relative prices,
assigns a high value to this parameter. This paper constructs a model where this discrepancy between
the short- and long-run elasticities is due to frictions in distribution. Goods need to be combined with
a local non-traded input, distribution capital, which is good specific. Home and foreign goods may
be close substitutes, but if distribution capital is slow to adjust then agents cannot shift their consumption
in the short run following a change in relative prices, and home and foreign goods appear as poor substitutes
in the short run. In the long run this distribution capital can be reallocated, and agents can shift their
purchases following a change in relative prices. Thus the observed substitutability gets larger as time
passes.

Introduction

The elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods, also called the Armington
elasticity, is one of the most important parameters in dynamic equilibrium models of international trade and business cycles. The parameter determines how quantities adjust in
response to a change in relative prices, and thus determines how quantities of imports and
exports adjust after a shift in the real exchange rate. Trade models rely on this parameter
to determine the e¤ect of trade policy and tari¤ rates on trade ‡ows and welfare. Macro
models rely on this parameter to determine the business cycle e¤ects of certain macro shocks
and the business cycle properties of international macro models.
The problem, as highlighted in Ruhl (2005) and Arkolakis, Eaton and Kortum (2012), is
that the trade literature and the international macro literature don’t agree on the value of
this parameter. Macro models, which are concerned with short-run ‡uctuations, generally
ascribe a low value to this parameter. In the workhorse international real business cycle
model, Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1994) assign a value of 1.5 to the Armington elasticity
and discuss how the model fails to replicate the negative co-movement between the terms of
trade and net exports for values of the elasticity that are too high (above 3). In the calibration
of their model, Kose and Yi (2006) use this same value. Stockman and Tesar (1995) use
a Cobb-Douglas speci…cation, and thus an elasticity of 1, to aggregate home and foreign
goods. Heathcote and Perri (2002) estimate the Armington elasticity from an equation that
links changes in the real exchange rate to changes in net exports and relative production.
They estimate a value of the Armington elasticity of around 0.9. Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc
(2008) use a value of around 0.85. They arrive at this value by calibrating their model to
match certain features of the data, most notably the second moments of international relative
prices like the real exchange rate and the terms of trade. Enders, Müller and Scholl (2011)
construct a model to speci…cally explain the path of the real exchange rate and the terms
of trade following either a productivity or government spending shock. They …nd that the
model calibrated with a high elasticity of substitution yields counterfactual results as to the
response of the real exchange rate following a shock.
Similarly, in estimations using data on relative prices and import shares, Blonigen, Liebman and Wilson (1999) use quarterly data and …nd an average elasticity of about 0.81.
Hooper, Johnson and Marquez (1998) and Gallaway, McDaniel and Rivera (2003) use a regression framework that allows them to distinguish between short- and long-run elasticities.
They …nd that import demand elasticities are typically much larger in the long run than
they are in the short run.
On the trade side, in their survey of the literature on trade costs, Anderson and van

3

Wincoop (2004) …nd that the import demand elasticity is generally found to lie between
5 and 10. Hillberry et al. (2001) …nd long run estimates of the elasticity between 4 and
8. Hummels (1999) backs the elasticity parameter out of an estimated gravity model after
estimating the elasticity of trade costs with respect to distance and …nds the elasticity is
about 5. In a similar fashion, Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000) …nd that when the elasticity of
substitution is equal to 6, the observed home bias in trade can be reconciled with estimated
international trade costs. Head and Reis (2001), Clausing (2001), and Romalis (2007) each
estimate the elasticity using U.S.-Canadian trade data from before and after the passage of
the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and …nd the elasticity is somewhere between 6 and
11. Eaton and Kortum (2002) estimate a parameter that can be thought of as an import
demand elasticity and …nd a value of 8.
The discrepancy between short- and long-run estimates of the elasticity of substitution
is closely related to the literature on the J-curve. As noted in Junz and Rhomberg (1973)
and Magee (1973), after a change in international relative prices, like an exchange rate
depreciation, quantities do not always adjust instantaneously. This is closely related to the
famous Marshall-Lerner condition, which states that in order for a currency depreciation to
lead to an improvement in the trade balance, the sum of the absolute values of the import
demand elasticity and export demand elasticity must be greater than one. If the sum of the
elasticities is smaller than one in the short run then the currency depreciation will actually
lead to a worsening of the trade balance, but if the elasticities get larger with time, then the
trade balance should improve in the long run following an exchange rate depreciation.1
This paper presents a novel mechanism to explain why exports and imports may be
slow to respond to a change in relative prices, and thus why the observed import demand
elasticity may be low in the short run but high in the long run. In this paper, traded goods
need to be combined with a local non-traded component (distribution services) before they
can be consumed. Frictions and bottlenecks within this distribution sector may lead to the
slow adjustment of quantities following a change in relative prices.
By explicitly modeling a distribution sector, this paper is similar to Burstein, Neves and
Rebelo (2003), Burstein, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2005; 2007), Corsetti and Dedola (2005)
and Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc (2008). These authors discuss how the observed import
demand elasticity is di¤erent from the Armington elasticity of substitution when the cost
of a local non-traded component makes up a large part of the cost of an imported good.2

of a J-curve e¤ect and evidence that the Marshall-Lerner condition holds in the long run but may not hold
in the short run. See also Rose (1991) for evidence that the Marshall-Lerner condition does not hold and
that the trade balance is largely independent of movements in the real exchange rate in at least the …rst two
years following a change in the exchange rate.

However, unlike these models, we assume that the inputs that are used for the distribution of
domestic goods can’t be reallocated to the distribution of imported goods in the short run.
The technological elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods may be high
and they may be highly substitutable in the long run after the inputs used in distribution
can be reallocated, but in the short run frictions in distribution may limit the response of
relative quantities to a change in relative prices, making home and foreign goods appear as
poor substitutes.
If in response to a positive foreign shock, home agents try to rapidly increase their
purchases of imports, they strain the supply of this local component and face a steeply
increasing marginal cost curve. In the short run the increasing marginal cost of the nontraded component largely cancels out the fall in the price of the imported good. As a result,
the …nal prices paid by consumers may barely change in the short run in response to a change
in relative price of imports.3 As time passes, the supply of the non-traded component is able
to adjust more easily and thus there is a greater response to the quantity of imports following
a change in their relative wholesale price.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The model is presented in section 2. In the
version of the model without local non-traded inputs, the model collapses to the benchmark
IRBC model in Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1994). The benchmark calibration of the model
is presented in section 3. Here we will pay particular attention to the calibration of the key
parameters involved in the distribution sector, and how the value of these parameters can be
inferred from micro-data on prices. The results from the di¤erent versions of the model are
presented in section 4. First we solve analytically for the observed import demand elasticity
following a change in the relative price of imports. We then compare the di¤erent versions of
the model, the version with a high elasticity of substitution as measured in the international
trade literature, the version with the low elasticity as measured in the international macro
literature, and the version with the high elasticity of substitution but a local non-traded
component that is inelastically supplied in the short run. Only the version of the model with
a high elasticity of substitution but an inelastically supplied local non-traded component can
replicate both the short-run properties of aggregate prices and quantities that we observe
in the data while also reproducing the observed long-run import demand elasticity. Finally,
price of an imported good, Berger et al. (2012) argue that the distribution margin is between 50 70%.
3
Thus the mechanism in the model is similar to that in any model where a change in relative prices at
the wholesale level doesn’t pass through into …nal prices. Campa and Goldberg (2005) and many other
papers document the low pass through of exchange rate changes into import prices. Drozd and Nosal (2012)
construct a search model where sales require some marketing capital. In this search framework, consumers
initially may not notice a change in the relative price of imported goods. In their model, marketing capital
is acquired slowly but can be lost quickly. As such, sellers have an incentive to keep transitory price changes
from passing through into …nal goods prices.

The Model

2.1

Production

There are two countries, home and foreign. Foreign variables are written with an asterisk
( ) and home variables are not. In the following description of the model, foreign equations
are omitted for brevity.
An aggregate good is used by households for consumption, Ct , investment in production
capital, It , and investment in distribution capital, Id;t . This aggregate good, yt , is formed
through the combination of domestic and imported retail goods, which are combined in an
Armington (1969) aggregator function with an elasticity of substitution .

where yM;t is the quantity of imported goods, and dM;t are distribution services employed
in the distribution of these imports. In the functions for y~D;t and y~M;t , when = 0, the
technology for domestic goods condenses to y~D;t = yD;t and y~M;t = yM;t , and the model
collapses to Backus et al. (1994). From this production function, the retail prices of domestic
and imported goods relative to the home aggregate price de‡ator are:

where pD;t (pM;t ) is the wholesale price of the domestic (imported) good, and cD;t (cM;t ) is
the cost of domestic (import) distribution services.
Wholesale goods are produced by …rms engaged in perfect competition, and thus the
price of a home produced good is equal to its marginal cost of production, M Ct , and the
price of a foreign produced good is equal to its marginal cost of production, M Ct . The
relative price of the domestic good in the home market is thus pD;t = M Ct while the relative
MC
price in the home market of the imported good is pM;t = Qt t , where Qt is the real exchange
rate de…ned as the foreign price level divided by the home price level.
Wholesale goods used domestically or exported to the foreign country, yD;t and yM;t ,
exhaust current period production:
yD;t + yM;t = At Nt1

where Nt and Kt are labor and capital employed in the production of home country goods,

Capital Stocks

There are three separate types of capital in each country, capital used in production, Kt , and
capital used in distribution of either domestic or imported goods, KdD;t and KdM;t . Capital
employed in the production of goods evolves according to the usual capital accumulation
equation:
Kt+1 = (1
) Kt + It
(9)
Distribution capital is earmarked for domestic or imported distribution services. We
will consider two cases about how this capital is allocated for distribution of domestic or
imported goods. In the …rst case we assume that there is one stock of capital dedicated
to distribution. This stock of distribution capital, Kd;t , evolves according to the following
capital accumulation equation:
Kd;t+1 = (1

) Kd;t +

Id;t
Kd;t

Kd;t

(10)

where this distribution capital can be allocated to domestic goods distribution or imported
goods distribution, Kd;t = KdD;t + KdM;t . The adjustment cost for distribution capital is
described by the concave function ( ) ( 0 > 0 and 00 < 0).
In the second case the two markets for distribution capital are segmented in the sense that
capital cannot be reallocated between the distribution of domestic goods and the distribution
of imports. The two types of distribution capital each evolve according to their own capital
accumulation equation:
KdD;t+1 = (1

) KdD;t +

KdM;t+1 = (1

) KdM;t +

IdD;t
KdD;t
KdD;t
IdM;t
KdM;t
KdM;t

(11)

where the total investment in distribution capital, Id;t , is allocated to investment in domestic
or imported goods distribution, Id;t = IdD;t + IdM;t .
The di¤erence between these two cases highlights the key mechanism in this paper. In
the …rst case, where there is only one stock of distribution capital, capital can be reallocated
between domestic goods distribution and imported goods distribution within the period, and
9

thus the rental rates of these two types of capital must be equal in equilibrium rD;t = rM;t .
This ensures that in equilibrium the cost of domestic goods distribution is the same as the
cost of imported goods distribution, cD;t = cM;t .
This …rst case, where the costs of distribution are equal across goods, is very similar to
the distribution sector in Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc (2008).
In the second case, where the markets for the two types of distribution capital are segmented, this equality in distribution costs holds in a long-run steady state, but need not
hold in the short run. Speci…cally, this market segmentation forms a friction in the market for distribution services, and it leads to this result that highly substitutable home and
foreign goods may appear as poor substitutes in the short run. If there is a sudden shift
in international relative prices that make foreign goods cheaper at the wholesale level, the
quantity demanded of imports will increase. However, if distribution capital cannot be reallocated away from domestic goods distribution to imported goods distribution, this increased
quantity demanded for imports will strain the existing stock of imported goods distribution
capital, leading to a bottleneck in the distribution of imported goods. The cost of imported
goods distribution, cM;t , will increase, and this will partially reverse or potentially completely
o¤set the initial fall in the price of foreign goods at the wholesale level.

Calibration

The model described in the previous section is solved with a linear approximation and
simulated in order to produce moments and impulse responses of key variables.
In the next section, simulations of the model under di¤erent values of the Armington
elasticity, , and the parameter controlling the distribution share, , are used to examine the
importance of the distribution sector in a¤ecting the substitutability of home and foreign
traded goods. The rest of the model’s parameters and their benchmark values are found in
table 1.
The …rst six parameters: , the exponent on leisure in the Cobb-Douglas utility function,
, the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion, , the capital share, , the discount factor, !, the
weight on domestic goods in the Armington aggregator function, and , the capital depreciation rate, are all taken from Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1994) and found throughout the
international real business cycle literature.
The next four parameters, , d , , and are the key parameters in distribution.5 To

identify these parameters, we will calculate certain second moments of wholesale prices and
distribution margins from the data and then calibrate the value of these four parameters so
that the model can match speci…c moments of the data.
We use a panel dataset of retail prices for over 300 goods in 123 cities where the price
of each good in each city is observed annually from 1990-2005. The data-set is described in
Crucini and Landry (2012). The dataset covers over 300 goods, but we exclude the goods
that are very close to the de…nition of a non-traded good (like domestic cleaning help), and
aggregate the remaining goods into four sectors, grocery items, non-food consumer goods,
clothing, and transportation. The full list of goods in the dataset and how they are grouped
into four categories is presented in the appendix. We restrict our attention to 13 U.S. cities,
the list of these 13 cities is also presented in the appendix.
Before we discuss how the data is used, consider the price indices for the retail price and
the marginal cost of distribution in (3) and (6). If we linearize these price indices, then the
‡uctuations in the …nal good price, p~it , can be expressed as a combination of the ‡uctuations
in the wholesale price, p^it , the wage rate (non-sector speci…c input into distribution), w^t , and
the rental rate for sector speci…c distribution capital, r^it :

where s measures the steady state distribution margin, s =

In the data set we observe p~ijt , the retail price of the good from sector i in city j at time
t. Crucini and Landry (2012) also provide data on the distribution margin for each good
in the dataset, si .6 Given these prices and the distribution margins we can estimate the
following regression:
p~ijt = (1 si ) it + si jt + si ijt
(12)

where it is sector speci…c …xed e¤ect intended to capture variation in wholesale prices (^
pit ),
and jt is a city-…xed e¤ect intended to capture variation in the city, but not good speci…c
component of distribution (w^t ). Furthermore we can calculate the total distribution cost,
p~
(1
)
c^it = ijt i i it .
With time series of w^t , p^it , c^it we can calculate the variance, the persistence, and the comovement of each one of the components of the retail price. These statistics are presented in
table 2. In this table, these statistics are computed using a few di¤erent detrending methods.
The price data, p~ijt , is nominal, so the …rst step is to remove the nominal trend. In columns
1-3, the nominal trend is removed by including a time dummy in the regression in equation
(12). In columns 4-6, the nominal trend is removed by dividing all prices by the consumer
6

The distribution margins, s , are good speci…c, but is common across all locations and time.

11

price index, and in columns 7-9, there is no nominal detrending. Comparing each set of
three columns shows that nominal detrending really doesn’t have much of an e¤ect on these
statistics. This is due to the fact that the data is taken from 13 U.S. cities over the period
1990-2005, a period when in‡ation was low and stable.
But even after taking out a nominal trend, over this period there have been shifts in relative productivity between sectors, which would lead to non-stationary relative price changes
that we would want to …lter out before using the data to calibrate a stationary model (e.g.
productivity improvements in the technology sector have led to a non-stationary fall in the
relative price of computers over this period). To account for these non-stationary shifts in
sectoral prices, we can either …lter the sectoral price data, p~ijt , using an HP …lter (with
smoothing parameter 100 for annual data) or taking …rst-di¤erences. Thus within each set
of three columns in table 2, the …rst column …lters each sectoral price with an HP …lter, the
second uses …rst-di¤erences, and the third does nothing.
The …rst thing to notice is that the wholesale goods price, p^it , is extremely volatile when
no …lter is used. This is due to non-stationary shifts in relative prices across sectors. Once
we use a …lter to remove these non-stationary shifts in relative prices, the results in the
table are largely invariant to which …lter we use. The only noticeable di¤erence is that the
…rst-order autocorrelation coe¢ cient is much lower using the …rst-di¤erenced data, but all
other statistics are largely the same. Thus in the following calibration exercise, we simply
use the …rst column, the data using the time dummy for nominal detrending and the HP
…lter for additional detrending, as the benchmark set of statistics.
Simulated method of moments are employed to …nd the combination of , d , and
that minimizes the squared distance between the moments presented in the …rst column of
table 2 and the corresponding moments from simulations of the model. These estimated
parameters are listed in the bottom four rows of table 1.
The the optimal combination of , d , and is chosen by varying all four parameters
simultaneously, but to gain some intuition about the separate role of each of these four
parameters related to the distribution sector, in tables 3 and 4 we vary one of these four
parameters, while holding the other three constant.
The e¤ect of varying the elasticity of substitution between tangible goods and distribution services, , is shown in columns 2-6 of table 3. The simulated method of moments
exercise …nds that the optimal value of is 0:02, implying that tangible goods and distribution services are nearly perfect compliments. The table reports the e¤ect of increasing
while holding all other parameters constant. As increases, there is very little change in
either the volatility or the persistence of the wage rate, w^t . However, the relative volatility
of both the wholesale price and distribution costs falls as increases. In the data, both
12

wholesale prices, p^i , and distribution costs, c^i , are about two-thirds as volatile as the wage
rate. When wholesale goods and distribution services are nearly perfect compliments, the
model is able to replicate these relative volatilities. As increases and the two become more
substitutable, these relative volatilities fall, when = 0:8, the price of wholesale goods and
the cost of distribution are both about a third as volatile as the wage rate. Hence, must be
small, implying that wholesale goods and distribution services are compliments, to replicate
the volatility of prices that we see in the data. Our estimates of a near perfect complementarity between wholesale goods and distribution services largely validates the calibration by
Burstein, Neves and Rebelo (2003), Burstein, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2007), and Corsetti,
Dedola and Leduc (2008).
In columns 7-11 of the same table we vary d , the labor share in the production of
distribution services from 0:16 to 0:56. Again we see that varying d has little e¤ect on the
volatility or persistence of the wage rate. Allowing the labor share to increase does have
some e¤ect on the relative volatilities of the wholesale price and the distribution costs, but
the major e¤ect of increasing d is in the co-movement between the wage rate and wholesale
prices or between the wage rate and distribution costs. In the data, the correlation between
the wage rate and the cost of distribution is about 0:34. When d is small, and thus there is
very little labor used in distribution, the model predicts that the co-movement between the
two should be almost 0. As d increases and thus there is more labor used in distribution,
the correlation between the two will increase. However, as d gets too big, the correlation
between the two gets too large, so to replicate the positive but modest correlation between
the wage rate and the cost of distribution, d should be about 0:36.
Similarly, in the data, the correlation between the wage rate and wholesale prices is about
0:27. In the model, when d is small, the two are nearly uncorrelated, but as d increases,
this correlation falls, but again, to replicate the negative, but modest, correlation, d should
be about 0:36.
In columns 2-6 of table 4 we vary , the elasticity of substitution between capital and
labor in the production of distribution services. Again we see that allowing to vary has little
e¤ect on the volatility or the persistence of the wage rate. However, as increases capital
and labor in distribution become more substitutable, and the relative volatilities of both the
distribution cost and the wholesale price falls. When is small, and capital and labor in
distribution are nearly perfect compliments, both distribution costs and the wholesale prices
should be about as volatile as the wage rate. When is higher and capital and labor are
closer substitutes, these two prices are about half as volatile as the wage rate, in order to
match the relative volatilities that we observe in the data, should be about 0:4.
Finally, columns 7-11 of table 4 present the results from simulation of the model where
13

, the distribution capital adjustment cost parameter varies. Again, allowing
to vary
has little e¤ect on the volatility or the persistence of the wage rate. Note that in contrast
to the other three cases in tables 3 and 4, only when we vary do we see any signi…cant
e¤ect on persistence. In the data, both the distribution cost and the wholesale price have a
…rst-order autocorrelation coe¢ cient of about 0:82. When = 0, implying that there are no
costs to adjusting the stocks of distribution capital, the persistence of these two variables is
counterfactually low. Similarly, when is low, the relative volatilities of the two prices is
too low, the correlation between the wage rate and the cost of distribution is too low, and
the correlation between the wage rate and wholesale prices is too high. In order to replicate
the moments we observe in the data, the model needs a modest investment adjustment cost
parameter of 0:18.

Shock Process

In this real business cycle model, ‡uctuations in total factor productivity drive business cycle
‡uctuations. The At and At variables in (4) are exogenous country speci…c shocks. Using
data on gross value added, total employment, and gross …xed capital formation from the
OECD’s STAN database, we estimate two series of total factor productivity for the United
States and the combination of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria,
and Finland from 1977-2007. The data is available at annual frequency, we …rst estimate
a VAR(1) with the two series using the annual data, and then we impose symmetry and
convert this annual process to a quarterly process. The resulting quarterly shock process for
the model is:
"

At+1

At

"t

where var("t ) =var("t ) = 0:12 and corr("t ; "t ) = 0:31.
This shock process assumes that TFP is the same across both the production sector
and the distribution sector within a country, as in the production functions in (4) and (5).
Alternatively we can assume that there is a separate TFP process for the distribution sector,
and thus the At in (5) is replaced with Adt . There are now four TFP processes to estimate, so
with the STAN data, instead of considering total value added, total employment, and total
capital formation in order to …nd aggregate TFP, we can consider these same series separated
into industry and service sectors. Thus using both industrial and service sector TFP for both
the U.S. and Europe, we can estimate a VAR(1) with the four TFP variables, At , At , Adt ,
and Adt . Again, this data is available at an annual frequency, so after estimating the annual

Distribution costs and the observed elasticity of substitution

The elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is de…ned as the percentage
change in relative quantities divided by the percentage change in relative prices:

If however, the price of imports relative to domestic goods at the wholesale level varies over

The model is calibrated such that , the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods and
distribution services is equal to zero. In this derivation of the observed elasticity of substitution we are using

To see this, expand the elasticity expression in (13):

Thus the change in relative quantities following a change in wholesale prices is the Armington elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods, , multiplied by the elasticity of relative prices at the consumer level with respect to changes in relative prices at the
wholesale level.8 Given the expressions for the …nal consumer prices in (3), this elasticity
can be written as:

This expression for the observed elasticity of substitution, "t , highlights the di¤erence

accumulation equations in (10) and (11). In the case with integrated markets for domestic

goods and import distribution capital, capital can be reallocated between the two within the
period, and the equality rD;t = rM;t will always hold in equilibrium. Thus the expression for
the observed elasticity of substitution becomes "t = (1 s) .
In the second case there are segmented markets for domestic good and import distribution
capital. Following the shift in the quantity demanded of imported and domestic wholesale
goods, the demand for imported goods distribution services will increase and the demand for
domestic goods distribution services will fall. Labor used in the production of distribution
services can be reallocated within the period, but distribution capital cannot be reallocated.
Thus following a change in relative wholesale prices that leads to an increased demand for
imports and a decreased demand for domestic goods, there is an excess demand for imported
goods distribution capital and an excess supply of domestic goods distribution capital. This
implies that the equilibrium cost of domestic goods distribution capital should fall and the
cost of imported goods distribution capital should rise. Thus the following inequality holds
in the short run:9
d ln

rD;t
rM;t

d ln

pD;t
pM;t

<0

Given this excess demand in one market and the excess supply in another, agents will
change their future investment plans. Investment in imported goods distribution capital will
increase and investment in domestic good distribution capital will decrease.
If there are no adjustment costs in the capital accumulation equations in (11) then plans
for investment in new domestic or import distribution capital are changed and the capital
stocks reach their new e¢ cient level in the next period. If there are capital adjustment costs
then the adjustment may be slower and it may take multiple periods to clear out any excess
demand or supply in the market for distribution services and reach a point where rD;t = rM;t .
Given this change in the relative distribution costs, in the short run "t < (1 s) , and
as time passes and capital is reallocated, "t approaches (1 s) .
The path of the observed elasticity of substitution following a productivity shock is
presented in …gure 1. The …gure presents the path of the observed elasticity of substitution,
as measured by (13) for 40 quarters following a shock in the four di¤erent cases. The solid
line in the …gure refers to the case where the Armington elasticity of substitution between
home and foreign goods is equal to 4 and there is no distribution sector. The dashed line
line in the …gure refers to the case the Armington elasticity is equal to 0:9 and there is
9

Empirically, Goldberg and Campa (2010) …nd that following a 1% exchange rate depreciation that results
in a 1% increase in the price of foreign currency denominated imports at the dock, the distribution cost of

no distribution sector. The dotted line refers to the case where the Armington elasticity is
equal to 8 but distribution costs make up approximately 50% of the …nal cost of a good,
and the markets for the two types of distribution capital are integrated. The line with stars
refers to the case where the Armington elasticity is equal to 8 but distribution costs make
up approximately 50% of the …nal cost of a good, and the markets for the two types of
distribution capital are segmented.
In the two cases where there is no distribution sector the observed elasticity of substitution
is simply equal to the Armington elasticity. When there is a distribution sector but the
markets for distribution capital are integrated the observed elasticity is simply a constant
and proportional to the Armington elasticity, "t = (1 s) :
When the markets for the two types of distribution capital are segmented, the observed
elasticity is initially close to zero since distribution capital is a state variable and cannot
be instantaneously reallocated from the domestic goods sector to the imported goods sector
(the reason it isn’t exactly zero is that some labor can be shifted into distribution in the
high demand sector, but since the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in the
distribution sector is low, the bene…ts of this labor reallocation are small). Agents cannot
reallocate existing capital but can change investment plans subject to investment adjustment
costs, so over time capital in one sector is allowed to depreciate without replacement while the
stock of distribution capital increases in the other. Over time, as the stocks of distribution
capital change, the observed substitutability between home and foreign goods increases.

4.2

Impulse Responses

The responses of home and foreign GDP and its components to a positive home TFP shock
are presented in …gures 2 and 3. Figure 2 presents the responses of home and foreign GDP
and investment under four cases mentioned earlier, where the Armington elasticity, , is
equal to 4 and the distribution margin is equal to 0, where the Armington elasticity is equal
to 0:9 and the distribution margin is equal to 0, where the Armington elasticity is equal to 8,
the distribution margin is set to 50% and there are no frictions in the market for distribution
capital, and where the Armington elasticity is equal to 8, the distribution margin is set to
50% and there are frictions in the market for distribution capital. Figure 3 does the same
for consumption and net exports.
For the case where the elasticity is equal to 4 but there is no distribution sector, the
…gures show the familiar result for an international real business cycle model with complete
international asset markets and a high degree of substitutability between home and foreign
goods. Following a productivity shock in the home country, there is a sharp increase in home

18

investment demand. The foreign country does not have the same increase in investment
demand and any increase in foreign investment is tempered in order to ship goods to fuel
the productivity induced investment boom in the home country. Thus in the immediate
aftermath of the shock, before the bene…ts of the shock in terms of increased home production
are felt, the home country runs a current account de…cit and the foreign country runs a
current account surplus.
Within a few quarters there is a reversal in the current account as the higher production
leads to increased saving in the home country, some of this increased savings is shipped
abroad in the form of high home current account surpluses. Thus after the …rst few quarters,
the home country runs a large and persistent current account surplus and the foreign country
runs a large and persistent de…cit.
The current account dynamics change in signi…cant ways when home and foreign goods
are less substitutable. When the elasticity of substitution is equal to 0:9, the foreign goods
can’t as easily be used to fuel a home country investment boom, so there is more of an increase
in foreign investment in the aftermath of the shock. Furthermore, once the increased home
productivity leads to an increase in home production and home saving, foreign agents can’t
as easily consume the bene…ts of the productivity fueled boom in the home country and thus
do not run large current account de…cits when substitutability is low.
The responses from the model with a distribution sector but no frictions in distribution
are very similar to the responses when the Armington elasticity is equal to 4. In both cases,
home and foreign goods are highly substitutable, and the output from one country can easily
be consumed in the other country, leading to a large a persistent current account surplus in
the country that experiences the positive productivity shock.
The responses from the model with a distribution sector and frictions in distribution are
very similar to the responses when the Armington elasticity is equal to 0:9. The observed
long-run elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods may be equal to 4, but in
the short run, home and foreign goods are poor substitutes. The …gure shows that there is
more of an increase in foreign investment in the immediate aftermath of the shock as foreign
goods are not as easily diverted for use in the home country investment boom. Furthermore,
without adequate distribution channels, foreign agents cannot as easily substitute the excess
production from the home country for their own goods, so foreign agents import less and
run a smaller trade de…cit.
Following a shock to productivity in one country, prices and quantities need to adjust to
restore equilibrium. Figures 2 and 3 show that when there is low substitutability between
home and foreign goods, there is not much response to net exports following a shock, so it

19

must be that most of the burden of adjustment falls on international relative prices.10
Figure 4 shows the responses of the home country terms of trade and the real exchange
rate following a positive home TFP shock. When the technological elasticity of substitution
is equal to 4 and there is no distribution sector there is little movement in either the terms
of trade or net exports following a shock. This is also true when there is a distribution
sector, but there are no frictions in distribution. When the elasticity of substitution is equal
to 0:9, there is much more movement in both the terms of trade and the real exchange
rate. Similarly when the Armington elasticity of substitution is equal to 8 but there are
frictions in distribution there is signi…cant movement in both the terms of trade and the real
exchange rate following the shock. Thus when there are distribution costs and a distribution
sector that is slow to adjust, the economy with a high elasticity of substitution acts a lot
like the economy with a low elasticity of substitution, following a shock, quantity variables
like like exports and imports cannot adjust quickly to restore equilibrium, so the burden of
adjustment falls on prices like the terms of trade and the real exchange rate.

4.3

Volatility and co-movement of certain macro variables

The standard deviation and co-movement of GDP, the components of GDP, and international
prices like the terms of trade and the real exchange rate are listed in table 5. The …rst column
of the table lists these moments calculated from U.S. data. The data is quarterly from 1984
to 2007. The rest of the table presents these moments as calculated from simulations of
the model. In the …rst four columns from simulations of the model (Model 1), exports and
imports (and thus net exports and GDP) are measured with prices that are allowed to vary
over the cycle. Exports and imports are measured with constant (steady-state) prices in the
last four columns of the table (Model 2).
The simulations of the model are conducted under the four alternative parameterizations
that were used in the impulse response analysis. The table shows that when the Armington
elasticity is equal to 4 and there is no distribution sector, simulations of the model yield too
little volatility in both consumption and international prices like the terms of trade or the
real exchange rate, a positive co-movement between output and net exports, a low crosscountry co-movement in production side variables like output, investment and employment,
and a high cross-country co-movement in consumption.
These features of the model where shown earlier in the impulse response analysis. Following a positive shock in one country, the country that experienced the positive shock can
10

A similar argument (but one that relied on incomplete pass-through to explain the low substitutability)
is given in Devereux and Engel (2002) to explain the high volatility of exchange rates that we observe in the
data.

20

easily export their surplus production to the less productive country. This leads to too much
consumption smoothing, and since quantities adjust so easily in order to clear markets internationally, there is not much movement in either the terms of trade or the real exchange rate.
The high substitutability of home and foreign goods means that agents are willing to change
the composition of their consumption basket and take advantage of productivity di¤erentials across countries to maximize total consumption, and this results in a low cross-country
correlation in production and a high cross-country correlation in consumption.
When the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is 0:9, the low
substitutability between home and foreign goods means that the country that experiences
a positive shock cannot as easily export their surplus production to the foreign country.
This implies that net exports are less volatile and consumption is more volatile. Lower
substitutability means that production responsibilities cannot as easily be "shared" between
countries, so cross-country output co-movement is higher and cross-country consumption
co-movement is lower. Given that home and foreign goods are not as easily substitutable,
international prices like the real exchange rate and the terms of trade must move more to
restore equilibrium following a shock.
In the version of the model where the Armington elasticity of substitution between home
and foreign goods is equal to 8, there is a distribution sector, and there exists one integrated
market for both domestic and import distribution capital, the volatility and co-movement
from simulations of the model are very close to the moments predicted from the model with
the high Armington elasticity. There is a distribution sector in this version of the model,
but since distribution capital can be reallocated within the period, there are no frictions to
limit the substitutability of home and foreign goods in the short run.
In the version of the model where the Armington elasticity of substitution between home
and foreign goods is equal to 8, there is a distribution sector, and there are frictions in
distribution due to the segmented markets for domestic and import distribution capital, the
volatility and co-movement from simulations of the model are very close to the moments
from the model with the low Armington elasticity. Even though the Armington elasticity
is high, since distribution channels cannot be adjusted quickly following a shock, at short
horizons home and foreign goods are much less substitutable. As a result, net exports are
not very volatile, and the model can replicate the high volatility of the real exchange rate
and the terms of trade even when the observed long-run elasticity of substitution between
home and foreign goods is equal to 4 (" = (1 s)). Since home and foreign goods are
poor substitutes in the short run, there is less consumption smoothing, lower cross-country
consumption correlation, and higher cross-country correlation in output, investment and
employment.
21

In the last four columns of the table exports and imports are measured with constant
(steady state) prices. In the main results, when exports and imports are measured with
current prices, there is the possibility that changes in the moments of GDP and net exports
are not due to an actual change in quantities but are simply due to movements in the terms
of trade. Measuring exports and imports with constant prices removes this possibility.11
The table shows that measuring exports and imports with constant prices has little e¤ect
on most variables in the model. None of the variances or co-movements involving GDP, net
exports, exports, or imports are signi…cantly a¤ected. The volatility of exports and imports
drops when measured with constant prices. The key result, that the model with frictions in
the distribution margin can reproduce many of the short-run business cycle moments that
we see in a model with a low Armington elasticity, still holds when exports and imports are
measured with constant prices. Thus these frictions in distribution are a¤ecting export and
import volumes, not simply prices.
4.3.1

The S-curve

As discussed in Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1994), the contemporaneous correlation between international relative prices like the terms of trade or the real exchange rate and net
exports is low and maybe even negative, and the last two rows of table 5 show that the correlation between the terms of trade and net exports or between the real exchange rate and
net exports is negative in the United States. Furthermore, the table shows that simulations
of the model where the Armington elasticity is equal to 4 yields a high contemporaneous
correlation between relative prices and net exports. In the model, when there is a depreciation in the real exchange rate or the terms of trade that makes home goods relatively less
expensive than goods produced abroad, there is an instantaneous improvement in the trade
balance.
The table shows that when home and foreign goods are less substitutable, the contemporaneous correlation between relative prices and net exports falls. The model with a low
substitutability between home and foreign goods predicts that the contemporaneous correlation between the terms of trade and net exports is about 0:36.
The version of the model with a distribution sector but no frictions in distribution also
leads to a very high correlation between these international relative prices and net exports,
re‡ecting the high elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods. On the other
hand, the model with frictions in distribution can replicate negative correlation between the
real exchange rate and net exports. In this model, even though the Armington elasticity
11

Kehoe and Ruhl (2008) show how movements in the terms of trade can potentially have a large e¤ect
on business cycle moments in model simulations.

22

is high, frictions in the distribution sector ensure that home and foreign goods are poor
substitutes in the short run.12
Backus et al. go on to describe the S-curve. The fact that the correlation between the
terms of trade at time t and net exports at time t+n looks like a horizontal letter S as n goes
from some negative integer to some positive integer. Most importantly, the S-curve shows
the fact that the contemporaneous correlation between net exports and international relative
prices is negative, but the correlation between relative prices today and net exports at time
t + n is positive for some positive n, implying that the immediate impact of an exchange
rate depreciation may be a fall in the trade balance, but a depreciation eventually leads to
an increase in net exports.
This S-like relationship between relative prices like the real exchange rate or the terms
of trade and lags or leads of net exports is presented in …gure 5. The …gure shows the
correlation between relative prices at time t and net exports at time t + n as observed in the
data for the United States and the Euro Area, and as predicted by the four versions of the
model.
As observed from the S-curves in the data, the correlation between relative prices at
time t and net exports at time t + n is increasing as n increases. Thus there is a negative
contemporaneous correlation between either the terms of trade or the real exchange rate
and the current value of net exports, but this correlation increases for future values of net
exports. When the Armington elasticity is equal to 4 and there is no distribution sector, or
when there is a distribution sector but no frictions in distribution, the model cannot replicate
this …nding. Counterfactually the model …nds that the correlation between relative prices at
time t and net exports at time t + n falls as n increases.
However, when the short-run substitutability of home and foreign goods is low, either
because the Armington elasticity is low or because frictions in the distribution sector hamper
substitutability in the short run, the model can replicate the fact that the correlation between
relative prices at time t and net exports at time t + n starts at an initially low level and
increases as n increases.
12

The fact that the contemporaneous correlation between the terms of trade and the trade balance may be
positive or negative is related to the famous Marshall-Lerner condition. When there is a depreciation in the
terms of trade, the relative price of imports increases, this means that the quantity demanded of imports will
certainly fall and the quantity demanded of a country’s exports will certainly rise. Thus when measuring net
exports with constant (steady-state) prices, there will certainly be a positive correlation between the terms
of trade and the trade balance, as shown in the results for Model-2. However, when we use current prices
to calculate the trade balance, the relative price of imports may increase, and thus the quantity demanded
of imports will fall, but if the import demand elasticity is less than 1 then the fall in quantity demanded is
not as great as the rise in the price, so the total spending on imports will actually increase, resulting in a
negative contemporaneous correlation between the terms of trade and the trade balance.

23

4.3.2

Separate shocks in the production and distribution sectors

The results presented so far have assumed that both the production and distribution sectors
within a country are a¤ected by the same country-speci…c TFP shock. This was done
to ensure that the results from the model without the distribution sector could be easily
compared with the results from the model with a distribution sector. However, as mentioned
in section 3, it may be more realistic to assume that within each country there are two shocks,
a production sector shock, At , that a¤ects the manufacturing sector, and a service sector
shock, Adt , that a¤ects the distribution sector. We use data from the OECD’s STAN database
to calculate country and sector speci…c TFP processes for both the manufacturing sector and
the service sector, and the results from the estimation of this VAR(1) process with these four
shocks was presented in section 3.
The results from simulations of this model are presented in table 6. Now the comparison
between the model with no distribution sector and the model with a distribution sector is
not as easy. Since the shocks to the production sector are more volatile than shocks to the
services sector, it is not as clear-cut to compare a model where all of the economy is engaged
in manufacturing to one where half is manufacturing and half is distribution.
That said, in the model with both sector- and country-speci…c shocks, most of the same
features of the model with only country-speci…c shocks continue to hold. Namely the fact
that in the model with a high elasticity of substitution, consumption volatility will be counterfactually low, the volatility of the terms of trade and the real exchange rate will be too low,
cross-country GDP co-movement will be too low, and cross-country consumption correlation
will be too high. These key failings of the model were brought on by the fact that home and
foreign goods were too highly substitutable, and thus home and foreign agents could too easily smooth consumption following a county-speci…c shock. The model with both sector- and
country-speci…c TFP shocks can still lead to key improvements in the ability of the model
to match the data since frictions in the distribution sector still hamper the substitutability
of home and foreign goods in the short run.

Summary and Conclusion

In the international macro literature a low elasticity of substitution between home and
foreign goods is needed to explain short business cycle ‡uctuations, particularly movements
in international relative price and the real exchange rate. At the same time the international
trade literature estimates a high value for this elasticity using data on the longer term change
in trade patterns following a changes in relative prices.

24

This paper presents a model that can explain these two apparently contradictory results.
The true elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is high, like in the trade
literature. However in the short run there are frictions in distribution that makes home and
foreign goods appear much less substitutable in the short run. The model is parameterized
to produce this high long-term elasticity, but simulations of the model show that in the
short run it behaves like an international macro model parameterized with a low elasticity
of substitution. Speci…cally, the model is able to replicate the short-run volatility of the
real exchange rate and the terms of trade. The model can also replicate the negative comovement between relative prices and both GDP and net exports while still maintaining the
high long-run substitutability that would satisfy the international trade literature.

Data Appendix - Not for publication

The EIU dataset used for the calibration of parameters speci…c to the distribution sector
contains the prices of over 300 goods from 123 cities. These prices are available annually
from 1990-2005. We excluded goods that were non-tradable to very close to non-tradeable.
We then combined the goods into four sectors: Grocery Items, Non-food consumer goods,
clothing, and transportation. In addition, Crucini and Landry (2012) provide data on the
distribution margin, calculated from input-output tables, for each good in the dataset. The
list of goods we use and their grouping into one of the four categories is as follows:

Figure 1: Observed Elasticity of Substitution following a TFP shock. In the solid line
the structural elasticity is equal to 4 and there is no distribution. In the dashed line the
structural elasticity is equal to 0.9 and there is no distribution. In the dotted line the
structural elasticity is equal to 8, there is a distribution sector, but distribution capital can
be instantaneously reallocated from distribution of domestic goods to the distribution of
imports, and vice versa. In the line with stars the structural elasticity is equal to 8, there
is a distribution sector, but frictions prevent the reallocation of distribution inputs in the
short run.
