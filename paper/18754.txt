ABSTRACT
In generating fast economic growth, China is also generating growing concern about its environmental
record. Using 2000-2009 data, we find that, while spending on environmental infrastructure has visible
positive environmental impact, city spending is strongly tilted towards transportation infrastructure.
Investment in transportation infrastructure correlates strongly with both real GDP growth, a measure
of tangible economic growth relevant to city-level Party and government cadres’ promotion odds,
and with land prices, which affect city governments’ revenues from land lease sales. In contrast, city
governments’ spending on environmental improvements is at best uncorrelated with cadres’ promotion
odds, and is uncorrelated with local GDP growth and land prices. These findings suggest that, were
environmental quality explicitly linked to a cadre’s chance of promotion, or were environmental quality
to affect land prices substantially, city-level public investment in environmental improvement would
rise.

Introduction

China’s phenomenal economic growth in recent decades is widely thought to be related to the
Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) management of the economy. An important aspect of the
Party’s management system is arguably a merit-based promotion for Party and government
officials, whom we call cadres for brevity. In this system, merit can be demonstrated by having
overseen tangible economic development (e.g., see Maskin, Qian and Xu (2000) for evidence on
the central committee level, Li and Zhou (2005) and Chen, Li and Zhou (2005) for evidence on
the provincial level, and Edin (2003) and Whiting (2004) for evidence on selected
towns/villages).1
The alleged critical role of this system in China’s economic success motivates our
adoption of an “organizational management” focus: namely, that organizational performance
emerges from individuals’ behavioural responses to their incentives, given their decision rights
and budgetary resources (Jensen, 1998).

Applying this logic, we relate city-governments’

investment in transportation infrastructure versus environmental improvements to cadres’
hierarchical assignment of duties, promotion incentives, and budgetary constraints.
This exercise focuses on institutional details about China’s hierarchic management
system. The apex of this system is the CCP politburo and central committee. Below them are
the top cadres of China’s provinces and its four “province-level” municipalities.2 Beneath these
are, in descending order, the top cadres of cities, counties, and townships or villages. Cadres are

1

The literature is not unanimous on this point. For example, Shih, Adolph and Liu (2012) find no significant
correlation between CCP central committee members’ promotions and economic growth performance; consistent
other factors, such as factional ties with current and past top leaders assuming greater importance at very senior
levels in the Party hierarchy.

The four “province-level municipalities” (zhi xia shi) are Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing. These are
directly under the Central Government and with jurisdiction over a city and adjacent districts.

rotated – reassigned to a new position every three or more years, and perhaps to new locations as
well. Conditional on a harmonious political attitude, a cadre’s past performance, evidenced by
having overseen high tangible economic development outcomes, is shown to affect his odds of
promotion (Maskin, Qian and Xu, 2000; Edin, 2003; Whiting, 2004; Li and Zhou, 2005; Chen,
Li and Zhou, 2005).

This arguably merit-based promotion system is thought to induce a

competition between sub-national governments to produce tangible evidence of economic
development at all levels of the management hierarchy.
This competition is thought to take place within China’s highly decentralized fiscal
expenditure system. The World Bank’s (2012) China 2030 report states that “sub-national
governments account for around 80 percent of total budgetary expenditures and bear
responsibility for the provision of vital public services including basic health and education,
pensions, unemployment insurance, and minimum income support.” Sub-national governments,
primarily city governments, also account for the lion’s share of investment in urban
infrastructure, such as transportation systems and environmental improvements. However, city
government revenues, based on a “tax revenue sharing mechanism and intergovernmental fiscal
transfers, are not commensurate with local government expenditure responsibilities” (World
Bank 2012, p. 55). City governments must therefore find additional revenue sources to finance
their expenditures.
This mismatch could affect top city-level cadres’ investment and revenue raising
decisions. To the extent that their careers depend on tangible evidence of having successfully
fostered economic growth, the governments they direct are apt to allocate public expenditures
according to their short-run contributions to tangible economic growth, rather than their long-run

2

tangible and intangible contributions to total growth.

Figure 1 illustrates how these

considerations might play out in a local government’s allocation of investment between
transportation infrastructure and environmental improvements. Transportation infrastructure
readily contributes to tangible growth because construction activity elevates measures of
economic activity immediately.

Also transportation infrastructure raises land prices and local governments raise revenue
by selling long-term land leases to real estate development enterprises. These considerations
plausibly incline local government and Party cadres, seeking to expand their discretionary
spending budgets, to allocate more city funds to transportation infrastructure and less to
environmental improvements. Like considerations might similarly direct local public spending
away from other relatively intangible investments, such as education and healthcare.

Another possible reason for an emphasis on transportation infrastructure spending might
be the CCPs longstanding technocratic interpretation of economic development as requiring
megaprojects – dams, highways, and other monumental achievements. Huge transportation
projects arguably fill this bill better than green spaces, sewage treatment facilities, or chimney
scrubbers.

Our empirical tests lead us to five basic conclusions. First, city-level environmental
investment is statistically and economically significantly correlated with better environmental
outcomes.

Second, city-level cadres increase city government transportation infrastructure

investment in response to their province-level superiors emphasizing such investment, but do not
act likewise if their superiors emphasize environmental concerns. Third, higher transportation
infrastructure spending is, while higher environmental spending is not, correlated with higher
3

land prices in the short term; higher land lease revenues in turn raise future spending on
transportation infrastructure.

Fourth, current spending on transportation infrastructure is

correlated with next year’s GDP growth while spending on environment is not. Finally, higher
city-level GDP growth is statistically and economically significantly positively related to greater
odds of the city’s top cadres being promoted. On the contrary, higher city-level environmental
investment is statistically and economically significantly negatively related to better odds of the
city’s top cadres being promoted.
Obviously, determining China’s socially optimal public spending formula lies far beyond
the scope of this study. The Chinese people may indeed have a collective preference for rapid
income growth and transportation infrastructure spending first, and other aspects of
development, such as environmental improvements, later.

Nonetheless, the findings offer

suggestions as to how the CCP might promote intangible development goals, such as clean air
and water, should it choose to prioritize such goals.

Equally obviously, our findings reveal correlations, not causes. We lack any credible
means of explicitly confirming what causes what. However, these issues are unlikely to alter our
basic argument: city-level cadres prefer to invest in transportation infrastructure which has a
stronger positive correlation with near-term tangible growth, which in turn is related to higher
promotion odds. Or, this emphasis might reflect a lingering traditional central planning obsession
with megaprojects, such as transportation infrastructure. In addition, investing in transportation
infrastructure boosts land prices, which boost cities’ revenues from land sales, which increases
top city-level cadres’ discretionary spending powers.

4

These are prima facia plausible

explanations of the correlations we find; however, we welcome alternative interpretations of our
empirical findings.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section documents citylevel transportation infrastructure and environmental improvement spending from 2000 to 2009;
and also shows public spending on environmental improvements to correlate positively with air
quality.

This is consistent with spending on environmental improvements alleviating air

pollution. Section III presents empirical evidence consistent with urban infrastructure spending
being constrained by revenues from land lease sales and favouring transportation over
environmental improvements; with two appearing to be substitutes. Section IV presents findings
consistent with investment in transportation directly affecting economic growth and also exerting
an indirect effect by raising land lease revenues and thus loosening local governments’ budget
constraints. This section also replicates prior results consistent with cadres’ promotion odds
rising with measures of tangible economic growth. Section V concludes.

China’s urban infrastructure investment and air quality

2.1

Decreasing environmental investment in the early 2000s

Upon Mr. Hu Jintao assuming the top position in the CCP and China in 2002, the “Scientific
Outlook on Development (ke xue fa zhan guan)” became a major principle of social and
economic development. The importance of environmental protection was repeatedly emphasized
by the central government, just like it currently is in the 12th Five Year Plan.

5

However, during this era, local governments actually allocated less resources to urban
environmental improvements, such as “drainage and sewage purification”, “environmental
sanitation and solid waste treatment”, and “gardening and greening”. Figure 2 shows that, at the
national level, environmental improvement investment as a fraction of total urban infrastructure
investment gradually dropped from a peak of 25.4% in 2000 to the nadir of 19.1% in 2006,
before recovering slightly to 21.3% in 2009.

Figure 2 shows environmental improvement

investment over GDP similarly dropping from a peak of 0.58% in 2003 to a low of 0.41% in
2007, and then rising again somewhat.
This contrasts starkly with infrastructure investment in urban transportation, including
“roads and bridges” and “public transportation”, also plotted in Figures 2. Over the same decade,
transportation infrastructures as a share of total urban infrastructure investment rose from 60.2%
in 2000 to 72.7% in 2010. Transportation infrastructure over GDP likewise jumped from 0.90%
in 2000 to 1.71% in 2003, and then fluctuated around 1.50% until the 2009 stimulus.3

2.2

Pollution is an important problem

Pollution, especially air pollution, is a serious problem – obvious to any visitor to any large
Chinese city (World Bank, 2007, 2012). For example, in early December 2011, air quality

3

Besides the three components grouped as environmental improvement investments and the two components
grouped as transportation infrastructure investments, five other components are reported in Ministry of Housing and
Urban-Rural Development’s urban infrastructure investment statistics. Below, we exclude “centralized heating” and
“flood control” because these are significant only in certain cities; and the component “other” because its definition
is opaque. The final two components, “water supply” and “gas supply”, both correspond to basic necessaries, and
thus arguably lie outside the emphasis of this study. Nevertheless, including total investment in water and gas
supply (normalized by GDP) as a control variable generates qualitatively similar results, defined as identical patterns
of signs and significance and comparable point estimates.

reached a “crisis” level in Beijing, attracting global media attention. 4 On Dec 5th, the US
Embassy reported particulate air pollution in Beijing exceeding the standard scale’s maximum of
500, and described the situation as “crazily bad”. The media also reported that the pollution
brought a rush of patients to hospitals during those weeks, most suffering from heart attacks or
respiratory problems. These dramatic visible air pollution problems resurfaced again in Jan 2013.
Air quality problems persisted through most of the past decade. Since mid-2000, the
Ministry of Environmental Protection has graded air quality in selected cities. Table 1 shows the
annual mean and median fractions of days with the highest grade, calculated across all cities,
beginning to rise only in 2008, the year Beijing hosted the Olympic Games. This improvement
is only partially due to the ministry expanding its coverage to include more cities. Panel B, using
only the 37 cities covered throughout the sample period, also shows an improvement only after
2008.

2.3

Environmental investment and environmental outcomes

Investing in environmental improvements plausibly improves air quality both immediately and in
future years. If so, China’s skimping on investment in environmental improvements through the
past decade could accumulate into its current poor air quality problem.
To investigate this, Table 2 examines data from 2001 to 2009 for the 82 cities whose air
quality the Ministry of Environmental Protection graded each day. (The four “province-level”
“Victory for U.S. Embassy as Beijing Chokes on ‘Heavy Fog’”, Wall Street Journal, December 5, 2011; “Flights
Grounded in China as Smog Worsens”, Financial Times, December 5, 2011; “Outrage Grows over Air Pollution
and China’s Response”, New York Times, December 6, 2011; “China’s Pollution Data Shrouded in Official Fog”,
Bloomberg BusinessWeek, December 8, 2011; “Death-by-Air in Beijing Shows China’s Heart Risk from Worsening

Street Journal, December 16, 2011.

mega cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing are excluded.)5 Each city’s change in
air quality each year is the fraction of days in which it earned a top “Grade I” in air quality less
the same fraction the prior year. 6 Table 2 regresses this on “environmental development,”
defined as annual urban infrastructure investment in environmental improvements scaled by
local GDP.7 Investment in transportation infrastructures is also included for comparison. In
addition, the regressions control for lagged air quality level and city fixed-effects. The
regressions also include real growth in per capita GDP and its cross term with the lagged real per
capita GDP level to capture any Kuznets curve effect (Stern, Common and Barbier, 1996; Stern,
2004). Including year fixed-effects generates qualitatively similar results – by which we mean
an identical pattern of signs and significance levels and comparable point estimates. Because air
quality in a city may be affected by pollution in surrounding cities and regions, we follow Zheng,
Cao and Kahn (2011) in constructing a proxy for air quality changes in nearby cities: the
weighted average of the changes in the ratios of days reaching “Grade I” air quality in all other
cities that year, weighted by the reciprocal of the exponential function of the distance to that city.
Finally, lagged FDI, normalized by GDP, is also introduced to control for any effect of foreign
investment on air quality of the sort found by Copeland and Taylor (2004). Significance tests in
the tables cluster residuals by province. The definitions and sources of these variables are listed
in the appendix.

We exclude these data for several reasons. First, because these cities are “province-level” administrative units,
their top government and Party officials are considered to be top provincial government and Party cadres, and thus
to have promotion possibilities not comparable to those of top cadres in other cities. Second, the four cities are
much larger and more developed than most other cities during the sample period. Finally, unique occasions – most
notably, the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the 2010 Expo in Shanghai – affect data for those cities.
6
Regressions using the fraction of “Grade I” days, rather than its first difference, as the dependent variable generate
qualitatively similar results.
7
The tables normalize by local GDP in the same year. Normalizing by population – that is, using per capita
investment on environmental improvement, etc. – generates qualitatively similar results throughout. We relegate
these to a footnote because China’s official population figures account poorly for migrants, and thus may induce a
bias associated with the net internal migration if used as a scaling factor.

8

Table 2 reveals a positive and significant correlation between environmental investment
and better air quality in both the concurrent year and two years in the future. Using the
coefficient in column 3, a one standard deviation increase in environmental investment correlates
with a 1.03 percent larger fraction of days reaching “Grade I” in the same year, and with a 1.19
percent increase two years later. 8 These marginal effects are economically significant: on
average, the fraction of days reaching “Grade I” increases by only 0.86 percent per year, so a one
standard deviation increase in environmental investment correlates with a better than doubling of
the baseline improvement trajectory. In contrast, investment in transportation infrastructure is
uncorrelated with air quality improvement.
The coefficients on the control variables are unsurprising. Per capita GDP growth is
significantly negative, while its cross-term with lagged per capita GDP is significantly positive,
tracing out the U-shaped relationship between air quality and local economic growth of an
environmental Kuznets curve. Calculated using column (1), the turning point corresponds to a
per capita GDP of about ¥127.3 thousand (in constant 2009 RMB). In the sample data, a few of
the most developed Chinese cities approach this point. Nearby cities’ air quality attracts a
positive coefficient, but is not uniformly significant; consistent with the finding of Zheng, Cao
and Kahn (2011) that local factors are predominant determinants of air quality in China. The
FDI variable is insignificant.
As Table 1 shows, the number of cities graded for air quality increased between 2001 and
2005, so the panel in column (1) through (3) is unbalanced. If cities that entered the data late

8

For the 86 cities with air quality information, the standard deviation of investment in environmental improvements
(normalized by local GDP) is 0.417 during the sample period. Together with the coefficients in Table 2 (column 3),
this implies a one standard deviation increase in environmental investment corresponds to 0.417 × 0.0247 = 0.0103
(1.03 percent) increase in the dependent variable during the same year, and to a 0.417 × 0.0286 = 0.0119 (1.19
percent) increase two years later.

9

have systematically different pollution problems, our results might be affected. Columns (4) to
(6) therefore use only data from 2005 on: a balanced panel containing the same cities each year.
Qualitatively similar results ensue; indeed environmental development variable becomes more
significant.
Reverse causality seems implausible in these regressions. That city officials would wait
until their air quality has improved to invest in environmental improvements seems prima facie
implausible.

That some unknown latent factor causes both investment in environmental

improvement and improves air quality through some other channel, such as closing pollution
intensive SOEs, is possible.

3.

Infrastructure spending

3.1

Local government responsibility for urban infrastructure expenditures

The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development’s “China Urban Construction Statistics
Yearbook” declares local (city) governments to be primarily responsible for urban infrastructure
investment.

Figure 4 shows that government spending accounting for 26.9% of all urban

infrastructure investments in 2009, and most of this to be by local governments. In contrast, the
central government only contributed about 1.1% of total urban infrastructure investments.
Enterprise spending accounts for another 23.8%; and most infrastructure enterprises are SOEs
controlled by local governments. Local governments can also use debt financing, either on their
own balance sheets or on those of SOEs they control, to magnify their budgets. In 2009, bank
loans and bonds to local governments provided funds for 39.7% of urban infrastructure

10

investments. Thus, the lion’s share of urban infrastructure investment is directed by local
governments, or more precisely, by their top cadres.9

3.2

City government investment and superiors’ “emphasis”

Because local governments are preeminent in infrastructure development, their top cadres’
budget constraints and incentives are important. After a 1994 public finance reform, the central
government collects a large proportion of tax revenue and then allots funds to subsidiary levels
of government. For most local governments, this allotment is designed to cover only basic
operating expenses (chi fan cai zheng). Local governments therefore must access off-budget
financing to fund urban infrastructure. Most of this is either borrowing – that is, bank loans or
bond issues – or revenue from the sale of long-term land leases to property development
enterprises.
The CCP’s management system entrusts public spending decisions at each level of
government to that level’s top cadres. China’s merit-based management system is based on their
decisions being shaped by their incentives for career advancement. Because we study city-level
data, we focus on the preferences of Party Secretaries of provincial CCP Committees (sheng wei
shu ji), whose recommendations affect the careers of top city-level cadres (mayors and city Party
Secretaries) in their provinces. Obviously, we cannot observe Provincial CCP Secretaries’
preferences; however, we can make plausible inferences about them from their public records.

9

The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development does not disaggregate funding by usage, so data for, e.g.
transportation infrastructure investment versus environmental improvement investment, are not available.

11

The 27 provinces we study were governed by a total of 82 provincial CCP Secretaries
from 2000 to 2009. An annual index of their preference regarding infrastructure investment is
constructed as follows. An internet search by the name and title of each provincial CCP
Secretary yields a total number of hits. This is the denominator of the index. A second set of
searches, each run within these hits, identifies webpages that also contain relevant keywords that
might occur in these top cadres’ speeches and articles: “infrastructure (ji chu she shi)” or “urban
development (cheng shi jian she)” to flag urban infrastructure investments, “transportation (jiao
tong)” to flag transportation related urban infrastructure investments, and “environmental
protection (huan bao or huan jing bao hu)” to flag urban environmental infrastructure
investments. (Note that, in Chinese, the terms for transportation and environmental protection
are not implicitly subcategories of “infrastructure”). Dividing the number of hits each from these
three joint searches by the denominator yields annual indexes for each provincial CCP
secretary’s connections with each of infrastructure investment in general, transportation
infrastructure investment, and environmental improvement investment. We interpret each index
as reflecting the importance a provincial CCP Secretary assigns to investment in infrastructure in
general, transportation infrastructure, and environmental improvements, respectively, that year.10
The panel averages of the three indices are 0.16 for infrastructure investment, 0.29 for
“transportation infrastructure investment” and 0.22 for “environmental improvement investment.”
Thus, provincial CCP Secretaries on average emphasize transportation more than the
environment, at least in their on-line coverage.

Zheng et al (2012) uses a similar methodology to construct an internet search-based index of developers’
emphasis on the energy-efficiency of their housing developments in China.
10

12

China’s hierarchical management system turns on city-level cadres, aspiring for promotion,
pursuing investment policies in harmony with goals their provincial Party Secretaries emphasize.
To explore this, we utilize data for 283 of China’s 287 city-level (di ji shi) governments from
2000 through 2009, again excluding the four “province-level” cities.

Table 3 presents

regressions of city-level investment in transportation infrastructures and environmental
improvements, both scaled by local GDP in the same year, on one-year lagged values of three
proxies for local government budget constraints, budgetary allocation from the central
government, revenues from land sales, and outstanding debt, all normalized by local GDP in the
same year, and the lagged internet search-based index on provincial CCP Secretaries’ priorities.
The regressions also control for lagged values of real per capita GDP, FDI, investment other than
urban infrastructure, and government expenditures, all normalized by local GDP. City fixedeffects are also included, and found to be jointly significant in Hausman tests. Standard error
estimates are clustered by province. More detailed descriptions of the variables are available in
the appendix.
Table 3 reveals cities’ budgetary allocations from the central government to be unrelated
to investment in transportation or environmental improvements. This is consistent with those
allocations being used for their official purpose – funding basic services. In contrast, revenue
from land sales is significantly positive in explaining transportation infrastructure investment.
The coefficient in column (1) implies that a one standard deviation increase in land sales revenue
corresponds to a 0.14 percentage point increase (2.398 × 0.057 ≈ 0.137) in transportation
investment as a fraction of local GDP the following year, which is equivalent of about 15.3% of
mean transportation investment over GDP in the sample period. However, land sales revenue is
unrelated to environmental investment. Similarly, loan balances are positively and marginally

13

significantly related to transportation infrastructure investment, but insignificant in
environmental investment regressions.
These results are consistent with local governments using revenues from land auctions
and, less clearly, from loans to finance transportation infrastructure, but not environmental
improvements. A reverse causality scenario would have governments collected more revenues
from land sales in the past because land leasers anticipated more investment in transportation
infrastructure. This is plausible, for better transportation infrastructure might elevate land prices,
thereby increasing local governments’ land sales proceeds.
The lagged proxies for provincial Party Secretaries’ priorities, the internet search indexes,
reveal their emphasizing infrastructure to be positive and marginally significant in explaining
transportation infrastructure investment, but negative and insignificant in explaining
environmental investment. Provincial-level cadres’ emphasizing transportation infrastructure
investment likewise correlates marginally significantly positively with spending on
transportation infrastructure (column 2).

In contrast, the index gauging provincial cadres’

emphasis on the environment is negative and marginally significant in explaining spending on
environmental investment (column 4).
These findings are consistent with province-level cadres’ calls for infrastructure
investment motivating city-level cadres to spend more on transportation; but with city-level
cadres essentially ignoring any emphasis their province-level superiors’ assign to the
environment. Reverse causation – province level cadres tailoring their utterances and internet
coverage to reflect city-level cadres’ decisions to invest in transportation infrastructure, rather
than environmental improvement – seems implausible.

14

Intriguingly, cities that have attracted foreign direct investment in the past spend more in
environmental amenities. Foreign investors might create pressure for environmental
improvements. We cannot cleanly distinguish this from cleaner air attracting more foreign direct
investment. Nonetheless, if top provincial cadres wish to implement policies conducive to FDI,
either direction suggests that they prepare for higher environmental spending.
These results are robust. Qualitatively similar findings emerge scaling the two sorts of
investment by their sum, instead of by GDP. Controlling for year fixed effects likewise yields
qualitatively similar results. So does dropping the global financial crisis years 2008 and 2009 to
eliminate observations potentially affected by China’s 2008 slowdown and aggressive 2009
macroeconomic stimuli.

4.

Cadres’ incentives regarding infrastructure

If city-level cadres are inclined towards spending available funds on transportation infrastructure
because this augments their odds of being promoted, this would be evident in their career
advancement paths. Having overseen rapid economic growth in one position is known to
statistically and economically significantly raise provincial-level cadre’s odds of promotion (Li
and Zhou, 2005; Chen, Li and Zhou, 2005). All sorts of city government spending can increase
aggregate demand and thus stimulate a city’s economic growth. However, spending on
transportation infrastructure immediately creates economic activity, and thus might have a more
immediate and tangible impact on economic growth than would spending on environmental
improvements. A better environment might attract migrants and investment, including foreign

15

investment, but its impact on recorded GDP growth is apt to be slower and spread out across the
more distant future.

4.1

Infrastructure Investment and GDP growth

Previous studies suggest that infrastructure investment induces an immediate boost to tangible
measures of local economic growth. Based on Chinese province-level economic growth results,
D´emurger (2001) argues that variation in provinces’ infrastructure capital stocks, especially in
those pertaining to transportation, is a key factor in explaining interprovincial variation in
economic growth rates. Lin and Song (2002) come to a similar conclusion about infrastructure
spending and economic growth using Chinese city-level data. Their cross-section results suggest
that cities that pave their gravel roads more rapidly exhibit faster contemporaneous tangible
economic growth. Fan and Zhang (2004) link infrastructure investment to tangible economic
growth in the rural area of China.
Because our city-level data do not include capital stock measures, the strategy of Lin and
Song (2002) is tractable while that of D´emurger (2001) is not. Again using data for 283 cities
from 2000 through 2009, Table 4 regresses annual real per capita GDP growth, calculated as first
differences in the log of real per capita GDP, on transportation infrastructure and environmental
investments, both again normalized by local GDP, and controls. The controls include one-year
lagged values of log real per capita GDP level as well as of FDI, total investment excluding
urban infrastructure investment, and government expenditure, all as fractions of local GDP.
Other factors may well enter – population growth rates, natural resource endowments, stocks of
human capital, and so on – but these are not available annually at the city-level. To mitigate
16

these deficiencies, we also include city fixed-effects, which Hausman tests again reveal to be
jointly significant. Standard error estimates are clustered by province.
Table 4 shows the coefficients of the various control variables to be generally consistent
with prior work: for example, local GDP growth is significantly positively related to investment.
Column (1) shows local GDP growth is also positive and statistically significantly related to
lagged transportation infrastructure investment as a fraction of local GDP. The point estimate
implies that a one standard deviation increase in transportation investment corresponds to an
additional 0.16 percentage point of local per capita GDP growth the next year (exp(0.799 ×
0.0020) ≈ 0.0016). This is in line with the effects found by D´emurger (2001) and Lin and Song
(2002). In contrast, environmental investment is statistically insignificant. In column (2) and (3)
additional lags of urban infrastructure investments are introduced, however neither measure is
significant.
These results are robust.

Qualitatively similar results ensue from introducing GDP

growth rate as the dependent variable in order to avoid potential errors in the imputed population
indicator 11. Introducing year fixed-effects as control variables and dropping the recession period
of 2008 and stimulus period of 2009 both likewise generate qualitatively similar results.
These findings are consistent with city governments spending on transportation
infrastructure boosting economic growth. However, a reversal causality scenario – expecting
rapid growth, city government invest more in transportation infrastructure – cannot be excluded.
Both directions of causality are consistent with the premise that city-level cadres more intent on

11

China collects population statistics every ten years in national censuses, the two most recent being in 2000 and
2010. Population levels in intervening years are imputed based from census data assuming constant annual
population growth rates. We therefore cannot include annual population growth rates in these regressions.

17

promoting tangible economic growth are also more inclined towards spending local government
funds on transportation infrastructure, rather than on environmental improvements.

4.2

Transportation infrastructure investments and land sales revenue

Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982) show that equilibrium real estate prices are fully determined by
the expected economic growth and quality-of-life (QOL) of a city. Because urban infrastructure
investment could enhance either a city’s QOL or its economic growth, or both, such investment
could raise real estate prices. Because revenue from land sales is an important off-budget
funding source for China’s local governments, higher land prices would loosen local government
cadres’ budget constraints. If investment in transportation infrastructure and investment in
environmental improvements affected land prices differently, local top cadres might have
different inclinations towards these sorts of investment.
Table 5 again uses panel of data for 283 cities from 2000 through 2009 to run regressions
explaining city-level annual rates of increase in land prices, measured as first differences in
logarithms of prices of land for all usages in constant 2009 yuan. The two key explanatory
variables are lagged values of the two types of urban infrastructure investment over local GDP,
and control variables include lagged values of the logarithm of the average real land price level,
the growth rate (first difference in logarithms) of real per capita GDP, and FDI, total investment
(excluding urban infrastructure investment), and government expenditure, with the last three
scaled by local GDP. Again, city fixed-effects are also included and are jointly significant in
Hausman tests. Standard error estimates are clustered by province.

18

Table 5 displays these regressions, which show lagged transportation infrastructure
investment significantly positively related to land prices. This effect is economically significant:
the coefficient implies that a one standard deviation increase in transportation infrastructure
investment over GDP corresponds to a land price growth rate higher by 4.5 percentage points the
following year (1.025 × 0.044 ≈ 0.0451). This amounts to a 21.5% increase in the average
annual land price growth rate for the 283 cities during the sample period.

In contrast,

environmental investment is unrelated to land prices.12
These results are robust. Qualitatively similar results ensue if we include cities’ land
supply each year, which is controlled by the city government, as another control variable. (We
do not include this control in the table because it is obviously endogenous.) Qualitatively similar
results also ensue from introducing the year fixed-effects and from dropping 2008 and 2009 data.
The results in Table 5 are consistent with transportation infrastructure investment
substantially raising land prices, and thus increasing city governments’ revenues from land sales.
Together with the results in Table 3, these findings are consistent with the existence of a positive
feedback cycle wherein local governments’ transportation infrastructure investment boosts land
sales income, which finances further transportation infrastructure investment by the city, and so
on ad infinitum. The bidirectional causality in such a feedback loop affects the reliability of the
point estimates in Table 5, but regardless of the direction of causality, city-level cadres would be
prone to invest in transportation infrastructure, as opposed to environmental improvements, if
tangible economic growth elevated their odds of being promoted. Spillover from such a positive
feedback loop might arise if higher land sales revenue can also help finance city governments’
12

Year-by-year cross sectional regressions without city fixed-effects (not shown) reveal a small and marginally
significant positive coefficient in 2009 only, perhaps not inconsistent with the very tentative advent of a shift
towards environmental factors mattering to land prices.

19

other investment projects, especially those that also boost local GDP growth. Environmental
improvements would not seem to qualify here either.

4.3

City-level Cadres’ Promotion Odds

Existing empirical work using provincial level data reveals overseeing rapid GDP growth to be
the most important determinant of a cadre being promoted (Li and Zhou, 2005; Chen, Li and
Zhou, 2005). If China’s merit-based management system encompasses city-level cadres, and if
their promotion odds are higher for having overseen rapid local GDP growth, their evident
preference for spending city government funds on transportation infrastructure, rather than
environmental improvements, follows.
To explore this connection, we estimate probit regressions explaining an indicator
variable set to one if a top city cadre, either its CCP Secretary or its mayor, is promoted within
the year. We say a cadre is promoted, and set the indicator variable to one, only if the next job is
a province-level or higher position; if a city-level mayor’s next job is as a city-level CCP
Secretary (either in the same or another city); if a cadre in other than a provincial capital is
moved to the same position in a provincial capital city; or if the cadre’s new position is similar to
the previous one but also entails selection as the member of the provincial CCP standing
committee (sheng wei chang wei). In all other cases, including retirements, we say the cadre is
not promoted and set the indicator to zero. Dropping these few observations instead yields
similar results to those in the tables.
“Abnormal” changes – death, arrest for corruption, etc. – are excluded from the sample.
We also drop observations corresponding to cadres’ first year in their positions. Also, because of
20

data limitations in calculating some of our control variables, we only include data for cadres who
assumed their current positions in or after the year 2000 in order to calculate some of our control
variables reliably. In a few cities, all the cadres during the sample period either were or were not
promoted; these observations are dropped because of the resulting collinearity with city fixedeffects, which are included throughout. We revisit these observations below as a robustness
check.
We have two sets of focal explanatory variables. The first contains three measures of the
GDP growth rate of a cadre’s city: its mean GDP growth rate from the first to last year of the
cadre’s tenure; the difference between this and the mean GDP growth rate of all other cities in
the same province during the same period; and the difference between the city’s mean GDP
growth rate during the cadre’s tenure and its mean GDP growth rate during the cadre’s
predecessor’s tenure.
The second set of focal explanatory variable gauge infrastructure spending.

These

include the two types of urban infrastructure investment; each scaled by GDP and averaged over
the cadre’s tenure from first to last year. Promotions may result from factors other than high
GDP growth.

For example, increased transportation infrastructure or better environmental

outcomes might add to a cadre’s odds of promotion, over and above their effect through
economic growth.
Control variables include the following. Various personal attributes of cadres might also
affect their odds of promotion. Therefore, we control for them. Detailed definitions of these
variables are provided in the appendix. City fixed-effects are also included, and standard error
estimates are clustered by cadre because any given cadre may appear in the panel multiple times

21

– once for each year in each position.

Because the determinants of promotion for Party

Secretaries and mayors may differ, we run probit regressions separately for each class of citylevel top cadre.
Table 6 and 7 display these regressions for Party Secretaries and mayors, respectively. In
both tables, the difference between the city’s GDP growth rate during the cadre’s tenure less that
during his predecessor’s tenure is the only GDP growth measure to be significantly positive.
This is consistent with cadres’ promotions depending on outdoing their predecessors in
encouraging rapid economic growth. Province-level cadres judging city-level cadres’
performance primarily against this benchmark is plausible.

Because China’s cities exhibit

substantial economic heterogeneity, a given city’s growth under a prior civic administration is
arguably a better bar than the growth rates of other cities. The finding that mayors’ promotions
are more significantly correlated with GDP growth than are Party Secretaries promotions is
consistent with previous findings regarding provincial-level cadres’ promotions (Li and Zhou,
2005).
The regression coefficients permit assessment of the economic significance of these
factors in explaining a cadre’s odds of promotion. One standard deviation increase in average
GDP growth rate compared with the predecessor raises the probability of promotion by 4.76
percentage points for secretaries and 10.0 percentage points for mayors. This is consistent with
the fact that typically the tasks for CCP secretaries are more diversified than just the high GDP
growth rate.
Remarkably, a city’s investment in transportation infrastructure is completely
insignificant in explaining its senior cadres’ odds of promotion.

22

This finding is perhaps

consistent with spending on transportation infrastructure being motivated by its contribution to
GDP growth.
Most remarkably of all, a city government’s spending on environmental improvements is
actually significantly negatively related to the odds of its CCP secretary and mayor being
promoted. One standard deviation increase in average GDP scaled environmental improvement
investment lowers the probability of promotion by 8.5 percentage points for secretaries and 6.3
percentage points for mayors. This finding suggests that other factors are at work. Perhaps citylevel “environmentalists” offend province-level cadres whose promotions previous work shows
to be more clearly driven by economic growth. Or perhaps city-level cadres with less hope for
promotion or less career-minded are more apt to invest in environmental improvements. This
interpretation is consistent with the narrative story that “promotion based on tangible growth
performance” induces government leaders competing for promotion invest in transportation
infrastructure, rather than in environmental amenities, because the former contributes more
readily to tangible growth.
Nevertheless, it is still necessary for local officers to maintain a minimum level of
investment on environmental amenities to secure his/her political career, instead of just cutting
down all the environmental investments. In China “keeping social stability” is always a key
criterion with decisive and veto power (yi piao fou jue) for local officers; in other words, all
other achievements are equal to nothing if collective petitions or massive protests occur in
his/her jurisdiction (Chen, 2012). Therefore, with the emerging environment-related petitions
and protests in China (Xie, 2009), failing to maintain a basic standard of environmental
amenities would be very risky for local officers. Most recently, the central government also
explicitly listed environmental protection as an evaluation indicator for local officers in its latest
23

“12th Five-year Plan (2010-2015) for Environment Protection” released in 2011, which may
provide more direct incentives for local officers to expand environmental investments.
The relationships of cadres’ personal attributes to their promotion odds are less surprising.
A cadre’s age upon assuming the current position is most significant, especially for the CCP
Secretaries. Cadres who assumed their current position at an age too near the typical retirement
age are potentially less likely to be further promoted. The effect of gender is opposite in the two
groups of cadres: female CCP secretaries are more likely to be promoted; female mayors are less
likely. Cadres’ educational background is insignificantly related to their promotion odds. Their
previous work experience reveals past positions in other provinces to be helpful for the mayors,
but not for Party Secretaries and past positions in SOEs to weigh against promotion, especially
for Party Secretaries.
These results are again robust. Including year fixed-effects to control for promotion
decisions being clustered in certain years yields qualitatively similar results to those in the tables.
We also tried including observations where all cadres in a given city were either promoted or not
promoted, and this also yields qualitatively similar results to those shown. Rerunning the probits
using indicators set to one if a cadre is promoted within two, three, or four years, rather than
within one year, also all generate qualitatively similar results. Longer windows mean each cadre
enters the panel only once.13 Running Cox proportional hazard regressions, rather than probits,
also generates qualitatively similar results: environmental investment significantly negatively
affects the promotion odds of both CCP Secretaries and mayors, while transportation
infrastructure investment is insignificant. GDP growth compared with that under the cadre’s

13

In our data, Party Secretaries spend an average of 3.36 years and mayors an average of 2.91 years before being
promoted or otherwise reassigned.

24

predecessor is also positive and statistically significant for mayors, but less significant for CCP
Secretaries.

Conclusions

China, while generating miraculously fast economic growth, is also well known for severe air
pollution and a range of other environmental problems. Likewise, its problems in providing of
key public goods, including basic healthcare, universal public education, and social security,
continue to draw both national and international criticism. The China’s 12th five year plan sets
‘green’ achievements and the enhanced provision of public services as important targets. The
World Bank’s “China 2030” report also flags these issues as critical to making China’s growth
sustainable.
These outcomes appear to be due to the promotion incentives, assigned responsibilities,
and budget constraints with which China’s public governance surrounds city-level Party cadres.
Local governments are assigned the lion’s share of responsibility for providing urban
infrastructure and basic public services. However, local governments’ revenues based on tax
revenue sharing and intergovernmental fiscal transfers are insufficient to cover these expenses.
Party cadres assigned to local governments must resolve this arithmetic impossibility, knowing
that their careers are governed by promotion criteria, applied every three or so years, emphasizes
the delivery of tangible economic growth. Given these duties, these budget constraints, and this
system of career advancement incentives, local government cadres quite rationally invest scare
public funds in investments that produce tangible evidence of growth within a few years.

25

The results above, exploring spending on urban infrastructure, illustrate this logic. From
2000 through 2009, city-level governments spending on urban infrastructure stressed
transportation over environmental amenities.

Senior cadres’ public statements calling for

transportation infrastructure heralded transportation infrastructure spending; but, like calls for
spending on improving the environment did not similarly stimulate spending on environment –
even as environmental conditions in major Chinese cities worsened palpably, senior central
government cadres’ speeches increasingly drew attention to environmental issues, and data
accumulated shows that spending on environmental amenities significantly improves air quality.
The empirical results above reveal that spending on transportation infrastructure raises
both GDP growth, a key promotion determinant, and land prices. Because land lease sales are
city-level governments’ sole major source of additional revenues, policies that elevate land
prices held city-level cadres cope with the mismatch of their heavy spending responsibilities and
inadequate fiscal transfers from Beijing. This gives city-level cadres an added incentive to favor
transportation infrastructure spending – it loosens their budget constraints.

Investing in

environmental improvements has no such salubrious consequences.
Indeed, our empirical results indicate that spending on environmental amenities
negatively affects city-level cadres’ odds of promotion. This is plausibly because funds spent on
the environment do not translate as surely into added local GDP growth; though we cannot reject
the possibility that cadres less keen on rapid promotion might also favor environmental
improvements. Regardless, either interpretation reinforces the point that cadres’ promotion
concerns very likely affect local governments’ spending priorities.

26

Our empirical findings could also be partially driven by other latent issues that we have
yet to explore. For example, cities with rapid GDP growth might have more resources and
opportunities for cronyism, and top cadres in these cities might be promoted faster. Or, investing
in transportation infrastructure and allowing rapid rises in land prices and real estate might be an
effective way to channel benefits to connected parties.
Obviously, because we cannot observe China’s collective social welfare function, we
cannot conclude that our findings indicate inefficient resource allocation. It remains plausible
that the governments’ action matches people’s preference: people might want to get rich first,
and only afterwards grow concerned improving the environment, or public education or health
care.
Regardless, our findings reveal the importance of government officials’ incentives,
assigned responsibilities, and budget constraint. Clearly, even the behavior of career members of
the Chinese Communist Party is shaped by the incentives set before them: cadres appear to
enthusiastically fulfill the parts of their assigned responsibilities that are rewarded and to ignore
those that are not incorporated in the incentive system. Moreover, all this occurs is shaped by a
budgetary process: Chinese Communist Party cadres enthusiastically fulfill assigned
responsibilities that expand their budgets, while ignoring assigned responsibilities that do not.
Communist Party cadres, in short, appear to be card-carrying members of the species hommo
economicus.
China’s new five year plan emphasizes protecting the environment, raising health care
standards, and enhancing the quality and universality of public education. These policy goals
plausibly have localized idiosyncrasies that justify their delegation to local cadres.

27

To

implement these policy goals, senior Party cadres may wish to consider carefully the ways in
which lower-level cadres’ career incentives, policy responsibilities, and budget constraints are
likely to interact. Specifically, the analysis above suggests that, should China’s senior leadership
wish to improve air quality, or achieve any other such environmental goal, steps might be taken
to include measurable and tangible evidence of progress towards this in formulae determining
lower level cadres’ promotions and budgets.

Appendix: Data Description

(1) City-Level Statistics
By the end of 2009 there are 287 cities which are classified at or above municipal level (di ji shi)
in mainland China. Our empirical analyses cover 283 of them, excluding the four “provincelevel” municipalities (namely, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing). All the city statistics
variables in our sample are available by annual series between 2000 and 2009, and by crosssection over 283 cities, except for the air quality, which is available in 82 cities only.
The variables’ definitions, sources and major statistics are listed in Table A-1. All the
monetary variables are normalized by local GDP volume in the same year unless otherwise
stated.
(2) Information on City Officers
During the sample period between 2000 and 2009, there are totally 976 CCP secretaries and
1075 mayors in the 283 cities. (According to our definition in this paper, if a turnover happens
on or before June 30th, the corresponding city-year will be allocated to the newly-appointed
officer, otherwise it will come to the predecessor.)
When a secretary or mayor is appointed, his/her official resume will be publicly reported
in local medias, from which we collect the information on the officers’ personal characteristics,
previous working experience, and whether he/she gets promoted or not after current position.
The variables’ definitions, sources and major statistics are listed in Table A-2.
