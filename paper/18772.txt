ABSTRACT
We examine long-term neighborhood effects on low-income families using data from the Moving
to Opportunity (MTO) randomized housing-mobility experiment, which offered some public-housing
families but not others the chance to move to less-disadvantaged neighborhoods. We show that 10-15
years after baseline MTO improves adult physical and mental health; has no detectable effect on economic
outcomes, youth schooling and youth physical health; and mixed results by gender on other youth
outcomes, with girls doing better on some measures and boys doing worse. Despite the somewhat
mixed pattern of impacts on traditional behavioral outcomes, MTO moves substantially improve adult
subjective well-being.

Research dating back to at least the 17th century has shown that people living in more
disadvantaged neighborhoods fare worse with respect to earnings, education, health, crime
involvement and other life outcomes (Jencks and Mayer 1990; Ellen and Turner 1997; Sampson,
Raudenbush, and Earls 1997; Kawachi and Berkman 2003; Sampson, Morenoff, and GannonRowley 2002; Sampson 2012). These patterns have led to concern that neighborhood
environments may exert independent causal effects on people’s long-term life chances. Living in
a disadvantaged social environment may depress life outcomes by, for example, shaping
exposure to peer norms or access to resources such as schools or job referrals. However some
theories yield the opposite prediction about the effects of moving into a more affluent area, since
more affluent areas could have greater discrimination and competition from advantaged peers
and fewer social services for the poor.
Isolating the causal effects of neighborhood environments on behavior and well-being is
complicated by the fact that most people have at least some degree of choice over where they
live. Observational studies may confound neighborhood influences with those of hard-tomeasure individual- or family-level attributes that affect both residential sorting and the
behavioral outcomes of interest.
Evidence on “neighborhood effects” is of growing relevance because neighborhood
residential segregation by income has been increasing in the United States since 1970 even
beyond the amount expected from rising income inequality alone (Reardon and Bischoff 2011).
Nearly 9 million Americans live in “extreme-poverty” neighborhoods in which at least 40
percent of residents are poor (Kneebone, Nadeau, and Berube 2011). Knowledge of
neighborhood effects (and the mechanisms behind such effects) is essential for evaluating

1

policies that affect how people are sorted across neighborhoods and for assessing the efficiency
of private housing market outcomes.
This paper examines the long-term effects on low-income parents and children of moving
from very disadvantaged to less distressed neighborhoods, using data from a unique, large-scale
randomized social experiment – the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD’s) Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration. Via random lottery, MTO offered
housing vouchers to families with children living in high-poverty public housing projects that
facilitate moves to less-distressed areas. MTO randomization generates large, persistent
differences in neighborhood conditions for otherwise comparable groups and enables us to
attribute group differences in post-baseline outcomes to the offer to move through MTO.
We find that 10-15 years after randomization, MTO-assisted moves improve several key
adult mental and physical health outcomes, but have no consistent detectable impacts on adult
economic self-sufficiency or children’s educational achievement outcomes, even for children
who were too young to have enrolled in school at baseline. We also find signs of the same
gender difference in the effects of MTO moves on youth risky behaviors and health found in the
interim (4-7 year) follow-up, with girls doing better in some ways while boys do worse (Kling,
Liebman, and Katz 2007). Despite the mixed MTO impacts on the standard outcomes that have
dominated the neighborhood-effects literature, MTO moves generate a large gain in subjective
well-being (SWB) for adults (Ludwig et al. 2012).

I.

The Moving to Opportunity Experiment1
From 1994 to 1998 MTO enrolled 4,604 low-income public housing families living in

high-poverty neighborhoods within five U.S. cities: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles,
and New York. Families were randomized into three groups: i) the Experimental group, which
received housing vouchers that subsidize private-market rents and could only be used in census
tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent, and additional housing-mobility counseling; ii)
the Section 8 group, which received regular housing vouchers without any MTO relocation
constraint; and iii) a control group, which received no assistance through MTO. Some 48% of
households assigned to the Experimental group and 63% of those assigned to the Section 8 group
moved through MTO (the MTO “compliance rate”).
Data from baseline surveys show that these families were quite economically
disadvantaged when they applied for MTO (see Appendix Table 1). Most household heads were
African-American or Hispanic females; fewer than 40% had completed high school. Around
three-quarters of applicants reported getting away from gangs and drugs as the most important
reason for enrolling in MTO. As one would expect from a properly-conducted random
assignment, the distribution of baseline characteristics is balanced between the treatment and
control groups.

II.

Measures and Methods
To measure long-term outcomes, our research team subcontracted with the Institute for

Social Research at the University of Michigan to collect in-person data with 3,273 MTO adults
and 5,105 youth who were ages 10-20 at the end of 2007. Data were collected between 2008 and
1

Additional details about the Moving to Opportunity experiment and long-term follow-up data collection are
reported in Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011).

2010, or 10-15 years after baseline. The effective response rates equaled 90% for MTO adults
and 89% for youth, and were generally similar across randomized MTO groups. Adults in the
Section 8 group were interviewed slightly later than other adults because funding for this activity
was secured later during the project; we discuss implications of this delay below.
To measure neighborhood conditions we collected self-report address information and
passive tracking data, which we linked to census tract-level data from the 1990 and 2000
censuses and the 2005-09 American Community Surveys. We focus on duration-weighted
average tract characteristics over the 10-15 year study period, since people’s life outcomes may
depend on cumulative exposure to neighborhood environments. Our surveys also asked MTO
adults and youth to self-report about their neighborhood conditions.
Our primary focus is on indices of adult outcomes in the domains of economic outcomes,
physical health, and mental health, and youth outcomes in the domains of education, physical
health, mental health, and risky behavior. The outcome indices are constructed from a set of
individual outcomes from our surveys that are rescaled so that higher values represent “better”
outcomes and then converted to Z-scores using the control group distribution. Aggregating
outcomes improves statistical power to detect impacts and reduces the risk of “false positives” by
reducing the number of statistical tests carried out. To further reduce the risk of false positives
due to data mining, the outcome indices we examine were pre-specified for the interim MTO
follow-up done in 2002 (Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007).
We present intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates that capture the effect of being offered the
chance to use an MTO voucher to move into a different neighborhood. These estimates are
calculated as the difference in average outcomes for families assigned to treatment versus the
control condition, by regressing an outcome index against indicators for treatment-group

4

assignment and (pre-random assignment) baseline covariates that include indicators for MTO
demonstration site and participant socio-demographic characteristics to improve precision (see
Appendix Table 1). The estimates are weighted to account for changes over time in the
probability of treatment assignment due to higher-than-expected compliance rates.
We also present estimates of the effects of treatment on the treated (TOT), which use
random assignment indicators as instruments for moving through MTO in the Experimental or
Section 8 groups and assume the treatment assignment only affects families who move using a
MTO voucher (Bloom 1984; Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996). The TOT estimates are about
twice as large as the estimated ITT effects for the Experimental group and about 1.6 times as
large as the ITT effect for the Section 8 group.

III.

Results
One year after baseline, the average control group adult was living in a neighborhood

with an average tract poverty rate of 50 percent (Appendix Table 2). Moving with an
Experimental voucher reduced average tract poverty rates one year after baseline by 35
percentage points (2.85 standard deviations in the 2000 census tract poverty distribution), while
moving through MTO with a regular Section 8 voucher reduced tract poverty rates by 21
percentage points (1.73 standard deviations). These differences across MTO groups in
neighborhood conditions narrowed over time, mostly because the average neighborhood poverty
rates for the control group declined.
Despite the partial convergence of neighborhood conditions across MTO groups over the
study period, MTO-induced differences in duration-weighted average tract poverty rates over the
course of the 10-15 year follow-up period were quite sizable. Figure 1 shows that a large share of

5

adults who moved with an Experimental-group voucher (the Experimental Group Compliers)
had an average tract poverty rate below 20%, which was true for few control group families. The
effects of moving with a regular Section 8 voucher on average tract poverty rates were somewhat
less pronounced. (Appendix Table 2 presents MTO impacts on a broader set of neighborhood
characteristics.)
Contrary to the widespread view that living in a disadvantaged inner-city neighborhood
depresses labor market outcomes, Table 1 shows that being offered a voucher through MTO did
not improve economic self-sufficiency, at least for this study sample. Although the ITT estimate
for the Section 8 group was negative and marginally significant (p<.10), we believe this was
most likely an artifact of our interviewing the Section 8 group adults a bit later than control
adults, when labor market conditions were less favorable (see Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011).
The results in Table 1 also hint at some potentially positive impacts of MTO on adult
mental and physical health outcomes, with ITT effects on these broad health outcome indices
that were in the direction of better health but not quite statistically significant. However some
specific individual health outcomes showed large and statistically significant improvements in
response to MTO-assisted moves. For example, moving with an Experimental-group voucher
(the TOT effect) reduced the prevalence of having a body mass index of 40 or more (BMI,
defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) by 7 percentage points.
This was a decline of nearly 40% of the control group mean of 18 percent (Ludwig et al. 2011).
For a five-foot-four woman, a BMI of 40 would correspond to a weight of about 235 pounds. We
also found the Experimental-voucher TOT effect reduced the prevalence of diabetes, measured
from blood samples and defined as having a level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5%,
by 10 percentage points, or one-half of the control group’s rate.

6

We found no evidence that MTO had beneficial impacts on youth educational outcomes.
Effects on math and reading test scores were very close to zero both for youth who were preschool age at baseline and for youth who were ages 6 and up at baseline. MTO did tend to have
some beneficial effects on female but not male youth in other outcome domains (Table 2).
Assignment to the Experimental and Section 8 groups improved physical health for girls, while
the Experimental-group effect on mental health outcomes is also positive and statistically
significant for girls. The estimated effects on health outcomes for boys ranged from zero to
negative (worse health). We can reject the null hypothesis that the physical and mental health
impacts of the Experimental treatment were the same by gender (Appendix Table 3).

IV.

Extensions
The MTO findings about the effects of changes in neighborhood environments on key

outcomes like economic self-sufficiency and children’s schooling outcomes run counter to much
of what previous theories and observational research have suggested. One common explanation
for this discrepancy is that MTO generates too small of a “treatment dose” on neighborhood
environments to provide a meaningful test of “neighborhood effects” theories. This section
discusses that issue and also provides some additional results showing MTO’s effects on various
behavioral outcomes.

7

A. Impacts on neighborhood environments
In this section we provide more details on the nature and magnitude of MTO’s effects on
the neighborhood conditions in which families were living during our study period.
A1. MTO effects on neighborhood poverty
Appendix Table 2 shows that one year after random assignment, the average control
group family was living in a neighborhood that had a poverty rate of 50 percent or 2.92 standard
deviations (SD) above the national average in the 2000 census nationwide tract-poverty
distribution. The ITT effect on neighborhood poverty was 17 percentage points for the
Experimental group and 13 percentage points for the Section 8 group at one year after random
assignment. Actually moving with an Experimental-group voucher reduced average tract poverty
rates by 35 percentage points, or 2.85 SD – moving families almost down to the national average
poverty rate. The effect of moving with a regular Section 8 voucher that did not have the
mobility restriction was smaller but still sizable – equal to 21 percentage points or 1.73 SD in the
national distribution.
Over time the MTO effect on neighborhood conditions declined, due partly to secondary
moves by MTO families after their initial MTO-assisted voucher moves but mostly to declines
over time in the average tract poverty rate of families in the control group. For example, the
Experimental-voucher TOT effect on tract poverty rates was 35 percentage points measured 1
year after baseline and about 8 percentage points measured 10-15 years after baseline, a decline
of 27 percentage points. Much of this attenuation of the MTO effect on neighborhood poverty
rates came from the fact that the average tract poverty rate for control families declined from 50
percent one year after baseline down to 31 percent 10-15 years after baseline, a drop of 19
percentage points. Most of the decline in neighborhood poverty rates among families in the

8

control group was due to mobility rather than to gentrification of the neighborhoods in which
control families were living. This conclusion came from results (not shown) that re-estimated
MTO impacts on neighborhood conditions at different points in time since randomization but
holding the poverty rates of all tracts constant at their levels in the 2000 census.
Whatever the cause, it is clear that the neighborhood conditions of the MTO treatment
and control groups partially converged over time. Because behavioral change may require
accumulated exposure to neighborhood environments, however, we also examined the average
neighborhood conditions that families experienced over the entire post-randomization period.
Appendix Table 2 shows that over the course of the study period the average control group
family lived in a census tract with a poverty rate of 40 percent. Moving with an Experimental
voucher reduces average tract poverty rates for families by 18 percentage points. This decline is
quite large, amounting to nearly one-half the control mean and 1.48 standard deviations in the
2000 national tract poverty distribution, and much larger than poverty reductions that might be
accomplished with almost any place-based neighborhood policy.
Another way to consider the size of the MTO “treatment dose” on neighborhood
conditions is to ask how much larger such a dose could possibly be from a large-scale mobility
program. The answer is not much. A common measure of residential segregation is the
“dissimilarity index,” defined as the share of people who would need to be moved across census
tracts within a given area in order to have the share of poor people in each tract equal the share of
the larger area that is poor. The five MTO demonstration cities have poverty rates right now
around 20 percent.2 The average tract poverty rate of MTO Experimental group movers (about
21 percent) roughly corresponds to the dissimilarity-index benchmark of perfect poverty
2

Data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for 2006 through 2010 show the poverty rates for
the five MTO cities are: Baltimore (21.3 percent); Boston (21.2); Chicago (20.9); Los Angeles (19.5); and New
York (19.1). See www.census.gov.

9

integration in these MTO cities. The national poverty rate in the U.S. as a whole right now is 15
percent, so even if a residential mobility program were to move inner-city families at random
across neighborhoods all over the country, there is scope for achieving more economic
integration than was achieved in the MTO Experimental group when the overall poverty rate is
15 or 20 percent.
A2. MTO effects on other neighborhood conditions
Although MTO focused explicitly on reducing economic rather than racial segregation
for participating families, one might have expected important changes in neighborhood racial
segregation as a byproduct of the MTO moves, given that residents of high-poverty
neighborhoods are very disproportionately likely to be Hispanic or African-American
(Jargowsky 1997; Jargowsky 2003). Appendix Table 2 makes clear, however, that MTO’s
impacts on racial segregation for participants were fairly modest and much smaller than impacts
on economic segregation. The average control group family spent the study period living in a
census tract that was 88 percent minority. The tract share minority for those who moved with an
Experimental voucher was lower by a statistically significant amount, but the TOT effect of
about 12 percentage points means that, over the study period, even the Experimental-group
movers were living in census tracts in which fully three-quarters of all residents were members
of racial and ethnic minority groups.
Despite the lack of MTO impact on neighborhood racial composition, MTO moves led to
sizable changes in neighborhood social processes that a growing body of sociological research
suggests might be particularly important in affecting people’s life outcomes (see for example
Sampson, Morenoff, and Gannon-Rowley 2002; Sampson 2012). For example Appendix Table 2
shows that in survey self-reports 10 to 15 years after baseline – after the partial convergence in

10

neighborhood poverty rates between treatment and control groups had occurred – the
Experimental-voucher TOT effect on the chance of having at least one college-educated friend
was nearly 15 percentage points, or about a third of the control mean of 53 percent. The
Experimental-voucher TOT effect on the likelihood that neighbors would do something if local
youth were spraying graffiti (intended to measure what Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls (1997),
call “collective efficacy” – the willingness of neighbors to work together to enforce shared social
norms) was over 16 percentage points, more than a quarter of the control mean of 59 percent.
MTO also changed safety – the neighborhood condition that was the main reason most
MTO families originally signed up for the program. Moving with an Experimental voucher
reduced the local violent-crime rate (as measured by police data) by 833 violent crimes per
100,000 residents, over one-third of the control mean of 2,317.3 Self-reported data about
neighborhood safety showed similarly large effects. The Experimental-voucher TOT effect on
the likelihood that adults reported feeling unsafe in their neighborhood during the day equaled 8
percentage points, over one-third of the control group’s rate of 20 percent. The likelihood of
having seen drugs used or sold in the neighborhood over the past month was 13 percentage
points lower in the Experimental group than the control group value of 31 percent.
Because moving itself is part of the MTO treatment and could have independent effects
on people’s life outcomes, it is important to keep in mind that the control group averaged about
2.2 moves over the course of the 10-15 year follow-up study period. Treatment assignment
increased the average number of moves over 10 to 15 years by about half a move.

3

The results reported here for local-area crime rates are slightly different from those reported in Ludwig (2012) due
to corrections and updates to the available administrative crime records used for analysis.

11

B. Additional Impacts on Behavioral Outcomes
The results presented in Table 1 above provide a broad summary of the effects of MTOassisted moves on the behavioral outcomes of adults, while the results in Table 2 summarize the
effects on youth. In this section we provide more details about impacts on the individual
outcomes that underlie these broad outcome indices.
B1. MTO impacts on adult outcomes
Given the widely held view that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood depresses
earnings and employment, due to peer norms or lack of access to informal job referrals or some
other reason, one of the most surprising findings shown in Table 1 is that moving to a lessdistressed area with a regular Section 8 voucher seems to have reduced economic selfsufficiency. As noted above, we believe that this is most likely a spurious result – a consequence
of having secured funding to survey the Section 8 adults later in the research project and
therefore interviewing them later in calendar time, when labor market conditions were weaker as
a result of the economic recession, than when we interviewed the control group.
The top of Appendix Table 4 shows that MTO impacts on survey reports of adult
economic outcomes are not statistically significant for the Experimental group, but for the
Section 8 group tend to be in the direction of worse economic outcomes. However the bottom
panel of Appendix Table 4 shows MTO impacts on adult employment rates and earnings as
measured by quarterly administrative records obtained from state unemployment insurance (UI)
systems, which we can use to measure outcomes at a common point in time across groups. We
found no signs of a negative effect on economic outcomes in the Section 8 group with
administrative data. We can also see this in Appendix Figure 2, which shows quarter-by-quarter
employment rates for all three randomized MTO groups. Experimental group employment rates

12

increased dramatically in the early years of the program, which coincided with welfare reform
and very low unemployment, but the control group employment rates tracked these employment
rate changes very closely during these as well as later years of the study period.
Although Table 1 shows that the overall MTO impacts on our broad physical and mental
health outcome indices were not quite statistically significant, MTO did significantly improve
several important individual indicators of health as described in Appendix Table 5. For example,
the top panel shows that moving with an MTO Experimental group voucher reduced an indicator
of short-term psychological distress (the K6 index) by one-fifth of a standard deviation, with
impacts of moving with a regular Section 8 voucher roughly half as large.
MTO had no detectable effects on overall self-reported health status, but we found
sizable impacts on a variety of specific health conditions. Moving with an Experimental voucher
reduced the chances that MTO adults had difficulty lifting groceries by about 10 percentage
points or one-fifth the control mean. Appendix Table 5 also shows MTO impacts on diabetes and
measures of obesity and extreme obesity– based on different cut-points in the BMI distribution –
taken from Ludwig et al. (2011). Although the interim MTO study found that MTO reduced
obesity prevalence, defined as BMI 30, we found no impact on this outcome in the long-term
data – perhaps because nearly three in five MTO adults are obese in those data. We did find
sizable impacts at higher BMI cut points. Moving with either an Experimental or regular Section
8 voucher reduced the likelihood of having BMI 35 by about 9 or 10 percentage points, over a
quarter of the control mean of 35 percent. The Experimental-voucher TOT effect on extreme
obesity (BMI 40) was 7 percentage points, 40 percent of the control mean of 18 percent. We
used blood samples to measure diabetes, since nearly a third of all diabetes cases are
undiagnosed (Cowie et al. 2006) and the likelihood of diagnosis could vary across areas. The

13

Experimental-voucher TOT effect on diabetes was a reduction of 10 percentage points, about
half the control-group mean of 20 percent.
Because economic outcomes and particularly health outcomes are expected to vary by
age, it is possible that MTO’s effects on adult outcomes could also have varied by age. Appendix
Table 6 presents results for economic outcomes and individual health outcomes separately for
adults who were under 33 years of age versus 33 years and older at the time of random
assignment. We found little consistent evidence that there were detectable differences in longrun MTO impacts on adults by age.
Although MTO has overall a mixed pattern of impacts on the sort of traditional measure
of objective outcomes that dominate the neighborhood-effects literature, Appendix Table 7
(reproduced from the supplemental appendix to Ludwig et al. (2012)) shows that MTO moves
nonetheless generated very sizable gains in adult self-reports of subjective well-being (SWB).
The long-term MTO data included the standard SWB measure that has been used as part of the
General Social Survey (“Taken all together, how would you say things are these days – would
you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?”) The proper interpretation of
SWB measures remains the topic of some debate. Previous studies have shown different
measures of self-reported SWB to be correlated in expected ways with objective indicators of
well-being such as life events, biological indicators, and reports by other people about the
person’s happiness (see for example Kahneman and Krueger (2006) and Oswald and Wu
(2010)). The TOT effects on SWB equaled 0.16SD for the Experimental group and 0.19SD for
the Section 8 group.
Appendix Figure 3 (taken from Ludwig et al. (2012)) suggests that adult SWB was more
strongly affected by neighborhood economic segregation than by racial segregation. The analysis

14

estimates the relationship between SWB and duration-weighted neighborhood characteristics
measures by using interactions of MTO treatment assignment and city indicators as instrumental
variables to deal with the endogeneity of neighborhood location. Panel A shows that there was a
negative relationship between SWB and average tract poverty rates when that is the only
neighborhood measure included as an explanatory variable in the model. Panel B shows the same
was true for the relationship between SWB and tract minority share. When tract poverty and tract
minority share are included in the model at the same time, SWB had an even more pronounced
negative relationship with tract poverty (Panel C) but SWB had a positive relationship with tract
minority share (Panel D). A qualitatively similar pattern held for our broad indices for outcomes
in the physical and mental health domains as well (see Appendix Tables 8 and 9 for details).
This pattern is important because while racial segregation has been declining in the U.S.
since 1970, to levels not seen since 1970 (Glaeser and Vigdor 2012), income segregation has
been increasing since 1970 (Watson 2009; Reardon and Bischoff 2011). Our results suggest the
adverse effect of disadvantaged neighborhood environments on the well-being of poor families
has been getting worse over time, and that trends over time in growing inequality in family
income may understate the growth over time in the inequality of overall well-being.
B2. MTO impacts on youth outcomes
Appendix Table 10 shows that the long-term data are qualitatively consistent with the
interim MTO study in showing a gender difference in MTO impacts on youth – with female
youth having had positive impacts on some outcomes, while males had negative impacts –
although the youth impacts were generally more muted in the long-term than interim data.4 For
4

These youth estimates for MTO ITT and TOT effects come from a set of regressions that have a similar
specification to those for the MTO adult sample, but now cluster standard errors at the baseline-household level to
account for the non-independence of observations for children drawn from the same family, and control for a
slightly different set of baseline covariates (see Appendix Table 1B).

15

female youth MTO moves with either an Experimental or regular Section 8 voucher reduced the
share overweight (which for youth is defined as BMI 95th percentile), with an ITT effect equal
to about five percentage points or a fifth of the control mean.5 The Experimental-voucher moves
also improved mental health, as indicated by declines in the K6 measure of short-term
psychological distress. For male youth most of the impacts were either not statistically
significant or tended to indicate worse outcomes as a result of MTO moves, for example with
respect to injury prevalence, smoking, or likelihood of being educationally on track. We found
no signs of the large declines in youth violence rates found among both male and female youth in
the interim MTO data (Kling, Ludwig, and Katz 2005).
We note that the set of youth we surveyed for the long-term MTO study, ages 10-20 at
the end of 2007, overlaps very little with youth analyzed in the interim MTO study, who were
10-20 at the end of 2001. Our long-term results thus help confirm the previous (surprising)
results for the gender difference in MTO impacts among a different group of MTO children.
We found few statistically significant MTO impacts on educational outcomes in the longterm data, either with respect to measures of school persistence or achievement test scores (Panel
C of Appendix Table 10).6 The standard errors around our estimates indicate that impacts on
achievement test scores larger than about 0.10 or 0.15 SD were very unlikely.

Our main results define childhood obesity using the Centers for Disease Control definition – body mass index
above the 95th percentile for a given age-sex group as estimated from a set of national health studies collected in the
1960s through 1990s (www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad314.pdf). This result (and hence the results for the overall
physical health index for female youth) is somewhat sensitive to using alternative definitions of childhood obesity;
for example the result is not quite statistically significant when we instead use the definition developed by the
International Obesity Task Force, which uses a different set of age-sex BMI cut points derived from international
data; for additional details see Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011).

Our in-person interviews with MTO youth included a 45-minute achievement assessment in math and reading as
designed for the 5th and 8th grade follow-up waves of the U.S. Department of Education’s Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). Youth ages 10-12 were administered the 5th grade test, while
youth ages 13-20 at the end of 2007 were administered the 8th grade test. To guard against the possibility that some
13-20 year olds would find the items on the 8th grade test too easy and answer every item correctly, in which case
the assessment would lose its ability to provide information about which youth in the study know more than others
(a “ceiling effect”), we supplemented the ECLS-K 8th grade test with a small set of math and reading items from the

16

One of the main motivations for following up with youth in the long-term study was the
possibility that youth who were very young at baseline may have experienced particularly
pronounced gains from MTO moves. After all, children who were pre-school age at baseline did
not yet really have social networks or a sense of social identity before they moved. Moreover
they experienced massive changes in neighborhood poverty (up to 3SD in the national
distribution one year after randomization) during the life stage when children are thought to be
most developmentally malleable. Yet Appendix Table 11 shows that even for children who were
under age 6 at baseline we found no signs of any detectable changes in achievement test scores.
The MTO effects that we do observe among youth – health impacts on female youth –
seem to be driven more by neighborhood economic disadvantage than neighborhood minority
composition. Appendix Tables 12 and 13 present the results of using interactions of indicators
for MTO treatment-group assignment and baseline demonstration site as instruments for
duration-weighted tract poverty or tract minority share, and show little evidence of a ‘doseresponse’ relationship between either measure and any outcomes when we look at all youth
together. The same is true when we look at male youth (Appendix Tables 16 and 17). However
Appendix Table 14 shows that the MTO effect on physical health of female youth is more
strongly related to tract poverty than tract minority share when each is included one at a time as
the endogenous explanatory variable in our instrumental variables model. When both are
included in the same IV model simultaneously, we can reject the null hypothesis that the
coefficients on tract poverty and tract minority share are the same (Appendix Table 15). The data
provide some suggestive indication that mental health for female youth might also be more
strongly related to tract poverty than tract minority share; when both are included in the same IV
U.S. Department of Education’s National Educational Longitudinal Survey-1988 (NELS). The results presented in
our table here report just on youth who were 13-20 at the end of 2007 who took the 8th grade test; results are similar
for the 10-12 year olds.

17

model at the same time the coefficient is much larger in absolute value for tract poverty,
although given the standard errors around our estimates we cannot reject the null hypothesis that
the coefficients on tract poverty and minority share are the same.

V.

Discussion
The MTO long-term results did not provide support for the view that high rates of school

failure and non-employment in central city neighborhoods are due to the direct adverse effects of
living in a poor neighborhood. The pattern of findings was consistent with the results from the 47 year interim follow-up of MTO adults and youth (Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007). Our longterm data also showed no detectable impacts on academic achievement for children of pre-school
age at baseline even though MTO led to very large changes in their neighborhood conditions at a
life stage when they may be most developmentally malleable.
One obvious question involves generalizability: Do neighborhood changes have no
impact on earnings or educational achievement outcomes here because the MTO study sample is
somehow unusual? MTO families were drawn from extremely distressed communities. The
baseline census tracts for MTO families were fully 3 standard deviations above the national
average in the 2000 census tract-poverty distribution. On the other hand much of the scientific
and policy concern about “neighborhood effects” is precisely with families living in the most
distressed areas. And previous observational studies report finding impacts on samples similar to
the MTO sample.
Looking at broad indices of outcomes that were pre-specified for the interim MTO data,
we found suggestive (but not always statistically significant) signs that physical and mental
health outcomes improved for adult women and female youth. We found very large MTO

18

impacts on specific health measures, particularly those related to extreme obesity and diabetes.
Although we acknowledge that measuring candidate mechanisms like diet, exercise and access to
health care is intrinsically challenging, and that our available data on these factors are quite
limited, it is noteworthy that MTO moves reduced extreme obesity and diabetes by fully 40-50%
for adults while generating almost no detectable changes in our measures of these candidate
mediators. One hypothesis for why MTO improved physical health is because of MTO’s
beneficial impacts on neighborhood safety, and subsequent gains in mental health – including
psychological distress. This safety-stress-health hypothesis is also consistent with our finding
that the majority of MTO households signed up to move to new neighborhoods through MTO
because of concerns about crime and violence.
The long-term MTO data did not show any signs of the large drop in violent-crime arrests
that were found in the 4-7 year MTO follow-up among both male and female youth (Kling,
Ludwig, and Katz 2005). However the long-term data did echo the interim data to some extent in
showing female youth may benefit from MTO moves in other outcome domains like mental
health or risky behaviors, but male youth tended to do no better (or do worse) as a result of such
moves. The reason for these gender differences remains unclear; they do not seem to be due
merely to gender differences in the prevalence of these outcomes or behaviors.
The magnitudes of these gender differences in MTO impacts were smaller in the longterm than interim data, just as the difference across MTO groups in neighborhood conditions was
smaller at the time of the long-term surveys than interim surveys. These patterns suggest youth
outcomes may be more affected by contemporaneous neighborhood conditions than accumulated
exposure to neighborhood environments, or what Sampson (2012) calls “situational”
neighborhood effects as opposed to “developmental” neighborhood effects.

19

The MTO data make clear that neighborhood environments have important impacts on
the overall quality of life and well-being of low-income families despite the mixed pattern of
impacts on traditional “objective” outcome measures, including null effects on earnings and
education. Ludwig et al. (2012) showed that a 1 standard deviation decline in census tract
poverty rates (about 13 percentage points) was associated with an increase in SWB that is about
the same size as the difference in SWB between households whose annual incomes differ by
$13,000 – a very large amount given that the average control group family’s annual income in
the long-term survey was just $20,000.

APPENDIX FIGURE 3. INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND TRACT POVERTY RATE AND TRACT SHARE MINORITY

APPENDIX FIGURE 3. (continued)
Notes: The figure shows the instrumental variable estimation of the relationship between subjective well-being and average
(duration-weighted) tract poverty rate (panel A), tract share minority (panel B), tract poverty controlling for share minority
(panel C), and tract share minority share controlling for tract poverty (panel D). The y-axis is a 3-point happiness scale (1=not
too happy, 2=pretty happy, 3=very happy) expressed in standard deviation units relative to the control group. Share poor is the
fraction of census tract residents living below the poverty threshold. Share minority is the fraction of census tract residents who
are members of racial or ethnic minority groups. Tract shares are linearly interpolated from the 1990 and 2000 decennial census
and 2005-09 American Community Survey and are weighted by the time respondents lived at each of their addresses from
random assignment through May 2008. Share poor and minority are z-scores, standardized by the control group mean and
standard deviation. The points represent the site (Bal = Baltimore, Bos = Boston, Chi = Chicago, LA = Los Angeles, NY = New
York City) and treatment group (E = Experimental group, S = Section 8 group, C = control group). The slope of the line is
equivalent to a 2SLS estimate of the relationship between subjective well-being and the mediator shown in each panel, using
interactions of indicators for MTO treatment group assignment and demonstration site as instruments for the mediator
(controlling for site indicator main effects). The estimated impact of 1sd decrease in poverty (Panel A) is a 0.129sd increase in
SWB (SE=0.054, P=0.017), and The estimated impact of 1sd decrease in poverty controlling for minority share (Panel C) is a
0.255sd increase in SWB (SE=0.095, P=0.008), and the estimated impact of 1sd decrease in minority share controlling for
poverty (Panel D) is a 0.289sd decrease in SWB (SE=0.176, P=0.101). The p-value from an F test of whether the coefficients
on poverty and minority share are the same (that is, whether the slope in panel C equals the slope in panel D) is 0.036.
Source and Sample: The sample is all adults who were interviewed as part of the long-term survey with non-missing subjective
well-being and duration-weighted census tract characteristics data (N=3,263).

Notes : All values represent shares. Values are calculated using sample weights to account for changes in
random assignment ratios across randomization cohorts, for survey sample selection, and for two-phase
interviewing. Missing values were imputed based on randomization site and whether randomized through
1997 or in 1998. The baseline head of household reported on the neighborhood characteristics listed
here. Analysis control variables not listed include whether the adult was part of the first survey release
and whether education level is missing. An omnibus F-test fails to reject the null hypothesis that the set
of baseline characteristics presented above is the same for both the control group and the randomly
assigned housing voucher treatment groups (p-value for the Experimental vs. control comparison is
P=0.442; and p-value for the Section 8 vs. control comparison is P=0.229).
Source and Sample : Baseline survey. The sample is all adults interviewed as part of the long-term
survey (N=3,273).
*** Significant at the 1 percent level on an independent group t-test of the difference between the control
group and the Experimental group or the Section 8 group.

Notes : All values represent shares. Values are calculated using sample weights to account for changes in
random assignment ratios across randomization cohorts, for survey sample selection, and for two-phase
interviewing. Missing values were imputed based on randomization site and whether randomized through 1997
or in 1998. The baseline head of household reported on all youth characteristics listed here. At baseline, older
youth were ages 6 to 11 and younger youth were ages 0 to 5. The youth analysis includes all control variables
listed in Appendix Table 1 (except for the survey release flag) as well as those listed in this table and flags for
missing data for several characteristics listed above (gifted student, suspended/expelled, behavioral problems,
learning problems, hospitalization, low birth weight, read to by household member, activity-limiting health
problems).
Source and Sample : Baseline survey. The sample is all youth ages 15-20 as of December 2007 interviewed as
part of the long-term survey (N=3,621).
** Significant at the 5 percent level on an independent group t-test of the difference between the control group
and the Experimental group or the Section 8 group.

Notes : CM, control mean; ITT, intent-to-treat, from ordinary least squares regression; TOT, treatment-on-treated, from two-stage least squares regression instrumenting
treatment compliance; CCM, control complier mean. The estimated equations all include treatment indicators and the baseline covariates listed in Appendix Table 1. Robust
standard errors are in parentheses. The concentrated disadvantage index is a weighted combination of census tract percent [i] poverty, [ii] on welfare, [iii] unemployed, [iv]
female-headed family households, and [v] under age 18, with loading factors developed using 2000 Census tracts in Chicago by Sampson, Sharkey, and Raudenbush
(2008), but does not include percent African-American. The local area crime rate data were refined after the publication of Ludwig (2012), but these results do not
substantively differ from those in the earlier publication. The safety measure reflects whether the respondent felt unsafe or very unsafe (vs. safe or very safe) in the
neighborhood during the day. Housing problems include peeling paint, broken plumbing, rats, roaches, broken locks, broken windows, and broken heating system.
Source and Sample : Self-reported measures come from the adult long-term survey. Census tract characteristics are interpolated data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial
censuses as well as the 2005-09 American Community Survey. The sample is all adults interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=3,273).

Notes : E
regression of each outcome on treatment indicators and the baseline covariates listed in Appendix Tables 1 and 1B. In columns (v)–(x), gender is interacted with
the treatment indicators and baseline covariates described above. M − F Youth is male − female difference. Robust standard errors (adjusted for household
clustering in the youth analysis) are in parentheses. Index components are as follows (positive outcomes (+) were included as is, while the signs for negative
outcomes (−) were reversed so that higher index values indicate "better" outcomes): Adult economic self-sufficiency: + adult employed and not on TANF +
employed + 2009 earnings − on TANF − 2009 government income. Adult mental health: − distress index − depression − Generalized Anxiety Disorder +
calmness + sleep. Adult physical health: − self-reported health fair/poor − asthma attack past year – obesity − hypertension − trouble carrying/climbing. Youth
physical health: − self-reported health fair/poor − asthma attack past year − overweight − nonsports injury past year. Youth mental health: − distress index −
depression − Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Youth risky behavior: − marijuana past 30 days − smoking past 30 days − alcohol past 30 days − ever pregnant or
gotten someone pregnant. Youth education: + graduated high school or still in school + in school or working + Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyKindergarten cohort study (ECLS-K) reading score + ECLS-K math score. For adults, the index for all outcomes includes the 15 measures in the selfsufficiency, physical health, and mental health indices. For youth, the index for all outcomes includes the 15 measures in the physical health, mental health, risky
behavior, and education indices.
Source and Sample : The sample is all adults and youth aged 15-20 (as of December 2007) who were interviewed as part of the long-term survey. Sample sizes
in the E, S, and C groups are 1,456, 678, and 1,139 for adults and 1,437, 1,031, 1,153 for youth.

B. Administrative data

Notes : CM, control mean; ITT, intent-to-treat, from ordinary least squares regression; TOT, treatment-on-treated, from two-stage least squares regression instrumenting
treatment compliance; CCM, control complier mean. The estimated equations all include treatment indicators and the baseline covariates listed in Appendix Table 1. Robust
standard errors are in parentheses. Rows shown in the table are the components of the economic self-sufficiency index described in the notes to Table 1. TANF denotes
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The administrative data effects were calculated using a slightly different estimation approach, pooling all three groups and
including indicators for both treatments (whereas the survey data effects were estimated via separate regressions for the two treatments). Differences between estimation
approaches are minimal.
Source and Sample : The survey data sample is all adults interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=3,273). The administrative data sample is adults from all MTO
households for whom consent to administrative data collection was available (N=4,194).

Notes : CM, control mean; ITT, intent-to-treat, from ordinary least squares regression; TOT, treatment-on-treated, from two-stage least squares regression instrumenting
treatment compliance; CCM, control complier mean. The estimated equations all include treatment indicators and the baseline covariates listed in Appendix Table 1.
Robust standard errors are in parentheses. Panel A and the first five rows in panel B are the components of the mental and physical health indices in Table 1 (effects on the
depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder components of the mental health index are withheld). The effects on body mass index (BMI) and diabetes represent key
findings from earlier work. Psychological distress consists of 6 items (sadness, nervousness, restless, hopelessness, feeling that everything is an effort, worthlessness) scaled
on a score from 0 (no distress) to 24 (highest distress) and then converted to a z-score using the mean and standard deviation for control group adults. Hypertension is high
blood pressure based on systolic 140 mm Hg or diastolic 90 mm Hg. BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (BMI 30 indicates obesity, 35
indicates severe obesity, 40 indicates extreme obesity). Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level is from a blood sample, and a level 6.5% indicates diabetes.
Source and Sample : The sample is all adults interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=3,273).

squares regression of each outcome on treatment indicators and the baseline covariates listed in Appendix Table 1. Impacts by age at baseline were estimated as an interaction
with treatment status. Difference by age is age 33 and over − under age 33. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. Panels A and B and the first five rows in panel C are the
components of the economic self-sufficiency, physical health, and mental health indices in Table 1 (effects on the depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder components
of the mental health index are withheld). The effects on body mass index (BMI) and diabetes represent key findings from earlier work. Psychological distress consists of 6
items (sadness, nervousness, restless, hopelessness, feeling that everything is an effort, worthlessness) scaled on a score from 0 (no distress) to 24 (highest distress) and then
converted to a z-score using the mean and standard deviation for control group adults. Hypertension is high blood pressure based on systolic 140 mm Hg or diastolic 90
mm Hg. BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (BMI 30 indicates obesity, 35 indicates severe obesity, 40 indicates extreme obesity).
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level is from a blood sample, and a level 6.5% indicates diabetes.
Source and Sample : The sample is all adults interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=3,273).

Notes : Coefficient estimates for the various instrumental variable regressions shown use site and treatment group
interactions as instruments. Each regression also controlled for the baseline covariates presented in Appendix Table 1 and
for field release and was weighted. Columns labels are as follows: 2SLS columns report results for two-stage least
squares, LIML is an unmodified limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) model, and columns labeled Fuller
present Fuller-modified LIML models with constants 1, 2 and 4, respectively. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.
All measures were converted to z-scores using the control group mean and standard deviation. See the notes to Table 1 for
a description of the indices. Subjective well-being (SWB) scale refers to the 3-point happiness scale (1=not too happy,
2=pretty happy, 3=very happy). Share poor is the fraction of census tract residents living below the poverty threshold, and
share minority is the fraction of census tract residents who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups. Both share
poor and share minority are average measures weighted by the amount of time respondents lived at each of their addresses
between random assignment and May 31, 2008 (just prior to the start of the long-term survey fielding period).
Source and Sample : SWB and the index components were self-reported or measured on the MTO long-term survey.
Share poor and share minority come from interpolated data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial census as well as the 200509 American Community Survey. The sample is all adults interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=3,273).

squares regression of each outcome on treatment indicators and the baseline covariates listed in Appendix Tables 1 and 1B. Impacts by gender were estimated as an
interaction with treatment status. M − F difference is male − female difference. Robust standard errors adjusted for household clustering are in parentheses. Rows shown in
the table are the components of the mental health, physical health, education, and risky behavior indices in Table 2 (effects on the depression and Generalized Anxiety
Disorder components of the mental health index are withheld). Psychological distress consists of 6 items (sadness, nervousness, restless, hopelessness, feeling that
everything is an effort, worthlessness) scaled on a score from 0 (no distress) to 24 (highest distress) and then converted to a z-score using the mean and standard deviation
for control group youth ages 15-20 (with male and female youth standardized separately). Body mass index (BMI) values greater than the 95th percentile indicate
overweight for youth. Educationally on track indicates the youth was currently in school or had received a high school diploma or certificate of General Educational
Development (GED). Assessment scores are from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K) cohort study assessments adapted for the MTO study. The
math and reading achievement assessment measures were converted to z-scores as described above for the psychological distress index. The overweight finding is sensitive
to the measure used: the intent-to-treat effects for females presented above and those for the overall physical health index presented in Table 2 and Appendix Table 3 are
not quite statistically significant when using cutoffs from the International Obesity Task Force as presented in Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011).
Source and Sample : The sample is youth ages 15-20 as of December 2007 interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=3,621).

Notes : Coefficient estimates for the various instrumental variable regressions shown use site and treatment group
interactions as instruments. Each regression also controlled for the baseline covariates presented in Appendix Tables 1
and 1B and for field release and was weighted. Columns labels are as follows: 2SLS columns report results for two-stage
least squares, LIML is an unmodified limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) model, and columns labeled
Fuller present Fuller-modified LIML models with constants 1, 2 and 4, respectively. Robust standard errors adjusted for
household clustering are in parentheses. All measures were converted to z-scores using the mean and standard deviation
for control group youth ages 15-20 (with male and female youth standardized separately). See the notes to Table 2 for a
description of the indices. Share poor is the fraction of census tract residents living below the poverty threshold, and
share minority is the fraction of census tract residents who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups. Both share
poor and share minority are average measures weighted by the amount of time respondents lived at each of their
addresses between random assignment and May 31, 2008 (just prior to the start of the long-term survey fielding period).
Source and Sample : Share poor and share minority come from interpolated data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial
census as well as the 2005-09 American Community Survey, and the index measures are from the long-term survey. The
sample is all youth ages 15-20 as of December 2007 who were interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=3,621).

Notes : Coefficient estimates for the various instrumental variable regressions shown use site and treatment group interactions
as instruments. Each regression presents coefficients for the respective neighborhood measure controlling for the other
mediator listed. Each regression also controlled for the baseline covariates presented in Appendix Tables 1 and 1B and for
field release and was weighted. Columns labels are as follows: 2SLS columns report results for two-stage least squares,
LIML is an unmodified limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) model, and columns labeled Fuller present Fullermodified LIML models with constants 1, 2 and 4, respectively. Robust standard errors adjusted for household clustering are
in parentheses. All measures were converted to z-scores using mean and standard deviation for control group youth ages 1520 (with male and female youth standardized separately). See the notes to Table 2 for a description of the indices. Share poor
is the fraction of census tract residents living below the poverty threshold, and share minority is the fraction of census tract
residents who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups. Both share poor and share minority are average measures
weighted by the amount of time respondents lived at each of their addresses between random assignment and May 31, 2008
(just prior to the start of the long-term survey fielding period).
Source and Sample : Share poor and share minority come from interpolated data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial census as
well as the 2005-09 American Community Survey, and the index measures are from the long-term survey. The sample is
male youth ages 15-20 as of December 2007 who were interviewed as part of the long-term survey (N=1,776).
