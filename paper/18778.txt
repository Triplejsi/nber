Profitability of Fertilizer: Experimental Evidence from Female Rice Farmers in Mali

ABSTRACT
In an experiment providing fertilizer grants to women rice farmers in Mali, we found that women who
received fertilizer increased both the quantity of fertilizer they used on their plots and complementary
inputs such as herbicides and hired labor. This highlights that farmers respond to an increase in availability
of one input by re-optimizing other inputs, making it challenging to isolate the returns to any one input.
We also found that while the increase in inputs led to a significantly higher level of output, we find
no evidence that profits increased. Our results suggest that fertilizer's impact on profits is small compared
to other sources of variation. This may make it difficult for farmers to observe the impact of fertilizer
on their plots, and accordingly this affects their ability to learn about the returns to fertilizer and could
affect their decision to adopt even in the absence of credit constraints.

Profitability of fertilizer: Experimental evidence from female rice
farmers in Mali
By Lori Beaman, Dean Karlan, Bram Thuysbaert and Christopher Udry∗

about 30% of women use fertilizer, even
with government price subsidies of around
33-43% (depending on the specific fertilizer).

Intensified use of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizer, is a possible route to improved agricultural productivity. Field trials of these technologies show substantial
increases in yields, but typically are done on
highly monitored experimental plots rather
than by farmers themselves.
Returns to a certain technology might
be quite different on real-world farms than
on experimental farms, particularly when
farmers must re-optimize multiple inputs in
response to a new technology. Suri (2011)
argues that not all farmers benefit from fertilizer use, despite there being high average
returns. Behavioral biases may also prevent
farmers from realizing their intentions to
use fertilizer (Duflo, Kremer and Robinson,
2011). We use a simple field experiment to
provide free fertilizer to women rice farmers
in southern Mali to measure how farmers
choose to use the fertilizer, what changes
they make to their agricultural practices,
and the profitability of this set of changes.
Rice is an important crop in the study
area. It is almost exclusively farmed on
women-controlled plots. The technology
is low-input intensive and is “broadcast”
farmed on non-irrigated flood planes: seeds
are literally scattered loosely into a plot,
rather than small plants transplanted from
nurseries to rows in the plot. The rice production is mostly used for own consumption. Fertilizer is recommended by local
agricultural extension agents and believed
to substantially increase yields (Government of Mali, 2009). Nevertheless, only

Africa’s fertilizer rates and yields are
lower than any other region. The women
in our sample in southern Mali are above
the average for fertilizer usage for Africa,
using about 38 kg/ha of fertilizer, but they
only achieve yields of around 1,600 kg/ha.
In contrast, the irrigated zone within Mali
has fertilizer per hectare rates of about 113
kg/ha and achieves yields of about 4,500
kg/ha. The lack of water control in the
study area is a significant limitation. A
similar, if even larger, gap exists between
Africa and the rest of the world for other
cereal crops such as maize.
Our experiment had two treatment
groups: those who received the full recommended quantity of fertilizer per hectare,
and those who received half of the recommended quantity per hectare. We find
that treatment increased the likelihood that
women used fertilizer and increased the
quantity of fertilizer used on their plots.
They also report using more complementary inputs such as labor and herbicides.
From a methodological perspective, this
highlights a challenge in measuring the returns to a given input. In this case, farmers
change other complementary inputs making

it difficult to isolate the returns to fertilizer.
This is a general and familiar point: a discrete change in the price or availability of
one input may induce agents to re-optimize
in potentially many dimensions; it is not in
general possible to isolate the technical returns to varying that input alone. Instead,
we are able to estimate the returns to a policy of fertilizer distribution. This basic tension between measuring returns to a specific
input and determining the impact of a policy plagues most empirical studies in this
literature.
As a consequence of the increased input
use, rice output increases by 31% on average, an increase we measure with statistical
precision. However, we do not measure any
increase in agricultural profits. The point
estimate of the effect of this increased input
intensity on profits is very close to zero, but
the precision of the estimates is low. The
confidence interval includes the estimates
of the most profitable quantity of fertilizer
examined by Duflo, Kremer and Robinson
(2008). However, the noise of the estimates
in a real world environment highlights a potential constraint on farmers’ fertilizer use:
it may simply be difficult to learn about the
returns to fertilizer for a particular farmer,
given their land quality and other inputs,
when the signal is small and there are large
fluctuations in profits due to other shocks.
I.

Research design and data

The fertilizer experiment was conducted
in 23 villages in the district of Bougouni
of southern Mali. In spring 2010, we conducted a census of female farmers in the
selected villages, randomly sampled one
woman per household and conducted a
baseline survey. Detailed information was
collected on agricultural activities, other
economic activities, assets, consumption,
expenditures, etc. Of the 416 respondents
who were successfully interviewed, 383 cultivated rice in the agricultural season prior
to the survey. These 383 women constitute
our sample frame for the experiment.
Women were randomly assigned to one of
2 treatment cells or a control group: (1) 135
received the total recommended quantity

MAY 2013

per hectare, (2) 123 received half of the recommended quantity per acre, and (3) 125
were in the control group and received no
fertilizer.1 We contacted various research
institutes and extension agents within Mali
to determine the treatment content2 . The
recommended level of fertilizer is roughly in
line with the quantity of fertilizer used in
North America and Western Europe. The
half treatment is comparable to levels used
in Asia for rice. We used our GPS measures of rice plot areas to determine individual farmers’ plot sizes; the average rice
plot is small, 0.22 of a hectare. Table 2
shows the mean transfers made, with the
full treatment receiving on average 308.20
kg per hectare, and the half treatment receiving on average 156.20 kg per hectare3 .
In late May 2010, we bagged and labeled
the two fertilizer types and sent teams to
the villages to distribute the fertilizer to
the women in the treatment groups. We
also provided a short, 30 minute explanation of how to use the fertilizer. No further
training or monitoring was provided. A few
months later, in August 2010, we conducted
a first follow-up survey that focused on use
of inputs. We conducted a second followup survey immediately after the harvest in
December 2010. We were able to collect
follow-up data for 378 primary respondents
(out of 383).
1 Randomization

was done using a re-randomization
routine that stratified by village and guaranteed that for
all of the following variables the p values for the comparisons of means between any of the 3 groups were larger
than .5: whether or not there was an extended household, use of fertilizer, use of plough and an agricultural
asset index. These baseline characteristics are included
as controls in all regressions shown in Tables 3-4.
2 As a result of their advice we defined 200 kg of grain
fertilizer (Complexe céréale, a particular type of NPK)
and 100 kg of Urea per hectare as the full treatment
amount. The original recommended amounts, consistent with Mali’s agricultural subsidy program (Druilhe
and Barreiro-Huré, 2012), were 100 kg of di-ammonium
phosphate (DAP) and 150 kg of Urea. However, DAP
was not available - a frequent problem - in the project
area, so the local extension office recommended an alternative composition with fertilizer which was available.
3 There is variation in the amounts received per
hectare since for logistical reasons we put plot sizes into
buckets (i.e. less than 1500 square meters, between
1500 and 2500 square meters, etc.) and provided the
same quantity of fertilizer for all individuals in the same
bucket and treatment group.

Number of farmers

The experimental design differs from that
of Duflo, Kremer and Robinson (2008) from
Kenya in three main ways. First, in the
Kenya experiment, each farmer divided a
given plot into sections, applying fertilizer
on some parts and not on others. Second,
extension agents from the partner Kenya
NGO helped farmers apply the fertilizer,
monitored farmers, and assisted with harvest through crop cutting (which also lends
itself to more precise measures of output).
Third, in the Kenya experiment, other inputs were not formally measured4 . In our
experiment, women farmers were provided
just the fertilizer and a short training on
fertilizer. We returned months later to measure input use halfway through the agricultural cycle, and then finally after the harvest to measure output.
We thus report treatment effects from a
policy of fertilizer distribution done without
one-on-one monitoring nor extensive training. This design also reveals farmer choices
when their endowments of fertilizer are exogenously increased. Farmers may adjust
their behavior in response to the delivery of
fertilizer in a variety of ways, such as transferring to others, storing, selling, as well as
adjusting complementary inputs and effort.

Results

We investigate the effects of the fertilizer
transfers on input usage, output and profits. Given that treatment assignment was
4 In some of the trials, though, farmers were asked
about the time spent weeding, and farmers reported
weeding similar amounts on all segments of their plots.
Dividing up one parcel into several parts, along with the
instructions provided by the research team to not otherwise adjust their farming practices and the extension
agents’ monitoring, may have made farmers less likely
to change other inputs.

where i represents farmers, j represents villages, and t represents time (two time periods, before and after). The coefficients of
interest are β1 and β2 , capturing the effect
of the half and full treatment, respectively.
yij(t−1) is the lagged dependent variable,
xij(t−1) is the vector of baseline variables
used in the randomization routine, and δj
are village indicators since we stratified the
randomization by village5 . In Table A1 of
the web appendix, we show tests for orthogonality of assignment to treatment and a set
of input and outcome variables. For zero
out of 9 variables are we able to reject the
null hypothesis of equality at the 10% level.

treatment effects of 64 percentage points

used 13 kg of fertilizer, while the half treatment group used 21 kg more (se=4.10)
and the full treatment group used 33 kg
more (se=4.05). In the half treatment, the
women used up most or all of the fertilizer given to them. The women in the full
treatment used about 70%6 of the fertilizer
given to them, suggesting some fertilizer
was either stored, sold or shared with other
household members7 . This strong response

full treatment group used on average 46 kg
of fertilizer, compared to an average of 66 kg given to
women in that treatment group.
7 We asked about inter-household sales and transfers of fertilizer in the first follow-up survey. Only 3
treatment households reported either selling or giving
fertilizer to other households. We therefore believe that
most of the unused fertilizer was used by other household members or stored. We did not observe an increase
in fertilizer use on men’s plots or other women’s plots
in 2010. However, men’s plots are much larger on average than women’s plots so it would be very difficult
to detect a small, in relative terms, increase in fertilizer
used.

of fertilizer to women has important implications for our understanding of the economic organization of Malian households,
and for the analysis of agricultural input
and financial markets. Our focus in this
paper, however, is on the impact of this increased fertilizer use on complementary inputs and on output.
We observe no change in the amount of
family labor applied to women’s rice plots
(Table 3, Column 3). We find that a portion of the fertilizer grants replaces cash expenditure on fertilizer (Table 3, Column 4):
women in the half treatment spent 2,413
FCFA less on fertilizer (se = 537) and those
in the full treatment spent 3,012 FCFA less
(se = 532).
Other inputs were crowded-in from the
free fertilizer distribution. For herbicides
(Table 3, Column 5), we find about a 1,000
FCFA increase (se= 530 FCFA) for both
treatment groups, and expenses on hired
labor increased, but less so: 1,075 FCFA

(se=602) for the half treatment group and
2,353 FCFA (se=595) for the full treatment
group8 .
The total input expenses, excluding fertilizer and family labor, increased significantly for the full treatment group (1,705
FCFA, se=1140 for the half treatment;
3,004 FCFA, se=1130 for the full treatment). All in, Column 8 shows how the
provision of fertilizer, and women’s subsequent decisions on how to use the fertilizer
and other inputs, affected total inputs. Total inputs, including the value of fertilizer
used but excluding family labor, increased
substantially, almost as much as the transferred amounts (8,023 FCFA transferred
vs 7,061 FCFA increased inputs for the
half treatment; 16,427 FCFA transferred vs
11,451 FCFA increased inputs for the full
treatment).

average profits in the control group are very
low, and even negative on average. Column (4) uses a version of profits calculated
as the value of output minus the value of
just fertilizer in order to be comparable to
that used by Duflo, Kremer and Robinson
(2008), which overestimates the impact on
profits because other purchased inputs increased due to treatment. In all three cases,
we can not reject the null of no increase
in profits. The confidence interval is large.
A simple return on investment calculation,
dividing the change in profits from the full
treatment, as measured in column (2) of Table 4, by the change in inputs from the full
treatment (column (9) of Table 3), has a
90% confidence interval ranging from -0.48
to 0.46. Therefore the rates of returns of the
most profitable amounts of fertilizer in Duflo, Kremer and Robinson (2008) are contained in our confidence interval.

Output and profits

The increases in input usage led to a considerable increase in the value of output,
as shown in Column 1 of Table 4. Output is valued at producer prices at the time
of harvest, to avoid confounding a potential increase in profits from increased output with the returns to storage. The increase in output is 5,952 FCFA (se=3549) in
the half treatment group and 11,046 FCFA
(se=3505) in the full treatment group, compared to a control group mean of 35,920
FCFA, an increase of 17% and 31%, respectively.
However, columns (2)-(4) show that we
can not detect an increase in profits. Column (2) estimates a small but negative impact on profits (-1,101 FCFA, se=3254; 116 FCFA, se=3227, for the half and full
treatments, respectively), calculated as the
value of output minus the value of inputs
other than family labor. We can then think
of this definition of profits as including the
family’s wages for their labor plus the firm’s
profits. Column (3) also removes the value
of family labor from profits9 . Subsequently,
8 We did not observe changes in expenses on other
inputs such as seeds and ploughing.
9 We value family labor at a rate of 400 FCFA per
day. As in most places in West Africa, labor markets

The large confidence interval of course
partially reflects measurement error in the
survey. But it also highlights that there is
substantial variability in profits. For the
full treatment, the upper bound of the 95%
confidence interval for profits, as measured
in Column 2, is still only .2 of a standard
deviation. If the signal on the profitability
of fertilizer is weak relative to the noise resulting from weather variability, it will be
hard for farmers to learn about how much if any - fertilizer is optimal for them to use
on their particular plot of land given other
possible constraints they face on inputs (including labor, for example). Note that the
experiment induced a large increase in the
quantity of fertilizer used. A smaller increase in fertilizer, as would be more typical
for farmers experimenting, would be even
harder to detect10 .

are relatively thin, and it is challenging to price family
labor. This figure is based off of average wages paid to
women laborers participating in work groups, which is
the closest type of hired labor to family labor we observe
in rural labor markets in southern Mali.
10 We also investigated treatment effect heterogeneity along the dimension of farmer experience/skill. As
shown in the web appendix, we do not find evidence of
treatment effect heterogeneity on output nor profits.

Conclusion

An experiment providing fertilizer grants
to women rice farmers in Mali found that,
first, women who received fertilizer increased both the quantity of fertilizer they
used on their plots and complementary inputs such as herbicides and hired labor.
This highlights that farmers respond to an
increase in one input by re-optimizing other
inputs, making it challenging to isolate the
returns to any one input. Second, while
the increase in inputs led to a significantly
higher level of output, we find no evidence
that profits increased. Our results suggest that fertilizer’s impact on profits is
small compared to other sources of variation. This may make it difficult for farmers
to observe the impact of fertilizer on their
plots, and accordingly this affects their ability to learn about the returns to fertilizer
and could affect their decision to adopt even
in the absence of credit constraints.
