ABSTRACT
The low number of college graduates with science degrees -- particularly among under-represented
minorities -- is of growing concern. We examine differences across universities in graduating students
in different fields. Using student-level data on the University of California system during a period
in which racial preferences were in place, we show significant sorting into majors based on academic
preparation, with science majors at each campus having on average stronger credentials than their
non-science counterparts. Students with relatively weaker academic preparation are significantly more
likely to leave the sciences and take longer to graduate at each campus. We show the vast majority
of minority students would be more likely to graduate with a science degree and graduate in less time
had they attended a lower ranked university. Similar results do not apply for non-minority students.

Introduction
Increasing the number of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors is seen

as one of the key components to keeping the U.S. competitive in a global economy (Carnevale,
Smith, and Melton 2011).1 In a 2012 report, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science
and Technology suggested that the number of STEM majors needed to increase by 34% over
current rates to meet the demand for STEM professionals. The lack of STEM majors occurs
despite STEM majors earning substantially more than other college degrees with the exception
of perhaps business (Arcidiacono 2004, Kinsler and Pavan 2012, Melguizo and Wolniak 2012)
and that the STEM premium has increased over time (Gemici and Wiswall 2011).2
Of particular concern is the lack of representation of minority students (Council of Graduate
Schools 2007). Seymour and Hewitt (2000) point out that the National Science Foundation
alone has spent more than $1.5 billion to increase participation of minorities in the sciences,
and two programs at the National Institute of Health have invested $675 million in the same
endeavor. At college entry, black and Hispanic students exhibit preferences for STEM fields
that are similar to white preferences, yet their probabilities of persisting in these fields are much
lower (Anderson and Kim 2006). The data for the University of California system between 1995
and 1997 used in this study show similar patterns. Namely, the percentage of college enrollees
expressing an interest in science majors is 35% for both minorities and whites.3 Yet, 19% of
white enrollees complete a degree in the sciences with the corresponding number for minorities
at less than 11%. In a similar vein, among those who complete a degree in five years, 31% of
whites and 17% of minorities graduate with a STEM major.
While different programs have been implemented with the aim to reduce the current racial
disparities in shares of the U.S. workforce with STEM degrees, little is known about the role that
colleges play in “producing” STEM degrees, especially for underrepresented minority groups.
1

The importance of STEM majors has recently been highlighted in a Florida proposal to freeze tuition for
majors that are in high demand (Alvarez 2012) as a way of facilitating recovery from the recession. At the
same time, some schools charge high tuition for more lucrative majors, citing fairness issues and differences in
educational costs of different majors (Stange 2012).
2
Data on subjective expectations from a variety of schools indicates students are aware of the general differences in earnings across fields. See Arcidiacono, Kang, and Hotz (2012), Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2011),
Wiswall and Zafar (2012), and Zafar (forthcoming).
3
Asian students have a higher initial interest in the sciences at 51%.

2

An important exception is the study by Griffith (2010), who finds that characteristics of colleges
play a key role in the decision of students to remain in a STEM major and obtain a degree in
any of these fields. For example, she finds that students at selective colleges with large research
expenditures relative to total educational expenditures have lower persistence rates of students
in the sciences, especially minority students. In this regard, understanding campus disparities
in terms of the benefits and costs of producing STEM majors among minorities (and nonminorities) may have important implications for the way agencies, such as the National Science
Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), allocate resources across colleges in
the U.S. to increase the representation of minorities in such majors. Moreover, studying these
differences by types of colleges (e.g., more selective vs. less selective) among minorities can be
relevant to assess whether programs, such as affirmative action, improve minority representation
among STEM degree holders or hinder it by encouraging minority students to attend colleges
where success in STEM fields is unlikely.
In this paper, we make use of a rich database that contains information on applicants,
enrollees and graduates of baccalaureate programs at the various campuses within the University
of California (UC) system. These data include measures of students’ academic preparation,
intended major, and, conditional on graduating, their final major. The data reveal substantial
sorting across majors between freshmen and senior year. Those with SAT scores that are high
relative to the campus average are more likely to persist in a science major and graduate with
a science degree. This is especially true for minority students. For example, at UC Berkeley
minorities who persisted in the sciences had SAT scores over 100 points higher than those who
switched to a major outside of the sciences. For non-minority students the gap was only 30
points. These differences also are reflected in the likelihood of graduating. At UC Berkeley,
minority students who began in the sciences had less than a 31% probability graduating with a
science degree within five years, with the corresponding four-year graduation rate of 11%.
The differences across campuses in the rates of persistence in STEM majors and graduation
rates reflect, in part, differences across campuses in the academic preparation of their students.
But, they may also reflect campus differences in how academic preparation, especially in STEM
majors, translates into graduation. As we discuss below – and document in our empirical

3

analysis – while the more selective UC campuses (e.g., UC Berkeley and UCLA) have greater
success in graduating better prepared students in STEM fields, they are not as successful as
less-selective campuses (e.g., UC Riverside) in graduating less-prepared students in such majors.
We use data on minority and non-minority students4 who enrolled at one of the UC campuses
between 1995 through 1997 to estimate a model of students’ decision to graduate from college
with a particular major. We account for the initial selection into colleges via a Dale and Krueger
(2002) approach, taking advantage of the rich data on where students submitted applications
and where they were accepted. In addition, we allow campuses to differ in the attractiveness
of particular majors. We do so by allowing the returns to academic preparation to be specific
to the school and major combination. These returns are the combination of the reward in the
labor market net of the difficulty of the course work. Schools and majors that reward academic
preparation more than others will have relatively high persistence rates for those with high
levels of academic preparation but relatively low persistence rates for those with lower levels of
academic preparation.5
Estimates of the choice model reveal that the match between the student and the university
is an important component for persistence in STEM majors. Students with relatively low levels
of academic preparation will find majoring in a STEM field relatively less attractive at the most
selective schools.6 Our estimates suggest that the vast majority of minority students who begin
in the sciences at UC Berkeley would be more likely to graduate with a science degree had they
enrolled in a less-selective campus, such as UC Santa Cruz or UC Riverside.7 The potential
gains in minority graduation rates in the sciences from reallocating minority students are quite
4

Throughout this paper, minority students consist of African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans,
i.e., “under-represented minority groups” and non-minority students consist of whites and Asian Americans.
5
Clearly those with higher levels of academic preparation will be more likely to persist at all schools. However,
the school which makes it most likely that a particular student will graduate in a particular major may depend
on the academic preparation of the student.
6
Smyth and McArdle (2004) and Luppino and Sander (2012) also illustrate the importance of relative preparation in the choice of college major, finding that those who are significantly under-prepared are less likely to
persist in the sciences. What distinguishes our work is the importance of the matching of student preparation
with campus selectivity: students with strong (weak) academic characteristics are more likely to graduate in the
sciences at the more (less) selective campuses.
7
This finding is related to those in Arcidiacono (2005), who examines how the returns to college quality in
terms of subsequent earnings vary by a student’s choice of major. His estimates suggest that, while the returns
to college quality are slightly higher in the social sciences/humanities (but not education) than in the natural
sciences, the differences in the return to college quality are small relative to the differences in earnings across
majors.

large. For example, minorities from UC Berkeley that are in the bottom quartile of the SAT
score distribution would be twice as likely to graduate in the sciences at UC Santa Cruz or UC
Riverside as they are observed to do so at UC Berkeley.8 In contrast, non-minority students
that were enrolled at UC Berkeley would have had lower rates of persistence in the sciences if
they had attended the two lowest-ranked UC campuses (UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside).
That is, for the purposes of science graduation rates, non-minority students are well-matched.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data we use on
students who entered a UC campus in the falls of 1995, 1996 or 1997 and provide summary
statistics. We also document the across-campus differences in the rates at which minority
students persisted in and graduated with STEM and non-STEM majors. In Section 3 we
develop an econometric model of the decision of students to graduate in alternative majors or
not graduate when colleges differ in the net returns to students’ academic preparation. Section
4 shows model estimation results and presents counterfactual simulations. Section 5 concludes.

The Data and Descriptive Findings by Race across UC
Campuses

2.1

Majors and Graduation Rates

The data we use were obtained from the University of California Office of the President
(UCOP) under a California Public Records Act request. These data contain information on
applicants, enrollees and graduates of the UC system. The data are organized by years in which
these students would enter as freshmen. Due to confidentiality concerns, some individual-level
information was suppressed. In particular, the UCOP data have the following limitations:9

1. The data does not provide the exact year in which a student entered as a freshman, but
rather a three year interval.
2. The data provide no information on gender, and race is aggregated into four categories:
8

The fraction of minority students at Berkeley in the bottom quartile of the applicant distribution was 34%
for the years 1995-1997, the period of our study.

white, Asian, minority, and other.10
3. Academic data, such as SAT scores and high school grade point average (GPA), were only
provided as categorical variables, rather than the actual scores and GPAs.
Weighed against these limitations is having access to the universe of students who applied to at
least one campus in the UC system and also whether they were accepted or rejected at every
UC campus where they submitted an application.
Our analysis focuses on the choices and outcomes of minority and non-minority students
who enrolled at a UC campus during the interval 1995-1997. During this period, race-conscious
admissions were legal at all of California’s public universities. Starting with the entering class of
1998, the UC campuses were subject to a ban on the use affirmative action in admissions enacted
under Proposition 209.11 While available, we do not use data on the cohorts of students for this
later period (i.e. 1998-2005) as there is evidence that the campuses changed their admissions
selection criteria in order to conform with Prop 209.12
We begin by examining the differences across campuses in enrollments, graduation rates
and SAT scores by UC campus for both non-minority and minority students. Tabulations are
presented in Table 1, with the UC campuses listed according to the U.S. News & World Report
rankings as of the fall of 1997.13 Minorities made up 18.5% of the entering classes at UC
campuses during this period. The three campuses with the highest highest minority shares are
at the two most-selective universities (UCLA and UC Berkeley) and the least-selective university
(UC Riverside). A similar U-shaped pattern was found in national data in Arcidiacono, Khan,
and Vigdor (2011), suggesting diversity at the top campuses comes at the expense of diversity
of middle tier institutions.
We next examine the distribution of SAT scores across the campuses for minorities and
non-minorities.14 For both non-minority and minority students, the average test scores gen10

The other category includes those who did not report their race.
See Arcidiacono, Aucejo, Coate and Hotz (2012) for analyses of the effects of this affirmative action ban on
graduation rates in the UC system.

The 1997 U.S. News & World Report rankings of National Universities included 6 of the 8 UC campuses in
their Top 50: UC Berkeley (27); UCLA (31); UC San Diego (34); UC Irvine (37); UC Davis (40); and UC Santa
Barbara (47). Neither UC Santa Cruz or UC Riverside ranked in the Top 50 National Universities.

Table 1: Average SAT Scores and Graduation Rates by UC Campus & Minority Status, 1995-97

erally follow the rankings of the UC campuses. However, SAT scores for minority students
are substantially lower than their white counterparts at each campus, with the largest racial
gaps occurring at UC Berkeley (193) and UCLA (161). Moreover, the spread of scores across
campuses is greater for non-minorities (235 points) than it is for minority students (177 points).
Differences in the academic preparation of students across campuses appear to track differences in graduation rates, regardless of whether one looks at on-time graduation (in 4 years) or
5 year graduation rates. Non-minority students at UC Berkeley have 5-year graduation rates
that are almost 18 percentage points higher than minority students at UC Berkeley, while the
gap at UC Riverside is less than 3 percentage points. Differences in four-year graduation rates
are even starker, with 56.1% of non-minority students at UC Berkeley graduating in four years
compared to only 32.5% for minorities. Not withstanding the racial differences, the tabulations
in Table 1 indicate that, within each racial group, the top-ranked UC campuses tend to attract
students with better academic preparation and achieve higher graduation rates.
Table 1 also indicates that a substantial fraction of students intended to major in the sciences
when they entered college – 42.7% for non-minorities and 35.4% for minorities.15 However,
sizeable fractions of initial STEM majors end up switching to a different majors; 42.9% and
57.3% of non-minority and minority students who initially declared a STEM major ended up in
a non-science major by the time they graduated or dropped out of school. The racial difference in
switching is greatest at UC Berkeley and UCLA, the two most-selective campuses. For example,
almost two-thirds (65.1%) of minorities at UC Berkeley who initially declared themselves to be
science majors had switched out of science by the time they graduated or dropped out. As a
result of this lack of persistence in the sciences, only 17.2% of minorities that graduate from a UC
campus do so in the sciences, which is around 14 percentage points lower than the corresponding
share of non-minorities (31.2%).
sections of the SAT test. Rather, it provides only whether a student’s score on each section fell into one of the
following one of the following seven ranges: 200-449; 450-499; 500-549; 550-599; 600-649; 650-699; 700 or above.
We assigned students the midpoint of the range their score was in for the verbal and math tests, respectively,
and summed these values to get a student’s SAT score.
15
The difference in initial interests between minority and non-minority students is driven by Asians. White
students have the same initial interest in the sciences as minority students.

Persistence in the Sciences

Given these sizeable rates of switching out of science majors and the low graduation rates
in the sciences shown in Table 1, especially for minorities, we take a closer look at the acrosscampus and across-race differences in persisting and graduating with STEM majors. Table 2
displays both average SAT scores (top row) and the share of students (second row) for the
three completion categories (graduate in the sciences, graduate but not in the sciences, do not
graduate) by initial major and race for each campus, using completion status 5 years after
enrollment.
Table 2 shows significant sorting on academic preparation at UC campuses, with students
that graduate in the sciences having higher average SAT scores than those who do not, regardless
of initial major. SAT scores for non-minority students who persist in the sciences – i.e., start in
and graduate with a science major – are between 8 to 43 points higher than those who switch
to a non-science major. The differences are much larger for minority students. At each campus,
minority students who persist and graduate in the sciences have SAT scores that are between
27 and 115 points higher than those students who switch out of the sciences and graduate with
a non-science major. Moreover, as reflected in the rates of switching from the sciences in Table
1, non-minorities are much more likely to persist in and graduate with a degree in the sciences
than are minorities. For example, while 55% non-minorities who start in start in the sciences
at UC Berkeley graduate in that major, only 24.9% of minorities who start in the sciences do
so. This racial gap in persistence rates in the sciences, i.e., the share of students who remain
in a science major and graduate, shrinks with the selectivity of the UC campus. We also note
that switching into the sciences and graduating with a science degree is low for both racial
groups but is much lower for minority students, with gaps again largest at the top campuses.
While 9.2% of non-minority students in the non-sciences switch into the sciences, only 3.5% of
minority students do so.
It is also the case that students who start in science majors are less likely graduate from their
initial UC campus compared to those who start out in majors outside of the sciences. With
the exception of UC Berkeley, non-minority students whose initial major is in the sciences are
less likely to graduate than those whose majors are not in the sciences, despite those who start

out in the sciences having higher SAT scores. This shows the importance of the initial major,
both in its effect on the student’s final major and on whether the student graduates at all.
Differences in graduation rates between initial science and non-science majors are much starker
for minorities. Among non-minorities who start out in the sciences, 25.2% do not graduate;
in contrast, 40.7% of minorities who start out in the sciences do not graduate. For minorities,
those who begin in a non-science major are between 2.7 (for UC San Diego) and 10.5 (for UC
Santa Cruz) percentage points more likely to graduate in 5 years than those who start in a
non-science major, again despite the fact that those with initial science majors had higher SAT
scores.
Table 2 showed that persistence rates in the sciences were higher at the top campuses but
that these campuses also had higher average SAT scores. Similarly, persistence rates were higher
for non-minority students than minority ones, but this, too, may be the result of differences in
average SAT scores by race. We now take a first step towards separating out whether higher
persistence rates at top campuses are due to better students or due to something top campuses
are doing differently than the the less-selective campuses by breaking out persistence rates by
quartiles of the SAT score distribution.
We define the quartiles of the SAT score distribution based on all applicants to the UC system
between 1995 and 1997 regardless of whether the applicant attended or even was admitted to a
UC campus. Table 3 shows the share of minority and non-minority students in each quartile at
each institution. At each of the campuses, minority students are disproportionately represented
in the bottom quartile. Even at UC Berkeley, over 34% of minorities are in the bottom quartile
of the applicant SAT score distribution. The share of minority students in the bottom quartile
at UC Berkeley is actually higher than the share of non-minority students in the bottom quartile
at all institutions except for UC Riverside. In contrast, less than 3% of non-minority students at
UC Berkeley were in the bottom quartile with over 64% in the top quartile. As we move down
the selectivity/rankings of campuses, the share of both minority and non-minority students in
the bottom quartile rises, topping out at 78% for minority students and 44% for non-minority
students at UC Riverside.
Given the shares of non-minority and minority students in each SAT quartile, we now turn

to persistence rates conditional on institution and SAT quartile. Table 4 gives the results
for minority students. (The corresponding tabulations for non-minority students are found in
Table 12 in the Appendix.) The evidence indicates that minority students with low SAT scores
would be more likely to persist in the sciences if they attended a less-selective institution. For
example, minority students in the bottom quartile of the SAT score distribution who attended
UC Berkeley graduated in the sciences at a lower rate than similar students at UC Riverside,
despite those in the bottom quartile at UC Berkeley likely being stronger in other dimensions
(high school grades, parental education, etc.) than those in the bottom quartile at UC Riverside.
Note that the total graduation rate for initial science majors in the bottom quartile is actually
higher at UC Berkeley and UC Riverside. The primary difference is that at UC Berkeley many
of the students switch to non-science majors. Indeed, initial science majors in the bottom
quartile at UC Berkeley are close to five times as likely to graduate in the non-sciences than in
the sciences.
The results are different for minorities in the top quartiles, with those attending UC Berkeley
graduating at a higher rate in the sciences than those at UC Riverside. This is suggestive that
matching may be important – at least in the sciences – with top campuses being particularly
advantageous for those at the top of preparation distribution and less selective campuses being
more advantageous for those further down the preparation distribution. But beyond differences
across campuses, the reality is that those in the bottom quartiles of the SAT score distribution

12

have very low persistence rates in the sciences.
Table 4 also reinforces the point that an initial major in the sciences makes graduation in any
field in five years less likely, particularly for minorities in the bottom quartile of the SAT score
distribution. Overall, minorities in the bottom quartile with an initial major in the sciences
have graduation probabilities that are over eight percentage points lower than their non-science
counterparts. The similar gap for those in the top quartile is around four percentage points.
The corresponding results for non-minority students, displayed in Table 12 in the Appendix,
are very different. In particular, at all quartiles of the SAT score distribution non-minority
students are, on average, more likely to graduate in the sciences at UC Berkeley than at UC
Riverside, and are significantly more likely to graduate, regardless of major, at UC Berkeley than
at UC Riverside. These results for non-minority and minority students suggest that mismatch of
students with initial interests in STEM majors to UC campuses may be sizeable for minorities.
Moreover, this mismatch may be a consequence of affirmative action policies in which race as
well as academic preparation affect which campus students attend. At the same time, it would
be premature to ascribe any causal explanation of these racial differences in the share of students
graduating with science degrees since these tabulations do not account for selection, i.e. the fact
that the students at UC Berkeley are likely to be better prepared than those at UC Riverside.
The patterns of persistence in science majors and probabilities of graduating in any field are
even more striking if we instead examine 4-year graduation rates. Table 5 repeats the analysis
of Table 4, but this time examines 4-year graduation rates. (The corresponding results for nonminorities are recorded in Table 13 in the Appendix.) The probability that a minority in the
bottom quartile of the SAT score distribution who initially was interested in a science major
actually graduates in the sciences in four years at UC Berkeley is astonishingly low at 0.6% and
is substantially lower than the corresponding probability at UC Riverside. This again occurs
despite students at UC Berkeley having stronger academic preparation on other dimensions.16

16

Switching majors on average delays graduation. While 24% of those who graduated in five years had switched
majors, the corresponding share of those who graduated in four years was 20%.

Modeling Student Persistence in College Majors and
Graduation
The descriptive statistics in Section 2 suggest that the match between the academic prepa-

ration and the selectivity of the college may be important, particularly in the science and for
minorities. We now propose a model that is flexible enough to capture these matching effects.
We model a student’s decision regarding whether to graduate from college and, if they do, their
final choice of major. In particular, student i attending college k can choose to major and
graduate in a science field, m, or in a non-science field, h, or choose to not graduate, n. Denote
the student’s decision by dik , dik ∈ {m, h, n}. In what follows, the student’s initial choice of a
college, k is taken as given. Note that this introduces a selection problem: students at Berkeley
are likely strong not only on characteristics observed by the researcher but also along unobserved
dimensions. We discuss the selection problem in more detail in section 3.2.
We assume that the utility student i derives from graduating with a major in j from college
k depends on three components: (i) the net returns she expects to receive from graduating with
this major from this college; (ii) the costs of switching one’s major, if the student decides to
change from the one with which she started college; and (iii) other factors which we treat as
idiosyncratic and stochastic. The net returns from majoring in field j at college k, Rijk , is just the
difference between the expected present value of future benefits, bijk , of having this major/college
combination, less the costs associated with completing it, cijk , i.e., Rijk = bijk − cijk .17 In
particular, the benefits would include the expected stream of labor market earnings that would
accrue to someone with this major-college combination (e.g., an engineering degree from UC
Berkeley), where these earnings would be expected to vary with a student’s ability and the
quality of training provided by the college.
The costs of completing a degree in field j at k depend on the effort a student would need to
exert to complete the curriculum in this major at this college, where this effort is likely to vary
with i’s academic preparation and the quality of the college and its students. With respect to
switching costs, each student arrives on campus with an initial major, j int (as with the college
17

For a similar approach to modeling the interaction between colleges and majors in determining college
graduations in particular majors, see Arcidiacono (2004).

16

she attends, her initial, or intended, major, j int , is taken as given). The student may remain in
and graduate with her initial major or may decide to switch to and graduate with a different
major in which case the switching cost, Cijk , is paid. Finally, we allow for an idiosyncratic taste
factor, ijk . It follows that the payoff function for graduating with major j at school k is given
by:
Uijk = Rijk − Cijk + ijk

(1)

for j ∈ {m, h}. Below, we characterize the specific functional forms for Rijk and Cijk that we
use in estimation.
Since discrete choice models depend on differences in payoffs, without loss of generality we
normalize the student’s utility of not graduating from college k, denoted as Uink , to zero. It
follows that the major/graduation choice of student i attending college k is made according to:
dik = arg max {Uimk , Uihk , 0}
m,h,n

3.1

(2)

Net Returns

We assume that the net returns of a particular major/college combination, Rijk , varies with
an index of a student’s academic preparation for major j, denoted by AIij , and that these net
returns to AIij may differ across campuses. In particular, we assume that Rijk is characterized
by the linear function:
Rijk = φ1jk + φ2jk AIij

(3)

The specification in (3) allows college-major combinations to differ in their net returns to the
academic index with higher net returns associated with higher values of φj . As noted above,
such differences in φ2jk may result from colleges gearing their curriculum in a particular major to students from a particular academic background which, in turn, produce differences in
subsequent labor market earnings. Degrees in various majors from different colleges also may
produce differing net returns that do not depend on a student’s academic preparation which
is reflected in differing values of φ1jk . For example, the curriculum in majors at some colleges
17

(e.g., engineering at MIT) may have different course requirements that all students have to
meet, regardless of their academic preparation, that impose differing effort and time costs to
completing the major.
We are interested in how differences across colleges of differing quality, or selectivity, differ
in their ability to educate and graduate students of differing academic preparation in various
majors. To see how the specification of the net returns functions in (3) capture such differences,
suppose that College A is an elite, selective college (e.g., UC Berkeley, UCLA or UC San Diego),
while College B is a less selective one (e.g., UC Santa Cruz or UC Riverside). One possibility
is that highly selective colleges (A) have an absolute advantage relative to less selective ones
(B) in the net returns students from any level of academic preparation would receive and that
such advantage is true for all majors. This case is illustrated in Panel (a) of Figure 1, where
the absolute advantage holds for all majors. Alternatively, selective colleges may not generate
higher net returns for students with all levels of academic preparation in all fields. For example,
selective colleges may have an absolute advantage in moving all types of students through
its science curriculum, whereas less selective colleges (B) may have an absolute advantage
in training students in the humanities. This case is characterized by Panels (a) and (b) in
which elite colleges (A) have absolute advantage in getting students through major j, while
less selective colleges (B) have an absolute advantage in graduating all students from major
(j 0 ). This second case might arise if colleges develop faculties and facilities to educate students
in some majors, but not others, such as “technology institutes” (e.g., Caltech, Georgia Tech)
which focus on their curriculum and research in science and technology.
But some colleges may produce higher net returns in some major j for less-prepared students,
while others are geared to better-prepared students and produce higher net returns for the latter
type of student. This case is illustrated in Panel (c) for major j. At first glance, this differencesin-relative-advantage between highly selective and less selective colleges may account for the
differential success UC Berkeley and UCLA had in graduating minorities versus non-minorities
with STEM majors compared to lesser-ranked UC campuses, like UC Santa Barbara and UC
Riverside. Below, we examine the empirical validity of this latter explanation, after explicitly
accounting for differences in student preparation and student persistence in majors across the

3.2

Academic Preparation for Majors

We now specify how the student’s academic index is constructed. We assume that the various
abilities of the student can be characterized by a set of characteristics Xi . These characteristics

19

are then rewarded in majors differently. For example, math skills may be rewarded more in the
sciences while verbal scores may be more rewarded outside of the sciences. The academic index
for major j ∈ {m, h}, AIij , is then given by:
AIij = Xi βj

(4)

where βj allows for the weights on the various measures of preparation to vary by major.
Our estimation problem is analogous to that in the literature concerning the effects of college
quality on graduation and later-life outcomes. In particular, whether a student remains in a
major and graduates from a particular college is the result of student decisions that are influenced
by the quality of the campus – in our case the campus-specific net returns to graduating with
a major and the costs of switching a major – and by observed and unobserved dimensions of
her academic preparation. To account for the selection effects in our context, we employ the
approach used by Dale and Krueger (2002) by constructing a set of academic indices for each
student that depend not only on observables, such as SAT math and verbal scores, but also
on dimensions not fully captured by such measures but that are reflected in where a student
applied and the rankings/quality of UC campuses to which she was admitted. The full set of
characteristics, Xi , is given by: observed measures of academic preparation (Hi ), which includes
high school GPA, and SAT math and verbal scores; parental background (Bi ), which includes
dummy variables for each family income category and each parental education category; dummy
variables for each of the schools in the UC system where the individual submitted an application,
where sik = 1 if the individual submitted an application to school k and zero otherwise; and an
indicator variable of whether the individual was admitted to school k, aik . That is:
Xi =

h

Hi Bi Si Ai

i

where:
Si =

Ai =

The academic index for individual i in major j, AIij , is then given by a major-specific weighted
average of the characteristics in Xi as in (4). In this way, we allow the possibility that characteristics such as SAT math may be more important for science majors than non-science majors.

Costs of Switching Majors

Finally, we specify the cost of switching majors, Cijk . We allow these costs to depend on
the individual’s academic index (AIij ), a set of variables, Bi , that contain measures of parental
support such as parental income and education, and a college specific component, α3k .

Estimation

We specify the error structure such that it has a nested logit form, allowing the errors to
be correlated among the two graduation options, i.e., graduating with a science major (m) and
graduating with a non-science degree (h). In this way we account for shocks after the initial
choice of school and major that may influence the value of continuing one’s education. For
example, a shock to one’s finances or personal issues may make college in general unattractive.
Given our assumption regarding the error distribution, the probability of choosing to graduate
from k with major j, conditional on X and B (but not ), is given by:

Results
In this section we present estimates of the model of graduation/major choices. By modeling

these choices, we attempt to account for cross-campus differences in academic preparation. To
assess the consequences of adjusting for selection, we then examine how persistence in majors and
overall graduation rates would differ from the rates presented in Section 2 if student academic
preparation were equalized across the UC campuses. Finally, we calculate changes in STEM
graduations for minority (and non-minority) students from reallocating students across the UC
campuses. As we show below, these exercises imply sizeable gains in STEM major graduations
among minorities from reallocating students, especially less-prepared ones, from higher-ranked
UC campuses to lower-ranked ones.
Estimates of the key parameters of based on graduation in 5 or less years for minorities and
non-minorities are given in Table 6.18 We present estimates for the parameters of the net return
functions in (3), the switching majors cost function in (5) and some of the indices of students’
academic preparation from (4) for science and non-science majors.19
Consider first the estimates for the indices of academic preparation found in Table 6. Among
non-minorities, there are notable differences in the relative importance of particular measures
of academic preparation across the two majors, with the SAT Math score being important for
Science majors, while SAT verbal is more important for the non-sciences. A student’s high
school GPA is important for both majors, but is relatively more important for Science than
non-science. Similar patterns hold for minorities, although only the positive effect of SAT Math
scores on the preparation index for science majors is precisely estimated.20
The coefficient estimates for the net returns function are displayed in Table 6. Note that
the estimated campus intercepts and slope coefficients for the specification in (3) are measured
18

The corresponding parameter estimates for data on four-year graduation rates are found in Table 14 in the
Appendix and show similar patterns.
19
The full model has 144 parameters. For ease of exposition, we do not report the coefficients in the academic
index or the switching costs for each family income and parental education category. Nor do we report the Dale
and Krueger controls.
20
The lack of precision is driven by the flexibility of our specification. For example, using a less flexible function
for the returns to parental income education, as opposed to dummying out each category, results in statistically
significant effects for the main academic measures.

All campus dummies are measured relative to UC Berkeley (the omitted category).
The coefficient on AI for Berkeley is normalized to one.

23

relative to those for UC Berkeley (the slope for UC Berkeley is normed to one). We make
three points about how the net returns functions vary with student academic preparation (AIj ).
First, not surprisingly, the net returns to graduating with either major increase with AIj for
minorities and non-minorities.21 Second, the net returns to academic preparation (the φ2jk s)
are larger for higher-ranked campuses, such as UC Berkeley and UCLA, compared to those for
lower-ranked ones. This “return to college quality” holds for graduating with either a science
or non-science major and for minorities and non-minorities. Third, our estimates for the net
returns functions imply that, while higher ranked UC campuses like UC Berkeley and UCLA
have a comparative advantage in graduating better prepared minority or non-minority students
in either science or non-science majors relative to lower-ranked campuses, like UC Santa Cruz
and UC Riverside, the lower-ranked campuses have a comparative advantage in graduating lessprepared students especially in the sciences. This is reflected in the positive intercept terms
in the first panel when comparing all campuses except UCLA to UC Berkeley. This pattern
is consistent with the relationship among colleges of different ranks illustrated in Panel (c)
of Figure 1. Moreover, although not obvious from the coefficients themselves, the range of
AIj scores for which lower-ranked campuses have this comparative advantage is greater in the
sciences than in the non-sciences. These final two patterns suggest the potential for improving
persistence rates of minorities in the sciences by re-allocating students from higher ranked to
lower-ranked campuses. We develop this point in Section 4.2.
Finally, we turn to the estimates of the campus-specific components of the switching majors
cost function in Table 6. Again these campus components are measured relative to those for
UC Berkeley, which is normalized to zero. In contrast to the net returns, the costs of switching
majors are not ordered according to campus rankings and differ by minority status. Among
non-minorities, the costs of switching majors is highest at UC Berkeley but there is no pattern
to the remaining coefficients. In contrast, minorities at Berkeley have similar switching costs to
those at other campuses. Those only exception is UC Santa Barbara, which has slightly higher
switching costs.

21

The average of the campus-specific slopes of the net returns functions are remarkably similar, with 0.87
being the average for minorities of graduating with a science major and 0.77 for non-minorities and 0.89 being
the average for minorities of graduating with a non-science major and 0.86 for non-minorities.

4.1

Adjusting for Selection and Equalizing Across-Campus Student
Differences

To further characterize the consequences of adjusting for selection for the across-campus
differences in persistence and graduation rates of minorities and minorities, we use the parameters of our model to predict these campus-specific rates for a common set of students, with
the predictions then purged of selection. More precisely, we use the parameter estimates in
Tables 6 and 14 to predict the shares of students who would graduate, in 5 and 4 years or less
respectively, with a science major (di = m), a non-science major, (di = h), and any major
(di = m or di = h) at each UC campus for each initial-major (j int ) and SAT score quartile
(Q) “cell.” Here we use all students who enrolled at one of the UC campuses and who are of
that particular initial major and SAT score quartile. By using the same students in each cell
to predict these shares for each campus, the resulting estimates are purged of the within-pair
differences in students’ observed measures of academic preparation and family background that
characterized the actual shares found in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The selection-adjusted
predicted shares based on a 5-year graduation criteria are found in Table 7 and in Table 8 for
the 4-year graduation criteria. To facilitate their comparison with the observed (unadjusted)
shares, the results in these tables are displayed in much the same format as is used in Tables 4
and 5.
We focus initially on the selection-adjusted shares for minorities in Table 7 that are based
on the 5-year graduation criteria. In addition to the predicted shares by initial major and SAT
quartile, we include in this table tabulations of the average differences in the selection-adjusted
versus actual shares for each UC campus (“Ave. Diff.”) and of a measure of the differences in the
across-campus heterogeneity of the shares (“Diff. in Across-Campus Hetero.”) for each quartile
of the distribution of SAT scores.22 For almost every initial-major–SAT-quartile cell, adjusting
for selection and equalizing the within initial-major–SAT-quartile cells student characteristics
results in less across-campus heterogeneity in minority persistence rates in the sciences and nonsciences and in overall graduation rates compared to the shares actually observed at the UC
campuses. More precisely, equalizing the within-cell differences in student academic preparation
22

We use the coefficient of variation of shares for each SAT quartile to measure across-campus heterogeneity.
Note that this does not take into account differences in the size of the quartiles in the actual data.

25

and family background would tend to reduce the persistence rates at the higher ranked campuses
and to increase them at the lower-ranked campuses. There are two notable exceptions to this
pattern. Equalizing student preparation and family background of minorities would actually
increase the across-campus heterogeneity in science persistence rates and the share of students
switching into the sciences for those students in the bottom SAT quartile. This is due to the
strong comparative advantage that less-selective campuses (i.e., UC Santa Barbara, UC Santa
Cruz and UC Riverside) have over higher ranked ones (i.e., UC Berkeley and UC San Diego) in
the net returns to graduating less-prepared minority students in the sciences.
The selection-adjusted shares based on a 4-year graduation criteria are displayed in Table 8.
There are several points to make about these estimates. First, as we found when comparing the
actual persistence and graduation rates for minorities across the two graduation criteria (see
Tables 4 and 5), the predicted science persistence and overall graduation rates for minorities are
much lower when one uses a 4-year graduation criteria compared to the 5-year one. Furthermore,
using the 4-year graduation criteria magnifies the comparative advantage that lesser-ranked
campuses have over higher ones in graduating minorities in the sciences that would occur if
minority student preparation and backgrounds were equalized across campuses. As seen in
Table 8, our measure of across-campus heterogeneity increases with such equalization among
students who initially select a STEM major for all but those in the top SAT quartile. While
somewhat weaker, the same increase in across-campus differentiation would occur in the the nonSTEM fields with such equalization. These findings suggest that the comparative advantage of
lower-tiered campuses over higher-ranked ones in the net returns to minorities of persisting in
the sciences is much stronger for “on-time” graduations.
Finally, the consequences of equalizing across-campuses differences in student preparation
and family background within the initial-major–SAT-quartile cells for non-minorities are displayed in Tables 15 and 16 for 5- and 4-year graduation outcomes, respectively. While the
differences between the selected adjusted and unadjusted shares are qualitatively similar to
those for minorities, the increase in heterogeneity is only found in the bottom quartile. The
cross-race differences reflect in part the large differences between minorities and non-minorities
across other dimensions besides SAT, such as parental income and education, and differences

Gains from Re-Allocating Students to Counterfactual Campuses

The across-campus differences in persistence and graduation rates in the sciences for minorities and non-minorities when academic preparation and family backgrounds are equalized
suggest that there may be gains from re-allocating students across campuses, especially lessprepared ones and ones from less-advantaged backgrounds. In this section we use the estimates
from our model to assess these potential gains. In particular, we estimate the proportion of
students enrolled at a particular campus who would have a higher probability of (i) persisting
and graduating in the sciences, (ii) persisting and graduating in the non-sciences, and (iii) graduating with any major at each of the other UC campuses. Unlike in the previous section, in this
exercise the characteristics of students are not equalized at all campuses but are fixed according
to the campus the students actually attended.23
Table 9 displays the proportion of non-minority students that are enrolled at campus A
(“Actual Campus”) who would be predicted to have higher persistence rates if they had enrolled
at each other UC campus (“Counterfactual Campus”) for each of the graduation outcomes noted
above. Consider the gains from these counterfactual reallocations for graduating with a science
degree, conditional on science being a student’s initial major. A number of patterns stand out
for non-minority students. First, with respect to persisting in the sciences, UC San Diego is
very strong. Among initial science majors who attended one of the top five UC campuses,
virtually all of them would have higher net returns to graduating in the sciences if they were
enrolled at UC San Diego, and a majority of students enrolled at the bottom three UC campuses
would have higher net returns in the sciences at UC San Diego. Second, UC Davis and UC
Riverside appear to have strong relative advantages for graduating students from top-five and
bottom-three UC campuses, respectively, in the sciences. For example, science students at UC
Berkeley or UCLA would have higher persistence rates in the sciences at UC Davis, less than
23

We note that this case is almost equivalent to graduating in the non-sciences conditional on not beginning
in the sciences as we have seen that switch rates from non-science majors to science majors are rare.

Table 8: Selection-Adjusted Shares of Minority Students Graduating in 4 Years with Science or Non-Science
Majors, by Campus, SAT Quartile, and Initial Major

a third of the science students at UC Santa Barbara, or UC Riverside would be better off at
Davis. Third, aside from these three “science” schools, re-allocating science students from the
campus they enrolled at to the other campuses tends to produce improvements persistence rates
in the sciences for less than half of the non-minority students. In short, among non-minorities,
students in the sciences appear to be relatively well-matched to campuses, although there would
be gains if more of them had gone, or could have gone, gone to UC San Diego.
The pattern for the gains from these hypothetical re-allocations of non-minority students
across the UC campuses with respect to graduation outside of the sciences are quite different
from the persistence-in-the-sciences outcome. Our estimates imply that most non-minority
students at a particular UC campus (e.g., UC Berkeley) would not gain from moving to lesserranked one. (Note the greater proportions of gainers above the diagonal in the bottom two
panels of Table 9 compared to those below the diagonal.) This pattern is especially true for
students who start out in the non-sciences, where almost every non-minority student enrolled at
a campus other than UC Berkeley would gain in terms of graduation if they were allowed to go to
UC Berkeley. Thus, while which campus one is matched to appears to be particularly important
for the persistence in the sciences, being allocated to a more-selective campus improves overall
graduation rates, especially for non-minority students who start out in the non-sciences.
The corresponding results for minority students are presented in Table 10. They are very
different from those for non-minorities. First, almost all minorities that were enrolled at a UC
campus would have higher persistence rates in the sciences if they we reallocated to a lesserranked campus. (The percentages above the diagonal in the first panel of Table 10 are generally
close to 100% and are much larger than those below the diagonal.) The one exception is again
UC San Diego where relatively strong minority students would have higher persistence rates in
the sciences. This stronger pattern of the relative advantage in persistence in the sciences for
minorities at lower-ranked campuses results in large part from the large differences in academic
preparation between the minorities and non-minorities.
Turning to the gains from re-allocating students in the bottom two panels of Table 10, one
continues to see high proportions of minorities gaining from the hypothetical moves to lowerranked campuses, though there are exceptions. Namely, over half of minority students at UC

Berkeley would see decreases in their overall graduation rates if they moved to any of the lowerranked campuses with the exception of UC Irvine. Further, while UC San Diego and UC Davis
do well in the sciences, their overall graduation rates tend to be lower. Besides these exceptions,
the general pattern is that moving minorities to less-selective campuses results in increases in
overall graduation rates.
To get a better sense of how the graduation rates of students with differing academic backgrounds would fare by moving to different campuses, Table 11 displays, for the 5-year graduation
criteria, the gains (losses) of moving minority and non-minority students enrolled at the three
highest ranked campuses (UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego) to the two lowest-ranked
ones (UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside). Here, we report results by SAT quartiles in order
to capture, in part, the differences in the academic preparation of (minority and non-minority)
students across the various campuses. We continue to focus on the same graduation outcomes
as we considered in Tables 9 and 10.
The first three panels of Table 11 give the results for non-minority students enrolled at UC
Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego. Non-minority students in the bottom quartile of the SAT
distribution at UC Berkeley or UCLA would see a higher probability of graduating the sciences
had they instead attended UC Santa Cruz or UC Riverside. Recall that not many non-minority
students are in the bottom quartile of the total SAT score distribution at these campuses (see
Table 3). As we move to higher SAT quartiles, the comparative advantage of lower-ranked
campuses in graduating non-minority students in the sciences diminishes and then flips, i.e.,
moving non-minority students in higher SAT quartiles to the lower-ranked campuses would
result in losses, not gains, in persistence rates in the sciences. As noted above, non-minority
students at UC San Diego were more likely to persist and graduate in the sciences, on average,
than if they moved to any other UC campus. We see from Table 11 this holds within each SAT
quartile, at least when UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside are the counterfactual campuses. And,
consistent with our more aggregated results in Table 16, non-minority students enrolled at UC
Berkeley, UCLA or UC San Diego for each SAT quartile would be less likely to graduate overall
if they were switched to either of the lower-ranked campuses, regardless of their initial major.
The gains and losses of moving minority students from top- to lower-ranked campuses are

found in the bottom three panels of Table 11. As before, the patterns for gains and losses for
minority students differ from those for non-minorities, but now we see how they differ by a
major of academic preparation. With the exception of switching students from UC San Diego
to UC Santa Cruz, minority students in the bottom two SAT quartiles who attended one of
the top three campuses would have higher persistence rates in the sciences had they instead
attended either lower-ranked campus. Recall from Table 3 that the share of minority students
in these bottom two quartiles range from a low of 66.8% (= 34.5% + 32.3%) at UC Berkeley
to a high of 77.5% (= 37.1% + 40.4%) UCLA for the top three campuses. UC Riverside seems
especially good at graduating minority students in the sciences as minority students from each
quartile that were enrolled at any of the top three campuses would have higher net returns to
graduating in the sciences if they had enrolled at UC Riverside. In contrast, UC Santa Cruz
tends to be better at graduating students overall. Finally, we note that the apparent gains
of re-allocating minority students are lower in terms of graduating with any major than they
are for graduating in the sciences, again stressing that the match between the school and the
student is especially important in the sciences.
This potential for sizeable gains in minorities graduating with science degrees by re-allocating
less-prepared students from higher- to lower-ranked campuses raises the obvious question of why
these gains are not being realized. That is why are minority students beginning in sciences at
selective colleges when their chances of graduating in the sciences would be higher elsewhere?
There are at least two potential answers to this questions. First, students may not be maximizing
their probabilities of graduating in the sciences when deciding where to enroll. Our results show
that while many minority students would see their science graduation probabilities significantly
rise by attending a less-selective school, the rise in their overall graduation probability would
be much smaller.24 Second, students may be ill-informed about their success probabilities in
various fields. Arcidiacono, Aucejo, Fang, and Spenner (2012) show that affirmative action can
result in welfare losses for minority students if universities have private information about how
well the student will perform at their school. Both Bettinger et al. (2009) and Hoxby and Avery
24

Arcidiacono, Aucejo, Coate and Hotz (2012) examine UC graduation rates before and after Proposition 209,
which banned the use of racial preferences in admission. They find that better matching of minority students to
schools as a result of Proposition 209 and that it had a positive effect on minority graduation rates, regardless
of major, although the effect was small.

Table 11: Estimated Gains (Losses) in 5-Year Graduations Moving from More Selective to Less Selective UC Campuses

(2012) show that information may be a serious concern among low income students.

Conclusion
Our evidence suggests significant heterogeneity in how campuses produce college graduates in

science and non-science fields. The most-selective UC campuses have a comparative advantage
in graduating the most academically-prepared students while less selective campuses have a
comparative advantage in graduating the least academically-prepared students. Further, some
campuses, such as UC San Diego and UC Davis, are particularly good at graduating students
in sciences but perform poorly when looking at overall graduation rates.
We find evidence that the match between the college and the student is particularly important in the sciences. Our evidence suggests that, in a period when racial preferences in
admissions were strong, minority students were in general over-matched, resulting in low graduation rates in the sciences and a decreased probability of graduating in four years. In contrast,
non-minority students are generally well-placed for graduating in the sciences. Policies which
lead to a better match between the student and college – at least when the student is interested
in the sciences – have the potential to mitigate some of the under-representation of minorities
in the sciences.
