ABSTRACT
We develop a structural gravity model that introduces scale effects in bilateral trade. Scale effects
and incomplete passthrough give two channels through which exchange rates have real effects on trade
patterns. Estimates from Canadian provincial trade data identify these effects through their interaction
with the US border. We find statistically and quantitatively significant economies of scale in cross-border
trade in almost 2/3 of sectors. Real effects of exchange rate changes on trade are found for 12 of 19
goods sectors and none of 9 services sectors.

Introduction

This paper develops and estimates a structural gravity model with novel trade scale effects
due to cross-border trade technology with variable returns to scale. Economies of scale are
statistically and economically significant in almost half of sectors analyzed. The second
novelty of the paper is a role for exchange rate movements. Exchange rate movements
might be expected to be absorbed by movement of the multilateral resistance terms of
structural gravity, an expectation confirmed here for the special case of constant returns trade
technology and complete exchange rate passthrough. But non-uniform scale or passthrough
elasticities open channels through which exchange rates have real effects on trade patterns.
The application to the trade of Canada’s provinces identifies these effects through their
interaction with the US border. Exchange rates have economically significant real effects in
most goods trade sectors. In contrast, the hypothesis of no real effects cannot be rejected
for services trade.
Scale effects in cross-border trade are inferred from differences between internal and
external destination trade cost parameters such as the elasticity of trade with respect to
distance. Allowance for scale parameters significantly modifies the usual gravity equation.
Increasing returns to scale (IRS) trade technology is plausibly associated with division of
labor in distribution or with lumpy infrastructure investment at the destination. Decreasing
returns to scale (DRS) is plausibly associated with congestion at border crossing points.
DRS is not found in our data, perhaps because little of Canada-US trade passes through
seaports. Differences in scale parameters across external destinations open the channel for
exchange rate changes to have real effects.
Incomplete passthrough of exchange rates to prices is the second channel through which
exchange rates have real effects. Incomplete passthrough is very well documented, with
passthrough elasticities estimated from internationally comparable price data over relatively
short horizons. This paper seeks to infer a passthrough elasticity from panel trade data
based on a model of incomplete passthrough over a period of two years. Either non-uniform
1

passthrough or non-uniform scale elasticities induces real effects of exchange rates on trade
flows in our version of the structural gravity model.
Structural gravity models in the previous literature have not previously dealt with exchange rate effects because they are (implicitly) absorbed in the importer- and exportertime fixed effects that are required to control for multilateral resistance. As we show, this
is justified because previous literature assumed constant returns trade technology and most
researchers implicitly assumed complete passthrough obtained in the static gravity model
setting. Canadian provincial production and trade panel data afford the opportunity to
identify possible exchange rate real effects via their interaction with the international border, as opposed to being lost in the fixed effects that act on both internal and international
trade. Nevertheless, with uniform passthrough or scale elasticities, our model implies that in
principle all exchange rate changes are absorbed in multilateral resistance, hence in practice
are absorbed by origin and destination region fixed effects.
The model is applied to the bilateral trade of Canada’s provinces with the US in 19 goods
and 9 services sectors over 1997-2007, a decade that features an 11% depreciation followed by
a 45% appreciation of the Canadian/US exchange rate.1 We concentrate on bilateral trade
between US and Canada, ignoring relationships with the Rest of the World (ROW). We
suppress ROW from our analysis for three reasons. First, the trade cost function we develop
below is unlikely to plausibly approximate such a heterogeneous aggregate region. Second,
aggregation may bias our inferences regarding exchange rate and scale effects of trade with
such a large region. Third, introducing ROW data does not have any effect on our model of
biliateral trade or its estimated results due to the separable fixed effects estimation structure
that we use. Thus, we leave a world study for future research.
Significant scale economies in cross-border trade are found for 36 of 56 (64%) of destinationcountry/sectors. To give a simple idea of magnitude, for aggregate goods trade a 100% rise
in imports lowers Canadian trade costs by 10.8% and lowers US trade costs by 5.4%. For
1

In 1997 the exchange rate stood at 0.72, then it fell to 0.64 in 2003, and in 2007 it was at 0.93.

2

aggregate services imports of Canada the corresponding reduction is 8.2% while for the US
the estimated elasticity is not significantly different from 0.
We define money neutrality as equivalent to exchange rate changes having no real effects
on trade. The reduced form elasticity of trade with respect to the exchange rate is not
directionally identified due to multicollinearity (as explained below), so a test of money
neutrality involves both rejecting scale uniformity and uniformity of a combination of other
coefficients. Our results reject money neutrality for 12 of 19 goods sectors and no service
sectors.
Partial identification of the underlying parameters based on the structural model allows
either inference of a common passthrough elasticity and scale parameters for given elasticity
of substitution, or inference of an elasticity of substitution and scale elasticities given assumed passthrough elasticities.2 Inferred trade elasticities for goods accord with estimates
in the related literature. Inferred passthrough elasticities for goods mostly lie within the
unit interval, with an overall average estimate close to 1. We provide evidence consistent
with depreciation passthrough being larger than appreciation passthrough. Our trade elasticity and passthrough estimates for services are far less plausible than for goods because
money neutrality cannot be rejected in the hypothesis test, hence the constructed coefficient
estimators that rely on non-neutrality are only weakly identified.
The modeling innovations of this paper come with several caveats. Both the trade cost
scale elasticity and the passthrough elasticity are black box parameters. The variation of
our results across sectors suggests a big payoff to opening the boxes. For scale elasticities,
the caveat applies especially to a few sectors where the results suggest a mis-specified trade
cost equation. As for exchange rate passthrough elasticities, there is ample evidence that exchange rate passthrough is incomplete over horizons of several years (Goldberg and Knetter,
1997) but it is unlikely to be constant.3 Following much of the literature, we do not model

purposes (Arkolakis et al., 2011).

Goldberg and Knetter conclude that “While the response varies by industry, a price response equal

The real effects of exchange rates identified in this paper have further unmodeled consequences. A full general equilibrium approach to the real effects of exchange rates would
embed the sectoral gravity models of this paper in a general equilibrium superstructure that
accounts for both pricing behavior and the general equilibrium consequences of the changing
trade costs implied by the scale and passthrough effects.
Section 2 sets out the theoretical foundation. Section 3 develops the econometric specification and describes the data. Section 4 presents the main results, quantitative implications,
and robustness checks. Section 5 concludes. Supplemental Appendices A and B respectively
describe the data and provide technical notes.

Theoretical Foundation

We review gravity based on the Armington-CES demand system due to Anderson (1979).5
Then we add a treatment of trade costs with scale effects and incomplete exchange rate
passthrough.
The structural gravity model (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003) specifies that in each
sector k the share of the world’s trade in k that flows form origin i to destination j is given
by
tkij
Πki Pjk

Xijk = Y k ski bkj

!1−σk
,

(1)

where, Xijk is the bilateral shipment, Y k is the world shipment from all origins to all destinations, ski = Yik /Y k is the share of world shipments coming from origin i, bkj = Ejk /Y k is the
for shipments to US” (p.3). We abstract from explaining high frequency trade movements (within a year)
because these reflect random shocks and dynamic adjustment that have yet to be integrated with the gravity
model. Differences in currency invoicing practices and length of contract terms affect high frequency price
responses to exchange rate changes. It is possible that such differences across sectors may induce differing
passthrough rates that persist in the medium run. In that case differing invoicing and contracting practices
may help explain part of the differences in results we report across sectors.
4
A search for evidence of pricing-to-market using our industry level data produced no informative results.
5
Gravity models of trade flows have a variety of consistent theoretical foundations that lead to equivalent
representations at the sectoral level. See Anderson (2011) for details.

share of world shipments going from all origins to destination k, and ski bkj is the predicted
pattern of trade in a frictionless world economy. All shipments are assumed to be valued
at destination prices. The term in brackets gives the effect of frictions that drive trade
away from the predicted frictionless pattern ski bkj . Outward multilateral resistance Πki and
inward multilateral resistance Pjk , are implied by the market clearance and budget constraint
systems that lead to (1):

Gravity equations are typically estimated using origin- and destination-time fixed effects
to control for the shares and the unobserved multilateral resistances. The fixed effects also
control for the sales and expenditure shares ski , bkj . The total shipment Y k is typically not
believably observed, so it is controlled for with a fixed effect (constant term) and gravity is
estimated as
Xijk = cxki mkj (tkij )1−σk + kij

(4)

where c is the constant term controlling for Y k and mean measurement error in the Xij ’s, xi
and mj are exporter and importer fixed effects controlling for ski /(Πki )1−σk and bkj /(Pkk )1−σk ,
respectively, and kij is an error term that we will take to be Poisson below. Because the full
set of importer and exporter fixed effects is perfectly collinear with the constant vector, it is
necessary (and harmless) to omit a base country so that mk0 xk0 for some country 0 is factored
into the constant term c, along with the scaling term Y k and the mean measurement error in
the trade flow data. The estimation of tkij , the bilateral trade friction, is the main object of
empirical gravity, with specification discussed below in Section 2.1 that introduces exchange
rate effects.
The full effect of exchange rate changes alters the multilateral resistances as well as the

5

bilateral trade costs. In a special case set out in the next section these changes completely
offset the bilateral effects, leading to money neutrality.

2.1

Modeling Exchange Rate Effects on Trade

Most previous gravity literature has ignored exchange rates on the assumption that exchange
rates were neutral (money neutrality) in a static trade model setting. Some previous empirical gravity models have inserted real exchange rates into gravity equations without a
theoretical foundation.6 Modern applied gravity models use origin and destination country
fixed effects to control for multilateral resistance, controls which absorb any exchange rate
effects.
Exchange rate changes have effects on trade only if they alter relative prices. In the
gravity model this effectively means altering the cost of international relative to intra-national
trade. Thus exchange rates with real effects are part of the border effect component of
bilateral trade costs. Two potential channels for exchange rate action are developed here.
The price channel directly turns exchange rate changes into relative price changes based
on overwhelming evidence from a large empirical literature (e.g. Goldberg and Knetter,
1997) showing that internal prices move less than external ones in response to exchange rate
changes. Comparing prices of identical traded goods, the literature establishes that exchange
rate passthrough is less than complete. The second, scale channel passes exchange rate (or
other cost) changes to cross-border trade volume changes to changes in international relative
to intra-national trade cost.
Trade cost factor (tkij )1−σk is typically specified to be a loglinear function of bilateral
variables such as distance, contiguity and the presence or absence of a border between the
buyer and seller. The theoretical and empirical innovation to tkij developed here adds log6

The standard practice in these studies is to include a real exchange rate variable in a traditional version
of the empirical gravity model, with no country-time fixed effects to control for multilateral resistance and
with country mass variables represented by GDP and population. See for example Griffoli (2006), Kim et al.
(2003), and Martı̀nez-Zarzoso and Felicitas Nowak-Lehmann (2003). A prominent but tangentially related
literature considers the effect of exchange rate regimes such as currency unions on bilateral trade patterns.
See Baldwin (2006) for a review of the literature on the effects of exchange rate regimes.

linear volume and exchange rate passthrough terms.
Analyzing exchange rate passthrough channel first, the implied relative price change
reflects the standard intuition that appreciation of the exchange rate acts like a tax on
imports and a subsidy on exports, both relative to domestic transactions. The portion of the
appreciation of the currency that is passed through is modeled with parametric passthrough
elasticity ρj for some generic good from region i sold to region j.7 The direct effect on
expenditures in j on goods from i in the CES system is given by the exchange rate component
of bilateral trade costs (ri /rj )(1−σ)ρj , where ri is the appreciation factor of the currency for
region i with respect to some base period and similarly for rj . Then ri /rj is the appreciation
of the bilateral exchange rate of i with j, (ri /rj )ρj is the passthrough to price paid by j,
and is recognized as a component of bilateral trade cost tkij when i and j are separated by a
border.
As for multilateral resistance being affected by (ri /rj )(1−σ)ρj , all the steps leading to (1)(3) continue to be valid even when exchange rates have real effects on total shipments Yik
and total expenditures Ejk as well as on multilateral resistances due to system (2)-(3). All
such effects are subsumed into the origin and destination country fixed effects that vary with
time in the best practice estimation. Exchange rates have real effects in the gravity model
only through shifting bilateral trade costs tkij asymmetrically.8
The scale channel is due to the trade cost effect of changing international trade volume.
Volume shipped from i to j is Vij . We assume that for each bilateral link that crosses a
border (denoted by an indicator variable Bij = 1 when i and j are in separate countries and
Bij = 0 elsewhere) there are volume effects with elasticity φij = φj Bij such that the per unit
7

This constant elasticity form is standard in empirical trade analysis; see Feenstra (2004), Chapter 7 for
example. We can allow for different elasticity parameters in different regions and at different times, but
always as exogenous parameters.
8
It is possible to account for the full general equilibrium indirect effects of exchange rate changes by
embedding (2)-(3) in a general equilibrium superstructure that also determines the effects of exchange rate
changes on {Yik , Ejk }. A full account is unnecessary for the purposes of this paper.

where τij is the standard bilateral iceberg trade cost factor, a (loglinear) function of the
standard set of trade cost gravity variables (see below). The usual constant trade costs case
is φj = 0, the boundary scale parameter between DRS (IRS) with elasticity φj > (<)0. It is
important in thinking about trade costs to note that tij includes all costs between the factory
gate and the end user, usually including costs directly incurred by the end user. Thus the
scale effects pertain to both seller and buyer in principle. Specification (5) associates scale
effects with the border crossing into the destination, plausibly linked to customs control.9
The simple model (5) can be elaborated in various ways to fit better and to accommodate
special characteristics of sectors, but for our present purposes of comparison across sectors
it is advantageous to apply this model everywhere.
Volume is given by Vij = Xij /(τij ri /rj ) where the deflator tij ri /rj removes both the effect
of exchange rate appreciation (that raises ‘factory gate’ prices pi in terms of the numeraire
currency used to convert trade flows to common value units) and the ‘volume’ used up in
trade costs, thus specifying in (5) that trade cost is a function of volume delivered.10 Use
this deflation and the deterministic portion of the right hand side of (4) for Xij and combine
with (5) to solve for volume as a reduced form function of the exogenous variables:

1/(1+σφij )
Vij = xi mj τij−σ (ri /rj )−1−ρj σ
.

(6)

The constant elasticity specification is an important simplification allowing a simple reduced
form solution.11
9

The scale setup is robust to at least modest generalization of the bilateral volume effect modeled here,
though it fits with the focus on Canadian trade with US. A plausible alternative is multilateral volume effects
on trade costs. The technical appendix (Appendix B) available on request shows that this case retains the
key properties from the bilateral model.
10
Specifying (5) with volume defined at the origin, Xij /(ri /rj ), differs unessentially for purposes below.
Also, switching from assuming value is measured in the data based on origin currency prices to measurement
based on destination currency prices makes no essential difference; the deflation is by (ri /rj )ρj .
11
The DRS case with parametric φj > 0 can be derived as a good approximation to an underlying constant

8

Substituting (6) into (5) and simplifying,12 the reduced-form bilateral trade cost function
is

1/(1+σφij )
tij = τij (xi mj )φij (ri /rj )ρj −φij
, ∀i, j.

(7)

Exchange rate movements ri /rj have effects potentially only on international trade costs in
(7); domestic trade costs are insulated by ri /ri ≡ 1. In the empirical analysis, the real effects
of exchange rate movements are identified at the border where ri 6= rj in contrast to internal
and interprovincial trade. The remainder of the (7) differs from the usual gravity specification
in that (i) τij is modified by being raised to a destination-specific power 1/(1 + σφij ) and (ii)
there is a cost-changing scale term (xi mj )φij /(1+σφij ) . The stability condition for the plausible
quantity-adjustment mechanism in the ‘trade market’ is 1 + σφij > 0, i.e. IRS cannot be too
strong. (Appendix B available on request presents the argument.)
The model is completed by substituting the reduced form trade cost function (7) into the
deterministic part of the structural gravity equation (4)
(1−σ)/(1+σφij )

Xij,t = c(1+φij )/(1+σφij ) (xi,t mj,t )(1+φij )/(1+σφij ) τij

(ri,t /rj,t )(ρj −φij )(1−σ)/(1+σφij ) . (8)

The determinants of τij comprise the usual list of geographic variables including a pure border
effect, each entering (8) with a coefficient to be inferred that combines with the exponent of
τij , (1 − σ)/(1 + σφij ). The rightmost term in (8) is the exchange rate effect.
Equation (8) is the key mechanism explaining the link of exchange rates to trade in our
paper. For ρj − φj ≥ 0, appreciation of the bilateral exchange rate increases trade costs
tij and thus decreases the value of trade at delivered (user) prices Xij or at origin (‘factory
gate’) prices Xij /tij . In contrast, for ρj − φj < 0 appreciation decreases trade costs and thus
returns Cobb-Douglas technology with fixed capacity. Different elasticities could reflect different physical or
regulatory environments in which the trade technology must operate. If capacity is adjustable in the short
run, the model reverts to the standard case where the cost of entering j’s market is uniform and subsumed
into Pj , empirically controlled for with importer fixed effects.

increases the value of trade at delivered prices Xij or at origin prices Xij /tij . The intuition is
that less of the iceberg melts: volume going through shipment falls by (6) and with ρj < φj
the net effect is a reduction in loss due to shipping costs, resulting in a gain in both factory
gate priced exports and user priced exports.13
The general effect of increasing returns to scale (IRS) is to amplify the effect of exchange
rate depreciation on exports because the increase in trade volume induces a further fall
in trade costs. A interesting implication of (8) is that strong IRS may result in more than
complete effective passthrough ρj − φj > 1. Similarly, the general effect of decreasing returns
to scale (DRS) is to dampen the effect of exchange rate appreciation on exports because the
decline in trade volume induces a compensating fall in trade costs. A novel and surprising
implication of (8) is that with strong enough DRS (large φj ), the fall in trade costs can more
than compensate for the appreciation of exchange rates, ρj − φj < 0. For different goods and
services the sign of ρj − φj can differ, reflecting small or large congestion elasticity (φj > 0
relative to the passthrough elasticity ρj , or a switch from DRS (φj > 0) to scale economies
IRS (φj < 0).
This paper takes exchange-rate-passthrough induced changes in relative prices as exogenous, hence no reverse causality flows from trade to exchange rates. Exogeneity is a defensible
assumption for sectoral bilateral trade flows in goods and services, where the bilateral trade
in any sector has negligible impact on the aggregate current account and hence on exchange
rates. Sensitivity experiments confirm the robustness of our main findings to endogeneity
concerns. The experiments use lagged exchange rates and alternatively employ the average
treatment effect methodology from Baier and Bergstrand (2007), who use it to successfully
address trade policy endogeneity.14
13

Whether the reduction in tij is a global efficiency gain or not depends on specifying what the trade cost
represents. If there is s a change in dead weight loss associated with the change in tij , then a fall is an
efficiency gain. For example, unpriced congestion results in inefficiently long delays because at the margin
the shippers do not internalize the added delays they impose on others; hence an appreciation with ρj < φj
reduces the inefficiency.
14
The monopolistic competition literature suggests endogenous exchange rate passthrough due to Pricing
to Market (PTM) by firms that rationally price discriminate. We do not address PTM in this paper based
on industry level data. We failed to find meaningful evidence of PTM when using industry data along with

Econometric Specification

An important simplification preserves degrees of freedom. Let R = {CA, U S} denote the
destination country. Impose common scale and passthrough parameters across all Canadian
destination provinces: φij = φiR = φR Bij .15 The structural ER gravity specification for
international trade becomes:
(1−σ)/(1+σφR )

Xij,t = c(1+φR )/(1+σφR ) (xi,t mj,t )(1+φR )/(1+σφR ) τij

(ri,t /rj,t )(ρR −φR )(1−σ)/(1+σφR ) .

It is convenient to rewrite this restriction of (8) as

(ln xi,t + ln mj,t ) +

ln(ri,t /rj,t )
1 + σφR
1 + σφR
1 + σφR
(9)

where kR = (1 + φR )/(1 + σφR ) ln c. For inter-provincial and internal trade of Canada and
for internal trade of the US, the term φR disappears from (9) because the international trade
indicator variable Bij = 0. In subsequent steps below, switching off φR for internal and
interprovincial trade is taken as implicit.
The right hand side of (9) comprises three parts: the fixed effects part (including the
constant), the trade costs part exclusive of exchange rate effects and the exchange rate part.
We develop the fixed effects part first, then the trade costs part and finally the exchange
rate effects part.

Fixed Effects Specification

The fixed effects terms in (9) is

effects term (in logs) is approximated by expanding a Taylor’s Series about φR = 0 and
strong symmetry assumptions about the unobserved distribution of firms. Essentially this is because the
elasticity of the markup with respect to exchange rate variation is very small for finite but plausible firm
share size. Appendix B is available on request for more discussion.

For the US as a destination there is no state variation because our services data is available only for
aggregate US origin and destination, and we impose the same aggregation on the goods data for comparability.

φR )/(1 + σφR ) with ln xi,t + ln x̄[(1 − σ)φR )/(1 + σφR )], where ln x̄ = i,t xi,t /N T where N
is the number of regions and T is the number of time periods.16 The second term in the
expansion is an international border effect.17 Adding together the analogous expression for
inward trade, the specification of the fixed effects is simplified to:
1 + φR
(ln xi,t + ln mj,t ) = ηi,t + θj,t + βbrdr U SA CAN .
1 + σφR

(10)

Here, ηi,t and θj,t are time-varying exporter and importer fixed effects, respectively. U SA CAN
is a dummy variable equal to one for US exports to Canada. Evidently, βbrdr = βusa,can +
βcan,usa , where βusa,can and βcan,usa are the directional border estimates for US exports to
Canada and for US imports from Canada, respectively. Finally, we note that the origin and
destination fixed effects in (10) will absorb completely the destination-specific constant term
kR in specification (9).

3.2

Trade Cost Specification

As a first step we proxy τij with bilateral distance, contiguity and borders. The trade costs

The approximation is a first order Taylor’s series,

1 + φR
ln xi,t ≈ ln x̄ + [ln xi,t − ln x̄] + ln x̄[(1 + φR )(1 + σφR ) − 1] = ln xi + ln x̄(1 − σ)φR /(1 + σφR ).
1 + σφR
17
The expansion is simplified to time invariance by imposing a single mean ln x̄. In principle this can be
relaxed to allow time varying means, ln x̄t .

12

Here, DISTij is the logarithm of bilateral distance between trading partners i and j, including internal distance in i.18 CON T IGij takes a value of one when a Canadian province
neighbors a US state, and is set to zero otherwise. The contiguity variable is widely used in
the literature on Canadian trade with the US. The motivation is that, all else equal, contiguous provinces and states would trade more with each other. The next three covariates
in (11), IN T ERN AL, IN T ERN AT ION AL CA U S and IN T ERN AT ION AL U S CA,
capture the effects of borders relative to interprovincial trade. Here, IN T ERN AL is a
dummy variable that is equal to one for internal trade within any region, i.e. a province or
a territory and US. IN T ERN AT ION AL CA U S is equal to one for Canadian exports to
US and IN T ERN AT ION AL U S CA is equal to one for US exports to Canada, allowing
for asymmetric border effects between the two countries. Importantly, all border variables
in (11) will be absorbed in the specification of the fixed-effects interaction terms above. The
remaining trade cost terms from specification (11) yield:

where for internal and interprovincial trade φR = 0 and for international trade φR = φR , R =

Expression (12) captures three important implications of our theory that deviate from
standard gravity treatments. First, owing to destination-specific trade-volume effects (i.e.
φcan 6= φusa ), the effects of international distance could differ across importers. Therefore,
we split the international distance variable into its directional components DIST CAN and
DIST U SA. Second, due to the fact that trade-volume effects are assumed not to obtain
internally, the effects of internal distance within each region, IN T ERN AL DIST , should be
different from the effects of international distance.19 Third, we offer an additional structural
motivation for the magnitudes and for the asymmetries in the effects of contiguity between
18

The measure of this variable is from Anderson and Yotov (2010), who follow Mayer and Zignago (2006)
to obtain population-weighted bilateral distances for Canada’s trade. This procedure is consistent with
respect to calculating both internal and bilateral distances.
19
This lends support to the empirical findings from Anderson and Yotov (2012) who estimate different
effects on internal and on international distance at the sectoral level for goods trade in the world.

Canadian provinces and US states. Following the existing literature, we allow for asymmetric
contiguity effects by splitting CON T IG in two directional components CON T IG P R ST ,
for provincial exports, and CON T IG ST P R, for provincial imports. In addition, our theory
implies that trade-volume effects can strengthen or weaken the effects of contiguity and can
make the symmetries in these effects more or less pronounced. With these considerations in
mind expression (12) for the effect of trade costs apart from pure border effects and exchange

Exchange Rate Effects Specification

Finally, we turn to modeling the exchange rate effect on log trade,

(ρR −φR )(1−σ)
1+σφR

ln(ri,t /rj,t ).

Given the regions in our sample, we define:
(ρR − φR )(1 − σ)
ln(ri,t /rj,t )

(ρusa − φusa )(1 − σ)
(ρcan − φcan )(1 − σ)
CAN U SA × rcan,t −
U SA CAN × rcan,t .
1 + σφusa
1 + σφcan
(14)

Here, rcan,t is defined as Canadian dollars per US dollar at time t relative to the same
ratio in the base year, 1997. Thus, a fall (an increase) in rcan,t depicts an appreciation (a
depreciation) of the Canadian dollar. This implies

(ρusa −φusa )(1−σ)

> 0, i.e. a depreciation of

the Canadian dollar should lead to increase in Canadian exports to US. Similarly, we would

with a fall in Canadian imports from US. CAN U SA and U SA CAN are indicator variables
for Canadian exports (to US) and for Canadian imports (from US), respectively.
The interactive fixed effect structure of (14) implies that the estimates of the exchange
rate effects in each direction are deviations from the corresponding directional border estimates for CA-US trade. To describe the relationship in terms of estimated coefficients,

14

rewrite (14) as:

Due to perfect collinearity between the two exchange rate terms in (15) and the timevarying directional fixed effects in (10), we cannot separately identify the two ER effects
when using the full set of origin and destination fixed effect (less one due to keeping the
constant term). Instead of dropping another origin-destination fixed effect, we choose to
drop the ER term for Canadian imports from the US. The interpretation of the fixed effects
is that the dropped term is subtracted from the ‘true’ fixed effect, and the estimate of the
ER effect on Canadian exports to the US includes the ER term for Canadian imports. (15)
as it is estimated becomes:
(ρR − φR )(1 − σ)
ln(ri,t /rj,t ) = βer ER CA EXP ,

Substitute (10), (13) and (16) into the deterministic gravity equation (9), to obtain the

To build intuition and trust in the structural use of collinearity in (17), in the empirical analysis (see
Table 2) we show that estimating the two coefficients βer exp and βer imp through the expedient of dropping
another origin country or province fixed effect yields a sum equal to the estimate of βer as described above.
The same alternative regression demonstrates that βbrdr = βus,ca + βca,us .

capture the effects of distance

on trade. We expect the estimates of these coefficients to be negative and the estimate
of the effect of internal distance, α1 , to be smaller in absolute value than the effects of
international distance, α2 and α3 . α4 =

γ2 (1−σ)
(1+σφusa )

and α5 =

γ3 (1−σ)
(1+σφcan )

capture the effects of

contiguity between a province and a state. We expect the estimates of these coefficients to
be positive and we can test whether scale effects contribute to directional asymmetries, if
any.
A statistically significant difference in the magnitudes of the estimates of α2 and α3
rejects the hypothesis of scale neutrality, a component of money neutrality. The model also
implies a direct test of whether exchange rates are neutral on not. Rearranging (17) and
using βbrdr = βusa,can + βcan,usa

βer + βbrdr =

(ρusa − φusa )(1 − σ) (ρcan − φcan )(1 − σ)

The hypothesis of net money neutrality is rejected when the estimated β̂er + β̂brdr differs
significantly from zero. If the scale neutrality hypothesis α̂3 − α̂2 = 0 is also rejected then
the implication of the preceding equation is that passthrough uniformity cannot be rejected.
In this case full money neutrality cannot be rejected because the right hand side is equal to
zero if ρusa = ρcan and φusa = φcan , which the theory shows implies money neutrality.
Money neutrality in the sense of this paper applies to distribution of goods within a
sector — exchange rates have no real effects on the pattern of trade within sectors. Full
general equilibrium neutrality requires that all sectors have money neutrality in this sense.
16

Departures from neutrality in any sector imply relative price changes between sectors that
shift sales and expenditure shares. These real effects on the economy are controlled for in
the sectoral gravity equations with origin and destination time fixed effects.

Data

A notable feature of this project is that we compile a comprehensive data set that covers most
of Canada’s economy at the sectoral level for a total of 28 industries including agriculture,
fuels, 17 manufacturing sectors, and 9 service categories for the period 1997-2007.21 The
choice of the 1997-2007 period is due to coverage limitations of our services data set. In
order to estimate gravity, we use industry-level data on bilateral trade flows and output for
each trading partner (including all Canadian provinces and territories and US), all measured
in current (’00,000) Canadian dollars, as well as other variables which we describe below.
Trade flows data. Statistics Canada’s Table 386-0002 is the original data source for intraprovincial and interprovincial trade flows for both goods and services.22 Data on shipments
between Canadian provinces and the United States are from the Trade Data Online web
interface of Industry Canada, which provides access to Canadian and US trade data by
21

The sector selection was based on (but is not completely identical to) the S-level of aggregation as
classified in the Statistics Canada’s Hierarchical Structure of the I-O Commodity Classification (Revised:
November 3, 2010). The 28 sector categories include (Abbreviated labeling in parentheses): Agriculture
(AGRIC); Mineral Fuels (FUELS); Food (FOOD); Leather, Rubber and Plastic Products (LETHR); Textile
Products (TXTLE); Hosiery, Clothing and Accessories (APPRL); Lumber and Wood Products (WOOD);
Furniture, Mattresses and Lamps (FRNTR); Wood Pulp, Paper and Paper Products (PAPER); Printing
and Publishing (PRNTG); Primary Metal Products (METL1); Fabricated Metal Products (METL2); Machinery (MCHNS); Motor Vehicles, Transportation Equipment and Parts (VHCLS); Electrical, Electronic,
and Communications Products (ELCTR); Non-metallic Mineral Products (MNRLS); Petroleum and Coal
Products (PETRL); Chemicals, Pharmaceutical, and Chemical Products (CHMCL); Miscellaneous Manufactured Products (MISCL); Transportation and Storage Services, including transportation margins (TRNSP);
Communication Services (CMNCN); Wholesale Services, including Wholesale Margins (WHLSL); Finance,
Insurance and Real Estate services (FNNCE); Professional, Scientific, Technical, Computer, Administrative,
Support, and Related Services (BUSNS); Education Services (EDCTN); Health Care and Social Assistance
Services (HELTH); Accommodation Services and Meals (ACMDN); and, Miscellaneous Services (OTHER).
Finally, we sometimes aggregate all goods (GOODS) and all services (SRVCS). The few commodities missing
from the complete S-level I-O Commodity Classification spectrum are Forestry Products, Fish, Metal Ores,
and Tobacco and Beverages. Reliable bilateral trade data ware not available for those products. Detailed
description of each of the sector categories in our sample are presented in Appendix A.

The actual services data used here (including trade, output and expenditures) is from Anderson et al.
(2011). Please see their data section and data appendix for further details.

product classified according to NAICS; the NAICS sectors were then matched or aggregated
to the S-level. Internal trade for US are obtained as the difference between output and total
exports.
Output data. Provincial output, defined here as the value of production plus shipments
out of the inventories of producers, wholesalers and retailers is from Statistics Canada’s
Table 386-0002. All zero values and blank cells in the output data are treated as missing
information and interpolated accordingly. Output data for the United States come from
several sources. Manufacturing data are from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics database,
which reports industry-level output data at the 3- and 4-digit level of ISIC code. Output for
Agriculture and Mineral Fuels, 1997-2003, is from Anderson and Yotov (2012). The original
sources of these data are the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAOSTAT)
web page, which provides data on agricultural output, and the Energy Information Administration, which provides official energy statistics on the value of fuel production (including
oil, natural gas, and coal). Finally, services output data are from Anderson et al. (2011).
The US Bureau of Economic Analysis is the original source for US service production data.
Other variables. We use the bilateral distances data from Anderson and Yotov (2010),
who follow Mayer and Zignago (2006) to obtain population-weighted bilateral distances. This
procedure is consistent with respect to calculating both internal and bilateral distances. See
Anderson and Yotov (2010) for more details. Exchange rates data are from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Saint Louis’ web site at http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/categories/15.
Finally, we construct a series of border and regional dummy variables, which are described
in the text.

Estimation Results and Analysis

We estimate (18) with the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimator. SantosSilva and Tenreyro (2006) propose PPML to simultaneously address the prominent presence

18

of zeroes and of heteroskedasticity in bilateral trade flows data. We use 2-year lags rather
than a simple panel because Cheng and Wall (2005) note that “[f]ixed-effects estimations are
sometimes criticized when applied to data pooled over consecutive years on the grounds that
dependent and independent variables cannot fully adjust in a single year’s time.”(p.8).23
Tables 1a-1c report results from estimating (18) for each sector in the Canadian economy.
The first column of Table 1a presents estimates for all goods and the remaining columns of
Tables 1a and 1b present estimates for 19 goods sectors. Similarly, the first column of Table
1c presents aggregate estimation results for all service sectors, and the remaining columns in
the table report estimates for 9 service sectors. Table 2 reports results of dropping alternative
dummy variables from the overall goods trade regression of Table 1a. The results illustrate
the collinearity structure of the data that is used to interpret results. Coefficient estimates
from Tables 1a-1c are used with theoretically based identifying restrictions to recover scale
parameters and to infer substitution and passthrough elasticities. Results are reported in
Tables 3a-3c. Finally, sensitivity experiments are offered in Table 4.

4.1

Gravity Estimates

Overall, the PPML estimates from Tables 1a-1c give the usual good fit of gravity for both
disaggregated goods and services. The coefficient estimates of each of the gravity covariates
are discussed in the order in which they appear in econometric specification (18).
Internal Distance. Distance is a significant impediment to internal trade, just as it is
for international trade. All the estimates of the effects of internal distance on trade are
statistically significant at any level and for each sector in our sample.
Variation of the effects of internal distance over sectors is mostly intuitive. For example,
the largest estimates among the goods sectors are for Agriculture, Printing and Minerals,
while the largest estimates among the services categories are for Health services and Other
services, which includes the subcategories of beauty and personal care, funeral, child care,
23

Olivero and Yotov (2012) confirm the relevance of this issue by experimenting with various lags in a
dynamic gravity setup.

household, automobile repairs to recreation, all strongly locally biased because of their personalized nature. Comparison between the aggregate distance elasticities for goods (see
column 1 of Table 1a) and for services (see column 1 of Table 1c) reveals that the latter are,
on average, larger in magnitude: services are on average more localized. Finally, we note
that our estimates of the effects of internal distance are not sensitive to the exclusion of US,
as the single largest region in the sample.
International Distance. Most of the estimates on the international distance variables are
significant at any level of statistical significance. Notable exceptions, where the estimates of
the effects of international distance are not statistically significant, are some resource sectors
such as Fuels, Petroleum and Coal Products and Wood Products.
More novel and important, we find significant asymmetries in the effects of international
distance between Canada’s exports and Canada’s imports. Our estimates suggest that distance is a larger impediment to trade for Canadian imports of both goods and services.
See Panels B of Tables 1a-1c , where we obtain statistically significant differences between
the effects of distance on Canadian imports and exports for fourteen of the nineteen goods
sectors in our sample and for seven of the nine services sectors.
These findings lend support to our theoretical predictions for destination-specific distance effects. Specifically, based on the structural definitions of the distance coefficients
(α1 = γ1 (1 − σ), α2 =

γ1 (1−σ)
,
(1+σφcan )

α3 =

γ1 (1−σ)
),
(1+σφusa )

the estimates on DIST CAN and

DIST U SA suggest an IRS relationship between trade volume and trade costs (φR < 0,
R ∈ {CA, U SA}), which is more pronounced for Canada’s imports, φcan < φusa . See Tables
3a-3c below for details.
This implication should be treated cautiously, because it is sensitive to imprecisely estimated distance elasticities from Canada’s provinces to the single US market in contrast to
the more precisely estimated distance elasticities for Canada’s imports. The greater imprecision for the US destination is due to less variation in the bilateral distance data. Service
trade data limitations required aggregating trade to the US destination. As a result, only 3

20

of 9 service sectors and 12 of 19 goods sectors have significant distance elasticities for export
to the US. The only two sectors for which we obtain negative and significant estimates on
DIST U SA are Transportation and Accommodation.24 Aggregation bias is not a glaring
issue because all bilateral distance variables are consistently aggregated by construction as
population weighted aggregates of city-pair distances.
Panels B of Tables 1a-1c also report statistically significant differences between the effects
of internal and international distance, α1 − α2 and α1 − α3 . We obtain statistically and
economically smaller effects of internal distance as compared to the effects of distance on
Canadian imports, α1 − α2 , for fifteen of the nineteen goods sectors and for eight of the nine
services categories. The findings from comparing the effects of internal distance and the
effects of distance on Canadian exports to US are mixed. We find that the effects of internal
distance are smaller for eight of the nineteen goods sectors and for none of the nine services
sectors. We also estimate smaller effects of distance on CA exports for four goods and four
services sectors. Usually, these results are driven by an insignificant estimate of the effects
of distance on CA exports to US.
The much smaller (in absolute value) estimates on internal distance in most cases suggest
that the scale effects introduced in Section 2 are indeed operational. The results suggest an
IRS relationship (φR < 0, R ∈ {CA, U SA}) between trade volume and trade costs, confirmed
in Tables 3a-3c discussed in Section 4.2 below. Notable exceptions are Fuels, Petroleum
and Coal Products and Wood Products, where the estimates of the effects of international
distance are not only smaller in magnitude but also not statistically significant. The specific
modes of transportation in these sectors in cases where pipelines are used may be a natural
explanation, but the finding also suggests that the cost function is too crude to accurately
represent the reality.
24

The estimate on DIST U SA for Health services is positive and statistically significant, while the corresponding estimate in the opposite direction (on DIST CAN for Health) is the largest of all negative
distance estimates. Both findings indicate that the trade cost function for Health is mis-specified, especially
the positive distance elasticity that violates the stability condition. For purposes of this study it is useful
to maintain a single specification of the trade cost function but a serious treatment of gravity for health
services trade should alter the specification.

21

Contiguity. Most of the contiguity estimates from Tables 1a-1c are positive and statistically significant in each direction of Canadian trade. We also find evidence for directional
asymmetries in the effects of contiguity. In the case of goods trade, contiguity raises Canada’s
imports but not its exports on average, evidenced by the aggregate goods estimates from
column (1) of Table 1a. There is a large, positive and statistically significant estimate
on CON T IG ST P R, capturing contiguity effects on Canada’s imports, but a statistically
insignificant estimate on CON T IG P R ST for contiguity effects on Canada’s exports. Exactly the opposite is true for services trade, where we obtain a positive and statistically
significant estimate on CON T IG P R ST for Canadian services exports but an insignificant
estimate on CON T IG ST P R. See column (1) of Table 1c. In the next section, we analyze
the contribution of trade-volume effects for the magnitudes of the contiguity estimates and
for the directional asymmetries between them.
International Borders. The novelty of generalizing the trade cost function to have distance and contiguity responses that potentially vary by destination has parallel potential
consequences for the border effect coefficient estimates. In terms of the structural model, an
additional term (ln x̄ + ln m̄)(1 − σ)φR /(1 + σφR ) appears in the destination R border coefficient. This structure explains the large magnitude and varying signs of the border estimates
on ηusa,can from Tables 1a-1c as compared to those of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003).
The estimates imply that Canadian imports from US, all else equal, are disproportionately
larger as compared to Canadian exports to US in all but five goods sectors. In those sectors,
the trade balance border estimate for Food is not statistically significant and, not surprisingly, the sectors in which Canada’s exports to US dominate Canada’s imports from US are
Agriculture, Fuels, Wood, and Petroleum and Coal Products. The picture is quite different
for services, where most of the sectoral border estimates of βbrdr are not statistically significant, which translates into an insignificant estimate for aggregate services trade as reported
in column (1) of Table 1c. The four significant services border estimates on ηusa,can are all
negative, which suggests larger Canadian exports in Communication, Education, Health and

22

Other services, all else equal.
It is useful for interpreting results to demonstrate that the estimates of βbrdr from Tables 1a-1c capture the border effects on Canadian imports from US plus the border effects on Canadian exports to US. In particular, Table 2 demonstrates empirically that
βbrdr = βusa,can + βcan,usa . In column (1) of Table 2, we reproduce our main gravity results for aggregate goods trade from the first column of 1a.25 In column (2), we include a
dummy variable for Canada’s exports to US, ηcan,usa , in addition to the border dummy for
Canada’s imports from the main specification, ηusa,can . In order to estimate both directional
border coefficients βusa,can and βcan,usa , we drop one of the exporter, time-varying fixed effects. Then, at the bottom panel of Table 2, we show that the sum of the directional border
estimates from column (2) is exactly equal to the relative border estimate from column (1),
i.e. βbrdr = βusa,can + βcan,usa . Finally, in column (3), we reproduce the experiment after
omitting a different exporter-time fixed effect. As expected, the directional border estimates
from columns (2) and (3) are different, however, their sum is the same and, once again, equal
to the relative border estimate from column (1).
Exchange Rates. There is wide variability in the relative ER effects across sectors. For
some industries, such as Agriculture, Wood, Minerals and Health services, we obtain large,
positive and significant estimates on ER CA EXP , which suggest that the ER effects on
Canadian exports dominate the corresponding effects on Canadian imports. For other categories, such as Apparel, Raw Metals, Chemical Products and Finance Services, the ER effects
on imports are stronger. In the next section, we demonstrate how the estimates of the ER
effects can be used in combination with other gravity estimates to recover the elasticities of
substitution for each sector in our sample.
We conclude by demonstrating that the estimates of βer from Tables 1a-1c are estimates
of the exchange rates effects on Canadian exports relative to Canadian imports that also
net out border effects. The relative ER estimates from column (1) of Table 2 are taken
25

For brevity, we only report the estimates of the border effects and the exchange rates effects.

23

from column 1 of Table 1a. Compare these in Table 2 to the sum of the directional ER
estimates from columns (4) and (5). The latter are obtained simultaneously in each column
at the expense of one dropped exporter-time fixed effect. The comparison reveals that
βer = βer

regardless of the choice of omitted fixed effect.

Inferred Structure

A key question of this paper is whether exchange rates have real effects in gravity models,
which the theory shows boils down to non-uniformity of scale elasticities or passthrough
elasticities. Structural parameters can be inferred from the coefficient estimates of Tables
1a-1c combined with identifying restrictions.
Theoretical restrictions of the model partially identify the structural parameters. Identification is completed with assumed parameter values for either the elasticity of substitution
or of exchange rate passthrough along with the gravity estimates from Tables 1a-1c.

First we obtain estimates of the trade cost scale parameters for Canada and the US from

24

(19)-(21) assuming a substitution elasticity σ. Second, we use (23) and assume complete
passthrough, ρ = 1, to obtain estimates of the elasticity of substitution for each sector.
Finally, we solve for the average (across countries) passthrough elasticity ρ̄ assuming an
elasticity of substitution. The inferred passthrough and scale elasticities yield country specific
net elasticities of price with respect to exchange rates ρ̄ − φR .
Scale Elasticities. The scale parameters are solved from (19)-(21) as:

φcan =

α1 − α2
σα2

and φusa =

α1 − α3
σα3

(24)

Substituting the estimates α̂i ; i − 1, 2, 3 from Tables 1a-1c into (24) and setting σ = 7 yields
the trade-volume parameter estimates of φcan and φusa reported in panel A of Tables 3a-3c,
where we also report the difference φcan − φusa along with standard errors.26
The majority of the scale parameters are small in magnitude but statistically significantly less than zero in 36 of the 56 destination-country/sector cases. In Health services for
Canada’s exports to the US the statistically significant estimate of φusa is suspicious because
it results from the positive elasticity of distance to the US α̂3 . We interpret this result
(which violates the stability condition) as implying a mis-specified trade cost function that
does not appropriately control for trade in health services. (This finding and the generally
imprecise estimation of α̂3 hamper our attempt to identify ρ̄ and σ for services, as presented
below.) On average for all goods Column (1) of Table 3a reports that a 10% rise in trade
volume will lower trade costs to Canada by 1.1% and to the US by 0.5%. In most goods
sectors φcan < φusa , scale economies are more pronounced for Canadian imports (i.e., US
exports to Canada). A rationale is that the larger US market comes closer to exhausting
division of labor economies of scale. The insignificant scale parameters for Fuels are due to
its presumptively mis-specified trade cost equation.
Scale Elasticity and Contiguity. Scale elasticities contribute to the asymmetries in con26

25

tiguity parameter estimates. To ‘remove’ the scale effects, we multiply the estimates of
CON T IG P R ST and CON T IG ST P R by (1 + σφcan ) and by (1 + σφcan ), respectively.
Results are presented in Panels B of Tables 3a-3c, where we also report the original estimates
on CON T IG P R ST and CON T IG ST P R.
Three properties stand out. First, the majority of contiguity effects are smaller after the
‘removal’ the trade volume effects; trade-volume effects contribute to mostly larger contiguity
estimates in each direction of Canadian trade. Second, the differences between the contiguity
estimates after trade-volume effects are accounted for are reduced; i.e., trade-volume effects
increase the difference between the effects of directional contiguity. Third, many of the
contiguity estimates remain positive and significant even after removing volume effects, and
exhibit directional symmetries.
Trade Elasticities. To obtain the elasticity of substitution estimate we assume complete
exchange rate passthrough in each direction of trade between Canada and US, i.e. ρ̄ =
ρcan = ρusa = 1. In that case, equation (23) is rearranged as a quadratic equation to be
solved for the elasticity of substitution:

σ2 +

α̂1 (β̂er + β̂brdr )
σ − 1 = 0.
α̂3 − α̂2

(25)

(25) solves for a unique estimate of σ after eliminating one root by imposing the standard
theoretical restriction 1 − σ < 0.
Sectoral estimates of the trade elasticities of substitution obtained from equation (25) are
reported in Panels C of Tables 3a-3c. Overall, we view the estimates of σ as encouraging for
the goods sectors in our sample. Sixteen of the nineteen possible estimates of the elasticity
of substitution for goods are positive and greater than one, as suggested by theory. Eleven
of these estimates are statistically significant. The estimate of σ = 6.62 (std.err. 1.866)
for aggregate goods is in the middle of the distribution of estimates from related studies,
which vary in the range between 2 and 10,27 and almost all of the other significant elasticity
27

See Eaton and Kortum, 2002, Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003, Broda et al. 2006, and Arkolakis et

26

estimates are within this range too. The three sectors for which we obtain estimates of
σ that are smaller than one (and not statistically significant) are Agriculture, Fuels and
Wood. This is not surprising because these are three of the four sectors for which we did not
estimate significant scale effects (see Panels A of Tables 3a and 3b), and our identification
of σ requires active scale effects.28
The elasticities of substitution for services trade are much less convincing. The underlying
difficulty is imprecise estimates of α3 , the distance elasticity for Canadian exports to the US.
The requirement α̂3 − α̂2 6= 0 in (23) arises mechanically for the equation to be defined, but
the deeper economic implication is that significant scale elasticity difference is needed for
identification because uniform ρ is assumed in deriving (23). With uniform scale elasticities
money is neutral and neither σ nor ρ can be identified from gravity. Despite this, we report
σ values in panel C of Table 3c. All of the elasticities are positive, but only five of the nine
sectoral estimates are statistically significant, and only two of those are greater than one.
The five significant sectoral estimates of σ are for the sectors where we obtain significant
estimates of α̂3 − α̂2 . See Panel D of Table 3c.
Exchange Rate Passthrough. Representative exchange rate passthrough elasticities ρ̄ for
aggregate goods and aggregate services are displayed in Figures 1 and 2 for varying common
elasticities of substitution. For goods, in Figure 1, ρ̄ is typically decreasing in σ.29 By
construction the solution to (23) for each sectoral value of σ reported in Panel C of Tables
3a-3c is always ρ = 1. Figure 1 uses values of sigma between 4 and 12, representative of the
estimates of σ from the existing literature. The results suggest that for reasonable values
of σ, the implied passthrough elasticity ρ̄ is in the unit interval. As a benchmark result,
for aggregate goods trade and σ = 7, ρ̄ = 0.932 and the implied net passthrough elasticity
ρ̄ − φR is 0.986 for the US and 1.04 for Canada.
al., 2011.

The fourth sector for which we do not obtain significant trade-volume estimates is Petroleum and Coal
Products. The corresponding elasticity estimate for this sector is greater than one, but not statistically
significant.

dρ̄/dσ < 0 for (β̂er + β̂brdr )α̂1 /[(1 − σ)(α̂3 − α̂2 )] < 0, which obtains for most sectors.

27

The structural approach to estimating ρ̄ is much less successful with services due to the
identification issue discussed in connection with solving (23) for σ given ρ. Mechanically,
following the procedure of equation (23) with the coefficient point estimates of the services
gravity coefficients produces the results displayed in Figure 2. These are quite implausible
but explained by ρ̄ being unidentified under the theoretical implications of our model.
The test of money neutrality has two components, scale neutrality (φcan − φusa = 0) and
net neutrality (β̂er + β̂brdr = 0), reported in Panel D of Tables 3a-3c. For 13 of 19 goods
sectors, scale neutrality and net neutrality are rejected. The coincidence of the two rejections,
implying rejection of money neutrality, obtains for 12 of the 19. For services, in contrast,
scale neutrality and net neutrality are rejected in 4 of 9 sectors. The only sector for which
both are rejected is Health, a test statistic that is based on an almost surely mis-specified
trade cost function evidenced by a positive distance elasticity for Canada’s exports to the
US. We conclude that money neutrality can be rejected for a majority of goods sectors but
not for services sectors.

Sensitivity Experiments

This section introduces two alternative specifications to address potential endogeneity concerns. A third specification allows for time-varying exchange rate effects. For brevity we
present only the representative results for aggregate goods and services, reported in columns
(1)-(5) and in columns (6)-(10) of Table 4 respectively. We report the base case results for
goods in column (1) of Table 4 (from column 1 of Table 1a), and in column (6) we report
the main estimates for services (from column 1 of Table 1c). The top panel of Table 4,
labeled ‘A. Gravity Estimates,’ presents the gravity estimates from our experiments and in
the bottom panel, labeled ‘B. Parameter Inferences,’ we recover the volume parameters and
the elasticity of substitution.
Begin with goods. Two alternative specifications test for potential endogeneity with
respect to exchange rates. First, in column (2) of Table 4, we use lagged exchange rate
28

values to eliminate any simultaneity between trade and exchange rates. Overall, the results
from column (2) are not statistically different from the main findings from column (1). Three
properties stand out. (i) The estimates of the standard gravity variables in columns (1) and
(2) are virtually identical. This suggests that the ER effects are orthogonal to the effects of
distance, border and contiguity. We exploit this property in the next experiment. (ii) The
estimate of the relative ER effect is still not statistically significant, as it was in the main
results. (iii) We do not find any statistically significant effects on the structural parameters
in our model, which are reported in Panel B. Comparison between the numbers in columns
(6)-(7) reveals that these results are confirmed for services as well.
The second alternative specification applies the methods of Baier and Bergstrand (2007),
who convincingly account for endogeneity of free trade agreements in a similar, structural
gravity setting by including the full set of country-pair fixed effects in addition to the directional (exporter and imported) fixed effects. The intuition is that the bilateral fixed effects
can successfully absorb the correlation between the trade policy variable and the unobservable error term in the gravity model in order to eliminate endogeneity. Applied to our setting,
Baier and Bergstrand’s methodology translates into the following econometric specification:

Xij,t = exp[α̃0 + β̃er ER CA EXP + ψij + ηi,t + θj,t ] + ũij,t ,

(26)

where ψij is the full set of bilateral fixed effects for any two trading partners in our sample,
and all other variables are defined as before. All time-invariant standard gravity covariates
(such as distance for example) will be absorbed by the bilateral fixed effects. To obtain
estimates of the standard gravity variables, which are needed to recover the structural parameters in our model, we apply a two-stage procedure similar to the one from Anderson and
Yotov (2011). In particular, first we estimate (26) to obtain the ER effects after addressing
endogeneity, then we restrict the ER estimates in a constrained second-stage optimization,
where the bilateral fixed effects are replaced with the standard set of gravity variables.

29

Orthogonality between the ER effects and the standard gravity covariates validates this
approach.
Results are reported in column (3) of Table 4. There are no statistically significant
differences from estimates in column (1). In particular, (i) the standard gravity estimates
are identical; (ii) the ER estimates are not statistically significant; and (iii) the structural
parameters from columns (1) and (3) in panel B are not statistically different from each
other. The estimates for services from column (6) and column (8) are identical as well.
In the last experiment, exchange rate effects can vary over time due to splitting the data
in two periods: before and after 2002. Choosing 2002 to allow for time-varying ER effects has
two advantages in addition to being the mid-year in our sample. First, the Canadian dollar
depreciated steadily during the period 1997-2002 , while it appreciated steadily between 2002
and 2007. These patterns provide an opportunity to look for asymmetric trade responses to
ER changes. Second, splitting the time series at 2002 can pick up any changes in trade due
to changes in border security after the 9/11 events.
Pre-2002 and post-2002 estimates for goods are reported in columns (4) and (5) of Table 4,
respectively. Similar estimates of the standard gravity covariates obtain in the two periods.
There are also two important differences between the estimates in columns (4) and (5).
First, we obtain a large positive and statistically significant estimate on ER CA EXP for
the period before 2002, but a negative and significant estimate on ER CA EXP for the
period after 2002. Based on the definition of β̃er , as a relative effect capturing the response
of Canadian exports to US relative to Canadian imports from US, our estimates imply that
when the CA dollar was depreciating, in the pre-2002 period, Canadian exports responded
much more than Canadian imports. The trade response was asymmetric in the post-2002
period too, when the CA dollar was steadily appreciating. This time however, the response of
Canadian imports was stronger than the response of Canadian exports. Hence, the negative
estimates of β̃er for the post-2002 period. The implication of these results is that the response
of Canadian trade to exchange rate fluctuations is directionally asymmetric. Our findings also

30

support the hypothesis that the passthrough of depreciation is stronger than the passthrough
of appreciation, taking the scale elasticity as constant. Thus our results are consistent with
those of Delatte and Lopez-Villavicencio (2012) based on price comparison data.
The second difference between columns (4) and (5) is between the estimates of the structural parameters. There is an insignificant estimate of φusa in the post-2002 period (column
8), although the estimate lies within 2 standard deviations of the pre-2002 estimate. The
mechanical reason for the significance test result is that the standard error doubles in the
post-2002 period. Interpreting this weak evidence as indicating a fall in the scale elasticity
(in absolute value), the result is consistent with a thickening of the US border after 9/11. It
should be emphasized that scale effect inference is identified independently of exchange rate
effects so it is not subject to passthrough asymmetry.
For services there are no significant differences between the pre-2002 and post-2002 estimates. This finding underlines the conclusion drawn from the main results that the scale
and passthrough channels are weakly identified in the services data, and splitting the data
does not help. The results are reported in columns (9) and (10) of Table 4.
The sensitivity experiments support the base findings from Sections 4.1 and 4.2. The
main addition is evidence of differences in the response of goods trade flows to exchange rate
appreciations as opposed to depreciation.

Conclusion

We develop a structural model that can identify the effects of exchange rates in the structural
gravity model. Exchange rate influence moves through two channels, a volume scale effect in
trade costs and incomplete exchange rate passthrough. Non-uniformity of either passthrough
or scale induces relative price effects of exchange rate changes. Our application to the trade
of Canadian provinces with the US suggests that these channels are active.
Our theory and results suggest that gravity modeling should allow for variable returns

31

to scale trade technology. This significant departure from constant returns points toward a
richer model that includes infrastructure detail as a determinant of bilateral trade. Application to more disaggregated trade data would permit direct measures of trade volume to be
used to directly identify scale elasticities, increasing the precision of estimation. Disaggregation would also permit examination of more detailed analysis of scale effects, such as allowing
for multiple points of entry in borders, multiple modes of transport and infrastructure details.
Another novel implication of the extended trade cost function developed here is that
trade-volume effects can be used in combination with an exogenously given exchange rate
passthrough elasticity to recover estimates of the trade elasticity of substitution. Our results
suggest that this is a promising method of identifying substitution elasticities.

This table reports PPML gravity estimates of the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on Canadian services trade. Column (1) includes
estimates for aggregate services and the numbers in the next nine columns are for individual sectors. All estimates are obtained with timevarying, directional (importer and exporter) fixed effects and the years included in our sample are 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007.
The dependent variable is nominal exports. Standard errors in parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < .05, ** p < .01. See text for more details.

This table reports quantitative implications based on our theory. In panel A, we recover scale parameters for Canada and for US. Panel B,
offers quantitative implications for the effects of contiguity on trade between Canadian provinces and US states. In panel C, we obtain estimates of
the elasticity of substitution. Finally, in panel D, we report tests for money neutrality. See text for further details. Standard errors, constructed with
the Delta method, are reported in in parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < .05, ** p < .01.

Appendix B: Technical Notes
This appendix provides technical notes on multilateral scale elasticities and our model of
Pricing to Market with industry data. It closes with a derivation of the stability condition
for the model with increasing returns trade technology.

5.1

Bilateral vs. Multilateral Scale Models

It is useful to gain perspective by reviewing the bilateral scale trade costs model of the text
before proceeding to the multilateral case.
The gravity equation with exporter and importer fixed effects is given by

Xij = xi mj t1−σ
ij .

(27)

Let the trade cost be given by

tij = τij

ri
rj

ρj

φ

Vij j .

(28)

where τij denotes a log-linear function of the standard set of trade cost gravity variables
augmented by passthrough of bilateral exchange rate change ri /rj at passthrough elasticity
ρj , and where volume shipped from i to j is Vij . Congestion effects are a natural interpretation of φj > 0, representing the crowding of fixed capacity ports and border entry points
while division of labor is a natural interpretation of IRS. The scale effect applies to bilateral
volume.
Volume is given by
Vij = Xij /(tij ri /rj )

(29)

where the deflator removes the effect of exchange rate appreciation (that raises ‘factory gate’
prices pki ), and also removes the volume lost in transit, so that the volume relevant to the
congestion is measured at destination size.
Use (27) in (29) and substitute the result into (28) to solve for the reduced form trade

47

cost function repeated from (7):

1/(1+σφj )
tij = τij (xi mj )φ (ri /rj )ρj −σj
.

The key implication is that when congestion is important enough, φj > ρj , the effect of an
appreciation of i’s bilateral exchange rate is to lower trade costs from i to j.
It is alternatively natural to think that congestion affects all exporters simultaneously,
as when ships must wait to enter a port irrespective of their nationality. Or, division of
labor may naturally apply to all the exporters to a given market when they access various
intermediaries. Reality combines aspects of the bilateral and multilateral extremes. The pure
multilateral case, while more complex than the pure bilateral case, still remains manageably
simple. More important, the qualitative properties of the effect of an appreciation of exporter
i’s exchange rate on the value of bilateral trade from i to destination j remain the same:
sufficiently important congestion implies that an appreciation of i’s exchange rate will lower
trade costs from i to j.
Let the trade cost function be given by

tij = τij

ri

ρj

.

(30)

k6=j

Now all exporters crowd the shipments to j. Again we can solve for a reduced from trade
cost that eliminates the endogenous volume.
Substitute (27) into (29) and substitute the result into (30). This yields, after simplification,

tij = τij

We can simplify (31) by taking advantage of a relationship between exporter trade costs into

48

destination j that is implied by (27):
tkj



ri

ρj
(32)

Multiply both sides of (32) by tij and substitute the result into (31). Simplify further to
obtain:



ρj /(1+σφj ) 

τ−j is a CES index of bilateral trade costs into j facing all exporters except j where the
weights are the exporter fixed effects. r−j is a CES index of exchange rates excluding j’s.
The weights are (τkj /τ−j )−σ xk /x−j , exporter fixed effect weights adjusted for the volume
shifting effects of variation in τkj relative to its average τ−j .
Interpreting (33), consider first the special case of φj → 0 ⇒ tij → τij (ri /rj )ρj . Reverting
to iceberg trade costs, exchange rate passthrough acts like a tax on exports. Once volume
effects on trade costs are active, the remainder of (33) applies. The rightmost term is a
scale of activity effect. The two middle terms in relative exchange rates act intuitively: a
rise in the bilateral exchange rate raises trade costs (it acts like an export tax) while a rise
in the cross-rate ri /r−j lowers trade costs because the reduction in volume from i reduces
congestion, conferring a cost reduction to all exporters to j. Moving leftward, the direct
bilateral trade costs τij are offset by the index of direct costs from all exporters into j, τ−j .

49

Note that (33) retains the property that tij is decreasing in ri if φj > ρj , ∂tij /∂ri > 0,
just as in the bilateral scale case. While cumbersome, (33) remains tractable in the simple
way it brings in all third party effects as they affect the bilateral trade cost from i to j
through scale effects.

5.2

Pricing to Market

There is ample evidence in the literature that firms sell identical goods to different markets
at prices that differ by more than the trade cost differentials between them. This could be
due to unobserved trade costs but also could reflect pricing to market by monopolistically
competitive firms.
The standard monopoly pricing theory implies that profit maximizing firms mark up
prices relative to costs using the inverse (demand) elasticity formula. Exchange rate changes
shift the relative costs of serving various markets and can potentially change markups because the new equilibrium has changed elasticities of demand facing the firms in the various
markets. With small numbers of monopolistic firms, pricing to market does produce effects
that vary by market.
The firm’s markup is derived from the profit maximizing condition that marginal revenue
should be equal to marginal cost in each market. This yields the condition that the ratio of
price to marginal cost should be equal to

1/(1 + 1/)

(34)

where  is the elasticity of demand facing the firm.
The CES demand system is the rationale for the structural gravity model. For CES
demand the formula for the elasticity of demand facing firm h based in country i, selling in

50

market j in some generic sector with superscript suppressed for clarity is given by:

ih = −σ(1 − sjih )

(35)

where σ is the parametric elasticity of substitution among varieties, common to all markets,
sjih is the share of firm h from country i in total sales in market j, including sales of other
firms based in i and all the firms not based in i.
A standard case in the monopolistic competition literature simplifies to the small firms
case of sjih → 0. Applying specification (35) to markup formula (34) in this case yields
σ/(σ − 1), implying constant markups.
In contrast, more usefully for investigating pricing to market, with finite market shares
in (35), elasticities of demand do vary across markets and thus so do markups. Substituting
from (35) into (34) and simplifying for the general case yields markup formula
1 − sjih
.
1 − sjih − 1/σ

(36)

In this situation, when costs change, as with an exchange rate change, the equilibrium shares
of the firms will change and the markups given by (36) move in response. The markup is
increasing the the share,30 while the share presumably decreases with appreciation of i’s
exchange rate, hence markups fall with appreciation.
For many markets, this action of exchange rates on markups will be small (see the
preceding footnote). With large values of σ, the markup factor given by (36) will be close
to 1 no matter what the value of sjih . A standard range of elasticities for goods markets is
6 to 10, implying small response of markups to exchange rates. (Services trade is too little
explored to predict a range of elasticities, but these may be lower.) Also, when firm’s shares
30

The elasticity of the markup in (36) with respect to the share is
sih /σ
(1 − sjih − 1/σ)(1 − sih )

51

.

are small, the markups are confined close to σ/(σ − 1) and won’t have much movement in
the data.
In the absence of firm level trade data the market shares are not observable and we could
not draw inferences from aggregate data about changing markups based on the structure
of (36). We attempted pretending that there was a monopoly middleman in each market
who marked up according (36) replacing sjih with the observable bilateral market share of
P
all firms in i selling to j, sji = h sjih . Since markups are based on perceived elasticities we
assumed that the middleman used lagged shares to calculate an elasticity of demand. This
version of our model was unable to gain any traction on the data.

5.3

Stability with Increasing Returns

With increasing returns to scale, the supply of trade services function slopes downward.
Stable equilibrium arises when the supply of trade services function cuts the demand function from below under the plausible dynamic adjustment assumption that quantity supplied
adjusts toward quantity demanded. Consider the standard quantity adjustment analysis in
(ln tij , ln Xij ) space with the familiar Marshallian scissors diagram (not drawn).
On the demand side, taking logs of the CES expenditure function (27) and suppressing
irrelevant terms, the buyers’ willingness to pay for trade services is given by

ln tij =

1
ln Xij .
1−σ

(37)

On the supply side, taking logs of (28), suppressing irrelevant terms and using ln Vij =
ln Xij − ln tij yields the cost of services supplied as

ln tij =

1
φj
ln τij +
ln Xij .
1 + φj
1 + φj

(38)

The equilibrium defined by the intersection of (37) and (38) is locally stable under the
quantity adjustment assumption if 0 > φj /(1 + φj ) > 1/(1 − σ). Simplifying the rightmost
52

inequality yields the stability condition 1 + σφj > 0. QED.
With the constant elasticity structure imposed on supply and demand, the existence of a
stable interior equilibrium depends on the vertical intercept of (37) lying above the vertical
intercept of (38). Taking account of the suppressed constant term in (37) that includes the
positive frictionless value of trade and the positive value of ln Πi Pj , the condition is ordinarily
met, though a high enough constant term (suppressed) in (38) can violate it. (Technically,
zero bilateral trade flows would result from the condition not being met. There are not many
zeroes in our data, but the proportion rises with disaggregation.)
