ABSTRACT
We analyze the economic returns to different postsecondary degrees in Chile. We posit a schooling
decision model with unobserved ability, observed test scores and labor market outcomes. We benefit
from administrative records to carry out our empirical strategy. Our results show positive average
returns to postsecondary degrees, especially for five-year degrees. However, we also uncover a large
fraction of individuals with realized negative net returns. Although psychic benefits of postsecondary
education could rationalize this result, we argue this might also suggest that individuals lack information
at the time schooling decisions are made. Finally, our findings illustrate the importance of allowing
for heterogeneous treatment effects when making policy recommendations.

Introduction

The vast evidence suggesting average positive returns to postsecondary education has contributed to the rapid worldwide expansion of the higher education sector.1 However, concerns
about the weak labor market performance of recent college graduates in developed and developing countries, uncertainty about the quality of institutions of higher education, the
climbing tuition costs, and the accumulation of large student debts are challenging the presumption that a postsecondary degree confers financial security.2 In this paper, we analyze
this phenomenon by estimating heterogeneous treatment effects within and across postsecondary degrees using data from Chile. Our intuition is simple: investing in higher education
can deliver positive average returns, while still yielding a negative economic return for many
individuals.
We study Chile’s highly competitive postsecondary education system. Our empirical
model allows observationally equivalent individuals to face different returns to education
depending on their unobserved endowments. Chile is particularly interesting because until
recently its schooling system was regarded a success. However, over the past few years the
system has received criticisms form a number of different sources. Many of the criticisms
could also be applied to the postsecondary educational system in a variety of developed and
developing countries.
This paper contributes to the literature analyzing the returns to education in the context
of models with unobserved heterogeneity (Willis and Rosen, 1979; Card, 1993, 2001; Kane
and Rouse, 1995; Taber, 2001; Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil, 2006; Carneiro, Heckman, and
Vytlacil, 2011). It also contributes to the literature estimating schooling choices in complex

Between 1998 and 2010, the number of students in tertiary education increased by 53% in the United States,
46% in Australia, 65% in Mexico (source: OECD). In China the figure has soared to more than 31 millions in 2010,
up from 23 million students in 2005 (source: National Bureau of Statistics of China), with the numbers of private
universities increasing from 20 in 1997 to 630 in 2010 (source: Center for International Higher Education at Boston
College).

In 2010 the unemployment rate among recent college graduates in the US ranged between 5.4 and 13.9%.
The large dispersion can be explained by major, illustrating the potential risk of unemployment (source: American
Community Survey, 2009 and 2010). In China, 6.4% of the urban population between the ages of 21 and 25 with an
undergraduate degree or higher were unemployed (source: Chinese Household Finance Survey Center of Chengdus
Southwestern University of Finance and Economics). Average published tuition and fees at public four-year colleges
and universities in the US increased by 31% beyond the rate of inflation over the five years from 2002 to 2007, and
by another 27% between 2007 and 2012 (source: The College Board, Annual Survey of Colleges; NCES, IPEDS).
Finally, two-thirds of U.S. college seniors graduated in 2011 with an average student loan debt of $26,600, a 5.3%
increase relative to 2010 (source: Project on Student Debt).

a few prior studies have analyzed the economic returns to tertiary education in developing
countries, our approach represents a significant improvement from previous work in three
critical dimensions.3 First, we explicitly model the schooling decision of high school graduates over all available educational alternatives. We assume individuals decide on a type
of postsecondary degree using an unordered discrete choice model. Second, our model allows for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity, which is interpreted as unobserved ability.
More precisely, we assume that schooling decisions depend on an individual’s observed characteristics and latent ability (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006; Urzua, 2008). We also
investigate the role of short-term credit constraints within this framework. Third,
our results show the importance of understanding the structure of the economic agent’s
schooling decision process when determining the returns to education (Card, 2001; Heckman,
Lochner, and Todd, 2006; Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil, 2008). We estimate returns to
postsecondary degrees while taking into account the structure of the underlying schooling
decision model. In particular, we generate two different returns for each type of postsecondary
degree. First, we compare the economic benefits of each postsecondary degree to those
obtained when not continuing to postsecondary studies. We also exploit the structure of our
schooling choice model to compare the returns to each type of degree with the predicted
returns to the second-best alternative We document large heterogeneity for both types of
returns.
The empirical strategy is implemented with longitudinal data containing administrative
information from several sources. Our initial sample contains information on the universe
of graduates from higher education institutions in Chile in 2008. We integrate this data
with information from the national college admission system (2001-2007) which contains rich
information on test scores and individual demographic and socio-economic variables. Finally,
we observe each student’s labor market outcomes through 2011 using administrative registers
of earnings.
Our main results can be summarized as follows:

1. We find substantial heterogeneity in the returns to postsecondary degrees. We show
that the average economic returns to five-year postsecondary degrees are highest among
all the available alternatives. However, a significant fraction of individuals face negative
net returns: between 35% and 42% depending on the type of degree and institution.
These individuals would have been financially better off if choosing not to attend tertiary
education. The likelihood of observing negative returns is higher when analyzing the
return that compares the first-best versus the second-best option. Furthermore, our
findings indicate that, conditional on type of degree, individuals endowed with larger
stocks of unobserved ability obtain higher economic returns relative to lower ability
individuals. Also, we find that individuals with higher latent ability are more likely to
enroll in institutions with higher labor market returns.
2. We use our model to carry out policy simulations. In particular, we analyze the effects
of a reduction in postsecondary tuition costs. We find that a 10% reduction in all tuition
costs has minimal impact on overall enrollment, but it produces important composition
effects. This confirms the importance of allowing for heterogeneity between types of
postsecondary degrees. Furthermore, the small change in overall employment suggests
that short-term financial constraints might not be binding in the Chilean case. This
result is consistent with evidence for the United States (Cameron and Heckman, 2001;
Carneiro and Heckman, 2002), but is new in the context of developing countries.
3. We provide empirical evidence that sources of observed and unobserved heterogeneity
must be understood and treated as distinct but connected phenomena (Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen, 2004; Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006). Indeed, we show that the
sorting patterns into postsecondary schooling alternatives differ depending on whether
they are generated using observed tests scores or the underlying latent ability.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the main features of
the Chilean postsecondary education system. Section 3 describes our economic model and
empirical strategy and presents a detailed analysis of our data. This section also defines the
treatment effects of interest. Section 4 discusses the main empirical findings. Finally, section
5 concludes.

The Postsecondary Education System in Chile

Chile’s postsecondary education system has experienced rapid development over the last
thirty years. The process began in 1981 with a reform that stimulated the entry of private institutions to the tertiary education system. As a result, the country transitioned
from a postsecondary educational system dominated by public providers to one driven by
competition between public and private institutions. The reform also increased the range of
available postsecondary degrees. Before 1981, the vast majority of college graduates obtained
five-year college degrees. After 1981, postsecondary institutions started offering two-, four-,
and five-year degrees. The institutions offering two-year postsecondary degrees are known
as Technical Institutes (TI or Centros de Formación Técnica), those offering four-year postsecondary degrees are know as Professional Institutes (PI or Institutos Profesionales), while
universities continue offering five-year college degrees.4 Additionally, depending on the source
of funding, universities can be further divided in three subcategories: Public, Private with
access to public funding (PPF) and Private without access to public funding (Private).
More than thirty years after the original reform, Chile’s postsecondary system is again
under fire (OECD, 2009). Recently, the system has been criticized for a number of reasons.
Arguably excessive tuition costs fueled an intense public debate, with many groups advocating for more tuition subsidies.5 At the same time, the quality of many higher education
institutions has been questioned by students, public media, and even the government. Even
though a large fraction of the students finance their education using private loans, the system
is characterized by serious information problems. In fact, until recently, students did not have
information on the employment prospects associated with different careers and postsecondary
institutions when deciding where or whether to enroll. As a result of this, nothing prevented
students (and their families) from making poorly informed financing decisions, which could
lead to non-optimal outcomes from public and private perspectives. Our findings are consistent with this intuition. Many of these criticisms apply to the postsecondary schooling

4

The number of postsecondary institutions in Chile rose from eight universities in 1980 to almost two hundred
institutions in 2008 (61 universities, 45 PIs and 90 TIs). Also, the reform had an enormous impact in enrollment.
Between 1984 and 2009, the enrollment in postsecondary institutions grew almost 363% (from 189,151 to 876,243
students).

Between 2005 and 2011, the average tuition had a real growth of 15%, from US$3,292 to US$3,785.

systems in other developed and developing countries.6
In Chile, access to postsecondary education is merit-based. Students who wish to attend
college must take a national college admission test known as the PSU (Prueba de Selección
Universitaria). Conditional on their PSU scores, high school graduates choose between
enrolling in a postsecondary institution or entering directly into the labor market. Students
are required to score a minimum of 450 points on the PSU to apply to PI (leading to fouryear degrees) and universities (five-year degrees).7 The only requirement for applying to TI
(two-year degrees) is to have taken the PSU. Therefore, students with PSU scores higher
than 450 points can choose among a wider variety of careers and postsecondary institutions.
In addition to the general score guideline, each tertiary institution can choose to set an even
more restrictive minimum score requirement. This is usually determined by the number of
spots available.
This process produces positive sorting between academic performance, as measured by
PSU scores, and enrollment by type of degree and institution. Figure 1 shows that most
of the students with high PSU scores have higher unconditional probabilities of attending a
university. The sorting profile is strongly influenced by students’ socioeconomic background.
As figure 2 documents, over 60% of the students whose gross family income is higher than
2,800 dollars per month (the average family income in 2008) enroll in private universities.
Students with more educated mothers are also more likely to attend private and public
universities (figure 3).
There are also significant differences in the labor market performance across postsecondary degrees and institutions (within a degree type). Figure 4 presents the average annual
earnings received one and two years after graduation. The average earnings premium to
graduating from PPF is the highest among the available degrees. Two- and four-year degrees
present the lowest average premia. These results are confirmed in table 1, which presents the

This motivates the regression discontinuity (RD) strategy used in Hastings, Neilson, and Zimmerman (2012),
a recent study that came out to our attention after the first draft of this paper. The RD approach identifies the
local return to education for those individuals above and below the cutoff. Our paper seeks to trace out the whole
distribution of returns to education.

where wi represents monthly earnings, Xi contains several demographic and socio-economic
characteristics (gender, age, mother’s education, family income), Ti is the vector of test
scores (language, math, among others), Di,s is a binary indicator taking a value of one if
the individual reports s as his postsecondary degree, and zero otherwise; J is the set of all
available degrees, and ui is the error term. The information on postsecondary degrees (2008)
and monthly earnings (2010) come from the Chilean postsecondary schooling system and the
unemployment insurance system, respectively. We describe our data in more detail in section
3.5.8
After accounting for individual characteristics, PPF and public universities exhibit the
highest economic returns: 112.2% and 101.6%, respectively (first column in table 1). These
estimated returns decrease when we control for family background characteristics (columns
2 and 3) but they remain higher for PPF and Public universities than for TI and PI. When
we add measures of academic performance (college admission tests and high school GPA),
the estimated returns decrease further, but are still larger for PPF and public universities
(columns 4 and 5).
However, to interpret these estimates as the causal effects of postsecondary degrees on
earnings, we would need to make the strong assumption that, conditional on observed test
scores Ti and Xi , the set of dummy variables {Di,s }j∈J is independent from ui . In other
words, we would need to assume that selection is based exclusively on observed characteristics.
Cameron and Heckman (2001) and Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004) provide evidence
that this is not a reasonable assumption. Individuals consider both observed and unobserved
characteristics when sorting into schooling levels. On the other hand, labor market outcomes

As described below, we analyze administrative academic records from the total population of graduates from
higher institutions in Chile in 2008. This information contains standardized test scores (from PSU database), high
school GPA and socio-economic variables for individuals who graduated from postsecondary institutions in 2008.
Our sample includes individuals obtaining two-year TI degrees, four-year PI degrees and five-year university degrees
(Public, PPF and Private). Additionally, we have information on individuals who took PSU in 2007 and decided
not to enroll in postsecondary institutions, in 2008 or 2009. This sample defines the baseline category in table 1.
We link the academic records to monthly earning information from 2010.

are also determined by latent abilities (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006). Therefore,
to the extent that observed test scores are not perfect proxies for latent ability, we can
not provide a causal interpretation to the results in table 1. Furthermore, these results do
not account for the direct tuition costs of education. As table 2 shows, these costs can
be substantial.9 Consequently, we follow a different strategy in which we explicitly model
schooling choices as a function of observed and unobserved characteristics, and compute the
returns to postsecondary degrees net of tuition costs.

3

The Economic Model and Empirical Strategy

We posit a model of unordered schooling decisions. Conditional on unobserved ability, agents
make schooling choices based on the comparison of the net expected utility associated with
each postsecondary degree.10 This utility includes the potential economic benefits as well as
monetary and psychic costs. The inclusion of psychic costs (or benefits) allows students to
select alternatives that might not be optimal from a financial perspective.
We supplement the previous framework with a model of labor market outcomes (earnings)
by type of degree. We assume that these outcomes are determined by the agent’s observed
and unobserved characteristics. Unobserved components, which we interpret as latent ability,
generate a correlation between schooling choices and individual labor market outcomes. This
delivers a model with essential heterogeneity, which allows for observationally equivalent individuals to experience different treatment effects even if they are making the same schooling
decisions (Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil, 2006). We estimate a variety of treatment effects
and analyze how they change with the level of unobserved ability.

3.1

The Schooling Choice Model

After graduating from high school, individuals decide between enrolling in one of the available
higher education institutions, which leads to a specific degree, or entering the labor market.

9

See Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2008) for a precise discussion of the assumptions behind the Mincer model
and their empirical justification.
10
See Willis and Rosen (1979), Cameron and Heckman (1998, 2001), Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003)
and Cameron and Taber (2004) for models with similar characteristics.

8

Let J denote the set of all choices, and j be a specific degree type, i.e., j ∈ J .11 Schooling
choices depend on observed and unobserved characteristics. Let θ denote the unobserved
individual endowment, which we interpret as latent ability. We assume θ is known to the
agent.
We setup our choice model as in Cameron and Heckman (2001) and Heckman, Humphries,
Urzua, and Veramendi (2011). Let Vij be the utility for student i of choosing option j. This
incorporates the economic returns as well as monetary and psychic costs for each alternative.
We approximate Vij using the following linear function (for simplicity, we suppress the i
index):
Vj = XjV βjV + αjV θ + νjV ,

(1)

where Xj presents the vector of exogenous characteristics, θ is unobserved ability and νjV is
the error term. We assume that conditional on individual characteristics, schooling choices
are unordered. More precisely, agents choose the alternative that yields the highest expected
utility:
j ∗ = arg max E(Vj |Ω)
j∈J

where Ω denotes the information set available to the individual. It includes observed and unobserved variables as well as the structure of the model. Later, we analyze the consequences of
using unordered choices in the estimation of the returns to education in traditional structural
schooling models (Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil, 2008).
Let Dj denote an indicator function for option j defined as:

Dj =



 1 if j = arg maxk∈J E(Vk |Ω)

 0 otherwise

We utilize Dj to define the treatment effects of postsecondary degrees.
Finally, we assume that agents graduate from high school at t = 0, and that each postsecondary degree has a specific duration. We denote by Sj the duration associated with
postsecondary degree j. For students who decide not to continue on to postsecondary education, Sj = 0. For the rest of the alternatives, Sj > 0.
11

We exclude from our model schooling decisions beyond postsecondary degrees and any possibility of dropping
out after enrolling.

9

3.2

Labor Market Outcomes

Let yj (Sj ) denote annual initial earnings after obtaining a degree of type j. Likewise, let
gj (t, t + 1) denote the associated growth rate of earnings between t and t + 1. We can
characterize the earnings profile for an agent graduating from degree j as:

yj (t) = 0

0 < t < Sj

(2)

yj (t) = yj (Sj ) × (1 + gj (Sj , Sj + 1)) × . . . × (1 + gj (t − 1, t))

Sj ≤ t ≤ T

(3)

where T denotes the retirement period, which we assume is common to all individuals.
These expressions represent our model of counterfactual labor market outcomes and, as
discussed below, they are the critical ingredients behind our estimated economic returns to
postsecondary degrees.12
In the empirical implementation of the counterfactual outcome models, we assume that
labor market outcomes are determined by observed characteristics as well as unobserved
ability in the following manner:13

where



yj (Sj ) = Xjy βjy + αjy θ + νjy

(4)

gj (Sj , Sj + 1) = Xjg (Sj )βjg + αjg θ + νjg

(5)




Xjy , Xjg (Sj ) represent vectors of exogenous controls, and νjy , νjg are the error

terms.
We use a conventional switching regression framework to define observed initial earnings
y(Sj ) and growth rates g(Sj , Sj + 1):

y(Sj ) =

X

Dj × yj (Sj )

j∈J

g(Sj , Sj + 1) =

X

Dj × gj (Sj , Sj + 1)

j∈J
12

Given a specific degree type, individuals could enroll into different fields or disciplines (social sciences, biological
sciences, computer science, etc). To the extent our schooling decision model captures the selection into types, and
our labor market equations capture the heterogeneity between and within degree types, the selection into disciplines
should not affect our identification strategy and the interpretation of the main results.
13
This is similar to the empirical strategy in Willis and Rosen (1979), although we relax the assumption of
normality.

10

Note that θ affects labor market productivity as well as schooling choices. This unobserved
factor is what drives the endogeneity of schooling decisions in our model.

3.3

Measurement System for Unobserved Endowments

The identification of the model of schooling choices and counterfactual labor market outcomes
hinges on the identification of the distribution of unobserved ability θ, fθ (·). We follow the
strategy in Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003) and Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004),
and obtain this distribution using the information from a set of measurements (test scores).
Let T be a vector of individual-level test scores (with at least three components) observed
before the agent faces the postsecondary education decision problem. We assume a system
of linear equations of the form:

T = XT β T + α T θ + ν T

(6)

where XT represents a vector of exogenous controls, and ν T is the vector of residuals. Notice
that the link between test scores and θ supports our interpretation of θ as latent ability.
Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003) show that in this context, the distribution of θ is
non-parametrically identified up to a normalization of a single coefficient in αT . We rely on
their theory to develop our empirical analysis. For further details on the identifying assumptions of discrete-continuous factor models of endogenous decisions, labor market outcomes
and test scores, see also Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004).

3.4

The returns to postsecondary degrees

As mentioned earlier, the model allows for the identification of average and distributional
treatment effects (Aakvik, Heckman, and Vytlacil, 2005). We focus on the impact of postsecondary degrees on labor market outcomes as defined by equations (4) and (5). Specifically,
we use the models of initial earnings and growth rates to simulate the net economic benefits

11

of each degree type j ∈ J using the following expression:

P Vj =

T
X
t=Sj

Sj −1
X Cj (t)
ŷj (t)
−
(1 + r)t
(1 + r)t

(7)

t=0

where ŷj (t) represents the predicted earnings in period t for degree type j (see expression
(3)) and Cj (t) denotes the respective annual tuition costs.
It is worth mentioning that P Vj is not necessarily an estimate of Vj . In our model, an
individual may not choose the alternative that yields the highest economic returns. Allowing
for Vj to include psychic costs rationalizes a model in which individuals make optimal choices
based on expected net utility, but may not make the best financial decision (Cameron and
Heckman, 2001; Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro, 2005). Differences between P Vj and Vj
could also be due to individual having a distorted information set available at the time of the
decision and/or forecast errors. However, Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2006) find that
forecast errors explain only a small portion of the gap between Vj and P Vj in the United
States.14
We use this methodology to analyze two alternative definitions of the net economic returns
to postsecondary degrees. First, we compare each option against the alternative of not
continuing onto postsecondary studies. This is the traditional definition of the individual’s
return to postsecondary education. Individuals choosing not to continue to postsecondary
education have a stream of earnings defined by y0 (t) and g0 (t, t + 1), while C0 (t) = 0 for all
t. The present discounted value of the no postsecondary schooling choice is given by:

P V0 =

T
X
ŷ0 (t)
(1 + r)t

(8)

t=0

where r denotes the relevant interest rate.
Let ∆0j represent the purely financial benefit or loss (that is, excluding psychic costs or
benefits) to choosing option j instead of no postsecondary education. ∆0j is defined at the
individual-level as:

∆0j = P Vj − P V0
14

(9)

In this paper we do not decompose the gap between Vj and P Vj into uncertainty and psychic costs.

12

However, in analyzing the costs and benefits of a particular choice j, the agent compares
its associated benefits and costs against those from all alternatives in J , not just to the no
postsecondary schooling option. In particular, if for some j, k both in J , ∆0j > 0 and ∆0k > 0,
then the relevant comparison is between P Vj and P Vk . Following this intuition, our second
definition for the return to postsecondary degrees is based on the comparison of the benefits
and costs associated with the first-best versus second-best alternatives. Specifically, let j ∗
and k ∗ be the first and second best options, respectively. That is:

j ∗ = argmaxj∈J {Vj }
k ∗ = argmaxk∈J |−j ∗ {Vk },

and let P Vj ∗ and P Vk∗ be the corresponding net economic benefits. We define the following
individual-level treatment parameter:
∗

∆kj ∗

= P Vj ∗ − P Vk∗ ,

(10)

which identifies the economic benefits of graduating from the first-best option, j ∗ , versus the
second-best alternative k ∗ With ∆0j and ∆kj , we can estimate the average treatment on the
treated effect as follows:

T Tj0 ≡

ZZ

T Tjk

ZZ  X

≡

∆0j [(Xjy (t), Xjg (t)) = x, θ = z]dFX,θ|Dj =1 (x, z)

∆kj [(Xjy (t), Xjg (t)) = x, θ = z] × Pr Dk∈J |−j = 1 |Dj = 1 dFX,θ|Dj =1,Dk∈J |−j =1 (x, z)

k∈J |−j

(12)
where the indicator function Dk∗ ∈J |−j ∗ takes a value of 1 if k ∗ is the optimal choice in J
when j ∗ is excluded, and 0 otherwise.
Equation (11) is the usual expression for estimating treatment on the treated effects for
a particular schooling level.15 T Tj0 assumes that the relevant counterfactual for estimating
average treatment effects is the alternative of not graduating from any postsecondary alternative. Equation (12) is a modification of the conventional definition. Given that we are
15

See, e.g., Aakvik, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2005) and Heckman, Humphries, Urzua, and Veramendi (2011).

13

considering different choices within a particular set of options, our average treatment on the
treated effect should be averaged over the probability of k being the second-best choice given
that Dj = 1. In this way, T Tjk offers a different and potentially more realistic perspective to
the returns to education.

3.5

Empirical Implementation

Data. Our data include administrative records on individual-level postsecondary degrees,
test scores and earnings. The information on postsecondary degrees comes from administrative registers from the Chilean Ministry of Education. Table 3 presents the list of institutions
from which we observe the universe of postsecondary degrees granted in 2008. We have information from 69 TIs, 36 PIs, 16 Public universities and 30 Private universities. We gather
information on PSU test scores from the postsecondary admission test system for the period 2001-2007 (PSU).16 The PSU evaluates students’ proficiency in the subjects of math,
language, geography and science. This data also contains a rich set of individual-level information, including each student’s socio-economic characteristics and average GPA during
high school.
Information on labor market outcomes comes from the Ministry of Labor’s Unemployment Insurance System (UIS). The UIS records monthly earnings for all workers with formal
contracts in the country since November 2002. By 2010, the data contains information from
more than 7 million workers.17,18
In order to estimate the economic benefits to not graduating from a postsecondary institution, we build a comparison group (control group) using individuals entering the labor
market right after finishing high school in 2007. We construct this group by gathering information from administrative records on those enrolled in higher education institutions and
the college admission system. Specifically, we identify individuals that took PSU in 2007, but
16

Between 2001 and 2003, PAA (Prueba de Aptitud Academica) was the national college admission test. The
data description applies for both PAA and PSU.
17
According to the Chilean Bureau of Statistics, average quarterly employment in the country was 7,1 million
in 2010.
18
The total number of individuals obtained a postsecondary degree in 2008 is 50,0041. After deleting observations
with missing information on exogeneous controls and monthly earnings, we end up with 31,045 observations. On
the other hand, 51,031 individuals participated in the college admission process in 2007 (took PSU) but did not
enroll in any postsecondary institution in 2008 or 2009. After deleting observations with missing information on
exogeneous controls and monthly earnings, we end up with 26,114 observations.

did not appear enrolled in 2008 or 2009. In this way, we compare the labor market outcomes
of those graduating from postsecondary institutions in 2008 to individuals entering the labor
market at the same time, without any postsecondary schooling.19
We use the math, language and geography PSU scores to estimate the measurement
system described in equation (6). We include average high school GPA (obtained from PSU
records) as part of the measurement system. Because 2008 graduates might come from
careers with different durations, we obtain their PSU test scores from several different years.
We look for PSU scores in administrative records over the period 2001 to 2005. Because the
PSU scores are not comparable over time, we use year-specific percentiles as our measures of
academic performance. The list of covariates in the measurement system includes age, gender,
and mother’s education, all of which are obtained from the PSU administrative records.
In our multinomial choice estimations, we include as exogenous controls gender, age
(2008), mother’s education and family income (from PSU records). We also incorporate
average regional tuition costs for each potential postsecondary degree. This information
contributes to the identification of our schooling choice model (Card, 1999; Heckman and
Navarro, 2007).
For labor market outcomes, we use the monthly earnings between August 2008 and July
2009 to construct average monthly earnings in 2008. This is our dependent variable in
equation (4).20 Analogously, we use earnings between August 2010 and July 2011 to construct
the average monthly earnings for 2010. We compute the growth rate of earnings gj (Sj , Sj +1)
using the individual-level information for the years 2008 and 2010. In equations (4) and (5)
we include age and gender covariates.
Tables 4 and 5 present the explanatory variables included in the educational multinomial

19

Each agent in our model selects the schooling level that maximizes his expected utility. We assume that
in forming these expectations he uses all available information. In this way, recent high school graduates should
consider the labor market outcomes of recent college graduates to decide whether or not to continue their education.
This logic justifies our control group in the context of our schooling choice setup. We recognize that the cohort of
recent high school graduates might underestimate the counterfactual labor market outcomes for college graduates,
and overestimate the returns to postsecondary education. But since we find a large fraction of individuals with
negative net returns to postsecondary degrees, our main conclusion is robust to the definition of the control group.
20
We assume zero earnings for months of unemployment or inactivity. We then compute average monthly
earnings using 12 observations per individual. For those individuals with average monthly earnings below the legal
minimum wage divided by 12, we assume zero earnings. We do this to make sure we are considering earnings
coming from at least one month of formal full time employment during the year. The minimum wage was set to
US$ 318 between July 2008 and June 2009 and US$ 344 per month between July 2010 and June 2011.

choice model, the test score measurement system and the labor market outcome equations.
Summary statistics of the variables are presented in table 6.
Estimation. We assume that the distribution of θ, f (θ), can be approximated as a
mixture of two normal distributions with means (µ1 , µ2 ) (with the overall mean of θ restricted
to zero), probabilities (p1 , p2 ), and variances (Σ1 , Σ2 ):

θ ∼ p1 Φ(µ1 , Σ1 ) + p2 Φ(µ2 , Σ2 )

with p1 + p2 = 1. Therefore, we use flexible distributional assumptions to estimate the
distribution of unobserved ability.
The likelihood function of the model is given by the following expression:

L =

Y

f (Yi , Di , Ti |Xi )

i

=

YZ

f (Yi |Di , Xi , θ)f (Di , Ti |Xi , κ)fθ (κ)dθ

i

where Yi is a vector containing individual i’s labor market outcomes (Yi = [yj (Sj ), gj (Sj , Sj +
1)]), Xi contains his observed exogenous characteristics (Xi = [XjV (t), Xjy (t), Xjg (t)]), Di denotes observed schooling choice and Ti contains test scores. We assume that the idiosyncratic
errors in equation (1) are distributed according to independent standardized normal distributions. We follow Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004) and assume that X and θ are
independent. The disturbances in equations (4), (5) and (6) are also assumed to be drawn
from independent normal distributions with mean zero. The associated variances are estimated by our empirical strategy. Given θi and Xi , the distribution of counterfactuals is
identified and all errors in the model are independent from each other.
The empirical implementation follows a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method.21 The model’s estimates are used to simulate 100,000 draws. For each draw, we
predict schooling choices and labor market outcomes for each counterfactual.

4

The Returns to Postsecondary Degrees

We use the model’s estimated parameters to generate the returns to postsecondary degrees
in Chile. Figure 5 presents the estimated distribution of unobserved ability. It confirms
previous findings documenting that unobserved ability might not be normally distributed
(Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006).
Table 7 shows the estimates of our multinomial probit model. Estimated coefficients suggest that students coming from a rich home environment (high-income families and educated
mothers) have a higher probability of obtaining a postsecondary degree, particularly from
Public and Private universities (five-year degrees).
Our results also indicate that an increase in annual tuition reduces the probability of
graduating from Public and PPF universities. In contrast, it increases the likelihood of
choosing TI and PI. Initially, these results might seem counterintuitive. However, one possible
explanation is that tuition costs are interpreted as proxies of quality. In other words, these
costs could contribute to information asymmetries in the postsecondary schooling market if
there is lack of reputational mechanisms identifying institutions that do not provide good
quality services. It implies that individuals who are more likely to choose PI and TI, perceive
a positive relation between provided quality and tuition costs.
Conditional on observed individual characteristics and the costs of postsecondary education, we obtain a positive relationship between unobserved abilities and the probability of
graduating from PI and university (including public and private institutions). In contrast,
estimates show a negative relationship between our measure of unobserved individual ability
and the probability of obtaining a two-year postsecondary degree from a TI. Our results also
indicate heterogeneity among the individuals choosing universities. In particular, we find
that high-ability individuals are more likely to choose PPF compared to public, private and
PI institutions.
Table 8 presents estimates from the test score equations. The coefficients on age and
gender are statistically significant and show the expected signs. In particular, males perform
better in math and geography, while females obtain higher scores in language and have
better grades during high school (measured by GPA). Also, the coefficients associated with
unobserved ability all have positive signs and they all are statistically significant at the 1%

17

level.
Estimates of the equations for labor market outcomes are presented in table 9. Coefficients from initial earning equations (columns 1 to 6) show that unobserved endowments are
positively correlated with initial earnings. The male and age coefficients have positive signs
and are statistically significant at 1% level. The earnings growth estimates are presented in
columns 7 to 12. Here, the age coefficients have negative signs, suggesting, on average, earnings profiles are concave (except for graduates from two-year degrees - TI). Our estimates
suggest that higher ability individuals would have a flatter earnings profile if they chose to
graduate from private universities or not to continue on to any postsecondary studies.
In order to evaluate the goodness of fit our model, we compare the distribution of choices
between the observed data and the model samples. We do this by simulating data from our
estimated parameters. As figure 6 shows the simulated data closely resembles the distribution
of choices. Additionally, we compare average monthly earnings and the associated growth
rates between the observed data and the model simulated sample. Figures 7 and 8 show that
our model mimics the observed patterns in the data despite slightly overestimating growth
rates of earnings.22
Figure 9 presents the variance decomposition of test scores as a function of observables
(gender, age, mother’s education and family income), the individual’s latent ability, and the
error term. For language, math and geography; unobserved ability explains a significant
fraction of the overall variances (between 42.2% and 50.1% depending on the specific test).
The observed regressors and the error terms explain approximately 25% of the variance. In
the case of high school GPA, a significant percentage of the variance is explained by the error
term (58%), 32.9% is explained by the factor, and only a small fraction (9%) is attributed
to observable elements.
It is interesting to compare the simulated sorting profile on the different degrees implied
by the latent ability (θ) and the error-contaminated measurement of θ (PSU scores). This
exercise shed lights on the importance of distinguishing between the two. Figures 10 and 11
present these results. For high-ability individuals both the PSU and θ produce similar sorting.
The highest ability individuals are more likely to choose PPF, Public and Private universities
22

Tables A1-A3 in the appendix compare means, variances and distributions for test scores and labor market
outcomes between the observed data and the model simulated sample.

18

(in that order). Surprisingly, for lower ability individuals θ and PSU scores produce different
sortings. According to the estimated PSU distribution, low-scoring students tend to choose to
not graduate from postsecondary education or to graduate from two-year degrees. However,
if we use the estimated θ distribution, TI and PI graduates tend to have lower latent ability.
This suggests that estimates based only on observable measurements –such as PSU scores–
lead to a different sorting structure than the actual latent factor. Thus, OLS estimates using
PSU as proxies for latent ability, are potentially biased.
Following equation (3), we estimate the average stream of annual earnings ŷj (t) for each
schooling choice j. We compute yearly earnings, for this age range. Figure 12 displays
the conditional earnings profiles, starting at age 18 and ending at 35. There is significant
heterogeneity across alternatives. Moreover, the estimated earnings profiles are not parallel
across the different alternatives. For example, on average, the profile of people with degrees
from private universities has higher initial earnings than one for PI graduates, but this gap
reduces with age.
Treatment Effects. We use the results from our model and administrative data on
tuition costs to compute the individual-level net present value of earnings P Vj for each
degree type j as well as the treatment effects defined in equations (8) and (7). We assume a
constant discount rate of 0.04.
Table 10 presents our estimates for T Tjk (first best versus second best options) and T Tj0
(first best option versus not pursuing a postsecondary degree). The results confirm that,
on average, obtaining a postsecondary degree would lead to net positive economic returns.
For T Tj0 , five-year postsecondary degrees (universities) have the highest returns among all
alternatives, particularly when obtained from PPF universities. Nevertheless, our results also
document the existence of substantial heterogeneity in the returns. Specifically, we find that
the portion of individuals receiving negative returns to their postsecondary degree ranges
from 35% to 42% (third column in table 10).23 Even if we disregard individuals at the
23

We calculate rates of return as:
rj0 = (P Vj − P V0 )/P V0
rjk = (P Vj − P Vk )/P Vk ,

where P V0 and P Vk are defined in the main text. Treatment effects are calculated according to equations (11) and
(12).

19

margin (fourth column), we still find a large number of individuals with negative returns.
These individuals would have been financially better-off not continuing schooling beyond high
school. This might suggest the existence of psychic benefits to postsecondary education. This
is in line with the findings of Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003); Cunha, Heckman, and
Navarro (2005, 2006); Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006). Alternatively, this may be the
result of a lack of information at the time the schooling decisions are made. Although we
do not decompose the treatment effects variance into the these two components, Carneiro,
Hansen, and Heckman (2003) find that uncertainty coming from forecast errors has little
effect on schooling choices. Furthermore, we find that individuals with a higher stock of
unobserved abilities also have higher values of T Tjk (figure 13).
Next, we analyze the results for T Tjk . Estimated returns fall drastically and the portion
of individuals realizing negative economic returns rises considerably. It is interesting to note
that private universities have the highest economic returns. Moreover, as the differences
between the first- and second-best option shrink, T Tjk becomes now lower for PPF than for
private universities.
To understand this result, we look at the distribution of first and second best choices.
Table 11 presents these results. The second best choice distribution follows the rank-order
of economic benefits closely. For individuals choosing TI, the most popular second choice is
not enrolling in a tertiary institution. The distribution of second-best choices for individuals
choosing private universities is roughly uniform across the other alternatives. PPF institutions, on the other hand, the vast majority of second best choices are concentrated in public
universities.24
T Tjk also varies with our measure of latent ability θ. For example, for two-year degrees
(TIs) T Tjk is decreasing in θ (figure 14). This implies that high-skilled individuals graduating
from a TI would have been better-off financially selecting their second best alternative. For
Public universities there is a similar phenomenon: as θ rises, T Tjk decreases because the
second best alternative starts to increase in economic value. For the other postsecondary
degrees (Private, PI and PPF) higher θ produces greater economic benefit according to our
measure T Tjk .
24

In table A.4 we show estimated T Tjk by second choices.

20

Overall, our findings suggest that a substantial fraction of individuals make schooling decisions that lead to negative net economic returns. As explained above, we cannot determine
if these “mistakes” are due to a lack of information or to individual preferences (psychic benefits). We can, however, show that our estimated treatment effects are directly affected by
latent ability. This confirms the important role of unobserved heterogeneity in determining
individual’s expectations and/or psychic costs/benefits.
Policy experiment: The effect of tuition subsidies. We utilize our model to investigate the effects of a reduction in tuition costs on schooling decisions. We follow the analysis
presented in Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003) and simulate the impact of a uniform
reduction in tuition for all institution types. Then, we extend the analysis and simulate a
relative reduction in costs for each postsecondary institution type. This enables us to trace
out the behavioral responses to heterogeneous changes in tuition costs across institutions.
Table 12 shows the distribution of school choices after a 10% reduction in tuition costs
for all institution types.25 Contrary to what we expected, total enrollment in postsecondary
institutions is essentially unaffected by the change (a reduction of only 0.94%). However,
disguised by the stable overall enrollment, we observe significant changes in the composition
of enrollment across degrees and institutions.
Specifically, we observe a reduction in PI enrollment (17,34% - i.e, from 9,158 to 7,570)
and Private enrollment (6,9% - i.e, from 17,940 to 16,700), and an increase in enrollment
for the other institution types. TI, Public and PPF experience an increase in enrollment
of 2.25% (from 5,537 to 5,662), 8.83% (from 13,408 to 14,590) and 12.62% (from 8,028 to
9,041), respectively.
These findings confirm the importance of allowing for heterogeneity across types of higher
education institutions. They also suggest that changes in tuition costs produce no significant effects on overall enrollment, after controlling for family background characteristics and
ability. This suggests that short-term credit constraints might not play a major role in the
Chilean postsecondary education system (at least in terms of the probability of obtaining a
degree).

25

We allow the direct costs differ across different types of institutions, so the 10% reduction modifies the relative
costs. Table 2 presents average values per institution.

Conclusions

In this paper we estimate heterogeneous returns to different types of postsecondary institutions in Chile. We account for observed and unobserved selection across the available
alternatives. Our identification strategy is based on the presence of an unobserved endowment (ability), which generates the correlation between schooling choices and future labor
market outcomes. Our model is capable of producing a variety of treatment effects. Our results demonstrate an important sorting component based on unobserved ability, confirming
the advantages of our approach over more traditional empirical strategies.
Compared to the alternative of graduating from high school and not pursuing a postsecondary degree, on average, all postsecondary degrees have positive economic returns.
However, there is significant heterogeneity in our estimates. We document that a large proportion of students are willing to accept negative monetary returns to postsecondary degrees.
Moreover, we exploit the structure of our schooling choice model and compute a treatment
effect that compares the economic returns to the first-best versus the second-best alternative. In this case we find an even larger fraction of individuals experiencing negative returns.
These findings might be due to either the presence of psychic benefits (Cunha, Heckman,
and Navarro, 2005, 2006) or informational asymmetries.
Finally, we estimate that a reduction in tuition costs produces non-trivial changes in the
composition of postsecondary graduates, but does not affect overall enrollment levels. This
highlights the importance of allowing for heterogeneous returns to postsecondary degrees.
Furthermore, consistent with the results in Cameron and Heckman (2001) and Carneiro and
Heckman (2002), this suggests that financial constraints are not playing a major role in the
Chilean postsecondary education system.

Notes: Sample size 57,159. As described in the text, our sample considers individuals who took
PSU during 2001 and 2005. Due the fact that PSU scores are not comparable across the time, we
use a measure of relative academic performance: percentiles within each year. Also, considering that
PSU scores are used as dependent variable in linear equations we use the following transformation.
Let x denote the PSU percentile. Thus, we use g(x) = ln(x/1 − x). Categories of institution types
are define as: Two-year degrees provided by Technical Institutes (TI), four-year degrees obtained in
Professional Institutes (PI) and five-year degrees from Public Universities (Public), Private universities
receiving public funding (PPF) and Private universities without public funding (Private). Control
Group corresponds to students who took PSU in 2007 but who do not appear in enrollment records
(2008 and 2009). Annual Tuition costs correspond to the annual cost of each one of the institution
types conditional on the alternative chosen by the individuals (in million of chilean pesos).

(b)Let P V0 corresponds to the financial benefits or losses (that is, excluding psychic costs or
benefits) of choosing not enrolling in any postsecondary degree and P Vj the economic net benefits of
choosing degree j ∈ J (see equations 9 and 10). One way of estimating agent’s economic benefits of
postsecondary education is given by:
∆0j = P Vj − P V0
rj0 = (P Vj − P V0 )/P V0
On the other hand, let
j ∗ = argmaxj∈J {Vj }
k ∗ = argmaxk∈J |−j ∗ {Vk }
be the first and second choice, respectively. Then Dk∈J |−j = 1 if k is the first choice in J excluding
j ∗ . Let P Vj and P Vk the corresponding net economic benefits. Therefore, it is possible to define the
following expressions:
∆kj = P Vj − P Vk
rjk = (P Vj − P Vk )/P Vk
Finally, Pr(A) denotes the probability of event A.

Notes: (a) Categories of institution types are define as: Two-year degrees provided by Technical
Institutes (TI), four-year degrees obtained in Professional Institutes (PI) and five-year degrees from
Public Universities (Public), Private with public funding Universities (PPF) and Private without
public funding Universities (Private). (b) Control Group corresponds to those students who took
PSU in 2007 but who do not appear in enrollment records (2008 and 2009). (c) Goodness of fit is
tested using χ2 test where the Null Hypothesis is M odel = Data.
