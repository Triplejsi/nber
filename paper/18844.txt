Conditional Risk Premia in Currency Markets and Other Asset Classes

ABSTRACT
The downside risk CAPM (DR-CAPM) can price the cross section of currency returns. The market-beta
differential between high and low interest rate currencies is higher conditional on bad market returns,
when the market price of risk is also high, than it is conditional on good market returns. Correctly
accounting for this variation is crucial for the empirical performance of the model. The DR-CAPM
can jointly rationalize the cross section of equity, equity index options, commodity, sovereign bond
and currency returns, thus offering a unified risk view of these asset classes. In contrast, popular models
that have been developed for a specific asset class fail to jointly price other asset classes.

1. Introduction
Foreign exchange is a potentially risky investment and the debate on whether currency returns can be explained
by their association with risk factors remains ongoing. We find that the cross section of currency returns can be
explained by a risk model where investors are concerned about downside risk. High yield currencies earn higher
excess returns than low yield currencies because their co-movement with aggregate market returns is stronger
conditional on bad market returns than it is conditional on good market returns. We find that this feature of the
data is characteristic not only of currencies but also of equities, commodities, sovereign bonds and other test assets
thus providing a unified risk view of these markets.
The carry trade in foreign exchange consists of investing in high yield currencies while funding the trade in
low yield currencies. This trading strategy has historically yielded positive returns because returns on high yield
currencies are higher than returns on low yield currencies. A number of explanations for this cross-sectional
dispersion have been advanced in the literature, varying from risk based to behavioral.
We suggest a risk-based explanation by showing that the downside risk capital asset pricing model (DR-CAPM)
prices the cross section of currency returns. We follow Ang, Chen, and Xing [2], who study equity markets, by
allowing both the market price of risk and the beta of currencies with the market to change conditional on the
aggregate market return. Intuitively, the model captures the changes in correlation between the carry trade and
the aggregate market returns: the carry trade is more correlated with the market during market downturns than
it is during upturns.
Correctly capturing the variations in betas and prices of risk is crucial to the empirical performance of the
DR-CAPM. It also clarifies why the unconditional CAPM does not explain the cross section of currency returns.
While high yield currencies have higher betas than lower yield currencies, the difference in betas is too small to
account for the observed spread in currency returns.
We extend our results by testing the performance of the DR-CAPM jointly on currencies, various equity portfolios, equity index options, commodities and sovereign bonds. The variations in betas and prices of risk in the
DR-CAPM can jointly capture the cross-sectional returns of all of these asset classes. This contrasts with the
inability of a number of asset-class-specific models to price asset classes other than the one for which they have
been built.
The economic intuition behind our results is summarized in Figure 1. Across different asset classes such as
currencies, commodities, and equities, assets that have higher exposure to downside risk, that is assets that have
a higher downside beta (β ´ ), earn higher excess returns even when controlling for their CAPM beta (β).4 The
top panel of Figure 1 highlights this pattern in the data by plotting realized average excess returns versus the
corresponding asset loading on downside risk (β ´ ´ β). The positive relationship between expected returns and

downside risk is the crucial pattern behind the more formal econometric analysis of this paper. In contrast, the
bottom panel of Figure 1 shows why the CAPM cannot price the returns of these asset classes. Within each asset
class there is little dispersion in betas but a larger dispersion in realized returns. Across asset classes the CAPM
captures, at best, the average return of each asset class, but no strong systematic relationship appears.
We compare the DR-CAPM with models based on principal component analysis (PCA) both within and across
asset classes. Within each asset class the DR-CAPM captures the cross-sectional dispersion in returns summarized
by the most important principal components. Across asset classes the DR-CAPM continues to capture expected
returns with only two fundamental factors, while a PCA-based model requires as many as eight factors to generate
similar explanatory power.
This paper contributes to two strands of literature: the international finance literature on exchange rates and
currency returns and the asset pricing literature on the joint cross section of returns of multiple asset classes.
Among a vast international finance literature, Lustig and Verdelhan [36] provide an explanation for the cross
section of currency returns based on the Durable Consumption CAPM (DC-CAPM). Burnside [9] and Lustig
and Verdelhan [37] discuss the association of currency returns with consumption growth. Burnside, Eichenbaum,
Kleshchelski, and Rebelo [10], Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo [12, 11], Burnside, Han, Hirshleifer, and Wang
[13] focus on explanations of the carry trade such as investor overconfidence and peso problems. Lustig, Roussanov,
and Verdelhan [35] (LRV) provide a model that employs the principal component analysis of currency returns. They
show that currencies that load more heavily on the first two principal components, approximated by the returns on
a dollar and carry trade portfolio respectively, earn higher excess returns on average. Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling,
and Schrimpf [40] link the carry trade factor to exchange rate volatility.
Our contribution to this literature is to provide an explanation of currency returns based on the conditional
contemporaneous association of currency returns with a traditional risk factor, the market return. We not only reconcile our findings with the more statistical factors used in the literature, but also show that currencies are affected
by the same aggregate risk that drives expected returns in other assets classes such as equities and commodities.
A nascent literature is exploring the joint cross section of returns in multiple asset classes. Cochrane [18]
emphasized this research agenda, which aims to reconcile the discount factors in different asset classes. In his
American Finance Association presidential address he ponders: “What is the factor structure of time-varying
expected returns? Expected returns vary over time. How correlated is such variation across assets and asset
classes? How can we best express that correlation as factor structure? [...] This empirical project has just begun,
[...] but these are the vital questions.”
In recent and ongoing research Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen [3], Frazzini and Pedersen [27], Koijen,
Moskowitz, Pedersen, and Vrugt [32] document that a number of cross-sectional phenomena such as value, carry,
momentum, and the slope of the unconditional-CAPM-based capital market line that were previously only documented for specific asset classes are actually pervasive across multiple asset classes. We contribute to this literature
2

by showing that the DR-CAPM can jointly reconcile the cross-sectional dispersion in returns across multiple asset
classes. We also explore the factor structure by comparing the model to several PCA-based models. We find that
PCA-based models tailored to a specific asset class are unable to price other asset classes, and that a PCA model
based on the joint cross-section of multiple asset classes overestimates the number of risk factors. We view our
results as a step in the research agenda emphasized by Cochrane [18].
We stress that the purpose of this paper is not to suggest that the DR-CAPM is the “true” model of all asset
prices, nor is it to discourage the use of PCA to summarize patterns in asset returns. The purpose of this paper
is to show that the cross sectional variation in returns across asset classes can be captured by the association of
returns, both unconditionally and conditionally, with a traditional risk factor, the market return. For this purpose
and for completeness, we also report in Section 6.5 a number of assets that the the DR-CAPM does not price well.
In a separate online appendix we provide a number of details, robustness checks, and extensions of our results
that are omitted in the main body of the paper, including a comparison of the DR-CAPM with PCA and co-skewness
models.

2. Carry Trade, Cross-Sectional and Market Returns
We follow Ang et al. [2] in allowing a differentiation in unconditional and downside risk. This captures the idea
that assets that have a higher beta with market returns conditional on low realization of the market return are
particularly risky. The economic intuition underlying downside risk is simple: agents not only require a premium for
securities the more their returns covary with the market return, but also, and even more so, when securities covary
more with market returns conditional on low market returns. Markowitz [39] was among the first to recognize the
importance of downside risk, formalized in his “semi-variance”, in addition to his more canonical expected-returnvariance framework.5 While Ang et al. [2] motivate the above insight using the disappointment aversion model
of Gul [29] further extended by Routledge and Zin [44], a variety of models are potentially consistent with our
findings.6
The main insight of this paper is that downside risk is a prevalent feature in many asset classes. We show
that expected returns in currency, equity, commodity, sovereign bond and option markets can be explained by a
simple beta that measures the downside risk of assets in these asset classes. To capture the relative importance of
5 Markowitz [39][Ch. 9] notes that “variance is superior with respect to (computational) cost, (analytical) convenience, and familiarity. (However), analyses based on semi-variance tend to produce better portfolios than those based on variance”.
6 A variety of other asymmetrical CAPM models have been derived, for example: Leland [34] and Harvey and Siddique [30]. Adrian,
Etula, and Muir [1] test a model of financial constraints and leverage in which the discount factor loads on negative outcomes for
broker-dealer firms.

where ri is the log excess return of asset i over the risk-free rate, rm is the log market excess return, βi and βi´
are the unconditional and downside beta defined by an exogenous threshold (δ) for the market return, and λ and
λ´ are the unconditional and downside prices of risk, respectively. This empirical framework is flexible in allowing
variations both in the quantity and the price of risk while maintaining a parsimonious parametrization with a single
threshold δ.
Note that the model reduces to the CAPM in the absence of differential pricing of downside risk from unconditional market risk: λ´ “ 0; or if the downside beta equals the CAPM beta: βi´ “ βi . As in the case of the CAPM,
the model also restricts the unconditional price of risk to equal the expected market excess return:

Errm s “ λ,

(2)

because both the unconditional and downside beta of the market with itself are equal to 1.
To clarify the terminology used in this paper, notice that we employ the concept of conditionality in the context
of contemporaneous realizations of states of the world: market return above or below a threshold. A part of the
asset pricing literature has instead applied similar terminology in the context of time variation of expected returns
and return predictability tests.
We stress that while we do not allow for time variation in the betas or the prices of risk, our empirical methodology is consistent with some predictability in expected returns. Since we test our model on sorted portfolios that
capture a characteristic associated with expected returns, for example the interest rate differential, we allow for
predictability generated by variation over time in this characteristic. Cochrane [17] notes the similarity between
testing the model on sorted portfolios and testing the model on unsorted assets while allowing for time variation
in instruments that proxy for managed portfolios. Our procedure, however, does not allow variation in expected
returns through time for a fixed characteristic.
For example, we capture the fact that the expected return for a specific currency pair varies through time as
the corresponding interest rate differential varies, but we do not allow for the expected return of a specific currency
pair to vary through time given a constant interest rate differential. Lustig et al. [35] similarly allow predictability

4

only through variation in the interest rate differential.7
Finally, our model specification is similar to the one tested by Ang et al. [2] on equity portfolios. While
the present specification has the convenience of both nesting the CAPM and reducing the number of estimated
coefficients in the cross-sectional regression to the price of downside risk λ´ , we report in the appendix the estimates
for the specification in Ang et al. [2] for our benchmark test assets.
2.1. Data
We use the bilateral currency returns dataset in Maggiori [38]; details of the data are included in the online
appendix and in the original reference. The data are monthly, from January 1974 to March 2010, and cover 53
currencies. We follow Lustig and Verdelhan [36] in defining a cross section of currency returns based on their
interest rate. We sort currencies into 6 portfolios, in ascending order of their respective interest rates.
Since the dataset includes currencies for which the corresponding country has undergone periods of extremely
high inflation and consequently high nominal interest rates, we split the sixth portfolio into two baskets: 6A and
6B. Portfolio 6B includes currencies that belong to portfolio 6 and that have annualized inflation at least 10%
higher than US inflation in the same month.8
We also use an alternative sorting that only includes developed countries’ currencies.9 In this case we sort the
currencies into 5 rather than 6 baskets, to take into account the overall reduced number of currencies.
We calculate one-month bilateral log excess returns rt`1 as the sum of the interest differential and the rate of
exchange rate depreciation of each currency with the US dollar:

rt`1 “ i‹t ´ it ´ ∆st`1 ,
where i˚ and i are the foreign and US interest rate, and st is log spot exchange rate expressed in foreign currency
per US dollar.
Figure 2 shows that the sorting produces a monotonic increase in returns from portfolios 1 to 6. Further
descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1. Portfolios 6A and 6B highlight the very different behavior of high
inflation currencies. The standard deviation of returns for portfolio 6B is almost double that of all other baskets.
Bansal and Dahlquist [4] note that the uncovered interest parity condition cannot be rejected for these currencies.
7 It is in principle possible to allow both the concept of conditionality used in this paper and the time variation in betas and prices
of risk to co-exist within the same model. In the present context, this could be achieved by estimating time varying betas and lambdas.
Since this would require extracting additional information from a potentially limited number of observations for the downstate, we
opted to impose constant betas and lambdas through time. While we do not disregard the possibility of time varying parameters, we
view our model choice as conservative given the available data and stress that this restriction is routinely imposed on asset pricing
models especially when testing them on sorted portfolios.
8 We view our results excluding the high inflation currencies as conservative since these noisy observations are eliminated. Our
results are robust to different threshold levels or to the inclusion of all the currencies in the 6th portfolio. The inflation data for all
countries is from the IMF International Financial Statistics.
9 A country is considered developed if it is included in the MSCI World Equity Index.

5

These findings and the general concern about the effective tradability of these currencies during periods of economic
turmoil lead us to present our benchmark results using only basket 6A and to provide robustness checks including
both basket 6 and 6B in the online appendix.
For our benchmark results on the cross section of equity returns we use the six Fama & French portfolios sorted
on size and book-to-market for the period from January 1974 to March 2010. In additional results we also test
our model on the cross section of industry-sorted equity portfolios by Fama & French for the period from January
1974 to March 2010, on the CAPM-beta sorted equity portfolios of Frazzini and Pedersen [27] for the period from
January 1974 to March 2010, and on the equity index option return series by Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Savov
[20] for the period from April 1986 to March 2010.
For the cross section of commodity returns we use five commodity-futures portfolios sorted by the commodity
basis for the period from January 1974 to December 2008 by Yang [46]. For the cross section of sovereign bonds we
use six sovereign-bond portfolios sorted by the probability of default and bond beta for the period from January
1995 to March 2010 by Borri and Verdelhan [6].
For the “market” return we use the value-weighted CRSP US equity market log excess return for the period
January 1974 to March 2010. We use a broad US equity market return as the market return in our benchmark
results not only because it is the most commonly used return to test CAPM-like asset pricing models, but also to
conservatively avoid increasing the covariances between test assets and pricing factors by including our other test
assets, such as currencies and commodities, in our market index. Nonetheless, in robustness checks included in
the appendix we repeat our benchmark analysis using the MSCI World Market Equity Index returns and our own
“market index” built by merging all our test assets in a single index.
Tables 2 and 3 provide summary statistics for the equity, equity index options, commodity futures and sovereign
bond portfolios returns. In Table 2, Panel A highlights the pattern that small and value stocks have higher returns;
Panel B highlights that futures on commodities that have low basis have higher returns; Panel C highlights that
sovereign bonds have higher returns whenever they have lower credit rating and/or higher CAPM betas. In Table 3,
Panel A highlights that equities that have high preformation CAPM-betas tend to earn (somewhat) lower returns;
Panel B creates a cross section by sorting equities on their industry classification; Panels C and D show that
portfolios that are short equity index put options and long call options earn higher returns the further the options
are out of the money and the shorter (longer) the maturity for puts (calls).
2.2. Conditional Correlations
The central insight underlying our work is that the currency carry trade, as well as other cross-sectional strategies, is more highly correlated with aggregate market returns conditional on low aggregate returns than it is
conditional on high aggregate market returns. This insight is supported by a growing empirical literature including
Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen [7], Burnside [8], Lustig and Verdelhan [37], Christiansen, Ranaldo, and Soed-

6

erlind [16], Mueller, Stathopoulos, and Vedolin [42] all of which find a state dependent correlation. In ongoing work,
Caballero and Doyle [14] and Dobrynskaya [22] highlight the strong correlation of the carry trade with market risk
during market downturns. Our paper differs from all previous studies both by providing systematic evidence over a
longer time period and larger sample of this state dependent correlation and by relating the resulting downside risk
to that observed in other asset classes such as equities, equity index options, commodities, and sovereign portfolios.
We define the downstate to be months where the contemporaneous market return is more than one standard deviation below its sample average. A one standard deviation event is a reasonable compromise between a sufficiently
low threshold to trigger concerns about downside risk and a sufficiently high threshold to have a large number of
downstate observations in the sample. Our definition assigns 55 monthly observations to the downstate, out of 435
total observations in our sample. For robustness we test our model with different threshold levels as well as a finer
division of the state space into three rather than two states.10
Table 4 shows that the carry trade is unconditionally positively correlated with market returns. As reported
in the third row of the table, the unconditional correlation is 0.14 and statistically significant for our benchmark
sample of currencies. Most of the unconditional correlation is due to the downstate: conditional on the downstate
the correlation increases to 0.33, while it is only 0.02 in the upstate.11 The table also confirms that this pattern is
robust to the exclusion of emerging markets and to various thresholds of inflation for the basket 6B.
Figure 3 highlights this characteristic of the data by plotting the kernel-smoothed conditional correlation between
the carry trade and the market returns. The top panel shows that the correlation of high yield currencies with
the market returns is a decreasing function of market returns. The opposite is true for low yield currencies in the
middle panel. The bottom panel highlights that our results are not sensitive to the exact choice of threshold.

3. Econometric Model
We estimate the model in (1) with the two-stage procedure of Fama and MacBeth [24]. In our model the first
stage consists of two time-series regressions, one for the entire time series and one for the downstate observations.
These regressions produce point estimates for the unconditional and downstate betas, β̂ and β̂ ´ , which are then
used as explanatory variables in the second stage. The second-stage regression is a cross-sectional regression of the
average return of the assets on their unconditional and downstate betas. In our estimation we restrict, following the
theory section above, the market price of risk to equal the sample average of the market excess-return. Therefore,
in the second-stage regression we estimate a single parameter: the downside price of risk λ´ .
10 Thresholds of the sample average minus 0.5 or 1.5 standard deviations assign 118 observations and 27 observations to the downstate,
respectively.
11 The upstate includes all observations that are not included in the downstate.

Formally, the first-stage regressions are:

whenever rmt ď r̄m ´ σrm ,

(4)

where r̄m and σrm are the sample average and standard deviation of the market excess return, respectively. The
second-stage regression is given by:

r̄i “ β̂i r̄m ` pβ̂i´ ´ β̂i qλ´ ` αi ,

i “ 1, . . . , N ,

(5)

where r̄i and r̄m are the average excess returns of the test assets and the market excess-return respectively, αi are
pricing errors, and N is the number of test assets. Notice that by not including a constant in the second-stage
regression we are imposing that an asset with zero beta with the risk factors has a zero excess return.12
While restricting the model so that the market return is exactly priced reduces the number of coefficients to be
estimated in the cross-sectional regression, it does not imply that the sample average market return is estimated
without noise. The average monthly log excess return of the value-weighted CRSP US equity market for the
sample period from January 1974 to March 2010 is 0.39% with a standard error of 0.23%.13 This corresponds to
an annualized log-excess return for the market of 4.68%, an estimate in the range of the values usually assumed to
calibrate the equity premium. To make clear that the unconditional market price of risk is imposed rather than
estimated in our cross-sectional regressions, we report its estimate with a star and do not report its standard error
in all tables of the paper. While restricting the market to be exactly priced is regarded as a conservative procedure,
we report in the appendix our benchmark results for currencies, commodities and equities without imposing this
restriction and note that in that case we recover an estimate of the price of unconditional market risk of 0.29 that
is similar to the sample average estimate of 0.32.

4. Empirical Results
4.1. Risk Premia: Currency
We find that while the CAPM shows that currency returns are associated with market risk, it cannot explain the
cross section of currency returns because the CAPM beta is not sufficient to explain the cross sectional dispersion
in returns. The left panel of Figure 4 shows that the increase in CAPM beta going from the low yield portfolio
(portfolio 1) to the high yield portfolio (portfolio 6) is small compared to the increase in average returns for these
12 In unreported results we estimated the model including a constant in the cross-sectional regression and verified that the constant
is not statistically significant.
13 When estimating the model on sub-periods, we always impose that the average market return over that sub-period is priced exactly
by correspondingly adjusting the value of λ.

8

portfolios. As it will shortly become evident, once the market price of risk of CAPM is pinned down by the average
market excess return, the CAPM fails to price these currency portfolios.
The middle panel of Figure 4 shows that average currency returns are also strongly related to the downstate
beta. While this finding supports the importance of downside risk for currency returns, it is not per se evidence of
a failure of the CAPM because currencies that have a higher downstate beta do have a higher CAPM beta.
However, the right panel of Figure 4 shows that the relative downstate beta, the difference between downstate
and unconditional beta, is also associated with contemporaneous returns. Currencies that have higher downstate
than unconditional betas are on average riskier and earn higher excess returns. We show in our benchmark
regressions that this state dependency is not fully captured by the CAPM beta.
Figure 5 and Table 5 illustrate both the failure of the CAPM and the performance of the DR-CAPM. The top
panels of Figure 5 present the results employing all currencies, the bottom panels present the results employing
only currencies of developed countries. Since higher yield currencies have higher CAPM betas, they earn a higher
return on average. However, the CAPM beta does not fully capture the risk-return tradeoff: the spread in betas is
too small to account for the spread in currency returns. The failure is evident in the first column of Table 5, where
the CAPM cannot jointly price the market return and the cross section of currency returns producing a R2 of only
9%.14 Correspondingly, the left panels of Figure 5 show that the CAPM predicts almost identical returns for all
currency portfolios.
In contrast, the DR-CAPM explains the cross section of currency returns. In the second column of Table 5, the
DR-CAPM explains 79% of the cross-sectional variation in mean returns even after imposing the restriction that
the market portfolio (included as a test asset) is exactly priced. The right quadrants of Figure 5 correspondingly
show that the test assets lie close to the 45 degree line. The estimated price of downside risk is positive (2.18) and
statistically significant.15 The model fits the returns of portfolios 2 to 6A with small pricing errors. The absolute
pricing error is on average 0.07% (in terms of monthly excess returns) across these portfolios. Portfolio 1, which
contains the low yield currencies, is priced with the biggest pricing error, ´0.2%.16 We also report the χ2 test that
all pricing errors in the cross-sectional regression are jointly zero. While both the CAPM and the DR-CAPM are
formally rejected with p-values of 0% and 0.04% respectively, we stress that the DR-CAPM produces a root mean
square pricing error (RMSPE) that is 40% smaller than that of the CAPM.17
14 We

define the cross-sectional R2 as: R2 ” 1 ´ α̂1 α̂rN V arprqs´1 , where α̂ is the vector of pricing errors, V arprq is the variance of
the vector of test assets mean returns, and N is the number of test assets.
15 The Fama MacBeth procedure does not automatically correct the second-stage regression standard errors for estimated regressors
from the first-stage. Given our separate first-stage regressions for the full sample and the downstate, the Shanken correction (Shanken
[45]) is not immediately applicable here. In the robustness section of this paper and in the appendix, we provide a number of checks
of the standard errors to minimize concerns about their reliability.
16 Note that the pricing errors here and in all subsequent tables and references in the text are expressed in monthly percentage excess
returns, while the figures are annualized percentage excess returns. The pricing errors are defined as the difference between the actual
and model-predicted excess return, so that a positive price error corresponds to an under prediction of the return by the model.
17 The test is under the null hypothesis of zero joint pricing errors, therefore the model is not rejected at the 5% confidence level if
the p-value statistic is higher than 5%.

9

Potential sources of concern about the reliability of our currency returns are sovereign default and international
capital restrictions. To alleviate these concerns, we test the DR-CAPM on a subsample of developed countries’
currencies. The results for this subsample of countries are also reported in Figure 5 and Table 5 and show that
the model performs equally well on these portfolios. The price of downside risk is 2.34 and is consistent with the
2.18 estimate obtained on the full sample. The R2 increases to 85%. We confirm on this subsample the pattern of
small DR-CAPM pricing errors for all portfolios except portfolio 1. The null hypothesis of zero joint pricing errors
cannot be rejected at the 5% confidence level with a p-value of the χ2 test of 8%. The RMSPE of 0.07 is more
than 50% smaller than the one produced by the CAPM on the same test assets.
4.2. Risk Premia: Other Asset Classes
The conditional association of asset returns and the market portfolio and the variation in prices of risk is not
unique to currencies and is, in fact, shared by other asset classes. Providing a unified risk-based treatment of
expected returns across asset classes is both informative from a theoretical perspective and an important check of
the empirical performance of theoretical models.
Figure 6 shows that equity, commodity, and sovereign bond portfolios’ expected returns are positively related to
these assets’ relative downside betas. In all three asset classes, assets that are more strongly associated with market
returns conditional on the downstate than unconditionally have higher average excess returns. This conditional
variation – which is not captured by the CAPM – is the central mechanism that underlies the performance of the
DR-CAPM across asset classes.
We investigate next whether the DR-CAPM can jointly explain the cross section of currency and equity returns.
We add the six Fama & French portfolios sorted on book-to-market and size to the currency and market portfolios
as test assets. Figure 7 and Table 5 show that the DR-CAPM jointly explains these returns. The last column in
Table 5 shows that the estimated price of downside risk is consistent across asset classes but the estimate of 1.41 is
lower than that obtained on currencies alone (2.18).18 The model explains 71% of the observed variation in mean
returns, a noticeable increase over the 24% explained by the CAPM. Figure 7 shows that the largest pricing errors
occur for the small-growth equity portfolio (portfolio 7) in addition to the low-yield currency portfolio (portfolio
1). The average absolute pricing error on all other portfolios is 0.08%, while the pricing errors on the small-growth
equity portfolio and the low-yield currency portfolios are -0.2% and -0.47%, respectively. Section 6.6.2 provides
further details about the pricing of the small-growth equity portfolio. Both the CAPM and the DR-CAPM are
statistically rejected with p-values of the χ2 test of 0%, but the DR-CAPM produces a RMSPE 40% smaller than
the CAPM.
A close analog to the currency carry trade is the basis trade in commodity markets. The basis is the difference
18 If

the small-growth equity portfolio is excluded as a test asset, the estimated price of risk increases to 1.70.

between the futures price and the spot price of a commodity. Among others, Yang [46] shows that commodities
with a lower basis earn higher expected returns (see Table 2 Panel B).19 We extend our results by adding the
commodity portfolios to the currency and equity portfolios. Figure 8 and Table 6 show that the same economic
phenomenon, the conditional variation of the quantity and price of market risk, underlies the variation in expected
returns in commodity markets. The fourth column in Table 6 shows that the estimated price of downside risk
(1.40) is essentially unchanged after the addition of the commodity portfolios to the currency and equity portfolios
studied above and is statistically significant. The model explains 74% of the cross sectional variation in returns
across these asset classes compared to a R2 of -17% for the CAPM. The biggest pricing error occurs for the
high-basis commodity portfolio (portfolio 11) in addition to the low-yield currency portfolio (portfolio 1) and the
small-growth equity portfolio (portfolio 12). The pricing errors for these three portfolios are -0.24%, -0.22%, and
-0.46%, respectively. The average absolute pricing error of all other portfolios included as test assets is 0.07%.
While both the CAPM and the DR-CAPM are again statistically rejected, the DR-CAPM produces a RMSPE
50% smaller than the CAPM.
We investigate next whether sovereign bonds are priced by the DR-CAPM. We use the cross-sectional sorting
of sovereign bonds according to default probability and market beta in Borri and Verdelhan [6]. Figure 9 and
Table 7 confirm yet again the ability of the DR-CAPM to price multiple asset classes. An important caveat in this
case is that the data of Borri and Verdelhan [6] are only available over a relatively short sample period (January
1995 to March 2010), thus limiting the number of observations, particularly for our downstate. The shorter sample
produces noisier estimates of the prices of risk and different point estimates overall from our full sample. The sample
limitations impose caution in interpreting the positive performance of our model on sovereign bonds. Consequently,
we exclude these portfolios from the analysis in the rest of the paper.
In our benchmark results for equity markets we employ the Fama & French book-to-market and size sorted
portfolios because they are among the most commonly tested equity cross sections. In addition, we document here
that the DR-CAPM can rationalize a number of other important cross sections in equity markets: the CAPM-beta
sorted cross section, the industry sorted cross section, and the equity index options cross section.
In Figure 10 and Table 7 we analyze the performance of the DR-CAPM for the cross section of CAPM-beta
sorted equity portfolios of Frazzini and Pedersen [27] as well as for their “Betting Against Beta” (BAB) factor
for equity markets.20 The DR-CAPM has higher explanatory power than the CAPM for the joint cross section of
currency, commodity and beta-sorted equity returns with estimates of the market price of downside risk consistent
with those estimated on other cross sections. Notably the BAB factor has a 1.03% pricing error under the CAPM
that is almost seven times bigger than the 0.15% pricing error under the DR-CAPM.

BAB factor is built via a long position in low beta equities and a corresponding short position in high beta equities. See
original reference for details.
20 The

11

We have documented that for the cross-section of currencies, commodities and Fama & French portfolios the
CAPM under-predicts the returns and the downside risk factor is able to fill the gap between the CAPM predicted
returns and the actual returns in the data. Interestingly, for the beta-sorted portfolios CAPM over-predicts the
returns of the high-beta portfolios with respect to the low beta portfolios; a fact that Frazzini and Pedersen [27]
refer to as a “too flat” Capital Market Line in the data. The DR-CAPM in part corrects the over-prediction of the
CAPM because high-beta equities have a relatively lower downside risk exposure compared to low-beta equities.
For example, consider the BAB factor in the top panels of Figure 10: by construction it has a CAPM beta close
to zero, estimated at -0.05 and not statistically significant, and its riskiness is entirely captured by its downside
beta, estimated at 0.48 and statistically significant (see Panel A Table 10).21 Therefore, for the BAB portfolio the
CAPM implies an annualized expected excess return of -0.19%, while the DR-CAPM predicts a return of 10.3%
which is substantially closer to the actual average return of 12.13%.22 This result is consistent with the analysis
in Frazzini and Pedersen [27] who note that the BAB factor performs particularly poorly when the overall market
return is low, thus naturally generating a downside risk exposure.
In Figure 11 and Table 7 we test the DR-CAPM on the industry-sorted equity portfolios of Fama & French
jointly with the currency and commodity portfolios. We consistently find that the DR-CAPM can rationalize these
test assets with a price of downside risk, here estimated at 1.36, similar to that estimated on other cross-sections.
The last column in Table 7 shows that the model explains 75% of the joint variation in returns of currencies and
equity industry portfolios with a substantial increase over the -32% explained by the CAPM.
Finally, we investigate whether the DR-CAPM can rationalize option returns. Options, and in particular
portfolios short in put options written on the market index, are naturally exposed to downside risk. We test the
model on the cross-section of equity index (S&P 500) option returns in Constantinides et al. [20].23 Figure 12
and Table 8 present the results based on the cross-section of call and put options. The second column in Table 8
shows that the DR-CAPM not only captures 81% of the variation in expected returns across option portfolios, but
can also jointly rationalize this variation together with the returns of currencies and commodities (R2 of 74%, see
column four of the same table). This further confirms that the estimated value of the price of downside risk (λ´ )
is consistent across asset classes even when considering optionality features.
In contrast, the CAPM cannot rationalize option returns. By construction the option portfolios have a CAPM
beta close to 1 (see Panels C-D Table 10), thus generating almost identical CAPM-predicted returns for all portfolios,
but have substantial variation in realized average excess returns (close to a 25% range).24 Almost all option
21 Frazzini

and Pedersen [27] build the BAB factor to have zero CAPM beta. Small differences in the beta occur here because of the
use of a different index to proxy for the CAPM market portfolio as well as a different time period.
22 The CAPM prediction is obtained by multiplying the beta times the market price of risk (-0.05*0.32*12=-0.19). Similarly the
DR-CAPM prediction is obtained by summing to the CAPM prediction the downside risk correction of pβ ´ ´ βqλ´ ˚ 12 “ p0.48 `
0.05q1.65 ˚ 12 “ 10.49.
23 The cross section includes 18 portfolios of calls (9) and puts (9) sorted on maturity and in-the-moneyness. See original source for
portfolio construction details.
24 Recall that Constantinides et al. [20] build the option portfolios by imposing that under the Black and Scholes assumptions they

12

portfolios are accurately priced with small pricing errors with the exception of the 30-day maturity and 90%
moneyness put portfolio.25 Constantinides et al. [20] report that this portfolio is hard to price even for most
option-market-tailored asset pricing models and consider the possibility that liquidity issues might affect its pricing.
We have shown that the DR-CAPM can rationalize a number of important asset classes and that the estimate
of the price of risk remains stable across different estimations. While this reduces concerns about the reliability of
estimates of λ´ , further quantitative implications of our empirical framework, for example about the magnitude
of λ´ , cannot be drawn without imposing a more structural theory on the model. We leave the development of a
structural theory to future work and only note here that λ´ is consistently estimated across a number of different
cross sections, asset classes and patterns in expected returns.26

5. Robustness
An important verification of our results is to confirm the association of currency returns with downside market
risk. In Panel A of Table 9 we provide the first-stage estimates of the unconditional CAPM betas and the downstate
betas for the six currency portfolios. The CAPM betas are increasing from portfolio 1 to 6 and the spread in betas
between the first and last portfolio is statistically different from zero. The increase in betas, however, is small;
the beta of the first portfolio is 0.03 while the beta of the last portfolio is 0.11. The downstate betas highlight
the central mechanism of the DR-CAPM: conditional on below-threshold market returns, high yield currencies
(portfolio 6A) are more strongly related to market risk than low yield currencies (portfolio 1). In fact, we find that
while the downside beta of portfolio 6A (0.30) is larger than its unconditional beta (0.11), the opposite is true for
portfolio 1 with a downside beta of 0.02 and an unconditional beta of 0.03.
Splitting the sample into the downstate picks up the conditional variation in currencies’ association with market
risk, but also reduces the variation available in each subsample to estimate the betas. Therefore, the standard errors
of the first-stage regressions that estimate downstate betas are wider than those of the corresponding regressions
for unconditional betas. We perform a number of robustness checks of our first-stage estimates and their impact
on the second-stage estimates.
We perform two bootstrap tests to check the robustness of the main driver of our results: the different conditional
association of high yield and low yield currencies with the market excess-return. We first test whether high yield
currencies are more associated with market risk than low yield currencies conditional on the downstate under the
´
null hypothesis that β6A
´ β1´ “ 0. We then test whether the different loading on risk of high and low yield

would have a CAPM beta of 1 with the S&P 500 index. The variation in CAPM betas reported here with respect to the original source
is due to the use of the value-weighted CRSP as a market index as well as a different time period for the sample.
25 This is the shortest maturity and furthest out of the money portfolio in the sample.
26 Ultimately, the quantitative importance of downside risk can also be linked to the rare disasters model of Barro [5]. Farhi and
Gabaix [26] develop a model of exchange rates in the presence of rare disasters and Farhi, Fraiberger, Gabaix, Ranciere, and Verdelhan
[25] and [31] evaluate rare disasters in currency markets in an option framework.

13

´
currencies varies across states under the null hypothesis that pβ6A
´ β1´ q ´ pβ6A ´ β1 q “ 0. Figure 14 shows that

both nulls are strongly rejected with p-values of 0.26% and 2.47%, respectively, thus yielding statistical support for
our main economic mechanism.
A second robustness check is to mitigate the concern that our second-stage regression employs potentially weak
estimated regressors from the first stage. Panel B in Table 9 reports the first-stage estimates for the six Fama &
French equity portfolios. Since these equity portfolios have a strong association with the overall equity market, the
betas are very precisely estimated even for the downstate. We then use the prices of risk estimated using only these
equity portfolios to fit the cross section of currencies. Table 11 reports in the first two columns that the DR-CAPM
can still explain 67% of the observed variation in currency returns and 71% of the variation in currency and equity
returns. The estimated price of downside risk is 1.27, statistically significant, and consistent with the estimate of
1.41 obtained on the joint sample of currencies and equities.27
In the middle two columns of Table 11 we verify that our results are not altered by reasonable variations in
the threshold for the downstate. We vary our benchmark threshold for the market return of 1 standard deviation
below its sample mean to 0.5 and 1.5 standard deviations. In both cases we observe a consistent performance of
the model.
Finally, we verify the sensitivity of our results to different thresholds for excluding currencies with high inflation.
We vary the inflation threshold from our benchmark of 10% above the annualized inflation of the US to 5% and
15%. The last two columns of Table 11 show that the lower threshold produces higher but noisier estimates of the
price of risk compared to the higher threshold. In both cases, however, the prices of risk are statistically significant
and the R2 are around 80%.
Further robustness checks are provided in the online appendix. We verify that our results are robust to: using
only developed countries’ currencies, winsorizing the data, varying the inflation threshold for the last currency
portfolios, not imposing the restriction that the market return be exactly priced in sample, alternative measures of
the market index, estimating the model on a longer sample (and relative subsamples) for equity markets, and to
using the model specification in Ang et al. [2].

6. Factor Structure and PCA Based Models
To further investigate the common factor structure in the joint cross-section of currencies, equities, and commodities we perform a principal component analysis (PCA) both on each asset class separately and on their joint
returns. This analysis allows us to compare the DR-CAPM to the asset class-specific PCA-based models that are
prevalent in the literature.
27 This robustness check also minimizes concerns about the reliability of second-stage Fama-MacBeth standard errors due to the
presence of estimated regressors. Our results are little changed when employing first stage estimates that are very accurate.

14

6.1. Currency PCA Model
For currencies, the PCA analysis leads to the model of Lustig et al. [35]. Consistent with their work, we report
in Panel A of Table 12 that the first two principal components account for 87% of the time series variation of
the interest-rate-sorted currency portfolios. The loadings of the first principal component reveal that it can be
interpreted as a level factor because it loads on the returns of all currency portfolios similarly. Analogously, the
loadings of the second principal component reveal that it can be interpreted as a slope factor because it loads on
the differential return when going from portfolio 1 to portfolio 6A. Intuitively, these two principal components can
be approximated by two portfolios: an equally weighted portfolio of all currencies in the sample against the dollar
and a carry trade portfolio created by a long position in portfolio 6 and a short position in portfolio 1. We refer to
these two portfolios as the dollar and carry portfolios, and denote their returns by RXcur and HMLcur respectively.
To confirm the intuition, Table 13 reports in the top left panel that the correlation between the first principal
component and the dollar portfolio is 100% and the correlation between the second principal component and the
carry portfolio is 95%.
Table 14 presents the estimates of both the PCA-based linear model of Lustig et al. [35] and the DR-CAPM
on the cross-section of currency returns. The LRV model explains 64% of the cross sectional variation in currency
returns. The estimated price of risk is statistically significant for the carry portfolio but not for the dollar portfolio.
The model is statistically rejected by the χ2 test on the pricing errors with a p-value of 0%. Notice that it is the
slope factor, the carry portfolio, that carries most of the information relevant for the cross section. A model that
only includes the first principal component, the level factor or dollar portfolio, generates a R2 of only 4%. Similarly
to the DR-CAPM, the largest individual pricing error (-0.2%) for the LRV model is for the low-yield currency
portfolio (portfolio 1).
The DR-CAPM captures the information contained in the principal components that is relevant for this cross
section. Intuitively, the DR-CAPM summarizes the two principal components because the unconditional market
return acts as a level factor while downside risk acts as a slope factor. To confirm this intuition, recall from
Table 9 Panel A that the unconditional market betas are relatively similar across currency portfolios, so that all
portfolios load similarly on the market. In contrast, the downside betas are more strongly increasing going from
portfolio 1 to portfolio 6, thus providing a slope factor. The top two panels in Table 13 confirm that the second
principal component (or the carry portfolio) is more highly correlated with the market portfolio in downstates (28%
correlation), thus loading on downside risk, than it is unconditionally (9% correlation). The DR-CAPM produces
a R2 of 73% and RMSPE of 0.10 that are similar to the R2 of 64% and RMSPE of 0.12 of the LRV model.
6.2. Equity PCA model
The PCA on the cross-section of equities provided by the six Fama & French portfolios sorted on size and bookto-market leads to the three factor model of Fama and French [23]. Panel B in Table 12 shows that the first three
15

principal components account for 98% of the time series variation of the size and book-to-market sorted portfolios.
The loadings of the first principal component reveal that it can be interpreted as a level factor because it loads
on the returns of all equity portfolios similarly. The loadings of the second and third principal components reveal
that they can be interpreted as two slope factors. The second principal component mainly loads on the differential
return when going from small portfolios (1 to 3) to big portfolios (4 to 6). The third principal component mainly
loads on the differential return when going from growth portfolios (1 and 4) to value portfolios (3 and 6). However,
notice that the interpretation is not as clear as it is for currencies (nor as it is for commodities below). For example,
the third principal component does not affect portfolio 2 and 5 in a way consistent with its interpretation as a
factor affecting the value-growth trade-off in returns.
We approximate the first principal component with the market return and the next two principal components
by the Fama & French factors: the small-minus-big portfolio and the high-minus-low portfolio. We denote the
returns of these two portfolios as SMB and HMLf f , respectively. Table 13 shows in the middle left panel that the
first principal component is highly correlated with the market (95% correlation), the second principal component
is mainly related to the SMB return (80% correlation), and the third principal component is mainly related to
the HMLf f return (82% correlation). However, HMLf f and SMB returns are themselves correlated and therefore
do not correspond exactly to the two principal components that are by construction orthogonal to each other.
Correspondingly, we find that HMLf f is also correlated with the second principal component and SMB is correlated
with the third principal component.28
Table 15 presents the estimates of both the PCA-based linear model of Fama and French [23] and the DRCAPM on the cross section of equity returns. The Fama & French three factor model explains 68% of the cross
sectional variation in returns. The estimated prices of risk are significant for the market and HMLf f but not for
SMB. The model is statistically rejected by the χ2 test on the joint pricing errors with a p-value of 0%. Notice that
the cross-sectional performance of the model is driven by the third principal component, which is approximated by
the HMLf f factor. A model based only on the first two principal components generates a R2 of ´4%.
The DR-CAPM is unable to match the small-growth equity returns of portfolio 1 (pricing error of -0.45%) and
therefore produces a lower R2 (33%) than the Fama & French three-factor model. As noted by Campbell and
Vuolteenaho [15], it is typical in the literature to find that models cannot correctly price portfolio 1 and a number
of papers (Lamont and Thaler [33], D’Avolio [21], Mitchell, Pulvino, and Stafford [41]) have questioned whether its
return is correctly measured.29 In the last column of Table 15 we show that once we remove portfolio 1 from the
28 The correlation between HML
f f and SMB helps to rationalize why the interpretation of the equity principal components in terms
of mimicking portfolios is not as clear as it is for currencies or commodities. In the case of currencies and, as will shortly be illustrated,
in the case of commodities, the proxy portfolios of the two principal components are themselves almost uncorrelated. For example, the
correlation between RXcur and HMLcur is only 0.07.
29 Note that these papers refer to portfolio 1 as the small-growth portfolio in the 25-portfolio sorting of Fama & French, while our
first portfolio is the small-growth portfolio in the 6-portfolio sorting of Fama & French. Our first portfolio, therefore, includes more
securities than those considered troublesome in the cited papers. In the appendix, however, we verify that the DR-CAPM mispricing
of the first portfolio in our setting is due to the securities that are part of the smallest growth portfolios in the 25-portfolio sorting.

16

six Fama & French portfolios the DR-CAPM performance improves: the R2 increases to 90% and the hypothesis
of zero joint pricing errors cannot be rejected by the χ2 test at the 5% confidence level.
6.3. Commodity PCA model
The PCA on the cross-section of commodities leads to the model of Yang [46]. Consistent with his work, we
report in Panel C in Table 12 that the first two principal components account for 75% of the time series variation
of the basis-sorted commodity portfolios. The loadings of the first principal component reveal that it can be
interpreted as a level factor because it loads on the returns of all commodity portfolios similarly. Analogously, the
loadings of the second principal component reveal that it can be interpreted as a slope factor because it loads on
the differential return when going from portfolio 1 to portfolio 5. Intuitively, these two principal components can
be approximated by two portfolios: an equally weighted portfolio of all commodities contained in the sample and a
basis trade portfolio created by a long position in portfolio 1 and a short position in portfolio 5. We refer to these
two portfolios as the commodity and basis portfolios and denote their returns by RXcom and HMLcom , respectively.
To confirm this intuition, the bottom left panel of Table 13 shows that the correlation between the first principal
component and the commodity portfolio is 100% and the correlation between the second principal component and
the basis portfolio is 95%.
Table 16 presents the estimates of both the PCA-based linear model of Yang [46] and the DR-CAPM on the
cross-section of currency returns. The Yang model explains 87% of the cross sectional variation in expected returns.
The estimated price of risk is statistically significant for both the commodity and basis portfolios. The hypothesis
of zero joint pricing errors cannot be rejected by the χ2 test with a p-value of 50%. Notice that it is the slope
factor, the basis portfolio, that carries most of the information relevant for the cross section. A model that only
includes the first principal component, the level factor or commodity portfolio, generates a R2 of only 10%.
The DR-CAPM captures the information contained in the principal components that is relevant for this cross
section. Intuitively, the DR-CAPM summarizes the two principal components because the unconditional market
return acts as a level factor, while downside risk acts as a slope factor. To confirm this intuition, recall from
Table 9 Panel C that the unconditional market betas are similar across commodity portfolios, so that all portfolios
load similarly on the market, while the downside betas are decreasing when going from portfolio 1 to portfolio 5,
thus providing a slope factor.30 The bottom two panels in Table 13 confirm that the second principal component
(or the basis portfolio) is more highly correlated with the market portfolio in down states (19% correlation), thus
loading on downside risk, than it is unconditionally (´5% correlation). The DR-CAPM produces a R2 of 82% and
RMSPE of 0.12 that are similar to the R2 of 87% and RMSPE of 0.10 of the Yang model. The hypothesis that the
DR-CAPM pricing errors are jointly zero cannot be rejected by the χ2 test with a p-value of 66%.
Our results, therefore are consistent with the previous evidence on small-growth stocks.
30 Notice that for commodity portfolios the unconditional betas are almost increasing when going from portfolio 1 to portfolio 5, but
the effect is quantitatively small and dominated by the more strongly decreasing downside betas.

17

Having investigated the factor structure of each asset class separately, we conclude that for each asset class the
DR-CAPM has similar explanatory power to the PCA-model that is specifically designed for that asset class.31 We
emphasize that the underlying reason is that in each asset class the factor structure is composed of level and slope
factors that the DR-CAPM picks up with the market and downside risk factors, respectively.
6.4. PCA models across asset classes
We now turn to investigate the factor structure of the joint cross section of currencies, equities, and commodities.
Figure 15 plots together the loadings of the principal component analysis performed on each asset class separately.
The left panel suggests that the first principal component in each asset class represents a joint level factor. The
right panel shows that the subsequent principal components of each asset class are common slope components.
Tables 17 and 18 explore the predictive power of the PCA-based models analyzed above and the DR-CAPM
across asset classes. Table 17 estimates the models using the proxy portfolios, while Table 18 employs directly the
principal components. Each of the asset-class-specific models is unable to price the joint cross section. Both the
LRV model and the Yang model have negative R2 (-15% and -35%, respectively) and the Fama & French model has
a modest R2 of 35%. The LRV model estimates a significant price of risk for the carry portfolio and the estimate
increases to 0.99 from the 0.47 estimate obtained when using only currency portfolios as test assets. The price of
risk of the dollar portfolio remains statistically insignificant. The Yang model estimates a significant price of risk
for the commodity portfolio but not for the basis portfolio. The Fama & French model estimates a significant price
of risk only for the HMLf f portfolio. The point estimates for the prices of risk of the market, SMB, and HMLf f
portfolios are 0.28, 0.23, and 0.57, respectively; these point estimates are overall comparable to the 0.36, 0.19,
and 0.49 estimates obtained when using only the equity portfolios as test assets. The failure of asset-class specific
models to price other asset classes has induced a search for segmented theoretical models that could explain why
different stochastic discount factors are needed to price different asset classes. We view our DR-CAPM results as
suggesting that a unified view of risk markets is still possible.
To obtain an explanatory power similar to the DR-CAPM, the PCA analysis suggests using between four and
eight principal components.32 A naive approach that simply adds principal components leads to using the first
eight principal components. The first two columns in Table 18 show that the resulting model must be discarded as
many of the estimated prices of risk are not statistically significant.
A better model can be built using the information gleaned from the factor structure of each asset class. Since
most of the explanatory power for the cross-section of each asset class comes from a slope factor, it is intuitive to
suggest a model that only includes the slope factors of each asset class and a common level factor. The third and
31 With

the exception of the small-growth equity portfolio.
refer here to the principal components obtained by performing the PCA on the joint returns of currencies, equities, and
commodities. Details of this PCA are reported in the appendix.
32 We

18

second to last columns in Tables 17 and 18 show that a model that uses the first and third principal components of
the equity portfolios, the second principal component of the currency portfolios and the second principal component
of the commodity portfolios or, alternatively, their mimicking portfolios (i.e. the market, HMLf f , carry and basis
portfolios) performs similarly to the DR-CAPM. The estimated prices of risk are statistically significant for all slope
component, or for their mimicking portfolios, but not for the level component or market return. This PCA-based
model generates a R2 of 59% and RMSPE of 0.19 when using the principal components and a R2 of 70% and
RMSPE of 0.16 when using the mimicking portfolios. The DR-CAPM performs similarly with a R2 of 74% and
RMSPE of 0.15 and is once again able to jointly summarize the information contained in all of these principal
components in just two factors.
6.5. Other Factor Structures and Further Research
While the DR-CAPM is able to price returns in many important asset classes, it is not universally successful.
In this section we present results for asset classes for which the DR-CAPM is not successful: momentum portfolios,
corporate bonds and US Treasuries. Rather than estimating the full model, we plot the relationship of the downside
risk beta with average returns in the bottom panels of Figure 16, while the top panels show the relationship of
average returns with the standard CAPM beta.
The left panels of Figure 16 show results for equity portfolios sorted on momentum.33 While the returns of
these portfolios appear to be unrelated to beta, they are broadly positively associated with downside beta with the
exception of the first momentum portfolio, which consists of small firms with very low recent returns. However,
the association with downside beta is not sufficiently strong for the DR-CAPM to fully capture the returns of the
momentum portfolios.
The middle panel shows results for US corporate bonds.34 While the CAPM beta and the downside beta are
both positively associated with these portfolio returns, the spread in average returns is too small compared to the
spread in downside betas.
The right panels in Figure 16 show that the DR-CAPM performs worst on returns of US Treasuries of various
maturities.35 While bond returns are positively associated with their unconditional beta, they are actually negatively related to their downside beta. Cochrane and Piazzesi [19] have documented that the cross section of average
bond returns is in fact driven by a single factor that is not strongly associated with market returns. Figure 16
shows that the bond factor is also not driven by downside market risk.
33 We use six US equity portfolios sorted on size and momentum by Fama & French and available on Ken French’s website. The
sample period is from January 1974 to March 2010.
34 We use the monthly returns on the five corporate bond portfolios sorted annually on their credit spread by Nozawa [43]. The
sample period is from October 1975 to March 2010. Portfolio 1 is composed of the lowest credit spread bonds, portfolio 5 is composed
of the highest credit spread bonds. The 5 portfolios are obtained by equally weighting the 10 portfolios in the benchmark analysis of
Nozawa [43] into five baskets.
35 We use the monthly bond returns in the Fama bond file of CRSP. The sample period is from January 1974 to March 2010.
Portfolios 1-5 are formed with bonds with maturities less than or equal to one to five years, respectively. Portfolio 6 is formed with
bonds with maturities less or equal than 10 years and portfolio 7 with bonds with maturities greater than 10 years.

19

Finally, we stress once more that our purpose was not to test a specific theoretical framework in the data, but
to document a novel pattern, the exposure to downside risk, across many asset classes. Consequently, the model
presented in Section 2 should not be regarded as a formal asset pricing model, but as an approximate reduced
model form for asset returns that is convenient to highlight the novel risk exposure in the data. We are aware
that the return data-generating-process, by the nature of its approximate form, will by construction misprice some
assets whose payoffs are connected with the threshold property. Similarly, we have been intentionally silent on the
deeper foundations of downside risk. It remains an open question for future research to derive models capable of
matching the strong empirical patterns highlighted in this paper as well as providing a structural interpretation to
the risk factors.

7. Conclusion
We find that currency returns are associated with aggregate market risk, thus supporting a risk-based view
of exchange rates. However, we find that the unconditional CAPM cannot explain the cross section of currency
returns because the spread in currency beta is not sufficiently large to match the cross sectional variation in expected
returns. The downside risk CAPM (DR-CAPM) explains currency returns because the difference in beta between
high and low yield currencies is higher conditional on bad market returns, when the market price of risk is also
high, than it is unconditionally.
We also find that the DR-CAPM can jointly explain the cross section of currencies, equity, equity index options,
commodities and sovereign bond returns. We view these results as not only confirming the empirical performance
of the model but also as a first step in reconciling discount factors across asset classes. The performance of the
model across asset classes contrasts with the failure of models designed for a specific asset class in pricing other
asset classes.
Our results open new avenues for future research. Given its demonstrated empirical relevance, it is important
to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of the sources and time variation of downside risk. It remains an open
question whether downside risk comes from preferences or from micro-founded constraints.

number of observations T and the cross sectional R2 s for the unconditional CAPM and the downside risk CAPM (DR-CAPM). In the left two columns, test assets are six
currency portfolios, monthly re-sampled based on the interest rate differential with the US, five commodity futures portfolios, monthly re-sampled based on basis as well as
a betting against beta (BAB) factor. High inflation countries in the last currency portfolio are excluded. A country is considered to have high inflation if it has annualized
monthly inflation 10% higher than US inflation. The next two columns use five portfolios sorted on CAPM beta instead of the BAB factor. The rightmost two columns add
the five Fama & French industry portfolios to the currency and commodity portfolios. The market excess-return is included as a test asset. The sample period is January
1974 to December 2008 for a total of 420 observations. Starred estimates impose the restriction that the market excess-return is exactly priced and consequently no standard
errors are reported.

Prices of risk, Fama&MacBeth standard errors in parentheses, root mean squared pricing errors (RMSPE), the number of observations T and the cross sectional R2 s for
the downside risk CAPM (DR-CAPM). Test assets are six currency portfolios, monthly re-sampled based on the interest rate differential with the US, and the six Fama &
French portfolios, sorted on size and book-to-market where indicated. High inflation countries in the last currency portfolio are excluded. A country is considered to have
high inflation if it has annualized monthly inflation 10% higher than US inflation. In the left two columns, market prices of risk are estimated based only on the six Fama &
French portfolios and the market excess-return. The reported standard errors correspond to this estimation. The estimated prices of risk are then used to fit the six currency
portfolios or the six currency portfolios and the Fama & French portfolios jointly. The next two columns vary the downstate cutoff. Downstate in the low (high) threshold
specification are all months in which the market returns is more than 1.5 (0.5) standard deviations below its sample mean. The rightmost two columns vary the inflation
cutoff. A country is considered to have high inflation if is has annualized monthly inflation 5% (15%) higher than US inflation. The market excess-return is included as
a test asset. The sample period is January 1974 to March 2010 for a total of 435 observations. Starred estimates impose the restriction that the market excess-return is
exactly priced and consequently no standard errors are reported.

Table 17: Estimation of Linear Pricing Models: Currencies, Equities, and Commodities (Mimicking Portfolios)
Prices of risk, Fama&MacBeth standard errors in parentheses, χ2 statistics testing for joint significance of pricing
errors, root mean squared pricing errors (RMSPE), the number of observations T and the cross sectional R2 s for
various factor models and the downside risk CAPM (DR-CAPM). The leftmost column presents the model based on
the dollar and carry portfolio returns of Lustig and Verdelhan [36] (RXcur and HMLcur ). The second column presents
the model based on the commodity and basis portfolio returns of Yang [46] (RXcom and HMLcom ). The third column
presents a model based on the three Fama-French factors (Mrkt, SMB and HML ff ). The next two columns present
models based on combinations of the portfolio returns in the previous three columns. Test assets are six currency
portfolios, monthly re-sampled based on the interest rate differential with the US, the six Fama & French portfolios
sorted on size and book-to-market and five commodity futures portfolios, monthly re-sampled based on basis. The sample
period is January 1974 to December 2008 for a total of 420 observations. Starred estimates impose the restriction that
the market excess-return is exactly priced and consequently no standard errors are reported.

Table 18: Estimation of Linear Pricing Models: Currencies, Equities, and Commodities
Prices of risk, Fama&MacBeth standard errors in parentheses, χ2 statistics testing for joint significance of pricing
errors, root mean squared pricing errors (RMSPE), the number of observations T and the cross sectional R2 s for
various factor models and the downside risk CAPM (DR-CAPM). The two leftmost columns present models based on
the first eight principal components of the test assets (PC1 – PC8). The third column presents a model based on the
first two principal components of the currency portfolios (PC cur1 and PC cur2). The fourth column presents a model
based on the first two principal components of the commodity portfolios (PC com1 and PC com2). The fifth column
presents a model based on the first three principal components of the stock portfolios (PC ff1 – PC ff3). The sixth and
seventh columns present models based on combinations of the principal components in the previous three columns. Test
assets are six currency portfolios, monthly re-sampled based on the interest rate differential with the US, the six Fama
& French portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market and five commodity futures portfolios, monthly re-sampled based
on basis. The sample period is January 1974 to December 2008 for a total of 420 observations. Starred estimates
