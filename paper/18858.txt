ABSTRACT
While the link between physical activity and health has been studied, there are several limitations that
persist in this literature relating to external and internal validity of the estimates, potential measurement
error in self-reported weight and risk factors, failure to account for physical activity beyond exercise,
and failure to separate the effects of exercise from other forms of physical activity. This study addresses
these gaps and assesses plausibly causal effects of recreational exercise and other physical activity
(including work-related activity) on the risk factors for heart disease, utilizing a population-based longitudinal
dataset that contains objective information on key risk factors. We estimate fixed effects specifications
that account for a host of unobservable confounding factors, and further estimate specifications with
lagged outcome measures that allow us to bound plausibly causal effects under reasonable assumptions.
There are four key patterns of results that emerge. First, the lagged effect of physical activity is almost
always larger than the current effect. This suggests that current risk factors, not only obesity but also
high blood pressure and heart rate, take years to develop, which underscores the importance of consistent
physical activity to ward off heart disease. Second, we find that in general physical activity reduces
risk factors for heart disease even after controlling, to some extent, for unobservable confounding
influences. Third, not only recreational but work-related physical activity appears to protect against
heart disease. Finally, there is evidence of a dose-response relationship such that higher levels of recreational
exercise and other physical activity have a greater protective effect. Our estimates of the contemporaneous
and durable effects suggest that the observed declines in high levels of recreational exercise and other
physical activity can potentially account for between 12-30% of the increase in obesity, hypertension,
diabetes, and heart disease observed over the sample period, ceteris paribus.

Introduction
A comprehensive report of the U.S. Surgeon General (U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services 1996) concluded that physical activity ameliorates many of the risk factors for
heart disease, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and a rapid pulse, as well as reduces the
incidence of diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, angina, heart attack, and stroke with which they
are associated. However, the studies upon which these conclusions rest suffer from a number of
weaknesses. While the effects found in randomized controlled studies are plausibly causal, they
may lack external validity since these studies are based on small, convenience samples of
persons whose behavior may not generalize to the overall population (Stamler et al. 1989; Arroll
and Beaglehole 1992; Kelley and McClellan 1994). In contrast, studies that have utilized
population-based samples generally do not control for the many confounding factors that affect
both physical activity as well as health, and thus it is not clear whether their results can be
considered causal (Arraiz, Wigle, Mao 1992; Sherman et al. 1994; Hu et al. 2007). Thus, these
studies often lack internal validity. In addition, the population-based samples used in these
studies mainly contain self-reported rather than objectively-measured characteristics, such as
height, weight, and the presence of high blood pressure, which may be subject to systematic
misreporting or under-reporting and thus lead to biased estimates.
In this study, we address these limitations and assess plausibly causal effects of physical
activity on the risk factors for heart disease using the first National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) and its follow-up study, the NHANES I Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study (NHEFS). The NHANES and NHEFS constitute a population-based
longitudinal survey that objectively measures weight, blood pressure, pulse, and a host of other
behaviors and characteristics for approximately 9,300 persons. To the best of our knowledge,
2

this is the only population-based dataset in the U.S. that provides longitudinal information on
measured (as opposed to self-reported) risk factors for heart disease.
The nature of the NHANES thus enables us to make a number of contributions. First,
unlike virtually all prior studies, we estimate the effects on health of both recreational exercise as
well as of physical activity at work and elsewhere. The importance of disentangling the effects
of recreational exercise from other physical activity stems from the likelihood that both types of
activity may have differential effects on health. The importance of considering physical activity
levels beyond just recreational exercise derives from the fact that for the average individual
recreational exercise typically constitutes only about 3-4% of their total daily physical exertion
(Colman and Dave 2011). In addition, our measure of physical activity also includes activity at
work, which is often excluded in prior studies. Work-related physical activity constitutes the
largest component of total physical exertion for the average individual: approximately 32% for
working-aged males, and 20% for working-aged females (American Time Use Surveys-ATUS
2010). Hence, it is important to consider the totality of an individual’s physical activity
including their work-related activity, while separating the effects of exercise from that of other
activities, which we do in this study.
Saffer et al. (2011) and Colman and Dave (2011) also show that there is considerable
substitution between work-related physical activity, exercise, and other forms of recreational
activity. Specifically, during an economic downturn, job loss induces individuals to increase
their recreational exercise though their total physical activity level declines due to a large
decrease in work-related physical activity (Colman and Dave 2011). It is difficult to assess the
implications of these shifts on health without evidence on the differential effects of recreational
exercise and other physical activity on health - evidence which we provide in this study.

3

Second, the availability of repeated observations on the same persons makes it possible to
control for many of the unobserved confounding factors that affect both physical activity and
health. Third, the objectivity of the measurements enables us to avoid the measurement error
that has plagued prior research. Finally, NHANES I and its follow-up study generally predated
the sharp rise in obesity in the U.S. and thus bypass some of the time-series confounding relating
to the bi-directional link between obesity (and its adverse health consequences) and physical
activity. Hence, we are able to establish baseline effects of physical activity on the risk factors
for heart disease over a time period when obesity was stable, which can then be used to inform
whether and to what extent physical activity can account for subsequent observed trends in these
risk factors.
The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in
the empirical analyses. Section 3 outlines our empirical methodology in identifying the effects
of physical activity measures on health. Section 4 discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes
with a discussion of the implications of our estimates.

Data

2.1

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
The NHANES I is a national probability sample of 31,973 persons ages 1 to 75 in the

U.S., interviewed from 1971 to 1974. A random subset of 23,808 persons, the “examination
sample”, provided more detailed information. Examiners measured respondents’ heights,
weights, skinfolds (measure of body fat), and other features, and doctors examined them for
signs of nutritional deficiency as well as any obvious medical problem. An additional random
sample of 6,913 persons ages 24 to 75, the “augmentation sample”, was interviewed in 1974 and
4

1975. These respondents provided virtually the same information as the examination sample, and
in addition were given complete physical examinations by physicians, and answered a series of
questions on general psychological well-being (GWB).
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a Follow-up
survey to NHANES I spanning the years 1982 to 1984. The follow-up was meant to locate the
14,407 person who were part of the examination sample of NHANES I and were between 25 and
74 years old during the original survey. Ninety-three percent were either located or ascertained
to have died; of these, valid responses were obtained from 91%, providing a sample of 12,220
persons. For persons who had died before the Follow-up survey, proxy responses were obtained
from family members or friends. The Follow-up survey collected information on the
respondents’ current health or, if not still living, cause of death, income, medical history since
the first survey, how often the respondent ate various foods, and also measured their weights,
blood pressure, and pulse.

2.2

Measures of Risk Factors, Health, and Physical Activity
We compute the individual’s body mass index (BMI) based on the conventional

definition, that is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters-squared. The calculation of
BMI in the first wave used the values of height and weight measured during the examination,
which took place in mobile examination trailers, where subjects wore paper uniforms and rubber
slippers provided by the NHANES staff.1 Height was not measured in the Follow-up interview.
Therefore, the BMI calculation in the second wave uses the respondent’s measured height from
the first wave on the assumption that height is stable for working-aged adults.
1

The Follow‐up survey measured respondents’ weights in their usual clothing. Thus the follow‐up weights were
heavier by the amount of the subjects’ clothing. There is no need to explicitly adjust for this since as long as the
weight of the respondents’ indoor clothing is approximately the same from one person to the next it will not affect
correlations between weight and other variables. On average clothes weigh about 4‐5 pounds, and the mean
effect of clothing on weight is captured by the year fixed effects included in all models.

5

In addition to BMI, we use three other objectively-measured risk factors for heart disease:
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and the resting heart rate. In NHANES I, these
measurements, like height and weight, were taken in the mobile examination trailer, whereas in
the follow-up they were taken largely in the respondents’ homes. It is plausible that both pulse
and blood pressure would be higher in a government trailer than in one’s home. But as long as
the difference between home and trailer measurements was about the same for each respondent,
the wave/year indicator included in all models will capture this difference. Subsequently, the
different circumstances of measurement will not affect the correlations between the
measurements and other characteristics of the respondents.
NHANES I asks two questions on physical activity, one regarding recreational exercise
and another regarding physical activity other than exercise. The question on non-recreational
physical activity is the same in the first NHANES I sample (from 1971 to 1974), in the
Augmentation sample (from 1974 to 1975), and in the Follow-up survey. It probes: “In your
usual day, aside from recreation, are you physically very active, moderately active, or quite
inactive?” We create dichotomous indicators for each response. The question on recreational
exercise differed slightly between the initial survey and the Augmentation survey. In the initial
survey the question reads: “Do you get much exercise in the things you do for recreation (sports,
or hiking, or anything like that), or hardly any exercise, or in between?” The possible responses
are: “much exercise”, “moderate exercise”, and “little or no exercise”. The Augmentation sample
questionnaire asks: “In things you do for recreation, for example: sports, hiking, dancing and so
forth, do you get much exercise, moderate exercise, or little or no exercise?” We consider these
questions similar enough to code the responses the same way, and create dichotomous indicators
for each response.

6

Both surveys also ask whether the respondent had certain medical conditions. The
Follow-up interview does not inquire about all the conditions queried in the original survey, and
asks about additional conditions not asked in the first survey. For many of the conditions, the
follow-up asks when the condition or event occurred, from which we can infer whether the
respondent had the condition at the time of the first survey. We create dichotomous indicators for
the conditions covered in both surveys as well as for those whose presence in the first survey can
be inferred from the follow-up. These are: 1) arthritis; 2) asthma; 3) colitis; 4) diabetes; 5)
emphysema; 6) gallbladder; 7) heart attack; 8) high blood pressure; 9) kidney disease; 10)
nervous breakdown; 11) stroke; 12) thyroid disease; 13) ulcer; and 14) cancer.
We also create dichotomous indicators for various socio-demographic measures
including different categories of marital status, gender, labor force status, and race and ethnicity.
Both the original and follow-up surveys report income in categories, though the categories differ
substantially to reflect the large inflation between 1971 and 1984. We create a continuous
income measure by imputing to each respondent the midpoint of his or her income category, and
for those whose income is in the top category, we assign the average income above the cut-off
based on a Weibull distribution.2 Education is measured by indicators for the highest grade
completed.

2.3

Analysis Sample
The size of the final analysis sample depends on the outcome being studied. For purposes

of illustration, we use BMI, although the calculations are virtually identical with other outcomes.
Of the 12,220 participants who were traced in the Follow-up survey, 1,697 died prior to the
Follow-up interview, 560 have missing values of either BMI or one of the activity variables, and
2

We confirm that our estimates are not sensitive to alternative imputations: 1) other extreme value distributions;
2) imputing the highest income category at the top‐coded value; and 3) controlling for income in the models as
dichotomous indicators for the income categories.

7

1,274 have missing values for the other covariates. Finally, we drop 3,256 respondents over 60
years old in either wave, for two reasons. First, since height is only measured in the first wave,
and declines with age, BMI is measured with increasing error for older respondents. Second,
much of the variation in non-recreational physical activity reflects differences between persons
working and not working, and between those in physically active occupations and other
occupations. As noted earlier, among working-aged adults, about 26% of total daily physical
exertion is derived from work-related activities (ATUS 2010). This variation is lost among
seniors because very few of them are in the labor force.

3.

Analytical Framework
The objective of this study is to assess the effect of recreational exercise and other

physical activity on the risk factors for heart disease. A number of prior studies, such as those
referenced above, have considered this question with longitudinal data; in fact, one prior study of
one of our outcomes (BMI) also used the NHANES I and the Follow-up (Williamson et al.
1992). However, the models used in prior studies have not taken full advantage of the
longitudinal nature of their data and fail to control for the many confounding factors that cause a
person both to be physically active and to have risk factors for heart diseases.3 More specifically,
the two most common models estimated in prior studies are the following:
(1)
and
(2)

3

In the language of the treatment effects literature, prior studies have not availed themselves of the possibilities
of controlling for selection into “treatment”, which in this case is “physical activity”. This limits the internal validity
of the estimates from this literature due to the possibility of selection bias.

health),

is a vector of individual characteristics that do not vary over time (such as race),

is a measure of physical activity, and

,

includes all the time-varying unobserved influences on

the outcome. The subscripts denote the ith individual observed in time period t.
The weakness of such models is that there are almost certainly many variables in

and

that affect physical activity but cannot be observed. For example, the respondent may have
inherited a tendency to worry about his health or the individual may be relatively more forwardlooking or risk-averse, which would cause him to watch his diet as well as to exercise. Since the
inherited portion of someone’s heath anxiety or their risk-aversion or future-orientation (time
preference in the economics jargon) cannot be observed, it becomes part of the error term, and,
being correlated with physical activity, biases the coefficients in these prior studies.
Hence we estimate a version of equation (1) that allows us to remove many of the
unobserved confounding variables. Including controls for national trends (γt) in the outcome, our
model is:

We test for the consistency of fixed versus random effects for all models based on the Hausman test, and in all
cases we reject the random effects model suggesting that the Zi are correlated with physical activity and hence the
fixed effects model is preferred.
5
One weakness of the FE (or FD) method is that it may be more vulnerable than ordinary least squares (OLS) to
measurement‐error bias, the bias being higher, the higher the correlation between the independent variables and
their lagged values (Griliches & Hausman 1986). In our case the time between waves—about 10 years—is

9

parameter of interest is δ, the effect of physical activity (PA) on health-related outcomes and risk
factors for heart disease. Equations (3) and (4) can be interpreted as an individual-level health
production function, which relates health inputs and health investments such as physical activity
and education to health outputs such as obesity, diabetes, and heart conditions (Grossman 2000).
First-differencing and FE methods solve the omitted variables problem as long as all the
important omitted factors that affect selection into treatment are time-invariant. Indeed, these
methods allow us to account for key unobserved time-invariant confounding factors (Angrist and
Pischke 2009) such as risk preference, time preference (whether the individual is present- or
future-oriented), stable personality traits, parental investments, family background,
genetic/hereditary traits, and other prior health investments. But it is possible that important
time-varying factors also influence both physical activity and the outcome. Among the most
important such factors is the prior level of the outcome. Suppose, for example, the outcome is
BMI. It is not only likely that physical activity reduces BMI contemporaneously, but also that
BMI affects future physical activity. For example, a person who becomes obese may switch to a
more sedentary job. Thus prior obesity affects selection into the current level of physical activity.
To account for this, we also estimate the following model.
(5)
Estimating (5) will produce consistent estimates of

so long as selection into physical activity

depends only on the lagged value of the outcome once we control for the other characteristics of
the respondent that we can observe. One advantage to estimating both (4) and (5) is that if at
least one of the models is correctly specified, and if selection into physical activity is negatively

sufficiently long that the change in physical activity is relatively large, which would tend to minimize this bias. For
instance, the share of respondents who are very physically active drops by about a third from the first to the
second wave, while the shares that are moderately active and that exercise with moderate intensity rise by about
the same amount.

10

correlated with the lagged outcome (which it is, in all of the outcomes we consider), the true
causal effect will lie between the two estimates (Guryan 2001; Angrist & Pischke 2009). That is,
if the true model is (5) but we estimate (4), the coefficients on physical activity will be too large.
On the other hand, if the true model is (4) but we estimate (5), the coefficients will be too small.
More formally, we can bound the true causal effect of physical activity on health as follows, by
considering the estimate of δ from equations (4) and (5).

(6)
As a further robustness check, we can gauge whether we have uncovered causal effects by
assessing outcomes that are themselves caused by the risk factors we examine. For examine, if
an increase in physical activity reduces blood pressure, and if a decrease in blood pressure
reduces heart disease, we should find that heart disease is negatively related to physical activity
as well. Therefore we also estimate the effect of physical activity on other heart- and obesityrelated outcomes that are available for both waves of the NHANES, including self-reported
diabetes, high blood pressure, angina, and heart trouble.

4.

Results
As evident from the means reported in Table 1, the persons sampled in the NHANES I

became substantially less active in general during the ten years that on average separated their
two interviews. The proportion of respondents reporting they that were very active outside of
recreational exercise fell by about 37% among non-Hispanic whites (from 48.8% to 30.7%), and
by about 30% for the other racial and ethnic categories. Similarly, the prevalence of a high level
of recreational exercise also declined among non-Hispanic whites (by about 20%) but increased
among the other racial and ethnic groups.
11

It is difficult to discern from the means the trends in the objectively-measured risk
factors, partly because, as mentioned above, the circumstances of measurement may have
differed between the NHANES I and the Follow-up interviews. This is especially noticeable in
the average pulse rate, which appears to have declined by 10 beats per minute between the two
surveys. This likely reflects differences in the circumstances of measurement since, as far as we
know, no medication to slow the pulse rate spread rapidly between the early 1970s and the early
1980s. Medication may, however, explain the decline in average blood pressure over this period
(Kumanyika et al. 1998). As a further check, we also analyze self-reported hypertension. As
shown in the Table 1, including those whose measured blood pressure is high as well as those
who take medicine to reduce their blood pressure, the proportion with high blood pressure
approximately doubled across all racial and ethnic groups. These unconditional means suggest
that the decline in physical activity between the two waves coincided with a worsening of the
risk factors for heart disease. However, due to possible confounding with national trends, with
the aging of the sample, and with other factors, we cannot infer causal effects from a comparison
of means. We therefore turn to the multivariate regression results. For all regression models, the
reported standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation in the error term over time for each
individual.
Table 2 presents models for body mass index (BMI). Specification 1 estimates an OLS
model relating lagged activity measures to BMI. Specification 2 estimates the first-differenced
(identical to fixed effects) model specified in equation (4), and the final specification estimates
the model with the lagged dependent variable specified in equation (5). Several patterns stand
out in these models. First, the lagged effect of physical activity is almost always larger than the
current effect. For instance, individuals who were very active (excluding recreational exercise) in

12

the previous wave had a lower BMI by about 1.07 points in the follow-up wave, relative to
individuals who were inactive. In contrast, contemporaneous levels of high activity (excluding
recreational exercise) also reduced BMI, but by a smaller margin (0.42 points in model 2 and
0.31 points in model 3). That is, while current physical activity levels have a protective effect
towards reducing the risk factors for heart disease, the estimates suggest that there are strong
lagged and durable effects of physical activity. This may indicate that current risk factors, not
only obesity but also high blood pressure and heart rate, take years to develop, which emphasizes
the importance of consistent physical activity to ward off heart disease.
Second, almost all results for all outcomes conform to equation (6): in general,
controlling for the lagged dependent variable suggests a larger effect than controlling for fixed
effects. This implies that the true effect is between the coefficients in columns 2 and 3 of each
table, implying that in general physical activity reduces risk factors for heart disease even after
controlling, to some extent, for unobservable influences. Thus, with respect to BMI, high-levels
of physical activity (excluding recreational exercise) reduce BMI by between 0.31 to 0.42 points
(relative to inactivity) and high levels of recreational exercise reduce BMI by between 0.28 to
0.78 points (relative to little or no exercise).
Third, not only recreational but other physical activity (most of which is work-related)
appears to also protect against heart disease. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
magnitudes of the protective effect for both types of activities (recreational exercise versus
other/work-related physical activity) are the same.6 Colman and Dave (2011) show that
individuals who lose their jobs during an economic recession raise their exercise levels due to a

6

However, this is not to say that the effects of work‐related or other physical activity are necessarily uniform
across all individuals. It is possible that work‐related physical activity may have muted effects on health, or even
adverse effects, for individuals in certain physically‐demanding occupations that have very high sustained energy
demands. For a discussion, see Kukkonen‐Harjula (2007).

13

greater availability of time, though their total physical exertion declines due to a larger drop in
work-related physical activity. Our estimates imply that this net decline in physical activity
during an economic downturn would have a net adverse effect on individuals’ risk factors for
heart disease.
Fourth, the models indicate suggestive evidence of a dose-response relationship. In
general, the protective effects of high levels of recreational exercise and other activity are
stronger than the protective effects of moderate levels, relative to the effects of no exercise or the
effects of inactivity.7
Tables 3 and 4 present models respectively for measured systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, and Table 5 presents models for the measured pulse rate. While most of these effects
are imprecisely estimated with large standard errors, the patterns remain robust. In general,
physical activity measures (especially other physical activity besides recreational exercise, most
of which is comprised of work-related activities) has a strong durable protective effect in
reducing blood pressure and reducing the resting heart rate. A number of studies indicate that a
faster resting heart rate is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality (see for instance, Kannel et al.
1987). Again, we find protective effects for both recreational exercise and other work-related
physical activity, at least with respect to blood pressure. With respect to the pulse rate, estimates
suggest that a high level of other work-related physical activity has a lagged durable effect
(reducing the pulse rate by about 1 beat per minute) though no discernible contemporaneous
effect. A high level of recreational exercise, on the other hand, has both strong contemporaneous
7

The effects of the other included covariates (not reported) on risk factors for heart disease and the other health
conditions are consistent with the literature. In general, educated individuals tend to be healthier, which is
consistent with Grossman and Kaestner (1997) who suggest that educated individuals tend to be more efficient in
“producing” health and engage in more (less) healthy (risky) behaviors. Higher levels of income also generally have
a protective effect on health. Risk factors for heart disease and health tend to worsen over the life cycle. The
effects of marital status and race/ethnicity vary depending on the risk factor and morbidity in question. Full results
are available upon request.

effects (reducing the resting pulse rate by between 1.1 to 2.6 beats per minute) as well as a strong
lagged effect (reducing the pulse rate by about 1.2 beats per minute).
Table 6 specifically considers the incidence of hypertension. Across all models, all
coefficient estimates are negative implying that both forms of physical activity reduce the
prevalence of high blood pressure contemporaneously as well as in the long term. We estimate
that a high level of recreational exercise reduces the probability of having high blood pressure by
between 2.8 and 8.4 percentage points, which represents a 10-31% reduction in the prevalence
relative to the mean in the Follow-up interviews. A high level of other physical activity reduces
the likelihood of hypertension by between 2.3 to 4.3 percentage points (about a 9-16% reduction
relative to the mean).
Given that both recreational exercise and other physical activity reduces the risk factors
associated with heart disease (BMI, high blood pressure, and a high resting heart rate), we would
expect favorable effects on heart-related morbidities. Thus, Tables 7-9 present a plausibility
check by assessing effects on outcomes that are themselves caused by these risk factors.
Specifically, we consider diabetes (Table 7), angina (Table 8), and heart disease (Table 9). In
general, these estimates suggest that physical activity measures are associated with a reduced
prevalence of each of these heart- and obesity-related morbidities. For instance, a high level of
recreational exercise and other physical activity reduces the probability of diabetes by as much as
2 percentage points (Model 3 in Table 7) and the probability of heart disease by as much as 2-4
percentage points (Model 3 in Table 9). These results are validating in that they confirm the
causal chain from physical activity to a reduction in risk factors for heart disease to ultimately a
reduction in heart-related and obesity-related disease conditions.

15

It may be that estimating a causal effect requires controlling for time-varying factors that
may influence both the outcome and physical activity. We include a number of such factors, such
as the respondent’s age, marital status, state or region of residence, and month of interview to
account for seasonality in all reported models. From the NHANES questionnaire, we can also
construct a great many indicators for health conditions. Some of these conditions, or the lack of
them, may be caused by physical activity, such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure,
angina, cancer, and a number of other morbidities. Since these conditions affect the outcomes we
study, it might seem reasonable to include them as covariates. But doing so would bias the
coefficients on physical activity because in part these conditions also result from physical
activity (Rosenbaum 1984). Therefore, in supplementary analyses (not reported but available
upon request), we include indicators for a number of conditions that may affect the outcomes
under study -- but do not, as far as we can determine, result from physical activity -- conditions
such as epilepsy, detached retina, glaucoma, cataracts, diverticulitis, Parkinson’s, cirrhosis,
psoriasis, migraines, kidney disease, and emphysema. The estimates from these extended models
are virtually the same as those reported in Tables 2-9. This robustness is further validating and
adds a degree of confidence to our causal bounds of the effects of activity measures on risk
factors and morbidities.

Summary & Discussion
While the link between physical activity and health has been studied in the past, there are

several limitations that persist in the literature. Estimates from randomized controlled studies are
often based on small, convenience samples and difficult to generalize to the population-level,
while observational population-based studies often fail to account for the various confounding
factors that drive both physical activity and health. Furthermore, many of the prior studies have
16

either only considered recreational exercise, which provides an incomplete picture since such
exercise typically constitutes only about 3-4% of an individual’s total physical exertion, or failed
to separately consider other forms of physical activity, especially activity levels that include
work-related physical activity. This latter point is significant since work-related physical activity
is the single largest component of total physical exertion for working aged adults, and workrelated physical activity and recreational exercise often move opposite to each other over the
business cycle. That is, as individuals increase their labor supply during periods of high
employment, they tend to reduce their recreational exercise on average. Hence, it is important to
consider both of these forms of activities separately when assessing their effects on health
markers. Finally, much of the prior work has relied on self-reported measures of weight and
height, and risk factors such as blood pressure, which may be subject to measurement error.
In this study, we addressed these limitations and assessed the plausibly causal effects of
recreational exercise and other physical activity, including work-related physical activity, on the
risk factors for heart disease using a longitudinal population-based dataset with objectively
measured risk factors. Fixed-effects models control for all time-invariant observed and
unobserved confounding factors. In addition, comparing these estimates with those derived from
models with a lagged dependent variable allows us to bound the causal effect under reasonable
assumptions (Angrist & Pischke 2009).
We find robust evidence that both recreational exercise and other physical activity have a
similar protective effect on health by reducing the risk factors (BMI, high blood pressure, and
resting heart rate) associated with heart disease. In supplementary models, we also find positive
effects on actual health outcomes, including a reduction in diabetes, angina, and heart disease.

17

There is also some suggestive evidence that physical activity has durable effects on health,
emphasizing the importance of engaging in a consistently active lifestyle over time.
Table 1 documented the reduced prevalence in high levels of exercise and other physical
activity between the two waves of the NHANES. Given the health-promoting effects of
recreational exercise and other forms of physical activity, these declining trends in activity levels
have adverse implications for population health. Brownson, Boehmer, and Luke (2005) report
longer-term trends (up to 50 years for certain measures) in physical activity in the U.S. They
also conclude that there is an overall trend of declining total physical activity due to a decrease in
work-related physical activity, declining transportation activity, declining home-based activity,
and increased sedentary activity. Church et al. (2011) document a decrease in daily occupationrelated energy expenditure by more than 100 calories between 1960–62 and 2003–06, based on
the NHANES, suggesting a declining trend in work-related physical activity levels.
The results from this study suggest that the reduced levels of physical activity will lead to
adverse consequences on weight-based health and heart-related morbidity by increasing the
incidence of obesity, high blood pressure, and the resting heart rate, ceteris paribus. Based on
the midpoint of the bounded effects (Models 2 and 3 for each outcome), our contemporaneous
estimates indicate that the reduced levels of high recreational exercise and other physical activity
(and shifts in other activity measures) can explain about 3-10% of the increase in BMI and
hypertension, and consequently about 2-8% of the increase in diabetes and heart disease,
between the two waves of the NHANES. We note that since physical activity has a strong
durable effect on risk factors and morbidities, these explained effects are understated.8 Further
accounting for the durable effects (Model 1 for each outcome), the reduced high levels of
8

Our durable effects are estimated over a 10 year period on average. To the extent that physical activity has a
cumulative effect that persists beyond this period, the observed declines in high levels of exercise and physical
activity can lead to further worsening of the risk factors and an increase in weight‐ and heart‐related morbidities.

18

exercise and physical activity observed over the sample period can account for an additional 1020% of the increase in the noted risk factors and illness conditions.
