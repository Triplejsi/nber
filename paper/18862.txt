When Is Prevention More Profitable than Cure? The Impact of Time-Varying Consumer Heterogeneity
Michael Kremer and Christopher M. Snyder
NBER Working Paper No. 18862
March 2013
JEL No. D42,I18,L11,O31
ABSTRACT
We argue that in pharmaceutical markets, variation in the arrival time of consumer heterogeneity creates
differences between a producer’s ability to extract consumer surplus with preventives and treatments,
potentially distorting R&D decisions. If consumers vary only in disease risk, revenue from treatments—sold
after the disease is contracted, when disease risk is no longer a source of private information—always
exceeds revenue from preventives. The revenue ratio can be arbitrarily high for sufficiently skewed
distributions of disease risk. Under some circumstances, heterogeneity in harm from a disease, learned
after a disease is contracted, can lead revenue from a treatment to exceed revenue from a preventative.
Calibrations suggest that skewness in the U.S. distribution of HIV risk would lead firms to earn only
half the revenue from a vaccine as from a drug. Empirical tests are consistent with the predictions
of the model that vaccines are less likely to be developed for diseases with substantial disease-risk
heterogeneity.

1. Introduction
Many public-health and industry experts believe that firms earn more revenue from disease treatments, such
as drugs, than preventives, such as vaccines (see, e.g., Rosenberg 1999), and that stronger government support is needed for the development of preventive health technologies. These views are especially common
in the case of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) (see, e.g., Thomas 2002), and indeed governments
have established special programs to support HIV vaccine research such as the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative (IAVI).
In this paper, we argue that time-varying consumer heterogeneity can drive a wedge between relative
private and social incentives to invest in preventives and treatments. We show that heterogeneity among consumers in disease risk will limit firms’ ability to extract consumer surplus from preventives, biasing firms’
R&D incentives away from preventives toward treatments compared to a social planner’s. Heterogeneity in
harm from infection, on the other hand, can lead to the opposite bias, toward preventives. The model also
suggests when these biases are likely to be quantitatively important. Firms’ bias against investing in preventives will be strongest for diseases with skewed distributions of disease risk (i.e., with high risk concentrated
in a small segment of the population). Common diseases cannot exhibit much skewness as a mathematical
principle, so the bias toward preventives has the most scope to affect R&D incentives for relatively rare
diseases with risk heterogeneity. Calibrations for HIV suggest that the rates of partner change and other
risk factors are sufficiently skewed that the bias against HIV preventives may be substantial. Empirically,
we find that the relative likelihood of developing treatments compared to preventives is greater for diseases
with heterogeneity in disease risk.
To see why heterogeneity in disease risk can lead to a bias against preventives, consider the following
numerical example. Suppose a monopoly pharmaceutical manufacturer sells directly to 100 rational, riskneutral consumers, who will suffer harm quantified as $100 from contracting the disease. The firm can
develop a treatment or a preventive; both are costless to manufacture, are perfectly effective, and have no
side effects. Suppose first that the consumers are homogeneous, having the same 19% risk of contracting a
disease. If the firm develops a treatment, it can sell to all people who contract the disease at a price (equal
to the avoided harm) of $100. Expected treatment revenue is $1,900 because an expected 19 consumers
contract the disease and buy the treatment. If the firm develops a preventive, it could sell to all 100 consumers
at a price, equal to consumers’ expected harm of $19, for total revenue of $1,900. With homogeneous
consumers, the firm’s expected revenue is $1,900, which represents full extraction of consumer surplus in
the market, whether it sells a treatment or preventive.
Consider the same example except suppose now that consumers are heterogeneous in disease risk, with
90 having a 10% chance of contracting a disease while 10 have a 100% chance. Because the number
of people expected to contract the disease is the same 19 as in the homogenous-consumer case, expected
treatment revenue remains the same at $1,900. On the other hand, the firm’s revenue from a preventive falls.
The firm can either sell to the 10 high-risk consumers at their expected harm of $100, or sell to all consumers

1

at a price of $10, equal to the low-risk consumers’ expected harm. Either way, the firm’s revenue from a
preventive is $1,000, only about half the revenue from a treatment and only about half the social value of
the product.
To understand how these results generalize, in Section 2 we provide a simple benchmark model of a
monopolist that sells a perfectly safe and effective product, which is costless to produce, directly to rational,
risk-neutral consumers. The analysis in Section 3 shows that in this simple benchmark model, if consumers
are heterogeneous only in disease risk, then for any disease-risk distribution, monopoly revenue is higher
with a treatment than a preventive. The potential social welfare loss from distortions in research incentives
is related to the ratio of preventive to treatment revenue: as a percentage of total disease burden, the social
welfare loss can be as high as one minus this ratio. The ratio of preventive to treatment revenue equals 1/2
for a uniform distribution of disease risk, is greater than 1/2 for monotonic distributions that are negatively
skewed, and is less than 1/2 for monotonic distributions that are positively skewed. Indeed for sufficiently
positively skewed distributions, the revenue ratio can be driven to zero; and thus the social cost of distortions
in R&D incentives can approach the entire disease burden.
How close to zero the ratio can be driven is limited by the prevalence of the disease in the population.
This point is easiest to see in the extreme case in which the disease is ubiquitous: if nearly everyone is expected to contract the disease, there is little scope for the distribution of disease risk to exhibit the dispersion
required to generate a substantial gap between preventive and treatment revenue. We compute a tight lower
bound on the ratio as a function of disease prevalence and show that this bound is strictly increasing. The
implication is that risk heterogeneity can induce little difference in the incentives to develop preventives versus treatments for the most common diseases; diseases must be sufficiently rare for heterogeneity in disease
risk to substantially impair firms’ relative incentives to develop preventives.
In Section 4 we consider other types of heterogeneity. We first consider the case in which consumers
obtain private information not ex ante, as with disease risk, but ex post, after contracting the disease. Polio,
for example usually leads to fairly minor, transient symptoms, but sometimes leads to paralysis. If consumers are ex ante homogeneous, but differ in harm ex post, preventive manufacturers will be able to fully
extract consumer surplus while treatment manufacturers will not. If there are multiple sources of private
information revealed at different times, the correlation among these sources affects relative R&D incentives.
For example, if consumers vary ex ante in disease risk and also in a factor such as income that affects both
ex ante and ex post willingness to pay and if these factors are independent, firms’ bias against preventives
will be dampened. We consider a range of different correlation structures among the variety of sources of
private information.
In Section 5 we extend the benchmark model to richer, policy-relevant institutional structures such as
insurance contracts and government purchasing.1 If firms can sell future access to their products through
1 The appendix provides an extension of the model in which we relax the monopoly assumption, allowing for entry by both
preventive and treatment manufacturers and also allowing for entry by generics after a period of patent protection. The prospect of
an effective treatment can wipe out the market for a preventive, but the currently ill form a captive market for a treatment, providing
revenue even under the threat of entry by preventives and generics.

insurance or other contracts, then treatment manufacturers can always imitate preventive manufacturers and
so earn at least as much revenue with a treatment as a similarly effective preventive. If third-party purchasers
such as HMOs or governments can negotiate with pharmaceutical firms over fixed fees, they can potentially
eliminate the deadweight loss associated with pricing above marginal cost. Assuming that bargaining takes
place after R&D costs are sunk, under plausible assumptions the pharmaceutical manufacturer and the thirdparty purchaser will each capture some of the gain associated with eliminating deadweight loss. Thus the
biases in R&D decisions we found under direct-to-consumer sales will survive (though typically attenuated)
under sales to third-party purchasers. This can be seen as a standard (Klein, Crawford, and Alchian 1978)
hold-up problem. However, if bargaining takes place before R&D costs are sunk, it may be possible to
match private and social incentives for preventive and treatment R&D. This provides a potential justification
for institutional mechanisms that help commit to pricing for preventives in advance, such as those found
in the de facto operation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy in the United States or the
International Pneumococcus Advance Market Commitment (Kremer and Glennerster 2004; Snyder, Begor,
and Berndt 2011).
Having established theoretical bounds on the ratio of preventive to treatment revenue, in Section 6 we
calibrate where between these bounds the revenue ratio might fall in practical examples. We focus on the
case of HIV. Using U.S. data on the distribution of sexual partners (as well as other risk factors) to infer
infection risk, the highly skewed distribution of sexual partners leads to a highly skewed distribution of HIV
infection risk, in turn leading calibrated revenue from a preventive to fall short of that from a treatment by
a factor of between two and four. The bias persists when the joint distribution of disease risk with income
is considered. The results for HIV contrast with additional calibrations for HPV (human papillomavirus),
a more common disease with an infection-risk distribution that is consequently less skewed. We find that
calibrated revenue for an HPV preventive and is close to that for a treatment, suggesting that firms may have
less bias against developing preventives for HPV.
Section 6 also provides a separate set of calibrations based on the joint distribution of income and HIV
risk across countries to shed light on how changes in firms’ ability to price discriminate internationally
could potentially affect R&D incentives for HIV preventives relative to treatments. We find that if firms’
existing ability to price discriminate across countries were eliminated, drug revenue could potentially fall
below vaccine revenue.
Section 7 empirically tests whether infection-risk heterogeneity affects whether preventives or treatments are developed for different diseases. We construct a unique dataset including proxies for heterogeneity in infection risk (e.g., STIs, disease concentration in certain subpopulations or regions or transmission
through specialized vectors) for a cross-section of diseases. We find that disease-risk heterogeneity significantly reduces the probability of vaccine development—by over 25 percentage points—but has no effect on
drug development, consistent with the theory from Section 3.
Of course in identifying a new factor, time-varying consumer heterogeneity, which may affect the relative profitability of R&D on preventives and treatments relative to their social value, we do not seek to deny
3

the potential role of other factors. While acknowledging that other factors—scientific and technological difficulties of developing new products, manufacturing and delivery costs—may differ between preventives and
treatments; we note that these other factors will not necessarily create a wedge between relative private and
social incentives to invest in preventives as opposed to treatments. In the interest of parsimony, our benchmark model involves rational, risk-neutral consumers who do not face credit constraints. We recognize that
risk aversion, credit constraints, and behavioral factors could also affect willingness to pay for preventives
rather than treatments. The model could be readily extended to incorporate such factors in future work.
Our work contributes to several literatures. It is well understood that epidemiological externalities may
limit the ability of pharmaceutical firms to capture social value from products to prevent or treat infectious
disease, and this issue may be more acute for preventives than treatments. Papers that examine firm incentives in the presence of epidemiological externalities include Brito, Sheshinski, and Intrilligator (1991);
Boulier (2006); Francis (1997); Geoffard and Philipson (1997); Gersovitz (2003); and Gersovitz and Hammer (2004, 2005). A companion paper (Kremer, Snyder, and Williams 2012) examines the determinants of
the magnitude of these effects. However, the analysis in this paper applies to preventives more generally
rather than only to infectious diseases, and thus has implications that are analytically distinct than those
considered in the literature on epidemiological externalities. For example, our analysis also applies to vaccines that are not subject to epidemiological externalities, such as vaccines against shingles (a recurrence of
childhood chickenpox infection in adults), as well as to preventives against non-infectious diseases, such as
cholesterol-reducing drugs or heart-disease preventives. Within the class of vaccines against infectious diseases, our analysis suggests that, independent of epidemiological externalities, biases against vaccines will
be particularly severe for diseases with skewed distributions of disease risk, such as HIV; but that there may
be other diseases with heterogeneity in harm or strong negative correlations between income and infection
risk where heterogeneity creates a bias towards vaccines rather than treatments.
Our work is related to the industrial organization literature on monopoly pricing when consumers gradually learn their demands. Lewis and Sappington (1994) and Courty (2003) assume consumers are initially
identical, whereas we assume consumers have ex ante private information about their disease risk. Courty
and Li (2000) compare optimal ex ante and ex post schemes under general conditions, where ex ante schemes
are allowed to involve refunds. Refunds are impossible for preventives because, once the preventive is administered, the benefit is inalienable from the consumer. Clay, Sibley, and Srinagesh (1992) and especially
Miravete (1996) are closest to our work. Our application to disease risk calls for a specific mapping from ex
ante private values into ex post types, whereas Miravete considers general functional forms for the mapping.
The specificity in this one dimension allows us to examine general distributions of ex ante disease risk rather
than the particular class of beta distributions examined by Miravete, and to establish bounds on the profit
ratio as a function of skewness of the disease-risk distribution and as a function of disease prevalence, all of
which are new results in the literature. Our analysis of social welfare in Section 3, calibrations and empirical
work, and the appendix analyzing generic competition between preventives and treatments after expiry of
intellectual-property rights are new as well.
4

Our computation of tight bounds on the ratio of preventive to treatment profit is related to Malueg’s
(1994) bounds on the ratio of monopoly to competitive welfare as a function of the demand curvature and
to Maleug and Snyder’s (2006) bound on the ratio of profits from discriminatory to uniform pricing as a
function of the number of markets. We also contribute to the literature on the response of innovation in
R&D-intensive industries (see Newell, Jaffee, and Stavins 1999; Acemoglu and Linn 2004; Finkelstein
2004).

2. Model
We begin with a stylized benchmark model of a monopolist selling directly to consumers, deferring analysis
of more complicated models with third-party purchasers to Section 5 and of models with competition among
producers to the appendix (Appendix B). The monopoly pharmaceutical manufacturer faces a choice of
developing a preventive or treatment.
To simplify the presentation, we will initially consider the case in which preventives and treatments are
perfectly effective, have no side effects, and are costless to manufacture and administer. (Proposition 14 in
the appendix shows that the key results continue to hold when these assumptions are relaxed.) The firm’s
only cost is the present discounted value of the fixed cost of developing product j, denoted k j ∈ [0, ∞),
where j = p for the preventive and j = t for the treatment. Let p j ∈ [0, ∞) be the present discounted value
of the price the firm receives for product j. Let π j be producer surplus (equivalently revenue in the case
of costless production), Π j = π j − k j be profit, CS j be consumer surplus, WE j = CS j + Π j be equilibrium
social welfare, and WF j be first-best social welfare (i.e., social welfare when the product’s price is set to
marginal cost) from product j. The difference between these two social-welfare measures is deadweight
loss: DWL j = WF j − WE j . Using notation that drops the subscript j for products, let WE be equilibrium
social welfare given the firm’s equilibrium choice of product, WF be first-best social welfare given the
first-best choice of product, and DWL be the difference DWL = WF − WE.
Consider the case in which the firm sells directly to risk-neutral consumers. Before purchasing any
product, consumer i learns his or her disease risk, xi ∈ [0, 1], i.e., the probability he or she contracts the
disease. Assume xi is a random variable with cumulative distribution function F(xi ). Normalizing the mass
of consumers to unity, the mass of consumers with disease risk at least as great as some value x is denoted
F̄(xi ) = 1 − F(xi ). The mean disease risk in the population (also the realized disease prevalence in the
absence of a preventive) is x =

R1
0

xi dF(xi ). Assume the firm knows the distribution of xi in the population

but cannot price discriminate across consumers based on xi .2
If a consumer contracts a disease and has not had the preventive or does not receive the treatment, he
or she experiences harm hi ∈ [0, ∞) in present discounted value terms. In this and the next section, we
will assume that consumers all would pay the same amount to avoid harm h, but in Section 4 we will
2 Price

discrimination can be ruled out if xi is private information for consumers (for example, related to their sexual behavior
or intravenous drug use, conducted in private) or if xi is public information but discrimination is prevented by the difficulty of
controlling resale or other administrative, institutional, or legal barriers.

generalize the analysis to allow consumers to have various sources of heterogeneity in willingness to pay.
Let D = h

R1
0

xi dF(xi ) = hx be the total social burden of the disease, a term we will use to normalize our

welfare measures in the subsequent analysis.
We next turn to a preliminary analysis of which product the firm chooses to develop. If the firm develops
a preventive, consumers purchase before becoming infected. A consumer with disease risk p p /h would be
indifferent between purchasing the preventive at price p p and not.3 The preventive producer thus sells to the
mass of consumers F̄(p p /h) with disease risk xi ≥ p p /h, implying the profit from developing a preventive
is
Π p = max [p p F̄(p p /h)] − k p .
p p ∈[0,∞)

(1)

If the firm develops a treatment, on the other hand, the consumer purchases after becoming infected. The
profit from developing a treatment is
Πt = hx − kt .

(2)

Equation (2) holds because the treatment is optimally sold at a price that extracts the consumer’s entire ex
post surplus pt∗ = h; the treatment is purchased by the mass x of consumers who become infected. The firm
develops a preventive if Π p > max(Πt , 0), a treatment if Πt > max(Π p , 0), and neither if max(Π p , Πt ) < 0.4

3. Equilibrium with Ex Ante Heterogeneity in Disease Risk
If consumers are homogeneous, then there is no wedge between private and social R&D incentives, and the
first best is obtained in equilibrium, as the following proposition states.
Proposition 1. Assume there is no heterogeneity in the distribution of disease risk, i.e., xi = x for all i. In
equilibrium the firm makes the first-best product choice and produces the first-best quantity of the product.
The proposition follows immediately from the fact that the monopolist can extract 100% of the surplus from
homogeneous consumers with either product and thus fully internalizes social welfare.5
Heterogeneity in consumers disease risk will drive a wedge between private and social R&D incentives.
In the model, the firm cannot perfectly price discriminate based on disease risk and so is no longer able to
extract 100% of consumer surplus with a preventive. Producer surplus from a preventive, π p , will thus fall
below producer surplus from a treatment, πt , as Proposition 2, proved in the appendix (Appendix A), states.
Proposition 2. Assume there is nontrivial heterogeneity in the distribution of disease risk; i.e., at least two
distinct subintervals of (0, 1] have positive measure. Then π p < πt .
3 Arguments along the lines of Theorem 4 of Harris and Raviv (1981) establish that a simple linear price p is optimal among
p
the set of potentially complicated mechanisms that might be used to sell the preventive.
4 The remaining strategy—the firm develops both products—can be ignored in the analysis because it is weakly dominated
given products are perfectly safe, effective, and costless to manufacture. Appendix B allows for the possibility that both products
are developed in an extension with general parameter values and potential competition between manufacturers.
5 The firm may no longer have first best incentives for product development if we depart from the monopoly assumption by
allowing patent races, finite patent lives, rent-dissipating competition, etc. Appendix B analyzes these issues further.

Figure 1: Geometric comparison of producer surplus from a preventive and a treatment.
Figure 1 sketches a simple graphical proof of Proposition 2. Producer surplus from a preventive, π p ,
equals the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under inverse demand curve F̄(p p /h), while πt
equals the area under the whole curve. No matter how the rectangle is inscribed, and no matter the shape of
the curve, the area of the rectangle will be less than the area under the whole curve, so πt > π p .
The result from Proposition 2 that π p < πt has consequences for social welfare because it leaves room
for cases in which the firm prefers to develop the treatment even though the preventive is cheaper to develop
(k p < kt ) and hence would be developed in the first best. The measure of such cases is what we mean
by the firm’s “bias” against preventives. The lower is π p relative to πt , the greater the firm’s bias against
preventives. The producer-surplus ratio π p /πt (more precisely, one minus this ratio) provides a convenient
index of the bias against preventives because this ratio can be linked to the potential social cost of this bias,
as Proposition 3, proved in the appendix, formalizes.
Proposition 3. The difference between first-best social welfare, WF, and equilibrium social welfare, WE, as
a percentage of the total disease burden, D, has a tight upper bound given by 1 − π p /πt . Formally,

Proposition 2 states that the firm will be biased against preventives if there is heterogeneity in disease
risk, raising the question of how large this bias can possibly be. The next proposition, proved in the appendix,
states that in the case in which consumers fall into discrete risk classes, the number of risk classes determines
a tight lower bound on the relative producer surplus from a preventive.
7

Proposition 4. Distributions of consumers into C risk classes can be constructed such that π p /πt can be
made arbitrarily close to 1/C, a lower bound on π p /πt .
The Introduction offered an example of a disease with harm of $100 and with two risk classes (90
consumers with a 10% chance of contracting the disease and 10 with a 100% chance) in which expected
revenue from a treatment was $1,900, while a preventive producer would earn $1,000 either by selling at
$100 to 10 high risk customers or $10 to all 100 customers π p /πt = 0.53. The fact that this result was
close to 1/2 was no accident: an implication of Proposition 4 is that π p /πt can be driven down as low as,
but no lower than, 1/2 in examples with two risk classes. The example can be extended to show how it
is possible to keep increasing treatment revenue by adding risk classes while leaving preventive revenue
constant. Consider adding a third risk class with 900 individuals with a 1% disease risk. Revenue from a
preventive is unchanged at $1,000 because the firm also earns this much from selling to all 1,000 consumers
at the highest price the new consumers are willing to pay ($1). Expected treatment revenue rises to $2,800,
equal to the $1,900 earned from the original two risk classes plus $900 from the nine consumers expected
to contract the disease in the added risk class. Adding new risk classes with 10 times the consumers in the
previous one having 1/10 the disease risk leads to a $900 increase in treatment revenue leaving preventive
revenue unchanged. The ratio π p /πt falls from 0.53 to 0.36 to 0.27 as the number of risk classes is increased
from 2 to 3 to 4 in this extended example; note these values are close to the 1/C bound stated in the
proposition.
An immediate consequence of Proposition 4 is that there exist distributions of consumer types such that
π p /πt can be made arbitrarily small. This can be seen by taking the limit as C approaches infinity in the
proposition.
Proposition 5. There exist distributions of consumers such that π p /πt can be made arbitrarily close to zero.
When is the bias likely to be large? As the intuition from the two-type example provided in the Introduction suggests, the bias against preventives is especially large when a large segment of the population
has a very small probability of contracting the disease and a small segment of the population has a high
probability. Translated in more general terms, the bias against preventives should be expected to be largest
when the distribution of disease risk is skewed. Proposition 6 provides a formal statement of the relationship
between skewness of the disease-risk distribution and the ratio of producer surplus π p /πt .
Proposition 6. Let f (xi ) be a differentiable density function associated with consumer types xi . If f 0 (xi ) = 0
(implying xi is uniformly distributed), then π p /πt = 1/2. If f 0 (xi ) > 0 (a sufficient condition for negative
skewness), then π p /πt > 1/2. If f 0 (xi ) < 0 (a sufficient condition for positive skewness), then π p /πt < 1/2.
The proof is illustrated in Figure 2. The case f 0 (xi ) = 0 is drawn in Panel I of the figure. If f 0 (xi ) = 0,
then xi is uniformly distributed and has no skewness. The associated inverse demand curve F̄(p p /h) turns
out to be linear. Standard results imply that the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under a
linear demand curve is half of the area under the curve, so π p /πt = 1/2. If f 0 (xi ) > 0 as in Panel II of the

the figure shows, the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under the inverse demand curve is
more than half the area under the inverse demand curve, so π p /πt > 1/2. If f 0 (xi ) < 0 as in Panel III of the
figure, then the distribution of xi is positively skewed, and the associated inverse demand is convex. As the
figure shows, the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under the inverse demand curve is less
than half the area under the curve, so π p /πt < 1/2.
We saw from Proposition 6 that the revenue ratio π p /πt is bounded below if the monotone disease-risk
distribution is uniform or negatively skewed. Another lower bound on the revenue ratio can be obtained by
focusing on the prevalence of the disease, which in the absence of a preventive equals x. Such a bound is
empirically useful because prevalence is readily observable. Intuitively, if x is close to 1, most consumers’
disease risk must be close to 1, limiting how much heterogeneity there can be in the distribution of disease
risk. Lower values of x allow for more heterogeneity in disease risk, but there are limits to this heterogeneity
for any given value of x.
Proposition 7. Take the prevalence of the disease in the absence of a preventive, x, to be some constant in
[0, 1]. A tight lower bound on π p /πt is provided by the implicit solution for B in
B[1 − ln(Bx)] = 1.

Figure 3: Lower bound on ratio of preventive to treatment revenue as function of prevalence.
B is strictly increasing in x, with limx→0 B = 0 and limx→1 B = 1.
Figure 3 graphs numerical solutions for B as a function of x. The empirical implication of the figure is
for the most common diseases, disease-risk heterogeneity cannot be an important factor in a firm’s decision
to develop a preventive versus a treatment. For example, the figure shows that if the prevalence of the disease
is above 0.74, it is mathematically impossible to generate enough disease-risk heterogeneity to drive π p /πt
below 1/2. The results from this section that heterogeneity and skewness in disease risk contribute to a bias
against preventives are more likely to apply to sufficiently rare diseases.
We conclude the section by drawing out the social-welfare implications of the analysis. The next proposition, proved in the appendix, states that there is socially too little incentive to develop a preventive relative
to a treatment.
Proposition 8. If consumers differ only in ex ante disease risk, the firm never develops a preventive in
preference to a treatment unless it is socially efficient to do so. There exist cases in which the firm develops
a treatment but it would have been socially efficient to develop a preventive.
Proposition 8 holds whether social efficiency is measured by first-best social welfare (WF j ) or equilibrium
social welfare (WE j ). The main social-welfare implications of Propositions 1 through 6 should also be
emphasized. Proposition 5 implies that 1 − π p /πt can approach one, implying that the potential social cost
of the bias against preventives can be as large as the entire disease burden D itself. Proposition 6 implies
that the potential social cost of the bias against preventives can be as much as half the disease burden for
uniformly distributed disease risk, less for negatively skewed distributions, and more for positively skewed
distributions. In sum, the model with consumer heterogeneity in the single dimension of disease risk sug10

gests that R&D decisions may be biased against preventives and that the social loss from these biases can
be quite large for positively skewed distributions of disease risk.

4. Other Sources of Heterogeneity
The previous section restricted attention to one source of consumer heterogeneity: disease risk, xi . This
source gives consumers private information only in the ex ante period; ex post, the act of seeking treatment
reveals the consumer’s disease status. In this section we examine alternative sources of heterogeneity with
different timing structures. Section 4.1 examines heterogeneity in income, yi , a source of private information ex ante that persists ex post because it is not necessarily revealed by disease status. We show that
this source of heterogeneity is neutral, not generating a bias toward either preventives or treatments. Section 4.2 examines heterogeneity in disease harm, hi , realized after the disease is contracted, thus an ex post
source of private information. We prove that this source of heterogeneity flips the results from the case of
heterogeneity in xi and leads to a bias against treatments.
In addition to looking at the individual sources of heterogeneity, the section provides results for various
combinations of them. To allow for multiple sources of heterogeneity, the notation for random variables
needs to be generalized. Let xi , yi , and hi be realizations of random variables X representing disease risk, Y
representing income, and H representing disease harm. Let V ∈ {X,Y, H} denote the generic representation
of one of these random variables. Associated with V , let vi be a realization, FV (vi ) the distribution function,
F̄V (vi ) = 1−FV (vi ) the complementary distribution, v =

R v̄
0

vi dFV (vi ) the mean, and [0, v̄] the support. Finally,

define the value function RV = maxvi [vi F̄V (vi )]. In words, RV is the largest area under the “demand curve”
F̄V (vi ) that can be captured by an inscribed rectangle.

4.1. Income Heterogeneity
Assume that a consumer’s willingness to pay to avoid certain harm is given by his or her income, yi . Assume
the consumer learns yi ex ante, and this private information remains in the ex post period. Assume the firm
only knows the distribution of yi or, if it can observe yi , cannot discriminate on the basis of this information.
Suppose there is no other source of heterogeneity than yi .6 It is immediate that consumer heterogeneity
in yi alone reduces the revenue the firm can obtain from either product, but does not bias the firm toward
either product because the firm faces the same private information ex ante when preventives are sold as ex
post when treatments are sold. Producer surplus is the same for both products.
Next consider combined heterogeneity in xi and yi . Assume the firm cannot discriminate on xi or yi .
The analysis is complicated by the fact that xi is no longer a pure source of ex ante heterogeneity because
it may be correlated with yi , also a source of ex post heterogeneity. The expressions for preventive and
treatment profit do not lead to particularly informative comparisons for general distributions between xi and
yi . To build intuition, therefore, our approach will be to analyze three special cases that span the set of
6 Kessing and Nuscheler (2006) also study monopoly vaccine pricing when income is the sole source of consumer heterogeneity.
Their dynamic model generates a feedback effect whereby leaving the poor susceptible increases the willingness to pay of the rich.

11

possibilities: xi and yi are independent; yi is an increasing deterministic function of xi ; yi is a decreasing
deterministic function of xi (in particular we will take yi to be inversely proportional to xi ). We will use
this same three-pronged approach to analyze other combinations of sources of heterogeneity below as well.
While the analysis is restricted to just these three special cases here, it is in fact possible to compute and
compare preventive and treatment profits given any specific joint distribution of xi and yi ; and in Section 6
we illustrate how this can be calibrated with data on the distributions of HIV risk and income in the United
States and the world.
Start then by assuming that xi and yi are independent. Define the product zi = xi yi , representing the
consumer’s willingness to pay to avoid harm from the disease from an ex ante perspective, i.e., before
knowing whether he or she has contracted it but only knowing his or her risk. Using the standard notation,
let FZ (zi) be the associated distribution function, F̄Z (zi ) the complementary distribution, and z the mean. The
support of zi , derived from the supports of xi and yi , is [0, ȳ].
First consider the preventive producer’s profit-maximization problem. Consumers buy the preventive if
zi ≥ p p , implying the demand for the preventive is F̄Z (p p ). Hence
π p = max [p p F̄Z (p p )] = RZ .
p p ∈[0,∞)

(4)

In fact, (4) is the general formula for preventive revenue, which holds whether or not xi and yi are independent. Next consider the treatment producer’s profit maximization problem. Conditional on contracting the
disease, consumer i would be willing to buy the treatment as long as his or her willingness to pay yi exceeds
the price pt . Because xi is independent of yi , i’s probability of contracting the disease is the mean x. Hence
demand for the treatment is xF̄Y (pt ), implying
πt = max [xpt F̄Y (pt )] = xRY .
pt ∈[0,∞)

(5)

Revenue expressions (4) and (5) can be ranked. One of the sources of private information integrates out
of (5) and becomes the constant x; (4) retains both sources of private information and thus reflects lower
revenue. We have the following proposition, proved in the appendix.
Proposition 9. Assume there is heterogeneity in the distribution of disease risk among preventive consumers.
If yi is independent of xi , then πt > π p .
The proposition says that adding independently distributed income heterogeneity cannot reverse the bias
against preventives found in Proposition 2 when consumers were heterogeneous in disease risk alone. Although adding independently distributed income heterogeneity cannot reverse the bias against preventives,
it will reduce the bias as the next proposition, proved in the appendix, shows.
Proposition 10. Adding income heterogeneity that is distributed independently from the heterogeneity in
disease risk causes π p /πt to rise at least weakly (strictly for continuous distributions).

12

Next, consider the extreme case of positive correlation, letting yi be a deterministic function of xi that is
increasing. Ex ante, the two sources of private information compound each other; ex post one of them disappears. Because there is less private information ex post, treatments generate more revenue than preventives
as the next proposition, proved in the appendix, states.
Proposition 11. Assume there is heterogeneity in the distribution of disease risk among preventive consumers. If yi is an increasing function of xi , then πt > π p .
Thus far we have not uncovered a case in which the firm is biased against treatments. Such a case can
arise when income and disease risk are negatively correlated. This is easiest to see in the extreme case in
which xi and yi are inversely proportional: xi yi = zi = z for all i. In this case the demand for preventives
would be homogeneous across consumers, allowing a preventive monopolist to extract all social welfare—
the entire disease burden D. A treatment monopolist, on the other hand, cannot fully extract D if there is
nontrivial heterogeneity in yi . This leads all the results from Section 3 to flip. Preventives now deliver the
first best. As in Proposition 2, the firm is guaranteed to have a bias, only now against treatments. This
bias can be quantified and bounded as in Propositions 3–5, can be shown to depend on the skewness in
the distribution of yi as in Proposition 6, and can be connected to inefficient product development as in
Proposition 8.7
If the firm is able to discriminate on the basis of one of the combined sources of heterogeneity, then the
analysis is essentially identical to the case in which there is no heterogeneity in that variable. For example,
suppose consumers vary in both xi and yi but the firm is able to perfectly price discriminate on the basis
of yi . (Firms can accomplish a limited form of this sort of discrimination in an international context by
charging different prices across countries differing in their income levels.) The qualitative analysis from
Section 3 carries over to this case. Preventive and treatment revenue can be calculated for a given yi using
the conditional distribution FX|Y (xi |yi ) and then integrated over yi .

4.2. Harm Heterogeneity
In this subsection, we analyze of consumer heterogeneity in harm hi from the disease. We will model this
as an ex post source of private information, revealed to the consumer after he or she contracts the disease.
Conceptually, we are taking hi to be a fairly narrow measure of harm, mainly representing the severity of
the physical damage caused by the disease. Any aspect of harm that the consumer could predict ex ante
(e.g., lost income from a given period of sick leave) is assumed to be embodied in yi . Assume the consumer
learns hi upon contracting the disease but the firm only ever knows the distribution of hi in the population
(or cannot discriminate based on hi if it observes hi ).
Suppose hi is sole source of consumer heterogeneity. It is immediate that switching the source of private
information from xi ex ante to hi ex post flips the results from Section 3, just as the results were flipped in
the case of extreme negative correlation between disease risk and income (xi yi = z for all i).
7 There

is no analogue to Proposition 7 because yi does not have a natural upper bound as does the probability xi .

13

Next, consider combining heterogeneity in hi with other sources of heterogeneity. Begin by assuming
consumers are heterogeneous in xi and hi but have the same income, y. Assume first that xi and hi are
independent. Revenue from a preventive and treatment can be written respectively as
π p = max p p F̄X (p p /h)

(6)

πt

(7)

pp

= max xpt F̄H (pt )
pt

Applying a straightforward change of variables leads to the following proposition, proved in the appendix.
Proposition 12. Suppose xi and hi are distributed independently and that consumers have the same income
y. The firm earns more revenue from a preventive if and only if RX /x > RH /h and from a treatment if and
only if RH /h > RX /x.
To understand the proposition, recall the definition of x as the mean of the distribution of disease risk:
x=

R x̄
0

xi dFX (xi ) =

R x̄
0

F̄X (xi )dxi , where the last equality follows from integrating by parts. Because x is the

area under “demand curve” F̄X , it represents the potential rent that can be extracted from the market ex ante.
Recall the definition of RX as the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under F̄X , or in other
words the greatest rent that can be extracted from the market ex ante with a linear price. Hence RX /x is the
surplus extraction ratio for the ex ante period. Similarly, RH /h is the surplus extraction ratio for the ex post
period. The proposition says that when the sources of heterogeneity are independent, the surplus extraction
ratios for the ex ante and ex post periods can be computed in isolation. Whichever of the ratios is greater, the
product sold in the associated period generates more revenue. The proposition implies that the bias could
go either way in theory.
Next, consider the case in which hi is an increasing deterministic function of xi . The case turns out to
be similar to the one in which consumers are heterogeneous in xi and yi and yi is an increasing function of
xi . Arguments similar to the proof of Proposition 9 can be used to show that πt > π p . Next, consider the
case in which hi is inversely proportional to xi : xi hi = z for all i for some z. It is immediate that consumers
are homogeneous from an ex ante perspective, and so the whole disease burden D can be extracted with a
preventive. Heterogeneity in hi remains in the ex post period, so treatments will not be able to extract all of
D. Thus the firm’s bias is toward preventives. The results are the same as with heterogeneity in hi alone.
Moving to the remaining combination of sources of heterogeneity to be analyzed, suppose consumers
are heterogeneous in hi and yi but have the same disease risk, x. As before we will consider three cases:
independence, extreme positive correlation, and extreme negative correlation. If hi and yi are independent,
we have results analogous to Proposition 9 and 10, but with the inequalities flipped because the variable
combined with yi involves ex post rather than ex ante heterogeneity. Thus we have that adding independently
distributed heterogeneity in yi cannot reverse the firm’s bias against treatments found with heterogeneity in
hi alone but will reduce the bias.
The remaining cases in which hi is a deterministic function of yi —whether increasing or inversely
proportional—can be analyzed together. Indeed, if hi is any deterministic function of yi , the result will

be the same. Because the consumer knows yi ex ante and ex post, and knowledge of yi gives knowledge of
hi , consumers have the same private information ex ante and ex post. Thus just as the firm has no bias toward
either produce with heterogeneity in yi alone, it will have no bias in this case either, as the next proposition,
proved in the appendix, states.
Proposition 13. Assume that consumers have the same disease risk x, that they are heterogeneous in income
yi , and that harm hi is a deterministic function of yi . Then π p = πt .
The results in Proposition 13 do not mirror the analogous results for combined heterogeneity in xi and yi
when yi a deterministic function of xi . Whereas there is no bias toward either product under the conditions
of Proposition 13, when yi is a deterministic function of xi there can be bias; moreover, the direction of bias
depends on the slope of the function. The difference can be explained with reference to entropy, a measure
of uncertainty from information theory. With combined heterogeneity in xi and yi , the elimination of private
information in xi upon realization of disease status has a real effect on entropy facing firms. The direction of
the effect depends on the slope of the function linking yi to xi . On the other hand, when hi is a deterministic
function of yi , the realization of hi ex post does not change entropy because this information was already
completely embodied in yi .

4.3. Summary
Consideration of various sources of heterogeneity in various combinations with various correlation structures led to a rich set of results. For reference, the results are summarized in Table 1, organized by the
conditions generating a bias toward one product or the other.
Further progress can be made in digesting these results by determining which conditions are empirically
15

relevant for various actual diseases. For example, until the development of antiretrovirals, heterogeneity in
hi may have been less important for HIV than heterogeneity in infection risk. While the time of death varied,
HIV virtually always led to AIDS and ultimately death. Thus for HIV those cases that remain after putting
aside heterogeneity in hi —the starred entries in Table 1—would be of most empirical relevance.8
Focusing on just the starred entries, one can work through a decision tree to further narrow down the
relevant theoretical results. One could next ask whether heterogeneity in disease risk is likely to be important. If not, then the theory suggests that bias toward preventives or treatments will not be much cause
for concern. If there is substantial heterogeneity in disease risk, (as with HIV) then the next question is
the skewness in risk, which will affect the potential for bias. Finally, one can ask about the correlation of
disease risk and income in order to estimate the sign and magnitude of bias in R&D incentives between
preventives and treatments. Typically, firms will be biased toward treatments and against preventives unless
there is substantial negative correlation between risk and income. Indeed, this correlation is negative in the
case of HIV, so it is difficult to sign bias between treatments and preventives a priori. In our calibrations for
the case of HIV in Section 6, we will first try to measure the importance of heterogeneity in disease risk.
Then we will try to determine the direction and importance of the correlation of disease risk and income.
For other diseases, harm could be the most important source of heterogeneity. Polio is one possible
example. Before the development of the Salk vaccine in the 1950s, polio epidemics affected a wide swath of
the US population (Howard 2005); perhaps the most famous victim was President Franklin Roosevelt, whose
legs were paralyzed by polio. Only around 5% of polio infections result in any symptoms. Of the infections
resulting in symptoms, most result in a mild, flu-like illness. Only around 10% of the symptomatic infections (0.5% of total infections) result in severe nerve damage such as that suffered by Roosevelt (Mueller,
Wimmer, and Cello 2005).9 The entries in Table 1 that may be empirically relevant for polio, those involving
heterogeneity in hi but not xi , are marked with a dagger. The implied theoretical result for this case is that
if there is any bias at all it should be toward preventives, not treatments. Assuming that polio epidemics
were widespread, and not strongly correlated with income, the theory would suggest that firms would have
stronger R&D incentives for a polio vaccine than for a polio treatment. In fact, a preventive was developed
for polio (the Salk vaccine, followed by the Sabin vaccine), but as yet no good pharmaceutical treatments
8 The

case without substantial heterogeneity in hi may have more empirical relevance than is apparent at first glance. Recall
that hi is a fairly narrow definition of harm, embodying only those elements of harm severity that the consumer cannot predict until
contracting the disease. In some cases, harm varies with patient age, weight, or other patient characteristics that patients know
ex ante. For other diseases exhibiting substantial harm heterogeneity, patients must be treated before the presentation of severe
symptoms to avoid the harm from these symptoms. For example, syphilis eventually leads to blindness in about 15% of untreated
cases; however, blindness cannot be reversed by antibiotic treatments for syphilis (Euerle and Chandrasekar 2012). This sort of
heterogeneity would not be a source of private information for consumers in either the market for preventives or treatments and
thus would not generate a bias toward either product. Further, producers may be better able to discriminate if the heterogeneity
is in ex post harm rather than ex ante risk. The producer could offer different versions of the drug, targeting serious cases with a
high-priced version with either a high dosage or in a presentation that is suited to be administered in hospitals. In practice, the price
differentials can be huge: Lau et al. (2011) found that subject hospital paid from 35 to 240 times more for the intravenous than the
pill form for the drugs studied.
9 Whether this heterogeneity in eventual harm corresponds to heterogeneity in h in the sense relevant for the model would
i
depend on whether people have private information on heterogeneity in harm at the time of taking the treatment, and of course we
cannot know that since the treatment does not exist.

16

exist for the disease (Howard 2005). Of course, these outcomes could have been driven by the underlying
technological possibility set rather than differences in commercial incentives.

5. Alternative Purchasing Arrangements
In our benchmark model, consumers purchase pharmaceuticals directly from the manufacturer. In this
section, we extend the model to consider alternative purchasing arrangements. While we still consider
highly stylized environments, we argue some of the cases are useful for understanding policy.
Subsection 5.1 considers the case in which the manufacturer can offer an insurance plan for its product.
Our main finding is that such ex ante contracts for future product access benefit treatment more than preventive manufacturers because treatment manufacturers gain the additional option of selling either ex ante
or ex post, whichever is more profitable.
Subsection 5.2 considers the case in which a third party (HMO, insurer, or small-country government)
bargains with the firm over the bulk purchase of the product on behalf of a group of consumers. We first
consider the case in which the group of consumers is small enough that the purchaser does not consider
the impact on R&D incentives. By negotiating a nonlinear tariff with a pharmaceutical firm, the buyer can
reduce the deadweight loss associated with prices above marginal cost for marginal units. In Australia,
for example, consumer purchases of most pharmaceuticals are subsidized by the government through the
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; the program allows manufacturers the option to negotiate with government
officials over a nonlinear tariff via a Deed of Agreement (Australian Government Department of Health and
Ageing 2009). We will model the third party in these situations as seeking to maximize consumer surplus
and will take the set of consumers covered by the intermediary as exogenous to the structure of the contract
with the pharmaceutical firm (thus abstracting from adverse-selection issues). These assumptions fit the
Australian policy well; they also fit the case of employer-sponsored insurance plans in which coverage for
the disease in question is a small part of the benefits package (abstracting from any agency problems between
the ultimate consumer and third-party intermediaries).
Subsection 5.3 analyzes the complementary case of ex ante bargaining by a purchaser that represents
enough consumers that it seeks to influence R&D incentives. We will see that a third-party purchaser that
covers a large proportion of consumers would like to commit to bargaining before the firm sinks R&D costs
because this avoids a hold-up problem associated with ex post bargaining. We argue that the Advisory
committee on Immunization Practices in the U.S. and the Pneumococcus Advance Market Commitment
internationally many help play this role.

5.1. Insurance Contracts
Abstracting for the moment from the role of third-party intermediaries, we begin with a straightforward
extension of the model to allow the manufacturer to sell insurance for its products to the consumer rather
than selling the product directly. This alternative contractual form has no bearing on preventive sales because

17

preventives must be sold ex ante so function exactly like insurance in our model. Insurance can only make
a difference for treatment sales.
Suppose that a treatment manufacturer can offer a contract for future access to its product to consumers
ex ante, before their infection status is realized. We call this contract “insurance” here, but it can be any future contract. The possibility of offering insurance offers the treatment manufacturer the option of imitating
the strategy of a preventive manufacturer. Hence the treatment manufacturer is assured of earning at least as
much from its product as from a similarly effective preventive. This result holds even in cases identified in
Section 4 in which, in the absence of insurance contracts, treatments generated less producer surplus than
preventives, cases including private information about ex post harm and perfect negative correlation between
ex ante disease risk and income. The results of the previous sections could be reinterpreted as indicating
when the manufacturer would choose to sell its treatment—ex ante versus ex post—and when this choice
would result in social distortions.10
For reference, we conclude the subsection by cataloging the results involving insurance allowing for
general forms of heterogeneity. If ex ante consumer valuations are homogeneous, there will be no distortion
of R&D incentives: preventives can be used to appropriate the full social benefit even absent insurance;
treatments can achieve the same result via insurance contracts. If consumer valuations are heterogeneous ex
ante, R&D incentives for preventives will typically be suboptimal as we have discussed at length; insurance
has no bearing on these incentives. Incentives will also be suboptimal for treatments if ex post consumer
valuations are heterogeneous. Insurance can improve these incentives if selling the treatment ex ante via
insurance contracts is more profitable than direct sales of the treatment ex post.

5.2. Ex Post Bargaining with Third Parties
Next we turn to bulk purchases on behalf of a group of consumers by a purchaser that does not seek to, or
cannot, influence R&D incentives, for example an HMO, insurer, or small-country government. We model
this as a Nash bargain between the bulk purchaser and firm over sale of an existing product, with threat
points if bargaining breaks down given by the equilibrium with direct-to-consumer sales studied above. We
will see that distortions to R&D incentives found previously, even if they are attenuated, persist.
Formally, suppose the firm and buyer engage in Nash bargaining over the sale of product j after the
firm has decided which product to develop and has sunk its investment k j in R&D. Assume that the buyer’s
objective is to maximize consumer surplus. Consider a general form of Nash bargaining in which φ ∈ (0, 1)
indexes the firm’s share of the gains from bargaining. Then the firm’s ex ante equilibrium surplus from Nash
bargaining is
N j = Π j + φ[WF j − Π j − CS j ],

(8)

10 For the option to sell ex ante to be guaranteed not to reduce producer surplus requires the assumption that the treatment
manufacturer can commit to a price path. It if cannot commit, it may face the problem of a durable-good monopolist conjectured by
Coase (1970), whereby anticipated sales to low-value consumers ex post constrains how high prices can be ex ante. An interesting
set of asymmetries arises between treatments and preventives in the context of a durable-good monopoly, but we omit reporting
them here for space considerations.

18

i.e., the firm’s threat point from selling on the private market (Π j ) plus its share of the ex post gains from
moving to the first-best “pie” (WF j ) over and above the sum of parties’ threat-point surpluses (Π j for the firm
and CS j for the buyer). (Note that (8) is an ex ante surplus, reflecting the accounting convention of netting
out the sunk cost k j from all the firm’s payoff terms.) Substituting DWL j = WF j − WE j = WF j − (Π j + CS j )
into (8) yields N j = Π j + φDWL j . Thus the firm’s objective function with ex post buyer procurement is
its objective function with private procurement, Π j , plus a term reflecting its share of the deadweight loss
eliminated in ex post bargaining. The presence of this second term may mitigate the firm’s bias against
the product that extracts fewer surpluses on the private market but need not eliminate the bias. The results
should generalize to any bargaining structure in which the firm and bulk buyers each capture some share of
the deadweight loss under private purchases.
The fact that procurement by a bulk purchaser need not eliminate bias in the firm’s incentives is an
instance of the familiar hold-up problem (Klein, Crawford, and Alchian 1978). The firm decides which
product to develop before negotiating with the government. Recognizing that it does not appropriate all the
surplus in bargaining, the firm may distort its decision in order to appropriate more surplus. The literature
on the hold-up problem focuses on distortions at the intensive margin of how much to invest; in our setting,
the hold-up problem also leads to a distortion at the extensive margin of which product to develop.11

5.3. Ex Ante Bargaining with Third Parties
Now suppose that the firm and the third-party bulk purchaser bargain in advance of the development of
products instead of after. Suppose further that the bulk purchaser represents most consumers, so the revenue
it provides forms most of the firm’s producer surplus. It is straightforward to see that if the parties engage
in Nash bargaining (or another efficient bargaining process), they will now reach an efficient outcome. This
outcome can be implemented with a two-part tariff, with the bulk purchaser using a fixed fee to transfer
surplus to the manufacturer and then being able to purchase as many units as desired at marginal cost.
In the U.S. the de facto policies of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
provides something close to ex ante price setting. The ACIP analyzes the cost effectiveness of new vaccines,
recommending that a vaccine be added to the immunization schedule if its price falls below a threshold which
would make it cost effective. While the ACIP’s recommendations are not legally binding, they are almost
always followed in practice. Firms respond by pricing at this threshold. This policy effectively commits the
government to a price-setting procedure that ends up tying the price to the value generated by the vaccine.
(See Barder, Kremer, and Levine 2004, chapter 2, for a discussion of these examples.)
Another example of ex ante bargaining is provided by advance market commitment programs for vaccines of the type described by Kremer and Glennerster (2004). A pilot program was implemented for pneumococcal vaccine by a group of donors including the Gates Foundation, countries, and other sponsors. This
group committed to help finance purchase of pneumococcal vaccine still in development, covering strains of

and Zwiebel (1996), among others, identify a different extensive-margin distortion resulting from the hold-up problem,
in their case a distortion in the firm’s technology choice.

19

the disease common in developing countries at a price targeted to be between unit production cost and the
vaccine’s social value (see Snyder, Begor, and Berndt 2011 for description and analysis).
In summary, individual bargaining before infection status is realized can avoid some losses associated
with ex post heterogeneity in valuation (Subsection 5.1). Bargaining by an agent who maximizes welfare
of an exogenously defined group can avoid static losses (Subsection 5.2). If barganing takes place not
just before infection status is realized, but before R&D investments are sunk, any R&D distortions caused
by heterogeneity among consumers can be avoided (this subsection). In considering various purchasing
arrangements, all three subsections maintained the assumption of a monopolist pharmaceutical firm. Appendix B considers the effect of competition among manufacturers who obtained temporary monopoly when
they develop new products, showing that the prospect of competition from future generic treatments may
further reduce R&D incentives for preventives.

6. Calibrations for Sexually Transmitted Infections
The remainder of the paper turns from theory to measurement. We begin with calibrations illustrating how
to apply the model to assess whether firms may have biased R&D incentives for a particular disease for
which we have information on relevant sources of consumer heterogeneity. We focus on the case of HIV
because it is an important disease, we have reasonable proxies for the joint distribution of HIV disease risk
and income, and as argued in Section 4.3 HIV may exhibit less harm heterogeneity than some other diseases,
allowing us to focus on just disease risk and income heterogeneity for which we have better data.
Section 3 showed that heterogeneity in disease risk alone could lead firms to favor treatments over
preventives, while Section 4.1 showed that negative correlation between income and disease risk could potentially lead firms to favor preventives over treatments. Thus a bias towards either preventives or treatments
is possible a priori, with the direction and size of the bias depending on the joint distribution of disease risk
and income. The focus of this section will be on finding empirical measures of this joint distribution, first
for the U.S. market and then for the international market.
In Subsection 6.1 we use individual-level data for the U.S. market to calibrate revenue for an HIV
preventive and treatment. Revenue from the preventive is generally much lower than from the treatment,
only one quarter to one half as much, providing a potential contributing factor for the continued delay in
developing HIV vaccines relative to drugs. These results contrast with additional calibrations for HPV,
a much more common disease than HIV and with an infection-risk distribution that is consequently less
skewed. The calibrated revenue for an HPV preventive is close to that for a treatment, suggesting that firms
may have less bias against developing preventives for HPV.
In Subsection 6.2 we move from U.S. to cross-country data on the joint distribution of HIV risk and
income. These calibrations allow us to explore the effect of international price discrimination in the pharmaceutical market on relative incentives to invest in preventives. The calibrations suggest that restricting the
scope for international price discrimination could substantially reduce revenue from HIV drugs, possibly

6.1. U.S. Market
The U.S. pharmaceutical market is by far the world’s largest and is widely seen as the driver of firms’
R&D decisions. Several surveys report information on risk factors for HIV and other sexually transmitted
infections such as numbers of sexual partners. We will try several different approaches to mapping the
relationship between observed characteristics and disease risk and employ data from two different surveys.
Our first calibrations use nationally representative data on the lifetime number of sexual partners broken down by the individual’s gender and sexual orientation and the partners’ genders from the 1989–2004
General Social Survey (GSS) to calibrate the model of Section 3.12 The distribution of lifetime sexual partners is highly positively skewed: the median is 3 but the mean is 10.7. This skewness induces skewness in
the distribution of disease risk in our calibrations, which in turn leads to a large gap between the producer
surplus from a preventive and treatment.
Column (1) of Table 2 contains the results from calibrations that use GSS data and that account for
disease-risk heterogeneity but not income heterogeneity. The calibration labeled HIV1 involves a simple
linear mapping from lifetime sexual partners to infection risk with a constant probability of transmission
per partner. Figure 4 graphs the resulting inverse demand curve for this calibration. The positively skewed
distribution of disease risk produces a highly convex inverse demand curve. Recall π p is given by the area of
12 We

use the cleaned version of the GSS data used in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) among other studies. Income is based on
the family income variable interpolated as the median of the bands or, for top-coded observations, 1.25 times the top code. Other
top-code factors produced essentially the same results. Income is converted into 2004 dollars using the Consumer Price Index. We
label “lifetime sexual partners” the response to the survey question asking the number of sexual partners since age 18.

the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under the curve (the shaded rectangle in the figure) and πt by the
area under the curve. It is apparent that π p is much less than πt ; to be precise, π p /πt = 0.253. As shown in
the figure, the firm’s optimal strategy in this calibration turns out to be to sell the preventive at a high price
to a small segment of high-risk individuals.
In the row of calibrations labeled HIV2, we replace the simple linear model with a model due to Kaplan
(1990), in which a person with n sexual partners has probability 1 − (1 − β)n of ever contracting the disease,
where β is the probability of contracting the disease from any given partner. We take β = 0.06%, equal to
an estimate of the current HIV prevalence rate in the United States, which according to UNAIDS (2004) is
0.6%, times the average per-partner transmission rate, which following Rockstroh et al. (1995) we take to
be 10%. The estimated figure for π p /πt , 0.252, is quite similar to that from the linear model.13
In the row of calibrations labeled HIV3, we allow the β in the Kaplan model to vary by sexual orienta13 Results

tion,14 race,15 and intravenous (IV) drug use.16 These are important sources of disease-risk heterogeneity
in the population: our estimates suggest that HIV is over 60 times more prevalent among homosexual than
heterosexual males, eight times more prevalent among blacks than whites, and over 30 times more prevalent
among IV-drug users than others. Although one might expect these additional potential source of heterogeneity to reduce the relative profitability of preventives, in fact π p /πt increases from 0.252 to 0.316 in
column (1). The firm ends up concentrating its sales of the preventive among even higher-risk individuals
compared to the previous calibration. Although sales fall, the price can be increased enough that the overall
profitability for the preventive rises.
Columns (2) and (3) provide robustness checks. Column (2) repeats the calibrations from column (1)
for a single age cohort, 35 to 40 year olds. At the cost of a smaller sample size, the calibrations address the
potential concern that number of sexual partners may have different meanings for people in different age
cohorts because older cohorts have had a longer time to accumulate partners and also lived in environments
with different sexual norms. The producer-surplus ratio π p /πt increases slightly across calibrations from
column (1) to (2), for example from 0.253 to 0.260 for the linear model. Column (3) repeats the calibrations
from column (1) using a different data source for infection risk: the 2003–2004 National Health Examination
Survey (Centers for Disease Control 2005), or NHANES. The resulting producer surplus ratios are close to
their analogues in column (1).
Column (4) repeats the calibrations from column (1) allowing for heterogeneity in income along with
infection risk. The assumption from Section 4.1 are maintained: willingness to pay to avoid harm from the
disease is proportional to income (yi ) and price discrimination based on yi is impossible. An individual’s
demand for a preventive equals his or her disease risk xi multiplied by yi . Producer surplus from a preventive
is calculated as the rectangle of maximum area under this inverse demand curve. The demand curve for a
drug is constructed by ordering consumers by yi and then stepping off the expected drug quantity xi each
14 For the

male partners of males, we scale β up in two stages. We first multiply by 36.8, the estimated prevalence of HIV among
homosexual males relative to the general population, computed by taking the percentage of people living with HIV in 2004 who
contracted the disease from male-to-male contact—199,085 out of 462,792 cases in the 35 reporting states according to the Centers
for Disease Control (2006a)—and dividing by the percentage of homosexual males in the population, estimated to be 1.2% in our
GSS data. We further scale β by a factor of three to reflect the estimate from Royce et al. (1997) that HIV is three times more likely
to be passed between males than from males to females. For the rest of the sample, we scale β by 0.58, equal to the prevalence of
HIV among the population that is not homosexual male relative to the prevalence in the general population (including homosexual
males). Given the small number of bisexual males in the GSS sample, 0.2%, the results do not depend on how the transmission
rates for their male and female partners are treated (we allow for differential rates) and indeed are similar if bisexual males are
omitted from the calculations.
15 We take the β parameters which have been adjusted to reflect variation in infection risk by sexual orientation as described in
the previous footnote, and further scale them by 2.55 for African American, 0.324 for whites, and 1.00 for Hispanics, estimated
from statistics from the Centers for Disease Control (2006a). Implicit in this scaling is the assumption that an individual matches
with partners of the same race.
16 The GSS does not report IV drug use, so we resort to other data sources. A study of HIV prevalence among IV drug users in
U.S. drug treatment centers (Centers for Disease Control 2006b) found that HIV prevalence averaged 18% but varied across cities,
ranging from 1% in a Los Angeles to 36% in New York City. Coupled with an estimate of the total number of HIV cases due to
IV drug use from Centers for Disease Control (2006a), we can back out the total number of IV drug users in different infectionrisk categories and append simulated observations to the GSS data to represent the population of IV drug users. Since we do not
have information on income for IV drug users, for the calibration in column (4) we take their income to be the threshold for U.S.
Medicaid eligibility (75% of the $9,827 poverty line as of 2004).

23

consumer would buy at this reservation price. Comparing the results to column (1), we see that accounting
for heterogeneity in income about doubles the revenue ratio. Though the bias against preventives is reduced,
the calibrations in column (4) still suggest that the producer surplus from treatments is nearly twice that
from preventives.
Column (5) is similar to (4) but takes 0.4 as an empirical estimate of income elasticity of the willingness
to pay to avoid harm rather than the 1.0 implicitly used in column (4).17 Not surprisingly given that the
income elasticity in column (5) is about midway between the implicit value of zero in column (1) and one
in column (4), the revenue ratios in column (5) are about midway between those in columns (1) and (4).18
As a counterpoint to the calibrations for HIV, Table 2 adds a set of calibrations for a much more common
disease, HPV. These calibrations, labeled HPV1, are directly comparable to the HIV2 calibrations—both are
Kaplan models with fixed values of β—but β is increased from 0.06% to 13.5%.19 The ratio of preventive-totreatment producer surplus in the HPV1 calibrations is about double that for HIV2 across all five columns.
Indeed, the HPV calibrations including income heterogeneity come quite close to 1. With a disease as
prevalent as HPV, the disease risk cannot be very positively skewed, putting a bound on the discrepancy
between preventive and treatment revenue, as shown in Figure 3.

6.2. International Market
Firms currently have considerable ability to price discriminate across countries, but there is an active policy
debate on whether this ability should be curtailed—for example, in the contexts of parallel trade for pharmaceuticals within the European Union (Danzon 1998) or re-importation of Canadian pharmaceuticals in
the United States (Pecorino 2002). The calibration in this section suggests that the abolition of international
price discrimination would substantially reduce the profitability of drugs. The calibration also illustrates
the possibility raised in Section 4.1 that the bias against preventives can be reversed if disease risk xi and
willingness to avoid harm (as proxied by income yi ) are sufficiently negatively correlated and drug access
cannot be sold before disease status is realized.
17 Getzen (2000) surveys empirical studies of the income elasticity of health expenditures. For purposes of the table, we are
interested in the U.S. income elasticity of out-of-pocket expenditures. This is provided by the handful of studies using U.S. micro
data from an historical period when most of the population was uninsured. The 0.4 figure, estimated by Anderson, Collette, and
Feldman (1960) using 1953 data, is in the middle of the [0.2,0.7] range from these studies. Micro studies using data from the
modern era with more insured consumers find income elasticities near zero. Using such an income elasticity would generate the
same results in column (1).
18 It is also possible to calibrate the impact of government purchases. Consider a Medicaid program that has the firm and
government engage in Nash bargaining over the supply of product j to all consumers below a certain income threshold (say 75% of
the U.S. poverty line, the threshold for Supplemental Security Income eligibility) and that the firm sells to the rest of the consumers
as usual on the private market. The addition of this Medicaid program increases the reported revenue ratio for some calibrations
and decreases the ratio for others, but overall the changes are modest. For example, in the HIV3 calibration, the addition of the
Medicaid program increases ratio in column (4) from 0.571 to 0.611 and decreases the ratio in column (5) from 0.461 to 0.438.
19 This value of β is computed as the HPV prevalence rate times its transmission rate. Dunne et al. (2007) estimated the prevalence
among U.S. women of the HPV strains classified as posing a high cervical-cancer risk as 15.2%. Dunne et al. estimated the
prevalence of the four strains included in the Gardasil HPV vaccine as 3.4%, but the vaccine also offers cross-protection against
other high-risk strains (Ault 2007). Data from Hernandez et al. (2008) data imply an HPV transmission rate of 88.8%: of the 18
couples in which one partner had an HPV strain that the other did not at the beginning of their study, 16 ended up transmitting a
strain to the other.

Figure 5: Comparison of producer surplus from an HIV preventive to that from a treatment in international example with income heterogeneity and no price discrimination. (Axes scaled so that a unit of area
represents the same producer surplus in both panels.)
We consider the market as consisting of the entire world population and treat all individuals within
any given country as homogeneous, with the same income and chance of infection; the analysis could be
extended to allow for distributions of xi and yi within each country. We use country-level data on percapita GNP, population, and HIV prevalence to approximate our two sources of consumer heterogeneity.20
We approximate xi by the fraction of people within a given country that are HIV-positive and yi by percapita GNP. The correlation between xi and yi across countries is significantly negative at −0.13, raising the
possibility that π p > πt .
Figure 5 shows the inverse demand curve for an HIV preventive in the upper panel and for a treatment
in the lower panel. The demand curves are derived as explained in the previous subsection. The firm
maximizes preventive profit by charging the price that just induces consumers in the United States to buy and
strictly induces consumers in Switzerland, Swaziland, Namibia, the Bahamas, South Africa, and Botswana
to purchase the preventive. The profit-maximizing drug price just induces consumers in France to buy and
strictly induces consumers in 16 other countries to buy. The axes on the two panels of Figure 5 have been
scaled so that a unit of area in both represents the same revenue. The rectangle for the preventive is slightly
larger: π p /πt = 1.13.21
20 Population

data are 1998 data from World Bank (2000); per-capita GNP data are 1998 data calculated with the World Bank
Atlas method in 2000 U.S. dollars from World Bank (2000); HIV data are the estimated number of HIV-positive 0-to-49 year olds
at the end of 1999 by country from UNAIDS (2000).
21 As we did in moving from column (4) to (5) in Table 2, we can replace the implicitly assumed value of 1.0 for the income

25

The analysis suggests that impeding international price discrimination would diminish revenue from
an HIV treatment more than from a preventive, and in the extreme could reduce treatment revenue below
preventive revenue if treatment access cannot be sold before infection status is realized. Nonetheless, even
in the unlikely case of a policy that abolished international price discrimination entirely, there would be
an important sense in which the bias against preventives would persist. Although producer surplus from a
preventive is 1.13 times that from a treatment in our calibration, at equilibrium prices, social surplus from
a preventive is 1.31 times larger than from a treatment, and nearly five times as many lives would be saved
from a preventive as from a treatment. This is because it is privately optimal for the firm to target a treatment
only to high income countries. The deadweight loss from monopoly pricing is much larger with treatments
than preventives. Hence, the firm might develop a treatment even if a preventive would yield greater social
surplus and save many more lives.

7. Empirical Tests
The calibration in the previous section suggests that in the case of HIV (and other rare STIs), disease-risk
heterogeneity may substantially reduce R&D incentives for preventives (even in the presence of substantial
negative correlation between income and disease risk). In contrast, the model suggests no reason why
disease-risk heterogeneity would affect incentives for development of treatments (controlling for disease
prevalence and the joint distribution of disease risk with income and harm).
In this section we present a first-pass empirical test of whether disease-risk heterogeneity affects the
probability that vaccines (the preventives we study) and drugs (the treatment we study) have been developed
over the last century for a sample of about 100 infectious-disease-causing microorganisms. Since quantitative information on the distribution of disease risk is not systematically available for a cross-section of
diseases, we develop several proxies for heterogeneity and positive skewness in disease risk and combine
these proxies into a single indicator. Among others, the proxies include sexual transmission and concentration of risk in an identifiable subpopulation or subregion. To the extent that these proxies are imperfect
measures of the shape of the disease-risk distribution, the power of our tests will be reduced.
This indicator characterizing the disease-risk distribution is used as a right-hand-side variable in a model
of product (vaccine or drug) development. We use a linear probability model to study a 0–1 measure of
whether a product has been developed for a disease. The presumption underlying the model is that lucrative
products are more likely to be developed. We control for the type of organism causing disease (virus vs.
bacterium) because it is believed to be relatively easier technologically to develop vaccines rather than drugs
for viral disease and data on organism type is readily available.22
elasticity of health expenditures with an empirical estimate. The elasticity of 0.4 used above in the U.S. calibrations (see footnote 17)
will not be appropriate in the present international context because estimates of the elasticity across countries are generally much
greater than within country. The range of estimates from the handful of cross-country studies surveyed by Getzen (2000) is [1.2,1.4].
Using the 1.3 midpoint of this range, estimated by Newhouse (1977), leads to only a slight change in the value of π p /πt in the
calibration, from 1.13 to 1.18.
22 We limited attention to bacterial and viral diseases because all variation in the availability of products for other types of

Of course, many other factors are important determinants of product development, including ease of
the science involved, other cost factors, government subsidies, and as discussed in Section 4.2 particular
forms of harm heterogeneity. Lacking data on these factors, we will include them in the error term. We
see no particular reason to expect these factors to be systematically correlated with our indicator of risk
heterogeneity, but of course future research could seek to control for these factors.
The dataset was constructed by a team of research assistants including a senior medical student. A list of
disease-causing organisms was taken from Harpavat and Nissim (2001), a widely-used teaching reference
that covers the most clinically important organisms. This source provided summary information on type of
organism (bacterium, virus, parasite, fungus), available treatments, whether children or adults are disproportionately affected, sexual and insect transmission, etc.23 This information was only available for a subset
of 51 “notifiable” diseases as defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). We collapsed the resulting
time series on prevalence for each disease into a single number by taking the maximum prevalence over the
time series.

24

Two issues arise in using the restricted sample of CDC notifiable diseases. First, the restricted sample is
considerably smaller than the full sample. Second, it is not a randomly selected sample. Notifiable diseases
are significantly more likely to have had some product (vaccine or drug) developed for them than others,
presumably because they are associated with some factor that makes them a greater public-health concern
organisms (parasitic, fungal) would be captured by organism fixed effects.
23 This basic source was supplemented by the microbiology reference Mandell, Bennett, and Dolin (2009). Dates of product
development were compiled from Mandell, Bennett, and Dolin (2009), the dates of vaccine development supplemented by publichealth websites (Centers for Disease Control 2009, National Network for Immunization Information 2009, Immunization Action
Coalition 2009, U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2009) and the dates of drug development by medical histories (Corey, Kürti,
and Czakó 2007; Greenwood 2008). Historical data on disease prevalence was taken from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report (various dates, spanning 1944–2007).
24 We use the historical maximum to address the problem that a product’s introduction may reduce the disease’s prevalence,
inducing a correlation between the prevalence variable and the regression error. The maximum captures prevalence in the absence
of a drug or vaccine. The results are similar using alternative prevalence measures such as the mean over the period rather than the
maximum.

(greater prevalence, harm, or transmissibility). Our strategy will be to focus on the results from the full
sample but also report results for the restricted sample for robustness.
Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the dataset. The indicator for infection-risk heterogeneity
deserves special comment because it is the regressor of central interest. This indicator is set to 1 if a discrete
high-risk group could readily be defined from a review of the disease’s epidemiology and transmission
patterns. Specifically, the indicator is set to 1 if the disease satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
• sexually transmitted;
• transmitted by animal contact;
• chiefly affects a small population of either hospitalized patients, immuno-compromised individuals,
intravenous-drug users, or soldiers;
• organism has restricted ecological habitat (e.g., tropics for malaria).
Table 4 reports the results from a linear probability model, which regresses an indicator for product
(vaccine or drug) availability on infection-risk heterogeneity using ordinary least squares. Results from alternative specifications (probit, logit) are quite similar. Consider the results from the full sample in columns
(1)–(3) in which infection-risk heterogeneity is the only covariate. The –0.265 coefficient in the first row of
column (1) indicates that vaccines are 26.5 percentage points less likely to have been developed for diseases
28

with infection-risk heterogeneity, significant at the 1% level. The analogous coefficient in column (2) indicates that there is no statistically significant effect of infection-risk heterogeneity on drug development. The
difference between the vaccine and drug coefficients in column (3) indicates that infection-risk heterogeneity reduces vaccine development 26.2 percentage points more than it does drug development, a difference
significant at the 10% level.
The difference between the constant terms in column (3) indicates that vaccines are less common than
drugs, the average disease being 28.6 percentage points less likely to have a vaccine than a drug, significant
at the 1% level. This result may capture a host of factors besides heterogeneity in infection risk that may
make vaccines harder to market than drugs, such as tendencies for people to invest less on prevention or the
greater epidemiological externalities from vaccines.
One concern with results is that our infection-risk heterogeneity may be proxying for more than just
the shape of the risk distribution; it may be proxying for low overall disease burden, as diseases that are
transmitted through specialized vectors or concentrated in subpopulations may have an overall low prevalence. Virtually any theory would suggest that firms would have less of an incentive to develop products for
low-burden diseases, and so a significantly negative coefficient on our proxy may not be a dispositive test
of the particular theory in Section 3. This concern is partially addressed in the specification involving the
full sample by focusing not on the negative coefficient in the vaccine regression in isolation but on a comparison of the vaccine to the drug regression. If infection-risk heterogeneity were proxying for low overall
disease burden, one would expect to find a negative effect on drug development as well, but the coefficient
on infection-risk heterogeneity in column (2) is close to 0. The result in column (3), which can be viewed
as a difference-in-differences, indicates that our proxy is having a statistically significantly different effect
on vaccine than on drug development.
The concern is further addressed by the specification involving the restricted sample, reported in columns
(4)–(6), adding an explicit prevalence measure as well as other controls. The sample is restricted to the
subset of 51 notifiable diseases for which we have prevalence data. The results are if anything a bit stronger
than in the full sample, with infection-risk heterogeneity decreasing the probability of vaccine development
by a statistically significant 40.0 percentage points, but having essentially no effect on drug development,
resulting in a differential effect on vaccines vs. drugs reported in column (6) of 35.5 percentage points, now
significant at the 5% level.
The additional controls in column (4)–(6) regressions are of some independent interest. Vaccines are
significantly more likely to be developed for diseases that disproportionately affect children and drugs significantly less likely. This is consistent with the lower cost of delivery of vaccines that can be integrated into
childhood immunization programs. Viral diseases show the same pattern consistent with the widespread
view among scientists, that the technology of vaccine production is particularly suitable for viruses. The
prevalence measure does not show up as important in any regression. One explanation is that the restricted
sample, including as it does only diseases listed as notifiable by the Centers for Disease Control, already
selects for diseases with high aggregate health burden, so that within this group, and prevalence and harm
29

may be negatively correlated across diseases.25
We also tested the hypothesis by running a Cox proportional hazards model on the date (from 1945 to
present) of product development. In the specification using the full sample, infection-risk heterogeneity cuts
the hazard of vaccine development by more than two-thirds but does not reduce the hazard of drug development. The reduction in vaccine hazard is significantly larger than the reduction in the drug hazard at the 5%
level. In the specification restricting the sample to CDC notifiable diseases with information on prevalence
and other variables (using the full panel of prevalence data for that variable), infection-risk heterogeneity
leads to a similar reduction in the hazard of vaccine development as in the specification involving the full
sample. There is now also some evidence it reduces the hazard of drug development (at the 10% level). The
point estimate implies that infection-risk heterogeneity reduces the vaccine hazard by twice as much as the
drug hazard. Due to large standard errors in the specification using the restricted sample, the reduction in
the vaccine hazard is not significantly different from the reduction in drug hazard. Overall, the results from
both the linear-probability and hazard models are consistent with the idea that infection-risk heterogeneity
reduces incentives to develop vaccines.

8. Conclusion
In this paper, we argued that time-varying sources of private information for consumers, combined with
differences in the timing of when preventives and treatments are administered, may affect firms’ ability to
extract consumer surplus under direct sales to consumers. Thus the wedge between private and social R&D
incentives will be different for preventives than for treatments.
We focus on a benchmark model in which a monopolist sells directly to consumers, but also consider
extensions to other environments. If consumers vary only in their disease risk, a monopolist can extract less
revenue from preventives—which are sold when consumers still have private information about their disease
risk—than from treatments which are sold after consumers’ disease status is realized, at which point there
is no heterogeneity among those with positive valuation. We showed that the firm’s bias toward treatments
is likely to be largest for diseases with a right-skewed risk distribution, i.e., diseases with much of the risk
concentrated in a small segment of the population. Thus biases against vaccines are more likely for sexually
transmitted infections than infections with airborne transmission, for example.
We then broadened the analysis to encompass other sources of consumer heterogeneity with different
timing structures. If consumers are initially homogeneous but learn about how severely they are affected by
the disease only after contracting it ex post, then the benchmark results are reversed. Treatment manufacturers will not be able to fully extract consumer surplus, but preventive manufacturers will.
Allowing firms to sell insurance contracts for their products creates a potentially valuable option for a
25 Consistent with this explanation, we ran a regression similar to the specification in columns (4)–(6) but using the full sample of
91 observations and replacing the prevalence variable with an indicator for CDC-notifiable diseases. This indicator was quite often
large, positive and statistically significant. We prefer the specification reported in columns because it involves a more homogeneous
set of diseases and because the omitted CDC-notifiability indicator may be endogenous, in particular if the CDC is more likely to
require notification for diseases that are part of immunization programs.

treatment manufacturer, which can choose to sell treatment insurance ex ante (before the disease is contracted) or continue just selling the treatment ex post. The option is worthless for a preventive manufacturer,
whose product already functions like insurance because it is administered ex ante.
A rich set of additional results came from analyzing various combinations of sources of consumer heterogeneity. For example, allowing consumers to vary in income in addition to disease risk may reverse the
benchmark result that treatment exceeds preventive revenue found when consumers were heterogeneous just
in disease risk. This reversal only obtains under certain conditions: the correlation between income and disease risk must be sufficiently negative; the firm cannot be able to price discriminate on the basis of income
or to offer insurance contracts for treatments sold in advance of consumers learning their disease status.
Bargaining by bulk purchasers, such as HMOs, insurers, or governments, can address static monopoly
pricing distortions, but if this bargaining occurs after product development, bulk purchases reduce but do not
eliminate gaps between private and social incentives for product development. The manufacturer cares about
the outcome on the private market because this is its threat point in negotiations with the bulk purchaser.
In contrast ex ante price setting, as in the de facto operation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization,
practices in the U.S., or under Advance Market Committments internationally, could provide optimal R&D
incentives.
As discussed in Appendix B, an extension incorporating competition between a preventive and a treatment as well as later generic entrants suggests an additional bias against preventives. Future entry of generic
treatments constrains the pricing of preventives, but treatment pricing is unaffected by competition from
preventives.
A calibration using estimates of the joint distribution of income and HIV risk in the United States suggests that an unconstrained monopolist would find it optimal to sell even a costless vaccine with no side
effects at a high price to a small fraction of the population, and would earn only about half the revenue obtained by a treatment manufacturer. In contrast, for HPV, vaccine revenue would almost equal drug revenue.
The difference is that HIV is rare enough that the skewness in number of sexual partners generates skewness
in HIV infection risk while HPV is so prevalent that it is mathematically impossible for HPV infection risk
to exhibit much skewness. Although many other factors are involved, this may be a contributing factor (i)
for why a preventative was developed for HPV more quickly than for HIV; (ii) for why when a preventative
was developed for HIV, it was based on an existing treatment, and (iii) for why there was an eight year lag
between the time the manufacturer completed the FDA approval process for Truvada as treatment and as a
preventative.26 Truvada is expected to continue selling at a high price and to be used as a preventive only by
a small segment of people with extreme HIV risk (Grady 2012); its use as a preventive was thus not regarded
by the Gilead CEO as a "significant commercial opportunity” (Fey Cortez and Bennett 2011).
Calibrations for HIV revenue in the international market suggest that eliminating price discrimination
26 An HPV vaccine, Gardasil, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 but an HIV preventive was
not approved until 2012. Based on the trials conducted by the manufacturer, the FDA approved Truvada first as an HIV treatment
in 2004 but did not approve its use in a daily regimen to protect healthy individuals from HIV infection until 2012.

across countries would substantially reduce incentives to develop HIV drugs but would have much less effect
on incentives for vaccine development.
As an empirical test of the model, using a novel dataset on infectious diseases, we regressed indicators
for whether drugs or vaccines have been developed on an indicator for heterogeneity in disease risk, which
we constructed from underlying proxies, along with other controls. In line with the basic theory, we found
vaccines are significantly less likely to have been developed for diseases with heterogeneity in infection risk,
such as STIs, but we found no similar effect for drugs.
One important topic for future work is extending the benchmark model to examine the ways in which
these effects play out under the range of realistic institutional features of health-care markets, such as
employer-sponsored health care plans, government subsidies, rules allowing patients to consume pharmaceuticals only on doctors’ advice/prescription, technological advances improving the flow of information
or the accuracy of testing, etc. Related to these latter issues, our model raises the paradoxical possibility
that improvements in consumer medical information—whether from more physician attention, advertising
and public-health campaigns, freer access to medical information over the internet, or advances in testing
technologies—may increase heterogeneity in perceived disease risk and thus reduce firms’ incentives to
develop preventives, potentially reducing welfare. For example, consider the case of new genetic screens
for breast cancer. While the lifetime risk of breast cancer is about 12% in the U.S. population of women,
the risk rises to 60% among those for whom genetic testing reveals a harmful mutation in the BRCA1 or
BRCA2 genes (National Cancer Institute 2009), and correspindingly falls among those found not to have
this mutation. It is well understood that genetic testing can exacerbate adverse selection in insurance markets
(see, e.g., Oster et al. 2010, which documents increased take-up of long-term care insurance for individuals who test positive for the Huntington-disease gene). Our model suggests another channel for genetic
testing to reduce welfare, possibly reducing firms’ incentives to invest preventives by increasing perceived
heterogeneity in diesease risk.
This paper has suggested one factor (disease-risk heterogeneity) that reduces incentives to develop HIV
vaccines. A companion paper (Kremer, Snyder, and Williams, 2012) builds an integrated economic and
epidemiological model to investigate a different factor: by reducing disease transmission, vaccines have a
positive externality not present with existing treatments. The companion paper finds that the externality
is particular large for rare diseases. Because firms do not appropriate the externality, it ends up reducing
their profits and R&D incentives. Holding constant the total burden of disease, firms will find developing
preventives for common but less serious diseases like the flu more profitable than for rarer but more deadly
diseases. Since HIV is rare in the high-income countries that account for the bulk of pharmaceutical revenue,
the model suggests that firms will be able to capture a greater fraction of the social value of HIV drugs than
of HIV vaccines. Hence both the present and companion paper suggest incentives for R&D on HIV vaccines
may be suboptimal.
The market distortions against vaccine development we discuss could potentially be corrected through
subsidies to HIV vaccine R&D beyond those for pharmaceutical R&D in general (as under the International
32

AIDS vaccine initiatives), or through Advance Market Commitments to purchase vaccines if they are developed (Kremer and Glennerster 2004). To the extent that policymakers are uncertain about the scientific
feasibility of producing an HIV vaccine, and potential vaccine developers have private information about
the probability of success, Advance Market Commitments may be particularly attractive.

πt − π p ≥ kt − k p equals πt − π p . Equation (A11) follows from
dividing numerator and denominator through by πt and noting
D/πt = 1 since the firm can extract 100% of social welfare with
a treatment so that πt = D. Since CS p ≥ 0, (A11) at least weakly
exceeds (A8). Equation (A11) is non-negative by Proposition 2.
Hence (A5) equals (A11). Q.E.D.

is developed in the first best, then WEt = D − kt = WFt = WF ≥
WE p . Thus if ` = t, then j = t as well. But then WFt − WEt = 0,
implying that the term in braces in (A4) equals zero for ` = t. We
will see below that the term in braces in (A4) is non-negative for
` = p, so we can restrict attention to maximizing the term in
braces in (A4) over ` = p, which leaves the two possible terms
in braces in (A5). Manipulating the first braced term from (A5):

We will choose these 2C parameters so that π p /πt is very close
to 1/C. We will do this by having the risk-class masses {mc}Cc=1
decline geometrically and arranging the risk-class probabilities
{xc}Cc=1 so that the firm is indifferent between serving all consumers with a low price for the preventive than serving a smaller
group with higher prices.

charging a price hxc and selling the preventive to risk classes c
and higher. The right-hand side is the profit from charging a
price hxc+1 and selling to risk classes c + 1 and higher. It is easy

34

to see that the risk-class probabilities respect constraint (A14).
From equation (2), we have πt = ∑Cc=1 hmc xc. By construction
implicit in (A16), we have π p = hx1 ; that is, it is weakly most
profitable to charge hx1 for the preventive and sell to all consumers. Thus,

yields B as the value of the objective function (A26), that it respects constraint (A27), and that it satisfies conditions (A22)–

Proof of Proposition 8: For a treatment, Πt = WEt = WFt .
Since the firm extracts all social surplus with a treatment, the
firm always develops a treatment if it is socially efficient (by
either social-welfare measure WEt or WFt ) to do so.
For a case in which WE p > WEt but Πt > Π p , suppose xi is
uniformly distributed on [0,1]; k j = 1/8 for j ∈ {p,t}; c j = s j =
0 for j ∈ {p,t}; h = 1; e p = 1; and et = 5/8. For a treatment,
we have Πt = et x − kt = (5/8)(1/2) −1/8 = 3/16 = WEt = WFt .

xi = g−1 (yi ). Integrating over types gives the producer-surplus
expression. Equation (A45) holds because g−1 is an increasing
function, so xi ≥ g−1 (ŷi) for yi ≥ ŷi . Equation (A46) is a straightforward calculation. Equation (A47) follows from (A43). The

Proof. To prove part (i), a treatment is always developed if it
is socially efficient to do so because a treatment extracts 100%
of social surplus. The proof of Proposition 8 provides a case in
which a treatment is developed but it would have been socially
efficient to develop a preventive. The proof of part (ii) is similar
to Proposition 3 with the added fact that the supremum is generated by setting c j = s j = 0 and e j = 1 for j ∈ {p,t}, the values
that happen to be assumed in Proposition 3. Part (iii) follows

Appendix B: Extension Allowing for
Entry of Competitors
The text focused on the case of a monopoly manufacturer of
perfectly safe, effective, and costless pharmaceuticals. In this
appendix, we first extend the model to allow for more general
product characteristics. We then allow for the possibility of entry of competitors. We do this in the context of an oligopoly
model incorporating some realistic institutional features. In particular, the patent system in the model provides only temporary
monopoly power to a firm that develops a new product, after
which there is generic entry. The main results in the text largely
carry over to this extension. We do find a new source of bias
against preventives which is engendered by competition.
General Parameters: It is useful to first relax the assumption
that all products are perfectly safe and effective and costless
to manufacture. This makes it possible to consider the case in
which the social benefit of preventives and treatments may differ. We will show that the key welfare results from Section 3
continue to hold in this more general setting. Let c j ∈ [0,∞) be
the present discounted value of the marginal cost of manufacturing product j ∈ {p,t} and administering it to a consumer. Let
e j ∈ [0,1] be the efficacy of product j—the probability that product j prevents the consumer from experiencing harm from the
disease. Let s j ∈ [0,1] be the expected harm of side effects from
product j—the probability that a consumer experiences side effects multiplied by the present discounted value of the harm from
the side effects conditional on experiencing them.
Proposition 14. The key welfare results from Section 3 continue
to hold for general values of the parameters c j ∈ [0,∞), e j ∈
[0,1], and s j ∈ [0,∞).
i. The firm never develops a preventive in preference to a
treatment unless it is socially efficient to do so. There
exist cases in which the firm develops a treatment but it
would have been socially efficient to develop a preventive.
ii. 1 − π p /πt provides a tight upper bound on social cost
supk j ,c j ,e j ,s j [(WF − WE)/D].

Modeling Entry: To allow for generic entry, we extend the
model of Section 2 to an overlapping-generations setting. In period 0, N firms with the research capacity to develop new products sequentially decide whether to expend fixed cost k j and develop one product j or not to enter. Each period t = 1,2,...
thereafter, the old generation from t − 1 (Ot−1 ) dies, the young
generation from t − 1 (Yt−1 ) becomes old (Ot ), and a young generation (Yt ) with distribution of disease risk F(xi) is born. To
simplify the analysis, we will focus on one source of heterogeneity, disease risk, and abstract away from other sources of
heterogeneity such as income. Consumers have the following
life cycle: young consumers first learn of their disease risk, decide whether or not to purchase the preventive if one is available,
and then turn old; old consumers contract the disease or not, decide whether or not to buy a treatment if infected, and then die.
Let δ ∈ [0,1] be the per-period discount factor.
The first firm to develop a product enjoys patent protection for one period. After product j goes off patent, a fringe
of generic manufacturers enter, and price falls to marginal cost
c j . Besides delaying generic entry, the patent prevents others of
the N research-capable firms from developing the same product.
(Even if a second firm were able to invent a “me-too” substitute around the first firm’s patent for product j, in equilibrium
the second firm would not develop the “me-too” product if competition between them were intense enough to reduce producer
surplus below the development cost k j .) Thus, we can restrict attention to at most a first and second mover, which must develop
different products.
In this model, competition between a preventive and a treatment is asymmetric. Competition from a preventive does not reduce the profits of the treatment patenter, which makes its profits
from sales to the infected among the initial old generation O1 . It
is too late for these consumers to receive a preventive, and they
will die before generic version of treatments become available.
On the other hand, competition from a treatment does reduce
the profits of the preventive patenter. The preventive patenter
makes its profits from sales to the initial young generation Y1 .
The treatment is a substitute product for these consumers: rather
than buying the preventive, they can wait to see if they become
infected and buy the treatment. This competition effect is amplified because the generation Y1 consumers will not only have
access to the patented treatment but also will benefit from competition from generics that follow, driving treatment prices to
marginal cost.

37

Equilibrium: To derive the equilibrium of this model, first
consider the firm’s profit from developing a treatment. Let Πt be
the single-period monopoly profit from a treatment. Extending
(2) to allow for general parameter values, it can be shown that
Πt = (et h − st − ct )x − kt . In the competition model, the firm earns
Πt as well, whether its rival produces a preventive or does not
enter. The firm earns this Πt by serving the infected in generation O1 . It earns zero flow profit serving subsequent generations
because of generic entry.
A firm’s profit from developing a preventive depends on
what its rival does. If its rival does not enter, the present value
of its profit stream, denoted Π p0 , has the same functional form
as Π p from equation (1), but where the cutoff type indifferent
between buying and not changes from x̂(p p) = p p /h to x̂(p p ) =
(p p + s p)/(δe p h). The preventive developer earns this Π p0 from
selling to consumers in generation Y1 . The discount factor δ
inserted in the new formula for x̂(p p ) reflects the fact that the
benefit to consumers in generation Y1 from consuming the preventive is the harm avoided in the next period when they become
generation O2 . The preventive developer earns zero flow profit
serving subsequent generations because of generic entry. If the
rival develops a treatment rather than not entering, the preventive developer’s profit is lower because consumers in generation
Y1 anticipate cheap generic treatments will be available when
they become generation O2 . The present value of the preventive
developer’s profit stream, denoted Π pt , again has the same functional form as Π p in equation (1), but now the formula for the
cutoff type is
x̂(p p ) =

pp + sp
.
δe p [ct + st + (1 − et )h]

(B1)

Equation (B1) comes from equating the surplus the marginal
preventive consumer in generation Y1 obtains if he/she buys the
preventive to that if he/she waits until the next period and buys
the treatment at price ct if he/she becomes infected. Equation
(B1) accounts for the fact that a consumer of the preventive has
the option of getting the treatment in the next period if the preventive turns out to be ineffective. Again, the preventive developer earns zero flow profit serving subsequent generations because of generic entry.
Entry decisions in the subgame-perfect equilibrium can be
characterized as follows. If Π pt > Πt > 0, the first mover develops a preventive and the second mover a treatment. If Πt >
Π pt > 0, the first mover develops a treatment and the second
mover a preventive. If Πt > 0 > Π pt , the first mover develops a
treatment and the second mover does not enter. If Π p0 > 0 > Πt ,
the first mover develops a preventive and the second mover does
not enter. If 0 > max(Πt ,Π p0 ), neither firm enters. Ignoring
knife-edge cases Πt = 0, Π p0 = 0, and Π pt = 0, equilibrium
entry decisions can be neatly summarized: a treatment is developed (either alone or together with a preventive) if and only if
Πt > 0; a preventive is developed (either alone or together with
a treatment) if and only if (a) Π pt > 0 or (b) Π p0 > 0 > Πt .
The next proposition formalizes the notion that competition
adds a new effect biasing firms in favor of treatments and against
preventives.
Proposition 15. The existence of N ≥ 2 competing firms in the
model enlarges the set of parameters for which a treatment is de-

veloped and reduces the set of parameters for which a preventive
is developed compared to a model in which a single researchcapable firm makes both sequential development decisions.
Proof. Compare the present model involving competition between preventives and treatments, which we will label Model 1,
to the monopoly model laid out in the statement of the proposition, which we will label Model 2. We begin by proving two
facts that will be useful later in the proof. Fact 1 is that Πb , the
monopolist’s profit from developing both products, equals Πt +
Π pt . Conditional on developing both, the monopolist’s optimal
pricing strategy is to charge a treatment price maximizing profit
from sales to generation O1 , yielding marginal profit Πt , and
charging a price for the preventive that maximizes profit from
sales to generation Y1 given generics will enter the treatment
market, yielding marginal profit Π pt . Fact 2 is that Πb ≤ Πt +
Π p0 . This holds because Π p0 ≥ Π pt because of the businessstealing effect between preventives and treatments due to their
substitutability.
Suppose the parameters are such that a treatment is not developed in equilibrium in Model 1. According to the paragraph
preceding the proposition, we must have Πt < 0. (We ignore
knife-edged cases such as Πt = 0 throughout the proof for simplicity. It is easily seen that the proof holds for these cases as
well.) But Πt < 0 implies Πb < Π p0 by Fact 2, in turn implying
max(Πt ,Πb ) < max(Π p0 ,0), and so a treatment would not be
developed in equilibrium in Model 2.
Suppose the parameters are such that a preventive is developed in equilibrium in Model 1. According to the paragraph preceding the proposition, either (a) min(Πt ,Π pt ) > 0 or (b) Π p0 >
0 > Πt . If (a) holds, then by Fact 1, Πb = Πt + Π pt > Πt > 0.
Thus, max(Π p0 ,Πb ) > max(Πt ,0). Thus a preventive is developed in equilibrium in Model 2. If (b) holds, then again
max(Π p0 ,Πb ) > max(Πt ,0), and so a preventive is developed
in equilibrium in Model 2.
The proof is completed by constructing a case in which a
treatment is developed in equilibrium in Model 1 but a preventive is developed in equilibrium in Model 2. Let consumers be
homogeneous, with xi = 1 for all i. Let δ = e p = 1. Let c j = s j =

0 for j ∈ {p,t}. Let kt < et h and k p ∈ (1 − et)h,(1 − et )h + kt .
It can be shown that Πt = et h − kt > 0, Π p0 = h − k p , and Π pt =
(1 − et )h − k p < 0. According to the paragraph preceding the
proposition, since Πt > 0 > Π pt , a preventive alone is developed
in equilibrium in Model 1. Since k p < (1 − et )h + kt , Π p0 > Πt .
Hence Π p0 > Πt > Πt + Π pt = Πb , where the last step holds by
Fact 1. Thus, a preventive alone is developed in equilibrium in
Model 2. Q.E.D.
The logic behind Proposition 15 is that a monopolist would
internalize the negative business-stealing effect that treatments
exert on preventives arising because products are substitutes.
There exist cases in which a monopolist would not develop the
treatment in order to keep preventive profit high, while a competing firm would develop the treatment since it does not care
about preventive profits, and in some of these cases drug entry
deters entry of a preventive.
The competition effect identified in Proposition 15 may be
socially costly, as the next proposition states.

38

Proposition 16. In the competitive model, social welfare never
falls with a reduction in the cost of developing a preventive, k p ,
but may fall with a reduction in the cost of developing a treatment, kt .
Proof. All of the direct and indirect effects of reducing k j on
social welfare are non-positive except possibly for one: the possibility of deterring entry by the other product. In the text, we
established that a treatment will be developed if Πt > 0, independent of the preventive’s entry decision, and thus independent
of k p . So reducing k p weakly increases social welfare.
The proof is completed by demonstrating a case in which a
reduction in kt reduces social welfare. Let consumers be homogeneous, with xi = 1 for all i. Let
 e p = 1. Let c j = s j = 0 for
j ∈ {p,t}. Let k p ∈ (1 − et )h,h . We will compare the case in
which kt is high, namely kt ∈ (et h,∞), to a case in which kt is
low, namely kt = 0. In the first case, Πt = et h − kt < 0. Further,
Π p0 > 0. But, as noted in the text preceding Proposition 15,
Π p0 > 0 > Πt implies that a preventive alone is developed. The
present discounted value of the stream of social welfare in equilibrium is
δh
− k p.
(B2)
1−δ
In the second case, Πt = et h − kt = et h > 0. Further, Π pt =
(1 − et )h − k p < 0. But, as noted in the text preceding Proposition 15, Πt > 0 > Π pt implies that a treatment alone is developed. The present discounted value of the stream of social
welfare in equilibrium is
et h
− kt .
1−δ

(B3)

The limit as δ → 1 of the ratio of expression (B2) to (B3) equals
1/et . Thus, for δ sufficiently close to one, both kt and social
welfare are higher in the first than the second case. Q.E.D.
The intuition behind Proposition 16 is that a reduction in kt
increases the incentive to develop a treatment, which may deter the entry of preventives, even some preventives that generate
more social surplus than the treatment. As noted, competition
between preventives and treatments is asymmetrically tougher
on preventives, so preventives do not have a similar competitive
effect on treatments.
