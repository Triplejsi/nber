Why do emerging markets liberalize capital outflow controls? Fiscal versus net capital flow
concerns

NBER Working Paper No. 18879
March 2013, Revised June 2013
JEL No. F3,F31,F32,F36,F6
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the factors that motivated emerging economies to
change their capital outflow controls in the recent decades. Liberalization of capital outflow controls
can allow emerging market economies (EMEs) to reduce net capital inflow (NKI) pressures, but may
cost their governments the fiscal revenues that external financial repression generates. Our results
indicate that external repression revenues in EMEs declined substantially in the 2000’s compared with
the 1980’s. In line with this decline in external repression revenues and their growth accelerations
in 2000’s, concerns related to net capital inflows took predominance over fiscal concerns in the decisions
to liberalize capital outflow controls. Emerging markets facing high volatility in net capital inflows
and higher balance sheet exposures liberalized outflows less. Countries eased outflows more in response
to higher net capital inflows, higher appreciation pressures in the exchange market, higher real exchange
rate volatility and greater accumulation of reserves.

Introduction

Recent years have seen a re-emergence of the policy debate on the appropriateness of capital
controls. Opponents of capital controls argue that these controls can lead to local and global
misallocation of resources, perpetuate global imbalances (by allowing countries to maintain
undervalued real exchange rates) and encourage corruption. Further, opponents of capital
controls argue that in the empirical literature these controls have been found to be of limited
effectiveness in stemming net capital inflows (NKI). Proponents of capital controls have argued
that capital controls are macro-prudential measures and an optimal response to distortions in
financial markets (for example herd behaviour, too-big-to-fail, etc.). These controls are deemed
to be an important tool to prevent the build-up of financial sector risks and to reduce the damage
associated with sudden stops.2 Adding fuel to the debate, the IMF has softened its longstanding
opposition to capital controls, and now suggests that such controls may be a valid tool of
macroeconomic and macroprudential management when other tools have been exhausted (IMF,
2011a).
The debate on what emerging market economies (EMEs) should or should not do has two key
missing elements. The first is a fact-based analysis of the macroeconomic and financial pressures
that EME policymakers most often respond to when imposing capital controls. The empirical
literature assessing emerging market motivations for capital controls is scant.3 The second
missing element in the debate is a discussion of the use of capital outflow controls as a potential
response to NKI pressures. Most of the recent policy debate has focused on tightening of capital
inflow controls in response to surges in net capital inflows.4 However, because NKI are the
difference between capital inflows and outflows, countries that have existing outflow controls
have another potential tool to reduce NKI - the liberalization of outflows.5 This tool was
discussed in the literature on managing capital flows of the 1990’s (see Laban and Larrain,
1997), but it has been missing from the recent debate. Recent research in Pasricha (2012)
documents that in 22 EMEs between 2004 and the onset of the 2008 financial crisis, outflow
controls were liberalized more frequently than inflow controls were tightened. The pre-2008
crisis period saw a surge in net capital inflows to EMEs of a magnitude comparable to the post-

measures that a country may take to smooth cross-border capital flows should not be interpreted as capital controls
but 'macro-prudential policies'.” Factbox – South Korean Policymakers’ remarks on capital controls, Reuters, 12
November, 2010.

Recent work by Fratzscher (2012) examines this question for overall capital account openness in a broad sample of
emerging and advanced economies over the period 1984-2009. He finds that foreign exchange policy objective and
overheating concerns have been the two main motives for capital controls, particularly since 2000.

NKI are measured as the difference between inflows by non-residents and net outflows by residents. Therefore
both lower net inflows by non-residents and higher net outflows by residents would lead to a decline in NKI.

2008 crisis surge, yet inflow tightening measures became a primary tool of restricting NKI only
after the crisis.
The use of outflow liberalization in NKI management policy can be constrained by the fact that
outflow controls exist not only for reasons of managing capital flows but also to keep the
government’s borrowing costs low by keeping domestic savings at home. Sustained outflow
controls often form a part of a web of regulations on the domestic financial sector (for example,
interest rate ceilings, high reserve requirements, directed lending, etc.) that constitute “financial
repression”. These regulations seek to further reduce the cost of government borrowing and to
allocate savings to preferred sectors. Capital outflow controls help prevent capital flight in
response to domestic regulations, and therefore are a key ingredient of financial repression. The
revenues from financial repression can be substantial. Giovannini and de Melo (1993) showed
that for some 24 emerging and developing economies over the period 1972-87, revenues from
external repression averaged 1.4% of GDP. These considerations suggest that the decision to
liberalize outflow controls in response to surging inflows could involve weighing the benefits of
reduced NKI against the loss of revenues from financial repression.
In this paper, we provide evidence on EME motivations for capital outflow policy by examining
fiscal and macroeconomic factors at the time when outflow controls were liberalized. We address
the two gaps in literature identified above by focussing on capital outflow controls and by
providing a positive analysis of outflow policy changes. To accomplish this, we build two novel
datasets. First, we extend the dataset presented in Pasricha (2012) to cover the period 2001-2010.
This dataset comprises all changes in capital account regulations in 22 large EMEs and therefore
provides a de-jure assessment of capital controls.6 Second, we estimate the revenue from
external financial repression which, following Giovannini and de Melo (1993), is defined as the
fiscal revenue obtained by preventing residents from freely investing abroad. It is measured as
the difference between (effective or ex-post) external and domestic interest rate on government
debt, times the government’s domestic debt.
Our updated Giovannini and de Melo measure of external repression revenues is available for 15
countries.7 We find that in contrast to the 1980's, when many EMEs were found to be earning
significant revenues from external repression, EMEs in the most recent decade earned negative
(and statically insignificant) revenues from external repression on average. The negative
revenues mean that EME governments faced lower borrowing costs in foreign markets (even
after accounting for costs imposed by exchange rate fluctuations) than in the domestic market.
The decline in external repression revenues has occurred despite the fact that emerging

transactions.

economies continue to maintain significant restrictions on capital outflows (notwithstanding the
liberalizations over time).
There are several interpretations of the negative external repression revenues found in our study.
An EME government with positive revenues from repression may be reluctant to liberalize
outflows to manage the concerns posed by surging NKI for fear of losing these revenues, but
may find it easier to liberalize when there are no revenues to be lost. In fact, EMEs did liberalize
outflow policy substantially in the 2000's. Most of the outflow liberalizations took place in the
years of surging NKI (putting downward pressure on domestic interest rates) and rapid economic
growth (leading to increasing fiscal revenues from other sources), which suggests that fiscal
concerns did not pose a binding constraint for EMEs in this period. Another interpretation of the
negative external repression revenues is that, while many of these EMEs could have borrowed
even more in markets abroad in the last decade, they refrained from doing so. That they chose
not to borrow more abroad even at favorable interest rates may reflect concerns about greater
balance sheet exposure (as most can borrow only in hard currencies) and the fear of a sudden
stop. Finally, emerging markets may be willing to temporarily accept negative repression
revenues to preserve the future repression tax base.
The result that concerns related to net capital inflows took predominance over fiscal concerns in
the decision to liberalize capital outflow controls in the 2000’s finds further support in our
empirical exercise. EMEs liberalized outflow controls less when facing greater NKI volatility
and higher short term balance sheet exposure, while they eased more when NKI, real exchange
rate appreciation pressures, reserves accumulation were high – all pointing to concerns about
foreign exchange valuation and domestic overheating concerns. Unlike the 1980’s, we find very
limited importance of fiscal variables in explaining liberalization of capital outflow controls only in the samples of relatively closed and non-inflation targeting countries, do we see a
negative association of greater external repression revenues with easing of outflows. This lack of
association is consistent with the decline in repression revenues for EMEs in the 2000’s. This
decade saw the growth accelerations of emerging markets, which led to a decline in their risk
premia. The 2000’s were also a decade of few adverse external shocks, real exchange rate
appreciation pressures in EMEs and overall improved stances of their fiscal policies. 8 Revenues
from repression therefore became less important in the decision to liberalize outflows.
The paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we elaborate on the potential motivations
for imposing capital outflow controls. Section III describes the construction of and trends in one
of the main data series compiled in the paper – the changes in capital outflow controls. We
devote section IV to describing the measures used to capture fiscal concerns, including the
second main data series compiled in the paper - revenues from external repression. Section V

Among the intriguing developments has been the relative decline in the role of ‘easy taxes to collect’ (like tariff
and inflation taxes), and the rise of the role of Value Added Taxes (Aizenman and Jinjarak, 2009 and Bird and

II.

Potential motivations for capital outflow controls

Many motivations have been advanced in the literature for imposing or liberalizing controls on
outflows.9 Capital outflow controls have often been imposed, at least temporarily, in response to
a run on the currency or inflation, sovereign debt and financial crises. However, outside of crisis
periods, one of the principal motivations for sustaining capital outflow controls is that these
controls allow governments to lower the domestic cost of borrowing for themselves and for their
preferred sectors by keeping domestic savings at home. Further, controls on outflows facilitate
the use of other measures constituting financial repression such as interest rate ceilings, high
reserves requirements etc., by preventing capital flight in response to these restrictions. This
allows governments to further depress their borrowing costs. Giovannini and de Melo (1993)
showed that when countries faced constraints on their ability to raise revenue through taxes,
financial repression could be the optimal choice. They also showed that for some 24 emerging
and developing economies over the period 1972-87, revenues from external repression averaged
about 9 percent of total government revenue from taxes. The large magnitude of the revenues
earned from maintaining outflow controls posed potentially a major constraint towards
liberalizations of the capital account. Outflow controls can also help governments maximize the
inflation tax by limiting the ability of residents to shift to foreign assets.10 Aizenman and
Guidotti (1994) also argued that capital controls may be desirable in developing countries when
collection costs associated with taxes (other than the inflation tax) are high.
Empirical work in the 1990’s underscored the importance of fiscal policy as a motivation for
imposing capital controls. Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti (1995) found that capital controls were
associated with a higher ratio of government consumption to GDP, higher government revenues
from seigniorage and lower real interest rates. Alesina et. al. (1994) found that maintaining
capital controls led to lower stock of government debt (presumably through lower debt service
costs) and that countries with weaker central banks (and therefore lower resistance to use of
inflation tax) were more likely to be using capital controls. Recent work by Reinhart et. al (2011)
also suggests that financial repression played an important role in the rapid reduction of public
debts in advanced economies in the Bretton Woods era.
For countries that have legacy capital outflow controls (as was true for many emerging
economies entering into the new millennium), the decision on whether and when to liberalize
9

Capital controls include both controls on inflows by non-residents and controls on outflows by residents. Unless
otherwise specified, we focus the discussion in the paper on controls on outflows by residents, briefly called outflow
controls.
10
See Dooley (1996) and Eichengreen (2001) for excellent surveys of the literature on these motivations.

4

these controls can be constrained by fiscal reasons discussed above or by exogenous political
factors, but can also be motivated by economic pressures. In particular, liberalization of capital
controls can be motivated by their use as tools for managing macroeconomic and financial
pressures arising from the size and volatility of net capital inflows. In periods of surges in net
capital inflows, policymakers may choose to either tighten controls on inflows or to liberalize
controls on outflows in order to reduce the size and volatility of net capital inflows. The various
concerns arising from rapid increases in NKI can be grouped into 4 main categories:
1.
Concerns about overheating: Net capital inflows to emerging markets are often
procyclical, increasing when the economies are booming and retreating when the economies are
slowing (Kaminsky et. al., 2005). Surging capital inflows in periods of high economic growth
can therefore lead to overheating concerns by further boosting growth, domestic credit
expansion, and inflationary pressures.
2.
Concerns about foreign exchange valuation: Net capital inflow surges can lead to
overvaluation of the exchange rate, thus hurting export competitiveness.
3.
Concerns about financial stability: NKI surges can exacerbate asset price booms in
real estate or financial markets and aggregate balance sheet exposures, thus giving rise to
financial stability concerns.
4.
Concerns about macroeconomic volatility: The booms and busts in non-resident’s
inflows can be an independent source of macroeconomic volatility and can exacerbate existing
cycles.
Liberalizing capital outflow controls can address these concerns by opening up a window for
greater outflows, thus reducing the net capital inflows during boom times. Analogously,
tightening of capital outflow controls can prevent capital flights in poor times. In addition,
having resident investments abroad that can be liquidated and brought home at times of slowing
economic growth can counter stops in inflows by non-residents, thus reducing overall volatility
of net capital inflows. This channel has been shown to be historically important in mitigating the
volatility of net capital inflows in high income economies in recent studies of gross capital flows
(Broner et. al. 2011; IMF 2011b).
In this paper, we test the relative importance of the concerns described above, for 18 large
emerging economies, over the period 2001-2010. The testable hypotheses associated with each
are described in section V. The next section describes the evolution of capital controls in the last
decade in these emerging markets.

III.

Evolution of capital controls policy in 2000’s

In order to analyze the motivation for liberalizing capital outflows, we use a unique dataset that
contains changes in capital account regulation for 22 major EMEs between 2001 and 2010. This
5

dataset is an expanded version of the data used in Pasricha (2012).The main source of data is
IMF Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). The
AREAER provides information on member countries’ exchange arrangements, exchange and
trade restrictions and capital transactions. We focus on the capital transactions section which
includes relevant regulations applicable to the financial sector. AREAER information is
supplemented with information on similar measures from central banks’ and other country
regulators’ websites, news sources, as well as other research papers.11
The dataset provides information on the changes in capital controls, by date of effectiveness. We
classify each change as representing an inflow or outflow control, an easing or a tightening of
policy and then count the number of inflow easings, inflow tightenings, outflow easings and
outflow tightenings per quarter.
Our strategy of counting the number of measures is in line with the existing de-jure measures of
capital controls which measure tightness of capital controls by summing (or using the principal
components of) dummies that indicate the existence of regulations under broad categories of
transactions (Edwards, 2007; Chinn-Ito, 2008; Schindler, 2009). However, it goes further and
adds information in one or more dimensions to what is available in the existing indices: (i) the
changes taking place within the broad categories considered by the indices12 and (ii) the changes
in capital controls applicable to inflows or outflows. The existing indices miss one or both
dimensions. For example, of all the indices for which data is available for at least part of the
2000’s, Schindler (2009), Chinn-Ito (2008) do not take into account changes in restrictiveness of
controls. Further, the Chinn-Ito (2008) and Edwards (2007) indices do not distinguish between
restrictions on inflows and outflows.13 The dataset used in this paper provides information both
on the changes in controls under each category of transactions as well as on whether the
restrictions relate to inflows (by non-residents) or outflows (by residents).14
The main demerit of this method of analysis is that the number of measures per se does not allow
us to judge the impact of the measures (eg: in terms of volume of transactions it influences) or to
differentiate the changes by their magnitude, which varies between countries. However, most
measures in the database are of relatively homogeneous magnitude, and therefore we think our
11

Further information on the dataset is provided in Appendix A.
The dataset categorizes changes as belonging to restrictions under 8 the subcategories of capital transactions (for
example, controls on capital and money market instruments, controls on direct investment, etc.), as described in the
Appendix. If a major policy announcement includes several changes, each regarding a different category of
transaction, each of these changes is counted individually. For example, on 14 March 2005, Brazil introduced three
different changes - an elimination of the limit on investment in shares of the main company by employees of firms
belonging to foreign groups; an elimination of the limit on remittances for outward FDI by non-financial private
enterprises; and a removal of the authorization requirement for guarantees by non-financial judicial persons in credit
operations for their foreign subsidiaries. Each of these changes is counted individually in our database.
13
Schindler (2009) index provides information on controls under different subcategories of transactions, for inflows
and outflows separately, but the dataset only covers the period 1995-2005.
14
However, our dataset does not allow a cross-country comparison of the existing level of de-jure controls, unlike
the other indices.
12

6

approach does provide useful information about the overall direction of policy, and about the
attempts to liberalize or to close the capital account. 15
The countries in the database include the 21 emerging markets that are in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index and Argentina. However, for the purpose of this paper, we drop the 3 eastern
European countries, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, as their capital account liberalizations
were determined by their EU accessions (rather than by any economic pressures). We also drop
changes in Argentina before 2003, in order to include in the sample only relatively homogeneous
or marginal changes in policy. We also drop Turkey before 202Q2, to exclude its currency and
inflation crisis period.
The emerging markets in the sample changed their capital controls 664 times between 2001 and
2010. Capital outflows controls saw 302 changes and of these the majority, or 274 changes were
easing of restrictions on outflows. There were 362 changes in inflow controls, out of which a
minority (135) were tightening of inflows. Outflow liberalizations were far more common than
inflow tightenings in the sample.
Since countries could be easing and tightening restrictions on outflows (inflows) in the same
quarter, to gauge the overall direction of policy, we computed the following measures:
1. Net Easings of Outflows: This measure is the difference between the number of outflows
easing measures and the number of outflows tightening measures in each quarter. We use
this as our main dependent variable in this paper.
2. Net Tightening of Inflows: This measure is the difference between the number of inflow
tightening measures and the number of inflow easing measures in each quarter.
Further, since both outflows easings as well as inflows tightenings would tend to reduce the
pressure of net capital inflows, we group the measures into whether the measures would
encourage or discourage NKI, i.e. the difference between inflows and outflows, as in Pasricha
(2012). This gives us the following additional categories:
3. NKI Reducing Measures: These are measures that represent tightening of inflows or
easing of outflows.
4. NKI Increasing Measures: These are measures that represent easing of inflows or
tightening of outflows.
5. Net NKI Restricting Measures = NKI Reducing Measures - NKI Increasing Measures
= Net Easing of Outflows + Net Tightening of Inflows
Figure 1 shows that net NKI restricting measures peaked in 2007 and again in 2010, both peak
years for net capital inflows pressures to EMEs. It also shows that in 2007, EMEs as a whole
were liberalizing, rather than tightening controls on inflows, and that outflow liberalizations were
15

Appendix Table A.2 in Pasricha (2012) provides a list of measures taken by EMEs in 2010, which attests to their
small magnitude.

restricting measures are the sum of net outflows easings and net inflows tightenings.

There were important differences between countries in terms of the degree of activism on the
capital account (Figure 2). India and Thailand were the most active, introducing more than 50
NKI reducing measures over the sample period, whereas Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco the least
active in changing capital account policy. There were also differences between countries in terms
of the extent to which they relied on tightening of inflow controls or easing of outflow controls
as NKI reducing measures. Malaysia, Morocco and Chile relied exclusively on easing of
outflows, whereas Indonesia, Peru, Brazil and Colombia used largely inflow tightening
measures.
The propensity to change capital outflow controls could be associated with the monetary policy
framework and by flexibility of the exchange rate regime of countries (Table 1). EMEs with
inflation targeting (IT) monetary policy and freely floating exchange rates on the whole took
fewer measures and changed policy less frequently. The last two columns of Table 1 show that a
regime with freely floating exchange rates introduced an average of 0.51 measures per quarter,
16

The figure sums net inflow tightening measures over all EMEs so that net inflow tightening in one country could
be cancelled by net inflow easings in another. However, the conclusion that EMEs were liberalizing outflows more
than they were tightening inflows remains even if one looks only at NKI reducing measures, i.e. inflow tightenings
in all countries and outflows easings in all countries only. As noted above, there were far more outflow easings than
inflow tightenings in the sample period.

exchange rate regimes, a member of which on average introduced 1.16 measures per quarter, out
of which 0.68 measures were NKI reducing measures. The statistics for non-freely floating
regimes are very similar to those for non-inflation targeting monetary policy regimes. An IT
monetary policy regime introduced an average of 0.72 measures per quarter, out of which 0.53
measures were NKI reducing measures. For all country groups, outflow easings were the
majority of NKI reducing measures. However, in contrast to freely floating exchange rate
regimes, IT regimes relied relatively less on outflow easing measures and more on inflow
tightening measures: 38% of NKI reducing measures introduced by IT regimes were inflow
tightenings, compared to 16% of NKI reducing measures introduced by freely floating exchange
rate regimes.

Note: NKI reducing measures are the sum of outflows easings and inflows tightenings. The number of measures is the total over
the period 2001-2010 (except Argentina and Turkey, as noted in text).

In the subsequent sections, we ask whether the frequency and timing of the net liberalizations of
outflows was contingent on fiscal, macroeconomic and financial pressures in the economy in
question, focussing in particular on the fiscal revenues that the governments were obtaining from
external financial repression.

IV.

Measures of Fiscal Concerns

In order to capture the extent to which lost fiscal revenues would constrain the removal of capital
outflow controls, we deploy several measures of fiscal concerns. The first and the most direct
measure of contribution of outflow controls to fiscal revenues is the revenue from external
repression, which we describe in the next sub-section. The other measures of fiscal concerns,
9

described in sub-section IV.B below seek to capture the fiscal space of the government as well as
the revenue from the use of internal repression that capital outflow controls facilitate.

A.

External Repression Revenues in EMEs

The main purpose of capital outflow controls is to keep the domestic cost of borrowing for the
government below the rate that would prevail in a fully integrated economy. Therefore, external
repression revenue can be defined as the additional cost the government would have to bear to
service its domestic debt in the absence of outflow controls. Thus defined, external repression
revenue can be measured as the difference between the effective interest rate on the
government’s foreign borrowing less effective interest rate paid by the government on domestic
borrowing, times the repression tax base which is the government’s domestic debt (Giovannini
and de Melo, 1993).
The domestic interest rate is computed as:
/2
where interest payments and debt outstanding are measured in local currency units (LCU).17
The effective external interest rate on government debt has two components: the nominal (US)
dollar interest rate on foreign debt and the foreign exchange component (i.e. the increase in
dollar interest payments due to depreciation of the domestic currency against the dollar). These
components are defined as follows:
Nominal dollar interest rate on external debt
This is computed as the nominal dollar interest payments, including increases in interest arrears,
divided by the average outstanding external debt measured in USD.
∗

/2

The nominal dollar interest rate is computed on non-concessional public and publically
guaranteed (PPG) external debt from private creditors.18

17

The formulas provided in the text are for annual data. For quarterly data, the interest rate is annualized by
multiplying the RHS of the above formula by 4. All interest rates are expressed as percent per annum. Full details on
the data and construction of external repression revenues are in Appendix B.
18
However, interest arrears were available only for total debt from private creditors (including non-PPG debt) and
on total PPG debt (including bilateral and multilateral concessional debt). In all cases, the arrears on total PPG debt
were higher than arrears on total debt from private creditors. Therefore, as an approximation, we used the arrears
from total debt from private creditors. Arrears refer to interest accrued (and due) but not paid.

10

Foreign Exchange (FX) component
The foreign exchange component is computed as the percentage depreciation of average annual
exchange rate times the nominal dollar interest rate on external debt and captures the increase in
interest payments in dollars due to depreciation of the domestic currency against the USD.
∗

.

/

The effective external interest rate is computed as the sum of the above two components.
In principle, there is a third component of effective interest rate on external debt, the “debt
revaluation cost”. This cost consists of two elements: (a) the change in local currency value of
the stock of external dollar denominated debt due to change in the value of local currency against
the dollar, and (b) the USD revaluation cost, defined as the increase in dollar value of debt
outstanding (repayable) due to appreciation of the dollar against the currencies of denomination
of external debt. Debt revaluation cost represents accrued costs and is amortized over the
duration of the loan, rather than over the course of a single year. In this paper, our base measure
of repression revenues includes only the nominal dollar interest rate and the FX component.
While we also compute the debt revaluation cost (and provide summary statistics on the
repression revenues including it), we do not include it in our base measure of external repression
revenues. The reason is that without knowing the maturity of the debt and the repayment
schedule, we would add a very large and volatile component to the repression revenues by
including debt revaluation cost.19
Another key area in which our measure differs from Giovannini and de Melo is that they use
only central government external and domestic interest commitments. Due to data constraints,
we use public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt for external interest rate, and the broadest
level of government for which data is available for domestic interest rate. Since central
government debt usually carries the lowest risk premium, the use of interest on PPG debt would
tend to inflate our estimates of repression revenues. However, as we will see below, even at these
inflated levels, for most EMEs in our sample period, the repression revenues were in fact
negative, in contrast to Giovannini and de Melo.
Trends in external repression revenues
The median external repression revenues in the 2000’s for 8 of the 15 countries for which we had
data, were negative (Figure 3). For another 3 countries, the median revenue as a percentage of
GDP was less than 0.5% of GDP. The mean repression revenues for all countries during the

When Giovannini and de Melo (1993) computed repression revenues, the USD revaluation component was very
small, as most external debt of emerging markets was denominated in USD. In our sample, the USD revaluation
component turns out to be large and volatile. This may be due to changes in currency composition of external debt
of EMEs but also due to greater flexibility of their exchange rates.

when Giovannini and de Melo estimated the average revenue to be about 1.4% of GDP.20

Note that the average revenues of 1.4% of GDP mentioned in the introduction are for all the EMEs in Giovannini
and de Melo’s sample. Figure 4 averages over the part of their sample that overlaps with ours. Repression revenues
including debt revaluation costs include the effect of exchange rate changes on the value of principal in the effective
external interest rate. Repression revenues excluding debt revaluation costs only incorporate the impact of exchange
rate changes on interest payable in computing the effective external interest rate. For more information, see our
working paper.

Why have external repression revenues declined?
Most of the difference between external effective and domestic interest rate in 2000’s is due to
the difference between the dollar external interest rate and the domestic interest rate (Figures 5
and 6). In contrast to the 1980’s, the FX component is a small part of effective interest rate
differentials for most EMEs. The decline in the external repression revenues therefore reflects
both the decline in the external dollar interest rate and the decline in the FX component.

Notes: The plotted values are the means of the variables for the 2000’s for each country. Interest Rate differential refers to the
percentage difference in external dollar and domestic interest rates. FX component is the percentage exchange rate depreciation
against US dollar times the external dollar interest rate. All variables are expressed as percent per annum.

Several factors can explain the decline in the two components of external repression revenues,
many of them related to the growth accelerations of EMEs in 2000’s (in comparison to 19701980s). The relatively strong growth performance of EMEs vis-à-vis the rest of the world in that
period in combination with the easing of monetary policy in the advanced economies led to an
overall decline in their external risk premia. Strong domestic demand growth and a shortage of
capital in EMEs drove up domestic interest rates and this effect could not fully be counteracted
by net capital inflows (given remaining restrictions on these inflows). It also led to a real
exchange rate appreciation trend, which contributed to the decline in FX component.

Interest Diffl.

Repression Tax Rate

Note: Interest Diffl. refers to the percentage difference in external dollar and domestic interest rates. FX component is the
percentage exchange rate depreciation against US dollar times the external dollar interest rate. All variables are expressed as
percent per annum.

There are two other possible reasons for the low estimates of external repression revenues. First,
it is possible that in a period of strong EME growth, the external risk premia may have declined
too much. History suggests that just as the European periphery debt was overvalued in the years
after the launch of the Euro, it may be the case that EME external debt may seem overvalued in
the 2000’s in posterity. Second, our measure assumes that the external interest rate represents the
"market interest rate" for government debt that would prevail in absence of outflow controls.
This assumption ignores the fact that several EME governments, particularly India and China,
raise a very small share of their total debt (if any) in markets abroad. As a result of the pervasive
14

internal financial repression measures, they are able to finance their borrowing needs largely
domestically, without pushing up interest rates on their debt and their debt burdens. Therefore,
the market interest rate they would face in the absence of external repression could be
substantially underestimated by the prevailing external interest rate as the governments' fiscal
positions would look less sustainable and risk premium on government debt would be higher in
the absence of these restrictions (the demand curves the governments face would be steeper).
Interpretation of negative repression revenues
There are several interpretations of the negative external repression revenues found in our study.
Liberalization of outflows by EMEs with negative external repression revenues (other things
being equal) could in theory lead to a further increase in their domestic interest rate over the
external rate. An EME government concerned about cost of servicing the domestic debt would
either not liberalize outflows or do so in tandem with liberalizing inflows or borrow more in
markets abroad (liberalizing inflows only for itself). In practice, the fiscal concerns did not
prevent outflow liberalizations - EMEs did liberalize outflow policy substantially in the
2000's. However, this was made possible by surging inflows, as most of the liberalizations took
place in the years of high NKI (putting downward pressure on domestic interest rates) and rapid
economic growth (leading to increasing fiscal revenues from other sources). This suggests fiscal
concerns did not pose a binding constraint to outflow liberalization in the 2000’s.
A possible interpretation of the negative external repression revenues is that, while many of
these EMEs could have borrowed even more in markets abroad in the last decade, they refrained
from doing so. That they chose not to borrow more abroad even at favorable interest rates may
reflect concerns about greater balance sheet exposure (as most can borrow only in hard
currencies) and the fear of a sudden stop. In the event of a sudden stop and the associated sharp
exchange rate depreciation, EMEs with larger external debt denominated in foreign currencies
would experience a sharper increase in the cost of servicing the debt and more limited external
debt refinancing opportunities. The challenges faced by South Korea and Mexico during the
2008-9 crisis would reinforce the concerns about the risks of sudden stops in bad times even in
relatively developed EMEs. 21 Finally, emerging markets may be reluctant to open more widely
the door to capital outflows to preserve the future repression tax base.

B.

Other measures of fiscal concerns in EMEs

Being a measure of external repression, our measure of financial repression does not take into
account the revenues that internal financial repression measures (interest rate controls, directed
21

These considerations also suggests that a drawback of the Giovannini and de Melo (1993) financial repression
measure is focusing on the first moment (expected interest rate cum exchange rate depreciation), overlooking the
second moment (exposure to future volatility associated with costly external debt refinancing at times of crisis).

15

credit, high reserve requirements, etc. that would be ineffective without capital controls) generate
for the government. That is to say, our measure of repression does not measure the extent to
which the domestic interest rate is below the domestic rate that would prevail in absence of
internal repression (and in presence of capital controls). In addition, it does not take into account
the seignorage tax revenue, the savings to the government from sterilization and the costs
imposed on households that accrue to corporations or banks, rather than to the governments.
Recent literature suggests that the size of implicit taxes generated via the banking sector in
EMEs can be substantial. According to Lardy (2008),
"The People's Bank of China controls interest rates in a way that has led to significant financial
repression-low and now negative real return on deposits-as inflation has risen in recent years.
This distorted interest rate structure is a significant obstacle to further reform of the financial
system and to sustaining China's rapid economic growth. Financial repression costs Chinese
households about 255 billion renminbi (US$36 billion), 4.1 percent of China's GDP, and a fifth
of it goes to corporations, one-quarter to banks, and the government assumes the rest."
To capture some of the contribution to fiscal policy of internal repression revenues, we use
several measures of fiscal space and of internal repression. These include:
1. Measures of fiscal space:
a. Fiscal balance as a share of government tax revenues
b. Gross government debt as a share of government tax revenues
2. Measures of fiscal internal repression revenues:
a. Liquidation tax (negative of the real interest rate on domestic government debt)
b. Real deposit interest rate on domestic government debt
c. Banking sector net lending to government as a share of banking sector
assets*Inflation. This measure captures the extent to which the government is able
to allocate banking savings to itself and tax it through inflation.
Consistent with the decline in external repression revenues, measures of fiscal space and of
internal repression revenues in EMEs have also improved over time. Government debt has
declined as a percentage of tax revenues and the fiscal balance has improved substantially,
potentially allowing the governments room to liberalize outflow controls (Figure 7). The
inflation tax the governments obtained from captive lending to it by the banking sectors has also
declined substantially between the 1990’s and 2000’s (Figure 8). The real deposit interest rate on
banking sector deposits has been positive on average during both 1990’s and 2000’s and
governments have been paying positive real interest rates on its domestic debt (implying
negative liquidation taxes.

16

The fact that EME growth was stronger and less volatile in 2000’s may have also led to a lesser
need for repression revenues. Indeed, the average tax-GDP ratios for EMEs increased by 2
percentage points to 15.2% of GDP in 2000’s from the 1990’s (Figure 9).22

Among the intriguing developments has been the relative decline in the role of ‘easy taxes to collect’ [like tariff

Methodology and Data

In this section, we describe the methodology used to assess the relative importance of NKI
versus fiscal concerns in determining the capital outflows policy. The main hypotheses is that the
larger the fiscal reliance on revenues from repression, the fewer the easings of outflows, and the
larger the overheating or exchange rate valuation pressures, the greater the incentive to liberalize.
The response to macroeconomic volatility or financial stability concerns arising from NKI could
be ambiguous – countries may want to liberalize outflows to build a buffer of foreign
investments or to close capital account to insulate them from external shocks. The dependent
variable is number of net easings of outflows in a quarter by each country. The main regression
equation is:

where
are the set of control variables, are the country fixed effects, are the time fixed
are the errors. All equations were estimated using OLS, with robust standard
effects and
errors reported.23 We tested a number of indicators for each of the hypotheses identified in
section II above, i.e. the fiscal, overheating concerns, concerns about macroeconomic stability,

Since the number of net easings can be both positive and negative, models like tobit and probit are not appropriate
for use with our data.

foreign exchange valuation concerns and financial stability concerns. These variables and the
expected signs of their coefficients are listed below24:
Fiscal Concerns: The main hypothesis is that the greater the fiscal concerns or revenues from
repression, the lower the incentive to liberalize outflows.
1. Measures of fiscal space: More fiscal space allows greater liberalization
(i) Fiscal balance/tax revenues (+)
(ii) Government debt/tax revenues (-)
2. Revenue from external repression (-)
3. Liquidation tax (-): This variable is the negative of the real interest rate on domestic
government debt. Expected sign is negative as higher tax means more potential revenue
that could be lost by liberalization and therefore lower incentive to liberalize
4. Real deposit rate on bank deposits (+): Expected sign is positive as lower rate suggests
greater internal repression and therefore lower incentive to liberalize
5. Banking sector net lending to government (as a share of total bank assets)*inflation (-):
Expected sign is negative as higher values of this variable imply greater revenues from
internal repression
NKI Concerns: The variables measuring NKI concerns are grouped by hypotheses:
I. Concerns about "overheating": Greater overheating pressures would create incentive to
liberalize, in order to reduce the size of NKI
1. We use two variables that capture the size of the NKI:
(i) NKI/GDP (+)
(ii) NKI surge dummy (+)
2. Credit growth (+)
3. Credit gap (+): This variable is the ratio of domestic credit/GDP to its 3-year trend
3. Inflation rate (+)
4. GDP growth (+)
II. Concerns about FX valuation:
1. REER appreciation over the past year (+)
2. Change in FX reserves/GDP (+)
3. FX regime (-): This is a dummy variable which takes the value 1 for freely floating
exchange rate regimes, and 0 otherwise
4. IT monetary policy dummy (-)
5. Exchange market pressure (EMP) (-): This variable is defined as the sum of exchange
rate depreciation and reserve outflows (scaled by reserve money). Higher values of this
24

The data appendix Table A.3 lists the data sources and granularity of each variable and Table A.4 provides their
summary statistics.

19

variable indicate greater depreciation pressure, which would create incentive to tighten
outflow controls.
6. Undervaluation (PPP-based) (-)
III. Concerns about Macro-stability: These variables are defined as 3-year rolling standard
deviations of the underlying variables.
1. NKI volatility (+/-)
2. GDP growth volatility (+/-)
3. FX volatility (+/-): The underlying variable is monthly REER change
4. Equity return volatility (+/-): the underlying variable is monthly equity market return
IV. Concerns about Financial Stability:
1. Balance sheet exposure (-): This variable is defined as (External Debt – Reserves)/GDP.
The expected sign is negative as countries with higher balance sheet exposure may want to
limit current and future outflows (in the event of a crisis).
2. Short term balance sheet exposure (-): (Short Term External Debt – Reserves)/GDP
3. Surge (in gross inflows) (+)
4. Sudden stop (in gross inflows) (+)
5. Flight (surge in gross outflows) (-)
6. Increase in stock price index over past year (+)
7. Inflation crisis (-)
8. Banking crisis (-)
Other controls:
1. Trade/GDP (+): Expected sign is positive as effectiveness of existing controls would
decrease with greater trade openness.
2. Chinn-Ito index of capital account openness (-): Expected sign is negative as more open
countries are expected to have liberalized less as they had fewer controls left to remove.
3. Quinn index of capital account openness (-)
4. Net tightening of inflows (+/-): Both easing of outflows and tightening of inflows are net
capital inflows reducing measures, and therefore may be substitutes. However, countries
facing a large NKI surge may be tempted to try both.

All explanatory variables except the dummy variables are normalized by subtracting the intercountry mean and dividing by the standard deviation, so that the regression coefficients can be
interpreted as the impact on net easings of a one standard deviation change in the explanatory
variables. To control for potential endogeneity, all the explanatory variables are lagged one
quarter. We also drop outliers, which are defined as observations that lie more than 5 standard
deviations from the mean of each variable for all explanatory variables. In addition, extreme
values of net easings of outflows and number of net tightening of inflows are also considered
20

outliers (outside the range [-8,9] for net easing of outflows and [-8,8] for net tightening of
inflows) and excluded from the reported regression results.
Since each of the concerns has several available proxies, we ran the regressions sequentially. In
the first set of regressions, each variable for each hypothesis was first tested individually in
bivariate regressions and then all variables for the given hypothesis are added as a group in
multivariate regression for each hypothesis. From these regressions, all variables that were
significant at 20% level of significance or less in any of these regressions were used in the joint
test of the hypothesis. In the paper, we only report the results of the first stage for the fiscal
concerns and the multivariate regressions. The number of zeros in the left hand side variable is
large, as the dataset is quarterly and outflows policy does not change every quarter for most
countries. Using OLS on the dataset would tend to produce estimates of coefficients that are
biased towards zero and have inflated standard errors. As a robustness check, we also performed
the second stage regression after dropping all the zeros – results are consistent with those
described in the paper, and are available on request.

VI.

Results

The first stage results for the fiscal variables are in Table 2 below. In the full sample of countries
none of the fiscal variables are significant at conventional levels of significance suggesting that
(in contrast to the 1980’s) these variables were not important in the decision to change capital
outflow policy. In order to compare the fiscal and the NKI motivations, we report the second
stage regressions with both sets of indicators in Table 3. Due to concerns about correlation
between the explanatory variables, particularly those related through the dimensions of the
impossible trinity or the trilemma (size of net capital inflows, capital account openness,
exchange rate stability and reserves accumulation), we add each of these variables individually
first in columns (1)-(7) and then jointly in columns (8)-(11).
We find that among the two hypotheses, most of the significant variables are associated with
concerns related to NKI, confirming the use of outflows controls in NKI management policy
(Table 3). Countries liberalized more in response to overheating and appreciation pressures (as
evidenced by the sign and significance of variables stock price inflation and exchange market
pressure and REER volatility). They liberalized outflows less in the face of financial stability
concerns or macroeconomic volatility. The coefficients of short term balance sheet exposure and
NKI volatility are negative and significant. In fact, these two variables had the largest
coefficients suggesting that they posed an important constraint to the decision to be more open to
capital flows. Further, more open EMEs liberalized less frequently than less open EMEs.

21

Although fiscal balance variable has a positive sign and is significant in some regressions,
suggesting that countries with better fiscal positions liberalized more, the measures of internal or
external repression revenues are not significant.25
The results in Table 3 suggest not only that fiscal concerns did not post a binding constraint on
the liberalization of outflows, but also that any constraints on this liberalization came from the
perceived impact of greater openness on macroeconomic volatility and financial stability.
To test the robustness of our results, we divided the countries into groups according to their
degree of capital outflow openness at the beginning of sample period, their exchange rate regime
and whether or not they had a monetary policy with an explicit inflation target. Countries with
tighter capital outflows controls at the beginning of the sample period would have greater leeway
to use outflows policy changes to manage NKI pressures, but may also be more constrained by
fiscal concerns if their reliance on repression revenues is greater. In the closed economy subsample, we therefore expect to see fiscal variable play a larger role than in the full sample.
Further, as Table 1 showed, non-flexible exchange rate regimes non-IT countries used net
outflows easings more frequently than others. Table 4 shows that these countries were also less
open on the capital account, had worse fiscal balances and higher repression revenues on average
than their counterparts. Therefore, we would expect to see fiscal policy constraints to be
stronger in the sub-samples of non-flexible exchange rate and non-IT monetary policy regimes.
We use Schindler’s index of outflow restrictions in the year 2000 to group countries into those
that had higher than median restrictions to begin with (more closed economies) and those with
lower than median restrictions (more open economies). We used IMF AREAER classification to
group countries as having freely floating and non-freely floating exchange rates and into
countries that had an explicit inflation targeting (IT) monetary policy, and those that did not.
The results for subgroups of countries that were less open, that had a non-flexible exchange rate
regime and for countries that had IT and non-IT monetary policy regimes are in Tables 5-8
respectively.26 The results of the sub-groups are very similar to those for the full sample. The
concerns about size and volatility of net capital inflows and the resulting overheating, balance
sheet exposures and appreciation pressures are still the most important explanatory variables.
Our expectation of a higher importance of fiscal variables in the decision to liberalize outflow
controls is confirmed only in the sample of closed economies, and to some extent for non-IT
countries. Closed economies were less likely to ease when external repression revenues and
inflation tax on bank lending to government were higher. The latter variable is also significant in
the sample of non-IT countries. Both IT and non-IT regimes were more likely to ease when fiscal
25

The R-squares in the regressions are not very high and we do not explain more than 17% of the variation in the
full sample. Several factors could account for this, the foremost among them being the high frequency of 0’s in the
sample. There are 121 non-zero net easings of outflows in our sample of 456 observations used in the second to
fourth columns of Table 3.
26
The number of non-zero observations of the dependent variable for country groups open economies, flexible
exchange rate regimes was very low – we therefore do not report these results.

22

balances are higher. The anomaly is the sign of the liquidation tax variable which suggests that in
the samples of closed economies and non-IT regimes, countries with higher liquidation tax
liberalized more. However, this may simply reflect the fact that liquidation tax was negative for
most countries in our sample. In the non-flexible exchange rate regimes sample, variable related
to NKI concerns were the only ones that showed strong associations with liberalizations.

VII. Conclusions and interpretations
This paper documents a steep decline in revenues from external repression in EMEs during
the 2000’s compared to the earlier decades. Further, our results indicate that most of the
significant associations of outflows liberalizations in the 2000’s were with concerns related to
net capital inflows. Emerging market economies (EMEs) facing high volatility in net capital
inflows and higher balance sheet exposures liberalized less. Countries eased more in response
to higher net capital inflows, and when these inflows translated into higher appreciation
pressure in the exchange market, higher real exchange rate volatility, and greater
accumulation of reserves. Unlike the 1980’s, we find very limited importance of fiscal
variables in explaining liberalization of capital outflow controls - only in the sample of
relatively closed and non-inflation targeting countries, do we see a negative association of
greater repression revenues with easing of outflows.
The remarkable decline in the fiscal reliance on external repression is good news given that it
was accompanied by the deeper tax collection from broader base. However, it begs the
question of the future of financial repression. History suggests that one should be cautious in
extrapolating from recent trends. The growth acceleration of China and India, and the illusive
great moderation prior to the global crisis of 2008-2009 probably contributed to the declining
reliance on repression revenues. Yet, a reversal of favorable trends frequently changes
attitudes towards financial repression (Reinhart, Kirkegaard and Sbrancia, 2011). History also
suggests that EMEs may rely on financial repression as a contingent tax in the wake of
realized bad tail events (as evidenced by the experience of Argentina in the early 2000s).

Measures on the capital account and their classification

The database on capital controls measures is an extended version of the data collected in Pasricha
(2012).It includes information on the “capital transactions” category of the IMF AREAER,
supplemented by information on similar measures from central banks’ and other country regulators’
websites, news sources and other research papers. The IMF AREAER breaks down the broad
category, capital transactions, as follows:
1. Controls on capital and money market instruments:
a. Controls on capital market securities: further classified into “controls on shares or other
securities of a participating nature and “banks or other debt securities”
b. Controls on money market instruments
c. Controls on collective investment schemes
2. Controls on derivatives and other instruments
3. Controls on Credit Operations:
a. Commercial Credits
b. Financial Credits
c. Guarantees, sureties and financial backup facilities
4. Controls on direct investment
5. Controls on liquidation of direct investment
6. Controls on real estate transactions
7. Controls on personal capital transactions
8. Provisions specific to the financial sector:
a. Provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions, which includes open
foreign exchange position limits and other provisions
b. Provisions specific to institutional investors
A change is counted as a change in policy affecting one of the above 8 categories. If a major policy
announcement takes place and includes measures related to several categories above, each measure is
classified in each category in which it belongs and is counted separately.
We classify the measures into the following categories:
1. Whether the measure (or change) impacts capital inflows (I) or outflows (O) or cannot be
clearly identified as affecting only one of these categories (other). 27,28 For the purpose of this
paper, the ‘other’ measures are classified as both outflows and inflow controls.

27

In this paper, capital inflow controls refer to controls on inflows by non-residents (including controls on
repatriation of non-residents’ inward investments) and controls on outflows refers to controls on outflows by
residents, including on repatriation of outward investments. An alternative way to define capital outflows controls
would group controls on outflows by residents and repatriation of non-residents’ investment together. In general,
tightening of repatriation restrictions for non-residents’ investments already brought in (retroactive restrictions) is
rare in non-crisis periods. Therefore, this distinction would be meaningful in our sample only for Argentina’s post2001 controls. For this reason, we dropped Argentina’s pre-2003 data in the analysis.
28
Examples of the other measures that could not be classified as inflow or outflow measures include limits on net
open foreign exchange positions of financial institutions, ban on use of foreign currency in special economic zones,

34

2. Whether the change represents an easing (E) or tightening (T) of policy or a neutral/
institutional change.

Total interest on
external public and
publicly guaranteed
(PPG) debt from
private creditors

Interest payments on external PPG debt from private
creditors + change in interest arrears to private creditors, in
USD amounts. Several adjustments are made, in addition:
1. WDI debt statistics on interest arrears are available only
for total interest arrears on PPG debt (i.e. not interest
arrears on PPG debt from private creditors) and total interest
arrears from official creditors. Under the assumption that all
official creditor arrears are on PPG debt, we first compute
interest arrears on PPG debt from private creditors as the
difference between total interest arrears on PPG debt and
interest arrears on debt from official creditors.
2. The change in arrears are then adjusted for interest
forgiveness as part of sovereign commercial restructurings.
Now, again, interest rescheduled and forgiven is avaiable
only for all external debt (not just PPG debt). Therefore, we
took the dates of sovereign commercial restructurings from
Das et. al. (2012) and added back to the change in interesst
arrears, the interest rescheduled or forgiven only for years in
which there was a sovereign restructuring with private
creditors.
3. For India, the external interest payments in 2003 and
2005 jumped as they included the interest accrued over 5
years but paid at maturity, for Resurgent India Bonds and
Millenium India Deposits. The interest payments for RIB
amounted to USD 1 billion in 2003 and for MID to USD 1.6
billion in 2005 (Source: RBI report on India's external debt,
various issues). These amounts were deleted from 2003 and
2005 interest payments and re-allocated proportionately
over the 5-year term of each of these borrowings. Source:

Variables, except interest rates, are in local currency units (LCU) unless otherwise specified.
For quarterly data, the domestic interest is annualized by multiplying the above by 4.
In some cases, where the data starts in 2001 or later, the first observation uses gross domestic debt
outstanding at t, instead of the average of t and t-1, to avoid losing the observation.
For Argentina, Peru and Turkey, quarterly, non-seasonally adjusted data on interest payments was available,
and displayed seasonality. The interest rate computed was smoothed by taking the 4-quarter moving average
of it (including time t).
