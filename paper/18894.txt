ABSTRACT
This paper seeks to understand the impact of the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex)
Program on hospital choice and consumer welfare for rural residents. The Flex Program created a
new class of hospital, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH), which receives more generous
Medicare reimbursements in return for limits on capacity and length of stay. We find that
conversion to CAH status resulted in a 4.7 percent drop in inpatient admissions to participating
hospitals, almost all of which was driven by factors other than capacity constraints. The Flex
Program increased consumer welfare if it prevented the exit of at least 6.5 percent of randomly
selected converting hospitals.

Introduction

Embedded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was a provision creating the Medicare Rural
Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Program. The Flex Program established a new class of hospitals
under Medicare, Critical Access Hospitals (CAH), to which hospitals could convert. In order
to obtain CAH status, hospitals are required to comply with a number of restrictions including limits on their capacity (25 beds or less) and on their patients’ average length of stay
(LOS).1 In return for accepting these constraints, CAHs receive cost-based reimbursements
from Medicare that are typically more generous than those under the standard prospective
payment system (PPS). The overarching purpose of the Flex Program is to improve and sustain access to quality healthcare services for rural residents. One important avenue through
which the program sought to achieve this goal was through increasing the financial stability
of rural hospitals which, in turn, was intended to spur improvements in the quality of patient
care and reduce the likelihood of closure.
In the years since its implementation, the Flex Program has left a large imprint on the
structure of rural hospital markets and costs of rural healthcare. Currently, over 1,330 rural
hospitals—comprising 25 percent of all U.S. hospitals, 4 percent of all beds, and over half of
rural hospitals—have CAH status.2 The Flex Program caused hospitals to shed significant
amounts of capacity so that they could qualify for conversion. In 1996, 14 percent of rural
hospitals had 25 beds or less, while that figure rose to 50 percent by 2005. Of the hospitals
that had converted to CAH status by 2006, 98 percent had more than 25 beds in 1996. The
mean capacity of eventual converters decreased from 42 beds in 1996 to 22 beds in 2005.3
The program has also been costly: it is estimated that Medicare’s payments to hospitals
with CAH status have increased by 35 percent (MedPAC, 2005). Yet it has enjoyed wide
1

The initial legislation also required CAHs to be distant from other hospitals but this requirement could
be waived if the state in which the hospital was located deemed the hospital a necessary provider.

and bipartisan support, with multiple proposals for expansion.4
The scale of the Flex Program, its costliness, and its impact on the size distribution of
rural hospitals all suggest that a policy evaluation of the consequences of the Flex Program
is an important exercise to undertake. Moreover, the program embeds an interesting tension: participation provided benefits to firms but also imposed limitations on their actions.
Specifically, in order to convert to CAH status, hospitals generally reduced their capacity
and altered their service offerings. The lower capacity and its associated impact on other
hospital characteristics as well as the constraints on LOS may make CAHs a less attractive
option to patients and the physicians who refer them. However, to the extent that the Flex
Program forestalled some exit, it increased (or at least prevented a larger decrease in) access
to hospital services for rural residents. This dimension of the Flex Program likely increased
consumer surplus. Thus, given the possible effects of the Flex Program, its net impact on
rural residents is ambiguous. This tension is also found in other, large scale federal programs.5
In this paper, we focus on a single but important dimension of the welfare impact of the
Flex Program: consumer surplus. Using detailed patient discharge data, we first examine the
impact of CAH conversion on converting hospitals’ inpatient populations. Specifically, we
assess the impact of conversion on average patient severity, the number of inpatient services,
and the distributions of diagnoses and insurance arrangements. This analysis provides us with
a broad understanding of the impact of the program. We then estimate the patient/physician
utility function from hospital choice using multinomial logit (MNL) specifications and use
the estimates to calculate the impact of conversion on patient demand for and utility from
the hospital. We estimate separate MNL models for different patient groups in order to be
able to drill down and understand the disparate impacts of conversion across different health
4

For instance, the proposed Critical Access Hospital Flexibility Act of 2009 (H.R. 668) based capacity
calculations on occupied beds, thereby effectively raising the bed capacity threshold, while H.R. 487, also
introduced in 2009, would again let states waive the 35-mile requirement for CAH designation. Both enjoyed
bipartisan support.

times (Roberts and Schlenker, 2013).

insurance arrangements and diagnoses. Our data span the pre- and post CAH conversion eras
which allows us to use a difference-in-difference identification strategy.6 Finally, we use the
parameter estimates from the demand model to quantify the likely consumer welfare impact
of the Flex Program by calculating the reduction in hospital exit that would be necessary to
offset the consumer welfare impact of conversion.
We construct our analysis data from several different sources. Our principal dataset
is inpatient discharge records for the states of Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon,
Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin over the years 1998-2005. Each of these states
has both large rural populations and many CAH conversions. The discharge data contain
the identity of the hospital from which the patient was discharged as well as patient ZIP
code, demographics, diagnoses, and the source of health insurance. We link these data to
a variety of hospital characteristics, including the date of conversion to CAH status, if any.
Our analysis data contain over 7 million patient observations.
We find that hospitals that ultimately converted to CAH status were different in observable ways from non-converting hospitals, even prior to conversion. The converting hospitals
treated fewer patients and offered fewer services. Their patients were, on average, less severely
ill, more likely to be Medicare enrollees, and traveled shorter distances. Moreover, upon conversion, CAHs saw a modest drop in the average number of diagnoses treated, and shifts in
the distribution of the diagnoses treated. In contrast, mean patient age and severity of illness
for converting hospitals did not substantially change following conversion.
Turning to our MNL demand and utility estimates, we find that CAH conversion would
reduce patient utility, leading to a decline in inpatient volume. Overall, the drops in volume
occurred fairly systematically across payor and diagnosis. For instance, conversion to CAH
status led to a roughly 5 percent average decline in both Medicare and privately insured
6

Our data begin in 1998, which is just after the Flex Program was passed, and before the vast majority
of conversions occurred.

admissions.7
For the diagnoses that we investigated, conversion to CAH status resulted in a patient
volume drop of between 2 and 12 percent. Some outliers include a relatively large decline of
8 percent for acute myocardial infarction patients and a relatively small decline of 2 percent
for pneumonia patients.8
In our model, CAH conversion can affect utility through two different pathways. First, a
bed size reduction can and does directly affect utility, perhaps because it proxies for the loss
of a range of inpatient and outpatient services. Second, independent of bed size reductions,
the CAH designation may impact the attractiveness of the hospital. For example, CAHs
also receive cost-based reimbursements for outpatient services and CAHs may emphasize
those services. In addition, restrictions on LOS may cause the hospital to drop services.
We find that virtually all of the decline in demand from conversion is driven by factors that
are unrelated to bed size reductions. This is true across the entire patient population and
generally holds for patients with different insurance arrangements and different conditions.
Finally, we use our estimates from the hospital choice model to explore the policy tension
in the Flex Program noted above. Even though the multinomial logit (MNL) parameters
imply that CAH conversion reduces patient utility, if the Flex Program averted a sufficient
number of hospital closures, this effect could overcome the reduction in consumer surplus
associated with conversion. Specifically, we calculate the reduction in exit necessary for the
Flex Program to increase consumer surplus, assuming that the exiting hospitals are randomly
drawn from the set of eventual CAH converters. We find that the Flex Program increases
average consumer surplus if it forestalled the exit of a random subset of 6.5 percent or more
of converting hospitals. As a point of comparison, over the period 1999-2005, a total of 2.4

These figures are the percentage drops in 2005 volume from all 2005 CAH hospitals having their 1998
bed size and not having CAH status to them all having CAH status and their 2005 bed size. They are from
our specifications that include bed size and interactions as regressors.

Consistent with this, Lutfiyya et al. (2007) found that quality of pneumonia for CAHs is higher than
urban hospitals but for all other measures of quality of care, CAHs performed more poorly.

The paper proceeds as follows. Immediately below we discuss the related literature.
Section 2 describes the institutional features of the Flex Program. Section 3 describes our
data and provides summary statistics. Section 4 presents our empirical model. Section 5
presents the estimates of the impact of the Flex Program on hospital demand and performs
the welfare analysis. Section 6 concludes.
Related literature
Despite the importance of the Flex Program, there have been few national level evaluations of the program and even fewer papers that employ credible identification to assess the
program’s impact. In a preliminary analysis using ZIP code level data from Medicare’s Health
Services Area File (HSAF), Gowrisankaran et al. (2011) found that conversion to CAH status
led to a precipitous decline in inpatient demand. However, further analysis revealed that the
data likely contain non-random measurement error which probably explains the magnitudes
of the estimated decline. This paper builds on our previous work by using higher quality,
more accurate discharge data which allows for a richer demand system specification and the
ability to examine the impact of conversion along patient demographic, insurance status, and
disease dimensions.
Joynt et al. (2011) document that CAHs are less likely to have intensive care units, cardiac
catheterization labs, and electronic medical records than other U.S. hospitals. More recent
work documents that 46 percent of CAH have less than basic health information technology
systems (Adler-Milstein et al., 2014). Furthermore, Joynt et al. find that patient outcomes
are worse at CAHs relative to all other hospitals. Finally, Joynt et al. (p. 51) also refer to a
number of recent studies that find negative to mixed impacts of CAH conversion on quality
of care. Lutfiyya et al. (2007) find that rural CAHs perform significantly worse than urban
hospitals on 7 out of 12 hospital quality indicators. Using data from Iowa, Li et al. (2007)

find that CAH conversion had a mixed impact on patient safety outcomes. The above papers
identify the impact of conversion using cross-sectional information. As we show below, CAHs
are meaningfully different from non-CAHs prior to their conversion. Thus, cross sectional
analyses may be prone to biased inferences regarding the causal relationship between CAH
status and hospital performance. We complement this body of research by using panel data
with a difference-in-difference design and by modeling only rural hospitals.
Another literature analyzes financial aspects of the Flex Program. Stensland et al. (2003)
and Stensland et al. (2004) study the financial effects of CAH conversion and find that
conversion led to an increase in Medicare revenue and profit margins. Casey and Moscovice
(2004) study the quality improvement initiatives of two CAHs after conversion, and conclude
that the cost-based payments help the hospitals to fund activities that would improve quality
of care such as additional staff, staff training, and new medical equipment.
Our work also relates to research that estimates the impact of hospital closures on welfare.
Capps et al. (2010) note that while hospital closures reduce consumer surplus, they also
reduce costs, thereby lowering required public subsidies. Using a framework similar to the
one we employ here, they study five closures and find that cost reductions outweigh the
gain in consumer surplus from keeping the hospital open. McNamara (1999) studies the
pre-Flex Program impact of rural hospitals closures on consumer surplus and finds that the
average compensating variation for the closure of the nearest rural hospital is about $19,500
(1988 dollars) per sample hospitalization. Finally, Joynt et al. (2015) examines the impact
of hospital closures on patient outcomes and finds little impact of hospital exit on mortality
rates for Medicare beneficiaries.

The Flex Program

The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program was authorized by Section 4201 of the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA).10 Under the Flex Program, hospitals could apply to
state and federal agencies to convert to Critical Access Hospital status. To obtain approval
from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), hospitals needed to meet a
number of requirements, most importantly limitations on bed size, LOS, and distance to
other hospitals (which we detail below). Although the legislation did not specify the intent
of these limitations, the likely purpose was to limit the financial exposure of the government
and to limit CAHs to treat low acuity conditions for quality of care reasons.
In addition, CAHs were required to provide inpatient, laboratory, emergency care, and
radiology services, consistent with the program goals of maintaining access to emergency and
other care for rural residents. CAHs also needed to develop agreements with acute care hospitals regarding patient referral, communication, and emergency and non-emergency patient
transportation. Each CAH also needed an agreement with its referral hospital for quality
improvement or could choose to have that agreement with another organization. The BBA
provided resources for hospitals to hire consultants to project revenues and costs and help
determine whether a conversion strategy would be optimal for the hospital given its objectives. Upon conversion, CAHs receive cost-based Medicare reimbursements for inpatient,
outpatient post-acute (swing bed), and laboratory services. Currently these payments are
set to 101 percent of average accounting costs.
We now detail the bed size, LOS, and distance requirements for CAHs. The initial 1997
BBA legislation specified that CAHs could have a maximum of 15 acute inpatient beds and
25 total beds, including swing beds.11 LOS was limited to a maximum of 96 hours (4 days).
Converting hospitals were required to be in rural areas and be at least 35 miles by primary

road and 15 miles by secondary road from the nearest other hospital. However, hospitals
could (and often did) have the distance restriction waived by having their state declare
themselves a “necessary provider.” Currently, most CAHs are within 25 miles of another
hospital.

Source: MedPAC (2005)

The program’s rules have been modified several times since its inception. Table 1 summarizes the main legislative changes to the program over time. The most important of these
changes are: starting in 1999, states were allowed to designate hospitals in Metropolitan
Statistical Areas “rural” for CAH classification; starting in 2000, cost-based reimbursements
were extended to patients in swing beds; starting in 2003, the acute inpatient limit was raised
8

from 15 to 25 and reimbursements were increased from 100 to 101 percent of costs; and starting in 2006, states could no longer waive the distance requirements for new applications.
Allowing the treatment of post-acute care patients to be reimbursed on a cost basis dramatically increased the profitability of caring for those patients. According to MedPAC
(2005), “[t]he shift from receiving SNF rates for post-acute patients to receiving estimated
costs (which assume post-acute routine costs equal acute routine costs) resulted in a dramatic
increase in post-acute care payments from $259 per day before conversion to $1,016 per day
after conversion” (p. 163). These changes to the Flex Program provide variation in the benefits to CAH conversion within the study period which will change the profitability thresholds
for conversion over time. Our difference-in-difference analysis identifies the consumer welfare
effects of CAH conversion by exploiting this variation.
Since the intent of the Flex Program was to maintain access to hospital care for rural residents, it is useful to examine the changes in rural hospital structure since the implementation
of the policy. Out of the 4,779 hospitals in the U.S. in 1994, 49.3 percent (or 2,355 total) were
rural.12 Figure 1 shows the annual number of CAH conversions and the fraction of CAHs
among rural, general acute care hospitals in the U.S. before and during our sample period.13
Starting in 2000 and through 2004, roughly 150 hospitals per year converted to CAH status.
We believe that the delay between the enactment of BBA in 1997 and the timing of conversion is due to the complexity and uncertainty in the application process, which requires large
amounts of paperwork, inspection visits, and CMS approval.14 By 2005, over 40 percent of
rural hospitals and 25 percent of all U.S. hospitals had adopted CAH status. Conversion
rates declined after 2005, when the minimum distance requirements became mandatory.

in the bed size of rural hospitals. In 1996, the median bed size was 54. By 2005, the median
bed size had dropped to 36 while the mean bed size went from 72 to 56. Even more striking
is that many hospitals dropped in bed size to exactly 25—the upper-limit of the level allowed
by the Flex Program. By 2005, 21 percent of rural hospitals had exactly 25 beds.

Data

To construct our analysis dataset, we link together information from several sources. Our
primary data source is state inpatient discharge datasets. These data, which were acquired
through the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research’s Health Care Utilization Project,
provide discharge level information for virtually the universe of patients admitted to a hospital
in that state. Each observation contains information on the discharging hospital, patient’s
home ZIP code, age, gender, primary payor, dates of admission and discharge, Diagnostic

The sample for our main analysis extends from 1999 to 2005 due to availability of discharge data, but
we have hospital characteristic data going back to 1996.

Related Group (DRG), and principal diagnosis and procedure codes. DRGs are clusters of
related diagnoses or procedures that use similar resources. Medicare uses DRGs to determine
prospective payments for admissions to non-CAHs. Roughly, the hospital is paid the base
rate times the DRG weight plus some adjustments. We merge in DRG weight information
from CMS.
We use discharge data from seven states: Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. We selected these states due to data availability and
because they each have sizable rural populations and a large number of CAH conversions.
Within these states, we extract the sample of patients residing in rural areas. We focus on
rural residents since the goal of the Flex Program is to improve healthcare access to those
residents. The Colorado, Iowa, Washington State, and Wisconsin data span 1998 to 2005;
the North Carolina and Oregon data are available from 2000 to 2005; and the West Virginia
data begin in 2001 and end in 2005.16
Within these states, our analysis sample consists of patients residing in rural ZIP codes.
16

To be included in the sample, a hospital must have at least 100 discharges over the 1998 to 2008 time
frame.

11

We define rurality using Rural-Urban Commuting Areas (RUCA) version 2.0.17 These measures of rurality are based on the size of cities and towns and their functional relationships,
as identified by work commuting flows. RUCAs have been used by CMS to target CAHs and
other rural policies, such as the ambulance payments. CMS considers all ZIP codes that have
RUCA greater or equal to four to be rural and we adopt the same criterion in this paper.
We merge in data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Healthcare Cost
Report Information System (HCRIS), the Census Bureau, and the Flex Monitoring Team.
We pull in information on the hospital’s latitude and longitude from the AHA. We link in
hospital staffed bed size information from HCRIS.18 We use ZIP code centroid latitude and
longitude data from the Census Bureau. Our data on the timing of CAH conversion come
from the Flex Monitoring Team.19 In addition, the Flex Monitoring Team data contain
accurate information on the number of staffed beds for the hospitals that converted.
CAH conversion may affect the range of services offered by the hospital as well as altering
the types of providers working in the hospital. Thus, CAH conversion may differentially affect
patient choice based on diagnosis. The detail in the patient discharge data allows us to analyze
the impact of CAH conversion by specific diagnoses, Major Diagnosis Category (MDC), and
type of insurance (Medicare and Privately Insured).20 MDCs are formed by combining the
principal diagnosis codes into one of the 25 mutually exclusive categories corresponding to
single organ system or etiology and, in general, are associated with a particular medical
specialty.
Our dataset contains over 7 million patient discharges. Because of the size of the dataset,
17

These measures are developed collaboratively by the Health Resources and Services Administration, the
Office of Rural Health Policy, the Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, and the WWAMI
Rural Health Research Center. WWAMI is a cooperative program with the University of Washington School
of Medicine and the States of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho.
18
The AHA also has information on bed size but the HCRIS data appears to be more accurate.
19
The Flex Monitoring Team is a collaborative effort of the Rural Health Centers at the Universities of
Minnesota, North Carolina and Southern Maine, under contract with the Office of Rural Health Policy. The
Flex Monitoring Team monitors the performance of the Flex Program, with one of its objectives being the
improvement of the financial performance of CAH.

it is impractical to estimate the parameters for some of our demand models. Therefore, in
order to generate parameter estimates in a reasonable amount of time and maintain precision, we randomly sample patients so that the sample used to estimate the parameters has
approximately 10 million hospital/patient observations.21
Table 2 presents summary statistics for our analysis data for the first and last years of
our sample, 1998 and 2005 respectively. The first two columns present statistics from 1998
and hence include data from the four states which were in our sample in 1998—Colorado,
Iowa, Washington, and Wisconsin—while the last two columns present statistics from 2005
and hence include data from all seven states in our sample.
The first panel of Table 2 presents statistics at the hospital level for the entire sample.
There were almost no CAHs in our sample in 1998 while 42 percent of the rural hospitals in
our sample were CAHs by 2005. The number of beds at rural hospitals was similar for our
analysis sample in 1998 and 2005, though these represent hospitals in different sets of states.
The second panel of Table 2 presents a more apples-to-apples comparison of the difference
between 1998 and 2005 market structure by displaying the same set of statistics but restricting
the sample to hospitals in the four states which were in our sample for the entire time period.
The 1998 statistics are the same as in the first panel, by construction. Comparing the 2005
statistics to the 1998 ones, we find that the number of hospitals in our sample in these four
states dropped from 420 to 396 while mean hospital size dropped from 107.0 beds to 95.66
beds over our sample period. Mean admissions per hospital increased about 17 percent, likely
because of the fewer options available.
The third panel of Table 2 presents statistics at the patient level. The percentage of
patients admitted to a CAH increased from essentially zero to 16 percent by 2005. Approximately half of the patients were admitted to the hospital closest to their home. Patients
traveled an average of 33.7 km (20.9 miles) to the hospital in 1998 and the average distance
21

We selected 10 percent of the entire sample, 25 percent of the Medicare population and privately insured
population, 50 percent of obstetrics and circulatory MDCs, and 25 percent of other MDCs.

Empirical Model

We model the discrete hospital choice decision of the patient conditional on deciding to receive
inpatient treatment. Each period t, there is a set of patients It = {1, . . . , It }, each of whom
lives in a rural area. Individual patients, denoted by i ∈ It , seek inpatient treatment for their
illnesses. Patients differ by their diagnoses, demographics, insurance status, and location.
Each patient (potentially in consultation with her physician) observes the characteristics of
the available hospitals and makes a discrete choice among all available hospitals in order to
maximize her utility. Let Jt denote the set of hospitals active in period t. A patient i’s choice
set is all hospitals within 85 km (52.8 miles) of her location—which we denote Jti ⊆ Jt —and
the outside option. The inside option choice set includes both rural and non-rural hospitals
within the this radius. The outside option corresponds to choosing a hospital outside of this
radius.
We now detail the patient utility function.22 Denote the patient’s diagnosis d(i, t). Patient
i’s utility from an inpatient admission to hospital j ∈ Jti is given by

uijt = ξjd(i,t) + wijt β + εijt ,

(1)

where ξjd is the hospital time-invariant fixed effect for diagnosis d, wijt is a vector of characteristics specific to the hospital and patient. The unobservable, εijt , follows an i.i.d. Type
I extreme value distribution and is observable to the patient but not the econometrician.
22

In practice, the patient’s choice of hospital is also influenced by the patient’s physician preferences over
hospitals. Under the assumption that the physician acts as an agent of the patient, the parameter estimates
reflect patient preferences.

15

Patients select the hospital in their choice set that generates the highest utility. The utility
of the outside option (admission to a hospital greater than 85 km away) is normalized to
ui0t = εi0t . We include a parsimonious set of variables in wijt in order to capture the potential impact of conversion on patient preferences. Table 3 lists the variables included in
wijt .

Year Indicators

Note: “Ever CAH” is an indicator for whether the hospital ever converted to CAH status.

CAH conversion has two sets of impacts on the characteristics of the hospitals. First,
conversion changes the reimbursement structure of the hospital which can affect the hospital’s
staffing, wages, material inputs, capital investments, and services for long LOS patients.
Second, conversion affects the hospital bed size which directly affects capacity and scale. In
principle, we could directly model the role of capacity constraints in the demand equation
(Conlon and Mortimer, 2013), but most hospitals are not capacity constrained.23 However,
hospital bed size likely captures many dimensions of the hospital beyond simply the number
of patients it can house at a given time. Reducing capacity, even if the hospital is not capacity
constrained, may impact the attractiveness of the hospital to patients and their admitting
physicians. For example, the indirect impact of a reduction in hospital scale may make the
hospital less attractive to physicians in their admission decisions and shift the emphasis on
the types of care provided and patients targeted.
23

From both our conversations with policy experts and our analysis of the data, we believe that the vast
majority of converting hospitals were not capacity constrained either pre- or post-conversion. For instance,
using staffed beds as the denominator and the product of discharges and LOS as the numerator, we calculated
that converting hospitals had an average capacity usage of 28 percent in 1998.

16

For this reason, we flexibly model the impact of CAH conversion on patient utility through
CAH indicators and their interactions as well as through bed size and its interactions. While
we believe that including beds in the choice specification is useful, an argument can be
made that beds should not be included in the demand specification. Thus, we also estimate
demand specifications that do not include the bed size variables. We include interactions of
distance and an indicator for whether the hospital ever converts, and an indicator of whether
the hospital was the closest to the patient in order to control for pre-conversion differences
between CAH and non-CAHs.24
Let δijt = ξjd(i,t) + wijt β denote the “mean utility” from being admitted to hospital j,
for j ∈ Jti . Given the distributional assumption on the errors, we can write the choice
probabilities for patients as:

P rijt =

exp(δijt )
P
.
1 + k∈Jti exp(δikt )

(2)

Price does not enter the patient’s utility. There are two reasons for this. First, hospital
prices for our broad set of hospitals are not available. Second, a majority of rural patients are
covered by Medicare and do not face any price variation. While privately insured patients
may face some cost sharing arrangements, the net amount of cost sharing is very low.
Given the distributional assumption on εijt , it is straightforward to estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood. The patient utility parameters will be identified from the
geographic variation in patient and hospital locations and the extent to which consumers
choose hospitals based on characteristics such as distance, CAH status, and hospital size.
Because we allow for hospital fixed effects, the effects of CAH status and bed size changes
will be identified from the difference-in-difference. In contrast, if CAH conversion is correlated with unobservable hospital characteristics—which is likely given the high correlation
24
We explored whether to include higher-order time trends interacted with an indicator for whether the
hospital ever converted and found that the coefficients on the high-order terms were very small and not
statistically significant.

17

with observable characteristics—failure to include hospital fixed effects would bias the parameter estimates. Even with hospital fixed effects, it is possible that our coefficient estimates
reflect time-varying changes in hospital attributes that correlate with conversion to CAH status. However, we seek to rule out this explanation by including a falsification test of patient
utility on future CAH status.
We are also interested in evaluating the heterogeneity across patients in the impact of
treatment at CAHs. Conversion implies that hospitals must abide by limitations on the
number of available beds and the average LOS. Reducing capacity may diminish the scope
economies of hospitals, which, as a consequence, may focus on more common, lower acuity
conditions. If this were the case, then patients with more complex illnesses would be made
relatively worse off by CAH conversion as hospitals shed high acuity and low prevalence
services. In contrast, patients requiring urgent care may be less sensitive to the level of
service provision and more sensitive to distance, and hence be less affected by conversion
to CAH status (and therefore benefit from the program if it prevents exit). Because some
conditions such as acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) both require urgent care but also
often necessitate complex medical treatments, the impact of the Flex Program for patients
with these illnesses is even more ambiguous. In addition, the impact of conversion may
differ by the type of health insurance as CAH conversion changes the reimbursements for
Medicare patients but does not directly affect payments for the privately insured population.
To account for heterogeneous impacts of conversion across patients, we estimate separate
specifications for different populations defined by insurance status, specific diagnoses, and
MDC.
We focus on five specific diagnoses: AMI, heart failure, hip fracture, pneumonia, and
stroke. We chose these diagnoses because they all have high in-hospital mortality rates and
thus are important conditions to monitor and, with the exception of hip fracture, they are

18

relatively common afflictions. The conditions are defined using the principal ICD-9CM25
diagnosis field listed in the discharge data. We also analyze the seven most common MDCs:
circulatory system, digestive system, injuries, mental diseases, musculoskeletal system, obstetrics/newborns, and respiratory system. We group the remaining MDCs into the “other”
category.

4.1

The Impact of Conversion on Patient Volume

We calculate the impact of CAH conversion on the volume of discharges using the parameter
estimates from the MNL model. To perform this calculation, we compare the change in
expected volume of the eventual CAH hospital from conversion.26 That is, we calculate the
average treatment effect on those hospitals that select into treatment (conversion). We now
detail this calculation.
Given the parameter estimates, the expected volume of patients as a function of CAH
status and bed size is given by:

EV oljt (CAHjt , Bedsjt ) =

It
X

P rijt .

(3)

i=1

We calculate the mean impact of hospital j’s CAH conversion (for the converters) as:
= EV oljt (CAHjt = 1, Bedsjt ) − EV oljt (CAHjt = 0, Bedsjpre−CAH )
∆CAH
jt

(4)

where we set t = 2005 and where Bedsjpre−CAH is the 1998 bed size of the hospital (prior
to conversion). Since patients choose among hospitals, the effect also depends on whether
characteristics of other hospitals change. We primarily calculate and report the impact of
CAH conversion assuming the simultaneous conversion of all hospitals but also investigate

We allow beds to adjust to the new level at the same time as conversion to CAH status. We found that
beds played a very minor role in these results.

4.2

Consumer Welfare Analysis

A focus of this paper is on quantifying the consumer welfare impact of the Flex Program.
This program imposes an implicit policy trade-off. Hospitals receive more generous payments
but must agree to substantial reductions in their capacity and average LOS. Statically, these
constraints almost surely weakly reduce consumer welfare. However, a principal policy goal
of the program is reduce the number of rural hospital exits by providing financial stability,
which likely increases consumer surplus. Thus, the net impact of the program on consumers
depends on whether the gain from forestalled hospital exit outweighed the consumer welfare
loss from CAH conversion. In order to get a sense of this trade-off, we evaluate how much the
Flex Program would have affected consumer welfare given a range of different assumptions
on the level of hospital exit averted by the program.
We proceed as follows. First, note that consumer surplus can be expressed as:

CSt (Jt ) =

It
X

ln(1 +

i=1

X

exp(δijt )),

(5)

j∈Jti

following Small and Rosen (1981)’s derivation.27 Using (5), we evaluate the difference in
consumer surplus between the current environment and an environment where hospitals did
not have CAH status but where some hospitals might have exited, as:

∆CSt (Jt ) = CSt (Jt ) − E[CSt,N oCAH (Jt,N oCAH )],

(6)

where Jt,N oCAH is a random counterfactual industry structure where some converters exited
27

It is well-known that random utility models can overstate the value of product variety (Ackerberg and
Rysman, 2005). The logit model is particular susceptible to this criticism as it is a thick tailed distribution.
However, we estimate the utility model using individual data where the model well characterizes actual
choices and thus mitigates the role of the error term in these welfare calculations.

20

and CSt,N oCAH is consumer surplus with CAH indicators equal to 0 and bed sizes equal to
pre-conversion levels (for converting hospitals that did not exit).
Each of our counterfactuals assumes that eventual CAH converters have equal probabilities of exit in the absence of the Flex Program. We simulate a number of different
counterfactual exit probabilities, ranging from 0 to 15 percent. For each counterfactual exit
probability, we calculate the change in expected consumer surplus using equation (6). We
also report statistics on the mean distance to chosen and closest hospitals.

Summary Evidence of the Impact of CAH Conversion

Table 4 presents summary evidence in 1998 and 2005 for the rural hospitals in our sample
broken down by those institutions that eventually converted during our sample time frame
and those hospitals that did not.28 There are two important themes that emerge from these
statistics. First, converting hospitals are very different than non-converting hospitals along
several dimensions prior to their conversion. Second, conversion reduces the relative number
of patients.
Converting hospitals were significantly smaller (measured by admissions and bed size)
prior to their conversion than non-converting hospitals. These hospitals had, on a patientweighted basis, 69 percent fewer beds (46 v. 150) than hospitals that did not convert. Future
CAHs also treated approximately 63 percent fewer patients than non-converting hospitals
prior to their conversion. Converting hospitals offered fewer services as measured by the
number of unique DRGs treated. On average, future CAHs’ patients were diagnosed with
60.1 unique DRGs while non-converters’ patients spanned 107.6 unique DRGs.29
28

Here we limit the analysis to patients admitted to hospitals that are continuously in our sample from
1998 to 2005.
29
The fewer unique DRGs could also be a consequence of the size of the patient population. However,

21

In addition to the differences in size and span of services in 1998 between converters and
non-converters, the characteristics of the patient populations meaningfully differed between
these two hospital classes. Patients admitted to eventual converters had a 25 percent shorter
mean LOS and and a 29 percent lower average DRG weight. Future CAHs treated relatively
more Medicare and less privately insured patients. The more generous payments that come
with CAH conversion only apply to Medicare patients and thus it is not surprising that
converting hospitals admitted more Medicare patients prior to conversion. Patients admitted
to non-converting hospitals, on average, traveled much further (42 v. 17 km) (26.1 v 10.6
miles) and were much more likely to bypass a closer hospital on their path to the admitting
hospital. For eventual converters, 75 percent of their patients were admitted to the closest
hospital, while for the non-converters, only 36 percent of their patients were admitted to the
closest hospital.
Not only are converting hospitals meaningfully different than non-converting hospitals
prior to their conversion, the summary statistics also suggest that conversion affected the size
of the hospital and the distribution of the patient population (along a few dimensions) relative
to non-converting hospitals. Not surprisingly, the mean bed size of the converting hospital
dropped by approximately 50 percent. Non-converters saw a large increase in their volumes
over our sample period. Somewhat surprisingly, however, patient volume for converters
was virtually unchanged after CAH conversion. Converting hospitals experienced a modest
decline in the number of services provided while non-converting hospitals showed a large
increase in the number of unique DRGs over this period.30
In Table 5 we present the distribution of diagnoses and MDCs for converting and nonconverting hospitals for the first and last year of our sample. Prior to conversion, CAHs had a
higher percentage of their patient load with pneumonia and heart failure than hospitals that
controlling for the number of patients, future converters’ patients spanned significantly fewer DRGs.
30
Again, it is possible that the relative decline in the number of unique DRGs is driven by the decline in
volume. We have estimated the impact of CAH status on the mean number of diagnoses in a fixed effects
framework controlling for the volume of patents and this finding is robust.

Future CAHs also had a greater 1998 percentage of their load in the Digestive Track and
Respiratory MDCs and a smaller 1998 percentage in the Mental Health and Musculoskeletal
MDCs than the never-converters. Interestingly, after conversion, CAHs experience a large and
statistically significant decline in the percentage of their patient load from AMI patients (45
percent)—which has a high acuity—and a modest (though still significant) rise in the percent
from pneumonia patients. Correspondingly, there is a notable decline in the Circulatory
System MDC for CAHs upon conversion. We also observe a statistically significant decline
in the percent of discharges for Mental Diseases and a statistically significant increase in the
percent of discharges for Musculoskeletal and Respiratory Diseases.

In sum, CAHs were different from non-CAHs prior to their conversion. Conversion led
to a large decline in mean bed size, a decline in their relative volume, a relative reduction in
the number of services offered, and a reduction in the number of patients with high severity
illnesses, despite the emergency room requirement.

5.2

MNL Demand Estimates

The summary statistics presented above suggest that conversion reduced hospital demand. Of
course, these reduced form estimates are not robust to shifts in population or changes in the
characteristics of other hospitals which could plausibly be correlated with CAH conversion.
In this section we estimate parameters of the utility function for inpatient hospital choice for
rural residents from the MNL model specified in Section 4. This allows us to quantify the
impact of CAH conversion and capacity changes, as well as to perform welfare analyses on
the impact of the Flex Program.
Our specifications include hospital fixed effects, an indicator for CAH status, measures
of capacity, and interactions of CAH status with measures of distance. Because Table 4
shows that CAHs draw from a more local pool than other hospitals prior to conversion,
we include interactions between hospitals that convert at some point in our sample and
measures of distance. We call hospitals that convert at some point “Ever CAH.” We include
Ever CAH and an interaction of Ever CAH and a time trend to allow for the possibility that
these hospitals had a declining utility over time. Thus, our results should be interpreted
as pertaining to the impact of CAH treatment on hospitals that ultimately converted. Any
inference to hospitals that did not convert should be made with caution.

Table 6 presents the parameter estimates for six specifications, one per column. The
first two columns are for the sample of all patients, the next two columns are for Medicare
patients, and the final two columns are for private patients. In columns 1, 3, and 5 we include
the number of staffed beds and its interaction with distance and DRG weight, an indicator
for CAH conversion and interactions with distance, and an indicator of whether the hospital
is the closest. Because there is some ambiguity as to whether it is appropriate to include
beds, columns 2, 4, and 6 report coefficient estimates without staffed beds and interactions.
In these three specifications, we also add an interaction of CAH status with the DRG weight.
Tables 9 and 10 in the Appendix provide MNL parameter estimates for specific conditions
and MDCs for the specifications with beds.31
The coefficient estimates in Table 6 closely align with expectations and the results from
the hospital choice literature. Increasing distance to the hospital reduces utility but the
impact is concave. Patients also have a strong preference for the hospital that is closest to
them and the more severely ill the patient is (as measured by the DRG weight) the greater is
the utility from larger hospitals and the less is the utility from CAHs. For both the sample as
a whole and private pay patients, patient utility for hospitals that eventually converted was
declining prior to conversion: the coefficient on Ever CAH×Trend is negative and significant.
However, for Medicare enrollees, this parameter is not significantly different from zero.
We may be concerned that our coefficients on CAH status reflect contemporaneous trends
relating to those hospitals other than CAH status. In order to investigate this assumption,
we estimated specifications with an indicator for conversion to CAH status in two years. In
all cases, the inclusion of lead CAH indicators did not dramatically change the coefficients
on the existing variables on CAH status. In some cases, some lead CAH indicators were
marginally significant, and in other cases, not significant.32 We take from this exercise
that these hospitals and markets may have had other time-varying factors, but that CAH

conversion likely did have a causal impact.

5.3

Effects of CAH Conversion on Patient Volume

Because our MNL results in Table 6 include many interactions of CAH status and bed size it is
difficult to determine magnitudes directly from the coefficient estimates. For this reason, we
use the MNL parameter estimates to calculate the mean impact of conversion on the number
of admissions. Table 7 presents this information for each specification by insurance type and
specific disease, and Table 8 presents the same information by MDC. Here we calculate the
percentage change in 2005 volume for CAHs that is attributable to their conversion, based
on the MNL coefficient estimates. We calculate the percentage change in volume assuming
that all CAHs converted simultaneously using equation (4).33 For the specifications with
beds, our simulations all set post-conversion bed size to their actual level. That being said,
the primary impact of conversion on patient volume is almost exclusively through the CAH
variable and not through bed size.34 Hence, we do not separately report the effects of bed
size on volume.
Tables 7 and 8 show that CAH conversion significantly reduced patient volume and those
reductions differ across payor class, diagnoses, and MDC.35 Using the sample with all patients
and the specification with beds, CAH conversion reduces admissions, on average, by 4.7
percent. For the sample with all patients and the specification without beds, the estimated
average reduction in admissions is slightly higher, at 5.0 percent.
33

We have also calculated the change in volume from a given hospital’s conversion assuming that no other
hospital converted. These estimate look very similar to those presented in Tables 7 and 8. The differences
are generally less than one percentage point.
34
For instance, for the sample with all patients, the change in bed size to 25 decreased volume slightly by
0.3 percent.
35
We do not present standard errors as that would require bootstrapping or constructing high dimensional
simulation from the asymptotic distribution of the parameters. Both of these approaches are very computationally intensive and would likely take many months to calculate on our computer cluster. We do note
that most of the parameter estimates from the choice model are precisely estimated suggesting that these
estimated effects should also be precisely estimated.

28

The impact of conversion differs by the principal payor and specific condition. On average, using the specification with beds, conversion reduces Medicare volume by approximately 5.2 percent and privately insured volume by approximately 4.5 percent. Across the
specific diagnoses, the largest reduction from conversion occurred in AMI patients and the
smallest reduction was for pneumonia patients. These results align with the goals of the program to direct more acutely ill patients requiring more aggressive medical interventions away
from CAHs. Most AMI patients are treated with reperfusion therapy, such as percutaneous
coronary interventions (PCI) or clot-busting drugs. PCIs require the presence of a cardiac
catheterization lab and the procedure is performed by an interventional cardiologist, neither
of which are available to most CAHs. Of course, the treatment of AMI is time sensitive
and it is possible that rural AMI patients are traveling further to receive care because of
CAH conversion. Across MDCs, there is also significant variation in the volume response to
conversion. The largest conversion response is for the Injuries MDC (a 12.2 percent decline)
and the smallest decline is for the Respiratory MDC (2.9 percent decline). The estimates of
the impact of CAH conversions without beds are, in general, very similar to the estimates
from the base specification.
In sum, CAH conversion reduces the value that patients place on converting hospitals.
There is heterogeneity in the impact across patients with different health insurance arrangements and diagnoses, with the biggest outliers being conditions of pneumonia, AMI, and the
MDC of injuries. It is possible that the negative impact of CAH conversion is driven by
the negative perception of quality of treatment in converted hospitals due to the findings in
the medical literature (e.g. Joynt et al., 2011; Lutfiyya et al., 2007). Our results show that
these findings are confirmed by patient choice data taking into account the heterogeneity of
hospitals prior to conversion.
To understand the net impact of the Flex Program requires comparing this static welfare
loss to any potential consumer surplus gained from the program forestalling exit. We explore

29

that question next.

Consumer Welfare Effects of the Flex Program

One of the principal goals of the Flex Program is to prevent rural hospital exit. As we have
shown above, conversion to CAH status reduces patient utility. In our first welfare analysis,
we quantify the loss in consumer welfare from CAH conversion using a distance metric. The
policy tension in the Flex Program is between the increase in consumer surplus attributable
30

to maintaining access to these hospitals by preventing exit and the decrease in consumer
surplus associated with CAH conversion. In our second welfare analysis, we calculate the
reduction in average entry rates over our sample period necessary for the Flex Program to
increase rural resident welfare. We are only focused on consumer surplus in these analyses
and do not attempt to account for the costs of administering the program, the costs of CAH
conversion, changes in hospital profits, and changes in insurer profits. Our welfare effects use
the estimates from our specification with beds from the entire sample (column 1 of Table 6)
but our results are very similar to those from the specification without beds.36
We first compute the distance that leaves the patient indifferent between a non-CAH with
a capacity of 42 beds (the mean size of CAHs prior to conversion) and a CAH with 25 beds
and the same other characteristics. Specifically, using equation (1), we find the decrease in
distance, ∆dist, that makes a patient with DRG weight 1 indifferent between admission to a
CAH and a non-CAH for a given set of hospital characteristics. That is, we find the value of
∆dist∗ that solves δijt (CAH = 1, beds = 25, dist − ∆dist∗ ) = δijt (CAH = 0, beds = 42, dist)
where δijt (·) is the mean utility function, evaluated at the estimated parameter values and
with the noted values of CAH and bed size.
Because preferences are nonlinear in distance, we examine two cases: a hospital that is 10
km (6.2 miles) away from a patient and the closest to the patient’s home and a hospital that
is located 25 km (15.7 miles) away and not the closest to the patient’s home. In the first case,
patients with DRG weight 1 would be indifferent between the hospital converting to CAH
status and moving 0.88 km (0.55 miles) closer to their home and the hospital not converting
and remaining where it is. In the second case, patients would be indifferent between the
hospital converting and moving 1.48 km (0.92 miles) closer to their home and the hospital
not converting and remaining where it is. Thus, according to this distance metric, the welfare
loss from conversion is modest but meaningful.

To implement our second and principal welfare analysis, we calculate the mean consumer
surplus under different hospital exit scenarios over the entire period for hospitals that converted. We also calculate the mean distance to the closest hospital and average distance
traveled to the chosen hospital. As we are interested in comparing the welfare under the
Flex Program to the counterfactual in which the Flex Program was not enacted, our counterfactual considers the case where there are no CAHs and converting hospitals are assigned
their pre-conversion capacity. In order to avoid having to estimate a dynamic firm model of
exit in the absence of the Flex Program, we consider scenarios where the likelihood of exit is
random across CAHs.
The results from this welfare analysis are presented in Figure 3. In the figure, we graph the
percentage change in consumer surplus, distance to closest hospital, and distance to chosen
hospital relative to those values under the Flex Program. The results in Figure 3 highlight
the policy tension in the Flex Program. The break-even point for consumer surplus is an exit
probability of approximately 6.5 percent. In other words, if the CAH program forestalled a
random 6.5 percent or more of exit among CAH converters, its impact on consumer surplus
for rural residents would be weakly positive. Moreover, our assumption that the set of exiting
hospitals is conditionally random likely makes the above figure conservative, in the sense that
the program was likely consumer welfare improving even if the forestalled exit among CAH
converters was somewhat less than 6.5 percent.37
By construction, for all strictly positive averted exit probabilities, exit of CAHs would
have resulted in an increase in the mean distance to the closest hospital. Exit of CAHs would
have also resulted in an increase in the mean distance to the chosen hospital, but with a much
less steep slope as a function of exit. The slope is less steep because of the fact that patients
are willing to travel longer distance to avoid CAHs. At the break-even consumer welfare
37

Extra exit in the absence of the CAH program would have likely occurred by hospitals that were less
valued than average by patients. Thus, if we were to endogenize the exit decision in the absence of the CAH
program with a model of firm exit, instead of calculating a random exit decision, an averted 6.5 percent exit
probability would likely be strictly welfare improving.

32

averted exit probability of 6.5 percent, mean distance to the closest hospital would have been
about 5.2 percent higher and mean distance to the chosen hospital about 2.5 percent higher
in the absence of the Flex Program.
Determining the counterfactual exit probability is challenging and requires solving for
exit decisions by firms in the absence of the Flex Program, which in turn requires modeling
the dynamic oligopoly interactions of hospitals. This is a task that we take up in companion
work (Gowrisankaran et al., 2010).

Conclusions

This paper estimated the impact of the Medicare Rural Flexibility Program on the demand
for inpatient services. We find that patients are willing to travel significant distances to avoid
visiting a Critical Access Hospital that faces LOS restrictions and consequently specializes
in a limited range of services. The reduction of bed capacity to fulfill the CAH bed limit
of 25 beds appears to have affected patient choice only in a minor fashion. We examine to
what extent the impact of CAH conversion varies by condition and type of health insurance
33

arrangement. The results suggest that while the magnitude of the CAH effect varies by
condition, CAH conversion reduces the desirability of a hospital across most conditions and
health insurance arrangements.
We calculate that the consumer welfare loss from CAH conversion will offset reduced
exit from the Flex Program if a random 6.5 percent of CAH converters would have exited
in the absence of the program. Changes in the quality of care provided by these hospitals
may swamp the dimensions of welfare we consider here. In ongoing research, we examine
the quality consequences of the Flex Program. While understanding the impact of the Flex
Program on rural hospital exit is beyond the scope of this paper, Gowrisankaran et al. (2010)
specify a dynamic oligopoly model with hospital exit and conversion to CAH status. Their
aim is to compute counterfactual equilibrium market structures in order to examine the
impact of eliminating and modifying the Flex Program on access to hospitals and patient
welfare.
