Job Characteristics and Hours of Work

ABSTRACT

This paper provides evidence that hours of work are heavily influenced by
the particular job which a person holds. The empirical work consists of a
comparison of the variance in the change in work hours across time intervals
containing a job change with the variance in the change in hours across time
periods when the job remains the same. To the extent that workers choose
hours and these hours choices are influenced by shifts in individual
preferences and resources, the variance in the time change of hours should not
depend upon whether the worker has switched jobs. The desire to reduce or
increase hours could be acted upon in the current job. On the other hand, if
hours are influenced by employer preferences or if job specific
characteristics dominate the labor supply decision, then hours changes should
be larger when persons change jobs than when they do not. Using the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics and the Quality of Employment Survey, we find that
hours changes are typically two to four times more variable across jobs than
within jobs. This result holds for both men and women and for both quits and
layoffs, is obtained for weeks per year, hours per week, and annual hours, and
is not sensitive to the use of controls for a set of job characteristics
(including the wage) which might influence the level of hours persons wish to
supply. The findings are also inconsistent with the view that workers may
costlessly adjust hours by changing jobs.
The finding that the job has a large influence on work hours suggests
that much greater emphasis should be given to demand factors and to job
specific labor supply factors in future research on hours of work. The
overwhelming emphasis upon the wage and personal characteristics in
conventional labor supply analyses of work hours may in part be misplaced.

Introduction

Most empirical studies of hours of work, and virtually all based upon
micro data, have assumed that observed hours represent the labor supply

decisions of workers. In a conventional labor supply framework work hours are
determined as the quantity of labor the worker chooses to sell given

preferences, wages, and non—labor income in current and future periods. The
focus upon the labor supply model is due in part to intense interest in the
responsiveness of hours to wages and taxes and to lack of micro data on firm

characteristics. Many refinements of the basic labor supply model and
improvements in econometric techniques have been made during the past fifteen

years. But despite these advances, the recent surveys by Ashenfelter (1984)
and Pencavel (1984) conclude that (1) there is considerable variation across

studies in estimates of the response of hours to wages, nonlabor income, and
demographic characteristics emphasized in the studies and (2) existing labor
supply models explain little of the variation in hours across workers and very
little of the variation in hours over time for a given worker.1

One obvious response to the current shortcomings of the literature is to
continue to refine labor supply models and estimation techniques and, perhaps
most importantly, to obtain more comprehensive and reliable data on hours,

budget parameters, and personal characteristics. A second response,
complementary to the first, is to explore the possibility that non—wage
characteristics associated with specific jobs, such as working conditions,
commuting time, and job hazards, are key determinants of labor supply

preferences. In this view, empirical labor supply studies are basically on
the right track but have emphasized the wrong set of variables. A third
response, which is attracting growing support among labor economists, is to

—2—
conclude that the labor supply model is fundamentally inadequate as a model of

hours determination, and to emphasize the role of employer preferences in the

determination of hours. The second and third responses are very different,
but both involve a shift in emphasis from worker characteristics to job

specific characteristics as the key determinants of work hours. This paper
examines the extent to which hours are in fact influenced by (non—wage)

characteristics of the job which affect the labor supply preferences of the
worker and/or are influenced by employer preferences for hours.

To set the stage for the analysis, a brief discussion of existing studies
of the importance of job specific labor supply and labor demand considerations

in hours determination is in order. The comprehensive surveys by
Killingsworth (1983) and Pencavel (1984) cite few studies which have examined
the influence on hours of job characteristics (other than wages and fringe

benefits such as pensions)which might be expected to affect labor supply.
Atrostic (1982) shows that an index of job attributes plays a significant role
in a demand system for work hours, job attributes, and nonlabor income.2 Her

results suggest that job attributes do affect the form of the labor supply
function and consequently influence the hours chosen given the level of

nonlabor income and the wage. However, Atrostic does not examine whether the
job attributes have much explanatory power. A number of cross section studies
have added occupation or industry variables to standard labor supply models as

partial controls for job attributes. These variables play a significant role,
although they are subject to demand as well as supply interpretations and may
capture the effects of omitted personal characteristics which happen to be
associated with occupation or industry.

Casual empiricism suggests that firms have strong preferences about

employee hours. These preferences arise in part from technological

—3--

considerations such as hiring and training costs which are fixed per employee
and the costs of coordinating the activities of workers who work different

numbers of hours.3 Also, due to start—up costs and fatigue, productivity per
hour may be low both for employees who only work a few hours a week and for

employees who work a large number of hours. Furthermore, fringe benefits and
government mandated payroll taxes which are assessed on a per worker basis

introduce nonlinearity in the relationship between hours and compensation. If
the preferences of employees and/or the hours required by employers vary over
time, and if mobility costs prevent workers from quickly moving to firms which
offer the hours level workers prefer, then observed hours do not represent
points on a labor supply function and consequently may be difficult to explain
with a labor supply model.

The implications of employer preferences for the analysis of labor supply
and hours of work have been explored in a number of recent empirical
studies. Rosen (1976), Moff it (1983), and Lundberg (1984) are among a handful
of papers which have estimated labor supply models in which the worker faces a

nonlinear schedule relating the wage rate to hours of work. Abowd and
Ashenfelter (1981) and a subsequent study by Topel (1983) examine the idea
that firms offer workers hours—wage packages in the context of studies of

compensating differentials for unemployment risk. Ehrenberg and Schumann
(1984) use a similar framework to investigate compensating differentials for

mandatory overtime. Ashenfelter (1980), Ham (1982, 1986) and a number of
other recent studies have examined whether unemployment is best interpreted as

a constraint on choice of hours.4 Finally, hours—wage packages have been the
subject of much theoretical speculation in the implicit contracts literature.5
While an important beginning has been made, research on the empirical

implications of hours—wage packages is in an early stage of development. It

—4—

is

unclear whether employer preferences for hours determinants play a

quantitatively significant role in hours determination. Even less is known
about the importance of job related labor supply determinants, aside from the

effect of the wago rate and fringe benefits such as pensions. To guide
research on structural labor supply, labor demand, and contracts models of

hours, it would be useful to provide an empirical assessment of whether or
not job characteristics are a dominant influence on hours.
We shed light on the issue by establishing the following fact about the

structure of hours: a large fraction of the variance of work hours is
associated with jobs.6 Specifically, we compare the variance of the change in
hours across time periods when people switch jobs with the variance in the

change in hours across time periods when the job does not change. Shifts in
job specific hours requirements will be larger when the job changes than when

it does not. Shifts in job specific labor supply characteristics are also
likely to be larger when the job changes than when it does not. For these
reasons, one would expect hours to be more variable across jobs than within
jobs if hours requirements and/or job specific labor supply determinants are

important. On the other hand, if workers may freely vary hours on a given job
and labor supply depends largely on personal characteristics rather than job

characteristics, then the magnitude of observed hours shifts (controlling for
the effects of wage changes) should not be sensitive to whether or not the job
changes.

Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Quality
of Employment Survey (QES), we find that the variance of the hours change is

between two and four times as large for those who have switched jobs as for

those who are in the same job. This result holds for both men and women, is
obtained for weeks per year, hours per week, and annual hours, and is not

—5—
sensitive to the use of controls for a detailed set of job characteristics

which might influence the workerTh desired hours. Furthermore, the results do
not appear to arise from heterogeneity in the underlying variance in desired
hours for workers who change jobs frequently relative to workers who do not.

We also investigate whether the findings are consistent with a model in
which hours in a given job are determined by employer preferences, but each
worker may cheaply locate and move to firms which offer hours equal to the

desired hours level. In such a model, hours choices would still reflect the
preferences of workers, who would simply change jobs when they wish to make

large adjustments in hours. By analyzing quits and layoffs separately, we are
able to reject such a model.
Our results show that characteristics of jobs play a very important role

in the determination of hours. We wish to emphasize, however, that they do
not establish whether the job characteristics represent constraints on hours
imposed by the firm, unobserved job characteristics which influence hours

desired by the worker, or a combination of the two. There is of course a big
gap between the data analysis in the paper and a satisfactory structural

analysis of hours determination. However, our finding that the job has a
large influence on work hours suggests that structural models of hours of work
should give much more emphasis to demand factors and to job specific supply
factors.

The paper procedes as follows. Section 2 provides motivation for the
empirical work by discussing the implications of alternative models of hours

determination for the variance in hours within and across jobs. Section 3
discusses the data used in the analysis and a variety of econometric issues.

Section 4 presents the empirical results. The paper concludes with a brief
summary of the findings and their implication for future research on hours of

—6--

work.

2. Implications of Models of Hours Determination for the Variance of Hours
Changes within and Across Jobs

Let

denote the change in the log of hours between period t and t—k for

individual i when the same job was held in both periods. Let

denote

the hours change for individual i if a job change occurred. Let Var(.) denote
the variance function. The empirical work in the paper focuses primarily on

comparisons Var(H) with Var(tHt).
Although the paper focusses on comparison of hours changes within and

across jobs, no formal model of mobility is presented. The implicit view
underlying our work is that workers weigh many job attributes in making
mobility decisions, including wages, promotion possibilities, working

conditions, fringe benefits, and locational preferences, To the extent that
hours cannot be chosen on the job, the shifts in hours requirements of a job
relative to individual labor supply preferences may play a key role in job

mobility. The extent of mobility and the ability of heterogenous workers to
locate job packages which are most suitable to them along all dimensions is

influenced by search costs and mobility costs. Finally, a substantial
fraction of mobility arises exogenously through layoffs and is not related to
hours preferences of the worker.
In the remainder of this section , we discuss four alternative models of
hours determination, and derive their implications for the difference in the

variances of hours changes across and within jobs. We refer to the models as
LS—PC, LS—JC, LD—IM, and LD—PM.

Model LS—PC is a conventional labor supply model in which employers

—7—
permit workers to freely choose work hours at a parametric wage and personal

characteristics are key labor supply determinants. Model LS—JC is a
conventional labor supply model in which workers may choose hours but hours
preferences are heavily influenced by job—specific characteristics, in

addition to personal characteristics. Model LD—IM is a "labor demand—

imperfect mobility" model N which hours on a given job are determined by
employer preferences, and mobility costs and imperfect information prevent

workers from avoiding hours constraints through costless job mobility. Model
LD—PM is a "labor demand—perfect job mobility" model in which hours in a given
job are determined by employer preferences, but workers may costlessly locate
and move to firms offering hours which are equal to the desired hours level.
Suppose that workers are free to choose hours within jobs, and hours
choices are influenced primarily by the wage rate, individual (i.e. non—job—

related) preferences and resources, as in model LS—PC. Then the variance of
the change in hours should depend on whether or not the job has changed only

to the extent that the wage varies more across jobs than within jobs. To take
the simplest example, suppose an individual faces the same wage in all jobs.
Then, since individuals may freely choose hours, the desire to reduce or

increase hours could always be acted on within the current job. Conversely, a
change of job, all preferences being equal, would result in no change of

hours. Of course, there is evidence (Cline (1979), and Freeman (1980)) that
wages do vary across jobs, and that the variance of the wage change is higher

when the job changes than when it does not. This implies that the variance of
hours changes will be higher across jobs than within jobs. However, under LS—
PC, the component of the desired supply of hours which is not related to the

wage should have the same variance within and across jobs. In sum, if LS—PC
Is correct, and if one first adjusts hours to account for the effect of the

—8—
wage rate on labor supply, then Var(H) should be similar to Var(LH).
On the other hand, both LS—JC and LD—IM imply that Var(H1) will
exceed

even when the wage is controlled for. However, LS—JC and

LD—IM involve very different sources of the underlying variance of hours. If
LD—IM is correct, differences across firms in the demand for hours will cause

the variability of hours to be greater when the job changes than when it does

not. If LS—JC is correct, differences across firms in characteristics

affecting labor supply may cause Var(LHt) to exceed Var(LHit) .

This

would be the case if many non—wage labor supply determinants, such as working
conditions and travel time, vary more when the job changes than when it does

not. Thus, to distinguish between LS—JC and LD—IM one must first adjust hours
measures for the effects of job—related labor—supply determinants and then
compare the variances of these adjusted measures within and across jobs.

Model LD—PM also implies that Var(Ht) will exceed Var(1Hjt). Model
LD—PM is a demand model in the sense that observed hours are always in accord

with the employers preferences. However, the assumption that mobility costs
are low and information about job openings is very rich implies that workers

simply change jobs when they wish to change work hours. In the LD—PM model
employer preferences for hours influences job selection but not work hours.
For purposes of conducting labor supply analysis, LD—PM is similar to LS—PC

(although LD—PM has very different implications for mobility).7 However,
under LD—PM the fact that workers must change jobs to change hours implies

that Var(LH'jt) will exceed Var(H±t) even if hours are determined entirely
by worker preferences.

In sum, a finding that Var(H±t) exceeds Var(AHjt) (after controlling
for the effects of wages on hours) would provide evidence against LS—PC.

However, the finding would not permit one to distinguish among the other three

—9—
models. It could be that job—specific labor supply preferences, employer
preferences, or even, in the case of LD—PM, individual specific labor supply
preferences are the underlying source of the higher cross job variance of

hours changes. In Section 2.1 we provide a more formal discussion of the
issues involved in discriminating between LS—JC and LD—IM, under the

assumption that LD—PM is not correct. In Section 2.2, we suggest a method for
testing whether LD—PM is a reasonable explanation for the excess variance of
hours across jobs.

2.1. Distinguishing between the Labor Supply—Job Characteristics and Labor
Demand—Imperfect Mobility Models.

Assume that mobility and search costs are substantial, so that LD—PM is

incorrect. Models LS—JC and LD—IM may be tested by adjusting for the effects
of job—specific labor supply determinants. If LS—JC is correct, then the
variance of hours changes after controlling for the effects of job—specific
labor supply determinants should not depend on whether or not the job has

changed. A finding that the variance of hours changes across jobs exceeds the
variance of hours changes within jobs even after adjusting hours for job—
specific labor supply determinants provides evidence in favor of LD—IM.

The importance of using adjusted hours measures when drawing inferences

about LS—JC and LD—IM from Var(zH..) and Var(H1.), and the appropriate
adjustment to hours may be demonstrated using the following simple model of

hours determination. The model is general in nature, and is little more than
a framework for measurement. By imposing restrictions on the coefficients of
the model, one can obtain a model in which hours are supply determined, demand

determined, or some combination of both. Since in this paper we do not
attempt to estimate structural models of hours determination, there is little

— 10 —

point

in presenting the underlying optimizations (on the part of firms and

workers) which would yield such models of hours determination. However, in
Appendix 1, we work through a specific example and show that the model in the
text nests intertemporal labor supply models similar to those used by MaCurdy
(1981) and Altonji (1986) and others, demand models such as those discussed by
Lewis (1971) and Rosen (1969), and contracts models of hours determination of
the type discussed by Rosen (1985) and Abowd and Card (1985a,b).

that hours are determined both by employer and employee preferences. For
example, an implicit contracts model in which the marginal utility of income
is equated with the marginal product of labor will result in hours which are
determined by a weighted average of firm and worker preferences. (See the
Appendix.)

Given that the wage rate, job related labor supply determinants, and
labor demand determinants in (4b) are all likely to vary more when the job

changes than when it does not, LS—JC, LD—IM, and even LS—PC (because of the
wage rate in the case LS—PC) are potentially consistent with an excess of

var(Hjt) over var(LHt). Suppose, however, that we adjust the changes in
hours measures to take into account the effects of the wage rate and job

related labor supply determinants. Assume, for the moment, that w1t and all

It is reasonable to assume that the autocovariance of time varying demand
determinants is larger within the same job than across jobs, in which case

cov(d, djt_k) —

cov(d,

dj-t_k) is positive. Furthermore,

var(d)_ cov(d, d3-) is necessarily positive, which follows from the Cauchy

Schwartz inequality since var(d) and var(d_) are the same. This leads to
the conclusion that if hours are employer determined, the difference between
the variances of adjusted hours changes within and across jobs should be

positive, whereas if hours are employee determined this difference should be

equal to 0. Thus, by adjusting hours measures one may in principle isolate
the importance of employer preferences in hours variation.

We have assumed, so far, that all elements of

are observed.

Although our data sets contain several personal and job related labor supply
determinants, they provide little information on expectations of wages and
nonlabor income in future periods, the work environment, travel time, job
security, and other personal and job related non—wage factors which influence

labor supply. To account for the fact that many labor supply determinants are
not observed, we modify equation (3) in the following way. Partition

where we have assumed that the fixed job specific supply components

periods. That is, the difference in the variance of hours changes across and
within jobs may be positive if there are unobserved job—related factors

affecting labor supply. The difference would arise in part from the variance
across jobs in the unobserved permanent determinants of labor supply to a
particular job, and in part from the fact that the autocovariance of time—
varying job specific labor supply determinants is likely to be larger within

— 15 —

jobs

than across jobs.

The implications of the above model for the empirical analysis below may

be summarized as follows. First, if LS—PC is correct (hours are supply
determined and non—wage job characteristics have little effect on labor
supply), then the difference between the variance of adjusted hours changes
across and within jobs should still be 0 despite the presence of unobserved

personal characteristics. Thus, a finding that var(Lth..) —

var(h..)

is

substantially larger than 0 is evidence against this simplest model of

hours.'° Second, if LS—JC is correct, var(h..) —

var(h..)

may be

positive if unobserved job—related labor supply determinants are important.
Thus, the finding that the variance of hours changes is much larger across
jobs than within jobs provides evidence in favor LD—IM over LS—JC only insofar

as we have been able to control for all relevant labor supply determinants. A
final interpretation of our results will await development and estimation of
structural hours models incorporating both job spec-if ic labor supply

determinants and labor demand determinants.

2.2. Testing the Labor Demand—Perfect Job Mobility Model
The LD—PM ("labor demand—perfect job mobility") model is a fourth

possible model of hours determination. In this model, hours worked in a
particular job are dictated by the firm in accordance with (2), but workers
may costlessly exercise their labor supply preferences by moving across jobs

even though they cannot vary hours within jobs. Given no search or mobility
costs the worker will change jobs when H.. lit

Even though hours

are determined by the demand equation (2), the characteristics Dt of the job
chosen by the worker will implicitly depend upon the workers labor supply

— 16 —

preferences. The term var(LHj) is likely to be larger
than var(H1.), since workers must change jobs to change hours. However,
labor supply preferences, rather than firm preferences, would underlie the

difference between var(tHjt) and var(iHt). Furthermore, the excess of
var(Hjt) over var(1Hjjt) would arise even if labor supply preferences were
not affected by job characteristics.

Of course, if mobility and information costs are literally 0, then from

the workers point of view there is no meaningful distinction between varying
hours within a firm and varying hours across firms. In fact, the substantial
length of time workers spend on jobs, the evidence of substantial dispersion
in wages across jobs offering similar characteristics, and the significant
amount of time workers spend in job search suggests that mobility costs and

information costs are substantial. In this situation observed hours—wage
combinations will not necessarily lie on the labor supply function. Workers
will choose the best combination of hours, wage income, and other job
characteristics available at a particular time, and employer preferences will

have an independent influence on work hours. In summary, LD—PM is not

plausible as a full explanation for a large difference between var(Ht) and

var(H). However, it may be a partial explanation.
To help discriminate the LD—PM model from LD—IM and LS—JC, we compare

Var(H) for the subset of job changes resulting from layoffs with
Var(AHjt). In making this comparison we assume that the occurrence of
layoffs are not correlated with changes in labor supply preferences. If this
assumption is correct and LD—PM is correct, then workers who experience a
layoff will pick new jobs offering an hours level similar to their old job,

and so Var(H') should be similar to Var(iH1t). (Hours are measured such
that hours of unemployment directly associated with layoffs should not affect

— 17 —

the hours change measures.) If LD—IM is correct, then the best new job that
the worker is able to find after a layoff may require an hours level different

from hours on the previous job, in which case Var(H1t) will exceed
Var(H1t). If mobility and search are costly and LS—JC are correct, then the
wage and non—wage characteristics of the laid off workers best offer may

induce a change in the workerTh supply of hours. As a result, Var(H)

will also exceed Var(H).

3. Data and Econometric Issues

3.1 Data
The major data source is the first fourteen waves (1968—1981) of the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID, Survey Research Center (1982)).

Observations for a particular year were included only if the individual was
between the ages of 18 and 60, inclusive, was not retired, and worked positive

hours in that year. Observations were excluded from the sample if total
annual hours worked on all jobs exceeded 5,000. The sample sizes for the
procedures are reported in the tables below. They vary considerably due to
differences in the availability of data for men, unmarried women, and married
women, which we analyze separately, and due to missing data on particular
variables.

The second data source, the Quality of Employment Survey (QES, Quinn and

Staines (1979)), consists of two waves (1973 and 1977). After exclusions due
to missing data our QES sample contains 280 white males between the ages of 17

and 64. The QES contains more information on characteristics of the job which
may affect labor supply than does the PSID, although the small size of the QES
sample is a disadvantage.

Most of the variables used are self—explanatory and are listed in Table

— 18 —

1.

The PSID measures of annual work hours on the main job, weeks/year worked

on the main

job,

and hours/week on the main job require discussion. Since we

wish to distinguish between changes in hours worked which occur within and
between jobs, it is important that the hours measures used pertain to one main

job only. All hours variables refer to the full calendar year prior to the

survey. Consequently, if a separation occurred in the calendar year prior to
the survey, the hours measures represent a mixture of hours worked on two

sequential jobs. For the PSID, this problem is compounded by the fact that
the separation variable indicates whether a job change occurred in the year

prior to the survey date (typial1y March) rather than the previous calandar
year.

As a result of this inconsistency in timing of the hours and separation
variables, to obtain change in hours measures which are unambiguously either

"within job" or "between job", one must use the hours change over a three year

gap. That is, we base the hour change measures on

—

HiJt_3,

where J is

the job index in t—k. (J=j if the job has not changed and equals j if the job
has changed). We also must exclude observations if the individual indicates a
change of job in survey time periods t, t—1, t—3, t—4.12 We determine whether
Hijt—HjJt_3 is "within't or "between" jobs by examining whether a separation

occurred in time t—2 and set

or

equal to Hijt—HjJt_3

accordingly.

This method of computing the hours change has two disadvantages. The
first is that many observations are eliminated; the maximum possible number of
observations per individual falls from 13 to 9, since Hjjt—HjJt_3 cannot be

computed if t < 1971. The second and more serious problem is that the sample
becomes biased towards individuals who do not change jobs frequently: if an
individual changes jobs in year t and again in year t+2, then the values of

— 19 —

hjjt—hjjt_3

will be set to missing for the time periods t through t+3, because

none of these hours measures are truly "clean". Since there is no clear—cut
answer to this problem we present results from the PSID using both one and
three year changes in hours.

We also present results when tH.. and H. are based on
ljt

Ht

—HjJt.....5. In this case we set

—

HjJt_5 to missing if a job change is

reported for times t, t—1, t—5 or t—6. The change in hours is coded as a
"between job" change if a separation occurred in t—2, t—3, and/or t—4. Thus,
multiple separations are possible.

For unmarried women, the change in hours is also computed over one, three

and five year gaps. Observations were set to missing if the woman was married
in any of the years used to compute the change in hours. The PSID data for
married women contain information on separations from employer only in 1976,

1979, 1980 and 1981. Because of these data limitations, we work with

—

HiJt..1.
For the QES, Hjjt and Hjjt are based on hours in 1977 minus hours in
1973. Only one hours measure, average hours per week, is available. The
effective QES sample sizes for unmarried and married women are too small to
support an analysis.

3.2 Adjustment of the Hours Change Measures for Job—related Determinants
of Labor Supply.
As was mentioned earlier, to the extent that job—related variables which

might be related to labor supply can be controlled for, var(h'1) —

var(h) will provide a better indication of the importance of firm
preferences for hours. The hours adjustment is based upon estimates of the
following equation for the unadjusted change in Hut:

— 20 —

a5

{SEPNJ +

+ a3Ixjt + a4
+

Ujjt

+

aix + a2wt +

a [SEPNI Wjt

+ a {SEPN] Xjjt

IEijt.

SEPN is a separation indicator, and equals 1 if the employer changed between t

and t—k and is 0 otherwise. The variable uj is a composite error component
for omitted variables. The model of hours changes implies that the variance
of ujj. depends upon whether or not a separation has occurred. The error
component

is measurement error in the hours change variable. We assume

not a
ijt has mean 0 and a variance which does not depend on whether or
separation has occurred. In this case the presence of the measurement error

ijt adds an extra term to var(LFIit) and var(FIjjt) but does not affect
the difference between them. To examine the effects of measurement error on
the unadjusted hours measures we use the covariances of two independent

measures of the change in annual hours to provide alternative estimates of

var(Hijt) and var(M-Ijjt). These

estimates should be less affected by

measurement error. We do in fact find that both variances decline
substantially and that the difference between them rises relative to

var(H1t).
For the PSID, x includes variables for age, race, and years of
education. These are included because they may affect the average change in

hours. The variable x includes changes in marital status, number of
children, a dummy variable indicating the presence of pre—school aged

children, health status, and non—labor income (which includes a spouseTh labor

income, if any). The variable xjjt includes changes in union membership and
changes in 1 digit occupation indicators.

Since we are looking at changes in

hours with and without changes in employer rather than position,

it is

possible that occupation changes when no separation occurs. The changes in
the level and in the square of annual hours of unemployment are also included

— 21 —

in
The equation for the QES contains basically the same variables, with the

following exceptions. First,

is the log of annual earnings. Second,

data on changes in non—labor income were not available. Third, seventeen
additional variables pertaining to changes in the characteristics of jobs were

added. These variables include items such change in commuting time, required
work effort, vacation pay, training possibilities, and job security.'3
Under the null hypothesis that hours are supply determined, (8) is
similar to the first difference labor supply equations estimated by MaCurdy
(1981), Altonji (1984) and others, although none of the previous intertemporal

labor studies distinguish between changes in hours with and without job

changes. Those familiar with the intertemporal labor supply literature will

note that the coefficients a2, a3, a and a each contain a component which
measures the direct effect of the variable on the change in hours, and a
component which measures the indirect effect through the marginal utility of

income. However, unlike the studies cited above, we do not attempt to
distinguish between the two effects when estimating the change in hours
equations, since only the total effect of

and

is required to

adjust the hours data. If all the personal and job related determinants of
labor supply (including expectational variables) were observed, then aside
from approximation error associated with log linear specification of (8), the

coefficients would not depend on whether or not a separation occurs. We allow
the coefficients to depend on SEPN because the association of the observed job
related variables (eg., the wage change) with unobserved variables (eg., the
change in expectations of future wages) may depend upon whether or not a
separation has occurred.

We estimate (8) by weighted least squares for the QES, and weighted two

— 22 —

for the
stage least squares for the PSID.14 Two stage least squares is used
PSID to minimize estimation bias which arises from the fact that the principal
wage measure in the PSID is annual earnings divided by annual hours worked.

The change in the reported hourly wage, as well as all other variables in
equations (8) are used as instrumental variables for wjti5 It should be
emphasized that noise in wages and the other variables limits our ability to

control even for tobservedIt determinants of labor supply. When estimating (8)
with the QES data, we constrain the coefficients on job—related variables to
be the same for observations with and without job changes.

Given the large

and the fact that the QES

contains only 67 observations on job changes, this measure is necessary to
conserve degrees of freedom.

For one set of estimates we also adjust for the change in annual hours of

unemployment. The estimates of a few of the equations used to perform the
adjustments are reported in Tables Al and A2 and discussed in a footnote.16
The use of two—stage least squares reduces the problem of measurement

error bias in the estimation of a2 and a2. But because the wage measure is

earnings divided by hours, measurement error in hours affects tht and
both directly and through the adjustment for the wage change. Consequently,

it may produce biases in the estimates of var(ht) var(h4t) and the
difference between the two. Measurement error in earnings which is
independent of measurement error in hours may also affect the variances of the

adjusted hours measures. In a footnote we show that measurement error in

— 23 —

hours and in earnings are likely to increase the variance of adjusted hours
both within and across jobs.17 Furthermore, unless a2 is equal to 0, these
additional variance components will not cancel out when computing the

difference between the cross job and within job variances. Depending on the
values of a2 and a2, measurement error could cause the difference between the
cross job and within job variances to be either upward or downward biased.

Given the estimates of a2 and a2 which we obtain, these issues are important
only for married females, and are discussed in footnote 27 below.

estimates for k=5 are qualitatively similar to these, while the results for

show that var(Hjt) is 2.2 times as large as var(H1t).
The findings for weeks per year and hours per year also show that there

are important job specific components to the variance of hours. For weeks per

figures for annual hours are similar.

(.004)

Other studies have found evidence that measurement error in the hours

level is important in PSID. (See Duncan and Hill (1984)). As mentioned

earlier, this is likely to inflate both var(Ht) and var(iHt) but should
not have much effect on the difference between them. If measurement error is
important, the estimates in the table may substantially understate the value

of var(Ht) —

var(Hjt)

relative to var(LH1t). Consequently, our results

probably understate the importance of job specific factors in hours changes.
We have obtained some evidence on the importance of measurement error

using the following procedure. Workers who are paid by the hour are asked to
report their straight time hourly wage. By dividing labor earnings by the
straight time wage, one may obtain an alternative measure of annual hours.

This alternative measure is not based upon the questions about hours per week
and weeks worked which are used to construct the direct measure of annual

hours. Thus, there Is some basis for assuming that the measurement errors in
the two annual hours measures are independent, at least for hourly workers.
In this case, the covariance of the changes in the two hours measures over
intervals with a job change and without a job change will provide estimates of

Var(tH't) and Var(H1t) which are not affected by measurement error.

The table below reports estimates of Var(Ht) Var(1Ht) and

Var(1Hit) — Var(LH1t) for a sample of workers who were paid by the hour in
both t and t—3. The sample sizes for the variances across and within jobs are

— 25 —

164 and 3878 respectively. The results using the imputed measure of annual
hours and the direct measure are similar and correspond reasonably closely to

the results for the full sample in Table 2. The last column reports estimates
based on the covariances of the two alternative measures of the hours

change. The estimates of Var(IH±t) and Var(tiH) fall to .235 and .037.
Comparison of the middle and last columns suggests that almost half of the
within job variance in the direct measure of hours is measurement error.

These findings indicate that for annual hours Var(1H'1t) is

6.3

times as large as Var(MI±t). This ratio is considerably larger than the
values of 3.3 and 4.3 based upon columns 1 and 2 respectively. This evidence
suggests that measurement error in hours does in fact lead to an
understatement of the relative importance of job specific factors in hours

changes. The results also provide evidence against the possibility that our
findings could be explained through a mechanism in which the variance in the
is larger when the job has changed than when it

has not.

Results Using the Adjusted Hours Measures
The second and third panels of Table 2 report the results for var(hjt)

and var(ihjt) where Ehjt and

changes after adjustment for job specific labor supply determinants by the
method described in Section 3.2.
The middle panel of Table 2 contains the results using hours measures
which have been adjusted for observed job specific determinants of hours, but

have not been adjusted for hours of unemployment. The results for the PSID
data are very similar to those based on the unadjusted hours measures. They
indicate that hours responses to wage changes, changes in union membership,
and shifts in 1—digit occupation do not explain the much larger hours variance

across jobs than within jobs.2° However, for the QES sample var(EHjt)

face value, this finding for the QES sample is consistent with the view that
the 17 job characteristics used to adjust hours are important labor supply
determinants and are responsible for the larger difference in variances

obtained for the unadjusted hours measures. In fact, after adjustment for

downward bias in the estimate of var(Lh1t) associated with degrees of
freedom which are lost in hours adjustment process and the small sample size

of the QES, there is little evidence that adjusting hours for the observed job
characteristics in the QES reduces the difference in variances within and
across jobs.21
The last three columns of Table 2 report results in which the hours

changes incorporate adjustments for hours of unemployment. This adjustment

makes little difference for hours/week. However, for weeks/year var(Hjt) —

var(tHjjt)

is reduced from .14 to .035 when k=1. The reduction is much

smaller for k=3 and k=5. The larger impact when k=1 reflects the fact that

occurrence of unemployment is often associated with a job shift, and for this
time interval the separation might have occurred during the year in which
Hjjt_i is measured, whereas for k=3 and k=5, the observations in which

separation occurs are removed from the sample. Thus, unemployment associated

with job separations should not directly influence Ht —

for Individual Heterogeneity in the Variance of Hours

In this section we provide estimates of var(hj) —

var(ht)

which

have been corrected for the likelihood that people who change jobs frequently

have more variable preferences for hours. There are a variety of reasons for
believing that this might be the case. The possibility is particularly
worrisome in light of Abowd and CardTh (1985b) results for both the PSID and
the National Longitudinal Survey indicating that the variance of the change in
the log of annual hours is larger for those who have worked for more than one
employer during the years covered by these surveys than for those who have
worked for only one employer, although Abowd and Card note that much of the
difference appears to be due to excess variance in the years surrounding a job
change (see their footnote 23).

Let var(hj) and var1(hit) denote the variance for person i of

individual specific (as opposed to job specific) because we are most

interested in checking whether consideration of heterogeneity of individual
specific labor supply preferences (eg., heterogeneity in the variance in

individual specific labor characteristics such as sft) can reconcile the large

We conclude that

heterogeneity

bias is not responsible for the earlier finding that the

variance of the hours change is significantly larger when the job changes than
when it does not.

Evaluating the Labor Demand—Perfect Mobility Model: The Distinction Between
Quits and Layoffs
To provide evidence on the Labor Demand—Perfect Mobility model (LD—PM) of

hours discussed in Section 2, we have computed var(H'1t) separately for job
changes resulting from quits and for job changes resulting from layoffs.

(Layoffs are about 40 % of job changes for our PSID sample of males.) These

results are in Table 4. The values of var(H1) for the two subgroups are
very similar for hours/week and are considerably in excess of the

var(H1t). For weeks/year, var(LH1) is considerably larger for the layoff
sample than for the quit sample, (.275 versus .072 when k=3), and a similar

finding is obtained for annual hours. For these dimensions of hours, the

difference between var(H't) for layoffs and quits is reduced considerably
when hours are adjusted for unemployment, and is reduced even further if one
restricts the sample to individuals who were employed at the survey date prior

to the calendar year in which hours are measured. However, it remains
positive. As was explained in Section 2, the fact that the variance in hours
are if anything larger for job changes arising from layoffs rather than quits
is strong evidence against the view that the large values for

var(tiHt) and var(Vit)—var(h1jt) may be explained with the LD—PM
model. 23

Alternative Measures of the Variability of Hours Within and Across Jobs

We use the variance as our principal measure of dispersion because
additivity of the variances of the sums of independent random variables

— 30 —

simplifies

the algebra of Section 2 and the Appendix and because the variance

is the most commonly used dispersion measure. However, we also report results
using the mean absolute change in the hours measures as the measure of
dispersion in Appendix Table A424. (Table A4 also presents results for

unmarried and married women.) This measure may be less sensitive to the
presence of a few outliers and perhaps provides a better feeling for the

typical change in hours. The mean absolute change in hours/week, weeks/year,
and annual hours are more than twice as large when the job changes as when it
does not.

Much work on labor supply has been conducted using actual hours rather
than the log of hours. For this reason, Table A.5 and Table A6 report

estimates of the variances and mean absolute values of the within and across

job changes in actual hours A.jjt and [ijt' where

denotes the actual

value of the various hours measures and is equal to exp(H1t). The changes
are computed over a three year interval. The results are basically consistent
with the results for the log values. The mean absolute value of the time
change in hours/week is about

hours larger when the job changes than when it

does not.25

As an alternative means of summarizing the data, we have performed an
analysis of the autocorrelations over time of the levels (as opposed to first
differences) of the actual (non log) hours measure

(Results not

reported.) We find that the correlation of jt with its value for person

i

in t—k is much smaller when the job has changed than when it has not. For

example, using hours/week and k=3, the correlation is .23 when the person
has changed jobs between t and t—3 and .57 when the person has kept the same
job.

— 31 —

4.2

Results for Married and Unmarried Women

Table 5 compares var(Hjt) with var(EHt) and var(hjt) with
var(ht) for a sample of unmarried women. The variance estimates for
unmarried women indicate that hours are heavily influenced by job specific

characteristics. For changes in hours/week when k=3, var(Hjt) is .1780

while var(H) is only .0458. The results for k=3 and k=5 suggest that
changes in all three hours measures are between 4 and 5 times more variable
across jobs than within jobs and this finding holds for actual values of the

hours variables as well as logs. (See Table A5.) Adjustment for observed
characteristics of jobs makes little qualitative difference in the results.
We conclude that the results for unmarried women are qualitatively consistent
with those for men.26
For married women, data on the occurrence of job changes was collected

only in the 1976, 1979—1981 surveys. Consequently, we report results only for
1 year changes (k=1) for this group, since it is not possible to construct 3

year and 5 year changes using the method discussed in Section 3. The results

in Table 5 show that var(Hjjt) exceeds var(Ht) by a large margin, although
the difference for married women is smaller in percentage terms than it is for

unmarried women or for men. This conclusion holds for the adjusted hours
change measures as well.27 Comparison of columns 1 and 2, rows 1—3 and 13—16

indicates that var(MIj) is similar for married and unmarried women but that
hours on the same job are more variable for married women. This is consistent
with the notion that hours preferences of married women are more variable than
those of unmarried women (and men), and that married women tend to select jobs

which provide more flexible hours. However, the data on hours for 1979—1981
for married women are more likely to be supplied by another household member

than are the data for heads of household. Consequently, measurement error

— 32 —

may

be more serious for married women than for the other two groups, and thus

measurement error might contribute more to the hours variances for married
women.

5. Discussion and

Conclusion

In this paper we have provided evidence indicating that work hours of
individuals are heavily influenced by the characteristics of specific jobs.
The empirical work is based upon the following simple idea. To the extent
that workers may freely choose hours and hours changes are influenced by
shifts over time in individual preferences and resources,

the variance in the

time change of hours should not depend upon whether or not the particular job
to which the individual worker supplies labor has changed. The desire to
reduce or increase hours could be acted upon within the current job.
-

other

On the

hand, suppose the factors which influence hours worked when a person is

in a given job are largely specific to that job. In this case, hours changes
should be larger when persons switch jobs than when they

do not. We find that

hours are changes in hours are 2 to 4 times as variable across jobs than

within jobs. Our analysis of quits and layoffs indicates that this result is
not consistent with the view that workers are able to easily avoid demand
constraints by changing jobs whenever they wish to adjust hours, although the
desire to adjust work hours might be an important factor in job mobility.
Individuals who change jobs as a result of a layoff experience hours changes

which are even larger than those who initiate a quit. They do not simply find
a new job which offers an hours level similar to the level of their previous

job. We conclude that the characteristics of the specific job held have a
large influence on the hours worked by individuals at a given point in time.

We have emphasized that there are at least two structural interpretations

— 33 —

of

these results. One interpretation, which we refer to as LD—IM, is that the

freedom of workers to vary hours per week and weeks per year is sharply

restricted within a given job. Under this interpretation, hours levels are
heavily influenced by firm preferences arising from a variety of factors

mentioned in the introduction to the paper. Upon joining the labor force,
workers seek jobs which match their labor supply preferences. Much of the
variance of hours over time occurs as workers change jobs to seek hours levels
which are more in accord with the amount which they currently wish to work, or
move to jobs which require less desirable hours but offer an overall job

package which is superior to their current one. The second interpretation,
model LS—JC, is that many non—wage labor supply determinants are job specific

and vary greatly across jobs. Given the absence of data on many of the
variables which might influence labor supply to a specific job and errors in
the measures which are available, the fact that our results for the adjusted

and unadjusted hours measures are similar is not very compelling evidence

against a labor supply —3ob cvv'

2-,Xf1I(o,J

In any case, the finding that job characteristics are a key influence on
work hours has important implications for research on structural models of

work hours. First, it suggests that research within a labor supply framework
should place much greater emphasis on job—related hours determinants other
than the wage rate.

Second, the research mentioned in the introduction on aspects of the role

of employer preferences in hours of work should be expanded. With data on a
cross section of jobs and multiple observations on workers in each type of
job, one could attempt to estimate a structural model of hours determination
along the lines of Section 2 (see Appendix 1 for more details) as well as
study the determinants of the relative weights on the preferences of workers

— 34

and firms in hours determination.
Finally, the results suggest that job specific labor supply determinants
and/or hours requirements vary sufficiently across jobs to warrant a key role

in studies of job mobility. Job characteristics which have a large effect on
the number of hours workers wish to work or are required to work at a given
wage also presumably have a large effect on the desirability of various

jobs. Workers whose labor supply preferences change and who wish to reduce or
increase hours as a result may be forced to change jobs.28 The links between
labor supply preferences, hours constraints, and job mobility are an
interesting topic for future research.

MaCurdy (1981) and Killingsworth (1983).

See Lewis (1969), Rosen (1969), Barzel (1973) and Deardorff and
Stafford (1976). Among the early labor demand studies to emphasize employer
preferences between hours per worker and employment are Brechling (1965),
Ehrenberg (1971), Feldstein (1967) and Nadiri and Rosen (1969). There is, of
course, an extensive aggregate time series literature on the demand for
labor. See Hamermesh (1985) and Nickel (1985) for recent surveys.
Additional references may be found in these papers and in Killingsworth
(1983). Killingsworth (1983, pg. 42) provides references to studies which
have examined the implications of rationing of hours for overtime, shift work,
and multiple job holding. Ham (1979) and Moff it (1981) estimate models in
which workers may be constrained in how little they can work. Moffits
econometric model is very similar to those of Cogan (1981) and Hanoch (1980)
(see also Hausman (1980)) who stress labor supply factors as the source of
the minimum number of hours people choose to work. Blank (1985) discusses
these possibilities in an analysis (like HanochTh) which distinguishes among
hours per week and weeks per year. Dickens and Lundberg (1985) investigate a
labor supply model in which persons must select from a finite number of
employment opportunities. The jobs require different numbers of hours,
although each pays the same hourly wage. In Altonji and Paxson (1985) we
investigate the implications of underemployment and overemployment for the
pattern of wage changes and hours changes which occur when people change jobs.

See especially Rosens (1985) presentation of this literature. Abowd
and Card (1985) appears to be the first study to use micro data to examine
labor supply within an implicit contracts framework. Bernanke (1985) uses a
joint model of hours and earnings to study labor market behavior during the
Great Depression.
6 "Firm" and "job" are used synonymously in the paper. In the empirical
work, job changes correspond to employer changes. An analysis of changes in
position within a firm would be an interesting extention of the study.
In both models complications arise when workers are faced with a
nonlinear schedule relating the wage rate to hours of work rather than with a
parametric wage ———see Rosen (1976), Moffit (1983) and Lundberg (1984).

This may be relaxed by expressing
where the
function may depend upon firm characteristics, and replacing wj in (1) with

the derivative of earnings with respect to H.t. Ht would then be the
implicit solution to the modified equation. imilar modifications may be made
to other equations in the model.
10 As noted earlier, changes in expectations of future wages are part of

— 36

the vector of labor supply determinants Z11. and feature prominently
conventional lifecycle models of labor supply. One might expect the variance
of changes in these expectations (as well as the current wage) to be greater
when the job changes than when it does not to the extent that wages are job
specific. Controlling for occupation, union status, and the current wage
removes only part of this difference. Consequently, it is at least possible

that the large difference between var(Lht) and var(tht) is due to a
conventional labor supply response to a larger variance across jobs in the
change in expectations about lifetime wages. However, such an explanation is
implausible given the very large difference in variances which we find, the
evidence from a variety of studies that, at least for males, labor supply is
not very responsive to current and future wage changes, and the fact that
current wage changes explain virtually none of the variance of the hours
changes (See Table Al, columns 1, 4, and 7.)

"The separation indicator from the PSID required extensive recoding for
the years 1968—1973 since quits and promotions are not distinguished in these
years. For details on how the separation indicator was constructed, see
Altonji and Shakotko (1985, Appendix 2).
12When an individual reports a job change in the previous survey year, it
is difficult to determine whether the job change occurred prior to January, or
between January and the date of the survey. If the job change occurred prior
to January, then the hours measures for the previous calendar year reflect
hours worked on more than one job; if the job change happened after January,
then the hours measures for the current calendar year have this problem.
Since data on tenure with employer are usually not precise enough to determine
exactly when the separation occurred, hours change measures which are based on
the current and the previous calendar year are suspect when a separation is
indicated.
13 See Table Al and Table A2 for a list.

14 The observations corresponding to job changes and the observations
corresponding to no job change were weighted (respectively) by estimates of
the inverse of the standard deviation of Ujjt ijt when the job has changed
and when the job has not changed. This corrects for heteroscedasticity
associated with the fact e variance of the error component of (8) depends on
whether or not the job changes. In practice, the weighted estimates of (8)
are very similar to unweighted estimates.

15 The same problem exists for the QES. Unfortunately, the QES does not
contain an alternative wage measure to use as an instrument. For the
is the change in the log of total annual earnings. See Altonji
QES, w,
(1986) r a detailed discussion of the two PSID wage measures and the
problems which may arise in using them to estimate an intertemporal labor
supply model. For the PSID, the estimate of (8) is based on a subsample of
observations, since the change in the log of the reported hourly wage is
missing for all workers prior to 1970 and for salaried workers prior to

1976. The parameter estimates are used to compute Ah1 and ih1t for each
observation in accordance with equation(9a, 9b) below, regardless of whether

that observation was used to calculate a2, a, a4, and a.

— 37

16 The R2Th for equations with hours/week as the dependent variable are
very low. The R2 statistic is much higher for the change in weeks/year and
annual work hours, although most of the explanatory power is due to the
inclusion of the change in hours of unemployment. The parameter estimates may
be of some interest to researchers working on intertemporal labor supply
models. The two stage least squares procedure used to estimate columns 1—6 is
very similar to one of the procedures in Altonji (1986), although the PSID
subsample used in the latter study was restricted to workers who were paid by
the hour and who were continuously married to the same wife from 1968 to 1979,
and included only limited data from 1980 and 1981. Also, Altonji (1986) does
not distinguish between hours changes with and without job changes, analyzes
only annual hours/year, does not include interactions among the job change and
wage change, and incudes fewer control variables for annual hours. We find
that the wage response is about evenly divided between hours per week and
weeks per year, although this is less true of the analysis at 3 year
intervals. We also find that the response of annual hours to Wjj is .1271
with a t—value of 2.52 for those who do not change jobs. However, this
response is reduced by —.2023 to —.0752 when a separation occurs. From the
standpoint of the life—cycle labor supply framework, the more negative
coefficient on the wage when a job change occurs is consistent with the view
that wage changes associated with job changes are more permanent and less
easily anticipated than those on a continuing job. However, an alternative
explanation is that there exists a negative association across jobs between
wage rates and the quality of the work environment. It is also worth noting
that the separation dummy has only a small effect on expected value of the
hours change measures. For the QES sample, the coefficient on earnings of
.1699 translates into a wage response of .2047 (.205 = .1699/(1—.1699)). This
estimate is within the range of estimates of the intertemporal labor supply
elasticity for men reported in earlier studies. It is biased downward by
measurement error in earnings and biased upward (toward 1) by the fact that
earnings are endogenous in the hours equation. Overall, the point estimates
are basically consistent with estimates from previous studies summarized in
Ashenfelter (1984), Killingsworth (1983, Ch. 5.4), and Pencavel (1984). Of
course, these results and those of the other other studies do not have a clear
interpretation if employer preferences have strong influence on hours, or if
job mobility is affected by labor supply preferences and hours constraints.
17The effect of additive measurement errors in the log of hours and the
log of earnings on the variances of the adjusted hours chages within and

let w
be the true value for the log of hourly earnings. Let e1 be an

measurement in the log of earnings which is independent of Ejjt. The
fact that the observed value of wj1 is equal to the log of total annual
earnings minus the log of observed annual hours implies that observed hours
and wages will have the following relationship to true hours and wages:

Let h*i.t and h*jt denote true adjusted hours changes within and across

Note that the effects of the measurement error terms in the above equation are

if

a2 is 0.

18 The reported standard errors are based on the assumptions that the
observations on the change in hours within and across jobs are independent (1)
across individuals and (2) over time for a given person. The correlation of
the change in hours across individuals in the same year is in fact trivial and
may be safely ignored. Correlation over time for a given individual is likely
to bias the standard errors downward by a small amount.

19 We computed the variance of hours within and across jobs for k=3 and
k=5, but without setting hours to missing in years in which a separation may
have occurred. This resulted in variance estimates closer to those obtained
for k=1. For example, when k=3 and no separation checks are performed,
is .0446. When separation
var(Ht) is .0393, and var(LHj) —

var(EHijt)

checks are performed var(Hit) is .0360 and var(tH.) — var(Hi.t) is
.0704. Thus when hours measures reflect hours worked in differen jobs,
var(Ht) is understated.
20 We experimented with the use of 2—digit occupation dummies and
obtained results which are very similar to those reported in the table.

21 Most of the variability in the 9 one digit occupation measures and the
17 various job characteristics comes from observations across jobs, and there
are only 67 observations on job changers. In this situation the "R2" for
observations in which a separation occurs is likely to be substantial even
under the null hypothesis that none of the job specific variables have any
influence on hour choice. In fact, none of the variables are individually
statistically significant, and the joint hypothesis that the coefficients on
all of them are 0 easily passes an F—test. To obtain a rough idea of bias
from loss of the degrees of freedom in adjusting H1t for changes in job
characteristics, we experimented with using (67 — 17 — 9 —1) rather than (67—

which actually exceeds the estimate based upon unadjusted hours. Although
this adjustment is crude the evidence indicates that observed job
characteristics in the QES do not explain the larger variance in hours/week
across jobs than within jobs.

var(h1t)

22 For a number of reasons, var(d) might be associated with the
frequency with which a person changes jobs. For example, layoffs might be

— 39

preceded by an hours reduction. Consequently, a comparison of var(h1.t) and
var(h1t) with individual differences accounted for may provide a beter
indication of var(hjt) —
for a given worker.

23 In Section 2 we did not mention the possibility that large values of
and var(ih1t) — var(h1.t) could be reconciled with
LS—PC i for some reaon the variance of individuai specific labor supply
determinants depends upon the factors which cause job changes. For example,
the occurrence of a divorce may be associated with a geographical move and
consequently a job change, as well as large changes in the amount people wish
to work. However, we would expect these considerations to be more of a factor
for quits than for firm—initiated separations, in which case the evidence in
the text suggests that they are not of primary importance. 1e are grateful to
Rebecca Blank for helpful discussions on this issue.

var(H.t) —

var(H1.)

24 Systematic differences in the hour changes when job changes do and do
not occur are accounted for by subtracting the mean algebraic change in

and H1t from

and Hjjt prior to calculation of the absolute
values. In practice, this adjustment makes little difference in the results.
25 Although our focus is on hours in the main job, we also examined the

relationship between changes in hours on the main job and changes in hours on
other jobs for our sample of men. We found (1) that the changes in annual
hours on the main job have a negative covariance with changes in hours on
other jobs and (2) the absolute value of this negative covariance rises
proportionately with the higher variance in the hours change on the main job
when the main job has changed. We suspect that these results are consistent
with both LD—IM and LS—JC. If hours changes over time are determined largely
by variation in personal characteristics, we would expect changes in hours on
the main job and on extra jobs to be positively correlated. Use of total work
hours rather than annual hours on the main job does not have much effect on
the results for annual hours in Table 2.

27 For married women, adjustment of the hours measures sharply increases
the variance in the change in hours when a separation occurs relative to the
variance when the job remains the same. (Compare columns 3, 6, and 9 in rows
13—15.) This is true regardless of whether the hours change measures are
adjusted for unemployment. We investigated the reason for the large affect of
the adjustment and found that it is related to measurement error in the hours
and earnings data in conjunction with the fact that for married women the
point estimates of the response of hours to a change in the wage differ
sharply depending upon whether or not a job change has occurred. As shown in
footnote 17, these two types of measurement error bias the estimates of

yar(h jt) and var(ht) upward, and the size of the bias is increasing in
a2 and a2. To take the most extreme example, the parameter estimates in
Table A3 indicate that the response of hours/week to the wage is —.492 when a
job change does not occur (az) and 2.14 when a job change does occur (a2 +

measurement error is important. Footnote 17 also shows that var(ht) —

— 40

var(ht) may be biased up or down, depending on the values of a2 and a2 and
the importance of measurement error in hours and measurement error in
earnings. In the case of married women, the sign of the bias is positive. To
get a handle on these issues empirically, we computed alternative measures of
var(h.t) and var(tht) after using the reported hourly wage rather than
average iourly earnings to adjust annual hours for the wage change. In this
case,

var(ht) and var(tht) —

28 Gustman and SteinmeierTh (1983, 1984) studies of partial retirement by
older workers suggests that this is the case. Kiefer (1984) and Altonji and
Paxson (1985) examine the empirical implications of the possibility that given
imperfect information workers must tradeoff hours adjustments and wage gains
in searching for better jobs. In Altonji and Paxson (1986, in progress) we
are investigating whether changes in labor supply preferences induce quits
from one firm to another and the extent to which changes in labor supply
preferences are reflected in hours changes only if people change employers.

A Model of Hours Determination

In this Appendix we present a prototype model of hours determination
which combines aspects of three models which have been presented in previous
studies: a lifecycle labor supply model, a model of the firn(s preferences for

hours, and an implicit contracts model. The model provides a concrete example
of the framework sketched in Section 2. With more development and a much
richer data set, perhaps it could serve as the basis for a structural analysis

of hours incorporating the preferences of workers and firm. We also derive
complete expressions for the variance in hours changes within jobs and across
jobs in terms of the parameters of the model.

Al. The Labor Supply Model
Assume that preferences for consumption and leisure are separable within

periods and over time. (Heckman and MaCurdy (1980), Browning et al (1985),
MaCurdy (1981, 1983) and the surveys by Killingsworth (1983) and Pencavel
(1984) provide detailed discussions of life cycle labor supply models.)

A2. The Labor Demand Model
Following the approach taken in the studies cited in fn. 2, assume that

output (Qj) in firm

at time t is a function of the number of workers

employed (N) and the actual (non—log) number of hours per worker (ijt)•

A3. The Implicit Contracts Model
The efficient contract hours level is determined by equating the marginal

product of labor with the marginal utility of leisure. Let Hjt be the log of
the efficient contract hours level, and 9ijt be the log of marginal product of

labor. Since (A.6) relates the marginal product of labor to the wage rate,

How are hours actually determined? A simple rule which nests various

Discussions of the feasibility of efficient contracts such as Grossman
(1977), Brown (1982), and Rosen (1985) suggest that the degree to which md and

— 44

differ from 0 will depend upon the existence of shared rents, and
reputation effects which provide both parties with the incentive to honor the
contract, as well as the degree to which information about the value of

marginal utility of labor and the marginal product of labor is available to

both the firm and the worker. Suppose that contracts are not fully efficient
and both firms and workers use the wage rate as the shadow price of labor in

making their supply and demand offers. Unless the firm is indifferent with
respect to the choice of hours over the range of variation in the workers
prefernces, changes in the preferences of a given worker and variation in
s

d

preferences across workers will cause II•• and H..t to diverge. Presumably,
the relative values of m5 and md reflect the flexibility of worker and firm
preferences over hours, as indexed by the wage parameters b and B of the
supply and demand functions, just as the weights on firm and worker
preferences in the efficient contract level of hours reflect these

parameters. If technology is such that the marginal product of labor is
highly nonlinear with respect to

in the neighborhood of Hjt then

presumably the job is characterized by a value of m5 which is small relative
to mci. Firms and workers may differ in the variability of their hours

preferences as well as in the flexibility of the preferences. The expected
level of compensation across jobs may vary with m5 and mci, the variability in

non—wage determinants of H.t , as well as with the average level
of

(across time periods) give a particular wage. Presumably, workers

sort themselves across firms to some extent so that inflexible (flexible)
workers tend to be matched with flexible (inflexible) employers.

A5. Derivation of the Change in Hours
Both the change in hours wihtin jobs and across jobs will contain a term
involving the response of ln

For the general case in which the preferences of both worker i and firm j are
weighted in hours determination the difference in variances (A.15) involves a large

number of terms. The expression simplifies greatly if hours are determined entirely
by the worker or entirely by the firm. It would be very difficult to identify
richer structural models from the variances and autocovariances of the hours changes
within and across jobs without detailed data on some of the determinants of firm and

worker preferences. A prototype for such an analysis (using earnings and hours) is
Abowd and Card (1985b).

The procedure used to adjust the hours measures for the effects of job specific variables is discussed in Section 3.2. For the
P510 the job specific characteristics are changes in dummies for I digit occupation and union
Status, and the change in the wage as
well as (for columns 7—9) the change in annual hours of unemployment. For the OES the job
specific characteristics are changes In
dummies for I digit occupation and union membership, the change in the log of annual
earnings, and the changes in 17 varIables
related to job characteristics. The 17 variables include dummies for whether the job is dangerous, whether It
provides daycare,
whether the work is interesting, whether the physical conditions are good, in the individual learns a lot on the
job, whether a
training program Is available, whether the worker Is free to decide how to do tasks, whether promotion chances are good, whether
job
security Is good, whether the work is steady, whether fringe benefits are good, whether the job gives paid vacation
days and sick
pay, whether the job requires hard work, and whether travel is convenient; also included are the change in average travel
time, and
the change in number of peqple working at the firm. The coefficients used to
perform the adjustment are reported In Table A.l
