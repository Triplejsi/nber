The “Greatest” Carry Trade Ever? Understanding Eurozone Bank Risks
Viral V. Acharya and Sascha Steffen
NBER Working Paper No. 19039
May 2013
JEL No. F3,G01,G14,G15,G21,G28
ABSTRACT
We show that Eurozone bank risks during 2007-2012 can be understood as a “carry trade” behavior.
Bank equity returns load positively on peripheral (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy, or GIPSI)
bond returns and negatively on German government bond returns, a position that generated “carry”
until the deteriorating GIPSI bond returns inflicted losses on banks. The positive GIPSI loadings correlate
with banks’ holdings of GIPSI bonds; and, the negative German loading with banks’ short-term debt
exposures. Consistent with moral hazard in the form of risk-taking by large, under-capitalized banks
to exploit government guarantees, arbitrage regulatory risk weights, and access central-bank funding,
we find that this carry-trade behavior is stronger for large banks, and banks with low Tier 1 ratios and
high risk-weighted assets, in both GIPSI and non-GIPSI countries’ banks, but not so for similar banks
in other Western economies or for non-bank firms.

“And of course, the deterioration of the Euro zone situation and particularly the sovereign crisis
in the peripheral economies hit very badly the group. And that’s of course not a surprise for a
group that still had very important short-term funding needs that was mainly present in strong
exposures in peripheral countries. [...] Before 2008, it was the group’s high rating granting easy
access to wholesale funding that led to the situation of October 2008 with short-term funding
need of €260 billion outstanding in October 2008, i.e. 43% of total balance sheet. [...] with very
significant acceleration and buildup of the bond portfolio was amounting at €203 billion at the
end of 2008. Mostly carry trades with marginal improvement of customer access [...] that led to a
very significant gearing ratio because the portfolio size was, at that time, 25 times the group
equity.” - Pierre Mariani, Chairman of the Management Board and CEO, Dexia SA, Earnings
Call, February 23rd, 2012

1. Introduction
The ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has cast doubt on the solvency of European
banks that incurred substantial mark-to-market losses and impairments on their peripheral
(Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy, or GIPSI) sovereign bond holdings. Since mid-2008,
government bond yield spreads between pairs of European countries, for example, between
German bunds and GIPSI bonds, have widened considerably, mirroring the economic divergence
between these countries (Figure 1).1 This divergence has challenged even the survival of the
Eurozone as a whole. Since then, banks have on average lost 70% of their market value and shed
billions of euros of assets in an effort to increase regulatory capital ratios.
[Figure 1]
We show in this paper that banks’ risks during this period can be understood as
reflecting a “carry trade” behavior. With access to short-term unsecured funding in wholesale
markets, banks appear to have undertaken long peripheral sovereign bond positions. On the
upside, the trade would pocket the “carry”, the spread between the long-term peripheral sovereign
bonds and banks’ short-term funding costs. On the downside, which has materialized, the spreads
between two legs of the trade diverged even further resulting in significant losses for banks and

percent benchmark with a small yield spread difference between core and peripheral European countries.

leading to questions in funding markets about their solvency and liquidity. In essence, this carry
trade reflects a bet that Eurozone countries would converge economically resulting in a
convergence of the spread between its two legs.
Dexia SA (Dexia), a Belgian financial group and one of the largest lenders to public
sector entities, provides a quintessential example of such behavior as it invested heavily in these
carry trades (see the introductory quote). Dexia built up a risky bond portfolio of almost a third of
the bank’s total balance sheet which was financed almost 50% with short-term funding. As the
quality of the bond portfolio worsened, Dexia was unable to roll over the financing of its assets
and was bailed out in October 2011. Dexia is not an isolated case. Bank of Cyprus more than
quadrupled its investments in Greek government bonds in 2010 as Greek bonds were among the
highest yielding sovereign bonds and financed its investment with short-term funds obtained
from the ECB in 2009.
We document that this behavior has in fact been pervasive among Eurozone banks. We
investigate the causes of the European banking crisis and argue that banks’ substantial share price
decline can in part be explained by banks placing a bet on the survival of the Eurozone, choosing
to hold peripheral sovereign bonds and financing their investments in short-term wholesale
markets. While correlations between bond yields of Germany (or France) and peripheral
sovereign bond yields were above 95% in 2005, these correlations became negative in 2010 when
markets became more reluctant to finance banks’ investments in risky sovereign debt resulting in
a flight into longer-term core European (particularly German) government bonds. In other words,
the banks lost on both sides of the carry trade.
At the core of our analysis are the publicly listed banks that took part in five consecutive
stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) starting in 2010 and ending in
June 2012. March 2010 is the first reporting date as of which detailed information about
2

European banks’ sovereign bond holdings is available. We document interesting patterns in the
sovereign bond holdings of banks.
First, our data show that European banks already entered the stress test period with a
substantial exposure to GIPSI sovereign debt which overall remains remarkably constant over the
next two years.
Second, and more importantly, GIPSI and non-GIPSI banks appear to have actively
managed their sovereign bond portfolios by increasing their sovereign bond exposures to Italy,
Spain and Portugal even as yield spreads on these countries’ debt widened between March and
December 2010.2 This behavior rules out the alternative that banks were passively caught in the
sovereign debt crisis due to exposures to peripheral sovereign debt prior to the emergence of Irish
and Greek sovereign crises in 2009.
Third, banks with lower Tier 1 ratios, higher risk-weighted assets and larger loan-to-asset
ratios increased their holdings particularly in Spanish sovereign bonds between March and
December 2010 strongly supporting regulatory arbitrage as important motivation for bank
behavior.3
Fourth, this active trading behavior reversed (only as late as) between January 2012 and
June 2012, when domestic (Italian and Spanish) banks substantially increased their exposure to
their domestic sovereign, while non-domestic banks even decreased their holdings. The European
Central Bank (ECB) injected about EUR 1 trillion with a maturity of three years and a 0.75%
coupon into the banking system in two three-year Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs)
in December 2011 and February 2012 facilitating these trades. We document that Italian banks
purchased domestic sovereign bonds for EUR 28.6 billion with a maturity of equal or below three
2

S&P downgraded Spanish bonds to AA from AA+ in April 2010 pushing yield spreads for ten-year sovereign
bonds higher than (worse rated) Italian bonds.

Interestingly, non-domestic banks increased their exposure more relative to domestic banks. For example, nonSpanish banks increased their Spanish sovereign bond positions by 66% between March 2010 and December 2010.

3

years which is consistent with a match of the maturities of the securities they purchase with the
maturity of the ECB funds. Spanish banks also increased their exposures to Spanish government,
albeit in smaller magnitudes. Non-Italian and non-Spanish banks reduced their exposures.
Overall, the descriptive evidence based on reported sovereign bond holdings imply an
overall increase in risk exposure towards peripheral sovereign debt for both GIPSI and nonGIPSI banks during March 2010 and December 2010, and a shift in this risk exposure from nonGIPSI banks into GIPSI banks’ portfolios between January 2012 and June 2012.
Micro level data of sovereign bond positions (except for the five EBA reporting dates) are
unavailable to us on a high-frequency basis. Furthermore, banks may be exposed to sovereign
bond risk other than through direct bond positions, e.g., through credit default swap positions and
counterparty exposure in derivatives transactions with governments. Given this limitation and to
link bank risk to both the investment and funding leg of the carry trade, we collect daily stock
prices for these banks as well as daily ten-year sovereign bond yields over the January 2007 to
June 2012 period. Our main results are as follows:
First, we find a positive correlation between banks’ stock returns and GIPSI bond returns
and a negative correlation with German bund returns and these correlations are significantly
larger during the 2007 – 2012 period as compared to the pre-2007 period. European banks are
thus effectively, on average, long GIPSI government bonds and their stock returns decline when
bond prices depreciate. The negative loadings on German government bonds (bunds) suggest that
banks are “short” long-term German bunds. In other words, these results suggest that banks were
financing long-term peripheral bonds with short-term debt in a carry trade.4

4

If long-term German bund prices appreciate whenever short-term funding dries up (due to a flight to safety or
quality) and banks are exposed to short-term funding, then it would appear as if banks were “short” long-term
German bunds.

4

Second, we show that the peripheral exposures relate to banks’ actual government bond
holdings rather than non-sovereign exposures (to firms, households and real estate). Moreover,
banks with more short-term funding exposure (through US money market funds (MMF)5 and
other wholesale funding sources) have more negative factor loadings on German bunds.
Third, we provide a large number of falsification tests suggesting that the return exposures
consistent with a carry trade behavior were specific to banks and not to hedge funds or industrial
firms, and specific to Eurozone banks and not to banks of other Western economies. This is
potentially due to the funding “put” from domestic central banks and European Central Bank
against Eurozone sovereign collateral, available only to Eurozone banks.
We then explore incentives for banks to engage in carry trades, namely: (1) implicit
bailout guarantees, (2) risk shifting by under-capitalized banks, (3) regulatory capital arbitrage,
and (4) European Central Bank (ECB) funding, which might have all – individually or in
conjunction – made these trades more attractive for banks.
We find that larger banks are significantly more exposed consistent with large banks
exploiting an implicit bailout guarantee from their sovereign. Also, banks with greater leverage,
and in particular, a higher percentage of short-term leverage relative to total debt, have somewhat
higher exposure to GIPSI countries and lose significantly greater market value when German
bond prices appreciate.
The regulatory capital arbitrage motive arises under the current Basel II regulations
which assign a zero risk weight for investments in sovereign debt. The governments may

5

The dependence on US money market funds (MMF) by European banks for US-Dollar funding potentially poses a
threat to their (short-term) liquidity and could be transmitted to other financial institutions or the real economy
(Chernenko and Sunderam, 2012, and Ivashina, Scharfstein and Stein, 2012).

5

themselves have had incentives to preserve the zero risk weight to be able to continue to borrow.6
Undercapitalized banks, that is, banks with low Tier 1 capital ratios, now have an incentive to
increase short-term return on equity by shifting their portfolios into highest-yielding assets with
lowest risk weights in an attempt to meet the regulatory capital requirements without having to
issue economic capital (regulatory capital arbitrage).7
Moreover, riskier banks might shift into riskier government bonds placing a bet on their
own survival (risk shifting) as this way they shift risk into the states of the world (government
defaults) where they are likely to experience bank runs (as argued by Diamond and Rajan, 2011).
While the regulatory arbitrage incentive would be stronger both for GIPSI and non-GIPSI banks,
the second incentive would be stronger for domestic banks of GIPSI countries. We focus in our
analysis of these incentives on Italy and Spain as largest bond markets among the GIPSI
countries and find that banks with lower core Tier 1 ratios or higher risk-weighted assets have
greater exposure to GIPSI bonds. This is reflected in both higher sensitivities of banks’ equity to
GIPSI bond returns as well as higher (reported) bond holdings by riskier and weakly capitalized
banks, for banks of both GIPSI and non-GIPSI countries, lending support to the presence of
regulatory arbitrage incentives.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3
presents Dexia as the quintessential example of carry trade behavior, explains the data sources
and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 4 provides portfolio level evidence on sovereign
bond exposures. Section 5 presents our carry trade exposure estimates from multifactor models
and various robustness tests to demonstrate their validity. In Section 6, we relate our carry trade

The more entangled the financial sector with the governments, the more costly the government default would be
due to “collateral damage” in the form of bank runs and disruption of inter-bank and repo markets (Broner, Martin
and Ventura, 2010; Bolton and Jeanne, 2011 and Acharya and Rajan, 2011).

arising from earning returns on capital subject to a risk-weight based capital requirement scheme.

concludes with policy implications.
2. Related Literature
Our paper is related to the literature investigating the yield-chasing investment behavior
of financial institutions. Becker and Ivashina (2012) analyze the investment behavior of insurance
firms and document a reaching for yield behavior due to agency frictions. Kacperczyk and
Schnabl (2013) analyze the investment behavior of US MMF and find that these funds invested in
riskier securities searching for yield as money inflow was responsive to fund yields. Fischer et al.
(2012) focus on the investment behavior of German Landesbanken and document a searching for
yield due to risk shifting incentives after the announcement that government guarantees will be
revoked. We show in our paper that yield chasing by European banks implies investing in high
yielding long-term government debt financed with low yielding short-term wholesale funds
which ultimately leaves the banks exposed to risky assets and high funding risk.
It is also related to the literature highlighting that regulatory arbitrage is an important
motive for banks’ investment and financing decisions. Acharya, Schnabl and Suarez (2011)
investigate the widespread use of conduits in the securitization process and find evidence
consistent with regulatory arbitrage: Most conduits were set up with capital reducing liquidity
guarantees, they were particularly initiated by weakly capitalized commercial banks, and risks
were not transferred to investors but losses were rather booked by the guarantee issuing
institutions.8 Boyson, Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2013) analyze the use of trust preferred securities
by US bank holding companies as part of their regulatory capital and also find evidence

8

Acharya and Richardson (2010) also emphasize the importance of regulatory capital relief in explaining the huge
increase in securitization schemes of banks.

consistent with a regulatory capital arbitrage motive.9

Acharya, Engle and Pierret (2013)

compare the results from macroprudential stress tests both in the US and Europe with stress tests
based on market data. They conclude that the reliance on regulatory risk weights in the original
stress tests is in part responsible for the undercapitalization of the banking sector creating
incentives for banks to invest in low risk-weight assets.
The paper relates more broadly to the literature on risk shifting incentives of firms (Jensen
and Meckling, 1976). Several theoretical studies emphasize banks’ incentives to shift into riskier
assets. Furlong and Keeley (1987, 1989), for example, show that banks increase asset risks if they
have higher leverage. Keeley (1990) shows that increased competition among banks induces risk
shifting because of lower charter values. Relatedly, Hellman, Murdock and Stiglitz (2000) argue
that banks have higher gambling incentives if they are poorly capitalized. The Japanese
experience from the 1990s provides supporting evidence. Undercapitalized Japanese banks
followed a policy of regulatory forbearance extending loans to troubled borrowers to avoid their
insolvency and subsequent capital write-downs (Peek and Rosengren, 2005; Hoshi and Kashyap,
2010). Particularly affiliated banks channeled funds to these firms instead of giving credit to high
quality firms betting that the banks were going to be bailed out by the government if the firms
eventually defaulted (Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap, 2008).
3. Background and Data
In this section, we provide brief examples of two European banks that heavily invested in
carry trades and eventually defaulted – Dexia S.A. and Bank of Cyprus. We then describe the
data used during the rest of this paper.
A. Carry Trades Gone Wrong - Dexia and Bank of Cyprus

9

The Collins amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act requires that any trust preferred securities issued after May 19th,
2010 do no longer count towards Tier 1 capital which effectively eliminates the regulatory capital arbitrage using
these instruments.

Dexia SA was formed in 1996 through a merger of Crédit Local (France) and Crédit
Communal (Belgium). In October 2011, the Dexia Group was bailed out for a second time
because of carry trades that went wrong (see the quote of Dexia’s current CEO at the start of the
paper). This section provides a brief overview how the situation unraveled.
Dexia built a proprietary bond portfolio amounting to EUR 203 billion at the end of
2008 (about 32% of its balance sheet).10 These investments were carry-trades, financed in short
term wholesale markets. The bond exposure was mainly to fixed rate bonds and Dexia hedged the
interest rate risk using credit derivatives. Effectively, Dexia was short German bunds in the Total
Return Swap market betting on an increase in bund yields.
The sovereign debt crisis started in November 2009 when Greece forecasted an annual
budget deficit of 12.7% for 2009. During the following months, Greece, Portugal and Spain
announced first austerity measures to reduce their indebtness. Spain was downgraded by S&P
losing its AAA rating in April 2010 and Greece was downgraded below investment grade. In
May 2010, the Eurozone countries and the IMF agreed to the first EUR 110 billion bailout
package for Greece. On May 5th, the ECB announced that it had started to accept Greek
sovereign bonds as collateral independent of the rating responding to the tensions in funding
markets. The European Commission explicitly addressed its concerns with respect to the large
amount of sovereign debt in Dexia's portfolio and the use of interest rate derivatives which
"probably requires significant collateral for Dexia, which may reduce its eligible collateral base
for financing from the central banks or in the interbank repo market" (EC (2010)).11

10

Holding a large amount of securities given Dexia's funding imbalances was even encouraged by rating agencies:
"Dexia's widely diversified funding base and the liquidity reserve provided by its large securities portfolio offset its
reliance on wholesale capital markets." (S&P Ratings Direct, 22 May 2008).
11
Dexia held a portfolio of GIPSI sovereign bonds amounting to EUR 26.1 billion as of March 31st, 2010 consisting
mainly of Italian bonds (EUR 17.6 billion) and Greek government bonds (EUR 3.7 billion). The size of the sovereign
bond portfolio corresponds to almost three times of its book equity. Importantly, Dexia has kept the positions
unchanged since then.

9

Even though Dexia made considerable progress in reducing its dependence on shortterm wholesale funding and in reducing its overall balance sheet, it was poorly capitalized (given
the huge impairments due to the deleveraging process) in summer 201112, i.e. when the crisis
became worse, which contributed to the subsequent run on the bank. Moreover, both Moody's
and S&P placed Dexia's ratings under review for possible downgrade. As reported by the group,
EUR 22 billion in unsecured short-term funds have been withdrawn between April and June 2011
and their US Dollar position has been impacted first. Figure 2.A. shows that US Money Market
Mutual Funds (MMF) reduced their holdings of Dexia’s commercial papers and repos within a
few months in spring 2011 from about USD 10 billion to zero after rating agencies have put
Dexia on watchlist for possible downgrade.
[Figure 2]
Stock prices plunged following this liquidity shock. Consequently, Dexia needed to rely
increasingly on central bank funding which reduced the amount of available collateral for further
repo transactions.13 Figure 2.B. shows the pairwise correlation of Dexia’s stock return and Italian
sovereign bond returns and its stock return and German sovereign bond returns from January
2011 onwards. This graphic shows strikingly how the two legs of the carry trade diverged when
Italian yields surged and German bund yields continued to fall as investors continued their flight
into long-term German government bonds. Dexia lost about EUR 40 billion short-term funding
within 6 month in the second half of 2011. An additional EUR 6 billion unsecured short-term
funding was withdrawn during the July - September period, and another EUR 6 billion after
Moody's announcement of placing the group's long and short-term rating under review for

12

Dexia’s Tier 1 ratio fell to 7.56% at end of 2011 due to losses incurred while Dexia divested its assets.

and 2011.

possible downgrade on October 3rd, 2011. Moreover, the group lost commercial deposits of EUR
7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011.14
Dexia's derivative positions put even more pressure on short-term liquidity. Between
June and September 2011, Dexia had to post EUR 15 billion cash collateral due to the fall in
interest rates. On October 7th, Dexia incurred an additional EUR 16 billion margin call but was
unable to post the collateral and eventually was bailed out by the governments of Belgium,
France and Luxembourg. The government assured debtholders as well as swap counterparties that
they would not incur any losses in order not to trigger a default event. This is similar to
September 2008, when the US government bailed out American International Group (AIG). Also
in the case of Dexia, governments were concerned with massive losses that had to be booked by
the (unidentified) counterparties emphasizing the systemic importance of Dexia. It was bailed out
a third time in November 2012 and the European Commission extended an additional EUR 85
billion refinancing guarantee to restructure Dexia in December 2012.
Dexia is not an isolated example. The bailout of Cyprus to rescue its two failing banks
Bank of Cyprus (BOC) and Cyprus Popular Bank provides the most recent example how
aggressive yield chasing by banks in the form of investing in risky sovereign debt brings an entire
country at the verge of collapse. A recent investigation by the Cypriot central bank into the
activities of Bank of Cyprus (BOC) showed that BOC purchased about EUR 2 billion Greek
government bonds in 2010 increasing its holdings to about EUR 2.4 billion (A&S, 2013).15
Based on internal emails from BOC employees they infer the motives behind these
purchases. The existing non-performing loan portfolio eroded the profitability of the firm. BOC
thus purchased Greek government bonds to pursue an “absolute yield” strategy to deliver net

The 1-year CDS spread of the banking subsidiary Dexia Crédit Local. The CDS spread increased within a few
weeks after June 2011 from 200bps to 1,000bps reflecting its rise in short-term funding costs as well as the market
expectation of Dexia’s default probability over the next year.

interest income and "relative value" strategy to take advantage of selling opportunities to generate
gains around reporting dates (“window dressing”). They invested in amongst the highest yielding
bonds including longer maturity inflation linked bonds, which resulted in BOC ultimately
experiencing higher losses on account of the related hedging that was entered. Hedges were put
in place to swap longer dated bonds onto floating rates and maintain target durations.16
This carry trade was funded by the ECB. On December 16th, 2009, BOC applied and
received EUR 3 billion of ECB funding in a 1-year LTRO. The funds were not required to fund
the bank's existing balance sheet, but was obtained to invest in government and / or government
guaranteed bonds. Shortly thereafter, on Dec 21, 2009, BOC approved an increase in the overall
limit of the banks' bond portfolio to EUR 6 billion, which limits for investment in Greek and
Cypriot bonds set at 2 billion each. The yields on Greek and Cypriot were significantly higher
than interest rates on the ECB funds, and thus the ECB funding provided BOC with the
opportunity to increase net interest income.
B. Data Sources
To identify the effects of banks’ carry trade behavior, we construct a dataset using three
major data sources. We collect market information (bank stock prices, bank and sovereign CDS
spreads, and sovereign bond yields) from Bloomberg, information about bond portfolio holdings
from the European Banking Authority (EBA) and annual and quarterly reports from the banks,
and financial information from SNL Financial as well as company reports. We augment the data
with information from S&P Credit Portal, investor presentations and the European Central Bank
and Bank of International Settlement (BIS).

16

Total losses as a result of BOC’s Greek government bond holdings amounted to EUR 1.9 billion on 16 November
2012: EUR 910 million relate to the costs of restructuring due to the Private Sector Involvement program (PSI); EUR
562 million relate to mark to market adjustments on the new bonds; EUR 48 million relate to transfers from
Available for Sale (AFS) reserves; EUR 399 million relate to the costs of unwinding hedges related to the bonds.

12

We start with all public European banks included in the EBA stress tests. A list of these
banks is included in Appendix II.17 We collect financial information such as size, leverage and
capitalization from SNL Financial. In addition, we compute stock returns from daily stock prices.
We use ten-year benchmark government bond yields, which are observed on a daily basis. Stock
prices and bond yields are collected from Bloomberg.
Information about banks’ actual portfolio holdings of sovereign bonds is obtained from
the EBA. The EBA took over the responsibilities from the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors (CEBS) on January 1, 2011. They have been responsible for five stress tests and
capitalization exercises that have been conducted in the European banking market since 2010 to
“ensure the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets and the stability of the financial
system in the EU.”18 The results of the tests together with detailed information about banks
sovereign bond portfolios were published for the following reporting dates: (1) March 2010, (2)
December 2010, (3) September 2011, (4) December 2011 and (5) June 2012.19
We use the iMoneyNet database to collect monthly information about the holdings of
US Money Market Mutual Funds (US MMF) in European banks’ commercial paper and
repurchase agreements (repos). As a consequence of the financial crisis, the SEC approved
changes to Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 in 2010 and took other actions to
strengthen the regulatory framework that governs MMFs. Following SEC regulation, US MMFs
have to report monthly market-to-market net asset value per share (NAV) of their portfolios on

We exclude six banks from our analysis either because of data availability or because the bank is part of a banking
group where the parent owns the vast majority of stocks. These are: Bankia (BKIA), Raiffeisenbank International
AG (RBI), Österreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS), Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM), Hypo Real Estate
(HRX) and Irish Life and Permanent (IPM).

The first stress test was already performed in 2009, but neither the identity of the participating institutions nor
details about the results have been disclosed except for the information that all institutions were adequately

onwards.
C. Summary statistics
We provide descriptive statistics for the returns of GIPSI as well as German ten-year
government bonds in Table 1. Panel A of Table 1 shows the mean daily bond returns since
January 2007 in basis points (bps). Greek government bonds have the highest negative return as
well as the highest variance followed by Portugal and Ireland. All three countries have already
been bailed out by the European Union. Germany has positive daily returns with a small variance.
[Table 1]
Panel B (Panel C) reports bond return correlations between 2001 and 2007 (2007 and
2012). In the period between 2001 and 2007, bond returns were almost perfectly correlated. This
demonstrates that these countries were perceived by investors as being almost identical despite
the major economic differences between them. Greece and German government bond returns, for
example, had a correlation of 0.99. This changed significantly as the sovereign debt crisis
unfolded. Between 2007 and 2012, the bond return correlation among the GIPSI countries
declined and the correlation between GIPSI and German bond returns became negative showing
the divergence within the Eurozone and the flight to quality.20
Panel A of Appendix III lists the averages of key variables for each bank. Log-Assets is
the natural logarithm of total book assets. Loans / Assets is measured as total customer loans
divided by total assets. ST-LVG is short-term debt divided by total debt. RWA / Assets is riskweighted assets divided by book assets. Tier 1 is the Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted
assets. On average, 33% of the total debt is short-term debt and banks have a Tier 1 ratio of
20

We explore further time-series characteristics of GIPSI bond yields. The time-series are non-stationary but first
differenced time-series are. GIPSI bond yields are thus integrated of the order of 1 (I(1)). We test the co-integration
relationship between, for example, Italian government bond and German government bond yields and find that there
is no co-integrating relationship in the period starting in Q4 2009.

average five-year CDS spread is about 185 basis points.
4. How Did Banks Manage their GIPSI Exposure? Portfolio Level Evidence
In this section, we document the trading behavior of European banks and discuss
alternative explanations for our findings based on portfolio holding data obtained from the EBA.
Moreover we explore important differences as to the investments of peripheral versus core
European banks in peripheral sovereign debt, particularly how these patterns change once the
ECB started to fund the carry trades with two three-year LTROs in December 2011 and February
2012.
A. Sovereign bond holdings
The carry trade hypothesis suggests that banks exploited a widening of yield spreads
betting on their subsequent convergence while short-term funding was still available. The
incentives were particularly strong for weakly capitalized banks to shift their portfolios into
riskier assets and to improve their regulatory capital without the costs of raising fresh equity as
these exposures had zero capital requirements. However, there are alternative explanations for
these findings. For example, it could be that European banks did not increase their exposure to
GIPSI sovereign debt but they are they simply holding on to their pre-crisis holding, that is,
before the spreads widened (“inertia hypothesis”). European banks’ exposure to GIPSI countries
might also simply reflect a home-bias of banks holding domestic sovereign debt (“home bias
hypothesis”).
The EBA disclosed the sovereign bond holdings of European banks at five reporting
dates during the March 2010 to June 2012 period which provides first evidence that helps to
analyze banks’ behavior as to investments in risky sovereign debt and to disentangle the different
15

hypotheses. Table 2 shows a highly aggregated statistic of European banks’ sovereign bond
holdings at five reporting dates since March 2010 both for the full sample (Panel A) and
separately for GIPSI and non-GIPSI banks (Panel B).
[Table 2]
We document four important findings: First, European banks entered the sovereign debt
crisis with a substantial exposure to peripheral sovereign debt and their total exposure towards
Italian, Spanish and Portuguese government debt did not decrease substantially during the March
2010 to June 2012 period. For example, Italian government bond positions decreased only from
EUR 264.5 billion to EUR 258.9 billion. Second, we observe an increase in GIPSI and nonGIPSI banks’ exposure to Spanish, Italian and to some extent also Portuguese sovereign debt
between March and December 2010 when yield spreads widened (compare Figure 1). Non-GIPSI
banks even increased their exposure to Spanish sovereign debt more than GIPSI banks in
absolute euro amounts. Spanish bond yields surged above Italian bond yields after Spain was
downgraded by S&P in April 2010 despite a higher rating of Spain vis-à-vis Italy. In other words,
banks were not passively caught by the emergence of the sovereign debt crisis as suggested by
the inertia hypothesis, but actively increased risky sovereign debt positions in their portfolios.
This also rules out the alternative home bias hypothesis that our results are driven by peripheral
banks’ exposure to their home country. Particularly non-GIPSI banks were increasing their
exposure to peripheral sovereign debt during this period.21
Third, we observe a further substantial exposure increase to GIPSI sovereign debt in the
portfolios of GIPSI banks between December 2011 and June 2012. For example, Italian banks
invested about EUR 37 billion in domestic sovereign debt; Spanish banks increased their
exposure to Spanish government debt by about EUR 13 billion. Non-GIPSI banks, on the other
21

Our introductory example “Bank of Cyprus” demonstrates this active yield searching behavior in Greek
government bonds in 2010.

16

hand, kept their exposures largely unchanged during this period.22 In December 2011 and
February 2012, the ECB injected about EUR 1 trillion of liquidity into the banking system at a
coupon of 0.75% and with a maturity of three years. Fourth, due to a substantial reduction of
GIPSI sovereign debt in non-GIPSI portfolios in 2011 and a relatively larger increase of
exposures in non-GIPSI bank portfolios (particularly during December 2011 and June 2012), we
observe a shift in risk exposure towards peripheral sovereign debt from non-GIPSI banks into
GIPSI banks’ portfolios. Nonetheless, non-GIPSI banks keep a substantial exposure to peripheral
sovereign debt and our findings suggest that banks were actively purchasing these securities after
yield spreads widened in search for returns.
B. Increasing sovereign exposures: Moral hazard vs. home bias
In this sub-section, we investigate more generally European banks’ incentives to
purchase GIPSI sovereign debt after emergence of the sovereign crisis end of 2009 and how bank
behavior has changed between March 2010 and June 2012. To do this, we analyze the change in
banks’ sovereign bond holdings (1) by domestic vs. non-domestic bank, (2) by bank risk and (3)
by bond maturity. The results are reported in Table 3.
[Table 3]
Panel A of Table 3 reports the absolute change in Italian and Spanish sovereign bond
holdings for domestic and non-domestic banks between March and December 2010, January to
December 2011 and January and June 2012 as well as the percentage change. Between March
and December 2010, non-domestic banks had a higher absolute as well as percentage increase in
both Italian and Spanish sovereign debt than domestic banks. For example, non-Spanish banks
increased their holdings by 66.34%. Between January and June 2012, non-domestic banks
reduced their portfolio exposures towards both countries, whereas domestic (and, in particular
22

Note that Greek banks did not participate in the stress tests or capitalization exercises since September 2011.

17

Italian) banks purchased a significant amount of the debt of their own sovereign. Particularly
non-domestic banks reduced their exposures between January and December 2011.
In Panel B of Table 3, we show the change in Italian and Spanish sovereign debt as a
percentage of total assets separately for various risk characteristics. High Tier 1, High
RWA/Assets and High Loans/Assets are indicator variables equal to 1 if the banks’ Tier 1 ratio
(RWA/Assets ratio, Loans/Assets ratio) is within the lower (upper) quartile of the distribution
among all sample banks. For example, banks with a Tier-1 ratio below 9.03% (the 25% quartile)
increase their Italian bond holdings, on average, by 0.49% of total assets between March and
December 2010. Overall, we find that banks with low Tier-1 ratios, high RWA / Assets and high
Loans / Asset ratios, that is banks with higher incentives to gamble and for regulatory arbitrage,
increase their exposure to Italian and Spanish sovereign debt more relative to other banks.
High Tier 1 banks, for example, decreased their exposure to Italy in 2011 while low
Tier 1 banks even marginally increased their holdings. This is intuitive as those banks have
capital to support reinvesting in assets with higher RWA and absorb possible write-offs from
divesting Italian sovereign bonds which have substantially lost in value after Italy has been
downgraded to A in September 2011.
While non-domestic banks increased their holdings in Italian and Spanish bonds
relatively more than domestic banks between March and December 2010, this trend reversed
between January and June 2012. Domestic banks increased their holdings while non-domestic
banks even decreased their sovereign bond exposures. These results indicate an increase in home
bias in the first half of 2012 which has been funded by the ECB. In December 2011 and February
2012, the ECB injected about EUR 1 trillion in two three-year LTROs into the banking system at
an initial interest rate of 1% at that time.23 Panel D of Table 3 reports the change in Italian and
23

Since then, the interest rate on these funds has decreased to 0.75%.

18

Spanish sovereign bond holdings of our sample banks between January and June 2012. We
aggregate all individual bank exposures to the country level and distinguish between changes in
bond holdings with maturities equal / smaller than three years and greater than three years. If
banks use LTRO funds for new carry trades and match the maturities of the securities they
purchase with the maturity of these funds we expect to see increases in sovereign debt holdings
particularly for maturities equal or below three years.24

The data show that Italian banks

increased Italian sovereign bond holdings with a maturity of equal / below three years by EUR
28.6 billion and longer dated bonds by EUR 7.8 billion. Similarly, Spanish banks increased their
exposure to Spanish sovereign bonds by EUR 6 billion with a maturity of equal / below three
years and EUR 6.6 billion with maturities above three years.25 Some non-GIPSI banks have
increased their exposure, for example, French banks increased their Italian bond holdings by
EUR 3.1 billion. Overall, however, these exposure changes were small in comparison to
purchases by Italian or Spanish banks and holdings were, on average, rather reduced than
increased. Taken together, these results indicate that carry trades with Italian and Spanish
sovereign debt have been done by domestic banks consistent with the notion that “home bias” has
increased over time funded by the ECB.
5. Estimating Banks’ Carry Trade Exposure Using Multifactor Models
In this section, we investigate the carry trade behavior of European banks inferring
banks’ peripheral sovereign debt as well as short term funding exposures through sensitivities of
banks’ equity with GIPSI and German sovereign bond returns. We then provide a series of
robustness and falsification tests to support our interpretation of carry trade behavior among

24

Note that Panel B of Table 3 reports holding changes. That is, if banks use the funds to simply replace maturing
bonds or to replace own funding with ECB funding, this is not recognized in this analysis. Only increases in euro
exposures are recognized as “new” carry trades.
25
However, about EUR 12 billion short term bonds have matured between December 2011 and June 2012, net
purchase of Spanish banks were thus about EUR 19 billion.

19

European banks and to demonstrate that this behavior is bank specific and does not extend to
hedge funds, non-European banks and non-financial firms providing further support for a bank
specific motivation (such as regulatory arbitrage) that drives bank behavior.
A. Methodology: Measuring Banks’ Carry Trade Exposure
Unfortunately, micro level data of sovereign bond positions are unavailable to us on a
high frequency basis. Furthermore, banks may be exposed to sovereign bond risk other than
through direct bond positions, for example, through credit default swap positions and
counterparty exposure in derivatives transactions with governments. Given this limitation and to
link bank risk to both the investment and funding leg of the carry trade, we use multifactor
models in which the sensitivities of banks’ stock returns to sovereign bond returns are measures
of banks’ exposure to sovereign debt. The lack of micro level changes in portfolio holdings of
banks gives these tests more power and increases the efficiency of the estimates.26 More
precisely, we estimate the following regression

is an estimate of bank i’s short term funding exposure.

The negative factor loading suggests that banks are “short” long-term German bonds. This
reflects a “flight to quality” of investors who purchase long-term safe (German) government
bonds, at the same time reducing the supply of short-term capital. If long-term bond prices
appreciate whenever short-term funding dries up and banks are exposed to short-term funding,
then it appears as if banks were short long-term bonds.

,

0 and

,

0 is

consistent with a “carry trade” behavior of European banks: they appear to have invested in longterm government bonds financed in the short-term wholesale market to maximize the carry
between both legs of the trade.
[Table 4]
Panel A of Table 4 provides descriptive statistics of the estimated carry trade exposures,
for the full sample of banks and separately for GIPSI and non-GIPSI banks. The factor loadings
are estimated quarterly and averaged across all banks. The mean factor loadings for peripheral
bond exposure (Italy and Spain) are positive and suggest, on average, more exposure of banks to
Italian sovereign debt. A large negative loading of German bunds indicates the funding pressure
on banks during our sample period due to a flight to quality of investors. Interestingly, the factor
loadings for Italian and Spanish bonds are larger for the non-Italian and non-Spanish banks,
respectively. This suggests that non-domestic banks had large exposures to the periphery. The
pre-2007 carry trade estimates show that the exposure estimates were close to zero and
sometimes even small and negative before the yield spreads widened in mid-2008 supporting our
hypothesis that banks have built substantial carry trade positions as bets on the convergence of
sovereign bond yields in the euro area.
B. “Carry trade” behavior of European banks

21

We estimate regression equation (1) using pooled OLS regressions and cluster standard
errors at two dimensions, bank and quarter, to account for (unobserved but time-variant) variation
that is both bank specific in different quarters and that is common across all banks in the same
quarter. The results are reported in Panel B of Table 4.
The estimated values of

and

represent the cross-sectional averages of

European banks’ carry trade exposure. We also estimate (1) for each bank individually. Our
results indicate that banks’ stock returns are very sensitive to peripheral sovereign bond returns.
Model (1), for example, estimates the sensitivity of stock returns to Greek government bond
returns. The positive factor loading suggests an (unhedged) exposure of banks to Greek
government debt. All other factor loadings are (when employed individually) positive and
significant and the exposure seems largest with respect to Italian and Spanish government debt.
Model (6) estimates the sovereign debt exposures collectively. The R² of the models show that a
substantial proportion of the variation in stock returns is explained by these covariates.
is negative and large in magnitude indicating banks’ funding pressure caused by their exposure to
short-term debt. Overall, our results are consistent with a carry trade behavior of European banks.
C. Robustness of our carry trade estimates
In Table 5, we report a series of robustness tests that supports the notion of carry trade
behavior of European banks.
[Table 5]
We first construct an index of bond returns using the daily average return of sovereign
bonds from Euro area members other than GIPSI countries or Germany or France (Bond Index).
If banks invested in GIPSI government debt to exploit the highest yielding sovereign
investments, banks’ stock returns should be less sensitive to the return of this index. Model (1) of

22

Table 5 reports a regression including Bond Index as separate control variable and, as expected,
its coefficient is not statistically significant.
Banks are also the largest domestic bond investors. A higher sensitivity of bank equity to
sovereign bond returns could also reflect a lower ability or willingness of the domestic
government to bail out a distressed bank. It could also reflect a higher exposure to the domestic
sovereign through bond holdings (“home bias”). To address both concerns, we include the home
country bond return (Home) of each bank in model (2). Home, as an example, reflects the amount
of Italian government debt that is held by Italian banks. The positive factor loading on the banks’
home country bond return indicates that banks are exposed to sovereign bonds of their home
country. The factor loadings of Italian and German bonds do not change materially suggesting
Italian bonds as primary asset class for carry trades.
We include a variety of other macroeconomic state variables to control for changes in
macroeconomic fundamentals that could drive both stock and sovereign bond prices, namely: (i)
VSTOXX, the European counterpart to the VIX index in the US, is the change in the volatility
index of the European stock market; (ii) TermStructure is the slope of the term structure of
interest rates measured as the difference between the yield on a ten-year euro area government
bond and the one-month Euribor; (iii) BondDefSpread is the difference between the yield on tenyear German BBB bonds and yields on ten-year German government debt; (iv) 1mEuribor is the
level of the short-term risk-free interest rate measured as the one-month Euribor; (v) ∆ESI is the
monthly change in the economic sentiment indicator obtained from opinion surveys conducted by
the European Central Bank; (vi) ∆IntProd is the monthly change in the level of industrial
production; (vii) ∆CPI is the change in the rate of inflation measured as the monthly change in
the European Consumer Price Index. Model (3) reports the results. Most importantly, the factor
loadings do not change including these variables.
23

The sovereign debt market is characterized by a high degree of collinearity as shown in
Table 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) offers a way to construct different linear
combinations of the factor returns that are uncorrelated with each other using the covariance
matrix of the returns. As the covariance matrix is symmetric, it has linearly independent
eigenvectors corresponding to the number of positive eigenvalues. The eigenvectors are called
principal components and are ranked according to the eigenvalue. The first principal component
(PC1) is the linear combination of GIPSI bond returns with the highest eigenvalue. It is the
component that explains the largest part of the variation in GIPSI bond returns. Instead of using
the GIPSI returns as independent variables, we regress the banks’ stock return on PC1 and
Germany. We find a positive and significant relationship between PC1 and stock returns (model
(4)), which is consistent with a carry trade behavior of banks.
In model (5) we substitute French for German government bonds and find a negative and
significant value for

, which is smaller in magnitude compared to the factor loadings of

German bunds. This is reflecting the increasing divergence of yields between French and German
government debt that started in 2011. The coefficients of Greece and Italy are even stronger. In
model (6), we include the Fama-French factors SMB and HML, however, the results remain
unchanged.28
Carry trade exposure should also be reflected in CDS spreads as an important proxy for
bank risk and funding costs. We expect to see that CDS spreads reflect a widening of the gap
between GIPSI bond and German bund yields, either through an increase in peripheral bond
yields or if funding conditions deteriorate. We test this in models (7) and (8) and use Δ Log (Bank
CDS) as a dependent variable, which is the change in the natural logarithm of daily bank CDS
spreads. As reported in column (7), the coefficient of Greek bond returns is negative and
28

HML and SMB are measured for European portfolios and available on Kenneth French’s website since 1990.

24

significant, whereby, if Greek bond prices fall, banks experience, on average, an increase in their
CDS spreads. Moreover, if German bund prices appreciate, banks’ funding costs also rise, ceteris
paribus, pointing to their exposure to short-term wholesale markets. The PCA in model (8) shows
a similar result. Overall, and across our various tests, we find strong evidence consistent with a
carry trade behavior of European banks.29
D. Alternative return indices
We provide a variety of falsification tests as to the incentives of European banks versus
other financial and non-financial firms to load up on GIPSI sovereign exposures. US banks, for
example, were systematically recapitalized after the US mortgage crisis. European banks, on the
other hand, were, and still are, undercapitalized based on various standards (such as leverage
ratios). Moreover, US banks cannot use sovereign debt to the same extent as collateral for
liquidity as European banks. A similar argument applies to UK banks. Many of them have been
nationalized and their capital position strengthened after the financial crisis. They also do not
have access to the ECB using peripheral debt as collateral. We thus expect to find smaller
estimates on similar tests using US or UK banks. A third set of firms we consider are nonfinancial (industrial) firms which do not have similar incentives such as gambling or regulatory
capital arbitrage as banks which should also be reflected in the carry trade estimates.
We run a series of tests with various index returns as dependent variables. There are: (1) a
value weighted index of all EBA banks in our sample; (2) a value weighted index of UK banks;
(3) a value weighted index of the 100 largest US banks based on market values; (4) a HFRX
Macro Hedge Fund Index; (5) an equally weighted industrial index formed from the underlying
29

We perform a series of further tests that remain unreported for brevity. We include bank fixed effects to control for
time-invariant bank characteristics. In other tests, we use bond yield changes instead of bond returns. We also
construct an equally weighted portfolio of bank stocks from our sample and estimate a time-series regression. In
separate tests, we exclude broker-dealer banks. These banks might have larger portfolios due to this specific
function. Lastly, we use weekly (instead of daily) stock returns. In all tests, our results from Table 4 remain
qualitatively unchanged.

Germany index; (7) an equally weighted index of the most important countries in Europe other

the MSCI Industrial UK index.
[Table 6]
Table 6 reports the results from OLS regressions. Control variables include the FamaFrench Factors SBM and HML. As market return, we include the Euro Stoxx 600 index for
European indices, the S&P 500 index for the US banks and MSCI World for the HFRX Macro
Hedge Fund index. Standard errors are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and auto-correlation using
Newey-West with 8 lags. Column (1) shows the time-series estimates for all EBA banks which
reflect our earlier cross-sectional results. We do not find statistically significant exposure of UK
banks to peripheral sovereigns (column (2)). Moreover, the value of

is much smaller

indicating lower funding exposure. Column (3) reports the result for US banks echoing the results
for UK banks.31 We use daily returns of the HFRX Macro fund as dependent variable in column
(4). The results are intriguing and suggest that macro hedge funds are betting against Italy but are
long German bunds, thus effectively taking the opposite positions in trades with European banks.
Columns (5) to (8) show sensitivities of country specific industry indices to GIPSI and German
sovereign debt. Overall, the betas are close to zero and mostly insignificant.
6. Factor Loadings, Sovereign Bond Holdings & Liquidity Risk
In this section, we show that our carry trade estimates are measuring banks’ investment
and funding risk exposure. Moreover, we show that they reflect sovereign risk exposure rather
than exposure of international banks to the real sector of the periphery.
30

We exclude Ireland and Greece from this index due to missing data in the respective industrial index.
We also run these results for a portfolio of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of
America. It has frequently been claimed that these banks had huge counterparty exposure to the GIPSI countries. We
do not find significant exposures to either of the GIPSI sovereigns.
31

26

A. Results from Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR)
Do these exposures relate to actual government bond holdings of banks or simply reflect
some other underlying economic exposures and linkages? And what determines banks’ liquidity,
i.e. short-term funding, risk? To address these important questions, we exploit bank level data on
sovereign bond holdings and short-term funding exposure. Since June 2010, the EBA has
disclosed bank level sovereign bond holdings reported during five sequential stress tests.32 If

sovereigns,

if banks’ have higher reported holdings.
We were arguing above that the negative factor loading of German bond returns reflects a
flight-to-quality from short-term investors into long-term German government bonds. We thus
expect to see cross-sectional differences in the factor loadings across banks arising from their
short-term funding exposure. An important source of funding risk for European banks is their
exposure to US money market mutual funds (MMF). Ivashina, Scharfstein and Stein (2012), for
example, show that the reduction in US-Dollar lending by US MMF caused a significant decline
in the dollar lending relative to euro lending by European banks which was not the case for US
banks.
[Figure 3]
Figure 3.A shows US MMF’s exposure to European banks since October 2010. As
explained above, new regulation enforced by the SEC made it mandatory for MMF to disclose
the NAV of their investments on a monthly basis. In 2011 alone, US MMF funds withdrew about
USD 167 billion in repurchase agreements and commercial paper from European banks. Figure
3.B shows the percentage withdrawal from individual banks in 2011. US MMF completely
eliminated their exposure to seven banks in the Eurozone, among them Dexia S.A. Other banks,

is also negative and significant suggesting that even if banks do not have US MMF exposure,
they are still subject to short-term funding risk. In unreported test, we also analyze the effect of
other measures of liquidity risk (LIQ) on banks’ sensitivity to German bunds which have been
used widely in the literature. There are: short-term debt over total debt (ST-LVG) and repurchase
agreements with other banks or the ECB over total assets (Repo / Assets). As expected banks with
more short term debt (relative to total debt) or more repo funding have more negative

.

B. Results from a two-step-procedure
The advantage of the one-step procedure over a two-step procedure is to avoid a
measurement (sampling) error in estimating

and

. The two-step procedure

estimates the factor loadings in a first regression and uses these estimates in a second step to
analyze their determinants. If the sampling error is not constant across banks, this might induce
heteroscedasticity in the second stage regression. More importantly, a possible contemporaneous
correlation between the error terms in estimating (1) could induce a correlation among the factor
loadings which, in turn, could inflate our t-statistics in the second step. However, the SUR
methodology requires a balanced panel restricting the number of time-series observations that can
be used in the regressions. Given the limitations of both approaches, this section presents the
results from the two-step procedure to further investigate the link between our carry trade
estimates and the actual bond holdings from bank disclosures. In a first step, we relate the factor
loadings estimated for each bank in the time period 60 days before and 60 days after each
reporting date on the sovereign bond holdings scaled by total assets. To visualize this

29

relationship, we plot the factor loadings on the sovereign bond holdings for each reporting date
and country separately in Figure 4. We use logs for illustration purposes.
[Figure 4]
The scatterplot shows a positive relationship between factor loadings and portfolio
holdings. We estimate regression (3) to analyze how

holdings in the cross-section of banks. Similar to the one-step-procedure, we scale holdings by
total assets (alternatively by book value of equity) to construct a measure that has the same unit

to be positive. A positive value indicates that the

The results are reported in Appendix IV. Panel A of Appendix IV shows the result for
exposures to Italian and Spanish government bonds. The standard errors are White’s

one percent level which supports our methodology to infer banks’ exposure to sovereign debt
through the sensitivity of the banks’ equity returns to sovereign bond returns. This result extends
to Spanish bonds as investment leg of the carry trade as well as book equity as alternative scaling
factor.

Sheppard, 2001). This plot strikingly shows the co-movement of
withdrawals. Figure 5.B. explores the correlation between

an important determinant of banks’ liquidity problems.

previous MMF exposure and short-term debt as alternative deflators) over the full sample period

that banks that experience larger withdrawals from US MMF have more negative factor
loadings.34

In a second step, we use the data on banks’ real sector exposure in each country. One
could argue that our factor loadings reflect cross-border investments of internationally active
banks rather than exposure to sovereign debt. We construct a new variable Italy-Real/Assets

We also scale MMF changes by book value of equity. Moreover, we repeat all cross-sectional tests using Spanish
government bonds as investment leg of the carry trade. The results are qualitatively similar but not reported for

which is the sum of each bank’s exposure to firms, the retail sector (including retail real estate)
and commercial real estate scaled by total assets. The real sector exposure to Spain is constructed
accordingly. Table 8 reports the results of regressions of our factor loadings estimated 60 days
before and after 31 Dec 2010 on real sector and sovereign exposure.
[Table 8]
Using Italy as an example, models (1) and (2) show that our factor loadings are positively
related to reported sovereign and real sector exposure in separate regressions. Model (3) includes
both types of exposures and model (4) excludes Italian banks. Particularly in our sample of nonItalian banks, we find that sovereign holdings explain our factor loadings while real sector
exposures are not significantly related to the latter. Interestingly, around this reporting date, we
do not find a significant relationship between factor loadings and sovereign holdings among the
sample of non-Spanish banks. These findings point to interesting differences and dynamics
between countries and over time. They also suggest that Italian sovereign debt is the primary
asset class for banks’ investment in carry trades.
7. Carry Trade Incentives
Who is doing the carry trades? In this section, we look at various explanations driving
this behavior and focus in particular on regulatory capital arbitrage and risk shifting. We then
show that actual portfolio holdings of banks are driven by the same factors as our carry trade
estimates. In the last part of this section, we analyze the time-series of carry trade estimates and
explain important differences in the behavior of GIPSI versus non-GIPSI banks, particularly after
the massive liquidity injections by the ECB in December 2011 and February 2012.
A. Factor loadings and bank risk
The primary hypothesis studied in this paper is that investment behavior of European
banks reflects a moral hazard behavior in the form of risk taking that exploits low risk weights of
32

risky government bond positions. Particularly under-capitalized banks are more likely to invest in
carry trades to comply with regulatory capital requirement (“regulatory arbitrage”) and / or to
shift risk betting on their own survival (“risk shifting”).
We use various bank risk factors, such as bank size (Log-Assets), short-term leverage
(ST-LVG) and the size of the loan portfolio (Loans/Assets) to investigate the investment behavior
of European banks. In all tests, we use the one-year lagged bank characteristics.35 As in previous
tests, standard errors are clustered at the bank and quarter level. We include all risk proxies
individually and collectively and run regressions on the full sample of banks. The results are
reported in Table 9.
[Table 9]
We document that larger banks (that is banks with more international focus, more
wholesale funding and that are more systemically important) have larger sovereign exposures to
Italy. Also, riskier banks, i.e. banks with more short-term leverage and loan to asset ratios have
more exposure. These results provide strong support for the carry trade hypothesis but are not
consistent with alternative hypotheses such as home bias.36 We document similar results as to
European banks’ exposure to Spanish sovereign debt.
A further motive as to why banks are heavily invested in government debt is regulatory
capital arbitrage because of how banks’ balance sheet exposure to sovereign debt is treated under
existing capital rules. Basel II encourages banks to hold sovereign debt. The Capital Requirement
Directive (CRD) assigns a zero risk weight for “exposures to Member States’ central government

35

ST Debt and Loans/Assets are included in addition to the interaction terms in the respective models as well as a
constant term, but all remain unreported for brevity. Log-Assets is added as a control variable in all models.
36
Analyzing a subsample of Italian banks, we find that larger Italian banks have more exposure to their own
domestic sovereign debt. Interestingly, riskier Italian banks have lower sovereign exposure suggesting that moral
hazard (even though there is some evidence) is not the only motive of these banks to hold domestic sovereign debt.
Among Spanish banks, we find strong evidence consistent with carry trade behavior.

33

[…] denominated and funded in the domestic currency of that central government” (BIS, 2011).37
That is, despite (even little) differences in country ratings, banks are allowed to reduce the capital
they hold against these positions to zero. Consequently, particularly undercapitalized banks, that
is, banks with low Tier 1 capital ratios, have an incentive to shift their portfolios into assets with
lower risk weights (regulatory capital arbitrage). We test this hypothesis using the Tier 1 ratio,
which is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets, and RWA/Assets as proxies
for capital adequacy. Table 9 contains the results of the cross-sectional regressions. We report the
results again separately for Italy (column (2)) and Spain (column (4)). In all regressions, we
include Log-Assets as well as interaction terms with GIPSI and Germany to control for bank size.
Again, we focus on banks’ exposure to Italy first. Consistent with our earlier results, we
find that larger banks have a larger exposure to Italian sovereign debt. We find that banks with
higher Tier1 capital ratios have lower exposure to Italian sovereign debt. Tier 1 capital increases
if banks have higher RWA or if they decide to hold more economic capital. For a given amount
of RWA, the negative coefficient implies higher risk-shifting incentives. Moreover, the positive
coefficient on RWA/Assets (unlike the sign on Tier1) suggests that there is a regulatory arbitrage
motive. Only including one of these variables might result in biased estimates of the coefficients
due to confounding effects.38 Moreover, we find that banks with high exposure to short-term
funding have significantly more exposure to Italy. Additionally, European banks with more shortterm debt are also more exposed to funding shocks. These results provide strong evidence for

37

Under the standardized approach, sovereign debt has a zero risk weight. Even under the Internal Ratings Based
(IRB) approach there is a loophole. Usually, banks have to hold capital based on an assessment of the default
likelihood estimated with their own internal models. However, they can choose to switch back to the standardized
approach for assessing capital requirements for sovereign debt eventually holding no capital (“IRB permanent partial
use”).
38
In unreported results, we include either Tier 1 or RWA / Assets and find that the coefficient of Tier 1 is less
negative when we do not control for RWA / Assets. This result suggests that the discretionary part of Tier1 capital is
more strongly related to the risk-shifting motive. In other words, not controlling for RWA understates the riskshifting effect.

34

carry trade (moral hazard) behavior of European banks.39 The results extend to European banks’
exposure to Spanish government debt.40
B. Sovereign bond holdings and bank risk
Our carry trade estimates show that particularly risky and undercapitalized banks are
purchasing more Italian and Spanish sovereign debt consistent with carry trade behavior of these
banks. Therefore and in line with the descriptive results from Table 3, we expect to find also
higher reported Italian and Spanish sovereign bond holdings of these banks around the EBA
stress tests. In separate tests, we regress Italian (Spanish) sovereign debt holdings by our sample
banks (scaled by total assets) on Tier-1 ratio, RWA/ Assets, Loans / Assets and Log-Assets using
OLS regressions. The results are reported in Table 10.
[Table 10]
Bank risk characteristics are lagged by one year and standard errors are clustered at the
bank level. The results reported in column (1) in Panel A suggest that increasing Tier-1 ratios
from the first to the third quartile decreases Italian sovereign bond holdings over total assets by
one percentage point, ceteris paribus. The t-statistic is -4.42 and the R² suggests that a substantial
part of the variation of Italy / Assets can be explained by a bank’s capitalization. Similarly, we
find that banks with higher RWA / Assets and Loans / Assets have higher Italian bond holdings.
Moreover, larger banks also have higher bond exposures. Overall, these tests as well as the
previously reported results are consistent with the interpretation that riskier and weakly

39

Interestingly, we do not find statistically significant evidence that riskier Italian banks (that is, banks with lower
capital ratios or higher RWA or short-term debt) are investing more in domestic sovereign debt, which is in line with
our earlier results. Domestic banks most likely have different motives to invest in own sovereign debt (over and
above the carry trade motive).
40
In unreported tests and in a subsample only Spanish banks, we find strong evidence that even Spanish banks with
low Tier 1 capital ratios and high RWA / Assets invested more in domestic sovereign debt compared to better
capitalized Spanish banks and they also were more exposed to short term funding. In other words, these results are
consistent with carry trade (moral hazard) behavior among Spanish banks.

35

capitalized banks have stronger incentives to invest in carry trades using Italian and Spanish
sovereign debt.
C. Home Bias and LTROs
Our descriptive results suggests a shift in risk exposure to peripheral sovereign debt
from non-GIPSI banks to GIPSI banks through the ECB interventions in December 2011 and
February 2012. In this sub-section, we show that the increase in home bias is also reflected in our
carry trade estimates. We estimate regression (1) and augment the model with time indicator
variables: Before March’10, March’10 – Dec’10, Dec’10 – Sept’11, and After Sept’11. We
interact sovereign bond returns with these indicator variables.

(

) represents

banks’ equity sensitivity to GIPSI (German) bond returns in the period after September 2011,
including the two three year LTROs but also the ECB’s one year LTRO from October 2011. The
interaction terms then show incremental effects in each respective time period. Table 11 reports
the results.
[Table 11]
Columns (1) to (3) report the results for banks’ exposure to Italian sovereign debt and
columns (4) to (6) for the exposure to Spanish sovereign debt. We always run the regression for
the full sample, non-domestic and domestic banks. The full sample results in column (1) and (4)
show that banks, on average, still have substantial exposure to Italian and Spanish sovereign debt.
The exposure, however, has decreased over time as shown by positive and significant coefficients
of the interaction terms. This is consistent with the summary statistics reported in Table 2. This
result extends to the subsample of non-domestic banks (columns (2) and (4)). The subsample of
non-Italian banks reflects the increase in home bias. The factor loading on

is 0.808 (which

is significantly higher as the factor loading of non-Italian banks (0.286, p-value < 0.001)) and the
incremental effects are negative. The incremental effect in the subsample of Spanish banks are
36

insignificant which is consistent with the total exposures summarized in Table 2 indicating that
Spanish banks have reduced their bond holdings since March 2010 to some extent.
8. Conclusion
During the past three years, increasing economic divergence between the core of Europe
and the periphery have caused a surge in the yield spread of peripheral countries (such as GIPSI,
or Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) and a flight to German bunds. Our article argues
that European banks have placed bets on the opposite economic development – convergence –
within the euro area expecting yield spreads between, for example, Italy and Germany or Spain
and Germany to converge. These bets or “carry trades” were designed as investments in GIPSI
government bonds financed with short-term debt. As the sovereign debt crisis deepened,
European banks lost a substantial portion of their market value. In a series of cross-sectional and
time-series tests, we find evidence that these trades have been widespread among European
banks, not just GIPSI banks but even non-GIPSI European banks. We find convincing evidence
for bank moral hazard and regulatory capital arbitrage in that large banks, banks with more shortterm debt, and undercapitalized banks with high risk-weighted assets, are more likely to engage
in carry trades employing low risk-weight GIPSI government bonds to earn higher and riskier
returns on their diminished economic capital while meeting regulatory capital requirements.
Several policy implications stem from our empirical findings. One, under-capitalized
banking sectors as the European countries had at the end of the financial crisis of 2007-08 can
lead to subsequent problems through excess risk-taking, a theme that is reminiscent of the
Japanese banking crisis of the 90’s (see Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap, 2008). The European
response in Fall of 2008 and early 2009 featured more debt and asset guarantees than bank
recapitalization, unlike the United States, and the ongoing sovereign crisis has again left several
banks under-capitalized sufficiently to the point that their market funding has dried up.
37

Second, simply restoring bank capitalizations up to regulatory risk weight based
requirements does not suffice in environments where the regulatory risk weights have become out
of sync with market’s perception of risk of assets and indeed the underlying fundamental risk of
assets, the zero risk weights on sovereign bonds of peripheral countries being far from being riskfree to deserve such regulatory capital treatment. Worse, the continuation of reliance on such
outdated risk weights, as in the first two stress tests of 2010 in Europe, can give under-capitalized
banks perverse incentives to shift portfolios towards assets with low risk weight but high
economic risk and return. In the case of Europe, this created a strengthening of the nexus
between sovereign and financial sectors, making sovereign crises in southern periphery a panEuropean concern. The stress tests of July 2011 in Europe did address the zero risk-weight issue
more seriously and the outcomes – at least for non-GIPSI banks – since then have been more
salubrious and their GIPSI bond holdings shrunk.
Third, the European Central Bank’s LTRO facilities appear to have provided funding to
domestic Spanish and Italian banks to significantly build up their exposures to their sovereign
debt, a move that should have helped the sovereigns in question. However, the resulting “home
bias” in debt holdings of these sovereigns has nevertheless strengthened the financial sector and
sovereign’s nexus in the periphery, implying that a further deterioration of the sovereign health
would lead to a significant peripheral crisis, even if not a fully pan-European one (in similar
magnitude). Again, this form of ECB funding does not tackle head on the problem of bank
recapitalization for GIPSI banks and their incentives to load up on sovereign debt – and of their
sovereigns to encourage (or not discourage) such home bias – remain unaddressed.
Finally, our results highlight the link between asset-side risk and short-term funding
problems of banks which has been ignored in the Basel-II regulation. The new Basel-III
framework addresses liquidity problems of banks requiring them to comply with new liquidity
38

ratios. However, it is still heavily debated as to which assets count as being “liquid”. If sovereign
bonds and other risky securities fall into that category, banks will have similar incentives to loadup on these assets as when they had zero risk weights for capital requirements. Going forward it
will be important to investigate how bank solvency and liquidity risk interact. When assets held
by banks are risky, this generates funding problems for these banks if they heavily rely on shortterm wholesale funding. The months following the 3rd European stress-test showed some relief
for non-GIPSI banks’ funding conditions. For the first time, regulators stressed sovereign risk and
eventually required banks to increase their regulatory capital which has been addressed at least by
some banks issuing new equity. Non-GIPSI banks also broadly reduced their risky sovereign debt
positions. Again, this suggests that banks’ incentives to load-up on risky assets is driven by low
capital requirements to hold them on their balance sheets and similar regulatory arbitrage of
Basel-III liquidity requirements would have to be factored in by the regulators.

Increasing Sovereign Exposure
This table analyses changes in bond holdings between March and December 2010, January and December 2011 as
well as between January and June 2012. Panel A reports the change in holdings in Italian and Spanish sovereign debt
of Italian and non-Italian (Spanish and non-Spanish) banks as well as the percentage change. Panel B reports the
change in Italian (Spanish) bond holdings scaled by total assets segregated by risk factors. High Tier 1 is an indicator
variable equal to 1 if a bank’s Tier 1 ratio is in the first quartile of the distribution among all banks. High
RWA/Assets and High Loans/Assets are indicator variables equal to 1 if the bank’s RWA/Assets ratio and
Loans/Assets ratio are within the upper quartile of the distribution among all banks. Panel C reports changes in
sovereign bond holdings by publicly listed European banks between Dec 31st, 2011 and June 30th, 2012 aggregated
to the country level. Changes are reported by bond maturity. <= 3 years (> 3 years) denotes bonds that have a

Banks’ Carry Trade Behavior Estimates
This table contains the results of a pooled OLS regression of banks’ stock returns on sovereign bond returns during
the 2007 to 2012 period. Columns (1) to (5) of Panel A show factor loadings on GIPSI sovereign bond returns
individually for Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland and jointly in column (6). All regressions include ten-year
German bond returns (
, ) as the “funding leg” of the carry trade.
, is the residual from the regression
of the domestic stock market’s daily returns on daily 10 year domestic sovereign bond and German bond returns.
***,** and * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10% levels respectively.

Table 5
Robustness
This table contains the results of a pooled OLS regression of banks’ stock returns on sovereign bond returns during the 2007 to
2012 period. Model 1 includes BondIndex, the daily average return of sovereign bonds from Euro area members other than GIPSI
countries or Germany or France. Model 2 reports factor loadings of home country bond returns (Home). Model 3 includes various
macro variables: (1) VSTOXX is the return of the VSTOXX Index; (2) TermStructure is measured as the difference between the
yield on a ten-year euro area government bond and the one-month Euribor; (3) BondDefSpread is the difference between the yield
on ten-year German BBB bonds and yields on ten-year German government debt; (4) 1mEuribor is measured as the one-month
Euribor; (5) ∆ESI is the monthly change in the European economic sentiment indicator; (6) ∆IndProd is the monthly change in the
level of industrial production; (7) ∆CPI is the change in inflation measured as the monthly change in the European Consumer Price
Index. Model 4 reports the results of a principal component analysis (PCA); Model 5 uses French bond returns as the funding leg
of the carry trade; Model 6 includes Fama-French factors (SMB, HML). Models 7 and 8 report the results of the cross-sectional
analyses of bank CDS spread changes on GIPSI bond returns. The dependent variable in both models is Δ Log (Bank CDS).
Standard errors are clustered at bank and quarter level. t-statistics are given in parentheses. ***,** and * indicate significance at 1,
5 and 10% levels respectively.

Alternative Return Indices
This table reports the results from OLS regressions of daily returns on a value weighted index of EBA Banks (EBA Banks),
UK banks (EBA UK Banks), US Banks, macro hedge funds (HFRX Macro), and various country specific industrial indices
during the 2007 to 2012 period. There are: MSCI GIPSI, which is an equally weighted index formed from the underlying
indices for Italy, Spain and Portugal, MSCI Germany, MSCI Non GIPSI, which is an equally weighted index of the most
important countries in Europe other than Germany or the periphery (France, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Sweden),
and MSCI UK. As market return, we include the Euro Stoxx 600 (STOXX 600) for European indices, the S&P 500
(S&P500) for the US index and MSCI World for the HFRX Macro Hedge Fund index. We also include the Fama-French
Factors (SMB and HML). The standard errors were adjusted for heteroscedasticity and auto-correlation using Newey-West
with 8 lags. ***,** and * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10% levels respectively.

Table 10
Carry Trade Behavior and Bank Risk
This table reports the results from OLS regressions of bank’s individual bond holdings on bank risk factors: LogAssets, ST-LVG, Loans-Assets, Tier 1 and RWA/Assets. Holdings are available during the March 2010 to June 2012
period and are scaled by banks’ total assets. Panel A (Panel B) reports the results for exposures to Italian (Spanish)
sovereign debt. All bank characteristics are lagged by 1 year (half-year if available). Standard errors are clustered at
the bank level. t-statistics are given in parentheses. ***,** and * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10% levels
respectively.
