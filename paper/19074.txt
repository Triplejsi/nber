ABSTRACT
This paper introduces dynamics in the R&D-to-innovation and innovation-to-productivity relationships,
which have mostly been estimated on cross-sectional data. It considers four nonlinear dynamic simultaneous
equations models that include individual effects and idiosyncratic errors correlated across equations
and that differ in the way innovation enters the conditional mean of labor productivity: through an
observed binary indicator, an observed intensity variable or through the continuous latent variables
that correspond to the observed occurrence or intensity. It estimates these models by full information
maximum likelihood using two unbalanced panels of Dutch and French manufacturing firms from
three waves of the Community Innovation Survey. The results provide evidence of robust unidirectional
causality from innovation to productivity and of stronger persistence in productivity than in innovation.

Introduction

For decades, R&D and innovation have been recognized by scholars and policy makers as major
drivers of country, industry and ﬁrm economic performance. Many of the early studies, following
the lead of Griliches (1979), used an augmented production function with R&D capital to estimate
the returns to R&D at the ﬁrm level. More recently, many studies relied on innovation survey
indicators and on the CDM framework to analyze simultaneously a knowledge production function
relating innovation output to R&D, and an augmented production function linking productivity to
innovation output (Crépon et al., 1998; Mairesse et al., 2005; Griﬃth et al., 2006). Both the eﬀects
of R&D on innovation output and of innovation output on productivity are usually found to be
positive and signiﬁcant in these studies. Most of them, however, are based on cross-sectional data
and cannot take into account the dynamic linkages between innovation and economic performance
nor unobserved ﬁrm heterogeneity. This is where the present study comes into play.1 More
speciﬁcally, using data from three waves of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for France
and the Netherlands, we examine whether there is evidence of persistence in ﬁrm innovation and
productivity and of bidirectional causality between them.2
There are several reasons why one should introduce dynamics in the interrelationships between
R&D, innovation and productivity. Firstly, the time lag between a ﬁrm’s decision to invest in R&D,
the associated R&D outlays and the resulting innovation success may be substantial because of
‘time to build’, opportunity cost and uncertainty inherent to the innovation process (Majd and
Pindyck, 1987). For example, the studies of knowledge production function using ﬁrm panel data,
where patents proxy for knowledge, specify a relation of patents to distributed lags of R&D (Pakes
and Griliches, 1980; Hall et al., 1986). Secondly, scholars argue that a successfully innovative ﬁrm
is more likely than a non-innovating ﬁrm to experience innovation success in the future, in other
words, that ‘success breeds success’. Several papers have investigated the persistence of innovation
success, measured by the number of granted patents (Geroski et al., 1997), the introduction of
new or signiﬁcantly improved products (Peters, 2009) or production methods (Flaig and Stadler,
1994), or the share in total sales accounted for by sales of these products (henceforth the share of
innovative sales) (Raymond et al., 2010). Thirdly, it is also argued that the economic performance
of a ﬁrm, especially of a repeatedly innovating ﬁrm, is likely to exhibit persistence. For instance,
Bailey et al. (1992), Bartelsman and Dhrymes (1998), and Fariñas and Ruano (2005) ﬁnd strong

are important diﬀerences between France and the Netherlands, in particular the size of the two countries,
the industrial composition, the extent of external trade and institutional and regulatory changes in our study period.
It is not clear a priori how these diﬀerences impact directly the ﬁrm innovation and productivity relationships between
the two countries. We consider it interesting and important to compare them for the sake of scientiﬁc replication
(see Hamermesh, 2007).

evidence of persistence of ﬁrm level productivity diﬀerentials using transition probabilities on the
quintiles or deciles of the distribution of these diﬀerentials over time, or using kernel techniques
to estimate the conditional distribution of ﬁrm level productivity at period t given productivity
at period t − 1. Finally, because of information asymmetry, ﬁrms may be more willing to rely on
retained earnings rather than to seek external funding for their future innovations (Bhattacharya
and Ritter, 1983), implying a feedback eﬀect from productivity to innovation.
To investigate these dynamic aspects, we study four nonlinear dynamic simultaneous equations
models that diﬀer in the way that innovation enters the conditional mean of labor productivity:
through an observed binary indicator, an observed intensity variable or through the continuous
latent variables that correspond to the observed occurrence or intensity. We describe these models
in detail in Section 2.
We show in Section 3 how to derive the full information maximum likelihood estimator assuming random eﬀects that are correlated with suﬃciently time-varying explanatory variables. More
speciﬁcally, we take care of the initial conditions problem due to the autoregressive structure of
the models and the presence of ﬁrm eﬀects using Wooldridge’s (2005) ‘simple solutions’ approach,
and we handle multiple integration due to the correlations of ﬁrm eﬀects and idiosyncratic errors
across equations using Gauss-Hermite quadrature sequentially along the lines of Raymond (2007,
chapter 6).
In Section 4, we explain the data on which we base our estimations and provide some descriptive statistics. These data come from three waves of the Dutch and the French Manufacturing
Community Innovation Surveys (CIS) for 1994-1996, 1998-2000 and 2002-2004, supplemented by
a few ﬁrm accounting variables. We work with an unbalanced panel to have a larger sample and
thus to weaken possible survivorship biases and to obtain more accurate estimates.
In Section 5 we present our results. For both countries they reveal strong persistence in productivity but weaker persistence in innovation, and they indicate a unidirectional causality running
from innovation to labor productivity. Whereas past innovation matters to productivity, the most
productive enterprises are not more successful in introducing new or signiﬁcantly improved products and do not attain larger shares of innovative sales than the least productive ones.

2

Model speciﬁcations

Our models consist of a knowledge production function and an augmented production function
relating respectively innovation output to R&D and other relevant innovation factors, and productivity to innovation output and other relevant production factors. Four measures of innovation

3

output are considered in the analysis. The ﬁrst is an observed binary variable taking the value
one if an enterprise is a product innovator, and zero otherwise. In the innovation survey, a product innovator is a ﬁrm that has introduced a new or improved product in the last three years.
The second variable is a continuous observed variable, namely the observed innovation intensity,
measured by the share of total sales in year t due to products introduced in the last three years,
i.e. t, t − 1 or t − 2. Although the latter is more informative than the former it is likely to be
more aﬀected by important measurement errors. We also consider the two latent innovation output
variables that underly respectively the propensity to introduce new or improved products on the
market and the potential share of innovative sales. Both latent variables are continuous measures
that substitute in one case for a binary variable and in the other case for a continuous variable
with corner solution. The latent variable speciﬁcation assumes there is an underlying true variable
which is not necessarily zero when it is not observed (e.g. in case of a small incremental innovation)
while the observed speciﬁcation assumes that innovation is well known and possibly equal to zero.
As innovation output later enters as an argument in the production function, it is also not clear
whether it is the observed ex-post or the expected ex-ante innovation that should determine labor
productivity. There are thus both economic and statistical reasons for preferring one speciﬁcation
over the other. We shall compare all four of them.

2.1

Knowledge production function (KPF)

∗
Let y1it
denote a latent variable underlying ﬁrm i’s (i = 1, ..., N ) propensity to achieve product

innovations at period t (t = 0i , ..., Ti ) given past observed occurrence of product innovations y1i,t−1 ,
past labor productivity y3i,t−1 , past R&D and other ﬁrm- and market-speciﬁc characteristics x1it ,
and unobserved ﬁrm heterogeneity α1i .3 Formally
∗
= ϑ11 y1i,t−1 + ϑ13 y3i,t−1 + β ′1 x1it + α1i + ε1it ,
y1it

(2.1)

where ϑ11 and ϑ13 capture the eﬀect of past product innovation occurrence and past productivity
on the propensity to innovate, β ′1 captures the eﬀects of past R&D and other explanatory variables
and ε1it denotes idiosyncratic errors encompassing other time-varying unobserved variables that
∗
∗
aﬀect y1it
. The observed dependent variable, y1it , corresponding to y1it
is deﬁned as

∗
y1it = 1[y1it
> 0],

(2.2)

3 By letting t vary from 0 to T , we allow ﬁrms to enter and exit the sample at diﬀerent periods. 0 denotes the
i
i
i
ﬁrst observation of ﬁrm i in the unbalanced panel data sample and Ti its last observation.

4

where 1[ ] denotes the indicator function taking the value one if the condition between squared
brackets is satisﬁed, and zero otherwise.
∗
Let y2it
denote the ﬁrm’s latent share of innovative sales, or potential innovation intensity,

given past observed innovation intensity y2i,t−1 , past labor productivity y3i,t−1 , past R&D and
other ﬁrm- and market-speciﬁc characteristics x2it , and ﬁrm-speciﬁc eﬀects α2i . Formally
∗
y2it
= ϑ22 y2i,t−1 + ϑ23 y3i,t−1 + β ′2 x2it + α2i + ε2it ,

(2.3)

where the coeﬃcients ϑ22 and ϑ23 capture the eﬀect of past observed share of innovative sales and
past labor productivity on the potential innovation intensity, β ′2 captures the eﬀect of past R&D
and other explanatory variables and ε2it denotes idiosyncratic errors. The observed counterpart
∗
to y2it
is deﬁned as
∗
∗
y2it = 1[y1it
> 0]y2it
.

(2.4)

In other words, the share of innovative sales of ﬁrm i is observed to be positive in period t if its
innovation propensity is suﬃciently large in that period. If not, the share of innovative sales is set
equal to zero.
The product innovation indicator and the share of innovative sales variables are taken from
the innovation survey of the two countries. Since the share of innovative sales lies within the unit
interval, we use a logit transformation in the estimation in order to normalize it over the entire set
of real numbers.4
The set of other explanatory variables includes the log R&D per employee, the log market share,
and size, industry and time dummy variables.5 Due to the lengthy nature of research and innovation
activities, we use lagged R&D to explain innovation occurrence and innovation intensity. We also
thought it better to only consider R&D expenditure for ﬁrms that declare investing continuously
in R&D.6 We include a lagged dummy variable for non-continuous R&D performers to compensate
for the fact that for those ﬁrms we put the R&D expenditure equal to zero. Market share is used at
the three digit industry level as a measure of relative size that can reﬂect market power. It is lagged
in order to avoid possible endogeneity concerns (due in particular to measurement errors in ﬁrm
sales which would aﬀect both our market share and productivity variables).7 We take employment
4 Zero values of the share of innovative sales are replaced by a positive value τ smaller than the minimum positive
1
observed value of that variable, and values one are replaced by a positive value τ2 higher than the second largest
observed value. These choices have a negligible eﬀect on our estimates.
5 In some speciﬁcations, we have also three indicators of the distance to the productivity frontier. We ﬁnd,
however, that they are not statistically signiﬁcant (see Appendix D).
6 R&D expenditure is likely to be a reasonable proxy of R&D capital for these ﬁrms. If we could construct
a measure of R&D capital stock, it would be a better measure to use. We cannot, however, for lack of enough
observations over time.
7 The market share of a ﬁrm is deﬁned as the ratio of its sales over the total sales of the three digit industry it

5

as our measure of ﬁrm absolute size, and since the relation between innovation and size may be
nonlinear, we use four size class indicators: small enterprises (# employees ≤ 50), medium-sized
enterprises (50 < # employees ≤ 250), large enterprises (250 < # employees ≤ 500) and very large
enterprises (500 < # employees), the fourth class being considered as the reference. We control
for industry eﬀects, according to the OECD (2007) technology-based classiﬁcation of high-tech,
medium-high-tech, medium-low-tech, and low-tech industries, using three dummy variables for
the ﬁrst three industry categories and taking low-tech industries as the reference. Such industryspeciﬁc eﬀects capture diﬀerences in technological opportunities (it is easier to innovate in certain
industries than in others) and in intensity of competition (which is expected to be higher in hightech than in low-tech industries). Since our panel consists only of three periods and we need one
for the lagged variables, we need only include a time dummy variable for the period 1998-2000,
with 2002-2004 being the reference. This time dummy controls for macroeconomic shocks and for
inﬂation.

2.2

Augmented production function (APF)

As in the great majority of studies, we assume a Cobb-Douglas APF that we write in terms of a log
linear productivity equation relating labor productivity to labor (i.e., we do not assume a constant
scale elasticity), physical capital per employee (proxied here by physical investment due to the
unavailability of a stock measure), and innovation output. We consider four speciﬁcations where
we explain productivity by latent innovation (i.e. the propensity to achieve product innovations or
potential innovation intensity) or by observed innovation (i.e. innovation occurrence or observed
innovation intensity). In all cases we also condition current labor productivity on its past values
and control for unobserved heterogeneity through ﬁrm eﬀects. Thus, we can write
∗
+ α3i + ε3it ,
y3it = ϑ33 y3i,t−1 + β ′3 x3it + γj yjit

(2.5a)

y3it = ϑ33 y3i,t−1 + β ′3 x3it + γj yjit + α3i + ε3it ,

(2.5b)

∗
∗
with j = 1 or 2 where innovation propensity (y1it
) or potential innovation intensity (y2it
) explains

labor productivity in equation (2.5a), and innovation occurrence (y1it ) or observed innovation
intensity (y2it ) explains labor productivity in equation (2.5b). The coeﬃcient ϑ33 captures the
eﬀect of past labor productivity on current labor productivity, β ′3 captures the eﬀect of standard
belongs to. The latter is obtained by adding up the sales of all ﬁrms in our sample that belong to that industry after
multiplying them by an appropriate raising factor in order to have the total sales of the industry in the population.
As we shall see, a combination of a census and a stratiﬁed random sampling is used to collect the data. In the latter
case, the raising factor is calculated for each stratum as the ratio of the number of ﬁrms in the population of that
stratum over the number of ﬁrms in the corresponding stratum sample.

6

input variables, i.e. employment and physical investment per employee, γj captures the eﬀect of
innovation output on labor productivity, and α3i and ε3it denote time-invariant ﬁrm eﬀects and
idiosyncratic errors. We also control for industry and time eﬀects as in the KPF equations.

3

Full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML)

We shall now explain how to derive the FIML estimator, that is how to take care of the initial
conditions problem due to the autoregressive structure of the models and the presence of ﬁrm
eﬀects, how to write the likelihood function, and how to handle the multiple integration due to the
correlations of ﬁrm eﬀects and idiosyncratic errors across equations.

3.1

Initial conditions

The initial conditions problem stems from the fact that the ﬁrst observed value of the lagged
dependent variables is correlated with the individual eﬀects. Ignoring or inadequately accounting
for this correlation results in a bias of the eﬀect of the lagged dependent variables. Several solutions
have been proposed in the econometric literature. We follow the one suggested by Wooldridge
(2005).
Wooldridge’s ‘simple solutions’ have been originally applied to autoregressive nonlinear singleequation models with individual eﬀects. We adapt the approach to a model with multiple equations.
In other words, we project in each equation the individual eﬀects on the ﬁrst observation of
the corresponding dependent variables and on the observed history of the explanatory variables.
Formally
α1i = b10 + b′11 y 1i0i + b′12 x1i + a1i ,

(3.1)

α2i = b20 + b′21 y 2i0i + b′22 x2i + a2i ,

(3.2)

α3i = b30 + b′31 y 3i0i + b′32 x3i + a3i ,

(3.3)

where y ki0i (k = 1, 2, 3) represents the initial values of the dependent variables, xki = (xki0i +1 , ...,
xkiTi )′ represents the history of (in principle all) the observations of the time-varying explanatory
variables, and ai = (a1i , a2i , a3i )′ denotes the vector of projection errors assumed orthogonal to
y ki0i , xki and εit = (ε1it , ε2it , ε3it )′ . The ancillary parameters bk0 , bk1 and bk2 are to be estimated
alongside the parameters of interest.
Three important remarks are in order regarding equations (3.1)-(3.3). Firstly, if the coeﬃcient
vectors β k contain intercepts, only the sums of those intercepts and bk0 are identiﬁed. Secondly,

7

if the explanatory variables are time-invariant or do not show suﬃcient within variation, then
the coeﬃcients bk2 and β k cannot be separately identiﬁed. As a result, only the suﬃciently
time-varying explanatory variables enter equations (3.1)-(3.3). Thirdly, in order to discriminate
between the eﬀect of the lagged dependent variables and that of the initial values, given the
unbalancedness of the panel, we actually have to include in equations (3.1)-(3.3) two types of
initial values with diﬀerent coeﬃcients for ﬁrms present in all three waves and for those present
only in two waves. Following Wooldridge (2005) we make the following distributional assumptions:

Model with latent innovation propensity
The model with latent innovation propensity as a predictor of labor productivity consists of
equations (2.1)-(2.4) and (2.5a) with j = 1 in equation (2.5a). These equations constitute the
∗
structural form of the model. Since y1it
is unobserved, we cannot, unlike in simultaneous equa-

tions models with observed explanatory variables, derive the likelihood function directly where the
dependent variable is included as a regressor. As a result, FIML estimates can be obtained only
through the likelihood function of the reduced form of the model. The reduced-form equations are
given by equations (2.1)-(2.4) and

Data and descriptive statistics

The data used in the analysis stem from three waves of the Dutch and the French CIS pertaining
to the manufacturing sector, with the exception of the food industry, for the periods 1994-1996
(CIS 2), 1998-2000 (CIS 3) and 2002-2004 (CIS 4). The Dutch and French CIS data are merged
respectively with data from the Production Survey (PS) and the ‘Enquête Annuelle d’Entreprise’
(EAE) that provide information regarding employment, sales and investment.11 For each CIS,
the merged PS and EAE variables pertain to the last year of the three-year period. We consider
enterprises with at least ten employees and positive sales at the end of each period covered by
the innovation survey.12 Note that one of the particularities of the innovation survey is that, for
each period, product innovation occurrence relates to the introduction of a new product over a
three-year period, while the actual share of innovative sales pertains to the last year of the period.
As a result, a one-period lag corresponds actually to four years, a period suﬃciently long to capture
10 As

a matter of fact, adopting this approach is recommended in this case. Indeed, the indicator function that
relates the observed dependent variable, y1it , to the regressors, which would be used in the likelihood function of
the reduced form, is discontinuous and the maximization of the likelihood function of the reduced form is unfeasible.
11 Both Dutch surveys were carried out by the ‘Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek’ (CBS) for the whole manufacturing sector and the two French surveys by the ‘Service des Statistiques Industrielles’ (SESSI) of the French
Ministry of Industry for the manufacturing sector excluding the food industry.
12 We delete enterprises with a share of total R&D expenditures (intramural + extramural) in total sales greater
than 50% since they are likely to specialize in doing and trading R&D, hence should be classiﬁed in R&D services
not in manufacturing.

medium- to long-term eﬀects.13 In this paper we consider as innovators only those ﬁrms that have
introduced a product new to the ﬁrm, but not necessarily new to the market.
In the following Tables 1, 2 and 3, we show some simple descriptive statistics, mostly means,
to present our samples and main variables. Table 1 shows, for both countries, the patterns of
enterprises’ presence in the unbalanced panel after data cleaning. Because of the dynamic structure
of the model, an enterprise must be present in at least two consecutive waves of the merged data in
order to be included in the analysis. There are 1920 such enterprises in our sample for France and
1228 for The Netherlands. In both countries about one third of the total number of enterprises are
present in the three waves.
For each pattern, we report the mean and median employment head counts in the sample and in
the population where the head counts in the population are obtained by weighting head counts in
the sample using a raising factor obtained after correcting for non-response. Because of the lower
cut-oﬀ points in The Netherlands and possibly diﬀerences in the rates of non-responses in the two
countries, the diﬀerences in average ﬁrm size between the sample and the population are larger for
France than for The Netherlands. These diﬀerences are, however, smaller in the balanced panel,
which is to be expected since ﬁrms larger than the cut-oﬀ points are all included in the samples
and are also more likely to survive during the whole period 1994-2004. Using the unbalanced panel
allows us to obtain more precise estimates as more observations for broader types of enterprises
are used and also to control partly for survivorship biases as enterprises are allowed to enter and
exit the sample at any period. Overall French enterprises are signiﬁcantly larger than the Dutch
ones both in the sample and in the population, in the balanced as well as in the unbalanced panel.

13 The CIS, PS and EAE data are collected at the enterprise level. A combination of a census and a stratiﬁed
random sampling is used for each wave of the CIS and the PS. A census is used for the population of Dutch
enterprises with at least 50 employees, and a stratiﬁed random sampling is used for enterprises with less than 50
employees, where the stratum variables are the enterprise economic activity and employment in head counts. The
same cut-oﬀ point of 50 employees is applied to each wave of the Dutch CIS and the PS. A similar scheme is used
for the French CIS but a cut-oﬀ point of 500 employees is used in CIS 2 and 3, and one of 250 employees in CIS 4.
The use of diﬀerent cut-oﬀ points in the census/sampling scheme may result in diﬀerences across countries in the
average size of enterprises in our samples and may aﬀect our estimates. If we had aligned the Dutch sampling with
the French sampling we would have lost too many observations for the Netherlands. In the EAE, all enterprises
with at least 20 employees are surveyed.

12

Table 2 gives the means of the non-transformed dependent and explanatory variables for the
unbalanced samples and for the subsamples of product innovators. Comparing ﬁrst all enterprises
with product innovators, it appears that in both countries product innovators do not seem to
be more productive on average. This is due to the existence among non-product innovators of
a few ﬁrms with very high values of sales per employee. When we take the logarithms of sales
per employee, as we do in our estimating equations, we downweigh outlier values and obtain
signiﬁcantly higher productivities for product innovators in both countries. We also observe that
on average in both countries product innovators are larger in terms of employment and have a
larger market share.
Comparing now the two countries, we see that Dutch enterprises, either overall or for product
innovators only, have on average much higher physical investments per employee, larger market
shares but smaller sales per employee than their French counterparts. We also see that the Dutch
innovators have on average a signiﬁcantly higher share of innovative sales but a signiﬁcantly lower
mean R&D per employee than French innovators. It is ﬁnally interesting to note that in France the
majority of product innovators and non-innovators are very large in contrast to The Netherlands
where they are mostly medium-sized enterprises.

Table 3 gives the same statistics as Table 2 but separately for each period of our unbalanced
panel.14 For both countries, we observe a signiﬁcant decrease in the proportion of product innovators and in the mean share of innovative sales between 1994 and 2004. The marked increase of the
14 For each country, the ﬁgures of the various columns of Table 3 are not straightforwardly comparable as there may
be a “wave” eﬀect due to cyclical eﬀects or changes in the wording or in the sampling scheme of the questionnaire.
It is therefore important to control for this eﬀect by including wave-speciﬁc dummies, which we achieve in the
estimation of the various models.

13

share of innovative sales between the last two periods for France is not large enough to oﬀset the
large decrease that occurs between the ﬁrst two periods. We also see, for both countries, a strong
increase in the mean nominal sales per employee and in the mean market share between 1994 and
2004, while on average employment decreases for France and increases for The Netherlands. The
growth that we observe in the mean R&D and physical investment per employee between 1994
and 2004 is relatively modest (and only statistically signiﬁcant for The Netherlands). Although
the diﬀerences between the means of the main variables across countries are informative, it is
important to keep in mind that our estimates are not based on the diﬀerences of most of such
means but on diﬀerences within the two countries, four industry categories as well as within wave
survey patterns, since we estimate our models separately for France and The Netherlands and we
control for ﬁrm eﬀects and also include industry and time dummies in all the model equations, as
explained in Section 2.

Estimation results

We now turn to the results of the estimation of the models. We shall ﬁrst brieﬂy comment on the
general results before discussing the core results of interest, namely the estimated eﬀects of innovation output on productivity and the dynamic interrelations between innovation and productivity.
Tables 4 and 5 present the estimation results for the model with latent innovation as a predictor of
labor productivity, and Tables 6 and 7 present the results for the model with observed innovation

Determinants of innovation and productivity

It is ﬁrst of all remarkable and comforting to notice that the results are quite consistent and robust
across speciﬁcations. We shall return to this ﬁnding in the next subsection. For now, let us take
advantage of it by commenting jointly on the results from the four speciﬁcations.
Tables 4 to 7 show that large ﬁrms are more likely to be product innovators in France while no
such evidence is found for Dutch manufacturing.16 Size does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the innovation
intensities among innovators, a typical result mentioned in Mairesse and Mohnen (2010). A doubling of the very low average market share from 1.5% to 3% is associated to a 3 percentage point
higher propensity to innovate in products and a 4 to 10 percent higher share in total sales due to
new products.17
Overall we ﬁnd evidence of a lagged impact of R&D on innovation. Both in France and in The
Netherlands, enterprises that declare undertaking R&D continuously during the previous two to
four years are more likely to be product innovators and attain a larger share of innovative sales.
The eﬀect of a higher intensity of R&D on present innovation is stronger and more signiﬁcant in
The Netherlands than in France. The estimates show that Dutch ﬁrms with a 1% higher R&D
intensity four years earlier show a 7% higher probability of being a product innovator today, and a
0.13% higher share of innovative sales. The estimates are lower for France where a 1% increase in
R&D intensity four years earlier does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the probability to innovate, although
it corresponds to an increase in the share of innovative sales of about 0.7% (and signiﬁcant at the
10% level).18
The estimated output elasticities of labor and physical capital are all statistically signiﬁcant and
their orders of magnitude are not unreasonable. The coeﬃcient of the log of employment reveals
that the scale elasticity is around 0.97 in France and around 0.93 in The Netherlands, pointing to
slightly decreasing returns to scale. If we subtract the estimated capital elasticity (0.065 for France
and 0.120 for The Netherlands) and assume an output elasticity of materials of 0.5,19 we obtain
an output elasticity of labor of around 0.40 in France and 0.31 in The Netherlands.20
16 Since the reference size category consists of ﬁrms with more than 500 employees, the negative signs for the other
categories indicate a positive size eﬀect.
17 The marginal eﬀects on the probability of the average ﬁrm to become a product innovator, reported in Tables
4-7, are obtained in the usual way, (see Greene, 2011, page 689). Similarly, the marginal eﬀects in the equation of
the share of innovative sales are given by derivating E(y2it |y1it = 1). The expression of this conditional expectation
is given in Greene (2011, page 873).
18 To have a better appreciation of the time span between R&D investment and innovation success, we would of
course need a longer and yearly panel allowing us to estimate a distributed lag model, along the lines for example
of Pakes and Griliches (1980) and Hall et al. (1986) as regards R&D and patents.
19 Assuming that materials account for half of the value of output growth and are priced at their marginal
productivity, we approximate the output elasticity of materials at 0.5. Unfortunately, we do not have data on
materials to estimate their output elasticity.
20 If the capital stock follows the perpetual inventory formula and its growth rate (g) is constant over time, then
it can be shown that log(It ) = log[1 − (1 − δ)/(1 + g)] + log(Kt ). The estimated investment elasticity would then
not be very diﬀerent from the estimated capital stock elasticity.

5.2

The eﬀects of innovation output on labor productivity

Table 8 compares the four sets of elasticities and semi-elasticities of labor productivity with respect
to innovation from Tables 4 to 7, testing on the one hand their equality in the two countries for each
speciﬁcation, and on the other hand the equivalence of the latent and observed model speciﬁcations.
To be more precise we test whether the models with latent and observed innovation output in the
labor productivity equation are equally close to the ‘true’ unknown model. All these elasticities are
positive and highly statistically signiﬁcant except in the case of the observed innovation indicator
for France.
To be more precise we can make the following remarks. Firstly, these estimates are statistically diﬀerent in the two countries only in the speciﬁcation with observed innovation. A product
innovator has on average a 20% higher labor productivity than a non-innovator in Dutch manufacturing and a 6% higher labor productivity in French manufacturing. By contrast, in French
manufacturing a 1% increase in the share of innovative sales raises labor productivity on average
by 0.12%, compared to 0.05% in Dutch manufacturing. Labor productivity is more responsive to
increases in product innovation in French than in Dutch manufacturing enterprises.
Secondly, using Vuong’s (1989) LR test for non-nested hypotheses, we conclude that the models,
with respectively latent and observed innovation output in the labor productivity equation, are
equally close to the ‘true’ unknown model. This result contrasts with that for France by Duguet
(2006) who used a similar test by Davidson and MacKinnon (1981) to conclude that observed
innovation is a better predictor of TFP growth than latent innovation. A likely reason for the
diﬀerence may be that the two-step estimation procedure used by Duguet (2006) ignores the
correlation between the errors in the innovation and productivity equations. In our case, there may
be little diﬀerence between the latent and observed innovation output speciﬁcation because the
modeling of the endogeneity of innovation on the basis of a latent variable is in any case contained
in the combined likelihood function, whether we use latent or observed innovation indicators in
the productivity equation. As for the similarity in the results when using a dichotomous or a
continuous measure of innovation, the explanation could reside in the fact that, with the exception
of the lagged dependent variables and the initial values, we use the same explanatory variables
in both equations. However, in the absence of a full-ﬂedged theoretical model, there is no reason
why these explanatory variables should be diﬀerent as identiﬁcation of the parameters is already
guaranteed by the inclusion of the lagged dependent variables and the initial conditions that are
diﬀerent in both equations.21
21 Lööf (2005) proposes a set of variables that can potentially be used to explain diﬀerently the occurrence of
product innovation and the innovation intensity. These variables, however, are not available in all three waves of the
data for both countries (e.g. human capital, location of main customers) or are only available for innovative ﬁrms

20

We corroborate the ﬁnding of Mairesse et al. (2005) that the estimates of innovation output
in the productivity equation are signiﬁcant only when the endogeneity of innovation is properly
taken into account. For instance, when innovation is treated as exogenous in the productivity
equation, the semi-elasticity of labor productivity with respect to innovation occurrence drops
from 20% to 4% and becomes statistically insigniﬁcant in Dutch manufacturing, and the elasticity
of labor productivity with respect to the observed share of innovative sales decreases from 0.12% to
0.01% in French manufacturing (results not tabulated but available upon request). In our analysis,
the endogeneity of innovation output in the labor productivity equation operates in both types
of models largely through the covariance matrices of the individual eﬀects and the idiosyncratic
errors. The correlations between innovation output and labor productivity, ρε1 ε3 and ρε2 ε3 , being in
general statistically signiﬁcant, the null hypothesis of exogeneity of the innovation output regressor
in the labor productivity equation is clearly rejected at any conventional signiﬁcance level using a
Wald or an LR test.

In order to capture enterprises’ unobserved ability to be innovative and productive we account for
individual eﬀects in each equation of the model. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests reject the absence of
individual eﬀects at the 1% level of signiﬁcance.22 The standard error for the individual eﬀects
explains at least one quarter of the total standard error in each equation. The correlation between
(e.g. partnership in innovation activities).
22 To save space, the results of the LR tests are not reported but can be obtained upon request.

21

the unobserved individual eﬀects in the innovation propensity and the innovation intensity equations is positive and rather high (around 0.5) as expected. Similar omitted variables explain the
occurrence and the intensity of product innovation. The correlations between the idiosyncratic
eﬀects in the two equations after accounting for dynamics, common determinants and individual
eﬀects are so high that we have diﬃculties to estimate them precisely and are forced to ﬁx their
values at 0.99 for France and 0.95 for the Netherlands to avoid convergence problems in the iterative search for a maximum likelihood. There is no signiﬁcant correlation between the individual
eﬀects in the productivity and the innovation equations. Instead, we observe a negative and statistically signiﬁcant correlation, in both countries and in all speciﬁcations, between the idiosyncratic
error terms in the innovation and the labor productivity equations. This phenomenon could be
explained by a missing adjustment cost term: in order to innovate, enterprises may need to increase
their personnel, which in the short run may lead to a decrease in labor productivity because of
adjustment costs and time to learn.

5.4

The dynamics of innovation and productivity

Let us now turn to the central issues of the paper, namely the persistence of innovation and labor
productivity and the direction of causality between innovation and productivity.
Persistence in innovation
In order to assess whether there is true persistence in innovation, as deﬁned in the econometric
literature on panel data, it is important to control for individual eﬀects and initial conditions (Hsiao,
2003). In our case, given that our panels are unbalanced with two or three consecutive observations
by ﬁrm, we have an additional diﬃculty of disentangling the eﬀect of the lagged dependent variable
and of the initial conditions. Indeed, the initial values of the dependent variable on which we must
project the individual eﬀects correspond to a two-period lag for enterprises that are present in
all three periods but to a one period lag for those that are present in only two adjacent periods.
For the latter, the lagged dependent variable is the same as the initial value and therefore the
associated coeﬃcient picks up the sum of the two eﬀects. Without imposing this constraint, we
notice that, as expected, the slope of the initial value for the 2-wave unbalanced panel is practically
equal to the sum of the initial value for the 3-wave balanced panel and the one period lagged eﬀect.
As can be seen in Tables 4 to 7, our results show no evidence of true persistence in product
innovation in Dutch manufacturing neither for the occurrence nor for the intensity of innovation.
In other words, once individual eﬀects and the occurrence and the intensity of innovation in the
initial period are controlled for, achieving successful innovations and generating innovative sales
22

are no longer time dependent in Dutch manufacturing. In contrast, in French manufacturing there
is some evidence in support of the ‘success breeds success’ hypothesis. Nevertheless, the evidence
remains weak as the one-period lagged innovation has less of an eﬀect than innovation in the initial
period. By way of comparison, Raymond et al. (2010) found evidence of true innovation persistence
in Dutch manufacturing but over a diﬀerent time span and only for enterprises operating in hightechnology sectors. True persistence in the occurrence of product or process innovation was found
by Peters (2009) for German manufacturing and service ﬁrms and by Huergo and Moreno (2011)
for Spanish manufacturing ﬁrms. The last two studies, however, only use binary variables on
innovation. The major diﬀerence between these speciﬁcations and the present one is that none of
the previous speciﬁcations estimates the innovation and the productivity equations simultaneously
with a contemporaneous correlation between the corresponding error terms.
Persistence in productivity
For both countries we ﬁnd very strong evidence of true persistence in labor productivity in
all speciﬁcations. Even after controlling for individual eﬀects and initial productivity, one period
lagged productivity conditions current productivity. The fact that highly productive ﬁrms tend to
remain productive and less productive ﬁrms remain less productive is normally taken up by the
initial condition characterizing the individual eﬀect. The lagged productivity term could reﬂect
the inﬂuence of a slowly decreasing stock of knowledge, which is not explicitly modeled but shows
up in the persistence of productivity (see Klette, 1996; Klette and Johansen, 1998; Lokshin et al.,
2008). Part of the persistence of productivity could also reﬂect persistence in ﬁrm market power
given that we have to rely on a revenue measure of productivity in the absence of ﬁrm level price
information to deﬂate gross output. The diﬀerences of persistence in innovation and productivity
could also be due to errors of speciﬁcation in our models, such as large random errors in the
innovation measures or important missing factors in the productivity equation, for example skills,
management practices and organizational characteristics.
Causality
In both countries, there is clear evidence of a unidirectional causality running from innovation to labor productivity during the period that we examine. In other words, four-year lagged
R&D has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on current innovation output which is positively and
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by past innovation output and has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on labor
productivity. We also estimate variants of the CDM model where labor productivity (eqs. (2.5a)(2.5b)) is explained by innovation output in period t and R&D intensity in period t − 1. While
23

innovation output is signiﬁcant in all speciﬁcations, the direct eﬀect of R&D on labor productivity
is insigniﬁcant.23 In contrast, the lagged feedback eﬀect of labor productivity on innovation is not
economically nor statistically signiﬁcant. This result suggests that the most productive enterprises
at period t − 1 do not necessarily invest more in R&D at period t.24 This ﬁnding of unidirectional
causality seems to be new in the empirical literature. It is robust across the four speciﬁcations and
for the two countries.
Furthermore, as can be seen from the estimates documented in Appendix D, enterprises that
were four years earlier closer to the technological frontier, deﬁned in terms of labor productivity,
are not more successful in achieving innovations nor in attaining a larger share of innovative sales.
This result conﬁrms the absence of a feedback eﬀect of labor productivity, more precisely eﬃciency,
on innovation.
Robustness analysis
Table 9 presents the estimation results for the model with latent innovation propensity as a
predictor of labor productivity and radical innovation (i.e. product new the market) as a measure
of innovation output. Our results on the persistence of innovation and labor productivity and the
direction of causality between innovation and productivity are conﬁrmed in this speciﬁcation.25

Conclusion

We have in this study examined whether French and Dutch manufacturing ﬁrms display persistence
in innovation and productivity, whether innovation Granger causes productivity or whether the
reverse holds, whether the dynamics in the R&D-innovation-productivity relationship diﬀers between French and Dutch manufacturing ﬁrms, and ﬁnally whether models with observed or latent,
qualitative or quantitative, innovation indicators yield diﬀerent estimation results. To do so, we
have used unbalanced panels of French and Dutch manufacturing ﬁrms resulting from three waves
of the respective Community Innovation Surveys. With few exceptions, the results we obtain are
not very diﬀerent for the two countries and are robust to various speciﬁcations of the innovationproductivity relationship. As in many related studies based on cross-sectional ﬁrm data, we ﬁnd
23 The estimation results of these variants are not reported but can be obtained upon request. We thank an
anonymous referee for pointing this out.
24 Estimation results from regressions explaining R&D at period t by productivity at period t − 1 are not reported
but can be obtained upon request.
25 To save space, we do not report the estimation results for the model with radical innovation as a measure of
innovation output and latent innovation intensity and observed innovation (indicator and intensity) as predictors of
labor productivity. The results are similar to those of Table 9 and available upon request.
Some studies consider process innovation, product innovation or a combination to explain labor productivities.
They usually face identiﬁcation problems as product and process innovation are highly correlated (see for instance
Hall et al., 2013).

that R&D activities undertaken continuously during the previous two to four years, and the intensity of such activities, aﬀect signiﬁcantly the occurrence and the intensity of product innovations.

25

We ﬁnd weak, if any, evidence of persistence in product innovation, but strong evidence of persistence in labor productivity levels. Both the occurrence and the intensity of product innovation play
an important role in enhancing ﬁrm labor productivity. Past productivity does not, however, aﬀect
product innovation signiﬁcantly. Thus, our results provide evidence of a unidirectional causality
running from innovation to productivity, without a feedback eﬀect, and of a strong persistence
in productivity but not in innovation. Our results are robust to diﬀerent ways of modeling and
estimating and hold for both countries.
In order to assess the generality of the result, it would be interesting to estimate the same
model on more country data and longer periods, which will become possible with additional waves
of innovation surveys in many countries. With the decision, at least in the European Union, to
hold innovation surveys every two years, it would be worthwhile in the future to re-estimate this
model with shorter lags (two years instead of four) and see whether the conclusions regarding the
dynamics of innovation still hold. Productivity increases could also be due to process innovation.
The introduction of process (and possibly other forms of) innovation would require one or more
additional equations, a challenging but not impossible task.

Numerical evaluation of the likelihood of the

After obtaining the conditional likelihood functions shown in equations (3.13) and (3.14), the next
step consists in deriving the unconditional counterparts to l1i|ai and l2i|ai , which are obtained by
integrating out respectively ai and ai with respect to their normal distribution. Formally,

Evidently, l1 and l2 cannot be derived analytically. Hence, we use Gauss-Hermite quadrature

in mathematical textbooks (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964). The larger M , the more accurate the
approximation.
The trivariate normal density function of the structural form projection errors, a1i , a2i and a3i ,

26 The use of this numerical method is well documented in the econometric literature in the context of panel data
single-equation models (see e.g. Butler and Moﬃtt, 1982; Rabe-Hesketh et al., 2005). However, its use in the context
of panel data models with multiple equations remains to date limited. A few exceptions are Raymond (2007, chapter
3) who studies the performance of the method in two types of dynamic sample selection models, and Raymond et al.
(2010) who apply the method to estimate the persistence of innovation incidence and innovation intensity.

. The FIML estimates of

∗
the structural parameters of the model where y1it
enters the APF are obtained by maximizing

ln l1 subject to the constraints deﬁned in equations (3.7a)-(3.7c).
The evaluation of l2 is done in a similar fashion and yields a similar expression except that the
underlined parameters are replaced by their non-underlined equivalents and that γ1 A1it is replaced
by γ1 y1it . The FIML estimates of the structural parameters of the model where y1it enters the
APF are obtained by maximizing ln l2 without additional constraints.
The performance of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature is worth mentioning. It is known to be
inaccurate if the panel size, Ti , or intraclass correlation, also known as equicorrelation, is large.28
For instance, Rabe-Hesketh et al. (2005) show that, in the context of a random-eﬀect probit,
the quadrature yields biased estimates when Ti = 10 with an equicorrelation of 0.9, or for any
equicorrelation greater than or equal to 0.45 when Ti = 100 (see also Lee, 2000). However,
Raymond (2007, chapter 3) shows that the quadrature works very well in the context of dynamic
sample selection models with a panel of small size (Ti = 4) and equicorrelation between 0.3 and
0.5, the latter range being that of the equicorrelation when these models are estimated on the

Evidently, we would need to carry out Monte Carlo analyses that use our nonlinear dynamic
simultaneous equations models as a benchmark in order to assess the extent of the accuracy of the
quadrature in these models. This is beyond the scope of our analysis and is left for future research.

The likelihood function of this model is similar to l1 except that γ1 A1it is replaced by γ2 A2it where
A2it is deﬁned in equation (3.11a). The FIML estimates of the structural parameters are obtained
by maximizing the log-likelihood subject to the constraints (B.2a)-(B.2c) in lieu of (3.7a)-(3.7c).
Model with observed share of innovative sales
The model with observed share of innovative sales as a predictor of labor productivity consists
of equations (2.1)-(2.4) and (2.5b) with j = 2 in equation (2.5b). The likelihood function of this
model is similar to l1 except that the underlined parameters are replaced by their non-underlined
equivalents and that γ1 A1it is replaced by γ2 y2it . The FIML estimates of the structural parameters
of this model are obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood with no additional constraints.
29 The equicorrelation is about 0.1 when the dynamic sample selection models are estimated on the French innovation survey data. Thus, the poor performance of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature is even less of an issue.

The labor productivity elasticity of the share of innovative sales, denoted by Ely3t ,y2t , is by deﬁnition ∂ ln(y3t )/∂ ln(y2t ) and is derived as

Ely3t ,y2t =

∂ ln(y3t ) ∂ logit(y2t )
∂ logit(y2t )
= γ2
.
∂ logit(y2t ) ∂ ln(y2t )
∂ ln(y2t )

By making the variable change v2t = ln(y2t ) and writing
logit(y2t ) = v2t − ln [1 − ev2t ] ,

(C.2)

we can derive ∂ logit(y2t )/∂ ln(y2t ) as

The elasticity is then written as

γ2
1 − y2t

(C.4)

and is to be evaluated at values of interest (e.g. sample mean) of the share of innovative sales (in
level). When the latent share of innovative sales enters the productivity equation, we evaluate this
elasticity at predicted values of interest of the latent share of innovative sales.
Since Ely3t ,y2t is a linear function of γ2 , the standard error of the estimated elasticity is straightforwardly obtained as

The notion of technological frontier is mostly used in the macroeconomic literature on growth

32

convergence. Among various testable hypotheses one is that innovation becomes more important
as an economy approaches the world technology frontier (see e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2003, 2006). We
can identify in each 3-digit industry the enterprise with the largest productivity and then deﬁne
for each enterprise a technology gap variable as the diﬀerence between the largest productivity
within each 3-digit industry and the productivity of the enterprise belonging to that industry.
Then, looking at the distribution (within each industry) of the technology gap variable, we deﬁne
three dummy variables

DQ

2

,

DQ
3

and

DQ
4

which take the value one if the technology gap lies

respectively between the ﬁrst (>) and second quartile (≤), the second (>) and the third quartile
(≤), and above (>) the third quartile. The dummy variable

DQ ,
1

which takes the value one if the

technology gap lies below or at the ﬁrst quartile, is used as the reference. Firms for which

DQ
1

is equal to one are the closest to the technological frontier. If the above-mentioned hypothesis is
satisﬁed, we expect the eﬀects of

DQ , DQ
2
3

and

DQ
4

to be negative and statistically signiﬁcant.

We consider the lagged values of the dummy variables in the estimation for the same reason as for
the market share regressor. Furthermore, these dummy variables capture not only the distance to
technological frontier but also a type of (indirect) feedback eﬀect of productivity on innovation. As
a result, in order to avoid multicollinearity problems, whenever these dummy variables are included
in the estimation, the above-mentioned feedback eﬀect of productivity is ignored, i.e. we assume
ϑ13 = ϑ23 = 0.
Since the results with the distance to frontier regressors are very similar across model speciﬁcations, we report them only for the model with the innovation propensity as a predictor of labor
productivity (see Table 10). In other words, we still observe a unidirectional causality running
from innovation to productivity with the lagged distance to frontier dummies being insigniﬁcant.
The remaining estimation results can be obtained upon request.
