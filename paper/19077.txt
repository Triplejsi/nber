ABSTRACT
This paper formulates a structural dynamic programming model of preschool investment choices of
altruistic parents and then empirically estimates the structural parameters of the model using the NLSY79
data. The paper finds that preschool investment significantly boosts cognitive and non-cognitive skills,
which enhance earnings and school outcomes. It also finds that a standard Mincer earnings function,
by omitting measures of non-cognitive skills on the right hand side, overestimates the rate of return
to schooling. From the estimated equilibrium Markov process, the paper studies the nature of within
generation earnings distribution and intergenerational earnings and schooling mobility. The paper
finds that a tax financed free preschool program for the children of poor socioeconomic status generates
positive net gains to the society in terms of average earnings and higher intergenerational earnings
and schooling mobility.

Introduction

This paper formulates and estimates an altruistic model of parental preschool investment decisions.
In our model preschool investments affect the cognitive and non-cognitive skills of the children
and hence their lifetime permanent earnings and school outcomes. Optimal choices by parents
determine the equilibrium controlled Markov process, characterizing the equilibrium dynamics
of earnings distributions within each generation, and the schooling and earnings mobility across
generations. We also examine the effect of a social policy that provides free preschool to children of
low socioeconomic status (SES) financed by taxing all parents in the population, on the distribution
of earnings within generation and on intergenerational earnings and schooling mobility. We use
the NLSY79 (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979) and the NLSY79 Children and Young
Adults data containing information on a nationally representative sample of parent-child pairs of
the US population. This paper extends Raut (2003) by incorporating unobserved heterogeneity
and estimating the structural parameters. The paper utilizes the Rust (1987) nested fixed point
maximum likelihood estimation procedure.
Two important building blocks of our model are: (1) The stochastic production processes of
the cognitive and non-cognitive skills with early childhood investment as one of the inputs; (2) An
augmented Mincer earnings function that adds non-cognitive skills to the standard Mincer earnings
function. We estimate these relationships. We provide an estimate of the extent to which the rate
of return to schooling in the standard Mincer earnings function is inflated because the schooling
level in the standard Mincer earnings function embodies the effect of the omitted non-cognitive

skills variables.
In the past three decades, the income gap between the rich and the poor and the wage gap
between the college educated and the non-college educated workers in the US have been widening.
Equalizing education is advocated as the main policy in the US to reduce poverty and income
disparities. Many are, however, highly skeptical about a positive answer to the basic question:
“Can we conquer poverty through school?”
There are many reasons for this skepticism. In the US, education up to high school level
is virtually free. Yet many children of poor SES do not complete high school and many of them
perform poorly in schools. Gaps in test score between the rich and poor children are substantial and
unequal schooling does little to widen this gap (Carneiro and Heckman, 2003; Heckman, 2008).
In spite of its positive effects on test scores and earnings, the effects of improved school quality on
school drop out rates is marginal.
A growing consensus reached among educators, among media writers (see for instance Traub,
2000), among researchers in economics (see for instance Carneiro and Heckman, 2003; Cunha
et al., 2006; Heckman, 2000, 2008) find that children of poor SES are not prepared for college
because they were not prepared for school to begin with. The most effective intervention for the
children of poor SES should be directed at the preschool stage so that these children are prepared
for school and college. The question is then, does preschool experience have long-term positive
effects on school performance and labor market success? This is the main issue that we address
in this paper and corroborates the evidence in Cunha and Heckman (2007, 2009); Heckman et al.
(2010a,b) that early intervention is effective.

There are two types of quantitative studies on this issue. One set of studies use data on high
cost high quality pilot preschool programs such as the High Scope/Perry Preschool Program (see
Heckman et al., 2010a,b) and the North Carolina Abecedarian Study (Campbell et al., 2012). These
studies find a substantial lasting effect of these programs on school performance and labor market
outcomes. The participants in these programs are not representative of the US population.
The other set of studies use data on the Head Start preschool program which is funded by the
Federal government. It is available to the children whose parents earn incomes below poverty
line. Not all eligible children are, however, covered by the program. The quality of the program
is very poor compared to the enriched pilot programs or most private preschool programs. Some
studies find that the Head Start Preschool Program has no long-term effect on children’s cognitive
achievements and school performance, especially for black children. Currie and Thomas (1995)
carry out a careful econometric investigation and conclude that the benefits disappear for black
children because most of the Head Start black children attend low quality public schools. But after
controlling for the school quality, they find significant positive effects of Head Start Preschool
Program. See the recent study by Deming (2009).
These studies are not based on nationally representative samples of children. Most studies
examine only the effect on school performance such as grade retention and high school and college
graduation rates, and do not model parental choice of investing in their children’s preschool. In
this paper, we formulate a model of parental investment in preschool that is guided by economic
incentives. We show that the preschool experience benefits children in acquiring many useful
cognitive and non-cognitive skills, especially for the children of poor SES who live in poor HOME

environments—a measure of family investment. We also show the importance of non-cognitive
skills in improving school performance and life-time earnings of children, after controlling for
their education level, innate ability, and family background. Almlund et al. (2011); Duckworth,
Almlund, Kautz, and Heckman (Duckworth et al.); Heckman and Kautz (2012) summarize the
literature on the effects of noncogntive traits on earnings.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the intergenerational altruism model of parental preschool investment within a structural dynamic programming framework.
Section 3 describes the estimation algorithm that we use. Section 4 provides the empirical specification of the production processes of cognitive and non-cognitive skills and reports the parameter
estimates. Section 5 conducts a policy analysis. Section 6 concludes.

2

The Basic Framework

In this section we formulate an econometrically implementable model of preschool investment of
altruistic parents in a structural dynamic programming framework. We describe how we compute
the long-run equilibrium distributions of earnings and schooling within generation. A transition
probability matrix of earnings or schooling levels provides information about the degree of intergenerational earnings or schooling mobility or if there is intergenerational poverty cycle. We
explain how we compute the mobility index from a transition matrix and how we compute the
long-run equilibrium tax rate to finance the free preschool to the children of poor SES and its netgain or loss to the society in terms of welfare gains and loses of various groups, and in terms of

7

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

change in the per capita disposable (i.e., after tax) earnings in the long-run equilibrium.
We assume a parthenogenetic mode of biological reproduction in our model and with due
respect to both genders, all individuals are male gender. Parents of period t will be referred to as
generation t. Each parent has one child. After parents of generation t die at the end of period t,
their children become the parents of generation t + 1 and make decisions for their children and the
economy goes on in this recursive manner for ever.
In each period, parents are characterized by a vector of observed characteristics x, and a vector
of unobserved characteristics ε, which are described in detail below. We summarize these traits by
a vector z = ( x, ε). When we need to be specific about his generation t or period t, we write him
as zt = ( xt , ε t ). We assume that each component of x takes finite number of values, thus x will be
from a finite set X with m elements. We assume that the set X is ordered with elements x1 , ...., xm
in it. For a parent-child pair, if v is a variable that refers to the parent, we use v′ to denote the
corresponding variable for his child.
An individual’s life time consists of several stages during which important life-cycle events
relevant to learning and earning occur. A parent invest in his child’s preschool activities during ages
[0-5), which help develop his child’s school readiness, and various cognitive and non-cognitive
skills. Denote by a the preschool investment choice of a parent. At the end of the preschool period,
the child acquires levels of innate ability or cognitive skill τ, social skill σ, motivational skill µ,
self-esteem skill η, and internal self-control skill ϕ.
During ages [5-17), the child goes to school. The school performance at this stage depends on
his level of τ, σ, µ, η, and ϕ that the child has acquired during the previous stage. It also depends
8

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

on the quality of the school that he attends1 , the quality of the neighborhood, and the parental
home inputs such as how many hours of time the parent spend with the child to do his homework,
how many hours the child watches TV and the type of programs he watches, and how stable and
stimulating the relationships among the family members are. Many of these are choice variables
for the parent. We do not have adequate information about these factors in our dataset, so we do
not analyze them.2
During ages [17-26), the child decides the number of years of schooling to complete, which
depends on his parent’s family background, his own cognitive and non-cognitive abilities τ, σ, µ,
η, and ϕ, and some random shocks ε s . We take this decision to be exogenously given, and denote
its dependence on these factors by the function s = s(τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, ε s ).
During ages [26-], he works, forms his family, procreate one child and chooses a preschool
investment plan for his child. In section 4.1, we describe in detail the components of the observed
characteristics vector x = (τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s). In this section, we sequentially define below the components of the vector of his unobservable characteristics ε.
The production sector of the economy uses a linear production function with labor in efficiency unit as the only input.

An individual with observed cognitive and non-cognitive skills

x = (τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s) is assumed to be equivalent to the unit of labor in efficiency unit w ( x ) + ε 1 ,
where ε 1 given x is a mean-zero random productivity shock or it can be interpreted as mean-zero
1 Even

differences in school qualities and parental choices of school quality in an altruistic dynamic programming
framework can limit social mobility and lead to the intergenerational poverty trap, see Nishimura and Raut (2007) for
such a model.
2 However, see the studies by Cunha et al. (2010) and Cunha and Heckman (2008), as well as Mohanty and Raut
(2009) and Boca et al. (2013).

measurement error. The individual and the firm observe ε 1 but it is unobserved by others. Let
π ( x ) be the probability density function on the set of observable characteristics X in that period
and g1 (dε 1 ) be the probability density3 of the random shock ε 1 given x. The aggregate output,
which turns out to be also the per capita income or the average income of the economy in any
period is

An individual with skills x and productivity shock ε 1 ends up with the marginal product w =
w ( x ) + ε 1 in the labor market. This w is his annualized permanent earnings out of which he
chooses a preschool investment plan a for his child. The annual cost of his investment plan a is
θ̃ ( a) ≡ θ ( a) + ε 2 ( a), where θ is a constant for all parents and ε 2 is an unobserved parent specific
variation in the cost, assumed to have zero mean. The rest of his earnings makes up his annualized
permanent consumption c ≡ w − θ̃ ( a) = w ( x ) − θ ( a) + ε ( a), where ε ( a) ≡ ε 1 − ε 2 ( a) . We
assume that the parents with observed characteristics x have a finite number of feasible preschool
choices which is represented by the ordered set A ( x ) . The utility or reward of a parent ( x , ε)
from a preschool investment choice a ∈ A ( x ) has the form u ( x, ε, a) = u ( x, a) + ε ( a) where
u ( x, a) ≡ w( x ) − θ ( a). In the rest of the exposition we assume general form for u ( x, a).
Finally, we define the components of the unobserved heterogeneity vector ε of an individual of
use the convention of denoting the probability density g of a continuous random variable ε by the notation
g (dε) and for a discrete random variable x by g ( x ) and for their joint density as g ( x, dε) .
4 In a similar theoretical model, Raut (1995) includes an external total factor productivity multiplier that increases
with an increase in the number of skilled workers in the economy. The paper showed that policies that lead to higher
social mobility also leads to higher economic growth.

observed characteristics x as ε = (ε ( a) , a ∈ A ( x )), where ε ( a) is defined above. Denote by E
the set of all possible ε.
In any period for a parent z = ( x, ε) with a preschool investment choice a, his child’s vector
of cognitive and non-cognitive skills and unobserved heterogeneity shocks, i.e., the vector z′ =

( x ′ , ε′ ), is produced stochastically, which is characterized by the transition probability density
function p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a) .
The preschool investment choice problem of the parent ( x ε) is given by the following Bellman
equation:
V ( x, ε) = max u ( x, ε, a) + β

where V ( x, ε) is his maximized welfare, i.e. the value function, u(.) is the utility he derives from
his own consumption; the utility he derives from his child’s welfare is the expected maximized
welfare V ( x ′ , ε′ ) of the child, discounted by β, the degree of parental altruism towards the child.
His influence over his child’s wellbeing is through his preschool investment choice a, which affects
his child’s cognitive and non-cognitive skill formations as reflected in the transition probability
density function p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a) . Under general regularity conditions on u(.), p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a)
and β, the measurable value function V ( x, ε) and measurable optimal decision rule a ( x, ε) exist
(see, for instance, Bhattacharya and Majumdar (1989), Theorem 3.2).
An equilibrium in our model is a controlled Markov process with a given initial distribution
of parent population µ0 ( x, dε) on X × E in period t = 0, a family of optimal preschool investment decisions a ( x, ε) , x ∈ X and ε ∈ E and the stationary transition probability density function

11

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a ( x, ε)) . These variables determine the equilibrium dynamics of the earnings distribution and the degree of intergenerational earnings and college mobilities, and how these are
affected by a public policy as described below.
This level of generality makes the estimation of the model computationally intractable. We are
more interested in studying the equilibrium dynamics over the observable states X . Since X is
finite the equilibrium dynamics over it is a Markov chain, determined by the initial distribution π0
of population over X , and the transition probability matrix Π = [Π ( x, x ′ )] x,x′ ∈X . We derive π0 ,
and Π from the above equilibrium controlled Markov process, µ0 , a, and p (.|.). A stationary or
long-run equilibrium in this reduced set-up is a probability density function π over the observable
states X such that π = πΠ, i.e., an invariant distribution π of the transition probability matrix Π.
Given π0 and Π, we can examine how the population distribution πt on X changes over time t.
The structure of Π can tell us if there exists a unique invariant distribution, and whether the equilibrium population distribution πt over time t converges to the invariant distribution as t becomes
large. A sufficient condition for both is that Π ( x, x ′ ) > 0 for all x, x ′ ∈ X . If the equilibrium
transition matrix of Π exhibits a block-diagonal structure (after reordering of the states in X if
necessary), then the economy would exhibit an intergenerational poverty cycle. However, our empirical estimates of Π have all elements strictly positive. Hence we do not have intergenerational
poverty cycles. The unique invariant distribution is the long-run equilibrium distribution that the
economy will converge to starting at any initial distribution π0 .
A number of mobility measures have been proposed in the literature for the Markov process
determined by a transition matrix. Sommers and Conlisk (1979) argues that 1 − λmax is the most
12

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

appropriate measure of social mobility, where λmax is the second highest positive eigenvalue of the
transition probability matrix (it is well-known that the highest positive eigenvalue of a transition
probability matrix is always 1). We use this measure for earnings or college mobility, and use
the Gini coefficient of average earnings over the observable states (i.e., the Gini coefficients of
earnings distribution (w ( x ) , π ( x ) , x ∈ X ) to compare the effects of our public preschool policy.
Public preschool policy: We consider the effect of introducing a publicly provided free preschool
to children of poor SES financed by taxing all parents. In any period, we define parents of observable state x to fall in the poor SES category if w ( x ) ≤ 0.7w̄ where the average or per capita earnings w̄ = ∑ w ( x ) π ( x ) . Denote by X p the set of observable characteristics of the parents of poor
SES. The equilibrium tax rate τ is then given by τ = θ ∑ x∈X p w ( x ) π ( x ) / ∑ x∈X w ( x ) π ( x ) .
Once such a policy is introduced, a new set of optimal preschool investment decision rules and
a new transition matrix will emerge, affecting the invariant distribution, degree of earnings and
schooling inequalities within generation, and the degree of social and college mobilities between
generations. We estimate these effects empirically.

2.1 The Econometric Methodology
We follow the Rust (1987, 1994) approach to estimation of dynamic discrete choice model. He
introduced the following three assumptions to convert the choice problem in Equation (2) into a
random utility model.

Assumption 1 For u ( x, ε, a) = u ( x, a) + ε ( a), the support of ε ( a) is the real line for all a ∈

13

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

A (x) .
Assumption 2 The transition probability p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a) = f ( x ′ | x, a) g (dε′ | x ′ ) for some
twice continuously differentiable density function g with finite first moment.

Assumption 3 The components of ε are independently and identically distributed as extreme
value distribution with location parameter 0 and scale parameter 1.

Let Ω ( x, a) = {ε|for individual ( x, ε) , the choice a is optimal}. The conditional choice probabilities are defined as P ( a| x ) =

∫
Ω( x,a)

g (dε| x ) . Denote the vector of conditional choice prob-

abilities by P = { P ( a| x ) , a ∈ A ( x ) , x ∈ X }. Let ∆ be the set of all possible vectors of conditional probabilities. Under the above assumptions, it is easy to see that the transition probability
matrix Π and the average welfare of individuals in observable characteristics group can be computed with the conditional choice probabilities only. Furthermore, the computation of the conditional choice probabilities becomes a simpler iterative fixed point computation of a map Ψ on the
finite dimensional compact set ∆ as given below.

εg (dε), and F ( x, a) =

[ f ( x1 | x, a) , . . . , f ( xm | x, a)], a m dimensional row vector.
Under Assumption 1 and 2, Rust (1987) showed that the problem in Equation (2) becomes a
random utility model. Using the McFadden result that a random utility model under Assumption 3
has a Logit representation, Rust showed that the conditional choice probabilities has the following
Logit representation,

P ( a| x ) =

eṽ(x,a)
′ , where
∑ a′ ∈ A( x) eṽ( x,a )

are m dimensional column vectors with elements ū ( x ) = ∑ a∈ A( x) u ( x, a) P ( a| x ) and ē ( x ) =
∑ a∈ A( x) e ( x, a) P ( a| x ), x ∈ X .
The question is, given our data how do we estimate the structural parameters, and hence choose
a particular model to study all the policy issues? We explain this in the next section.

3

Econometric implementation

For each vector of structural parameters, we need compute the optimal choice probabilities P =

{ P ( a| x ) , a ∈ A ( x ) , x ∈ X }and use them to compute the likelihood of the sample and the maxi-

15

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

mum likelihood estimates of the structural parameters. To that end, Rust (1987) used a fixed point
algorithm on the set of functions to compute the value function, and used the value function to compute the optimal choice probabilities. Hotz and Miller (1993) use the fixed point algorithm for the
choice probabilities and used these choice probabilities to compute the value function. For other
estimation procedures, see a recent survey of the literature by Aguirregabiria and Mira (2010). We
follow the Hotz and Miller approach to estimate the structural parameters as outlined below.
Based on what is known in the child-development literature, we specify the stochastic production functions for cognitive and non-cognitive skills as follows:

(
)
(
)
(
)
f γ x ′ | x, a = qτ τ ′ |τ, s, a × qσ σ′ |τ ′ , τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, a

)
(
)
×qµ µ′ |τ ′ , τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, a × qη η ′ |τ ′ , τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, a

)
(
)
×q φ φ′ |τ ′ , τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, a × qs s′ |τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , η ′ , ϕ′ , s, a

(6)

where each component probability density function is further specified as a Logit model with the
regressors as the conditioning variables of the component. The details of the production process
are discussed in section 4.4. Denote by γ the vector of all of these regression parameters, which
together determine the transition probabilities f γ ( x ′ | x, a). Denote the parameters of the reward
function, θ and the altruism parameter β by the vector ξ = (θ, β) .
(
)
We have data of the type xi , ai , xi′ , i = 1, ..., n, on n parent-child pairs. The problem is to
estimate the structural parameters ζ = (ξ, γ) using this data.
Note that for fixed ζ, Equation (5), defines a map Ψ : ∆→∆ since the right hand side of the
16

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

equation is a function of conditional probabilities. The fixed point of which is the set of conditional
choice probabilities of the dynamic programming problem in Equation (2). It can be shown that
for each structural parameter ζ, the iterative process Pn = Ψ (Pn−1 ), starting from any initial P0 ,
(
)
always converges to a unique fixed point Pζ = Pζ ( a| x ) , a ∈ A ( x ) , x ∈ X . We use this Pζ to
calculate the log-likelihood of the sample in the following procedure.
First note that Pr ( a, x ′ | x ) = Pr ( a| x ) . Pr ( x ′ | x, a) = Pζ ( a| x ) . f γ ( x ′ | x, a). The log-likelihood
function for the sample is then given by L (ξ, γ) = L1 (ξ, γ) + L2 (γ), where L1 (ξ, γ) =
(
)
∑in=1 ln Pζ ( ai | xi ) and L2 (γ) = ∑in=1 ln f γ xi′ | xi , ai . The full information maximum likelihood
estimation involves maximizing the full likelihood L (ξ, γ). The maximization of the full information likelihood involves numerous parameters. The maximization algorithm does not always
converge and this turned out to be true in our case.
We follow a two-stage procedure instead. In the first stage we compute a consistent estimate γ̂
by maximizing the conditional likelihood L2 (γ), which given the recursive structure in Equation
(5), is equivalent to estimating the individual logit models constituting the parts of f γ ( x ′ | x, a). We
then estimate ξ by maximizing L1 (ξ, γ̂) .
(
)
Denote this two stage estimate by ξ̂ r , γ̂r and the full information maximum likelihood esti)
(
mate by ξ̂ f , γ̂ f . How close is the estimate ξ̂ r to ξ̂ f ? How precise is the estimate of the standard
error Σξξ ·γ of ξ̂ r obtained from the restricted maximum likelihood procedure by fixing a value of

Since our γ̂r is a consistent estimator for γ, from the first line of Equation (7) we know that

implement the above estimation procedure and for all other computational tasks.

Empirical Findings

4.1

The Dataset and the Variables

We use the NLSY79 and the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults data. The NLSY79 dataset
contains a nationally representative sample of 12,686 young men and women who were 14-22
years old when they were first surveyed in 1979, i.e., these sampled individuals represent a population born in the 1950s and 1960s, and living in the United States in 1979. These individuals
are interviewed annually. The dataset has records of school and labor market experiences of these
individuals and also the information on their cognitive and non-cognitive traits. We, however, need
information on most of these variables for the parents of the respondents. This dataset does not
have much information on respondents’ parents. So we link this dataset with the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults dataset. The child survey dataset includes longitudinal assessments of each
child’s cognitive, attitudinal and social, motivational, academic and labor market experiences. We
construct the variables of our study as follows:
Early childhood inputs and home environment: We take the father’s and mother’s education
levels to measure the child’s family background. The NLSY dataset has poor measures of respondent’s early childhood inputs. It has only a binary variable containing information on whether
the respondent had preschool (which does not include Head Start) experience or not. We treat
individuals with Head Start as having no preschool in our analysis. Notice that this may lead to
underestimation of the effect of preschool investment. We use the revised AFQT score to measure
innate ability.

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

Socialization skill (σ): Each respondent was asked how social towards others he/she felt at age
6, expressed in the scale of 1 to 4, the highest number represents most social. We create a binary
sociability variable by assigning the value 1 if a respondent reported a value of 3 or 4 and assigning
0 otherwise.
Motivational skill (µ): We measure motivational skill as the job aspiration of the respondents
in the main NLSY79 sample. For the children sample, we have taken the average of the various
motivation measures at young ages of the child and assigned a value 1 if it the average is larger
than 3.75 and 0 otherwise.
Rosenberg measure of self-esteem skill (η): It measures the positiveness with which individuals regard themselves in society, i.e., a positive sense of self. Six questions were taken from the
classic Rosenberg (1965) scale in the NLSY surveys. There is, however, no well accepted definition of adequate self-esteem. Based on the distribution, we divided the 25-point scale by treating
a score of 20 or greater to indicate a high self-esteem, assigning a value 1 to η and a value 0 to η
otherwise.
Pearlin mastery scale of internal self-concept (ϕ): This measures the extent to which an
individual believes that his life chances are under his own control (Pearlin et al., 1981). This is
similar to Rotter scale of self-control. The respondents were asked seven questions yielding scores
ranging from 0 to 28. We assign the value 1 representing a high sense of self-control to respondents
with a score between 23 and 28 inclusive, otherwise we assign a a value 0. For further discussion
of these measures see Duckworth, Almlund, Kautz, and Heckman (Duckworth et al.).

4.2 An Augmented Earnings Function - The Role of cognitive and noncognitive skills
Noncognitive traits are important determinants of both earnings and learning. For surveys of the
effect of noncognitive traits on earnings see Borghans et al. (2008) and Almlund et al. (2011).
We carry out a rudimentary analysis in this section to emphasize the importane of these traits
for earnings. We estimate an augmented Mincer earnings function by adding measures of noncognitive skills such as social, motivational, self-esteem and internal self-concept skills in the
standard Mincer earnings function that includes only cognitive skills such as innate ability and
the number of years of schooling. As a byproduct, we provide an estimate of how much of the
rate of returns to education in the standard Mincer earnings function is over estimated because
the schooling level which is correlated with the omitted non-cognitive skill variables captures the
effects of the non-cognitive skills.
Mincer (1958) showed that if foregone earnings is the only cost of schooling, and the effect
of an extra year of schooling on earnings is proportional and constant, then the log of earnings is
a linear function of the number of years of schooling. He later extended this model by allowing
experience (measured by the square of the age of the worker) to affect earnings over the life-cycle
as follows:
ln w = α0 + α1 s + α2 age + α3 age2 + ε

This basic Mincer earnings function has been estimated using various datasets. It has been
given various interpretations by deriving it from various models of schooling choice, see for in21

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

stance Card (1999); Heckman et al. (2006, 2008); Weiss (1995). We estimate the basic model
taking w to be the annual earnings of the respondents in the NLSY79 dataset. The estimates for
this basic model are reported in the second column (with the heading ”Basic”) in Table 1. Our
estimate for α1 is 11.12 percent which is close to what is found in other studies, see for instance
the survey by Card (1999), and the analyses of Heckman et al. (2006, 2008)
What exactly is the role of education in the production of earnings? Does an extra year of
education have any intrinsic value in the production of output? Or is it a surrogate for other factors
such as innate ability and hence the estimated returns to education is higher than its actual worth
in production?5
We include the AFQT score variable as a regressor, which is a widely used measure of ability,
together with other standard variables used in the literature such as family background measured
by the parents’ education levels, and a dummy variable for the female gender. These are reported
in the third column (with the heading of ”Extended”) in Table 1. The estimate for the schooling
coefficient drops to 6.94 percent. This estimate is corrected for ability bias or gender bias in the
estimated returns to schooling and close to what is found in other studies, see Card (1999). We
now add to it our four measures of non-cognitive skills to see how much of the above estimate
of the returns to education is biased upward because it is capturing the effects of the omitted
non-cognitive skills. The estimates are shown in the fourth column of Table 1 (with the heading
”Augmented”). We see that all of the four non-cognitive skill variables have significant positive
effects on earnings and the rate of returns to education has dropped by about 1 percent point. By

Borghans et al. (2011); Heckman and Kautz (2012) for limitations of this measure.

22

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

looking at the R2 values, we see that about 1 percent variation in earnings is explained by the
inclusion of the non-cognitive skills in the standard Mincer earnings function.

4.3

Estimation of Schooling Function

We consider two specifications of the schooling function, s (τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , η ′ , ϕ′ , a, ε′ ). In the first specification, we assume that the schooling level is a continuous variable and the function s (τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , η ′ , ϕ′ , a, ε′ )
is linear. We assume that the variable ε′ constitutes an additive error term and satisfies all the assumptions of the OLS model.6 We included our measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills
and the family background. The parameter estimates from this model are shown in table 2.
In our second specification, we consider only two levels of schooling: s = 1 for completed
college or more, and s = 0 otherwise. We assume that s (τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , η ′ , ϕ′ , a, ε′ ) is a Logit model.
The parameter estimates from this model are shown in table 2.
It is clear from the estimates that the most significant determinant of schooling is the innate
ability measured by AFQT score. Moreover, even after controlling for the family background, we
find that all non-cognitive skills have significant positive effects on schooling level.

4.4

Production of non-cognitive skills

As established in the cited literature, non-cognitive skills are important determinants of earnings
and learning. In this section we estimate the production process of these skills and estimate the

effect of preschool experience on the production of these non-cognitive skills.
The literature in sociology, psychology, early childhood development and physiology suggest
that early childhood investment is the most crucial input for development of cognitive and noncognitive skills. (See Cunha and Heckman, 2007, 2009; Heckman et al., 2008)
We create the binary variable τ assigning the value 1 to denote an individual as highly talented
if the AFQT score of the individual is 70 or higher (in a scale of 0 to 100), and assigning the
value τ = 0 otherwise. Other binary skill variables are described earlier. We estimated the Logit
models for each of the cognitive and non-cognitive skills types on the children sample. These parameter estimates constitute the components of the parameter vector γ of the transition probability
function f γ ( x ′ | x, a) . We report the parameter estimates in table 3 for the specifications of each
components of x and a. These are used in the two-step estimation procedure to estimate ξ = (θ, β)
given the parameters γ of the transition probability function fixed at these estimates. To compare
the sensitivity of our estimates and inference of the structural parameters, we estimated another
specification in which we included only those regressors that are significant.
From table 3, it is clear that after controlling for parents’ grade, preschool has significantly
positive effect on the socialization skill, and on the levels of talent and schooling. But it has no
effect on Pearlin measure of internal self-concept and the Rosenberg measure of self-esteem. The
estimates in the table also show that the level of talent has strong positive effects on the formation
of all skills.

Optimal Parental Preschool Investment Decision

We assume that the state variables s, τ, σ, µ, η and ϕ are all binary, the components of the random
variable ε are continuous and the preschool investment choice a is a binary variable, taking value 1
if the parent decides to invest in preschool and taking value 0 otherwise. For many children in our
sample, we have two parents alive, but in our model we have assumed one parent family.
We use both parents’ information to create a synthetic parent as follows: We construct a parent’s binary schooling variable s to take value 1 if either parent has 16 or more years of education,
otherwise s = 0.
We define a parent to fall in the poor SES if his earnings is less than 70 percent of the average
earnings in economy. We consider a public policy of providing preschool to children of poor
socioeconomic status (SES) in all periods. This will impose a tax burden on all parents, but such
policy may also improve the social mobility, reduce the earnings inequality and eventually lead
to a higher level of per capita earnings in the long-run. We examine if the gain from per capita
earnings can outpace the cost of providing such a social insurance program. We also look at its
within generation effects on earnings, and on the intergenerational effects on earnings and college
mobility.
The two-step maximum likelihood estimates of the structural parameters ξ = (θ, β) are shown
in table 4 for two sets of specifications of the transition probabilities f γ ( x ′ | x, a) - the first column
contains the estimates from the specification in which only the significant conditioning variables
are included, and the second column contains the estimates of the parameters in which all the

28

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

conditioning variables are included. The table also reports the percent of parents falling into the
poor SES status in the long-run before and after the introduction of the public policy and the tax
rate τ that finances the public preschool policy in the long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, the table
also reports the long-run disposable (i.e., after tax) average yearly earnings of workers before and
after the introduction of the social contract policy.
An estimate of θ̂ = 1.224 in the table means that the cost per year during the first five preschool
years is $6, 120. This comes from the fact we have annualized earnings over 25 years of life-cycle
and a total preschool cost of $30, 600 = $1, 224 × 25 is spread out uniformly over the first five
years of the child’s preschool age. Schweinhart et al. reported an estimate of the average yearly
preschool cost to be $6, 178 using the actual preschool cost. Our maximum likelihood estimate of
the cost is very close to their direct estimate of cost.

Economic Benefits from Public Provision of Preschool

We have shown that investment in preschool enhances certain skills that are important for learning and earning. We have also seen that very few parents of poor SES invest in their children’s
preschool. If preschool is publicly provided for the children of poor SES, it will have many economic benefits: It will increase social mobility, it will reduce income inequality, it will improve
college enrollment rate, it will improve the community or criminal behavior, and it will also bring
higher tax revenues because more workers will be earning higher wages. It is important to note
that the magnitude of the effect of publicly provided preschool will depend on if the social protection will be available to all future generations or it is just a one time policy. (See Heckman and
Masterov, 2004)
While looking at the magnitudes of the estimated economic benefits below, it is important to
keep in mind that the effects that we report in this paper are underestimates for many reasons: First,
we have treated the Head Start children same as children without preschool. Second, the preschool
programs that the respondents attended were the ones that existed during the sixties. The quality of
preschool programs since then has improved significantly and thus the effects of current preschool
programs will be much higher than the estimates that we have.

5.1

Intergenerational Earnings Mobility

To examine how the introduction of the public policy that provides free preschool to children of
poor SES, affect earnings mobility between generations, we computed the mobility index of the

30

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

stationary transition probability matrix of the equilibrium Markov process of earnings distributions
over time. Our estimate of the measure of earnings mobility before the introduction of the social
contract is 0.5945 and after the introduction of the public preschool program is 0.6468.
It is difficult to compare our estimate of the mobility index with previous studies because there
is no commonly agreed upon measure of earnings mobility. For a survey of various measures of
mobilities and their properties, see Geweke et al. (1986).

5.2

College Mobility

[ ]
Denote by Qs = qij , i, j = 1, 2, the intergenerational college mobility matrix in which state 1
represents no college and state 2 represents college or more. The element qij represents the probability that a child of a parent of college education status i will move to the college education status
j, for all i and j = 1, 2. We report below the estimated college mobility matrices, the corresponding
invariant distributions, and the estimates of the mobility measure before and after the introduction
of the social contract. These estimates indicate that the introduction of the social contract will
increase college enrollment from a 6.71 percent to a 9.45 percent, i.e. a 2.73 percentage point
increase for a child of non-college parent. And the percentage of college educated population will
increase in the long-run from the rate of 10.16 percent without social contract to a higher rate of
13.76 percent with the social contract. That is, there will be about a 3.6% increase in the college
enrollment in the long-run.

Lifetime Earnings Inequality

Preschool investment would increase the incomes of the children of poor SES families and thus it
will reduce the income gap between the rich and the poor. Using the Gini-coefficient to measure
income inequality, we would expect that over time income inequality will improve. The longrun income distribution that one observes is the invariant distribution. We compute the Ginicoefficient of income inequality for the invariant income distribution before the introduction of the
public policy and compare it with the Gini-coefficient for the invariant income distribution after
the introduction of the policy. The estimated Gini-coefficients are respectively 0.2363 without the
social contract, and 0.2335 with the social contract. The estimated Gini-coefficient of average
lifetime earnings is 0.2363. We note that the social contract of publicly providing preschool to
children of poor SES produces a reduction in the inequality of the long-term earnings.

32

Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool

May 15, 2013 7:52pm

To compare our estimates to the literature, it is important to know that earnings in our model
are averages over the life-cycle (it is 25 years in our data). Furthermore, we have earnings averaged
over 64 income groups, whereas most studies in the literature have many more groups. The Gini
coefficient decreases if it is applied to average earnings of groups. Keeping this in mind, our
estimates are comparable to estimates in the literature. For instance, Leigh (2009) estimates the
Gini coefficient of ten years average earnings over the life cycle to be little less than 0.3 in the
1990’s and around 0.35 for annual earnings in the 1990s.

5.4 The Tax Burden of the Social Policy
Suppose the government provides preschool to the children of poor SES perpetually. We know that
the size of the population of poor SES will become smaller over time. Thus the resource needs of
the program will become smaller, and the tax revenues will become higher over time. We can look
at the stream of these costs and benefits to the society and then compute the average per period costs
and benefits to calculate the tax-burdens of the social contract. Applying the Ergodic theorem, this
boils down to computing the costs and benefits of the invariant distribution that will result after the
introduction of the social contract. Our computations below are based on the long-run equilibrium.
Without the public policy, approximately 35.71 percent of the population in the long-run will
fall in the poor socioeconomic status, using our definition of poor SES. The introduction of the
public policy will reduce the population in the poor SES to 29.14 percent. From table 5, we see
that while the welfare of the income groups that get publicly provided preschool will be higher,
the welfare of the rest of the population will be lower. It is difficult to estimate the net effect of

the policy on social welfare since there is no universally agreed upon aggregation rule for social
welfare. We use the average yearly disposable earnings over the life-cycle to compare the net gain
or loss to the society. These estimates in table 4 show that the average yearly disposable earnings
of the society in the long-run is higher by $113 after the introduction of the policy. Based on this
we conclude that there is a net gain to the society of introducing such a publicly provided preschool
program for the children of poor SES.
Our benefit calculation does not take into account other public savings that will result due to
the policy such as savings from welfare assistance programs and savings to the criminal justice
system and potential victims of crimes. If we incorporate these, the returns will be much higher.
Using data from the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program, Heckman et al. (2010b) estimate a total
benefit of 7 percent from all these sources for each dollar spent on the preschool program even
counting for the social costs of taxation.

Conclusion

This paper formulates an altruistic model of preschool investment choices of parents in a structural
dynamic programming framework. It uses the NLSY79 and NLSY79 Children and Young Adult
data to estimate the structural parameters
The paper estimates the production processes of two types of cognitive skills - the IQ score and
the schooling level, and four types of non-cognitive skills - the socialization skill, the motivational
skill, the Rosenberg measure of self-esteem skill and the Pearlin mastery scale of internal self-

concept skill. The paper finds that the preschool boosts significantly both types of cognitive skills
and only the socialization skills among the four measures of non-cognitive skills. Moreover, all
these cognitive and non-cognitive skills have significant positive effects on the level of schooling
and the labor market earnings of individuals.
The paper estimates the structural parameters and then used those to carry out a Marschak
(1953)-Lucas (1976)-Critique free policy analysis to examine the effect of a publicly provided
preschool to economically disadvantaged children and financing it by taxing all parents. Taking
into account the within generation and between generations effects of such a policy, the paper finds
that introduction of such a public policy (a) improves the intergenerational earnings mobility from
0.5945 to 0.6468, measured in a scale of 0 to 1, (b) improves the college mobility from 0.6609
to 0.6863, measured in a scale of 0 to 1, (c) increases the college completion rate of the children
of non-college educated parents from 10.16 percent to 13.76 percent, i.e., a 3.6 percentage point
increase, (d) reduces the within generation earnings inequality measured by the Gini coefficient in
a scale of 0 to 1 from 0.2363 to 0.2335, and (e) there is a net gain (net of taxes) in the long-run per
capita earnings.
The positive effects of the public preschool policy will be even higher in reality because we
have used the estimated benefits from the lower quality preschool programs that existed in the
1970s.
