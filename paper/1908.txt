Residual Risk Revisited

ABSTRACT

The Capital Asset Pricing Model in conjunction with the
usual market model assumptions implies that well-diversified
portfolios should be mean variance efficient and, hence, betas
computed with respect to such indices should completely explain
expected returns on individual assets. In fact, there is now
a large body of evidence indicating that the market proxies
usually employed in empirical tests are not mean variance efficient.
Moreover, there is considerable evidence suggesting that these
rejections are in part a consequence of the presence of omitted
risk factors which are associated with nonzero risk premia in the
residuals from the single index market model. Consequently, the
idiosyncratic variances from the one factor model should partially
reflect exposure to these omitted sources of systematic risk and,
hence, should help explain expected returns. There are two
plausible explanations for the inability to obtain statistically
reliable estimates of a linear residual risk effect in the
previous literature:
(1) nonlinearity of the residual risk
effect and (2) the inadequacy of the statistical procedures
employed to measure it.
The results presented below indicate that the econometric
methods employed previously are the culprits. Pronounced residual
risk effects are found in the whole fifty-four year sample
and in numerous five year subperiods as well when weighted least
squares estimation is coupled with the appropriate corrections
for sampling error in the betas and residual variances of
individual security returns. In addition, the evidence suggests
that it is important to take account of the nonnormality
and heteroskedasticity of security returns when making the
appropriate measurement error corrections in cross—sectional
regressions. Finally, the results are sensitive to the
specification of the model for expected returns.

Introduction

The central feature of modern asset pricing theory is the distinction
between systematic and diversifiable risk.

As a consequence, it is hardly

surprising that the notion that expected returns depend on total variance and
not merely on exposure to systematic risk has proved to a ubiquitous choice as

a maintained alternative hypothesis in empirical tests.' What is surprising

is the outcome of such tests:

there has been no statistically reliable

rejection of any modern asset pricing theory in favor of the hypothesis that
expected returns depend on total risk.

There is an interesting puzzle implicit in this observation. There is
now a large body of evidence indicating that both the equally weighted and

value weighted CRSP indices are not mean variance efficient and that this

finding is due to some extent to omitted risk factors.2

Yet this is

inconsistent with the generally insignificant measured residual risk effects
found in the literature——by this logic, measured residual variances should in

part reflect the squared factor loadings of omitted risk factors and, hence,
should be associated with significant risk premia in large samples.3 The

'Moreover, diversifiable risk may affect equilibrium asset prices
even when the notion of systematic risk is meaningful if all
investors face substantive transactions costs. See Levy (1978)

LSee, for example, Lehmann and Modest (1985) and the papers cited
therein. Note that this finding could occur when the static
Capital Asset Pricing Model is true but the market portfolio is
unobservable and the usual CRSP indices are inadequate
substitutes. It is also consistent with the implications of
multifactor asset pricing theories along the lines of Merton
(1973), Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985), and Ross (1976, 1977) in
heir equilibrium and approximate arbitrage incarnations.
'Note that this need not occur. In general, if there is a 'single
omitted risk factor and the average factor loading of individual
securities was zero while their values were symmetrically
distributed across securities, the residual risk premium would be
zero. This possibility would not appear to be empirically
relevant given the evidence presented in Lehmann and Modest
(1985) regarding own variance effects.

—2--

notion that expected returns depend on residual risk as well as systematic
risk should be a powerful maintained alternative hypothesis in tests of asset
pricing theories. It has not proved to be one.
In fact, the total risk hypothesis has instead provided a consistent foil
for investigators interested in making points about the statistical properties

of such tests.

In early work, Douglas (1968) and Linter (1965) found that

average security returns were significantly related to estimates of both
individual security betas (computed with respect to an equally weighted index)

and total or residual variances, apparently rejecting the mean variance
efficiency of the equally weighted index.

The justly celebrated Miller and

Scholes (1972) investigation documented an important statistical problem with
these results: individual security returns are marked by significant positive

skewness so that firms with high average returns will typically have large
measured total or residual variances as well.

Such measurement error correlations suggest that considerable caution
should be exercised when using total or residual variance as an explanatory
variable. The need for such caution was substantiated in practice by Fama and

MacBeth (1973) who found no residual risk effect when residual variances and

betas were estimated in an earlier period to mitigate the Miller—Scholes
problem. Similar results were obtained by Roll and Ross (1980) in their tests
of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory. Total risk added to the explanatory power of

factor loadings, which measure putative exposure to systematic risk, in
accounting for mean returns when the relevant sample moments were measured
from the same returns but failed to make a significant addition when different
observations were used to estimate mean returns, factor loadings, and total

—3—

variances.

These results have been interpreted differently in other comparisons of

the explanatory power of total and systematic risk measures.

Friend,

Westerfield, and Granito (1978) and Friend and Westerfield (1981) found that
both measured betas and residual variances (computed with respect to a variety

of indices) typically proved to have insignificant effects in cross—sectional

regressions constructed to avoid the Miller—Scholes problem.4

Similarly,

Dhrymes, Friend, and Gultekin (1984) and Dhrymes, Friend, Gultekin, and
Gultekin (1984) found that both factor loadings and residual variances yielded

insignificant estimates of risk premia in an Arbitrage Pricing context. Taken

at face value,

these results indicate that neither systematic nor

diversifiable risk measures adequately explain average equity returns which

perhaps suggests that no reliable risk/return tradeoff is implicit in mean
returns.

An alternative interpretation is

that there is another serious

statistical problem associated with tests involving both systematic and

4Friend and Westerfield (1981) performed regressions relating
individual and grouped security returns to both contemporaneously
estimated betas and residual variances and standard deviations
and those estimated in previous periods. The regressions which
employed contemporaneous estimates often yielded significant
residual risk effects which of course can be ascribed to the
skewness effects discussed above. With one exception, no
significant measured residual risk effects were found when beta
and residual variance estimates were computed in a previous
period. The exception occurred when separate regressions were
estimated for months when the return on their market proxy
exceeded the riskiess rate and for those in which the reverse was
true. As Friend and Westerfield (1981) correctly observed, this
finding could simply reflect the correlation between estimation
error in the betas and corresponding residual variances. Such
correlations arise in small samples when security returns have
skewed distributions.

—4—

diversifiable risk measures: multicollinearity.5 This could arise because of

the positive correlation in small samples between the measurement error in
sample betas and residual variances when security returns are skewed to the
right. Similarly, high correlation between systematic and idiosyncratic risk

measures could reflect an underlying association between the corresponding
unobservable population moments. The first possibility could account for the
inability of Friend and Westerfield (1981) and Dhrymes, Friend, Gultekin, and

Gultekin (1984) to find either significant systematic or diversifiable risk
effects in their cross—sectional regressions.

The second problem could lead

to an inability to disentangle these effects even in the absence of
measurement error. There is little evidence regarding the relative importance

of these two potential causes of collinearity between systematic and
idiosyncratic risk measures.

It is of course possible that there is no true residual risk effect or
that such an effect is nonlinear. The first possibility was sharply rejected
in Lehmann and Modest (1985) who found that portfolios sorted on the basis of

previous period total variance had highly significant intercepts, rejecting
the mean variance efficiency of the usual market proxies.

This finding is

consistent with a nonlinear residual risk effect which is surely plausible
since idiosyncratic variances should reflect the squared factor loadings of

omitted risk factors in the presence of a residual risk effect. There is no
direct evidence on the possibility of nonlinearity save for the similarity of
results obtained from either residual variance or standard deviation.

5Again, this possibility was first analyzed in detail by Miller
and Scholes (1972).

What we have then is a conundrum——no linear residual risk effect has

been

reliably measured in the literature despite strong theoretical reasons and

plausible explanations for the missing effect.

There are several

One possibility is the

inadequacy of the econometric procedures for measuring the residual risk
effect.

In particular, the existing literature has used only inefficient

grouping procedures to mitigate the harmful effects of measurement error in
both the systematic and diversifiable risk variables.6 These harmful effects
include both the usual attenuation bias associated with measurement error and

the additional problems created by positive correlation between the
measurement error in systematic and nonsystematic risk variables which results

from positive skewness in individual security returns. Moreover, no study has
yet confronted the possibility of collinearity between the true idiosyncratic

risk and systematic risk exposure of individual firms.

A detailed and

comprehensive reexamination of the empirical relevance of the residual risk
factor and its role as a maintained alternative hypothesis in asset pricing
theory tests seems clearly warranted.

The purpose of this investigation is to remedy these omissions and solve

the puzzle of the absence of a reliably measured residual risk effect. The
next section details the statistical procedures employed here to correct for

measurement error and mitigate the effects of potential true collinearity
between firm betas and residual variances. The third section examines the

betas with the Vasicek (1973) and Blume (1975) empirical Bayes
procedure for shrinking the estimates toward their common mean of

—6—

extent to which previous failures to find a residual risk effect can be
reasonably attributed to the use of inappropriate and inadequate estimation
procedures in the presence of measurement error and to the presence of true
collinearity between risk measures.

The final section provides concluding

remarks.

2. Statistical Pthods
The basic premise underlying this study is that the inability to find a
reliably measured residual risk effect may well reflect the inadequacy of the
statistical procedures employed in the previous literature.

There are three

potential weaknesses in the approaches taken in the existing literature:

(1)

the potential loss in estimation efficiency associated with the use of
ordinary least squares procedures instead of weighted or generalized least
squares; (2) inadequate corrections for measurement error in the systematic
and unsystematic risk measures; and (3) the possible deleterious consequences

of collinearity between the true systematic risk exposure and idiosyncratic
risk of individual firms.

This section is devoted to a discussion of these

issues.

The market model will serve as the basic model for systematic risk
throughout the paper.

The single index market model is a logical choice in

this context because of the large and persuasive body of evidence which
suggests its inadequacy as a comprehensive model for the systematic risk of
equity securities. As a consequence, we should expect to find a significant

residual risk effect to the extent that multifactor equilibrium and
approximate arbitrage pricing models better characterize expected security
returns. Hence, differences in the results yielded by alternative statistical

procedures presented below ought to reflect their comparative merits in actual
practice.

As a consequence, risk measurements are taken from:

The basic problem with the model for expected returns is that none of the

variables iii equation (2) is directly observed and so our procedures must
utilize imperfect measures of the relevant parameters. Following conventional

practice, equation (1) can be used to obtain estimates of it' sit' and
given appropriate assumptions regarding the variation in these parameters.
Two assumptions will be considered below. The first is that these parameters

are constant and so can be estimated efficiently by ordinary least squares.

from the application of ordinary least squares to equation (1) for months t—1

mitigate the Miller—Scholes problem.9 The second assumption is that the

to using the market model in a normative or predictive manner.

In this setting, we will still employ

these ordinary least squares estimates but must interpret them differently.
We will assume there is sufficient structure on the temporal variation in

combination of (1) and (2) yields:

estimated from the relevant time series regressions. The second concerns the
presence of the observable variable

in the coefficient on it (i.e. 1i +

E(Rmt)).
This second observation suggests two plausible cross—sectional regression

equations for measuring the relevant risk premia. By analogy with Fama and

these parameters and the risk premia, that the unconditional

goes to infinity. This will occur, for example, when a, B1
are drawn from a covariance stationary stochastic process
or when they have no autocorrelation but time varying variances
and higher order moments. There is very little serial
correlation in monthly returns which suggests that
autocorrelation in these parameters should be of little
concern. In contradistinction, considerable evidence suggests
the presence of heteroskedasticity in monthly market model
regressions.

All previous investigations of residual

risk effects have used a variant of equation (4).

A second natural form follows from the null hypothesis that Rmt is the
return on a mean variance efficient portfolio. In this eventuality, the risk

premium 1i is equal to E[RmtI which simplifies matters considerably.

By

analogy with Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972) and Blume and Friend (1973), a
second plausible cross—sectional regression equation is:

has not been employed previously in the residual risk context.

In the more conventional formulation given by equation (4), the
additional parameter y is estimated and a further test of the mean variance
efficiency of the market proxy may be obtained by comparing 11t +

sample mean of R since these risk premia sume to E[RmtI under the null

is severe (i.e. when R2 is far from

Hence,

the excess return formulation given by equation (5) might reasonably be
expected to provide a substantially more powerful test for the presence of a

residual risk effect, especially when multicollinearity is severe.

The

results in Section 3 bear this out.

The analysis thus far has largely ignored problems of estimation. The

avenue most often taken in the residual risk literature is to ignore the

distinction between the true values of it and a and their associated
estimated values and estimate equation (4) by ordinary least squares with the

time series estimates of it and cy replacing the corresponding population
moments. Of course, the application of ordinary least squares in this fashion

leads to biased and inefficient estimates of the relevant risk premia.
Matters can be improved in two ways: (1) the use of generalized least squares

instead of ordinary least squares and (2) consideration of measurement error
corrections.

Generalized least squares estimation will, in principle, lead to more
efficient estimates of the risk premia. This advantage is difficult to gauge

in practice for two reasons. The main problem is that the error terms u1 in

equation (4) and

in equation (5) reflect both the true idiosyncratic

disturbance it and the pricing error

as in equation (3).

The

idiosyncratic disturbance covariance matrix can, in principle, be estimated

from the time series estimates of the market model disturbances but the
pricing errors have an unknown covariance matrix which depends on the relation

of the inefficient proxy to the efficient frontier. The second problem is

—13—

that the number of firms in each cross—section greatly exceeds the number of

time series observations (60 months) and so the residual covariance matrix
cannot be estimated in fact without the imposition of further restrictions.

These two difficulties will be confronted in a conventional manner.
Under the hypothesis that the market proxy is mean variance efficient, the

pricing errors V are identically zero so the use of the idiosyncratic
disturbance covariance matrix of the market model disturbances is appropriate
for generalized least squares estimation. In addition, the covariances of the

market model disturbances will be ignored so that the generalized least
squares estimates reported below are better characterized as weighted or
diagonal generalized least squares estimates with the estimated idiosyncratic
variances used as weights.'2

The final estimation problem involves corrections for measurement error
in

and

The approach taken here follows the analysis in Litzenberger

and Ramaswamy (1979) with two modifications: (1) consideration of the effects

of measurement error in

as well as in it and (2) extension to the excess

return regression formulation (5) to complement the analysis along the lines

of equation (4).

Throughout this discussion, attention will be confined to

the diagonal generalized least squares version of the analysis to conserve

covariance matrix a priori. Two possibilities are zero
correlations across industries and unrestricted covariances
within industries (with industries defined by the Standard
Industrial Classification system) or a factor model. Both
strategies would greatly complicate the analysis. The present
approach was followed by Litzenberger and Ramaswamy (1979) in
their analysis of dividend effects. See Shanken (1983) for an
analysis of the statistical properties of diagonal generalized
least squares estimates.

complicated in the present setting since the residual variance

substantiated in limited experiments with the zero beta
formulation provided by Shanken. His finite sample analysis does
not extend to the case of nonnormal and heteroskedastic returns

(15). Not surprisingly, the results agreed to several
significant digits in virtually all cases. Of course, this is to
be expected given the modest magnitude of the autocorrelations of
individual monthly security returns.

data used in this paper were taken from the Center for Research in

Security Prices (cRSP) monthly returns file.

These data consist of monthly

percentage returns, inclusive of dividends and capital gains and adjusted for
stock splits and dividends, for all common stocks traded on the New York Stock

Exchange as well as equally weighted and value weighted indices of their
returns. The data employed here run from January 1926 to December 1984.

The basic inputs into the analysis are the time series estimates of

and at as well as ordinary and adjusted estimates of their standard errors.
For each month from January 1931 to December 1984, individual security returns

were taken from the cRSP monthly file for all firms that were listed for that

month and for the preceding five years (i.e. sixty months) as well.

The

average number of firms meeting the criterion for inclusion ranged from 468

for 1931 to 1935 to 1240 for the final subperiod 1976—1980.

The average

number of firms included in the cross—sectional regressions was just under 900
for the entire sample.

Table 1 provides some information about the estimation error in these
estimates in the form of sample averages of the error covariance matrices
and a1 averaged over the individual securities for the entire fifty—four year

sample and for ten five year subperiods as well.

While the averages

themselves are not terribly informative, the differences between the ordinary

and adjusted covariance matrices are interesting. Over the whole sample, the
adjusted measurement error variancs of the sample betas were approximately 18%

larger for the equally weighted index and 20% greater for the value weighted

index with especially large differences in the first fifteen years of the
sample.

The magnitude of the ratio of the adjusted and ordinary measurement

error variances of the residual variances is much more striking——more than
945% for the equally weighted index and more than 889% for the value weighted

index. Moreover, the ratio of these average variances was in excess of 2257.

This is an obvious consequence of the

Similarly, the OLS estimates with both measurement

As a consequence, Tables 4 and 5 provide the results obtained from this

as well to indicate the presence of any collinearity between the beta effect

this alternative formulation.

These results indicate that the model given by equation (17) provides
reliable estimates of the residual risk effect when more efficient estimation

methods are coupled with appropriate measurement error corrections.

The

measured effect is substantially more significant when generalized least

squares estimation is employed instead of ordinary least squares.

More importantly,

generalized least squares estimation coupled with the adjusted measurement
error correction yields a substantially more significant measured residual
risk effect than either the conventional measurement error correction or no
measurement error correction.20 This finding appears to justify the concerns
about heteroskedasticity discussed in Section 2 and suggests the usefulness of

—24—

the adjusted measurement error correction in actual practice.

Tables 6 and 7 examine the degree of nonstationarity of the residual risk

effect in three dimensions for the equally weighted and value weighted
indices, respectively. First, the means

and

as well as the marginal

significance levels of their t statistics are reported for ten five year
subperiods. Second, these means and marginal significance levels are provided

both with and without the inclusion of the cross—sectional regression
coefficients computed in Januaries due to the well—documented seasonality in

stock returns. Finally, the tables offer two measures of serial correlation
in the measured risk effect——a serial correlation coefficient and the usual x2

statistic for the joint significance of the first twelve autocorrelations
along with their marginal significance levels.

Table 6 provides the first

order autocorrelation coefficient while Table 7 gives the twelfth order one.

These quantities are provided for only the excess return model (5) estimated
by generalized least squares with the adjusted measurement error correction in
order to conserve space.

Table 6 reveals remarkably little evidence of nonstationarity in the
measured residual risk effect associated with the equally weighted index. The

subperiod sample means of

large that it is likely that they are not significantly different at
conventional levels.

The subperiod means differ surprisingly little when

little serial correlation.

Finally, they exhibit remarkably

The first twelve autocorrelations are jointly

significant at the 5% level for only the 1936 to 1940 subperiod while the ten
subperiod x2 statistics are jointly insignificant at conventional levels.2'

—25-

However, the first order serial correlation coefficients are significant at 5%

level for two subperiods (1961—65 and 1976—80).

It is likely that precise

measurement of any nonstationarity of the residual risk effect would require
an explicit model of time variation in the systematic and idiosyncratic risk
measures.

By contrast, Table 7 reveals considerably nonstationarity in the residual

risk effect measured with respect to the value weighted index.

The most

striking evidence consists of the substantial and highly significant
differences in the mean values of X2 computed with and without January
returns. Moreover, the first twelve autocorrelations are jointly significant

in four out of ten five year subperiods at the 5% level while the ten
subperiod

statistics are jointly significant below the .5% level.22 The

source of this measured autocorrelation is not in the first order serial
correlations, none of which are significant at the 10% level, but rather is in

the large measured autocorrelations at lag twelve reported in Table 7.

This

is, of course, consistent with the January effect implicit in Table 7. These

results are not surprising since the value weighted index is basically an

index of returns on large firms and the January seasonal is a small firm
effect.

21The x2 statistics for each subperiod are independent under the
null hypothesis. Since sums of independent x2 statistics are
distributed x2 as well, the joint significance of the subperod
autocorrelations can be tested by examining the sum of the x
statistics reported in Table 6. Their sum is 129.25 and is
distributed as x2 with 120 degrees of freedom which has a
marginal significance level of .2659.
22Their sum is 165.29 and is distributed as x2 with 120 degrees
of freedom under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation with a
marginal significance level of .0030.

—26—

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the subperiod results reported in
Tables 6 and 7 reflect a pronounced residual risk effect irrespective of any
possible nonstationarities. The ten subsample mean values of

are jointly

significantly different from zero at conventional significance levels for both

indices and with and without the inclusion of January returns. In addition,

several of the subsample means have marginal significance levels below the

conventional 5% and 1% levels.

The use of generalized least squares

estimation of equation (17) coupled with the adjusted measurement error
correction produced reliable estimates of a substantive residual risk effect
which had a decided effect on security returns in many subperiods.

4. Conclusion
This paper had a simple motivation. There is considerable evidence that

the residuals from the single index market model contain factors which are

asssociated with nonzero risk premia.

Consequently, the idiosyncratic

variances from the one factor model should partially reflect exposure to these

omitted sources of systematic risk and, hence, should help explain expected
returns.

There are two plausible explanations for the inability to obtain

statistically reliable estimates of linear residual risk effect in the
previous literature: (1) nonlinearity of the residual risk effect and (2) the

inadequacy of the statistical procedures employed to measure it.

The

econometric methods employed previously are more plausible culprits since
linearity is probably a reasonable first order approximation.

Hence, the

search for a residual risk effect provides a natural laboratory for the
investigation of the efficacy of alternative statistical procedures for
measuring risk premia.

—27—

This laboratory provided an apt setting for this investigation and
yielded considerable information regarding the anatomy of the residual risk
effect.

Three conclusions warrant special mention.

The first is that the

absence of a reliably measured residual risk effect in the previous literature

appears to be a direct consequence of the inappropriate estimation procedures
employed there.

In particular, generalized least squares estimation coupled

with correction for measurement error in the sample betas and residual
variances yields a pronounced residual risk effect. Second, there appears to
be considerable collinearity among a vector of ones and the true values of the

betas from the one factor model and the associated idiosyncratic variances.
As a consequence, it is important to utilize the excess return formulation (5)

to more efficiently estimate the residual risk effect. Finally, there appears

to be relatively little nonstationarity in the residual risk effect measured
with respect to the equally weighted index but there is a pronounced January

seasonal in that yielded by the value weighted index.

Of course, this is

unsurprising since this residual risk effect is likely to reflect the small
firm effect since the value weighted index is a large firm index.

The hypothesis that expected returns depend on both systematic and
residual risk ought to provide a sharp analytical knife for testing the
validity of modern asset pricing theories in which expected returns depend
solely on systematic risk exposure.

This paper has demonstrated that the

residual risk hypothesis is a tool well—suited to this purpose only when
wielded appropriately.

However, when the model for expected returns is

estimated with proper econometric methods, the residual risk hypothesis can
serve as a powerful maintained alternative hypothesis.
