ABSTRACT
This paper provides additional evidence on the U-shaped relationship between the process of economic
development and women's labor force participation. The experience of the United States is studied
in a comparative perspective relative to a sample of rich economies observed over the period 1890-2005.
The analysis confirms the existence of a U-shaped female labor supply function, coming from both
cross-country and within country variation. Further analysis of a large cross section of economies observed
over the post-WWII period suggests that the timing of a country's transition to a modern path of economic
development affects the shape of women's labor supply.

Introduction

The nature and extent of segmentation of economic activity across genders and its changing
roles during the course of economic development has been a central topic of inquire since
Ester Boserup’s pioneering work on Woman’s Role in Economic Development. This is of
course a complex phenomenon and it’s systematic analysis is complicated by measurement
issues. Goldin’s work greatly contributed to its understanding and inspired much of the
subsequent work on the topic. In a series of seminal papers, Goldin establishes the existence
of a U-shaped labor supply of women across the process of economic development, and the
important roles played by education and the emergence of a white-collar sector in fostering
the paid employment of married women.
The absence of a clear distinction between market production and work for the family
affects the measurement of labor force participation in early phases of economic development,
especially for women. Goldin’s extensive work to fill the gaps in the historical record on
women’s work in the United States reveals that female labor force participation was Ushaped: it declined during the 19th century, reached the bottom sometimes in the 1920s, and
then it steadily increased during the 20th century.
Goldin (1986, 1990) argues that, until the late nineteenth century, women in the United
States, whether married or single, worked almost exclusively in the home or as unpaid labor
in family enterprises. This work involved not only the care of children and the upkeep of
the house, but also goods production activities such as the cultivation and preparation of
food and the manufacture of many of the goods used in the home or sold in the marketplace
(clothing, canned food etc.). Women, both on farms and in cities, were active participants in
the labor force when the home and work activities could be performed in the same place. But
their participation declined as the nature of the production process changed and production
moved from the household to factories and offices.
Official statistics, however, might not capture the full extent of female participation to the
labor market going back in time, especially for married women. According to Census data,
the labor participation for white women was 16.3 percent in 1890 and it increased to 24.5
percent by 1940, when the census established its labor force construct. As shown in Goldin
(1990), the figure for 1890 heavily underestimates women’s work, especially for married, white
women whose participation rate was particularly low, 2.5 percent (data are from Goldin 1990,
Table 2.1). Based on her calculations, adding paid and unpaid farm labor of married women
and boardinghouse keepers would imply a labor force participation rate for white women in
1890 similar to that observed in 1940. Moreover, Goldin (1986) shows that female labor force
participation in 1890 might have been considerably lower than earlier in the 19th century and
in the late 18th century. Thus, more inclusive measures of labor supply trace a U-shaped

2

function: after declining for about a century, the female labor force participation rate was as
high in 1940 as it was in 1890 and kept rising thereafter. The bottom of the U must have
occurred somewhere between 1890 and 1940.
Goldin (1995) finds further evidence of a U-shaped female labor supply function with
economic development (as measured by GDP per capita) using a large cross-section of countries observed in the first half of the 1980s. Goldin also establishes that increasing women’s
education and the emergence of the white-collar sector are important determinants of this
pattern, both historically and across countries. Subsequent work by Mammen and Paxson
(2000), Luci (2009) and Lundberg (2010) provides additional evidence of a U-shaped labor
supply based on larger panels of economies observed in the 1970s and 1980s and for the years
1965 to 2005, respectively.1
This paper builds on this work by providing additional evidence on the relationship between the process of economic development and women’s labor force participation. Specifically, it investigates whether the United States experience was exceptional historically and
whether the timing of a country’s transition to a modern path of economic development
affects the shape of women’s labor supply.
First, the experience of the United States is studied in a comparative perspective relative
to a sample of economically advanced economies. Pre-WWII data on labor force participation rates and sectoral employment by gender from the International Historical Statistics
(IHS, Mitchell, 1998) are combined with comparable post-WWII data from the International
Labour Organization (ILO) to construct a sample of sixteen developed economies for which
data are consistently available for most of the 1890 to 2005 period. The sample includes the
following countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United
States.2 The analysis confirms the existence of a U-shaped female labor supply function,
coming from both cross-country and within country variation.
Next, ILO data for the years 1950 to 2005 are used to study the link between female labor
force participation and income in a large cross-section of countries. The analysis of this long
panel confirms the findings of Goldin (1990), Mammen and Paxson (2000) and Luci (2009).
In addition, it shows that the U-shape is more muted when early OECD economies are not
included in the sample. One possible explanation of this evidence is that the stigma towards
married women’s participation to labor market, or women’s dislike for factory production,
might be lower when manufacturing production is cleaner or less brawn intensive than it was
1

See Blau, Ferber and Winkler (2010, Chapter 12) for a comparative discussion of a recent cross-section of
world economies. This work includes a discussion of the experience of the former Soviet countries as well as
differences among African economies.

Far from being perfect, these data are as close as possible to being harmonized in terms of the definition
of the employment construct. See section 3.1 and section 7 for a detailed discussion.

in the 19th century. For example, if, as it is the case with electronics in Asia, industrialization
is associated with an increased demand for fine motor skills (in which women have a comparative advantage), then industrialization can generate an increase in women’s relative wages
that, by counteracting the income effect, could potentially be associated with a smaller drop
in female labor force participation.
Lastly, the evolution of women’s employment is linked to the process of structural transformation. This process is defined in the growth literature as the reallocation of labor across
the three main sectors of production: agriculture, manufacturing and services.3 The typical
process of sectoral reallocation over the course of economic development involves a systematic
fall in the share of labor allocated to agriculture, a hump-shaped change in the share of labor
in manufacturing, which increases in the early stages of the reallocation process and then
declines, and a steady increase in the share of labor in services. This paper establishes gender differentials in the process of sectoral re-allocation. The share of women employed in the
agricultural sector drops more rapidly than that of men. The employment share in manufacturing exhibits the distinct hump-shaped profile for both genders but women’s profile is much
flatter than men’s. The employment share in services increases much more rapidly for women
than for men. Interestingly, the gender differentials are smaller in emerging economies.
Taken together, these findings seem to suggest that the timing of a country’s transformation from agriculture to manufacturing determines whether female labor force participation
experiences the first, downward portion of the U. The U-shaped association between economic development and female labor force participation seems to be a feature of economies
that went through the transition from agriculture to manufacturing in the nineteenth century.
The cleaner, precision manufacturing of the present time and the rapidly expanding service
economy in some developing countries may be less likely to trigger norms against women’s
work.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the
literature. Section 3 discusses data collection and presents the analysis for the historical
sample of developed economies. Section 4 analyzes the cross-section of world’s economies
from 1950 to 2005. Section 5 documents gender differentials associated to the process of
structural transformation. Section 6 concludes.
3

This process has been extensively documented starting with the work by Kuznets (1966) and Maddison
(1980). Recent work by Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013) provides systematic evidence about the
‘facts’ of structural transformation for a large cross-section of countries and going back in time as far as
possible.

Background

The relationship between gender equality and economic development has been widely investigated. On the one end, gender equality contributes to economic development, particularly
when the well-being of children is involved. On the other end, economic development might
foster gender equality. Among the many useful indicators of women’s economic status, including women’s educational attainment, health, role in politics and legal rights, labor force
participation is arguably the most fundamental to the evolution of gender roles. However, in
the early stages of economic development growth initially lowers female participation to the
(formal) labor market, and only subsequently is associated with higher female employment.
For this reason, Goldin (1995) points out that the positive relationship between women’s
status and economic development might be camouflaged, and opposing views on whether
economic growth enhances gender equality might arise.
What do we know or can speculate about the U-shaped female labor supply function and
its determinants?
A rich literature exists that analyzes this phenomenon with reference to supply and demand factors that played an important role in the evolution of female labor force participation, and can explain the observed cross-country variation (cfr. Goldin (1990, 2006), Blau
(1998) and Blau and Kahn (2007) for a comprehensive discussion of the factors affecting the
trends in the United States at different points in time; Blau et. al. (2010, Ch.11) for international comparisons, and Lundberg (2010) for a discussion of the changing sexual division of
labor with economic development.) Here, the discussion is organized around the link between
female labor force participation and structural transformation.
Women’s presumably distinct influence on production across phases of economic development, ranging from agricultural to industrial and postindustrial, depends on the degree of
substitution between their own labor in agricultural production and other activities, on the
degree of substitution between labor and capital, and between male and female labor inputs
under different production, organizational, and social conditions.
For example, the declining portion of the U-shape can be explained by the change in the
nature of agricultural work as an economy moves away from subsistence agriculture. This
change typically involves a shift from very labor-intensive technologies, where women are
heavily involved as family workers, to capital-intensive agricultural technologies where men
tend to have a comparative advantage because of the physical strength these technologies
require. For example, as noted by Boserup (1970), plough cultivation is much more capital
intensive than shifting cultivation, and it requires significant strength to be operated. Because of these requirements, she argues, when plough agriculture is practiced, men have an
advantage in farming, and this might originate traditional gender role attitudes that affect

5

the gender division of labor, potentially lowering female labor force participation.4
The early transition to a mostly industrial economy is characterized by conflicting forces
affecting women’s work. For instance, in the United States, the expansion of the manufacturing sector was accompanied by a process of de-skilling as the factory system began to displace
the artisanal shop in the 1820s (Goldin and Sokoloff 1982). De-skilling became rapidly more
marked as production increasingly mechanized with the adoption of steam power after 1850
(Atack, Bateman, and Margo 2008). Goldin and Sokoloff (1984) argue that the United States
agricultural areas, where the marginal products of females and children are low relative to
those of adult men (which is, in and of itself a function of the agricultural technology used),
were the first to industrialize. This “relative productivity hypothesis” predicts that the lower
the relative productivity of females and children in the pre-industrial agricultural or traditional economy, the earlier manufacturing is likely to evolve.
Thus, it seems that with the increasing industrialization happening during the 19th century there was initially a greater demand for (relatively unskilled) female labor. Why then
female labor force participation decreased during early industrialization?
First, as shown by Katz and Margo (2013), the demand for unskilled female workers was
probably not exceedingly high. They show that the share of female workers was positively
correlated with the use of steam and water power, and with capital deepening. However,
the positive correlation largely disappears (becoming negative for steam power) once they
control for establishment size, which is positively associated with the percent of unskilled
workers, as in Goldin and Sokoloff (1982). Moreover, as they argue, “the evidence on size
and relative use of female and child labor might not reflect the full extent of division of labor
in nineteenth century manufacturing, because many establishments did not hire women or
children, and yet were relatively large.” (Katz and Margo, 2013, pg. 23)
Second, there was some kind of redistribution of employment across groups, as single
women, who began to leave the house to work in factories, displaced widows handling the
artisanal shop of their deceased husbands (Goldin, 1986).
Third, as emphasized in Goldin (1990), production processes in the early phases of industrialization were characterized by dirty, noisy and often physically demanding jobs. While it
might be acceptable for a single woman to work in such conditions, the expectation was that
a single woman would work only until her marriage. Stated differently, there was a stigma
against married women working as manual laborers in factory-type work.5 Because of the
changing nature of agricultural production, as well as the stigma attached to women’s em4

Recent work by Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2013) proves Boserup’s hypothesis right. They show that
still today the descendants of societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture, have less equal gender
norms and female participation in the workplace, as well as in politics and entrepreneurial activities.
5
The stigma towards a working married woman was strong. In August 1936, a Gallup Poll asked: “Should
a married woman earn money if she has a husband capable of supporting her?”. A resounding 82 percent
answered yes.

ployment in manufacturing, the ‘income effect’ dominates during this phase of development,
and female labor force participation declines.
The increasing portion of the U during the transition from the industrial to the postindustrial phase of economic development is unambiguously associated with increasing female
labor force participation and changing gender roles. The expansion of the service sector with
its attendant white-collar jobs and/or the pervasive skilled-biased technological change in
the economy (see Goldin and Katz, 2008, and Katz and Margo, 2013) greatly facilitate this
transformation (Goldin, 1990, 2006). As intellectual skills grew in importance in market production relatively to physical power, increasing relative wages lowered fertility and increased
labor force participation (Galor and Weil, 1996).6 Other types of technological progress reinforced this process by affecting women’s investment in human capital and fertility choices.7
This discussion, of course, provides an incomplete representation of the vast literature on
this topic. Section 5 will return to the link between structural transformation and female
labor supply.

The American Experience in Comparative Perspective: Developed Economies.

This section uses data from sixteen high-income countries over the period 1890 to 2005 to trace
the relationship between economic development and women’s labor force participation. The
data set is constructed using information reported from the International Historical Statistics
(Mitchell, 1998) and, for the post-1950 period, the International Labour Organization (ILO).8
The past experience of economically advanced countries is interesting. While they are similar
to the United States in many ways, they transitioned across stages of economic development
at different points in time. Table 1 summarizes statistics on log GDP per capita expressed in
1990 international dollars (column 2), sectoral employment shares (column 3 to 5) and value
added shares (column 6 to 8), for a subset of developed economies at three points in time:
1890, 1950, and 2000. The first panel in the table reports statistics for the United States
followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Sweden and the UK.9 .
6

Most models in this vein predict a monotonic relationship between growth and female labor force participation. Galor and Weill (1996, pg. 384-385) is an exception. They propose extensions of their model that can
generate the U-shaped labor supply. For example, by adding a technology for producing market goods that is
not fully rival with raising children at home and does not require capital.
7
For example, progress in medical technologies related to motherhood (Albanesi and Olivetti, 2011),
progress in contraceptive technology (Goldin and Katz, 2002, Bailey, 2006) and progress in household technologies in new domestic appliances (Greenwood, Seshadri and Yorukoglu, 2005). Changing cultural norms and
attitudes towards gender roles might also have played a role (see for example, Fernandez, Fogli and Olivetti,
2004, Fogli and Veldkamp, 2011, and Fernandez, 2013.)

Data on GDP per capita are from Maddison, 2010. Sectoral data are constructed and discussed in
Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2012). The choice of this specific subset of economies in my sample is

7

The range of experiences spanned by these countries is quite heterogeneous. The UK had
the highest (log) GDP per capita in 1890, only 16 percent of its workers were employed in
agriculture and the agricultural value added share was below 10 percent, a relatively “postindustrial” value. The UK, in other words, was well ahead in its process of industrialization.
The manufacturing sector employed 44 percent of its workers (valued added share of 41 percent). The broad service sector employed 40 percent of its workers and had the highest valued
added share, 50 percent. The other countries were well behind in the process of structural
transformation. In the United States, the country with the third highest log GDP per capita
in 1890, the employment share in agriculture was still quite high (42 percent), although the
size of the sector as measured by its value added share was already less than 20 percent,
an indication of low labor productivity in agriculture. The rest of the economically active
population was equally distributed in the manufacturing sector (27 percent) and in services
(30 percent), but the service sector had the largest valued added share (46 percent). The remaining economies were still prevalently agricultural at the turn of the 20th Century. At least
half of the economically active population in France, Spain and Sweden, the three countries
with the lowest log GDP per capita in 1890, was employed in agriculture. However, by 1950
most of these countries had industrialized and were on the verge of a phase of rapid economic
growth. In all countries, except for Spain, the employment share in agriculture had dropped
to less than 30 percent (with a value added share around or below 10 percent), and the log of
GDP per capita was around 9, a level that is associated with the onset of the decline of the
manufacturing sector and the rise of the so-called service economy (Herrendorf et al. 2012).
By 2000, all the countries in the table are in a mature phase of economic development. The
employment and value added shares are 5 percent or lower in agriculture, approximately 20
percent in manufacturing, and 70 percent or higher in the service sector.10
Table 1 shows that, although these countries are comparable in terms of standards of
living (and have been since the 1970s, at least), they still display substantial cross-country
variation in the timing of economic development and industrial transformation. Consequently,
looking at the past experience of currently developed economies can contribute to our understanding of the U-shape relationship between economic development and female labor force
participation.

3.1

Data and Measurement Issues

The history of women’s participation in market work is complicated by measurement issues.
The concept of being in the labor force is often ambiguous, and its definition can vary
substantially across countries and time periods as well as over time within a country. This
guided by the availability of sectoral value added shares from Herrendorf et al. (2013).
10
The convergence of employment and valued added shares during economic development is yet another
interesting regularity documented in Herrendorf et al. (2013).

8

section describes the data collection effort and data comparability across countries and within
a country over time. The end product is a balanced panel of 16 high-income economies for
which data are available for most of the period. That is, for these countries, information by
gender spanning the entire 1890-2005 period on both labor force participation, defined over
the population aged 15 and above, and the sectoral distribution of workers is consistently
available. This sample of “developed economies” includes: Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States. The year 1890 is the first for which a
starting data point is available for almost all countries, except Australia and Denmark for
which the first available year is 1900. The end date is the latest year for which International
Labour Organization (ILO) statistics are available. The data are available at 10- or 5-year
intervals for most of the countries in the sample. Starting with 1990, data at 5-year intervals
are available for all countries.11
The United States
Prior to 1940, only workers who reported an occupation were classified as ‘gainfully employed’
and thus included in the labor force in the United States. Starting in 1940, and consistent
with the ILO construct of ‘economically active’ population, the definition of labor force
participation was revised to include all individuals working for pay, unpaid family workers,
and also the unemployed seeking work during the survey week. It is not surprising then
that the International Historical Statistics (IHS), that uses the ILO definition of labor force
participation, does not report data for the United States prior to 1940. To circumvent
this problem, this paper combines 1890 to 1930 female labor force participation rates from
Goldin (1990, Table 2.1, first row), with 1940 to 2005 data from the IHS and the ILO, in
the same way as for the other countries in the sample.12 Note that when they overlap (that
is, between 1940 and 1980), the labor force participation statistics from the IHS and the
ILO are almost identical to those from Table 2.1 in Goldin (1990). This perfect overlap is
also noted in Goldin (1990, pg. 43). She argues that the 1940 change in the definition of
employment has no effect on the participation rate of women: “Applying the labor force
concept to the pre-1940 data produces approximately the same numbers as obtained by the
gainful worker definition”. Goldin (1990, pg. 44) also shows that the most important source
of bias for female labor force participation comes from the undercounting of people working
as boardinghouse keepers, unpaid family farm workers and manufacturing workers in homes
and in factories. This is because women were disproportionately engaged in these activities.
11

Keeping only the statistics at 10-year intervals or changing the start and end point of the sample does not
significantly alter the main findings of the analysis.
12
Labor force participation rates for men aged 15 and above for years prior to 1940 were gathered from
Pencavel (1986, Tables 1.1). See section 7 for further details.

9

Section 3.2 returns to this point.
Other Countries
It is difficult to construct somewhat comparable female labor force statistics going back to
the second half of the 19th Century for a relative large cross section of countries. Goldin’s discussion centers on U.S. statistics, however, and similar concerns about undercounting women
working in family enterprises or working for very few hours generally applies. For example,
Costa (2000) discusses the existence of similar measurement issues related to historical data
on female participation for France and Great Britain. Here, pre-WWII data on economically
active population by gender and by industrial group, as well as population counts by gender
from the IHS (Mitchell, 1998) are combined with similar post-WWII data from the ILO.
Based on this data a long time series of labor force participation rates for women and men
aged 15 and above can be constructed.13 Far from being perfect, these data are probably as
close as possible to being harmonized in terms of the definition of the employment construct.
This is the ILO definition that classifies an individual as economically active if he/she is working for pay or profit at any time during the specific reference period, whether he/she receives
wages or not. This definition of employment varies across countries, but it generally includes
unpaid family farm workers, those in family business, and own-account traders. According
to Mitchell (1998, pg. 161), the statistics prior to 1968 were unified across different countries
and different time periods to adhere to this definition as much as possible. Post-1968 IHS
data were pulled directly from the ILO tables, and thus should be harmonized using sophisticated estimation and imputation procedures.14 Recent versions of the ILO labor statistics
report data starting with the 1940s. This overlap between the available ILO and IHS statistics is exploited to detect and fix inconsistencies in the data (see section 7 for details). As a
consequence of this further check, some of the 19th Century data points had to be dropped
from the sample. The resulting panel of 16 countries is analyzed below.15 Comparisons between countries, however, must still be made with some caution owing to remaining potential
differences in classification, including differences in the definition of “economically active”.
13

See section 7 for additional details. Unfortunately, the data do not allow the construction of historical
labor force statistics by age.
14
See ILO report (2011) for a discussion of the difficulties collecting high quality data for women’s labor
force participation.
15
For a few of these countries, namely Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, it is possible to calculate labor
force participation rates by gender going as far back as 1840-1850. The trade-off is that the statistics for the
earlier decades of the 19th Century, especially pre-1870, are only available for a very small subset of countries.
Using 1890 as a start date delivers the most balanced panel of countries going as far back in time as possible.
The results of the analysis are basically unchanged if the sample starts in 1870 or 1880.

10

3.2

Long-run trends in female labor force participation

Figure 1 displays female labor force participation rates for each of the 16 countries in the
sample. Based on the figure, it is possible to loosely identify two alternative patterns for the
evolution of female labor supply.
Female labor force participation grew monotonically in the United States and Canada.
Only 18 percent of women in the U.S. worked for pay in 1890 and the figure had risen to
around 26 percent in 1940, when the definition of the employment construct changes. By
year 2000 women’s participation rate in the United States was around 60 percent. However,
as argued by Goldin (1990) the 1890 figure is artificially low because it undercounts the paid
and unpaid work of married women within the home and on the farm. Goldin estimates a 7
percentage points adjustment in female labor force participation for 1890, mostly stemming
from unpaid employment of family members in agriculture and from widespread boarding in
late 19th Century cities (see, Table 2.9 in Goldin, 1990, p. 44). The adjustment implies that
female labor force participation in 1890 was in the vicinity of 26 percent, that is, as high as in
1940.16 It follows that, as argued by Goldin (1990, pg. 45), the “obvious implication is that
the labor force activity of adult and married women must have reached a minimum point
sometime just after the turn of the century, falling before that time and rising after. Thus
the participation of married women in the labor force may well be somewhat U-shaped over
the course of economic development.”

17

Although, the monotonicity of female labor supply

might be genuine for Canada, It is reasonable to think that undercounting of womens paid
or unpaid work at home and on the farm might be also be plaguing these estimates.
In most of the remaining countries, the trends in female labor force participation are Ushaped, although in some cases the U is more muted than in others. Women’s participation
rates in Great Britain were the same in the early 1960s as they were in the past two decades of
the 19th Century. This pattern is consistent with the analysis in Costa (2000). Belgium also
exhibits a U-shaped trend; female labor force participation hovers around 41 percent from
1890 to 1910, and then drops substantially and starts increasing again in the 1950s, reaching
back to 41 percent only by the mid-1990s. Ireland’s trend is very similar to that observed for
Belgium. Spain, Portugal and Italy also exhibit a U-shaped female labor supply although at
lower levels of female labor force participation. The female participation rate in Spain was
the same, around 23 percent, in 1890 as in 1970. In Italy women’s labor force participation
in year 2000 was still 13 percentage points lower than in 1900. Female labor supply is also
16

Most of the adjustment comes from white married women. Goldin (1990), estimates a rate of omission
of 10 percentage points for this group. This implies a 12.5 percent labor force participation rate for white
married women in 1890, as opposed to the 2.5 percent figure from the Census.
17
In other work, Goldin (1986) shows that female labor force participation might have been even higher at
the turn of the 19th century, thus implying an even stronger U-shape. Using data from 26 cities and business
directories for Philadelphia, she estimates that in 1800 the labor force participation rate for female head of
households (mostly widows) was around 65 percent, dropping to approximately 45 percent by 1860.

U-shaped in Australia, the Netherlands, and Sweden, although the U is more muted in these
countries. Finally, France and Finland both display a slightly N-shaped pattern for female
labor supply. Female labor force participation in France was around 44 percent at the turn of
the 20th Century, it peaked to 53 percent in 1920, and then dropped and raised again during
the course of the 20th century. Yet, by year 2000 female labor force participation was still
lower than in 1920.18 Finland’s trend is very similar to France’s, although the peak of the N
occurs twenty years later, in 1940.

Female labor force participation and economic development

Having discussed the trends, Figure 2 plots the relationship between female labor force participation and log GDP per capita. The distinct U-shape relationship between the two series
is apparent. Female participation rates tend to be high, above 40 percent, both at low and
at high levels of income per capita, and dip below 40 percent in between.
Table 2 reports the results of a quadratic regression of labor force participation against
log GDP per capita and its square term. Column 1 to 3 report the results obtained for women
as we progressively add year and country fixed effects. Column 4 displays the estimates for
men based on the full specification.
Column 1 displays the estimates for the fitted U-shaped line shown in Figure 2. All
coefficients are statistically significant at the 1 percent level. This result is based on comparing
women’s labor force participation in a set of countries observed over multiple time periods and
it could be driven by some other (common) aggregate factors that are changing over time.
Thus the specification in column 2 adds year fixed effects, something akin to comparing
repeated cross sections of countries by year. The estimates are statistically significant at the
5 percent level, though the U becomes slightly more muted in this case. Column 3 reports the
results when instead we add both year and country fixed effects. This specification allows to
study the evolution of female labor force participation in individual countries as they grow.
With country fixed effects the shape of the U is identified from variation in income within
a country over time, rather than from the cross-country variation. At the same time, year
fixed effects account for differences across years that are common to all countries. The main
finding is confirmed, although the U-shape is slightly more muted than in the previous cases
and the point estimates on log GDP per capita and its square are now statistically significant
only at the 10 percent level. Finally, column 4 reports the estimates for males using the same
specification as in column 3. Males can be seen as a placebo group since almost all men aged
15 or above work and this is true at all levels of economic development spanned by this panel
of countries.19 Consistent with this hypothesis, I find no clear relationship between male

Costa (2000, figure 2) documents the same pattern for France using a different data source.
With the caveat that in all countries there is a declining trend in male labor supply driven by increasing
years of education and early retirement.

labor force participation and economic development. The estimates are very small and not
statistically significant.20
To ease the interpretation of the results in Table 2, Figure 3, Panel A, graphs the implied
relationship between labor force participation and income based on the estimates in column
2 and 3.21 The figure shows that the country fixed effects estimates produce a slightly more
muted U-shape, but the two curves are not substantially different from each other. That is,
a quadratic can capture equally well the evolution of female labor force participation across
countries and for individual countries as they grow. This is not surprising in light of the
finding that in many of the countries in this sample female labor force participation traces
a U-shape over time (see Figure 1) but, as shown in the next section, this is not a pattern
that generally holds for the post-WWII period.
As discussed in section 2, one of the regularities established in the literature on structural
transformation is that the manufacturing share peaks when log GDP per capita is around
9 (Herrendorf et al. 2013). This peak corresponds to the onset of the expansion of the
so-called service economy. Based on the estimates in Table 2, we can compare the trough
of the U-shaped labor supply function to the peak of the manufacturing share. The lowest
female labor force participation rate is 29 percent for the regression with year effects and 32
percent for the country effect specification, corresponding to a log GDP per capita of 8.04 and
7.98, respectively (equivalent to 1990 international dollars 2,900 and 3,100). These estimates
indicate that the growth in female labor force participation precedes the acceleration in the
growth of the service sector. Men may gain from the shift away from agriculture initially,
with more robust manufacturing growth, but women who concentrate in service sector jobs
are well positioned in what will eventually be the leading sector.

Female Labor Force Participation and Economic Development: 1950-2005

This section analyzes a full sample of advanced and emerging economies for the period 1950
to 2005.22 The purpose of repeating the analysis for this larger sample is twofold. First, it
enables the further investigation of the relationship between female labor force participation
20

To mitigate concerns that the results in Table 2 might be driven by cross-country differences in employment classification, a specification is also run where the dependent variable is the female-to-male labor force
participation ratio (miss-measurement should be, at least in part, common across genders within a country).
The results confirm the main findings based on levels.
21
Because the level of the U in the country and year effect specification differs across countries, the vertical
position of the function is scaled so that it lies at the average position of the curve across all countries.
22
Labor force participation data were pulled directly from the ILO web page, see section 7 for details. Note
that the analysis in this paper is consistent with that by Goldin (1995), and Mammen and Paxson (2000)
based on the United Nations WISTAT collection. This is because the labor statistics in WISTAT are taken
from the ILO. Data on educational attainment by gender are from Barro and Lee (2010).

13

and economic development by using information on education and labor force participation
rates by age group that is not available for the longer data series. Second, it enables to study
whether the findings in the previous section apply more generally.
Table 3 presents the results of this analysis. Column (1) reports the coefficients for the
basic regressions with no controls, column (2) and (3) include year effects, column (4) to (6)
include both year and country fixed effects. Following Goldin (1995), column (3) and (5) add
the log gender differential (male-female) in years of schooling. Finally, column (6) reports the
results for males. The concept of labor force participation in the first panel is the fraction of
economically active women aged 15 to 64. The second panel reports the results for women
aged 45 to 59. Fertility is higher in countries with lower living standard and, at the same
time, it is inversely related to female labor force participation in a cross section of developed
and developing economies (Feyer, Sacerdote and Stern, 2008). The 45-59 age restriction, also
used by Goldin (1995) and Mammen and Paxson (2000), helps minimizing the confounding
effect that cross-country differences in fertility might have on the correlation between female
labor force participation and GDP per capita.
Entries in Table 3 confirm the results obtained for the historical sample of developed
economies. Every specification shows a significant U-shaped relationship between female
labor force participation and log GDP per capita, though the U is more muted once we
control for country fixed effects. This effect holds controlling for the gender gap in years of
schooling and for both measures of female labor force participation, although, as predicted
by the theory, the U-shape is more marked for women past their childbearing age. At any
level of economic development, female labor force participation is lower when women have
fewer years of schooling relative to men (column 3), although the coefficient is not significant
when adding country effects (column 5). There is no evidence of a U-shaped labor supply
for men. If anything, consistent with trends in early retirement, labor force participation of
men aged 45 to 59 declines at higher levels of economic development.
Table 4 reports the results when early OECD economies (i.e., countries that joined the
OECD before 1973) are excluded from the sample (see footnotes to Table 4 for the list of
countries). The results in column 1 to 3 are broadly similar to those observed in Table 3,
except for the fact that the U-shape is now more muted, especially when we use labor force
participation of women aged 15 to 64. However, unlike in the previous two tables, the Ushape disappears once we control for country effect (column 4 and 5). In other words, for
non-OECD economies, female labor force participation does not drop as much as in the full
sample as income per capita increases. Interestingly, the labor supply of older men does not
decline with GDP as in the full sample and in the sample of developed economies (column
6). This indicates that, while being typical of rich economies, early retirement is not a staple

14

of emerging economies.23
To ease the comparison of the results across samples, Figure 3, Panel B and C, illustrates
how the U-shape varies, within and across countries, based, respectively, on the estimates for
the 1950-2005 full sample (column 2 and 4, table 3), and for the sample that excludes early
OECD economies (column 2 and 4, table 4). The figure highlights interesting differences in
the predicted relationship between female labor force participation and income, both across
panel B and C and relatively to the results in Panel A. For all samples, the solid line traces a
significant U-shape that becomes more muted once we keep only countries that were not part
of the OECD as of 1973. In both panel B and C, participation rates are at least 50 percent,
both at low and high levels of income. The trough of the U occurs when log GDP per capita
is 8.1 (in panel B) and 8.4 (panel C). The corresponding female labor force participation rate
is around 35 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Differences across samples emerge once
we add country fixed effects. For the full-sample (panel B), the U-shape predicted by the
regression with country effect is flatter relative to the specification with only year effects.24
Moreover, the difference between the solid and the dashed line is larger than that observed
for the sample of developed countries. For the sample of non-OECD economies (panel C), the
line predicted by the regression with country effect is flat. If anything it declines slightly. For
the specification with country and year effects, the bottom of the U corresponds to a female
labor force participation rate of 34 percent observed when log GDP per capita is equal to
8.4 (in panel B), and to a 42 percent female labor force participation rate when log GDP per
capita equals 9.4 (panel C). Interestingly, for the sample that drops OECD economies the
GDP level corresponding to the through of female labor force participation roughly coincides
with the peak of the manufacturing employment share.
The findings are summarized in Figure 3, which suggests that the presence of a U-shaped
female labor supply might depend on the specifics of the process of structural transformation
of an economy. One possibility is that the nature of manufacturing production might be
cleaner or less brawn intensive for countries that industrialize in the 20th century relatively
to developed economies that went through the transition in the 19th century. For example,
industrialization could be associated with an increased demand for fine motor skills (in which
women have a comparative advantage), as it is the case with electronics in Asia. Alternatively,
in some countries, as it is the case in India, the process of economic development could
be associated with the expansion of the service economy were women have a comparative
advantage. In either case industrialization would generate an increase in women’s relative
wages that, by counteracting the income effect for married women, could potentially lead to
23

The results of a series of non-parametric regressions show that female labor supply is U-shaped in all
decades. For the pre-1980 period, the estimates are not statistically significant, this is due to sample imbalance:
There are fewer observations for the earlier years and they are skewed toward relatively richer economies.
24
Mammen and Paxson (2000, Figure 2) show a similar pattern for a panel of 90 countries observed in 1970,
1975, 1980, and 1985.

a smaller drop in female labor supply with economic development.25
Before turning to the sectoral analysis, it is interesting to study the interplay between
income, occupational composition and women’s participation to the labor market. Goldin
(1995) suggests that one reason for the existence of a U-shaped female labor supply function is
the relationship between female education, increased white-collar employment and economic
development. At low levels of economic development, education increases for males far more
than for females, and women are under-represented in the clerical sector. Goldin argues
that women’s absence as clerical workers might be driven by the fact that their education
levels are low, not just relative to men’s, when the difference in education is highest. This
conjecture finds support in the data (see Table 1, Goldin, 1995, pg. 77). Table 5 reproduces
this analysis for the sub-sample of countries for which ILO data on occupation are available
(see data appendix for details). The results confirm Goldin’s findings. The ratio of femaleto-male clerical workers is positively correlated with the percentage of women with secondary
education and negatively correlated with the ratio of male to female total years of education.
As pointed out by Goldin (1995, pg. 74) this is consistent with Boserup’s observation that
competition from men serves to force women out of clerical employment. The coefficient on
female education looses significance once we control for country effects, indicating that the
level of female education is an important determinant of cross-country differences in womens
work outcomes.

Gender and structural transformation

The relationship between the process of structural transformation and women’s involvement
in the labor market has been noted by several authors, especially in relation to the increasing
importance of the service sector in the economy. The idea is that production of goods is
relatively intensive in the use of ‘brawn’ while the production of services is relatively intensive
in the use of ‘brain’. Since men and women may have different endowments of these factors,
with women having a comparative advantage in ‘brain’ activities, the historical growth in the
service sector may impact female participation in the labor market.
Goldin (1995, 2006) notes that service jobs tend to be physically less demanding and
cleaner, thus more “respectable” for women entering the labor force, than typical jobs in
factories. Thus the expansion of the service sector is well positioned to generate the rising portion of the U. Insofar the decline in manufacturing and the parallel rise in services
are staggered across countries, this development can explain the international variation in
25

A valid concern, raised by the discussant, is that there might not be enough within country variation
to identify the U in this sample. This, legitimate, concern is partly mitigated by the fact that for all the
non-OECD countries there are at the very least four data points spanning 1990 to 2005 (in many cases one
can go back to the 1980s). Further investigation of this pattern with a longer data series and including a
larger set of controls is left for future work.

16

women’s labor market outcomes. Only a handful of papers in the recent literature have made
this connection explicitly (see Rendall, 2010, Akbulut, 2011, Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2011,
and Ngai and Petrongolo, 2012). All these papers are concerned with recent trends in female labor force participation in economically advanced economies and suggests that industry
structure affect women’s work.26 Other authors have studied the role of home production in
explaining the shift towards services but do not explicitly focus on the link with female labor
force participation (see Ngai and Pissarides, 2008, Rogerson, 2008, Buera and Kaboski, 2011,
2012).
Far less has been written about the transition from agriculture to manufacturing. The
declining portion of the U can be linked to the change in the nature of agricultural work as
an economy moves away from subsistence agriculture. This change typically involves a shift
from very labor-intensive technologies, where women are heavily involved as family workers,
to capital-intensive agricultural technologies (such as the plough) where men tend to have
a comparative advantage because they require physical strength. De Vries (1994) argues
that market production increased (also for women) during the early stages of the industrial
revolution but home production gained importance as female labor market participation
declined. As discussed in Section 2, Goldin and Sokoloff’s (1984) “relative productivity
hypothesis” predicts that the manufacturing sector would develop earlier in agricultural areas
where the relative productivity of females and children is especially low relatively to men (for
example, because of the adoption of the plough). According to this hypothesis, we should
see an increase in the demand of female (unskilled) workers but, based on the evidence
in Katz and Margo (2013), this increase should be limited. They show that although the
share of female workers was positively correlated with firm size in the 19th century, many,
relatively large, establishments did not hire women or children. Moreover, since production
in manufacturing was arduous and relatively intensive in the use of ‘brawn’, especially in the
early phases of industrialization in the 19th century, women, especially married women, were
more likely to drop out of the market.
To date, no study has proposed a mechanism that can simultaneously generate structural
transformation and the full U-shaped pattern for female labor force participation, at least to
the author knowledge. One notable exception, although the link to female labor supply is not
explicit, is Buera and Kaboski (2012). Their theory emphasizes the scale of the productive
unit as being important to understand both movements among broad sectors (agriculture,
manufacturing, technology) and movements between home and market production. Among
other things, scale technologies can generate the movement of services from the market sector
to the home sector, and vice versa. To the extent that the division of labor between home and
26
Of course, supply-side factors might be driving the change, although work by Lee and Wolpin (2006) suggests that demand-side factors associated with technical change are likely to be the prevailing force underlying
these changes.

17

market activities is gendered, this mechanism has the potential to generate a declining female
labor supply, associated with the phase of greatest expansion of the manufacturing sector, as
well as the increasing portion of the curve, associated with the manufacturing sector decline
and the acceleration in the expansion of the service sector.
This is a promising area of research. This paper contributes to it by documenting gender
differentials in the relationship between the process of structural transformation and economic
development, both historically and in a modern cross section of countries. Note that using
sectoral shares to study the evolution of women’s work mitigates some of the issues related to
the measurement of female labor force participation, especially for the sample of developed
economies. This is because it does not require to match population counts with data about
the economically active population.

5.1

Developed Economies

As discussed in Herrendorf et al. (2013), increases in GDP per capita have been associated
with decreases in employment share in agriculture, and increases in the employment share
in services. Manufacturing behaves somewhat differently from the other two sectors: its
employment share follows an inverted-U shape. That is, it is increasing for lower levels of
development and decreasing for higher level of development.27 .
The first column in Figure 4 confirms these finding based on the historical sample of
developed economies. The vertical axis in each of the horizontal panels reports the share of
economically active population working in agriculture (panel A), manufacturing (panel B),
and services (panel C), respectively.28 The next two columns show how this relationship
varies by gender. Specifically, the vertical axis represents the share of economically active
women (column 2) and men (column 3) employed in each of the three sectors. The trends by
gender do not differ from those in the aggregate. That is, for both genders the correlation
between GDP per capita and sectoral employment shares is negative in the agricultural sector,
positive in the service sector, and it has an inverted-U shape in the manufacturing sector.
However, the graph reveals some interesting differences. The female employment share in
agriculture seems to drop somewhat less rapidly with log GDP per capita, the inverted-U
shape in manufacturing is more muted for women than for men, and the employment share
of women in services seems to grow more rapidly.
To investigate whether these gender differentials are statistically significant, Table 6 reports the results of pooled regressions, by industry, of employment shares against a female
dummy, log GDP per capita (entering both linearly and as a quadratic polynomial), and interaction terms between the two. Column 1 to 3 report the results for the linear specification,
27

The same patterns are observed when using nominal value added shares.
Following the definition of the three sectors in Herrendorf et al. (2013), I include mining as well as the
utilities sector in the manufacturing sector.
28

18

column 4 and 5 those for the quadratic specification. As in earlier tables, controls for year
effects (column 2 and 4), as well as country effects (column 3 and 5), are progressively added.
For the agricultural sector, as shown in panel A, the employment shares drop for both
genders but the rate of decline is smaller for women than for men. This finding might be
surprising in light of the discussion in section 2, but it stems from the fact that both shares are
converging to zero as GDP per capita increases. Since men’s employment share in agriculture
is initially higher than women’s, its drop is also larger. The results of the quadratic regressions
in column 4 and 5 confirm this pattern, although the gender differential is not statistically
significant in this case.
Panel B reveals strong gender differentials in the manufacturing sector. In the linear
specification, male employment shares in manufacturing substantially increase with log GDP
per capita, even when we control for both year and country effects, but the increase is much
smaller, by about 8 log points, for females. The estimates for the quadratic specification
substantially differ by gender. Consistent with Goldin and Sokoloff (1982) and Katz and
Margo (2013), the employment share in manufacturing initially rises more rapidly for women
than for men, but it flattens out much earlier so that the inverted-U shape is much more
pronounced for men than for women.
The last panel in Table 6 reports the results for the service sector. Column 1 to 3 show
that the employment share in the service sector increases at a higher rate for women than for
men, but the difference is not statistically significant (at standard levels of significance). The
results of the quadratic regressions (column 4 to 5) reveal the existence of important gender
differentials. The increase in the share of women working in services is steeper than men’s
at low levels of log GDP per capita, but it increases at a decreasing rate as GDP per capita
grows. This is not surprising since the share is bounded by 1 and, in all the countries in our
sample, 90 percent of all working women are in services. On the other end, the share of men
employed in the service sector increases somewhat linearly, or with a slightly convex profile
with economic development (being slow at first and then accelerating once the manufacturing
sector start rapidly shrinking).29

5.2

Full Sample

Figure 5 and Table 7 report the result of the sectoral analysis for the full sample. The results
are similar to those observed for the sample of developed economies with a few exceptions.
The share of working women employed in agriculture drops more abruptly relative to men
(at least for the quadratic specification); the gender gap in service sector shares (favorable
29

Additional regressions using the female share of total sector employment (that is a measure of female
input intensity) as a dependent variable have also been run. The results show that while in the manufacturing
sector female intensity declines as its relative importance in the overall economy increases, the female intensity
in the service sector is positively correlated with the size of the sector.

19

to women) is larger; the manufacturing share of female employment is higher than in the
sample of developed economies at all levels of economic development. Once again, this
evidence indicates that the nature of manufacturing work might matter for the declining part
of the U. Excluding early OECD economies from the sample does not substantially alter this
picture. The most notable difference is that both the female service sector share and the
gender differential grow more rapidly than in the full sample.

6

Conclusions

This paper shows that there is a consistent U-shaped relationship between women’s role in
the labor market and the process of economic development, both within and across countries.
Interestingly, the U-shape is more muted when early OECD economies are dropped from this
sample. One possible explanation is that the stigma towards married women’s participation
to labor market, or women dislike for factory production, might be lower when manufacturing
production is cleaner or less brawn intensive than it was in the 19th century. The paper is
purely descriptive and, among the other things, does not discuss the potential determinants
for the observed differences in female labor supply across countries and over time. However,
differences in taxation, childcare availability, maternity leave policies, institutions and culture
are obviously important.
Although this paper focuses on female labor force participation, there are other dimensions
of women’s status that might not vary linearly with economic development. Alesina, Giuliano
and Nunn (2013), confirm the U-shaped relationship for female participation to the labor
market (even after controlling for cultural differences across countries), but not for indicators
of female participation in politics and entrepreneurial activities. Further investigation using
alternative indicators of economic status, such as women’s rights or maternal health, could
potentially uncover other interesting non-linear relationships.
One interesting avenue for future research is to use the cross-state variation within the
United States to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants of the U-shaped female
labor supply: there was (and still is) a substantial amount of regional variation in economic
structure that can be exploited for identification (see Kim, 1998,1999, and Kim and Margo,
2004), as well as a substantial variation in married women labor force participation and
earnings (Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2011). This could be a promising identification strategy because, historically, for married women the geographic location of the household was
arguably determined by the husband and thus, at least to a first approximation, can be
thought of as exogenous.

Developed Country Sample

There are reasonable concerns about data comparability, especially for the early period in
our sample. Fortunately, for developed economies, there is an overlap between the labor
force statistics from IHS and those from ILO. Data sources by year are listed in Section
7.1.1. Countries for which the IHS statistics are inconsistent with the ones from the ILO
have been dropped from the sample. In all cases the inconsistency was due to compatibility issues between the numerator (economically active population) and the denominator
(population counts). For example, for some of the countries geographical boundaries were
re-designed after wars. The IHS statistics usually refer to a countrys boundaries for the year
the information was reported, however there are instances in which the geographical unit at
the numerator is not consistent with that at the denominator (for example, Lombardia and
Veneto and Austria pre-1890). In other cases the numerator and denominator represented
a different age universe or referred to different populations.30 The next subsection provides
more details about this process. For the years of overlap between IHS and ILO statistics, the
data source selection rule was to switch to the ILO statistics for the first year they became
available, 1950 in most cases. Alternative data source selection rules have also been explored.
For instance, using IHS as the main data source and ILO data to ‘fill the blanks. The overall
results of the analysis were unchanged.

Developed Country Sample: Assumptions and Corrections

Economically active data and sectoral data was combined within the International Historical
Statistics (IHS) as one table (Mitchell, 1998 a,b,c). The following set of notes are thus
relevant for both the analyses on overall labor force participation and sectoral shares. The
sector classification in agriculture, manufacturing and services is described in section 7.3. The
below list provides all the assumptions and corrections made to the data that was compiled
from the IHS.
Economically Active Population - Europe
• France: For the male population, the year 1866 was listed twice. It was assumed that
the second 1866 was meant to be 1886 based on the corresponding year listed for women.
• Germany: East and West Germany were combined in the IHS for consistency with the
other data sources.
– Observation for the period 1882 to 1939 Germany includes statistics for the area
considered part of Germany from 1882-1939.
– East Germany includes statistics for the respective territory from 1946-1971. Only
years 1960 and 1971 include statistics for East Berlin.
– West Germany includes statistics for the respective territory from 1946-1980. Only
years 1961,1970, and 1980 include statistics for West Berlin.
– Germany includes statistics for the respective territory from 1992.
• Ireland: Northern Ireland was included in the United Kingdom and Southern Ireland
is listed as Ireland following 1926 to be consistent with how the ILO reports data for
Ireland.
Total Population - Europe
• Denmark: From the second line for the year 1921 and below, Schleswig, which was
acquired in that year, is included. In Stata, everything above the second line of 1921 is
under the country ”Denmark-S”
• Germany:
– Germany: Areas ceded to Germany by Austria, Denmark, and France in 1860-1871
are excluded until 1864.

– Germany: From 1910 the territories ceded after World War I are excluded.
– East Germany: Statistics include East Berlin
– West Germany: Statistics include West Berlin The last year following 1970 for
West Germany was 1950. This year was changed to 1987 as that was the next
census conducted after 1970.31 )
• Italy:
– The year 1921 was listed twice, the second observation includes territories acquired
after World War I.
– The year 1951 was listed twice, the second observation and all subsequent observations are for the resident population.
• Portugal: Years prior to 1841 do not include Azores and Maderia.
• Sweden: The year 1890 was included twice, consecutively. Based on the Department
of National Archives, it was assumed the first observation was in fact 1880 and was
adjusted accordingly.32
United States Labor force participation rate for men and women aged 15 and above in
the United States for periods prior to 1940 were gathered from Pencavel (1986, Tables 1.1)
and Goldin (1990, Table 2.1).
Sector information for the United States prior to 1940 comes from author’s calculations
using IPUMS data for the years 1900 and 1910 and 1920 comes from Table Ba670-687 and
Table Ba688-705 contributed by Matthew Sobek in Carter et. al. (2006).
The above data were combined with the EAPEP and ILO data for the 1950 to 2005 period
(see below for a full description).

Full Sample
Labor Force Participation Data

Data for 1990 - 2005 came from the the 6th edition of the Economically Active Population,
Estimates and Projections (EAPEP) published by the International Labour Organization
(ILO). The data provide labor force participation by age group for a harmonized panel of

196 countries.33 Labor force data for the full sample prior to 1990 were pulled directly from
the Economically Active Population 1A Tables from the ILO website.34
7.2.2

Sector Data

Sector shares were calculated using data from the ILO Economically Active Population 1C
Tables. This data source has employment information by industry which can be broadly
categorized into agriculture, manufacturing and services. Data was generally available over
the period 1945-2005 but was not consistently gathered for all countries the International
Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) also changed over time.
7.2.3

Occupation Data

The analysis on clerical work utilized the ILO data discussed above but limited the sample
to women aged 45 to 59. The labor force participation data was then merged with the ILO
Economically Active Population 1E Tables, which contains information on occupation by
industry and gender.

7.3

Classification of broad sectors of production

Sectors were assigned as follows:
• Agriculture corresponds to the sum of ISIC-Rev.3 section A and B. If ISIC classification
was not available, industries were assigned to agriculture if the source table heading
said “Agriculture” or “Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing.”
• Manufacturing corresponds to the sum of ISIC-Rev.3 section C, D, F and includes mining, manufacturing and construction. If ISIC classification was not available, industries
were assigned to manufacturing if the source table heading said “Mining” or “Extraction Industries” or “Manufacturing” or “Construction” or “Electricity, Gas and Water
Supply” or “Utilities.”
• Services corresponds to the sum of ISIC-Rev.3 section E, G-P and includes wholesale,
retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage and communication, finance,
insurance, real estate, business services, and community, social and personal services.
If ISIC classification was not available, industries were assigned to service if the source
table heading said “Commerce” or “Finance” or “Trade” or “Transport” or “Communication” or “Services.”
