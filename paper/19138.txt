Loans for Higher Education: Does the Dream Come True?

ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the impact of student loans for higher education on enrollment, dropout decisions,
and earnings. We investigate the massive State Guaranteed Loan (SGL) program implemented in Chile
in 2006. Our empirical analysis is based on the estimation of a sequential schooling decision model
with unobserved heterogeneity. We supplement this model with labor market outcomes. The model
is estimated using rich longitudinal data generated from administrative records.
Our findings show that the SGL program increased the probability of enrollment and reduced the
probability of dropping out from tertiary education: SGL reduced the first year dropout rate by 6.8%
for students enrolled in five-year colleges and by 64.3% for those enrolled in institutions offering twoor four-year degrees. Moreover, we document that the SGL program has been more effective in reducing
the probability of dropping out for low-skilled individuals from low-income families. When analyzing
labor market outcomes, we find that SGL beneficiaries have lower wages (up to 6.4% less) than those
who did not "benefit'' from the program. We attribute this negative result to the design of the SGL
program, which has incentivized higher education institutions to retain students at the expense of not
securing the quality of education

Introduction

This paper investigates the short and long-term impact of loans for higher education on enrollment,
dropout decisions, and adult earnings in the context of a developing economy. In theory, access to
loans should alleviate the short term financial constraints preventing students from enrolling in postsecondary education. Furthermore, awareness of the future economic obligations should motivate
marginal students to increase effort, which itself should lead to a lower probability of dropping out
and a better performance in the labor market. However, this hinges on the assumption that the
loan agreement does not affect the quality of education offered by higher education institutions
(HEI). In practice, however, this may not be the case. Poorly designed contracts might increase
enrollment and decrease dropout rates at the expense of education quality.
This article contributes to the literature analyzing the impact of access to student loans on
enrollment and the decision to drop out of a Higher Education Institution (HEI). We analyze
the case of Chile, a country which has experienced a massive increment in college enrollment
during the last decade. This process has been, at least in part, the result of public policies aimed
at alleviating short term credit constraints through a student loan programs. Our analysis is
particularly relevant in the context of the recent expansion of student loan programs in developing
and developed economies. We empirically document how an imperfect design of these contracts
can lead to unexpected consequences.1
Specifically, we use a rich panel of administrative records from the Chilean higher education
system to estimate a structural model of sequential schooling decisions with unobserved heterogeneity and labor market outcomes. The empirical model takes into account the complexities of the Chilean college admission system, including the loan application process. We follow
Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzúa (2006), and interpret unobserved heterogeneity as a combination of
cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

See Cameron and Heckman, 1998, 2001; Carneiro and Heckman, 2002; Kane, 1996; Keane and Wolpin, 2001;
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008) for an analysis of the importance of credit constraints in the context of the
United States. Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2008) directly asks students if they would borrow more at a fair
interest rate. Their results indicate that while credit constraints likely play an important role in the drop-out
decisions, the majority of attrition of students from low income families should be primarily attributed to reasons other
than credit constraints. On the other hand, Restuccia and Urrutia (2004) develop an overlapping generations model
and use it to show that increasing college subsidies increases both the aggregate college enrollment rate (especially
for poorest families) and the aggregate college dropout rate. For Chile, González and Uribe (2002), Microdatos
(2008) and Meller (2010) analyze the determinants of the dropout decision. The empirical findings document that
preferences, familiar problems, and economic reasons are the most important determinants of dropping out of college.

1

Using this framework, we estimate the impact of the State Guaranteed Loan program (SGL) on
enrollment and the decision to drop out of tertiary education.2 This loan program is quite similar
to the Federal Guaranteed Loan (Stafford Loan) in the US: both provide subsidized interest rates
and guarantee repayment to the lender if a student defaults. However, the SGL program does not
consider waiver and makes the HEI responsible for the balance of the loan if the student drops
out. We discuss the potential consequences of this feature on education quality. Table 1 shows
the importance of the SGL program in Chile. Between 2006 and 2010, the allocation of SGL loans
quadrupled, rising from 10% of total student aid (loans and scholarships) in 2006 to 43% of aid
in 2010. The administrative SGL records provide information on all loan applicants, allowing the
precise identification of which individuals apply and obtain the loans.
In addition to modeling the sequential decisions of enrollment and dropping out from higher
education, we analyze the impact of the SGL on labor market outcomes. We show that the potential
impact of SGL on earnings is strongly dependent on the details of its design. In particular, SGL
creates incentives for HEIs to reduce dropout rates since they are obliged to repay the lender if a
student drops out. In order to prevent students from dropping out, some HEIs may lower their
standards and shift resources to activities that are less successful at producing human capital but
more attractive to students on the margin between continuing their education and dropping out.
This can have labor market consequences because of the reduction in accumulated human capital
resulting from the shift in the HEI objectives. By merging the administrative SGL records with
individual-level information on earnings from Chile’s unemployment insurance (UI) system, we are
able to present an empirical analysis of this hypothesis.
Our empirical strategy allows for the existence of unobserved factors that influence the decision
to dropout. Not allowing for this heterogeneity can bias estimates of the impact of the SGL on
dropping out (Dynarski, 2002; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2008, 2012) if there is important
sorting on student ability. One explanation for this sorting pattern is what Carneiro and Heckman
(2002) calls “long-run constraints”. These constraints are related to long-run characteristics such as
ability unlike short-run constraints which are assumed to be largely financial. This paper evaluates
the importance of both types of constraints on the probability of dropping out.
Additionally, our model allows for students to select into two different types of HEIs: universities

offering five-year college degrees, and a category combining Technical Institutes (two-year college
degrees) and Professional Institutes (four-year college degrees). We find that there is sorting in
ability, such that higher skilled students enroll in universities and have a lower dropout rate after
the first year. After controlling for ability, we find that the SGL increases the overall probability
of post-secondary enrollment by 24% and reduces the dropout rate after the first year by 6.8% for
universities and and 64.3% for TI-PI. These effects are lower than those obtained with reduced
form approaches.3 Our results suggest that both short and long run constraints are binding.
Despite reducing dropout rates, we also find that the SGL negatively effects labor market
outcomes. Specifically, we find that SGL beneficiaries have lower wages (up to 6.4% less than
non beneficiaries) even after adjusting for individual characteristics, measures of the quality of
the higher education institution, ability and selection bias. This could be the result of perverse
incentives for HEIs generated by the SGL.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the SGL program and the Chilean education system in detail. In Section 3, we present our model of sequential decisions with unobserved
heterogeneity. Section 4 describes the database and presents descriptive statistics. In Section 5,
we present results and an analysis of sorting on ability. In Section 6, we compute some relevant
treatments effects, and in Section 7 we conclude.

The Chilean Institutions

The education reforms implemented in the 1980s created incentives for private agents to participate
in the Chilean education system. This permitted the incorporation of a large number of private
HEIs including universities, Professional Institutes (PI) and Technical Institutes (TI).4 As shown
in Figure 1, enrollment in higher education institutions quadrupled between 1984 and 2010, driven
largely by the increase in the number of universities (from 10 to 60 in the 1981-2009 period) shown
in Figure 2. A second enrollment boom took place during the early 1990s, when the effects of the

Solis (2012) analyzes the effect of two loan programs (SGL and a different program for students from a small
set of public universities) and finds significant positive effects on enrollment and negative effects on dropout rates.
He exploits a discontinuity in the assignment rule to estimate a local average treatment effect for students within
a narrow band around the minimum qualifying score in the University Selection Test (PSU). He finds a significant
effect on enrollment and dropout rates after the first and second year.

The TI are institutions that are allowed to grant technical degrees and PI are permitted to grant technical and
professional degrees that not require a bachelor’s degree.

educational reform seems to be larger as pointed out by Meller (2010).
Though the expansion of the higher education sector increased aggregate post-secondary enrollment, it did not increase enrollment evenly (Espinoza, Fecci, González, Kluge, Mora, Ocaranza,
Prieto, and Rodrig 2006). To address this, in 2006 the Chilean government began providing increased financial support for vulnerable students in the form of grants and loans. Figure 3 shows
the total amount of financial aid awarded to undergraduate students between 1989 and 2009.
Also in 2006, the Ministry of Education of Chile (MINEDUC) started implementing a new
system of loans, the State Guaranteed Loan (SGL), where the Chilean government is the guarantor.
The creation of the SGL filled a considerable void in the student loan market as private financial
institutions had been reluctant to offer loans to vulnerable students.
Since its inception, the SGL has increased in importance. Figure 4 shows the increase in student
aid coverage since 2006. This increase coincides with implementation of the SGL. Annual allocation
statistics for SGL are presented in Table 1. Table 1 also illustrates substantial growth in the ratio
of SGL financial aid disbursements to all other student aid awarded since 2006.
In addition to increased coverage, a second reason for creating the SGL was to reduce the
dropout rates in higher education. Specifically, it was hoped that students with an SGL loan
would be less likely to work and less likely worry about making tuition payments. A number of
previous papers present evidence that supports this idea (González and Uribe, 2002; Meller, 2010;
Goldrick-Rab, Harris, and Trostel, 2009). In Table 3 we display dropout rates for different types of
education between 2004 and 2009. Strikingly, nearly 50% of students enrolled in university do not
complete their studies. This figure is similar to those reported for the US (Restuccia and Urrutia,
2004; Chatterjee and Ionescu, 2012).
To receive a loan through the SGL, applicants must meet certain requirements. They must
be Chilean, score above 475 points on the University Selection Test (PSU), maintain satisfactory
academic performance, not have graduated from any HEI, not have dropped out more than once
from a higher education institution, have a socio-economic environment that justifies the allocation
of SGL, and be currently enrolled at a HEI (certificate of registry or letter of acceptance).5 6 The
5

The University Selection Test (Prueba de Seleccin Universitaria, PSU) is a standardized test needed to access
the Chilean higher education system. It assesses, by separate tests, language and communication skills, mathematics,
social sciences and history, and science. Mathematics and language are required and students must take one of the
last two.

In case a student is applying for a TI or PI it is allowed optionally to the PSU minimum, a GPA greater than

Chilean government sells packages of student loans (which are bundled to be as homogeneous as
possible) by using auctions where private institutions bid on interest rates. The winning financial
institution (typically a bank) then provides the loans to students at the interest rate they bid.7
Once they are approved for a loan through the SGL, beneficiaries must continue to meet a list
requirements which vary by level of study. If the beneficiary drops out from a HEI, it triggers a
“guarantee for academic dropout”8 . In effect, the HEI guarantees payment of a significant portion
of the loan amount (at most 90% of the principal plus interest) to the lending institution. When an
SGL recipient student drops out, the HEI must pay the guarantee amount. If the HEI guarantee
is less than 90% of the capital (plus interest), the government covers the additional amount (up to
90%). In Table 2 we present the percentage of the academic dropout guarantee that HEI and the
government cover.
The HEIs, even when a student is on the verge of graduating, always covers a significant
percentage of the loan awarded to the student in the event of a drop out.9 The HEI is required to
make loan payments to the financial institution until the guarantee has been met.
For HEIs, making students who drop out financially responsible for loan repayment can be very
complicated and expensive. Thus, the SGL creates incentives for HEIs to reduce dropout rates. To
the extent that the reduction in dropout rates is achieved by imposing lower academic standards,
the SGL could negatively impact the quality of education.10 We present evidence that suggests
that this may be the case.
When SGL beneficiaries graduate a different collection mechanism operates: the “state guarantee”. If the graduate cannot make the SGL loan payments (after allowing for a grace period of
18 months after graduation), financial institutions may start legal proceedings against the beneficiary. Alternatively, institutions have the right to require to Chile to pay the guarantee (90% of
the amount due including capitalized interest).
or equal to 5.3 in high school. The Chilean scale ranges from 1.0 to 7.0 being a 4.0 the minimum passing grade.

The average real interest rate of this loan was about 5.8% until 2012 when after student pressures, the government
decided to subsidize the interest rate for all the student loans (retroactively) ending in a real 2%.

A dropout is defined formally as an unjustified schooling interruption for at least 12 consecutive months.

This is once you have met certain requirements, such as the exhaustion of judicial collection agencies.

For instance, lowering course failure rates or relaxing dismissal policies are mechanisms that HEI can use to
prevent dropouts. These measures have a direct effect on the quality of education.

A Simple Structural Model for Dropout Decisions with Unobserved Heterogeneity

An individual’s schooling attainment is the outcome of a sequence of decisions where choice sets
are determined by the education system. When modeling schooling attainment, it is important
to acknowledge that the individual’s decisions are conditional on a set of feasible alternatives.
Furthermore, observed choices will also depend on the decision maker’s skills and preferences.
As a result, simply comparing observed results (sequences of decision) across individuals can be
misleading.
Below we present a model that allows for “dropping out” to be the final result of a sequence of
decisions. At each node in the model, observed choices are influenced by observable and unobservable characteristics. Even after controlling for potential endogeneity in decision-making, selectivity,
and observable characteristics, we may see observationally equivalent individuals responding differently to the same stimulus. This can be explained by the presence of unobserved heterogeneity
in endowments as in Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004), Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzúa (2006),
Urzúa (2008), and Rau, Sánchez, and Urzúa (2011). These unobserved endowments are a combination of cognitive and noncognitive skills, and they can vary considerably among individuals.
The timing of decisions in our model is as follows: before taking the University Selection Test
(PSU), if they decide to study, students can apply for the SGL and then, after learning the test
results, they can enroll in Technical Institutes (TI), Professional Institutes (PI) or in universities.11

3.1

The Model

We model a tree of sequential binary decisions, which is based on the structural choice models in
Rau, Sánchez, and Urzúa (2011). Following Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004) we model the
decisions as follows.
Consider a choice node j (for instance, whether to apply to the SGL). Let Vid(j) represent the
indirect utility that individual i obtains when choosing alternative d (with d ∈ {0, 1}) from the
11

For purposes of this paper we consider two groups of institutions: universities and non universities, the TI-PI.

6

alternative set at node j:

Vid(j) = Zid(j) δd(j) + µid(j)

(1)

where Zid(j) is a vector of observed characteristics that affects the individual’s schooling decision
and µid(j) is an error term.12
Let Did(j) be a binary variable defined as follow

Did(j) =




1


0

if

Vid(j) ≥ 0

(2)

otherwise

The previous expression implies that individual i chooses the schooling path that maximizes her
utility conditional on her characteristics.13 Thus, we observe sequences of decisions with observed
choices represented by Dl , with l = 1, 2, . . . , L.14 In Figure 5 we show the tree of sequential
decisions. In our model L = 6.
Finally, after observing the sequences of optimal schooling decisions we observe two outcomes:
higher education completion (i.e. dropout or non-dropout) and wages (for both dropouts and
non-dropouts). The equation we use to model the dropout decision is

l
ΛD
i =




1

0

if

ViDl ≥ 0

otherwise

where the dropout decision depends on the node in which individual i is. The wage equation is
given by:
Dl
Dl
Dl
l
WiΛ
= αD
Λ MiΛ + νiΛ
12

(4)

In particular, we consider six nodes: the first one is the decision to enroll or not in a higher education institution,
the second one is to apply to SGL, the third and fourth consider the decision of enrolling into a university or TI/PI
conditional on having applied or not to the SGL. The fifth and sixth nodes consider the allocation of the SGL
conditional in that individuals enroll in a university or TI/PI and apply to the SGL.
13
We assume that indirect utility of unchosen alternatives is strictly negative.
14
For instance, D1 is the sequence for students that decided to enroll in a higher education institution, applied to
the SGL, enrolled in a university, and obtained the SGL.

iΛ is a vector containing observed characteristics which also determine wages for individual

is an error term. The observed outcome vector is given by the dropout

decision and the observed wage, denoted by:
Y Dl = [ΛDl

WΛDl ] l = 1, . . . , L

(5)

It is important to mention that the model allows for all of the error terms (νΛDl ) to be correlated.
Thus, schooling decisions are correlated with outcomes through unobservable factors. The model
allows for unobserved heterogeneity, which we refer to as an individual’s factor and denote with
f . The factor represents the individual’s unobserved ability and plays an important role in the
decisions made at each node. With this model we are able to estimate counterfactual outcomes and
treatment effects for different policies, as it will be shown in Section 6. Imposing some structure
on the factor allows us to identify the effect of ability on the sequential choices. We impose the
following structure:

µid(j) = ηd(j) fi − εid(j)

where ε and ξ are error terms of the corresponding equations. We assume that εd ⊥⊥ ξΛ ⊥⊥
f . Following Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003) and Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzúa (2006),
we posit a linear measurement system and use it to identify the distribution of the unobserved
endowments f . We supplement the model described above with a set of linear equations linking
measured ability with observed characteristics and unobserved endowments. This allows us to
interpret the unobserved factor f as purely a combination of different abilities (cognitive and noncognitive). The ability measurements we use are the University Selection Test (PSU) and high
school GPA. To simplify discussion, we refer to both measurements as “test scores”.15 The test

score equations are

Tik = Xik γk + λik

k = 1, 2, 3

(8)

Where Tik is test score k of individual i, Xik is a vector containing observed characteristics (e.g.
socioeconomic characteristics, parents’ education, type of school attended) and λik is an error term
for test score k for individual i.16 As before, we impose a factor structure for the error terms in
the test score equations

λik = ωk fi + θik

k = 1, 2, 3

(9)

where θ is the error term. We assume that εd ⊥⊥ θk ⊥⊥ ξΛ ⊥⊥ f and that the measurement system
allows to identify the distribution of unobserved abilities. We can use equations (8) and (9) to
express the test score equations as follows:

Tik = Xik γk + ωk fi + θik

k = 1, 2, 3

Similarly, we can use equations (6) and (7) to express equations (1) and (4) as:

Vid(j) = Zid(j) δd(j) + ηd(j) fi − εid(j)
Dl
Dl

Assuming that εid(j) ∼ N (0, 1), from equation (2) we have a probit model for choice d. Conditioning
on the factor we have:


Pr Did(j) = 1|Zid(j) , fi , Did(j−1) = Pr Vid(j) ≥ 0|Zid(j) , fi , Did(j−1)

= Φ Zid(j) δd(j) + ηd(j) fi

(10)
(11)

Where Did(j−1) are the previous decisions taken by individual i (if there is a previous decision).
Consequently, we can express the probability of observing a particular schooling sequence Dl for

Pr Did(j) = 0|Zid(j) , fi , Did(j−1)

1−Did(j)

(12)

Hi represents the set of nodes visited by individual i. The structural model depends on observed
variables and the unobserved factor. Given this structure, we can use a method similar to those
used by Hansen, Heckman, and Mullen (2004) and Kotlarski (1967)to identify the distribution of
the factor and the parameters of the model.

3.2

Implementing the Model

To estimate the model, we use observed schooling decisions, individual characteristics, the outcome
vector, and test scores (Dl , Z, Y, M, T and X, respectively). We assume the decision timing is as
described above. We observe wages after the schooling sequence is completed.
The model allows for the existence of endogeneity in decisions since the choices made at each
node depend on unobserved characteristics which are likely to be correlated with some characteristics. The assumption of independence between the error terms and the factor, after conditioning
on unobserved ability, is crucial since it allows us to write the likelihood function as follows:

L(T, D, Y|X, Z, M) =

N Z
Y

f (Ti , Di , Yi |Xi , Zi , Mi , f )dF (f )df

i=1

Where we integrate with respect to the density of the unobserved factor. We assume the factor
is drawn from a mixture of normal distributions which is flexible enough to allow for asymmetries
and multi modalities:
f ∼ ρ1 N (τ1 , σ12 ) + ρ2 N (τ2 , σ22 ) + ρ3 N (τ3 , σ32 )
It is important to mention that this mixture structure for the distribution of the factor does not
imply normality a priori. Given the numeric complexity in maximizing the likelihood introduced
by the integral, we estimate the model by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

One final comment with regard to the factor is that because there is no intrinsic scale for ability,
10

it is necessary to normalize the mean of the factor to 0 and to normalize the loading parameter on
the factor in the math test score equation to 1. We also normalize all of the test scores so they
have zero mean and standard deviation one.

Data

The data used in this paper is constructed from several different administrative records.17 To
identify dropouts we use administrative enrollment data from the Chilean Higher Education System
that cover the years 2006 and 2007. We focus only on individuals enrolled in a HEI in 2006 for
two reasons. First, we are able to merge this data with unemployment insurance (UI) data so
we can observe wages in 2012 (January-August). If we include individuals enrolled for the first
time in 2007 it is likely that a large fraction of them would not be in the labor market by 2012.
Second, in 2006 the SGL was mistakenly assigned to individuals from all quintiles of the income
distribution. This did not happened in 2007.18 Because individuals from all quintiles were allowed
to receive SGL loans in 2006, we will be able to estimate different parameters for individuals from
each income quintile.
The enrollment data was merged with administrative records from the University Selection
Test (PSU) from 2005. From these records we observe test scores, socioeconomic characteristics,
and family background characteristics. Additionally, administrative data from the SGL permit
the identification of SGL applicants and recipients in 2006. The merged database contains 47,115
observations, 33,814 of which enrolled at a HEI. 19 In Figure 5 we display the number of observations
at each decision node.
The variables included as controls are a male dummy , age (in 2006), geographic location
dummies, family size, and family income (converted into income categories with 0 to $278.000
Chilean pesos as the base category) . We also include dummies for parents’ years of schooling (with
less than 8 years of schooling as the base category), dummies for the type of high school (public,
private-voucher, or private), a dummy for whether the individual received a scholarship during the
17

The data were provided by the Budget Office of the Chilean Ministry of Finance.
The misallocation of the loans was due to a computational mistake that assigned the SGL to individuals in the
fourth and fifth quintiles. Political pressure led to an increase in the number of loans assigned to students in the
lowest three quintiles. For details see Ingresa (2010).

These 47,115 observations include only individuals with no missing values. We did not use imputation methods
to increase the number of observations.

base category), a measure of the designed length of the post-secondary program in semesters, years
of certification of the higher education institutions in 2006 (a measure of HEI quality), and test
scores (mathematics and language and high school GPA.
In Tables 5 and 6 we show some descriptive statistics by decision node and observed choice at
each decision node. The sample appears well balanced at each decision nodes. However, there are
some important observable differences at node D5 (enrolled in a university) with respect to GPA
and test scores. Students enrolled in university score significantly higher than students enrolled at
a TI-PI or those not enrolled at any HEI.

Results

Table 7 presents the parameter estimates at each of the six decision nodes and we describe some
results below.
Overall, men are more likely to study and have a lower probability of applying to SGL, receiving
a loan through SGL, and enrolling in a university. Older individuals have a lower probability of
attending an HEI. When they do decide to attend an HEI, older individuals are more likely to
enroll at a university. Also, conditional on applying for a loan through the SGL, age is positively
associated with being selected as an SGL beneficiary.
Socioeconomic characteristics are important in the student’s decision patterns. Individuals from
high-income families are more likely to attend an HEI, more likely to attend a university conditional
on attending an HEI, and less likely to apply to the SGL program. Owing to the previously
described loan misallocation in 2006, the probability of obtaining an SGL loan is increasing in
household income for students enrolled at universities(Ingresa, 2010).
Last, we can see the importance of ability (as measured by the factor) in the schooling and loan
take-up decisions. Individuals with higher ability are more likely to attend any HEI, more likely to
attend a university conditional on attending an HEI, and more likely to apply to the SGL program.
Also, high ability applicants have a higher probability of receiving the SGL. This is interesting
since credit is not supposed to be assigned based on academic merit or ability.20

475 in PSU test score or a GPA of 5.3 for the case of TI and PI.

Table 8 presents parameter estimates from the decision nodes corresponding to the drop out decision.21 At some nodes, men have a higher probability of dropping out. In four nodes (D2 , D4 , D5 , D6 )
older students have a higher probability of dropping out. Geographic region dummies appear to not
explaining the dropout decision, except for students who enrolled in a higher education institution
and did not obtain an SGL loan and for students who did not apply to the SGL but enrolled in a
TI/PI. In the former case, being from the north or the south is associated with a lower likelihood
of dropping out. In the latter case being from the north or the south is associated with a higher
likelihood of dropping out.
Students from larger households have a higher probability of dropping out and higher family
income is associated with a lower probability of dropping out. Attending a public or privatevoucher school increases the probability of dropping out from a HEI. The association is particularly
strong for students enrolled in universities and those who did not apply to SGL. Having received
a scholarship significantly decreases the probability of dropping out after the first year in most of
the terminal nodes.
Program length increases the probability of dropping out for students enrolled at a university
who did not receive the SGL. On the other hand, program quality, as measured by the length (in
years) of certification, reduces this probability for students enrolled in a TI/PI that did not obtain
the SGL. We also see that ability (as measured by the factor) is negatively correlated with dropping
out. It is important to mention that, apart from learning about the effect of ability on decisions,
it allows to obtain estimations of the structural parameters purged of endogeneity due to ability.
Table 9 presents results from the wage equations.22 In most cases men have higher wages than
women and wages increase with age as expected. The program length is negatively related with
wages, which is likely related to the fact that those enrolled in longer programs have spent less
time in the labor market. Finally, we see that ability is strongly and positively related to wages
for non-dropouts, for dropouts from a TI/PI that did not receive the SGL and for individuals who
did not attend any HEI.
Next we analyze the results from the test score equations. In Table 10 we see that men perform
better than women on the mathematics examinations and worse on the language examinations.
21
There are some nodes with few numbers of observations that make us to choose more parsimonious specifications
to achieve convergence.

We did not include characteristics of career they attended for those who dropped out in the first year.

Age is positively correlated with the language score but negatively correlated with high school
GPA and the mathematics score.
Household size is negatively correlated with PSU scores and GPA while family income is positively correlated with both. Having attended a public or private-voucher school is negatively
associated with all three scores.Parent’s education is positively associated with PSU scores but
negatively correlated with high school GPA. Lastly, ability is strongly positively correlated with
the three test scores. This suggests that the factor is strongly related with true ability.

5.1

Goodness of fit

We compute goodness of fit statistics for the model. Specifically, we compute χ2 tests to contrast
the estimated and the actual proportions of individuals making each choice at each decision node.23
We first implement a simple hypothesis test through decision nodes. Table 11 displays the results.
In particular, the table displays the p-values from the test of equality between the model
predictions and the actual data. In most cases we are unable to rejected the null hypothesis of
equality at the 1% level. This suggests that our structural model performs well at predicting the
data averages.

5.2

The Role of Ability in the Sequential Decisions

In this subsection we analyze in detail the role that ability plays in determining individual choices
in our structural model. In particular, we study if there is sorting on ability. To do so, we use the
estimated structural parameters of our model to simulate the distribution of the ability factor.24
Figure 6 shows the unconditional distribution of the factor and the estimated parameters from
the mixture of normals that generate it. Clearly, the distribution is non-standard which suggests
we were right to relax normality assumptions.25
Next, we show the distribution of ability for those who decided to continue studying at an HEI
relative to those who did not. Unsurprisingly, students attending HEIs are higher ability than those
who do not attend a post-secondary institution. In fact, the ability distribution for HEI attendees

first order stochastically dominates the distribution for non-attendees. A similar relationship is
observed between SGL applicants and non-applicants.
The distribution of ability by type of HEI is presented in Figure 9. There is a positive sorting
into universities (relative to TI/PI) . This is consistent with the evidence presented in Table 7.
Figure 10 presents the distribution of the ability factor by whether the student was awarded
a loan through the SGL program or not conditional on having applied. For students enrolled in
a university or a TI/PI, more able students have a higher probability of being awarded a loan
through SGL. This sorting is strongest for those enrolled in a TI/PI. This is also consistent with
the estimates shown in Table 7. Finally, in Figure 11 we observe sorting in the decision to drop
out of a HEI. Less able students have a higher probability of dropping out, even after controlling
for observable characteristics. This result is consistent across decision nodes . Again these results
coincide with Table 8, where the ability factor is consistently negatively predictive of the decision
to drop out.26

Treatment Effects

In this section we estimate the causal effect of the SGL program on the probability of enrolling in
a HEI, the probability of dropping out after the first year, and on observed wages five years after
enrolling in a HEI for students who did not drop out during their first year. To do so, we employ
less structural approaches (OLS and Regression Discontinuity Design) as well as our structural
approach. Given that receiving an SGL loan is perfectly predictive of ever enrolling at an HEI, we
restrict our analysis to impact of SGL on the likelihood of dropping out during the first year and
wages five years after initial enrollment.27

Effects of SGL on Enrollment Decision
Structural Approach

We start by estimating the effect of the SGL program on the enrollment decision. We control for
both observable characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity. Given that enrollment is not a final

comparisons mentioned.

(13)

In Table 12 we present the estimated treatment effects of SGL on enrollment for different household
income categories. Receiving an SGL loan increases the probability of ever enrolling by 15.6 percentage points on average. The point estimate is higher for low income students. Our results are
in line with those found by Solis (2012) who estimate an effect of 18 percentage points for students
just above and just below the PSU eligibility cutoff (475 points) using a Regression Discontinuity
(RD) approach. However, the impact we estimate is considerably lower since our 15.6 percentage
points corresponds to 24.1% of total enrollment and Solis’ (2012) 18 percentage points corresponds
to 100% for those around the cutoff. As Solis remarks, “...access to the loan programs increases
the college enrollment probability by 18 percentage points - equivalent to a nearly 100% increase in
the enrollment rate of the group with test scores just below the eligibility threshold.” Hence, our
results are much smaller than those found by Solis. Certainly the interpretation of RD estimates
must be taken with caution as with any local average treatment effect.
Because people who decide to not enroll at an HEI are grouped together, we cannot compare
within this group along different paths of the decision tree. For the dropout decision and wages we
will have more counterfactual alternatives as explained below.

6.2

Effects of SGL on Dropout Decision

6.2.1

A conventional approach

We estimate the effect of being an SGL beneficiary on the probability of dropping out from an HEI
in the first year using a fuzzy RD approach implemented as Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) as
follows:

Di = λ0 + λ1 · SGLi + λ2 · f (Ti − 475) + µi ,
SGLi = ζ0 + ζ1 · 1(Ti ≥ 475) + ζ2 · f (Ti − 475) + υi ,
16

(14)
(15)

where Di is a binary variable that is equal to 1 if individual i decides to dropout from a HEI and
0 if not. SGLi is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the individual is eligible for the SGL
(i.e. has at least 475 points on average on the mathematics and language PSU scores) and 0 if not.
f (Ti − 475) is a function that flexibly controls for the distance from the threshold.
One thing to consider is that proper identification of the treatment effect with an RD approach
may not be possible for students enrolled in TI/PIs. This is because the eligibility conditions
for these students is a minimum score of 475 on the PSU (average between the mathematics and
language tests) or a GPA of 5.3 in high school. Hence, the eligibility condition we consider (at
least 475 points in the PSU) may be a weak instrument. As such, we cannot accurately estimate
the desired treatment parameter for students enrolled in TI/PIs.
The results the RD estimation suggest that receiving an SGL loan reduces the likelihood of
dropping out from a university by 9.3 percentage points. This is significant at the 10% level. This
implies that receipt of an SGL loan decreases the probability of dropping out by 112%. This is
again similar to the estimates obtained by Solis (2012).

6.3

Structural Approach

We estimate the causal impact of the SGL on the probability of dropping out of an HEI by type
of institution. It is important to realize that naive estimates are likely to suffer from endogeneity
and selection issues (Dynarski, 2002; Acuña, Makovec, and Mizala, 2010). However, we are able
to control for these issues by modeling the decision process at each node in our structural model.
This allows us to estimate counterfactual scenarios and to compute treatment effects of interest
after having purged the effects of endogeneity.
In Table 4 we showed that there was no apparent change in dropouts rates before and after
the introduction of the SGL in 2006.28 However, this simple comparison does not account for
observable characteristics and unobserved ability.
As a first approach, we compute the unconditional impact of SGL on dropping out of a HEI
28

We see that througTIh decision nodes there are significant differences. In particular, for those enrolled in a
university, the SGL reduces the dropout probability by 2.8 percentage points and by 11.4 for those enrolled in a
TI/PI. These are unadjusted measures.

after the first year.29 Thus, we estimate the following treatment parameters:

where ΥSGL
D3 =1 is the treatment effect for university students and ΥD3 =0 is the treatment effect for

TI/PI students.30
In Table 13 we present the treatment effect estimates. The impacts of the SGL program on the
probability of dropping out of an HEI are statistically significant (we reject the null hypotheses that
SGL
ΥSGL
D3 =1 = 0 and ΥD3 =0 = 0 at the 1% level) and heterogeneous. For students enrolled at a university

the SGL reduces the probability of dropping out by 0.5 percentage points. This corresponds to
a reduction of 6.8% in the dropout rate. For students enrolled in a TI/PI, we estimate a 9.2
percentage point reduction in the dropout rate. This corresponds to a decrease of 64.3%.31 Our
results differ considerably from those of Solis (2012). He finds that SGL receipt leads to a decrease
of 6 percentage points for students enrolled in universities. In his data, this corresponds to a
decrease of 82.1% in the dropout rate. This is vastly different from the 6.8% reduction that we
find. Our RD estimates also differ significantly from our structural model. Of course, our structural
estimates are average treatment effects while the RD estimates represent local average treatment
effects.
We next turn to conditioning on variables other than the type of HEI. In order to see if the
impact of SGL on the probability of dropping out after the first year varies by income level or
quintile of the unobserved factor distribution, we estimate the following treatment parameters:
Υ̃SGL
D3 =1 =

Z

E(ΛD1 − ΛD2 |D3 = 1, X = x, f = ζ)dFf |D3 =1,X=x (ζ)

(18)

Υ̃SGL
D3 =0 =

Z

E(ΛD3 − ΛD4 |D3 = 0, X = x, f = ζ)dFf |D3 =0,X=x (ζ),

(19)

29

This effect is unconditional, thus it does not control for observable variables, such as income, and integrates over
the density of the ability factor.
30
These parameters are not conditioned on having obtained the SGL or not. Hence, they estimate the effect of
the SGL on the probability of dropping out in the first year for an average student, enrolled in a higher education
institution, who applied to the SGL.
31
For these calculations we consider the dropout rates simulated in our structural model. The simulated dropout
rate for students enrolled in a university is 7.3% and 14.3% for those enrolled in a TI/PI.

18

where the vector X includes family income categories, quintiles of the ability factor, and quintiles of
the PSU score.32 The ability factor quintiles represent a mix of cognitive and noncognitive ability
and the PSU quintiles are a proxy for cognitive ability. We consider only three income categories
because of the reduced number of observations in the right tail of the income distribution in our
sample.33
In Table 14 we present the estimated effect of SGL on dropout rates for students enrolled in
a university who applied to the SGL by income category and ability factor quintile. Similarly, in
Table 15 we present the same effects but use PSU quintiles instead of ability factor quintiles. It is
important to note that students enrolled in universities from high-income families benefit more in
reduction in dropout rates. When just ability factor quintiles are considered, we see that individuals
with less ability benefit more. However, when we condition on both the household income category
and the factor quintile (or the PSU score quintile) there is no clear pattern. In general, less able
students from the highest and lowest income categories benefit more than those from the middle
income category.
Similarly, Tables 16 and 17 show the effect of SGL on dropout rates for those enrolled in a
TI/PI by income category and factor (PSU score) quintile. There are three interesting results in
these tables. First, student from low-income families benefit the most. Second, students with less
ability benefit significantly more than those in the upper tail of the factor distribution. Third,
when we condition on both income and factor (PSU score), we find that students from low-income
families with lower levels of ability benefit more in terms of reduced dropout rates.
In Figure 12 we summarize the previous results. We plot the percentage point impact of the
SGL program on dropout rates by income category and factor (PSU scores) quintiles for each type
of HEI.
The results suggest that short run constraints related to income are binding in Chile. Additionally, there is evidence that long-term constraints are also important. The reductions are larger
for students with low ability levels who come from low-income families and attend TI/PIs. The
reductions are also large for students with low ability levels who come from high-income families
and attend a university.
32

Quintiles of PSU scores are calculated over the average PSU score.
The income categories are from $0 to $278,000 Chilean pesos (1), from $278,000 to $834,000 (2), and from
$834,000 on (3).

6.4.1

SGL access and Wages
A conventional approach

We consider an RD approach to estimate the effect of the SGL program on wages. As previously
discussed, the eligibility may be a weak instrument for those enrolled in TI/PIs. Thus, we do not
analyze the effect of SGL on wages for students who attend a TI/PI and focus only in students
who attend universities. The specification we estimate is as follows:

ln Wi = τ0 + τ1 · SGLi + τ2 · f (Ti − 475) + ϑi ,

(20)

SGLi = ρ0 + ρ1 · 1(Ti ≥ 475) + ρ2 · f (Ti − 475) + σi ,

(21)

where ln Wi is the log wage of individual i, SGLi is a binary variable that is equal to 1 if the
individual obtained the SGL and 0 otherwise, and f (Ti − 475) is a function that accounts for the
distance from the threshold. We approximate f (·) with a local linear estimator and the bandwidth
suggested in Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). The results of the RD estimation suggest that SGL
eligibility decreases wages by 11% on average (for the LATE population). However, this estimate
is statistically insignificant at conventional levels. When we restrict to non-dropouts the point
estimate suggests a decrease of 5.4%. Again, this result is insignificant.
6.4.2

Structural Approach

We now estimate the impact of SGL on wages using our structural model. As discussed earlier,
the design of the SGL program could incentivize higher education institutions to reduce dropout
rates at the expense of overall education quality.34 Although the Chilean higher education system
does not have a method to measure the quality of its graduates, we can use information on the
labor market performance of individuals as a proxy of quality. To investigate this question we
estimate wage equations and interpret the results to differences in quality among SGL recipients
and non-recipients.
To estimate the impact of SGL on wages, we first recognize that SGL receipt could have an
34

Table 2 shows the guarantee that HEI would pay while students are enrolled. As can be appreciated, this
guarantee decreases along the study period and disappears after graduation. Potential incentives to prevent dropouts
might arise between these institutions that could be reflected in the quality of education they provide to their students
(e.g., easier courses or lower failure rates).

20

effect on two different decisions. First, the prospective student decides whether or not to apply
to the SGL. This not only determines the type of financing that she will eventually have access
to, but also the type of institution where she decides to study. This second instance is defined by
obtaining the loan (conditional on the application). Hence, we can define two pairs of treatment
effects, depending on the HEI where the individual is enrolled:

and

It is important to note that the effects above are conditional on the student applying to the SGL
program, enrolling in a particular type of HEI, being awarded an SGL loan, and not dropping out
in the first year.
Hence, the first pair of parameters identify the effect of SGL on wages for students that applied for
an SGL loan and did not dropout during their first year.35 The second pair of parameters identify
the impact of receiving the SGL versus not having applied for an SGL loan.36
In Table 18 we present the results of the estimation. For students enrolled in a university, the
impact of getting the SGL on wages is -2.8%. This is statistically significant at the 1% level.37 For
students enrolled in a TI/PI, the impact of SGL on wages is 0.5% and not statistically significant.
These results are quite different from naive comparisons of means. For university students the
naive wage gap is -3.2%. For TI/PI students the wage gap is 8.6%. When comparing the estimates
from the structural model with those from the RD approach, we also observe important differences.
35
According to Figure 5 this is equivalent when comparing wages of those in node D1 who did not drop out, with
wages of those in node D2 who did not drop out. For those in a TI/PI, this is equivalent to comparing wages of
people at node D3 and did not drop out, with those from individuals at node D4 and also did not drop out.
36
According to Figure 5 this is equivalent to compare wages of those in node D1 who did not drop out with those
from people at node D5 and did not drop out either. For those enrolled in a TI/PI this is equivalent to compare
wages of individuals at node D3 and did not drop out with those of node D6 and did not drop out as well.
37
To compute the significance we perform difference in mean tests for the estimated parameters.

21

This suggests that selectivity bias and/or endogeneity issues are important.
SGL
The estimated treatment effects ∆SGL
D1 ,D5 and ∆D3 ,D6 , indicate even larger reductions in wages.

Compared with those who did not apply to the SGL program, individuals enrolled in universities
who received an SGL loan earn 6.4% lower wages. The corresponding figure for TI/PI is 1.1%.
These results are statistically significant at 1% level and the 10% level, respectively.38
In Tables 19 to 22 we present estimates that also condition on the household income categories
and the ability factor quintiles. The negative effect of the SGL program on wages appears to be
strongest for students with lower levels of ability and from low income households.
Finally, Tables 23 and 24 show the effects of the SGL on wages after also conditioning on our
measure of institution quality (years of certification) and the ability factor quintiles. We see that
the SGL decreases wages most for low-skilled students who are enrolled in HEIs that are of lower
quality. In contrast, high-skilled students enrolled in institutions with a large number of years of
certification obtain greater wages as a result of the SGL.
The results suggest that after controlling for self-selection and endogeneity, students who receive
SGL loans in their first year (especially those enrolled in universities) have lower wages six years
later in comparison with students who do not receive an SGL loan.
6.4.3

Understanding the Wage Gap

According to the previously discussed results, the SGL program reduces the probability of dropping
out after the first year. Thus, a simple comparison of the wages of those who did not dropout and
received an SGL loan with the wages of those who did not obtain an SGL loan could be biased by
differences in potential labor market experience. Specifically, those who drop out of school earlier
have more potential years of work experience. To the extent that labor market experience positively
impacts wages, naive estimates will tend to understate (i.e. make more negative) the true effect of
the SGL program.
In Tables 25 and 26 we show the cumulative average number of pension contributions between
2007 and 2010 for individuals enrolled in universities and TI/PI. For university enrollees we fail to
reject the null hypothesis of equality of pension contributions between SGL and non-SGL recipients
38
Similarly, uncorrected measures shows a wage gap of -9.7% for those enrolled in universities and 8.2% for those
in TI/PI. This suggests that endogeneity and selectivity bias is present, especially for those in TI/PI.

22

for most years. On the other hand, for TI/PI enrollees, the number of pension contributions
is significantly larger for those who did not obtain the SGL. The difference, on average, is 3.7
contributions. It seems unlikely that this would account for the entire wage gap. For instance,
according to Sapelli (2009) the average annual return to experience is 2.4%. Thus, the increase
in the number of pension contributions could explain a 0.07% wage gap but we observe a wage
gap of at least -4.8% (depending on the treatment effect considered) between SGL recipients and
non-recipients.
One plausible hypothesis for the observed wage gap, is that the incentive for HEIs to retain
SGL students may decrease the retention requirements for students with the loan. As explained
before, HEIs are responsible for the loan (up to 90% of principal plus interests) during the period
in which beneficiaries are enrolled. Thus, higher education institutions have an incentive to ensure
graduation. This may affect the average quality of SGL graduates, which could then be reflected
in initial wages.
Evidence of perverse incentives to reduce dropout rates have also been reported at the high
school level in the US. In Texas, schools are evaluated based on standardized test scores, attendance,
and dropout rates, and cash bonuses are granted to the staff of successful schools. A major scandal
occurred at Sharpstown High School in 2003 where dropouts were misclassified as transfers in
order to boost the district’s graduation rate (Domina, Ghosh-Dastidar, and Tienda, 2010). We
do not claim to have evidence of this behavior in Chile. However, there is some evidence of
irregular certification of some private universities by the National Certification Commission (CNA),
the government agency that certifies universities in Chile. A former president of the CNA is
under investigation for allegedly accepting bribes in exchange for certifying a number of private
universities39 . Hence, we believe that it may be beneficial to revise the design of this loan program
in order to reduce the incentive for universities to dilute education quality at the expense of dropout
rates.
Another potential explanation for the negative effect of receiving an SGL loan is what Lochner
and Monge-Naranjo (2011) calls over-investing. According to the authors, under certain circumstances poor low ability students may invest so much in education that marginal return is below
the marginal cost. However, we believe this explanation is less plausible in our setting. This is
39

Once certified, universities are eligible to public funding for student loans (such as SGL) and scholarships.

23

because we find a negative effect of having the SGL on wages.

Conclusions

The relationship between access to credit and dropping out from higher education is an important
topic in economics. Previous papers have attempted to estimate this effect using reduced form
techniques. However, the evidence is mixed and there is little clarity as to the importance of credit
constraints on student dropouts Kane (2007).
In this paper we analyze the effect of loans for higher education on enrollment, dropouts, and
adult earnings using a unique database that includes information on the type of higher education
institution, credit access, and labor market outcomes. We estimate a structural model of sequential schooling decisions that allows us to control for endogeneity, self-selection, and unobserved
heterogeneity. We estimate the causal effect of the State Guaranteed Loan (SGL) program, the
most important funding program in Chile, on the probability of dropping out from a HEI. We also
estimate the effect of the SGL program on wages for non-dropouts.
Our findings document large heterogeneity in the estimated effect of the SGL program on the
likelihood of dropping out of an HEI. In particular, we find that the SGL increases enrollment
by 24% and reduces the dropout rate during the first year by 6.8% for universities and 64.3% for
TI-PI.
We also compute the heterogeneous impact of the SGL for different levels of family income and
ability. This allows us to investigate if there are short- (related to income) and long-term (related
to ability) constraints, as defined by Carneiro and Heckman (2002). We find a significantly higher
impact on dropout rates for students with low levels of ability from poorer families.
Although the SGL has positive effects on dropout rates, it also has negative effects. In particular,
we find that students with SGL loans have lower wages even after adjusting for ability and HEI
quality measures. This may reflect serious issues in the design of the SGL program that encourage
HEIs to retain marginal students at the cost of the overall education quality.
