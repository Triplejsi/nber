ABSTRACT
We study the effect of the diffusion of photovoltaic (PV) systems on the fraction of votes obtained
by the German Green Party in federal elections. Using both regional and household survey data, we
show that households that adopted PV systems became more supportive of the Green Party. We estimate
that the adoption of domestic PV systems led to 25 percent of the increment in green votes between
1998 and 2009. Our results are robust to instrumentation using regional variation in solar radiation
and past experience adopting non-green technologies. We conjecture that these results are driven by
cognitive dissonance.

1 Introduction
Technology is a powerful driver of change in society. It is well documented that the invention
and adoption of new technologies is

a

(and maybe even

the )

key driver of a country's pro-

ductivity growth. It has also been documented that the adoption of a technology facilitates
the adoption of subsequent technologies in related elds (Comin and Hobijn, 2004; Comin
et al., 2010), and that information technologies foster technology adoption in general because
they facilitate the diusion of information (Dittmar, 2011).

1

However, beyond productivity

and knowledge we have relatively little systematic evidence that technology directly impacts
other social variables.
In this paper, we explore a new research question.

Namely, whether the diusion of

technologies aects political preferences and, ultimately, voting patterns.

To study this

issue, we consider the diusion of photovoltaic (PV) systems in Germany. Between 1998 and
2009, the fraction of German roofs with photovoltaic installations increased from virtually
zero to 3.6 percent. Over the same period the fraction of valid votes for the Green Party in
federal elections increased from 6.5 to 10.5 percent. Is it possible that the diusion of green
energy technologies has caused some of the observed increase in Green Party votes?
Identifying the eects of diusion on green votes presents well-known identication challenges. An increase in the political power of the Green Party may enable the approval of
subsidies to green energy that accelerate its diusion. Such reverse causality logic may result
in biased estimates of the eect from PV systems diusion on green votes.

2

Similarly, failing

to control for unobserved heterogeneity may result in biased estimates if omitted drivers of
Green Party votes are correlated with diusion patterns.
We implement two distinct identication strategies that are not aected by these potential
biases.

Our rst strategy constructs an instrument for the adoption rate, i.e.

the rst

dierence in the diusion level, of PV systems at the regional (NUTS-3) level based on the
variation in solar radiation.

Solar radiation is a valid instrument because it impacts the

return to adopting PV systems and does not aect directly the (regional) increment in green
votes, our dependent variable.

Our second identication strategy uses household survey

data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to estimate the eect of adopting
1

Technology also aects many aspects of life indirectly by raising living standards, and directly by allowing

us to do things that were impossible before (for e.g., curing diseases).
2

The design of the German subsidy system renders this reverse causality argument as unlikely. By law,

feed-in taris are non-retro-active. That is, the feed-in tari for each PV system is pre-determined (for a
period of twenty years) based on the year of installation of the PV system. As a result, current adopters do
not benet from future increases in feed-in taris. Therefore they have no incentive to vote for the Green
Party to increase future feed-in taris.

a solar system on the likelihood of reporting a greater support for the Green Party.

The

survey data permits us to investigate whether the change in Green Party support occurs
after the household has adopted a solar system or vice-versa. Additionally, we use previous
household's experience adopting non-green technologies (i.e., computers and Internet) to
instrument for the adoption of solar systems.
The ndings from our empirical exercises are very consistent. Our analysis of the regionallevel data shows that the diusion of PV systems is responsible for approximately 25 percent
of the increase in the votes for the Green Party. This result is robust to instrumenting PV
adoption by the lagged level of diusion induced by regional solar radiation. The estimate
is also robust to controlling for the endogenous dynamics of green support estimated during
the 1980s and early 90s, before PV systems started to diuse. Reassuringly, we nd that
the estimated eect of PV adoption on the increase in green votes comes entirely from the
small household PV systems (vs. industrial systems) and is orthogonal to the adoption of
other industrial green technologies such as eolic (wind) and biomass energy plants.
The household survey data shows that the odds that a home owner who has installed a
solar energy system experiences an increase in her support for the Green Party is 1.6 times
higher than for a home owner who has not installed one. In contrast, we nd no evidence
that becoming green induces home owners to install solar systems. These ndings are robust
to instrumenting the adoption of solar systems with prior adoption of non-green technologies
such as computers or Internet. The use of two instruments permits us to run endogeneity
tests that fail to reject the null that the instruments are exogenous. From this evidence we
conclude that there is a causal eect of the adoption of solar energy systems by households
on their attitudes and voting behavior towards the Green Party.
After establishing the main nding of the paper, a question that naturally emerges is
about the mechanism by which PV adoption increases the likelihood of voting for the Green
Party.

We present one hypothesis in Section 3 based on the assumption that agents are

cognitive dissonant (Festinger, 1957; Akerlof and Dickens, 1982). In our model, voters can
adopt a PV system and, beyond the economic return of this investment, they may derive
utility directly from their actions.

The magnitude of this intrinsic utility depends on the

intensity of their green values. In this context, agents have an incentive to embrace green
values after they have undertaken a signicant green action such as adopting a PV system.
Demonstrating empirically that this is the mechanism by which PV adoption induces
Green Party votes is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we nd support for two
implications of our theory. In particular, a corollary of our theory is that agents that are
more directly involved in the decision to adopt PV systems will be more prone to vote for
the Green Party. Consistent with this prediction, we document that the association between

3

solar adoption and increase in the likelihood to support the Green Party holds only when
the voter is the owner of the dwelling. It also holds mostly in rural areas, where there is a
greater prevalence of single and double family dwellings and of owner-occupied dwellings.
We explore two alternative hypothesis for the eect of PV adoption on green votes: a
money for votes and a Bayesian learning explanation. We compute the economic gains for
PV adopters and nd that they are small. We also nd that the association between PV
adoption and green votes is robust to controlling for proxies of the change in protability
of PV systems.

Therefore, it seems unlikely that voters are rewarding the Green Party

from creating new income streams.

The Bayesian rationale is that PV adoption provides

households information about the Green Party values and policies.

This Bayesian theory

seems inconsistent with the fact that it is precisely in the `L√§nder' where the Green Party
was in power, and therefore where households presumable knew more about the Green Party,
where PV adoption leads to larger increases in green votes.
Our investigation is related to studies on the drivers of voting behavior.

Deacon and

Shapiro (1975) and Fischel (1979) use survey data from voters in referenda on environmental
issues to study which factors aect the probability of voting in support of the environment.
They nd that occupation, political aliation, education, income and location are important

3

drivers of green voting.

Schumacher (2014) considers similar factors and reaches similar

conclusions with respect to Green Party voting in Germany. Our analysis controls for these
drivers of voting behavior but focuses on the independent eect of adopting green energy
systems on Green Party voting.
The literature on policy feedbacks (Schattschneider, 1935; Pierson, 1993; Soss and Schram,
2007) is also relevant for our empirical analysis. These authors argue that new policies can
create their own support through a range of mechanisms. However, the eects we identify
are orthogonal to potential policy feedbacks since (i) we control for policy changes (i.e.,
growth in feed-in taris) and (ii) we exploit exogenous variation in adoption rates which, by
denition, is not driven by new policies.

4

With respect to the potential interpretation of our ndings, a number of studies have
explored the role of monetary incentives in voting both from the perspective of voters and of
politicians. The existing evidence suggests that monetary rewards are relatively ineective
3

A related literature (e.g., Tjernstr√∂m and Tietenberg (2008), Torgler and Garc√≠a-Vali√±as (2007), White-

head (1991), Nord et al. (1998) Zelezny et al. (2000)) uses survey data to explore drivers (mostly socioeconomic and demographic) of attitudes towards green issues.
4

Falck et al. (2014) is related to the general theme of the role of technology diusion on elections, but

very tangentially related to our paper. In particular, they reveal that the availability of Internet technology
impacts voter turnout negatively in Germany.

in driving votes both when trying to aect the position taken by elected representatives
(Ansolabehere et al., 2003) and the votes of the electorate (Cornelius (2004), Wang and
Kurzman (2007), Schaer and Schedler (2007)). There are not many studies on the role of
cognitive dissonance in political attitudes. A recent one by Mullainathan and Washington
(2009) nds that the act of voting for a candidate leads to a more favorable opinion of the
candidate in the future.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the relevant institutional
context of green energy in Germany and presents the aggregate trends in green technology
diusion and green voting. Section 3 develops a model of technology adoption, green values
and voting. The model allows us to explore the drivers of diusion and Green Party votes in a
setting where agents are cognitive dissonant. Our model also motivates the instrumentation
strategies.

Section 4 presents the empirical ndings, and discusses their robustness.

The

interpretation of the results follows in 5. Section 6 concludes.

2 German institutional context and aggregate trends
The last fteen years have seen how green technologies have become wide-spread in Germany
while the support for the Green Party has increased signicantly. Next we describe these
trends as well as institutional settings in which they have taken place.
In 1998, the Social Democratic-Green coalition won the federal elections. Two years later,
the government introduced a new law, the EEG, which raised the feed-in tari for electricity
produced from PV systems. For example, the feed-in tari for systems with a capacity of at
most 30 kWp was raised to 50 EURCent/kWh (from 8.84 EURCent/kWh).

5

The EEG stip-

ulated vintage-specic feed-in taris guaranteed for a twenty year period (Agnolucci, 2006;
Altrock et al., 2011; Maurer et al., 2012).

6

In this system, feed-in taris were determined (for

a period of twenty years) based on the year of installation of the PV system. Furthermore,
changes in the system only aected new installations (i.e. they were non-retro-active). Additionally, between 1999 and 2003, the government provided low-interest loans for PV roof
installations through the 100,000 roofs program (Jacobsson and Lauber, 2006). By 2003, the
fraction of buildings with PV systems was 0.49 percent, almost 10 times larger than in 1999.
5

The capacity (or nominal power) of a PV system is specied in kilowatts-peak





kWp , i.e. the system's

maximum power output under dened conditions. In contrast, produced electricity is measured in kilowatthours [kWh].
6

However, starting in 2002, new installations received a feed-in tari 5 percent lower than installations

put in place the previous year. See Figure 1.

The 2004 Amendment to the EEG further raised the feed-in tari to 57 EURCent/kWh (see

Underneath this trend there were important geographic dierences.

Figure 2 presents

the evolution of the share of buildings with PV systems in rural and urban areas. While in
urban areas, it increased from 0.07 percent in 1998 to 1.47 percent in 2009, in rural areas it
increased from 0.03 to 4.2 percent. Therefore, the diusion of PV systems was predominantly
a rural phenomenon. Furthermore, since three quarter of the buildings are in rural areas,
93 percent of the overall increment of PV systems took place in rural areas.
To further understand the geographic patterns of PV diusion Figure 3 displays maps
with the diusion levels in 1998, 2002 and 2009 on the NUTS-3 level in Germany.

In 1998,

the diusion level of PV systems was low in all regions. By 2009, the highest adoption rates
can be observed in the south (where global solar radiation is higher), in the north of Hesse
and in the east and the north-west of North Rhine-Westphalia. In contrast, relatively few PV

In 1999, the total capacity installed in eolic plants was seven times larger than the capacity installed in

PV systems. The 2000 EEG also introduced new feed-in tari schemes for electricity from eolic and biomass
plants, though they rose comparatively less than for PV systems (to 9.1 EURCent/kWh for eolic and to
10.2 EURCent/kWh for biomass). See Figure 6 in Appendix A for eolic and Figure 8 in Appendix B for
biomass plants.

approximately concentrated 75 percent of the valid votes, they accounted for a majority of

Equation (7) helps us understand the drivers of adoption. One factor that aects adoption
rates is the lagged diusion level,

Fn .15

One implication of this result is that factors that

aect lagged diusion also impact the adoption rate. In particular, solar radiation in the
region, through its impact on the level of electricity produced (en ), lowers the cuto adoption
cost in (5), leading to higher lagged diusion levels and to higher adoption rates. Since solar
radiation is, arguably, exogenous to changes in attitudes to green parties, we can use the
diusion levels of PV systems predicted by regional solar radiation to instrument for the
(actual) adoption rates. This is indeed the identication strategy we implement below.
Beyond, past diusion levels, adoption rates are aected by changes in the determinants
of the cuto adoption cost,

cjt . In particular, adoption rates increase with the growth of feed-

in taris and with the rate of decline of the cost of installing PV systems. Expression (7)
also implies that past green attitudes only aect adoption rates to the extent that they
aect the lagged level of diusion.

Exogenous changes in green attitudes also impact the

cuto cost (5) and adoption rates in a way similar to changes in feed-in taris (Pt ). Note,
however, that exogenous revisions in green attitudes are orthogonal to lagged diusion levels.
Therefore, the presence of revisions in green attitudes should not aect the validity of our
instrumentation strategy.

3.2 Endogenous environmental values and voting
Our diusion model assumes a xed intrinsic valuation of adopting a PV system,

gÃÉ .

Next,

we relax this assumption and allow agents to change their green attitudes in order to derive
greater (intrinsic) value for their actions.

Setting . Let's suppose that the instantaneous intrinsic utility that an agent derives from
her actions is

In general, the eect of lagged diusion on adoption is non-linear. However, in the initial diusion phase

For simplicity, we assume that initially all agents have g = gl . Agents can incur in a cost cv

attitudes in the second instant, after they have adopted a PV system. A fraction Œª of agents

where, following Proposition 1, the cuto cost for adoption,
(12) and (13), we obtain the expression for the change in

Expression (10) illustrates the main result from our model.

Combining

Once we endogenize the

attitudes of agents, the adoption of PV systems leads to an increase in Green Party votes.
This nding is an illustration of the cognitive dissonance phenomena (Festinger, 1957), by
which, agents change their preferences/values to derive greater utility from their previous
actions. In our context, the action is the decision to adopt a PV system and the change in
values is reected in an increase in Green Party votes.
One corollary to this result is that the more involved voters are in the decision to adopt
(and maintain) a PV system, the stronger will be the connection between PV adoption
and increased support for the Green Party.

There are three dimensions that aect the

voter's direct involvement in PV adoption decisions. The rst is whether the voter owns the
house with PV since renters do not decide whether to install PV systems in their dwellings.
In 2011, 25.3 percent of urban dwellings were owner occupied, while the share of owner
occupied dwellings in rural areas was 51.7 percent (DESTATIS, 2011).
16

Therefore, voters

Note that the relevant intrinsic value for the PV adoption decision is the net expected green value at

time of adoption (Œª (gh

‚àí rcl ) + (1 ‚àí Œª) ‚àó gl ).
13

are more likely to be involved in PV adoption in rural areas.

The second dimension of

voter involvement in PV adoption is whether the building is occupied by a single or many
households.

The fewer households live in a building, the stronger the inuence of each

individual household in the adoption decision. In rural areas, 88.4 percent of dwellings were
single or double family houses in 2009 vs.
2013b; BBSR, 2015).

only 65.1 percent in urban areas (DESTATIS,

Therefore, this second dimension also implies that rural voters are

more involved with PV adoption decisions than urban voters. The third dimension of voter
involvement in PV adoption is the system capacity. Small capacity systems are adopted by
households, while large capacity systems are installed by corporations. Therefore, we should
only expect only the adoption of small PV systems to be associated with the evolution of
Green Party votes.
In summary, Proposition 2 together with these considerations yield the following predictions:

#1 In regions where we observe greater increases in PV diusion (i.e. adoption rates) we
should see larger increases in the share of votes for the Green Party.
#2 We should observe a stronger association between PV adoption rates and increases in
Green Party votes in rural than in urban regions.
#3 We should observe no association between PV adoption rates and increases in Green
Party votes in rented properties.
#4 We should see no association between increases in the diusion of industrial green
energy systems and changes in Green Party votes.

4 Empirical evaluation
Next, we evaluate empirically whether the diusion of PV systems has led to an increase in
the votes for the Green Party in Germany. We investigate this question using two distinct
data sets.

The rst is a panel at the NUTS-3 level that we have assembled.

The data

set includes both the diusion of PV systems and the fraction of green votes from 1998
until 2009. We complement our analysis using an individual-level data set that covers the
diusion of solar energy systems and individual attitudes towards the Green Party between
2007 and 2012.

The set of

The rst four columns

report estimates from specications that dier according to whether time and NUTS-3 xed
eects are included. Time xed eects capture time-varying factors that have a symmetric
eect in voting patterns across regions. For example, nation-wide changes in green sentiment
or political changes in the Green Party and how these are perceived by voters. NUTS-3 xed
eects capture region-specic trends in attitudes towards the Green Party, education and
values, which may lead to regional trends in green votes. Column (5) additionally controls
for time dummies interacted with NUTS-1 (`L√§nder') regional dummies. This specication
controls for time varying factors that are common across the regions within a NUTS-1 region.
We take the specication with both time and NUTS-3 xed eects as our baseline and in what
follows we just report estimates that include NUTS-3 and time xed eects. Interestingly,
our ndings are robust across specications.

adoption rates in the rst ve specications. These associations are statistically and econom17

columns (6) and (7) are robust to including

ically signicant. Based on our baseline specication (column 4), an increase in the adoption
rate by one standard deviation is associated with an increase in the fraction of green votes by
.24 standard deviations (see Table 13 in Appendix D for the relevant descriptive statistics).
Similarly, the diusion of PV systems between 1998 and 2009 is associated with an increase
in the fraction of green votes of 0.9 percent, which is approximately 25 percent of the actual
increase in the voting rate experienced by the Green Party between 1998 and 2009.
In addition to controlling for the robustness of the estimates to regional and time dummies, we also explore their robustness to allowing for spatially correlated error terms.

In

particular, we follow Yu et al. (2008) and consider a generalization of equation (15) where
the error term

is modeled as

unt = œà ‚àó

q
X

wsn ust + nt .

s=1

wsn is a weighting matrix such that wsn = 1/Nn for the Nn regions that are neighbors of n and
zero otherwise, and where nt is an iid error term. Column (1) of Table 14 in Appendix D.1
shows that the estimate of œà is positive and signicant suggesting that innovations in the
increase in Green Party votes are spatially correlated.

However, allowing for spatial cor-

relation of the error term does not aect the signicance and has a minimal eect on the

heteroscedasticity and arbitrary auto-correlation. They have a bandwidth of 2.

on lagged adoption.

19

Hence, we conclude that our estimates

of the association between increases in green votes and lagged PV adoption rates are robust
to allowing for the potential spatial correlation in error terms.
The last two columns of Table 1 explore whether the relation between adoption rates and
green votes diers between rural and urban areas. We nd that the association between PV
adoption rates and the increase in Green votes is signicantly positive only for rural regions.
Furthermore, the point estimate is almost twice as large for rural than for urban regions. This
observation is consistent with the model's predictions. In our model, it is a consequence of
the more direct involvement that voters have in the adoption and maintenance of PV systems
in rural than in urban environments. Other hypotheses, instead, would have a harder time
rationalizing the rural-urban contrast in this association. Take for example the hypothesis
that there has been an exogenous variation in green sentiment. There is no a priori reason
why we would only see that in rural areas.
Nevertheless, the regressions shown so far are not sucient to disprove the possibility
that the association between adoption rates and the increment in the fraction of green votes
is driven by some omitted variable. To condently argue that the estimates in Table 1 reect
a causal eect of PV adoption on green voting, we need some exogenous source of variation
in the adoption of PV systems. That is, variation in PV adoption that is driven by factors
that do not aect directly voting patterns or that are not correlated with factors that may
drive voting patterns, other than adoption.

4.1.2 Instrumenting with solar radiation
We construct our instrument for PV adoption rates by exploiting the eect of solar radiation
on PV diusion. Solar radiation may aect the diusion level because it impacts the amount
of electricity a PV system can produce (see equation (6)). Due to the non-linearities in the
diusion process, lagged diusion aects adoption rates (see equation (7)). Hence, we can
exploit regional variation in solar radiation to predict (lagged) diusion and use this variable
to instrument for PV adoption rates.
Forecasts of adoption based on regional solar radiation are clearly exogenous to changes
in voting patterns. Even if solar radiation and green voting were associated (e.g., voters from
19

We have also observed that our ndings are robust for more general models with direct dynamic geo-

graphic interactions in voting patterns. Interestingly, these exercises validate our current specication since
we do not nd that the additional features of the econometric specication are signicant nor that they
increase the explanatory power (as indicated by likelihood ratio tests).

17

sunnier regions may be more prone to vote for the Green Party), changes in Green Party
votes are not directly aected by the intensity of solar radiation.
To implement this strategy, we follow the diusion literature

Estimates .

The rst two columns of Table 2 contain the estimates of the diusion

model in rural and urban areas. We have experimented with the degrees of the polynomials.
The highest adjusted

R2

are achieved with a third order polynomial for rural regions and a

second polynomial for urban. The

R2

is higher in rural than in urban regions suggesting that

variation in solar radiation is a more important driver of PV diusion in rural environments.
However, in both samples the t of the logistic diusion models is good suggesting that solar
radiation is an important driver of cross-regional variation in PV adoption.

23

Column (3) reports the estimate of the rst stage regression of PV adoption on the lagged
PV diusion level predicted by solar radiation with the diusion models. The instrument is
very signicant in predicting adoption rates. Note that this is the case even though we have
introduced NUTS-3 regional xed eects.

24

This is the case because, due to the non-linearity

in diusion, radiation impacts the evolution of adoption rates, not just their level.
Column (4) presents the estimates from the second stage regression. We nd that the
instrumented PV adoption rates have a positive and signicant eect on the increase in green
votes. The point estimate is in the ballpark of the OLS estimate from Table 1.
20

This claim is quite natural but it is (empirically) supported by the fact that support for the German

Green Party has oscillated over the last thirty years, but our measure of the average solar radiation in a
NUTS-3 region is, by construction, xed.

column (8) for urban regions only.
Table 2 also explores whether the eect of adoption on the increase in green votes comes
from rural or from urban regions. We nd that in rural regions there is a strong and signicant
eect of instrumented PV adoption on the increase in green votes (see column (6)).

In

contrast, we nd no eect in urban regions (see column (8)). This nding is consistent with
our model. The model rationalizes the nding by the larger involvement that voters in rural
areas have on the decisions to install PV systems.

Interpretation .

At this point, it is worthwhile reecting about our instrumentation

strategy. Identication comes from systematic variation in adoption rates driven by crossregional variation in solar radiation. For an omitted variable to invalidate our identication,
it needs to drive changes in voting patterns and be correlated with variation in the lagged
PV diusion levels predicted by solar radiation levels.
Finding such a variable seems a dicult task. As argued above, changes in green voting
are not directly aected by solar radiation. Even if there was a direct eect of solar radiation
19

on the change in green votes, it would be completely absorbed by the NUTS-3 xed eects
included in our specication. Therefore, the omission of (xed) drivers of green votes that
co-move with solar radiation will not bias our estimates.
Some omitted drivers of green votes may vary over time. However, to bias our instrumental variable (IV) estimates, the omitted variables need to increase faster in regions with
higher solar radiation than in regions with lower solar radiation.

25

Again, there is no a priori

rationale for why green sentiment or other drivers of green votes increase faster in regions
with solar radiation.

Furthermore, to fully account for our ndings this upward trend in

green sentiment in sunnier regions should only be present in rural regions.
Let's ignore, for the time being, the diculty of nding a trigger for the increase in green
sentiment that is correlated with solar radiation.

It might be argued that the non-linear

dynamics in the instrument reects the endogenous dynamics of green sentiment rather than
the (non-linear) diusion of PV systems.

26

Under this alternative interpretation, exogenous

shocks to green sentiment endogenously diused in the population causing the observed
increase in green votes.
To rule out this possibility, we explore the endogenous dynamics of green attitudes in
the absence of green technologies by focusing on the period 1980-1998 when the Green Party
participated in federal elections but PV systems had not diused.

27

Our proxy for green

sentiment is the fraction of votes for the Green Party. In column (1) of Table 3, we report

on the increase in

for the period 1980 to 1998. We nd that the lagged

share of Green Party votes is negatively associated with the increase in Green Party votes.
Next, we use the pre-1998 estimates from column (1) in Table 3 to lter from the increase
in green votes (after 1998) the endogenous dynamics of green votes. We then estimate the
eect of PV adoption on the increase in adjusted green votes.

28

Column (2) in Table 3

reports the OLS estimates, and column (3) reports the IV estimates. In both cases, ltering
away the endogenous voting dynamics does not impact the eect of PV adoption on the
change in Green Party votes.
25

Note that the emphasis on the dierential rates of change comes from the inclusion of time xed eects

which capture variation in voting patterns that is common across NUTS-3 regions.
26

A counter-argument is that non-linear diusion patterns have been documented for a wide range of

technologies (from hybrid corn to cell-phones to industrial processes (Griliches, 1957; Davies, 1979)). Most
of these technologies are orthogonal to political attitudes, in general, and to green values, in particular.
Therefore, it is unlikely that variation in adoption rates forecast by our solar instrument is driven by changes
in attitudes towards the Green Party or by any other driver of changes in green votes.
27

This is similar to a dis-in-dis specication.

28

We obtain similar estimates when including lagged green votes as an additional control when estimating

equation (15).

20

In contrast to PV systems, green votes diusion is reverting. This implies that shocks to
green sentiment monotonically die down. Therefore, it does not seem likely that the nonlinear evolution of PV systems after 1998 is driven by the endogenous dynamics of green
attitudes. To account for the increase in green votes, we need to rely on a persistent eect
that builds up over time and that is exogenous to green sentiment. The evidence presented
above provides strong support for one such force: the adoption of PV systems and the impact
that undertaking those investments had in the green attitudes of voters.

Robustness . We conduct various exercises to show the robustness of the estimates of the
eect of PV adoption on green voting. The rst one consists in lagging further the forecasts
of the diusion equation (16) to instrument for adoption rates.

29

The second exercise consists

in constructing a synthetic instrument for PV adoption rates based on the lagged diusion
29

In particular, we use

instead of

FÃÇPV,t‚àík‚àí1

‚àÜFPV,t‚àí1 .

pendix D.2 shows that lagging further the predicted diusion level does not diminish the magnitude or the
signicance of the estimated eect in rural areas.

in regions with similar solar radiation.

Finally, our IV estimates are also robust to allowing

for spatial correlation in the error terms.

31

4.1.3 The diusion of industrial vs. household systems
Testable prediction #4 from our model is that the diusion of industrial green energy systems
should not be associated with an increase in green votes. This implication follows from the
fact that corporations (instead of voters) decide whether to construct an industrial green
energy system. Next, we explore whether there is any association between the diusion of
industrial systems (PV, eolic and biomass) and the evolution of green votes.
We focus rst on PV systems and consider two possible cutos for the maximum capacity
of household PV systems, 30 kWp and 100 kWp .

In addition, we study the eects of the

diusion of large (100 kWp or more) and very large PV systems (1,000 kWp or more) which are
denitely industrial. Industrial systems are often installed on elds. We therefore normalize
their adoption rates by the agricultural area in square kilometers (instead of the number of
buildings).

32

Table 4 presents the OLS estimates of the association between the adoption of

PV systems of a given capacity and the increment in green votes. For household systems, we
obtain an estimate very close to the full sample estimate (shown in Table 2). The estimated
eect is slightly higher for systems with a capacity of at most 30 kWp than for systems of at
most 100 kWp . In both cases, the association of PV adoption on green voting is signicant
with p-values smaller than one percent.

33

The estimates change dramatically for industrial

systems for which we nd an insignicant association between adoption rates and changes
in green votes.
An alternative way to measure the diusion of PV systems consists in using a capacityweighted measure that takes into account the amount of electricity that a system can produce.
In particular, the capacity-weighted adoption rate is given by

4FPVCapac.,nt =

,

We then use

and nally, we use the instrumented diusion levels to estimate the impact of

adoption on green votes. Table 16 (in Appendix D.3) shows that the synthetic instrument predicts diusion
levels well, and the estimate we obtain for the eect of PV adoption rates on the increase in green votes is
signicant and in line with the OLS and IV estimates.
31

See columns (2) and (3) of Table 14 in Appendix D.1. In section 4.3.1, we further show the robustness

of our estimates by controlling for changes in the protability of PV systems.
32

The particular scaling variable is not critical since they are xed and therefore captured by the NUTS-3

xed eects.
33

In Appendix D.4, we conrm that the eect of household PV adoption on green voting is robust to

instrumenting adoption rates by our solar radiation instrument.

where Avg. capacity is the average capacity of all PV installations across all regions in all
periods.
Columns (1)-(4) of Table 5 reproduce the regressions from Table 4 using the measure of
capacity-weighted adoption. The estimates show that the patterns are the same for standard
and capacity-weighted adoption rates. In particular, we nd a strong positive association
between the increment in green votes and capacity-weighted adoption for household PV
systems, but no relationship for industrial systems.
We next turn to eolic and biomass installations.

34

Unlike PV systems, only companies

can aord the magnitude of the sunk costs required to install eolic or biomass systems.
Column (5) reports the association between the increase in green votes and capacity-weighted

35

eolic system adoption.

Column (6) presents the equivalent results for biomass systems. As

predicted by our model, we nd that these two variables are not signicantly associated.
Therefore, we conclude that our identication strategy passes the placebo test.

4.2 Survey evidence
The evidence presented so far to study the eect of the diusion of PV systems on the
fraction of votes obtained by the German Green Party has been based on data aggregated
34

Table 11 in Appendix A shows the descriptive statistics for the eolics analysis and Table 12 in Appendix B

for biomass plants.
35

Because of the large dispersion in the capacity of eolic and biomass systems, we focus on the capacity-

weighted measures.

at the NUTS-3 level. Next, we continue our investigation by using individual survey data
from 2013's Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The SOEP is a representative longitudinal survey
that is administered to approximately 30,000 individuals from 11,000 German households. It
covers a wide range of socio-economic topics including the party supported by the individual
and the intensity of the support.

Since 2007, the SOEP has included a question about

whether households live in dwellings with solar energy systems.

36

By combining the answers

on political preferences and the presence of solar energy systems, we can explore whether
the adoption of solar systems has impacted the political preferences of individuals in a way
that is consistent with the evidence we have uncovered at the regional level.
36

Solar energy includes both PV systems and solar thermal systems. The dierence between PV and solar

thermal systems is that while the latter produce energy that can only be used to heat water, the former
produce electricity that can be either used or sold to the electric grid. For the purposes of the mechanisms
explored in this paper, there is a priori no relevant dierence between these two types of solar energy systems.
Since 2007, a majority of the solar energy systems installed in Germany have been PV systems. According
to BSW-Solar (2014), in 2007 there were 1 million solar thermal systems installed in Germany while there
were only 360,000 PV systems. By 2012, the number of PV systems was 1.3 million while the number of
solar thermal systems was 1.8 million.

24

4.2.1 Baseline estimates
To measure the increase in support towards the Green Party, we construct a categorical
variable,

‚àÜGreent ,

which takes the value of one if the individual states a change in support

from another party to the Green Party or if she states an increase in the intensity of support
for the Green Party between years

t‚àí1

and

t,

and it is zero in all other cases.

37

Our

measures whether the household had a solar energy system

t ‚àí 1.38

We estimate a logit model where, in addition to the adoption of solar systems, the
probability of a change in the support for the Green Party can be aected by (log) household
income, labor status, having a college degree, having graduated from vocational training
school, and other variables captured by a full set of year dummies interacted with a full set
of NUTS-1 regional dummies.

39

As suggested by our model, it may be relevant to account for whether households have
made a conscious decision to install a solar system or whether they live in a rented dwelling.
Accordingly, we split the sample between those households that own the dwelling (and presumably have decided to install the system) and those that do not own it.
Columns (1), (3) and (5) in Table 6 present the odds that a person who has installed
a solar energy system becomes greener relative to one that has not installed a system, for
each of the three samples. For the full sample, column (1) shows that the odds ratio is 1.4.
The estimate is signicant at the 1 percent level.

40

Consistent with our theory, columns (3)

and (5) reveal a relevant dierence in the odds ratios for home-owners and non-home owners.
Column (3) shows a signicant association between having a solar system and becoming
greener for home owners with an odds ratio of 1.73 (signicant at the .1 percent).
non-home owners the odds ratio is 0.52 (and statistically

insignicant).

See footnote 41 for the results from considering separately these two margins. Table 19 in Appendix E

contains the descriptive statistics.
38

We only contemplate at respondents who do not claim to have removed their solar system.

There is

strong evidence that this group best illustrates the eect under study. Comparing the SOEP data set with
reported data from the German transmission system operators, shows that disproportionately many solar
systems were removed according to the SOEP data, see Figure 10 in Appendix E.1.
39

See Appendix E.2 for details.

40

T-statistics are computed using standard errors clustered at the household level (in our survey analyzes).

41

In Appendix E.3, we unpack the relationship between the adoption of solar energy systems and green

support by decomposing the dependent variable into two categorical variables that separately capture the
presence of support for the Green Party and the intensity of such a support. We nd that both of these
margins are important for the point estimates in columns (1), (3) and (5) of Table 6.

4.2.2 Further checks on omitted variable bias
Omitted variables can bias the estimates if they are correlated with having installed a solar
system in the past and aect the likelihood that an individual

becomes

a green supporter.

Note that the required lead-lag relationship between the omitted variable and our variables
of interest is very specic. In particular, the omitted variable needs to be correlated with

t ‚àí 1 or earlier, and with the agent preferences towards the
t ‚àí 1. In our view, the stringency of this requirement makes

the adoption of solar systems at
Green Party at

t

but not at

omitted variables an unlikely explanation for our estimates.
To further explore the causal nature of our estimates, we conduct three exercises. First,
we restrict attention to households that had not adopted a solar energy system before 2007,
and study how adopting the system over the previous three years aects the odds of becoming
more green within the next year. Second, we directly explore the reverse relationship between
adoption and becoming green by studying if agents that became green were more likely to
adopt solar energy systems afterwards.

Third, we instrument for the adoption of solar

systems by using information on prior adoption of other non-green technologies such as
computers or the Internet.

Solar system adoption . As we have argued above, the likelihood that an omitted variable
drives our estimates diminishes as the temporal requirements (on the omitted variable)
become more stringent. To minimize the chances of omitted variable bias, we narrow the
period over which individuals have adopted the solar energy systems.

In particular, we

restrict attention to agents that had not installed a solar system before 2008, and consider

26

as independent variable

‚àÜSolar(t‚àí3:t‚àí1)

which measures whether the individual adopted a

solar system over the previous three years.

42

Columns (2), (4) and (6) of Table 6 show the estimates for the odds of changing the
Green Party support for those that adopted a solar energy system during the previous three
years vs. those that did not. We nd that home owners that installed a solar energy system
over the previous one to three years are 56 percent more likely to increase their support for
the Green Party than those that did not install one. This estimate is statistically signicant
at the 5 percent level. As in column (5) of Table 6, we nd no signicant eect for non-home
owners.

Reverse causation .

One possible explanation of the survey evidence presented so far is

that it results from reverse causation. That is, agents that experience exogenous increases
in support for the Green Party become more prone to adopt solar energy systems. Next, we
directly explore this hypothesis. Our dependent variable,

‚àÜSolart ,

takes the value of 1 if

the individual lived in a dwelling where a solar system has been installed between year
and

t.

t‚àí1

As before we restrict attention to dwellings that did not have a system in 2007. We

consider two independent variables.
Green Party in year

t ‚àí 1,

Greent‚àí1

and zero otherwise.

is 1 if the respondent claims to support the

‚àÜGreen(t‚àí3:t‚àí1)

is a categorical variable that

is 1 if the individual moved to support the Green Party or if she increased the strength of
the support for the Green Party over the previous three years, and zero otherwise.
Table 7 reports odds ratios from the logit regression.

43

In columns (1), (3) and (5) of

Table 7 we see that Green Party supporters are not more likely to adopt solar systems than
those who do not support the Green Party. Columns (2), (4) and (6) of Table 7 illustrate
that individuals who became greener also are not more likely to install solar energy systems
than those who did not become greener in a previous three-year period.

These ndings

suggest that greater green support does not increase the likelihood of adopting solar energy
systems.

The relevance of this conclusion goes beyond the assurance it provides us that

reverse causation is not driving our estimates. Because many omitted variable bias operate
through variables that proxy for green sentiment, the fact that green sentiment itself (or at
least the best available measure) does not drive solar systems adoption renders implausible
most omitted variable concerns.

Instrumenting for solar energy adoption .

The nal exercise we conduct to assess the

causal interpretation of the relationship between solar system adoption and green support is
42

Conditioning on not having a system is relevant to prevent a downward bias in the estimates because

for those that initially had a system, the independent variable is always 0, and the dependent can be either
0 or 1, forcing either a negative association or no association at all. Since SOEP started to ask households
about solar energy systems only in 2007, we consider a 1-year adoption interval for 2008, a 2-year interval
for 2009 and a 3-year interval afterwards.
43

Our results are robust to lagging

an IV estimation. Following the literature on technology adoption,

44

we exploit the idea that

some agents have a higher propensity to adopt all sorts of technologies, probably because they
have lower adoption costs or derive a higher for novelties. This intrinsic propensity to adoption produces a cross-technology correlation in adoption across technologies at the individual
level that may help us construct an instrument for solar system adoption. In particular, our
instrument will be based on whether an agent adopted other non-green technologies (e.g.,
PCs and Internet) in the past. Because these (prior) technologies are non-green in nature,
their adoption decision should be orthogonal to the agent's green sentiment, ensuring the
exogeneity of our instrument.

There are two further considerations that should increase

our condence in the exogeneity of the variation introduced by our instrument. First, by
using as dependent variable the increment in green sentiment (‚àÜGreent ), our estimates only
reect changes in green attitudes that took place after the solar system was installed. Second, our regressions control for other potential drivers of green attitudes such as education,
employment status and income.
We use information in SOEP to determine whether individuals have an Internet connection in the dwelling

(Internett‚àí1 )

and a personal computer

(P Ct‚àí1 ).

that our instruments are, ex-post, not endogenous to changes in green voting. The p-value of the Hansen J

In Appendix E.4, we show that for the full sample that includes home owners and non-home owners,

the eect is signicant for the probit and the two-stage least squares estimation (column (1), (2) and (3) in
Table 21) but not for bi-probit (column (4) and (5) in Table 21). There is no eect for non-home owners
(see Appendix E.4, Table 22 column (1) for the probit estimation and columns (2) and (3) for the two-stage
least squares estimation).

29

In summary, the survey evidence has shown that individuals that adopted solar energy
systems were more likely to develop a stronger support for the Green Party. By validating
the details of the mechanism we have hypothesized above, the survey evidence reinforces a
causal interpretation of the regional evidence.

5 Interpretation
After showing that the adoption of PV systems has been a signicant driver of the increase
in Green Party votes observed in Germany between 1998 and 2009, it is natural to explore
what mechanisms drive this eect. An empirical demonstration of the mechanisms that are
responsible is beyond the scope of our paper. Our more modest goal is to speculate about
the plausibility of some candidate mechanisms in the light of our data.
We consider three hypotheses. The rst is whether voters reward the Green Party for the
monetary transfers that may come with the installation of PV systems. The second possible
hypothesis is based on Bayesian learning about the Green Party. Specically, agents that
adopt a PV system may be more prone to discover that the Green Party proposals are not
unreasonable and this information may induce them to vote for the Green Party in the
federal elections. A third hypothesis, we have already discussed, is that agents are cognitive
dissonant and that, after adopting PV systems, they increase their appreciation for green
values/actions to maximize the utility from their past actions.

5.1 Votes for money
The Green Party was the key proponent of the feed-in tari scheme, EEG, implemented in
2000. The EEG was signicantly more generous than the previous scheme (see Figure 1).
Agents that adopted PV systems after 2000 may have voted for the Green Party in subsequent
elections to reward the party for the income they accrued by selling the electricity they
produced at the higher taris.
If the eect of PV adoption on green votes is driven by the protability of PV systems,
controlling for changes in protability should render insignicant the coecient of lagged
PV diusion. Furthermore, if the variation in the instrument is contaminated by changes
in protability, we should see a signicant decline in the second stage coecient once we
control for changes in the protability of PV system adoption.
We measure changes in protability by the growth rate of the feed-in tari interacted
with the average solar radiation of the NUTS-3 region.

Note that this measure captures

the asymmetric eect that feed-in taris have on the return to PV systems across regions.

30

Table 23 (in Appendix F.1) presents the estimates.

Changes in the protability of PV

systems do not have a signicant eect on the increase in Green Party votes. Furthermore,
controlling for changes in protability does not impact signicantly the estimates of the
eect of PV adoption on changes in green votes. This is the case both for the OLS and IV
regressions, implying that changes in electricity income for adopters is an irrelevant factor
in explaining the increase in green votes. Additionally, the eect of the instrument in the
rst stage remains unchanged when we include the protability measure as a control, which
suggests that the variation in PV adoption used to identify the eect of adoption on voting
patterns is orthogonal to changes in protability.
We can also explore the votes for money hypothesis by directly computing the net income
from installing a PV system relative to household income. We report the calculations for

th
percentile of capacity installed and full load hours (i.e. solar radiation).
the median and 90
Given the time series variation in the feed-in tari and installation costs, we report the
ratios for four years over the period 2000-2009 (see Table 9).

49

The prot to income ratio

ranges from -2.7 percent to 0.8 percent with lower values for earlier years and for systems
with lower capacity and full-load hours. This exercise suggests that even for systems with
high capacity and installed in areas with high solar radiation, the net revenues from PV
electricity production are (at best) relatively small. Therefore, we do not consider plausible
that PV adopters are compensating to the Green Party with their votes

in exchange for

the

net income they earn from PV systems.

5.2 Learning on Green Party policies
The second interpretation of our ndings is based on Bayesian learning. Suppose that agents
were Bayesian and in the process of adopting a PV system they obtained precise signals about
49

The calculations details are explained in Appendix F.2.

31

the plausibility of the Green Party proposals.

In that case, PV adopters would update

upwards their prior on the value of the Green Party vis-√†-vis the rest of the parties, and they
would be more prone to vote for the Green Party in the next elections.

Note that under

this interpretation, adopters do not change their preferences. They just gather additional
information that reduces the uncertainty they have about the value of the Green Party and
of their policies.
We explore the relevance of this hypothesis by studying how the eect of PV adoption
on green votes varies between federal states (`L√§nder') where the Green Party was in power
and those where it was not. One feature of Bayesian learning is that the marginal eect on
the posterior of a given signal diminishes with the information the agent has (i.e. with the
precision of the prior). It is reasonable to assume that voters in federal states that in 1998
had been ruled by the Green Party, had more precise priors about the Green Party than
those in federal states where the Green Party had not ruled. Therefore, if our ndings are
driven by Bayesian learning, we should expect a smaller eect of PV system adoption on
green voting in federal states where the Green Party had ruled.
Table 10 evaluates this prediction by introducing an additional regressor in our baseline
specication which is an interaction between the adoption rate of PV systems and a dummy
that equals one if the Green Party had been in a governing coalition in the NUTS-1 regions
before 1998. The rst column reports the OLS estimates and the second the IV estimates.
In both cases, the dierential eect of adoption on green voting is not signicantly smaller
in regions where the Green Party was in power through 1998.
We have conducted a similar exercise for the survey data in SOEP by introducing an
interaction of

Solart‚àí1

or

4Solart‚àí3:t‚àí1

with the

GreenLaender

dummy. The coecient of

this interactions is insignicant, pointing in the same direction of the regional regressions
reported in Table 10. Therefore it does not seem likely that the eect that PV adoption has
on the propensity to vote for the Green Party is due to a Bayesian updating process.

5.3 Cognitive Dissonance
Finally, the third hypothesis is that agents are cognitive dissonant. To experience a greater
utility from past PV adoption decisions, they change their appreciation for green actions.
This change in green sentiment is also reected in an increased likelihood to vote for the
Green Party.
In our empirical analysis, we have uncovered evidence that is consistent with this hypothesis. In particular, the facts that the adoption of PV systems increases the likelihood
of voting for the Green Party votes only in rural areas, and in owner-occupied dwellings

are predictions of the cognitive dissonance model presented in Section 3. However, further
analysis is necessary to prove that the eects of PV adoption on voting patterns that we
have uncovered in this paper are indeed a consequence of cognitive dissonant behavior.

6 Conclusions
In this paper we have empirically explored a new hypothesis. Namely, whether the adoption
of technologies may change the political preferences and the voting behavior of citizens.
Focusing on the diusion of PV systems in Germany, we have found evidence of a causal
eect of PV system adoption on the increase in the share of valid votes for the Green
Party.

Our estimates indicate that this eect is signicant, accounting for approximately

25 percent of the increase in the share of votes experienced by the Green Party between the
federal elections of 1998 and 2009.
Our study has not intended to demonstrate the mechanism that drives this eect. However, we have informally explored the plausibility of three possible hypotheses.

We have

found evidence against the votes for money and Bayesian learning hypotheses.

We have

found indirect evidence consistent with a cognitive dissonance interpretation, formalized by
our model.

Finding direct evidence that the adoption of PV systems induces agents to

strengthen their anity with green values would be an important step we leave for future
research.

33

There are a number of relevant questions that our study motivates. Do we see similar
eects of the diusion of PV systems in other countries?

In Spain, for example, green

parties continued to be irrelevant despite the large diusion of PV systems. However, unlike
Germany, in Spain most of the PV systems installed were industrial, and households have
not yet adopted solar systems in a signicant way.

In addition to voting patterns, does

the diusion of technology aect other political phenomena such as campaign contributions,
party aliation, civic involvement in politics, etc. Finally, are there other technologies whose
adoption trigger other changes in values and actions?
We consider that our ndings are relevant for various literatures. First, they contribute
to the literature on drivers of voting behavior. Traditionally, political scientists have focused
on socio-economic factors  such as race, income, occupation, education level, and civil
status  as well as on political campaign strategies  such as total spending, endorsements,
aggressiveness of the message, party position on key issues, etc.

Our ndings show the

relevance of another type of drivers that are related to signicant decisions/actions taken by
the voters in the past.
Our ndings also suggest that the adoption of new technologies have broader implications
than those traditionally explored in the literature. Studies on the consequences on technology
diusion have tended to focus on variables such as productivity, wages, employment and
inequality.

Our analysis opens the possibility that the adoption of technology aects the

values and preferences of adopters. Changes in adopters values may have consequences for a
variety of settings. Here we have focused on voting behavior. But it may be possible to think
of impacts in education decisions, labor force participation, crime, health care expenditures,
disease prevention, group formation, or driving behavior to name a few.

Figure 7 illustrates the diusion of eolic systems. By 1998, there were already signicant
regional dierences in the diusion of eolic systems. Some northern regions such as Dithmarschen, Schleswig-Holstein, (0.32 wind mills per agricultural sqkm) and Hamburg (0.36)
had considerable diusion of eolic systems. In contrast, 48 percent of the regions  many
of them in Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg  had no eolic system installed. In 2009, these
dierences prevailed. The regions with highest diusion levels of eolic systems were Emden,
Lower Saxony, (0.94 wind mills per sqkm) and Bremerhaven, Bremen, (0.94). The share of
regions without eolic systems installed dropped to 24 percent, and these are concentrated in
Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-W√ºrttemberg.

D.2 Robustness lagging the predicted diusion level by two periods
This section contains a robustness check of the eect of PV adoption on green voting. Here,
we lag further the forecasts of the diusion equation (16) to instrument for adoption rates.
In particular, we use

FÃÇPV,t‚àí2‚àók‚àí1

instead of

FÃÇPV,t‚àík‚àí1

to instrument for

‚àÜFPV,t‚àí1 .

Table 15

shows that lagging further the predicted diusion level does not diminish the magnitude or
the signicance of the estimated eect for rural areas.

D.3 Robustness synthetic instrument
This section contains another robustness check of the eect of PV adoption on green voting.
We rank the NUTS-3 regions according to their average solar radiation. Then, we compute
the synthetic diusion level of a region,

FPV, synthetic,t‚àík‚àí1 ,

by taking the average value of

FPV,t‚àík‚àí1 , in the four regions that are closest in the solar radiation ranking. We
then use FPV, synthetic,t‚àík‚àí1 to instrument for ‚àÜFPV,t‚àí1 ,. FPV, synthetic,t‚àík‚àí1 , is, by denition,
exogenous to variation in the adoption rate ‚àÜFPV,t‚àí1 in region i. Finally, we use the instrudiusion,

mented adoption rate to estimate the impact of adoption on green votes. Table 16 shows
that the synthetic instrument predicts diusion levels well and the estimate we obtain for
the eect of PV adoption rates on the increase in green votes is signicant and in line with
the OLS and IV estimates.

of green votes using synthetic instrument.

D.4 Industrial vs. household systems
In this section, we conrm that the eect of household PV adoption on green voting is robust
to instrumenting adoption rates by our solar radiation instrument. We consider two possible
cutos for the maximum capacity of household PV systems, 30 kWp and 100 kWp .

Column (1) in Table 17 shows the estimates of the diusion model (equation 16) with

E.1 Removed PV systems
We exclude respondents who claim that they have removed a PV system. Figure 10 compares
the fraction of respondents who state that they removed a solar system in the SOEP data
set and those in the full sample of PV systems by transmission system operator. The gure
illustrates that, according to the SOEP data set, disproportionately many systems were

E.2 Details on controls
All SOEP estimations include the following controls:

‚Ä¢

A dummy for vocational education.

The dummy is set to one if the respondent

states that she completed one of the following (zero otherwise): Lehre (Apprenticeship), Berufsfachschule, Gesundheitswesen (Vocational School), Schule Gesundheitswesen (bis 99) (Health Care School), Fachschule, Meister (Technical School), Beamtenausbildung (Civil Service Training), Sonstiger Abschluss (Other Training).

‚Ä¢

A dummy for college education. The dummy is set to one if the respondent states that
she completed one of the following (zero otherwise): Fachhochschule (Technical College), Universit√§t, TH (University, Technical College), Hochschule im Ausland (College
Not In Germany), Ingenieur-, Fachschule (Ost) (Engineering, Technical School (East)),
Hochschule (Ost) (University (East)).

‚Ä¢

A dummy for labor status. The dummy is set to one if the respondent states that she
has a job (zero otherwise), in SOEP wording: Working (Working).

E.3 Presence vs. intensity of support for the Green Party
In this section, we conrm that the presence of support for the Green Party and the intensity
of support for the Green Party are higher for solar adopters than for non-adopters. We dene

‚àÜGreenSwitcht

to be one if the individual states a change in support from another party to

the Green Party between years

t‚àí1

and

t

and it is zero in all other cases.

‚àÜGreenIntenst

is one if the individual states an increase in the intensity of support for the Green Party
between years

t‚àí1

and

t

(and zero in all other cases). In column (3) of Table 20, we show

that under home owners the odds of becoming green are 1.4 times higher for solar adopters
than for non adopters. Similarly, in column (4) of Table 20, we illustrate that under homeowners the odds of increasing the intensity of Green Party support are 1.7 times higher for
those who adopted a solar system compared to those who did not.

See Table 24 for a denition of the parameters in expression (24), their value and source. In
this formula, both the costs and revenues from PV systems are proportional to the capacity
of the PV system. The rst term in the numerator is the present discounted value of revenues
per unit of capacity installed,

51

while the second term is the cost of installing and operating

the PV system per unit of capacity. Because we want to evaluate the economic signicance
of the net revenues from PV systems, we scale them by the annual average household income
(DESTATIS, 2013a).

Revenues from PV systems are calculated by multiplying the level of the feed-in tari
times the number of full-load hours the system operates per year. The feed-in tari varies
with the year of installation of the system. The number of full-load hours depends on the
location and alignment of the installation.

The average for the number of full-load hours

in Germany is 900 hours (Klaus et al., 2010; Wirth, 2013).

The costs of installing PV systems dropped very signicantly between 2000 and 2009

In 2000, the cost of installing one kWp was

We use a standard value for the annual discount rate, 5 percent per year (e.g., Cooley and Prescott

(1995)).
52

These values come from combining data on solar radiation (DWD, 2010) with an optimistic performance

ratio of 85 percent. KEK (2010), BMU (2011) and Wirth (2013) conrm our calculations.

53

8,000 EUR while in 2009 it was approximately 4,000 EUR. In addition to the installation
costs, there is an annual cost of operation and maintenance (b) which amounts to 1 percent
of the cost of installation (BMU, 2011; Wirth, 2013).
We calculate the median and 90
idences in two steps.

th

percentile capacity installed in single household res-

First, we use the information from a roof census conducted by the

Karlsruher Energie- und Klimaschutzagentur (KEK) for Karlsruhe,

53

Baden-W√ºrttemberg,

to calculate the potential area in single household roofs to install PV systems.

54

It follows

that the median potential area for PV installation in single household residences is 37 sqm,
and the 90

th

percentile is 58 sqm. KEK (2010) documents that it is necessary to install be-

tween 8 and 10 sqm of solar modules to reach a capacity of 1 kWp . Based on this range, we
use a value of 9 sqm per kWp in our calculations. The calculation yields a median capacity
supported by single-family residences of 4 kWp , while for the 90

53

th

percentile it is 6.4 kWp .

Karlsruhe is a 300,000 city (among the 25 largest in Germany) with a solar radiation similar to the

average in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria (DWD, 2010), two of the regions with highest solar radiation
in Germany and where most German PV systems are installed.
54

In particular, the census used information on the roof inclination, area, orientation and solar radiation to

calculate the potential capacity of PV systems on each roof. The census covered 40,043 residential buildings
in Karlsruhe. DESTATIS (2013b) reports that in 2010 there were 17,631 single-family homes in Karlsruhe.
KEK does not identify which of the residential buildings correspond to single-family dwellings. We assume
in our calculations that they are the 17,631 residential buildings with smaller potential roof area for PV
installation.
