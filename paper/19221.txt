1. Introduction

A robust nding of the game theory literature is that with the possibility of future
punishment and rewards there are many possible equilibria. One interpretation is
that these represent alternative social norms or institutions. Indeed, we do observe
a wide array of dierent institutions both across space and time: political systems in
particular range from relatively autocratic (exclusive in our terminology) to quite
democratic (inclusive in the terminology of Acemoglu and Robinson [3]). A natural
question is the positive one: among these dierent institutions are we more likely
to observe some than others? Are ecient institutions likely to be more successful
than inecient ones? A natural setting for this question is an evolutionary one and one possible answer is that of Ely [25]

3 who shows how voluntary migration

leads to eciency. But we do not believe that historically people have moved from
one location to another through a kind of voluntary immigration into the arms
of welcoming neighbors.

Rather people and institutions have more often spread

through invasion and conict. Moreover, institutional change has generally arisen
in the aftermath of the disruption caused by warfare and other conict between
societies. This leads us to address the question of which institutions are likely to be
long-lived in the context of evolution driven by conict between societies.
When evolution is driven by conict we nd that the long-run favors not institutions that maximize welfare or per capita output, but rather institutions that
maximize state power.

These institutions have ineciently high taxes and state

power and are not terribly inclusive. While these state power maximizing institutions are hegemonic (within their geographical area of inuence) for long periods
of time, these hegemonies are periodically broken with shorter periods of conict
between competing - and possibly more ecient - states.
The idea of history being dominated by hegemonic states may seem a strange
one, but with some important exceptions it is borne out by historical facts.

4 Take,

for example, the largely geographically isolated region of China: bounded by jungles

3

Ely uses a model similar to the one used here, but similar results using more biologically oriented

models have been around for some time. For example Aoki [1] uses a migration model to study
eciency, while more recently Rogers, Deshpande and Feldman [45] use a migration model to show
how unequal resources can lead to long-run inequality.

Sources and calculations of historical data on hegemonies and population is in Appendix 1.

in the South, deserts on the West, cold arid wasteland in the North and the Pacic
Ocean in the East. We nd that during the 2,234 years beginning from when we
have decent historical records in 221 BCE the area was ruled by a hegemonic state
roughly 72% of the time, with ve interregna. Less reliable records exist for the area
of Egypt, but in the 1,617 years from 2686 BCE to the end of the new Kingdom in
1069 BCE we see hegemonic rule 87% of the time with two interregna. In Persia
during the 1,201 years from 550 BCE to 651 CE we see hegemony 84% of the time
with two interregna. England has been largely hegemonic within the geographically
conned area of the island of Britain for 947 years from 1066 CE to the present. The
Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean area as a hegemony for 422 years from the
advent of Augustus in 27 BCE to the permanent division into Eastern and Western
Empires in 395 CE and the Eastern Roman Empire lasted an additional 429 years
until the advent of the Caliphate in 814 CE. The Ottoman Empire lasted 304 years
from the conquest of Egypt in 1517 CE to the Greek revolution in 1821 CE.
There are also, however, two glaring exceptions: except for brief periods neither
the subcontinent of India nor, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the
area of continental Europe were subject to a hegemonic state.
Our theory predicts hegemony only under conditions where geography does not
matter, and we would argue that in the cases of both continental Europe and India
the inuence of outsiders protected by strong geographical barriers was important.
In the case of Europe following the fall of Rome and up to around 1066 we have the
continued interference of northerners - the Vikings especially were well protected by
their own geography. Following 1066 we have the constant interference of England
- also safe behind a water barrier: during this period we observe that England constantly intervened in continental conicts but always to support the weaker side,

and eventually this policy of balance of power became explicit.

ject to repeated invasion from central Asia - protected not by water but by dicult
desert and mountain terrain.

6 Of course China too was subject to outside inuence

It is not completely correct to view England and Scandinavia as outsiders as at various

time they had continental interests and conversely, but the key point is that they had a core area
relatively safe from invasion. In a dierent direction Homan [32] argues a role also for the Western
Catholic church which in Europe, and only there, has acted as a balancing force much akin to to
the outsiders of our model.

6

The exact nature of the asymmetry in the physical geographical barrier is uncertain, but it is

a fact that India has been invaded numerous times successfully from Central Asia, but there have
been no successful conquests of Central Asia from India. Phil Homan in a private communication

- particularly that of the Mongols.

However, the relative size of the Mongolia is

quite small relative to China - less than half a percent of the population - while the
population of Scandinavia was about 5% that of continental Europe, that in central
Asia about 5% that of India, while England was about 8% of continental Europe.
These exceptions are in fact exactly what is predicted by our evolutionary theory:
we show that as outside inuence grows the fraction of time hegemony will reign
decreases.

7

With respect to institutions, as we indicated, states with greater power will
have an advantage over less powerful states. To focus thinking we examine a simple
model in which institutions and incentives determine state power. A key question
is why individuals in a society will contribute to state power?

First, there is a

signicant public goods problem. Worse, given that outside conquest and disruption
is relatively rare, it is hard to believe that military spending levels would stand much
of a cost-benet analysis, so that the good of state power is perhaps not very good
at all. Hence while the public goods problem may be solved by a state run by ocials
who collect taxes, the question remains why these ocials do not collude to consume
tax revenue rather than use it to augment the power of the state. The answer we
propose to this question is that the incentive of state ocials to acquire state power
is not so much in defense of the state from intruders but rather to collect taxes from
which they can consume and to maintain themselves in oce. Roughly speaking we
view state ocials as preferring to consume jewelry rather than swords, but they
need the swords to collect the tax revenue to pay for the jewelry. We model this in
a simple way by assuming that greater state power increases the ability of the state
to collect taxes. Of course a more powerful state enables the collection of greater
revenues for ocials only if the army and other forces of state power respond to the
wishes of those ocials. Whether this is true depends on inclusivity of institutions.

suggests that part of the answer may lie in the fact that the area of Central Asia is well suited
for raising horses and India is not, and that horses play a central military role in conict between
Central Asia and India.

7

Note that geographical factors matter in our argument only in so far as they give rise to

outsiders who inuence the evolution of the relationships between the other groups. An existing
literature, including Diamond [20], gives physical geography a direct role, arguing for example that
the terrain of Western Europe is more defensible than that of China, hence less susceptible to
hegemony. Besides this particular claim being challenged on physical grounds (Homan [32]), such
considerations have no bite in the Indian case. Incidentally: while this discussion includes only the
area of Europe, Asia and North Africa, it should be borne in mind that until modern times 90% of
the world population lived in this area.

3

In an inclusive democracy, for instance, this is not so much the case - ocials may
try to send the army into the streets to collect revenues for their own benet, but
in a meaningful democracy the army will be loyal to institutions not persons and
will not follow such orders.
Putting the paper in context, the idea that evolution can lead to both cooperation and ineciency is scarcely new, nor is the idea that evolutionary pressure may
be driven by conict. There is a long literature on group selection in evolution: there
may be positive assortative matching as discussed by Bergstrom [6]. Or there can be
noise that leads to a trade-o between incentive constraints and group welfare as in
the work of Price

[42, 43]. Yet another approach is through dierential extinction

as in Boorman and Levitt [10]. Conict, as opposed to migration, as a source of
evolutionary pressure is examined in Bowles [12], who shows how intergroup competition can lead to the evolution of altruism.

Bowles, Choi and Hopfensitz [14]

and Choi and Bowles [16] study in group altruism versus out group hostility in a
model driven by conict. Rowthorn and Seabright

[46] explain a drop in welfare

during the neolithic transition as arising from the greater diculty of defending
agricultural resources. More broadly, there is a great deal of work on the evolution
of preferences as well as of institutions: for example Blume and Easley [9], Dekel,
Ely and Yilankaya [19], Alger and Weibull [5], Levine et al

[36] or Bottazzi and

Dindo [11]. Some of this work is focused more on biological evolution than social
evolution. As Bisin [7] and Bisin and Topa [8] point out the two are not the same.
This paper is driven by somewhat dierent goals than earlier work.

We are

interested in an environment where individual incentives matter; and in an environment where the selection between the resulting equilibria are driven by conict
over resources (land).

By combining the idea of the conict resolution function

introduced by Hirshleifer

[31] and subsequently studied in the economic literature

8 with the stochastic tools of Kandori, Mailath and Rob [35], Young [49]
on conict
and Ellison [24] we are able with relatively weak assumptions to show when state
power maximizing hegemonies do and do not arise.

8

See, for example, Garnkel and Skaperdas

[29] or Hausken

[30]. An important focus of this

literature has been in guring out how shares of resources are determined by the conict resolution
function.

2. A Static Example

We start with a simple static model of how state power is determined by institutions and incentives within a society. The size of a society, in terms of land
resources controlled, will play a crucial role in in the evolutionary dynamics, but
as we assume constant returns to scale in land, land plays no role in the statics, so
here we conduct the analysis per unit of land. As summarized in the introduction,
the idea for this model is that state power determines strength in conict, but ofcials determine state power to collect taxes in their own interest. The results of
the section relate state power and welfare to the exclusivity of institutions and their
extractiveness.
There are two types of players: producers

State ocials move rst and choose the level of state

power; producers move second and choose the eort level.
Internally state power serves the purpose of collecting taxes. Specically the tax
rate is determined by the level of state power

together with a parameter

œá

9 The relevant aspect of institutions

describes the extend to which institutions enable

the use of state power to collect taxes.

10

It represents the exclusivity of those

institutions: relatively inclusive institutions, such as democratic one, use a variety of
checks and balances to limit the application of state power - courts, appeals processes
and so forth. In the extreme when

œá = 0 we imagine that it is essentially impossible

to collect taxes because individuals who fail to pay taxes may engage in endless
appeal to the courts. At the opposite extreme when

œá = 1 tax collectors can simply

seize resources from producers at gunpoint without any institutional constraint.
Hence we dene

9

tax power b = œáaO

as the product of the exclusivity parameter

œá

We do not explicitly model the decisions to adhere to social norms that underly institutions:

we refer the reader to the literature on repeated games such as Fudenberg and Maskin

and target state power. When

œá = 0 there is no tax power;

the same as state power. The actual tax rate is given by

œá = 1 tax power is

œÑ > 1;

otherwise as we show in the appendix optimal state power is zero

Producers are represented by a single representative player.

Eort translates

into output one for one. Producer's utility is output net of taxes and the quadratic
cost of providing eort, plus a benet from public goods provided through state
power:

uP = (1 ‚àí œÑ )aP ‚àí [caP + (1/2)(1 ‚àí c) aP

2

] + Œ≥aO

0<c<1

Note that the cost function has been normalized so that the marginal cost of a
unit of eort is 1 and that

Œ≥

measures the extent to which state power is useful in

providing public goods.
State ocials act collusively as the residual claimants of tax revenue net of the
resources devoted to building state power: their utility is

uO = œÑ aP ‚àí aO .
Notice that we allow negative utility for state ocials - implicitly they have resources
so that the state can operate with a decit.

Our results are not sensitive to this

modeling simplication as in equilibrium ocials never choose to do this.
An action prole

(aP , aO )

for a society is an

equilibrium

if it is subgame perfect

when the ocials move rst, or equivalently, a Stackelberg equilibrium. Results for
the quadratic case are worked out in Appendix 2 with a complete analysis in Web
Appendix 2. The economy can be summarized by means of the tax-revenue function

Note that the utility of the representative producer and state ocials are measured
in compatible units in the sense that a unit of utility lost by the producer in taxes
is a unit of utility gained by the state ocials so that welfare

is

given by

The utility of state ocials is

In Web Appendix 2 we nd that the salient facts about these functions are the
following:

twice continuously
Finally,

Œ†(b)‚àíG(b)

is decreasing. Stepping beyond the linear/quadratic case, when these properties are
satised we will refer to the economy as

proper.

We are interested in which institutions achieve specic benchmarks. Specically
in proper economies, we can describe institutions

œá

for which the equilibrium max-

imizes state power and for which it maximizes welfare.

In Appendix 2 we show

that:
Theorem 1.

In a proper economy there is a unique equilibrium level of state power

aO (œá), and it is single peaked in œá; so there is a unique argmax œá‚àó > 0. There is a
unique welfare maximizing level of exclusivity œáÃÇ, and œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá‚àó . There is a Œ≥ ‚â• 1 such
that if Œ≥ ‚â§ Œ≥ then œáÃÇ < œá‚àó .
This says that state power maximization leads to greater exclusiveness than
welfare maximization.
We also have a relationship between exclusivity and what Acemoglu and Robinson [2] call extractiveness. In Appendix 2 we show that:

In a proper economy prots Œ†(œáaO (œá)) are decreasing in œá, while tax
revenues G(œáaO (œá)), tax power œáaO (œá), and the utility of state ocials uO (œá, aO (œá))
are all increasing in œá. 11 For œá ‚â• œáÃÇ producer utility is decreasing in œá and if Œ≥ < 1
so is welfare. If Œ≥ ‚â• 1 the welfare is decreasing for œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá ‚â§ œá‚àó .

Theorem 2.

In particular Theorem's 1 and 2 imply that institutions that maximize state
power have greater extractiveness than those that maximize welfare.

3. Dynamics with Two Societies

We now wish to consider how institutions

œá are determined by evolutionary pres-

sure. To begin, we analyze a greatly simplied evolutionary dynamic. Subsequently
we show that the qualitative properties of this example hold under much broader
conditions.

11

We have not specied a relationship between tax power and the tax rate, but expect that as in

the linear quadratic case the tax rate is increasing in tax power.

7

In our preliminary analysis we assume that there are two societies, that both
are proper economies, and that equilibrium action proles are always chosen. These
societies share the same technology and dier only in inclusiveness
thoughts, it is useful to think of one value of

œá

œá.

To focus

maximizing welfare, the other max-

imizing state power. These two societies will compete over land, with their chances
of winning or losing land governed by a conict resolution function that depends
upon relative state power. It is no surprise then that evolutionary forces will favor
the society with greater state power. Our main questions concerns not does more
state power do better?

but rather, how much better does greater state power

enable a society to do? and how often we are likely to see a hegemony?
Assume then that two societies

j = 1, 2 compete over an integral number L units

of land. Both societies are assumed to implement their unique equilibrium prole,
and consequently generate

units of state power per unit of land,

Control over land follows a Markov process with state variable

the amount

of land belonging to the weaker society. The transition probabilities are determined
by a conict resolution function, in which each period there may be conict resulting
in one of the two societies losing a unit of land to the other: that is

|Lj,t+1 ‚àíLjt | ‚â§ 1.

The conict resolution probabilities will depend on the power of the two societies.
As there are constant returns to scale in land, we dene aggregate state power
as

Ljt aO
j .

We refer to the loss of a unit of land as a

probability of disruption depends on the

behind geographical barriers, but who are equally disruptive towards both societies.
Letting

the probability of disruption becomes equal to

Finally, to simplify the computations, we want to assume that the threshold is
such that a society with even

units of land is below the threshold. In other

words, once the enemy gets a foothold, they have an appreciable chance of causing
further disruption. We make this assumption only for the purposes of this example.
Specically, we assume that the force ratio with

To understand the dynamics, observe rst that when
(L1

or

L1 = 0)

 = 0 the hegemonic states

are absorbing and the non-hegemonic states (0

< L1 < L)

are transient, so in the long-run there is a hegemony, and if the initial condition is
uniform over

each society has an equal chance of having the long-run hegemony

since the Markov process is symmetric in this case.
When

>0

the situation is quite dierent: all states are positively recurrent

and there is a unique stationary probability distribution representing the frequency
with which each state occurs. Since this is a simple birth-death chain, the stationary
probabilities can be explicitly computed. In particular the stationary probability of

having a hegemony is

1 + (L ‚àí 2)œÅ‚àíj + œÅ‚àíj ‚àíœÅj

We can manipulate this expression to characterize the average frequency of time the
system spends in hegemony:

If A0 ‚â• LaO
2 /(œÜ ‚àí 1) the stationary distribution over states is uniform

regardless of . If A0 < LaO
2 /(œÜ ‚àí 1) then as  ‚Üí 0 we have œÉ1 + œÉ2 ‚Üí 1. If a2 > a1
then in addition œÉ2 ‚Üí 1 and œÉ1 ‚Üí 0. For xed  > 0 time spent in hegemony œÉ1 + œÉ2
declines with outside inuence A0 and as œÅ1 ‚Üí 0 it approaches 2/L.
Theorem 3.

Notice that

1/L represents the size of a unit of land relative to the total amount of

land. In this model it represents the amount of land that an invader must successfully
conquer to get a toehold enough to have an appreciable chance of success. As this
grows smaller, the fraction of time there is a hegemony falls to zero.

In other

words, strong outside forces, and a small toehold needed for success means little
hegemony.
We can summarize the proposition by saying that with strong outsiders there is
no tendency towards hegemony, while with weak outsiders the tendency is towards a
hegemony of the stronger state. Notice that the circumstances that favor hegemony
are exactly the same that favor the society with greater state power. Hegemony and
high state power go hand in hand. The circumstances under which we might expect
to see institutions with less than maximum state power for appreciable amounts of

10

time are circumstances where hegemony is uncommon and competing states more
likely.
From an evolutionary perspective what matter is tness - in this case state
power. From an economic perspective we are not so interested in what level of state
power is favored by evolution, but rather what it implies about institutions.

For

this we have to return to the static model. Since we are limited to comparing two
sets of institutions, let us suppose that society 2 maximizes state power, that is,
has exclusivity

œá2 = œá‚àó

at the peak of the state power function

aO (œá).

Without

signicant outside inuence, we will generally see a hegemony of these institutions.
This may be more or less exclusivity than the weaker society

œá1 :

the alternative

society may be excessively exclusive or insuciently exclusive. An interesting case
is where the alternative society has institutions that maximize welfare:

œá1 = œáÃÇ.

From Theorems 1 and 2 we conclude that absent signicant outside inuence there
will be a hegemony that will be inecient and excessively extractive. By contrast,
when there is signicant outside inuence, hegemony will be much less common,
and ecient institutions will persist more frequently.

4. Generalized Evolutionary Dynamics

We are now going to generalize the static and dynamic models of the previous
sections to seek a broader theorem about the emergence and nature of hegemony.
We particularly want to avoid arbitrary assumptions about equilibrium versus nonequilibrium behavior, the number and nature of societies that might compete with
one another, and the functional form of the conict resolution function.
To generalize the static model we allow for an arbitrary nite list of societies

j = 1, . . . , M .

Each society

j

has a set of players

i = 1, 2, . . . , Nj ,

although as in

the example we understand these to be player roles that may involve representative
individuals or collusive groups (in the example
set of actions

aij ‚àà Aij

and we denote by

Nj = 2).

aj ‚àà Aj

Each player has a nite

the corresponding action proles.

We do not explicitly model utility and incentive constraints, but assume rather
that for each society there is a set of equilibrium proles

Ej ‚äÇ Aj .

These are the

proles for which incentive constraints are satised - although the solution concept
might depend on the context - in the example

Ej

is a singleton containing the

unique Stackelberg equilibrium in which state ocials are the leader. We allow the
possibility that

Ej

is empty. Finally, there is a map from proles to state power:

Œ≥j : Aj ‚Üí <+ .
11

Next we consider evolutionary dynamics.

t = 1, 2, . . .
PM

plays an action prole

j=1 Ljt

where

= L.

If

ajt

Ljt > 0

Each society at a moment of time

Ljt

and controls an integral amount of land

we refer to a society as active, otherwise it is

inactive.
In the dynamic example of the previous section we constrained action proles
to lie in

Ej .

We now drop the assumption that incentive constraints are satised

at every moment of time, and instead describe a simple learning process by which
individuals modify their actions and expectations over time.
We start by considering what a steady state of a learning process should be
like.

Two things should be true:

rst, players should expect that today will be

the same as yesterday; second, given that expectation, it should be optimal to play
the same way as yesterday. In other words, what happened yesterday should be an
equilibrium, and in addition that equilibrium should be expected to recur today. In
a learning process, the expectation that today should be the same as yesterday will
be based on having observed that in the past this has indeed been true. Suppose
that we are not yet in a steady state but in fact yesterday was an equilibrium so
that

ajt‚àí1 ‚àà Ej

and today is the same as yesterday so that

ajt = ajt‚àí1 .

model of learning is to assert that in this case that there is a chance

A simple

that is, once an

active society achieves a steady state it stays there as long as it remains active.
For unstable societies in which
function

P (aj,t+1 |ajt ) > 0

bjt = 0

we assume that there is a transition

that puts positive weight on all proles. In other words,

when people are unsure about the future there is a degree of randomness in their
behavior - charismatic leaders may arise, populist nonsense may be believed and so
forth.

13

14

Assuming that the system is always in equilibrium as we did in the example is not consistent

with this formulation nor is the example consistent with the assumption below requiring duplicate
institutions. It is possible to tweak the general model to allow the example as a special case while
preserving the main theorem. As the special nature of the example is hard to justify and in any
case we already know from direct computation that the theorem holds in it, we will not complicate
the general model.

14

This dynamic is essentially a simplied version of the stochastic individual learning procedure

12

Finally, we assume that inactive societies are unstable. Notice that an inactive
society becomes relevant only when it gains some land.

This represents a group

adopting a new set of institutions. We would not expect that people in a newly created society would instantly be in equilibrium: the assumption that inactive societies
are unstable is a simple way of modeling the idea that when a society becomes active
for the rst time it is not stable and there is an element of randomness in the way in
which players initially play. As inactive societies represent potential institutions,
we also wish to allow the possibility that when groups experiment with institutions
they experiment with existing institutions but use dierent action proles. That is,
just because an active society uses, say, a constitutional monarchy is no reason a
break-away group of innovators should not also try to use a constitutional monarchy
but taking dierent actions in hope of nding a better equilibrium.
To make precise the idea that it is possible to experiment with existing institutions, dene two societies

Œ≥j = Œ≥j 0 .

j, j 0

to

use identical institutions

Formally, we assume that for every society

j

Aj = Aj 0 , Ej = Ej 0

and

0
there exists a society j

6= j

with identical institutions.

We will

we must indicate

how land is gained and lost.
As in the example the movement of land between societies is governed by a
conict resolution function - except that now we have to contend with the possibility
of many societies. As before we continue to assume that at most one unit of land
changes hands in any given period. Dene aggregate state power to be
with

Œìt

and

Œì‚àíj,t

Œìjt = Ljt Œ≥jt

being the corresponding prole of these aggregates and those of

opponents to society

We assume that the probability that society

and loses a unit of land

œÄjt = œÄ(bjt , Œìjt , Œì‚àíj,t )[]

j

is disrupted

depends on the stability of the

society and on aggregate state power of the society and that of rival societies. Notice
that since at most one unit of land can change hands each period

PM

j=1 œÄjt

‚â§1

and

the shocks must necessarily be correlated. The unit of land that is lost is gained by
a society chosen randomly according to the function

Œª(k|j, Œìt ) > 0

for

k 6= j

and

that Foster and Young [26] introduce and for which they show Nash equilibrium is stochastically
stable.

13

Œª(j|j, Œìt ) = 0.
We make several assumptions about the conict resolution function
First we assume that for

that concentrated forces are more dangerous than divided ones.
Fifth, we assume that an unstable society always has an

chance

The idea is

that when expectations of the future are uncertain players have a choice between
experimenting with dierent actions - or with dierent institutions.

Under our

assumption that institutions can change on at most a single unit of land in a single
period, experimentation with institutions means that a single unit of land is lost.
Notice that the stability of opposing societies does not matter:

how disruptive

opponents are depends upon their strength and not upon whether or not they are
stable. Of course if they are not stable, the actions taken by that society are likely
to change in the future, and as a consequence their future ability to be disruptive
may be greater or less than their current ability.
Our nal and key assumption concerns the case of a stable society facing a single
opponent. That is except for a single

k 6= j

all the components of

Œì‚àíj

are zero. In

this case we assume that the conict resolution function has resistance dened by

r(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj ) = 0

in the example, allowing for an arbitrary function form, but keeping the threshold
between zero and positive resistance.
We have now dened a Markov process

places weight only on hegemonic classes that have maximal state power within the
class of hegemonic classes.

details can be found in Web Appendix 1.

and in the limit this ratio

goes to innity: most of the time there is a hegemonic class that maximizes state

Remark 1. (Relation to Literature on Group Evolution)
proach lies in our treatment of incentive compatibility.

The novelty of our ap-

Existing literature in the

area mainly focuses on the interplay between individual and group evolutionary selection: individual behavior which increases tness of a group, typically some form
of generosity, may be harmful for individual tness. This is the case both in the
Haystack Model as in Maynard Smith

[40] or Richerson and Boyd

[44] and in

Bowles' model of conict and evolution (Bowles [13]). The equilibrium dimension
in the group selection literature is generally missing.

One exception is Boyd and

Richerson [15] who consider a setting with multiple Evolutionary Stable Strategies
and show that group selection can be operative at the level of the equilibrium.
What does evolutionary theory enable us to conclude about state institutions?
How do the general results compare to that of the example?

First, the fact that

incentive constraints are not always satised makes little dierence.

By assump-

tion the learning dynamic is fast relative to the evolutionary dynamic. We think
empirically this is the correct assumption. In situations involving signicant social
disruption - for example in refugee camps - people quickly learn how to behave and
what to expect and social stability - and equilibrium - no matter how unpleasant
and institutionally ineectual - quickly reigns. Note however that during periods of

16

severe conict leading to the fall of institutions that have been long stable, the fact
that incentive constraints need not hold in the short run means that unstable and
incentive incompatible barbarian hordes will predominant for a brief period.
Returning to our simple example of institutional dierences indexed by the exclusivity parameter

œá

we see that the results of the simple two-society evolutionary

model are reinforced. Since we now allow for many potential societies, it now natural
to assume that both state power maximizing institutions

œáÃÇ are present.

œá‚àó and ecient institutions

Once again we conclude that absent signicant outside inuence there

will be a hegemony that will be inecient and excessively extractive, and indeed it
will be a hegemony of

œá‚àó .

Notice that we have assumed away technological dierences. Exogenous technological dierences can easily be introduced into the model - with the obvious
conclusion that given the same institutions and absent signicant outside inuence
we expect a hegemony of the superior technology. We do not think, however, that
exogenous technological dierences are that interesting:

more interesting are en-

dogenous technological dierences that arise from dierence in institutions. Unlike
the example, the general model of this section is broad enough to allow for models
in which dierent institutions lead to dierent levels of technology

16 . We do not

examine such models here, but it provides an interesting area for future research.

5. Conclusion

Readers of grand theories of history such as those of McNeil

[41], Cipolla [17],

Diamond [20] or Acemoglu and Robinson [3] will not nd surprising the idea that
ideas are spread by the conquest of the less advanced by the more advanced - indeed
it seems almost ubiquitous in their anecdotes and discussions. Missing from these
accounts, however, is a model of dynamic competition between conicting societies.
Here we introduce such a model and nd that there is a tendency towards hegemony

17 We also nd that

when outside forces are weak - but less so when they are strong.

these hegemonies tend to maximize state power and that this results in ineciently
high exclusiveness which in turn determines ineciently high extractiveness, that is
high taxes, high income for state ocials, low income for producers, and low welfare.

16

As the model does not allow for the possibility of continuing growth, it is not broad enough to

study technologies that lead to dierent long-run growth rates.

17

A recent empirical paper on the relation between warfare and institutions in the Italian Risorg-

imento is Dincecco, Federico and Vindigni [21].

17

An evolutionary model of the type introduced here has dynamics driven by
luck, and the intuition of the results follows from understanding this luck. To revolt successfully against a large powerful hegemonic society requires a considerable
amount of luck. The larger and more powerful the hegemonic society is, the more
luck is required, and so the more persistent it is likely to be. When there are strong
outside inuences to support the rebels less luck is required. There is an intuition
here as well for the short-lived empires of Alexander the Great, Ghengis Khan or
Tamurlane.

The best kind of luck to have in order to successfully overwhelm a

powerful neighbor is to have a great deal of military power: a strong military organization, good technology - and a charismatic and brilliant leader. Even better luck
is to have that leader convince his followers to set aside their incentive constraints.
Such luck will not last long - eventually warriors or their descendants will prefer to
follow their incentives and consume jewelry rather than swords - but the luck
can last long enough to conquer the relevant world. These are the barbarian hordes
in the proof of our main theorem.
The theory has many implications. In the introduction we gave a broad view of
hegemony and the connection to the strength of outside forces. Here we give some
more speculative thoughts about institutions and history seen through the lens of
hegemonic state power and outside inuence.

Hong Kong and Singapore.

We note that the libertarian success stories favored

by Milton Friedman in Singapore and Hong Kong were protected from outside inuence - in the case of Hong Kong by the British military, and in the case of Singapore
by a water barrier.

An aspect of the theory worthy of future exploration is that

because there is less scope for competition small geographically protected areas are
likely to have a broader range of social arrangements - both ecient and inecient

18

- than larger areas.

Democracy and military spending.

In the range between welfare maximization

and state power maximization the theory predicts a positive relationship between
exclusiveness and state power. If one takes military spending as a measure of state
power this suggests that more democratic societies would generally spend less on
the military than less democratic societies. This is a robust nding in the empirical
political science literature: see for example Dunne and Perlo-Freeman [22] or Dunne

18

The wide range of (admittedly very primitive) social arrangements in New Guinea may be a

case in point.

18

et al [23].

Decreasing exclusiveness.

Analyses such as those of Homan and Rosenthal

[33] argue that the transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy in Europe
was determined by the higher tax revenue to be employed for military purposes
which a parliament could generate.

This can occur in our model if technological

change increases the eciency of tax collection
optimal degree of exclusiveness.

œÑ

in which case it will reduce the

For example improved military technology - the

development of rearms, for example - can improve the eciency of tax collection
(raise

œÑ)

resulting in both state power maximizing and welfare maximizing levels of

exclusiveness declining.

Technology and state power.

We have modeled the eect of exclusiveness on

output as taking place through the tax system. There can also be a direct eect
of exclusiveness lowering productivity as suggested for example in Acemoglu and
Robinson [3].

19 As indicated above, it is possible to study models of endogenous

technology driven by institutional dierences in our general evolutionary model. We
do not expect that it will change the general nature of the conclusions from the simple example, but may have additional interesting implications.

In particular the

nature of technology may interact with institutions. For example, at the beginning
of the cold war, technology favored assembly line manufacturing which is relatively
amenable to central planning, and so the Soviet Union, a particularly exclusive and
extractive system accumulating military power, was able to compete successfully
with the United States. By contrast as technology changed to favor greater decentralization and inclusiveness, it is likely that the enormous growth of GDP in the
United States relative to the Soviet Union made it impossible for the Soviet Union
to continue to compete.

Nationalism.

We have characterized institutions by exclusiveness - the extent

to which state power is unchecked in collecting taxes. Another dimension in which
institutions may dier is in the extent to which tax revenue is checked in being
used as external state power. It is simple to modify the model to include another
multiplier which we might think of as nationalism which converts the portion of tax
revenue devoted to state power to actual (external) state power. At the extreme we

19

There can also be a direct benet to government ocials of state power, for example, they may

have a taste for warfare as in Homan

[32] - this would not change the qualitative nature of our

results.

19

can think of this as being zero in the case of Japan where the constitution prohibits

20

the use of military force externally.

Such a multiplier has no implication for

welfare, but obviously state power is maximized when the coecient of nationalism
is one. In other words: nationalism is a necessary characteristic of long-lived societies
- which may help to explain its prevalence.

21

An evolutionary model is a model of the very long-run and historically hegemonic
societies have lasted many centuries.

Moreover, the decline and fall of societies

according to the model is driven by infrequent bad luck.

Applying the model to

current aairs is particularly speculative, more so given that modern institutions

are quite recent with the oldest ones being those of the U.S.

with the theory the U.S. - which has a very high level of military expenditure - has
had an eective hegemony over the North American continent for 237 years.

We

notice also that despite modern technology the large oceans appear to still provide
a formidable military obstacle - it seems unlikely that either the United States or
China is likely to bypass these barriers to establish a world hegemony. With ve
major rivals in Eurasia - Europe, Russia, China, India and the Islamic block - we
may hope that the U.S. may play the role in the future of the Eurasian continent
that we believe England did in continental Europe - that of preventing hegemony

23

and preserving competition.

21

Notice that just as exclusiveness may have a direct eect on technology, so may nationalism:

for example, the same desire to protect against outsiders and to conquer them may also inhibit the
peaceful arrival of productive immigrants and so lower output. Never-the-less unless this force is
very strong, maximizing state power will involve a substantial amount of nationalism.

Additional information about the Parthian Empire from Wright

[48]. Note that the conven-

tional dates of the Parthian Empire conclude with the Sassanian Empire, but the hegemony of the
Parthian Empire appears to have ended following the war with Rome in 114 AD, so we take that
as the end date.

Additional history
We count the hegemony of Rome from Augustus in 27 BCE to the permanent
division into the Eastern and Western Empires in 395 CE, a period of 422 years.
The Western Empire did not maintain a hegemony for a signicant period after this.
We date the end of the hegemony of the Eastern Empire to the expansion of the
Caliphate in 814 CE. - 395 a period of 429 years.
In England we date the beginning of the hegemony from the Norman conquest
in 1066, a period of 947 years.
We date the hegemony of the Ottoman Empire from the conquest of Egypt in
1517 to the Greek revolution in 1821, a period of 304 years.

Demographic data taken from Maddison [39]
Ratio of population of Mongolia to China in 1820 CE (the earliest date for which
there is an estimate of the Mongolian population): .2%.
Ratio of population of Scandinavia to Western Europe excluding Greece and the
British Isles in 1000 CE 5%.
Ratio of population of United Kingdom to all of Western Europe: In 1000 CE
it is 8% and remains relatively stable until it rises in the early late 1800s, rising to
19% in 1820 CE and remaining relatively stable since then.
Estimate of ratio of population of Central Asia to India in 1820 CE. The ratio of
the population of Afghanistan to India in 1820 is 1.6%. Data for the rest of Central
Asia is not available until 1950 CE. We computed the ratio of the population of
the rest of Central Asia (the Soviet stans: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) to Afghanistan in 1950 CE when data is available
as being about double that of Afghanistan. Assuming that ratio is about the same
as in 1820 CE we estimate the overall ratio of the population of Central Asia to
India in 1820 CE as about 5%.

Web Appendix 1: Proof of the Main Theorem
Theorem. [Main Theorem from the text] For  > 0 there is a unique ¬µ() that
places positive weight on all states. As  ‚Üí 0 there is a unique limit ¬µ. There is a
critical value of A0 > 0. If A0 ‚â• A0 then ¬µ places positive weight on all states. If
A0 < A0 then ¬µ places weight only on hegemonic classes that have maximal state
power within the class of hegemonic classes.

Proof.

First, we examine hegemonic classes more closely and explain the role of

the maximal state power.

The resistance to disruption in a hegemonic class is

which is non-decreasing in

Œì(st ),

A0 + Œì(st )
A0



and is zero for

Œì(st ) ‚â§ A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1)
and strictly increasing for larger

Œì(st ).

Take

A0 = Œì‚àó /(œÜ ‚àí 1) > 0.

Then if

A0 ‚â• A0

the resistance of all hegemonic classes is zero.
If the resistance of all hegemonic classes is zero or if

 > 0

then all feasible

transitions have positive probability. This implies that there is a positive probability
of moving from any state to any other state. First destabilize all the stable societies
by having them lose all their land. Then have each remaining unstable society lose
land in such a way as to match the target land holding of the target institutions.
Then change the action proles for each society to match the target. Repeat this
once, and for every society that is supposed to be stable in the target, make it stable.

 > 0 the process M ()
¬µ() is unique and places positive weight on all
states. Next, observe that the stationary distributions are the solutions of ¬µ() =
M ()¬µ(). Under our assumptions in the limit as  ‚Üí 0 we have M () ‚Üí M (0) from
which it follows that if ¬µ is any limit point of ¬µ() then ¬µ is a stationary distribution
for M (0). When A0 > A0 then, as ¬µ(0) is unique it follows that ¬µ() ‚Üí ¬µ(0).
Now suppose A0 < A0 . A theorem of Young [49] shows that from the assumption
that M () is regular it is still the case that ¬µ() has a unique limit ¬µ. Now however
M (0) can have many stationary distributions, so the question is: which one is ¬µ?
Notice that any hegemonic class for which Œì(st ) > A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1) is absorbing in M (0)
since when  = 0 the probability of disruption is zero. On the other hand from any

However, a theorem of Ellison [24] shows that these classes have probability

¬µ

and the application of Ellison's method yields other useful information

about the dynamics.

H denote the set of hegemonic absorbing classes, that is, for which st ‚àà ht ‚àà
H Œì(st ) > A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1). In addition to writing st ‚àà H we write (j, aj ) ‚àà H when there
is a hegemonic state st at (j, aj ) in H .
To apply Ellison's method we must determine for each hÃÇt ‚àà H the basin consisting of states not in hÃÇt for which when  = 0 the probability of reaching st is one.
Suppose hÃÇt is hegemonic at sÃÇt and (j, aj ), and consider states st 6= sÃÇt in dierent
classes. If œÄ(1, Œìjt , Œì‚àíjt )[0] = 0, since we have assumed that united opponents are
stronger than divided ones and œÜ > 1 it must also be the case that for some k we
have œÄ(bk , Œìk , Œì‚àík )[0] > 0. Hence in this case there is no chance of j losing land,

loses land, since that will only increase the subsequent chance of losing

land, there is a positive probability it will lose all its land and become absorbed in
some dierent hegemonic state. Hence the basin are exactly those states for which

œÄ(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[0] = 0.
The radius is dened as the least resistance path starting at a state

sÃÇt ‚àà hÃÇt

out

of the basin. The initial resistance to losing a unit of land is


q

A0 + Œì(sÃÇt )
A0


.

Subsequently the greatest chance of losing another unit of land occurs when there is
a single opponent who has the highest possible state power. Consider then a society

k

and prole

ak

such that

Œ≥k (ak )

is maximal over all societies and proles. Such a

combination may not be an equilibrium so would be unstable, but we will assume
that even if it is an equilibrium it is unstable. Notice that this combination may
use the same institutions as

hÃÇt

but this is okay because we have assumed that there

are duplicate institutions. We refer to such a prole as a barbarian horde. When
the opponent is a barbarian horde the resistance to losing land is smallest until the
threshold

œÜ

is reached and resistance falls to zero.

Denote by

Rj (aj )

the sum of

resistances until the threshold is reached, and notice that it is strictly increasing in

Œ≥j .

Once the threshold is reached there is then a zero resistance path to every other

hegemonic absorbing state: the horde remains unstable and takes over all the land
with no resistance. Since it is unstable, it than can lose units of land without any
resistance, and there is a positive probability independent of



so that the land is

lost to the target hegemony.
We conclude that the radius of

Œ≥j .

st

is

Rj (aj )

and this is strictly increasing in

On the other hand, to compute the co-radius of we must nd the hegemonic

absorbing state from which it takes the longest to get back to

29

st .

So the co-radius

of

(j, aj )

is just

CR =

min
(k,ak )‚ààH\(j,aj )

Hence when

(j, aj )

attains

Œì‚àó

Rj (aj )

so that

Rk (ak ).

is maximal we have

R > CR.
