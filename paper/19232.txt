Friends or Family? Revisiting the Effects of High School Popularity on Adult Earnings
Jason Fletcher
NBER Working Paper No. 19232
July 2013
JEL No. J01,J1,J3
ABSTRACT
Recent evidence has suggested that popularity during high school is linked with wages during mid-life
using the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. The results were shown to be robust to a large set of individual-level
heterogeneity included completed schooling, cognitive ability, and personality measures. This paper
revisits this question by first replicating the results using an alternative dataset that is very similar
in structure. Like the previous results, the Add Health baseline effects suggest that an additional high
school friendship nomination is linked to a 2% increase in earnings around age 30. However, leveraging
the unique sibling structure of the Add Health shows that sibling comparisons eliminate any associations
between popularity and earnings. The findings suggest that families, rather than friends, may be the
cause of the association.

Introduction
In this paper, I re‐examine the evidence of the effects of popularity on labor market
returns. A new study by Conti et al. (2012, forthcoming) uses the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study
(WLS) to estimate both the predictors of high school friendship nominations as well as the labor
market returns to these nominations. The authors show a robust relationship across multiple
specifications, suggesting that having one additional high school nomination increases labor
market earnings by approximately 2% around age 35. This is the key result that I re‐examine.
Other aspects of the Conti et al. (henceforth CGMP) paper center on making a series of
statistical adjustments for several issues with the WLS data. While the WLS is a unique and
impressive dataset, it has several limitations related to linking high school nominations with
earnings. First, the WLS nominations measures are likely incomplete because each student was
limited to nominating three classmates as “friends”, so that 60% of the individuals in the data
have “no friends” who nominated them. Second, the data were collected from a single high
school graduating class (1957) from a single state (Wisconsin). This feature of the data poses
several issues with external validity. In addition to the state and cohort external validity issues,
the sampled individuals were all high school seniors, so the distribution of educational
attainments is left‐censored. However, even with these limitations, I am able to closely
replicate the main findings using an alternative dataset that has none of these limitations.
As CGMP argue, understanding key determinants of labor market earnings is an
increasingly important topic in economics. An important shift in the literature has been a focus
on “non‐cognitive,” or social, skills as key, and relatively unexamined, determinants of human
capital accumulation and labor market rewards (e.g. Heckman et al. 2006, Mihaly 2009,
Fletcher in press). However, the current evidence on many of these skills is underdeveloped.
Indeed, most papers are unable to leverage quasi‐random variation in the key factors of
interest (unlike the use of compulsory schooling laws (Angrist and Krueger 1991) or college
openings (Currie and Moretti 2003) in the larger and more mature labor returns literature). In
addition, the literature focusing on estimating the returns to social skills is nearly always unable
to account for family‐level heterogeneity. This may be important because of the likely partial
genetic transmission of personality and other noncognitive skills (e.g. Bouchard and Loehlin
2

2001) as well as the many examples in the economics literature where the use of sibling
comparisons has quantitatively or qualitatively changed the baseline findings. For example
Almond et al. (2003) show that estimates of the impacts of birth weight are 80% lower when
using sibling comparison2. Fletcher (in press) shows evidence that a common estimate of the
importance of the personality measure of contentiousness on earnings is reduced to zero when
sibling comparisons are used.
This paper asks whether the estimated effects of popularity on earnings reported by
CGMP are sensitive to controls for family level heterogeneity using a complementary dataset.
The baseline estimates are nearly identical across datasets, however, I find that sibling
comparisons suggest no detectable effects of high school popularity on adult earnings.

Data and Empirical Strategy
This paper uses the restricted version of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health). Add Health is a school‐based, longitudinal study of the health‐related
behaviors of adolescents and their outcomes in adulthood. Beginning with an in‐school
questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7
through 12 in 1994‐95, the study follows up with a series of in‐home interviews of students
approximately one year, six years, and 13 years later. Other sources of data include
questionnaires for parents, siblings, fellow students, and school administrators.
Of the 20,000 individuals surveyed in Wave 1, approximately 15,000 are also followed
through age 30 at Wave 4. In order to also link these individuals with their high school social
network measures, an additional 5,000 individuals are removed from the data due to missing
network data3. Thus, the baseline sample is approximately 10,000 individuals. The Wave 1
survey also included an over‐sampling of siblings who attended the same schools and were in
grades 7‐12 of approximately 5,000 respondents in the original 20,000 in‐home sample. I am

Similarly, Fletcher (2011) shows that the impacts of breastfeeding on later outcomes often disappear when
sibling comparisons are employed.
3
There are two linked data collection activities in Add Health. There was an original (“Wave 0”) in‐school survey of
90,000 children that ascertained friendship nominations and basic demographic information. Secondly, there are
the four longitudinal “in‐home” surveys that track 20,000 children. Approximately 75% of the 20,000 children in
the in‐home sample were also in the in‐school sample.

able to use approximately 2,500 siblings who are followed to Wave 4 and also where each co‐
sibling has information on their social networks during high school.
Earnings are collected in Wave 4 and come from the following question and are interval
coded4: “Now think about your personal earnings. How much income did you receive from
personal earnings before taxes—that is, wages.” Using this coding procedure, the average
earnings for this sample of adults (average age nearly 30) is over $37,000. As in standard social
science surveys, a host of sociodemographic data has also been collected, including age, race,
birth order, gender, and family background characteristics such as maternal education, rural
status, and parental marital status at Wave 1 are included. I follow CGMP and control for these
demographic characteristics as well as an indicator for whether the individual is an only child.
In some specifications, I also control for a measure of ability (the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test), grade point average at Wave 1, completed years of schooling at Wave 4, and the Big 5
personality measures at Wave 4—adding these controls follow the specifications in CGMP.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the full sample. Appendix Table 1A shows that there
are no important differences between the main sample and sibling sub‐sample.
Finally, like CGMP, I use as a measure of high school popularity the number of
nominations that each individual received from other high school classmates (“in‐degree”).
While the WLS had a maximum allowable number of nominations of three individuals attending
the same school, Add Health’s maximum number is ten (and fewer than 1% of students make
10 nominations). Also, WLS is only able to link incoming nominations for individuals where
both students were followed (WLS sampled 1/3 of each graduating class), while Add Health has
the full set of nominations for all individuals in school on the day of the survey. This limitation
with WLS has the implication that 60% of the sample has no nominations received. Table 2
shows that in Add Health, this figure is <10%.
A final difference between this examination and the CGMP paper is that I use both
women and men in the analysis and show in an appendix table (Table 3A) that adding an
interaction between in‐degree and gender shows no statistically or economically significant
4

The midpoint of each interval is used in the analysis. The intervals include: $0, <$5,000, $5,000‐9,999, 10,000‐
14,999, 15,000‐19,999, 20,000‐24,999, 25,000‐29,999, 30,000‐39,999, 40,000‐49,999, 50,000‐74,999, 75,000‐

male and female respondents.

Results
This paper examines the associations between high school popularity and adult
earnings. Table 3 reports results replicating CGMP. Column 1 estimates a baseline regression
and finds a 2% earnings increase for each additional same‐sex friendship nomination; like
CGMP there is no effect for the number of nominations sent (out degree). CGMP controls for a
number of school characteristic not available in the Add Health. To follow their specification, I
control for school level fixed effects beginning in Column 2, though this results in little change
in the estimates. CGMP then control for ability and education (my Column 3) and personality
(my Column 4), showing that the results are not very sensitive to these controls. Thus, even
with samples from different eras (1950s vs. 1990s), different geographical areas (Wisconsin vs.
National samples), and different sample strategies (high school seniors vs 7‐12th graders), the
results are remarkably similar in the replication attempt. Finally, in order to examine whether
moving from the full to sibling sample may change the results (even without controlling for
sibling fixed effects), Column 5‐7 repeat Column 2‐4 with the sibling sample and show very
similar results. A potential issue with using sibling fixed effects is lack of variation in the
outcome and/or the popularity measure. However, in this sample, only 13% of siblings have
the same value of in‐degree (average difference between siblings is 2.64, with a 2.88 standard
deviation); only 3% of the sample of siblings have the same wage (average difference is
$23,000, with a standard deviation of $39200).
The main findings of the paper are presenting in Table 4. Here I repeat earlier estimates
in Column 1‐3 with no sibling fixed effects and then proceed to add sibling fixed effects in
Column 4‐6. What is clear from the results is that the effects of popularity on earnings are
quite sensitive to controls for family‐level heterogeneity. Indeed, the baseline sibling fixed
effects estimate is zero. While the standard errors in the sibling models are too large to rule
out the baseline results, they do suggest the fragility of the point estimates to family controls.

5

In contrast, the associations between completed schooling and wages are quite similar with the
baseline and sibling fixed effects results.
Conclusion
Understanding the key factors related to human capital accumulation and wage
determination is a central question in labor economics. During the past decade there has been
a shift of attention from traditional measures of cognitive ability and education to less
examined measures of “non‐cognitive skills” such as personality, self control, leadership, and
popularity. While the evidence linking cognitive ability to wages is strong and the literature is
mature, much less is conclusive in the newer literature on non‐cognitive skills. In part, this is
because many research designs used to estimate the returns to education and cognitive skills
have yet to be used to examine non‐cognitive skills. This paper begins to fill this void by
comparing siblings’ popularity in high school with their earnings around age 30. I replicate new
results in the literature using a different dataset and show that the results are sensitive to
controls for family‐level heterogeneity and suggest no return to popularity in earnings for this
new cohort of workers.
