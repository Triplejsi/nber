Competition in the Audit Market: Policy Implications

ABSTRACT
The audit market's unique combination of features–its role in capital market transparency, mandated
demand, and concentrated supply–means it receives considerable attention from policymakers. We
explore the effects of two market scenarios that have been the focus of policy discussions: a) further
supply concentration due to one of the "Big 4" auditors exiting and b) mandatory audit firm rotation.
To do so, we first estimate publicly traded firms' demand for auditing services, treating services provided
by each of the Big 4 as differentiated products. We then use those estimates to calculate how each
scenario would affect client firms' consumer surplus. We estimate that, conservatively, exit by one
of the Big 4 would reduce client firms' surplus by $1.2-1.8 billion per year. These estimates reflect
only firms' lost options to hire the exiting auditor; they do not include the likely fee increases resulting
from less competition among auditors. We calculate that the latter could result in audit fee increases
between $0.3-0.5 billion per year. Such losses are substantial; by comparison, total audit fees for public
firms were $11 billion in 2010. We find similarly large impacts from mandatory audit firm rotation,
estimating consumer surplus losses at approximately $2.4-3.6 billion if rotation were required after
ten years and $4.3-5.5 billion if rotation were mandatory after only four years.

Introduction

The market for financial audits exhibits a set of features that distinguish it from other markets for
business services (and for that matter, many other goods more broadly). First, it is seen by many
to play an important and in some ways unique role in preserving transparency and improving the
functioning of capital markets (e.g., Watts and Zimmerman (1983), Black (2001), and Ball (2001)).
Relatedly, failures of auditors to catch and report improprieties are often highly—and occasionally
spectacularly—visible.
Second, a substantial portion of demand in the market is mandated. Publicly traded firms are
compelled to purchase audit services, and there are no services from outside the industry that can
legally serve as substitutes.
Third, the market’s supply side is highly concentrated. Among publicly traded companies in
the U.S., for example, the majority of audit engagements and almost all audit fees involve just four
audit firms (the “Big 4”: Ernst & Young, Deloitte Touche, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers).
In 2010 the Big 4 handled 67% of audit engagements and collected over 94% of audit fees. (For
a breakdown of market shares over the recent decade, see Table 1.) As discussed by Velte and
Stiglbauer (2012), similar concentration is observed in the audit markets of many other developed
economies.
The combination of these features has resulted in the audit industry being subject to frequent
policy debates. In this paper, we explore two oft-recurring discussions in this vein. The first regards
the effects of further concentration in supply due to one of the Big 4 audit firms exiting the market.
The second involves the consequences of imposing a mandatory audit firm rotation policy.
Both of these scenarios have already colored policy toward the industry. There have been

1

several recent cases in which a Big 4 audit firm could arguably have been criminally indicted but
the Department of Justice decided to not file charges, probably because of concerns about further
increasing concentration.1 For example, in 2005 KPMG admitted criminal wrongdoing by creating
tax shelters that helped clients evade $2.5 billion in taxes. Nevertheless, the Department of Justice
did not indict KPMG and instead entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (Johnson (2010)).
Moreover, according to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy examiner’s report (Valukas (2010)), Ernst
& Young assisted Lehman Brothers in implementing its Repo 105 transactions, which allowed
Lehman to temporarily reduce its leverage when preparing its financial statements. Nonetheless,
the Department of Justice did not pursue criminal charges against Ernst & Young.2
With regard to mandatory auditor rotation, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(the “PCAOB”) is in active discussions about implementing such a policy for SEC registrants.
During the PCAOB’s hearings in March 2012 on mandatory audit firm rotation, panelists voiced
opposing views about the costs and benefits of mandatory audit firm rotation. For example, the
executive director of the AICPA’s Center for Audit Quality stated that mandatory audit firm rotation would hinder audit committees in their oversight of external auditors, while former SEC
chairman Arthur Levitt supported mandatory rotation because “investors deserve the perspectives
of different professionals every so often, particularly when an auditor’s independence can be reasonably called into question” (Tysiac (2012)). Moreover, in June 2013 the House Financial Services
Committee unanimously passed a bill to prohibit the PCAOB from mandating audit firm rotation
(Cohn (2013)).
We seek to explore how the fruition of these two scenarios—the disappearance of one of the
Big 4 and the imposition of mandatory auditor rotation—would affect the audit market, and in

In contrast, the New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo sued Ernst & Young claiming that the audit firm
helped Lehman “engage in a massive accounting fraud” (Public Accounting Report (2011)).

particular the consequences for publicly traded firms, its primary customers. Addressing these
questions satisfactorily requires, at the very least, measurements of the willingness of firms to
substitute among individual auditors and the value firms place (if any) on extended relationships
with auditors. However, prior research on the structure of the audit market has focused primarily
on either correlations between audit fees and firm characteristics or substitutability between the
Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditor groups.3 While this work has offered insights to several questions, its
focus has left a gap that we seek to begin to fill with this study.
Our empirical approach treats the audit market much like any other differentiated product
market (even the mandatory nature of demand can easily be handled within our framework).4 We
model firms seeking audit services as choosing from among several producers of those services (i.e.,
the audit firms), with each potential auditor offering varying aspects of service that are potentially
valued differentially by each client firm.5 Each publicly listed firm considers how well the attributes
of each auditor’s product match its needs (these attributes include price—the audit fees) and hires
the auditor offering the best net value.
With this factor demand framework, we can use data on publicly listed firms’ choices of auditors
to measure via revealed preference how firms view the audit services provided by each of the
Big 4 auditors as well as by smaller audit service providers. Importantly, we can quantify a firm’s
willingness to substitute among auditors. That is, we can compute the dollar transfer that would
be necessary to make a client switch to a different auditor. In particular, we are able to calculate
the transfer necessary to compensate client firms who lose a potential auditor choice due to exit
3
For examples of studies that examine substitutability between the Big 4 and non-Big 4 groups, see Willenborg
(1999), Ettredge, Kwon, and Lim (2009), and Lennox, Francis, and Wang (2012)
4
Our empirical approach neither assumes nor imposes differentiation. It instead allows for differentiation among
the Big 4 audit firms and lets the data speak as to its existence. In this way, it contrasts with prior research that
assumes no differentiation among the Big 4 (e.g., Doogar and Easley (1998) and Sirois and Simunic (2013)).

Because audits are inputs into firms’ production activities, these are differentiated factor markets, but the economics are essentially the same as in markets for differentiated outputs.

of a Big 4 auditor, as well as to quantify clients’ willingness to pay for longer-term relationships
with a particular auditor, and hence what value the client firms would lose if forced to break such
relationships because of mandatory auditor rotation. Thus we can address quantitatively some of
the key policy questions surrounding the issues of further auditor concentration and mandatory
auditor rotation.
Our analyses indicate that the exit of any of the Big 4 auditors would result in substantial losses
in client firms’ expected consumer surplus (that is, the firms’ value of their purchased audit services
in excess of the fees they pay for them; the net benefit they derive from the audit services). We
estimate that, conservatively, client firms’ consumer surplus will fall by between $1.2–1.8 billion
per year. This loss in surplus can be interpreted as the total amount of cash transfers client firms
would require to compensate them for losing the ability to hire the exiting auditor. These figures
reflect only the direct effect of the loss of auditor choice; they do not account for the likely increases
in audit fees that would occur due to less competition among the remaining auditors. Using our
data to estimate the latter effect, we calculate moving from the Big 4 to the Big 3 could result in
audit fee increases between $0.3–0.5 billion per year. These higher fees correspond dollar-for-dollar
with lost consumer surplus among client firms, so this supply response effect exacerbates the pure
choice effect. Both of these losses are substantial; by comparison, total audit fees for public firms
were $11 billion in 2010.
We find similarly large impacts from mandatory audit firm rotation, estimating consumer surplus losses at approximately $2.4–3.6 billion if rotation were required after ten years (with the higher
estimated losses reflecting the anticipated fee setting responses of auditors to the new market rules)
and $4.3–5.5 billion if rotation were mandatory after only four years.
These estimates carry several caveats. First, the Big 4 audit firms operate worldwide, while

4

our estimates are based only upon their U.S. public clients. Second, due to a lack of data we are
also unable to include in our analysis private firms, though they would also suffer losses in surplus.
Finally, our estimates are limited to audit fees and services and do not take into account non-audit
and audit-related fees and services. Nevertheless, these estimates are informative about the costs
that could arise from changes in the audit industry’s market structure and from the implementation
of mandatory rotation.6 In addition, they provide some of the first estimates of the value of audit
firm-client matches.
The analyses in this paper are obviously relevant to those directly interested in the specific
policy-relevant counterfactuals in the audit industry that we examine in this paper. However, we
believe more general lessons can also be drawn from the analyses. They offer a framework for
investigating sets of demand, supply, and competitive issues in the audit market that extend well
beyond the two we investigate here. Indeed, there are entire literatures dedicated to examining
these issues, an attention reflecting in part the audit market’s special role in helping capital markets
function. Our framework, which has been applied in similar forms in other market settings but
(to our knowledge) is novel to research on the audit market, lets researchers quantify and isolate
demand- and supply-side fundamentals that allow fuller answers to questions about the nature and
effects of the market than the previous literature has been able to deliver. Further, the approach
here can be applied to address research questions about the markets for business services more
broadly, which are extensive in size and scope.
Our analysis is structured as follows. We first discuss how we model client firms’ choices
of auditor. We then describe the estimation of our demand model, including our approaches for
dealing with price endogeneity. We also explain how we handle a more atypical situation in demand
6

There may be benefits from mandatory auditor rotation as well. Quantifying those benefits requires an analytical
approach that is beyond the scope of this paper, however. Our estimates here offer a measurement of the costs of
rotation that an optimal policy would balance any benefits against.

estimation, the fact that we do not observe prices (fees) for producers (auditors) that a firm does
not hire. Then, after reporting and discussing our demand estimates, we use these estimates to
calculate the expected effects of the two counterfactual scenarios described above: greater audit
industry concentration and mandated auditor rotation.

2

Demand Model

We model publicly listed firms’ demand for audit services as reflecting a choice among several
potential auditors: each of the Big 4 and an amalgam outside good that includes all other audit
firms. Every client firm makes its choice based on the expected benefit it would obtain from hiring
each of the auditors. This benefit includes the effects of both firm-, auditor-, and match-specific
attributes and is net of the fees the auditor charges the client firm for its service.
While the discrete choice demand model we lay out below is in many ways standard in the
industrial organization literature, our approach differs from the substantial prior literature on
auditor choice in that this work has typically examined the determinants of the simple dichotomous
choice between using a Big 4 versus a non-Big 4 auditor. Our analytical structure allows us to
characterize much more fully the patterns of substitution among the individual auditors, and just
as importantly lets us tie client firms’ choices directly to parameters of their factor demands, which
is key to quantifying preferences in terms of dollar values.

2.1

Utility Specification

For firms’ choice of auditor, we specify the “inside” goods as the Big 4 auditors (Ernst & Young,
Deloitte Touche, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers) and the “outside” good as the aggregation

6

of all other auditors who provide audits to public firms (BDO Seidman, Grant Thornton, etc.).
Because we are identifying the preference parameters of publicly listed firms whose demand for
audit services is mandated, there is no true outside good in this setting. Thus we can simply
define the outside good as any auditor choice not in the Big 4. Mandated demand makes our task
easier, as we do not need to be concerned with defining the full breadth of potential demand for
the market, a necessary assumption in discrete choice settings where buyers might not purchase
any product in the market.
We model each client firm i’s utility from choosing auditor j as

Uij = δj − α ln(pij ) + βij xij + ij

(1)

in which δj is an auditor fixed effect that represents the mean utility that all potential clients obtain
from choosing auditor j (this variable subsumes brand effects and any other attributes of j’s services
that all potential clients value equally); pij is auditor j’s price for an audit of firm i (i.e., its audit
fees); α parameterizes the marginal willingness to pay for a log-dollar of audit fees; xij is a vector
of observable non-price characteristics of the client-auditor pair; βij are the utility loadings on
these characteristics, and ij represents an unobserved client-auditor specific component of utility
assumed to be independently and identically distributed.7 In our specification, audit fees enter
in logarithmic form. This implies that an additional dollar of audit fees matters less to a large
client than a small client. This specification is consistent with clients negotiating with auditors
over percentage changes in audit fees rather than absolute dollar changes.
To model the interactions between non-price characteristics of the client firm and the auditor, we
expand βij xij as follows. First, we interact the auditor fixed effect, δj , with the natural logarithm of
7
While we have labeled equation (1) as describing a client firm’s utility, it can be interpreted more broadly as any
objective function of the client with respect to its audit firm choice.

7

the client’s size, ln(T otalAssetsi ). This interaction allows us to capture audit firm preferences that
vary with client firm scale. For example, smaller firms may prefer non-Big 4 auditors, and there
could be heterogeneous size-based preferences across each of the Big 4 auditors. Second, we interact
the auditor fixed effects with an additional set of client characteristics commonly used in the audit
literature: ln(Segmentsi ) is the natural logarithm of the number of industrial segments in which
the client operators; F oreign Salesi is the ratio of foreign to total sales; Debti is the ratio of short
plus long-term debt to total assets; ROAi is the client’s return on assets; Inventory + Receivablesi
is the ratio of inventory plus accounts receivables to total assets; P ayablesi is the ratio of accounts
payable to total assets. These interactions allow rich variation in preferences for auditors across
client firms with different operating and financial characteristics. Fourth, we further interact δj
with industry indicators (using the Fama-French ten-industry classification system) to control for
any systematic preference differences across clients’ industries.
While firms in principle choose their auditor every year, the data reveal a strong tendency
to rehire the previous year’s auditor. This persistence can be seen in Table 2, which shows the
transition matrix for client firms’ auditor choices in consecutive years over the period 2008–2010.
The largest elements in the matrix by some distance are its diagonals; the probability of renewing an
existing auditor relationship is in the neighborhood of 95%. This persistence could reflect the effect
of match-specific capital formed during the course of an auditing relationship or reveal the strength
of some other match-specific unobservable utility component that makes retention more likely. To
parsimoniously incorporate any such effects, we add elements to equation (1) that allow for the
possibility that re-choosing the prior year’s auditor will deliver additional utility. Specifically, we
interact the auditor fixed effects with two additional variables: an indicator that equals one if the
client firm did not use the respective auditor in the prior year, 1(N ot clientij ), and the natural
logarithm of the number of consecutive years that the client firm has hired to its current auditor,
8

ln(Y earsClientij ).8
Given this utility function, a client firm’s choice decision is straightforward. Client i calculates
Uij for each of its five options (the Big 4 firms and the outside good) and then chooses the audit
firm j that provides the maximum Uij .

2.2

Estimation

Equation (1) can be written as Uij = Vij + ij , in which Vij ≡ βij xij − α ln(pij ) + δj is the observable
portion of utility, and ij is the unobserved portion of utility. If we assume that ij is distributed
type 1 extreme value, the predicted probability that client i chooses audit firm j is

Pij =

eVij
.
Σj eVij

(2)

This specification is the standard conditional logit commonly used in the industrial organization
and marketing literatures to estimate demand for discrete differentiated products.9 The conditional
logit is similar to a fixed effect regression in that any characteristic of client i that does not vary
across choices (here, auditors) drops out of equation (2). For example, firm size itself drops out of
equation (2); only interactions between firm size and the auditor fixed effects remain to influence
choice probabilities.
If yij = 1 represents that client i chooses auditor j and zero otherwise, then the log likelihood
8
We define this latter variable as zero for Big 4 firms that are not the client firm’s current auditor; thus the “not
current auditor” indicator coefficient reflects the difference in demand between an auditor with which the client firm
does not have a current relationship and an auditor with which the client has been matched for one year.

We maximize this log likelihood to obtain estimates of the utility/preference parameters α, β, and

2.3

Prices

The price/fee term of equation (1) raises a few estimation issues.

2.3.1

Missing Fees

One issue with equation (1) is that we only observe prices (audit fees) for actual matches between
clients and auditors. This is an unusual situation in demand estimation settings; the researcher
typically observes the prices of each item of the available choice set. We must therefore estimate
what fees a client would have expected to pay had it hired an audit firm other than the one it
ended up choosing.
We implement these “what if” prices using a predictive model estimated from the relationships between the fees in observed client-auditor matches and client-, auditor-, and match-specific
characteristics. We considered several prediction methods including ordinary least squares, lasso
regression, ridge regression, partial least squares, and two regression tree approaches (random partitioning and random forest).10 Based on root mean squared error derived from cross-fold validation,
we found that regression trees (specifically, random forest) best predict dollar audit fees using the
10

For a discussion of these methods, see Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009).

10

following set of predictor variables: total assets, the number of industrial segments the firm operates in, foreign sales, debt, return on assets, inventory & receivables, indicators to capture whether
and for how long the firm was a client of the auditor (all of the preceding are characteristics of the
client firm), and indicators for the Fama-French nine-industry classification. These are the same
variables included in our demand estimation and are commonly used in reduced form regressions
of audit fees (Hay, Knechel, and Wong (2006)).
In our demand estimations, we use predicted fees in equation (1) for all auditors, including the
actual audit firm chosen by the client. We do so because it is likely that the prices associated
with actual choices include a negative price shock that would otherwise bias our estimated price
coefficients toward zero. For a discussion of this issue, see Erdem, Keane, and Sun (1999).

2.3.2

Price Endogeneity

A major concern in most demand estimation settings is the possibility of price endogeneity (i.e.,
cov(pij , ij ) 6= 0). For example, if price is positively correlated with unobserved audit quality—say
because client firms have a greater willingness to pay for higher quality audits and/or auditors have
higher costs of delivering them—then the coefficient on price will be positively biased (toward zero,
given that theory predicts the coefficient should be negative). The resulting demand estimates
would make it appear that firms are less sensitive to audit fees than they really are. A way to avoid
this bias is to identify firms’ price sensitivity using fee variation that is driven by supply-side factors
that are uncorrelated with demand shifts (ij ). We are fortunate to have in our market setting and
data two sets of supply shifters that we can use in our audit fee prediction regressions to aid in this
identification. One uses the change in supply structure induced by the sudden and unexpected exit
of Arthur Andersen from the market, and the second uses exogenous increases in auditor supply

11

created by client mergers and acquisitions. We describe each in further detail below.

Disappearance of Arthur Andersen

We use the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002 due

to its post-Enron conviction (later overturned, though too late to revive Arthur Andersen as an
auditing firm) as an exogenous shock to supply in the audit market. The collapse of Arthur
Andersen reduced competition among auditors, creating an opportunity for the remaining suppliers
to increase their audit fees. Prior research on auditor specialization (e.g., Craswell, Francis, and
Taylor (1995), Hogan and Jeter (1999), and Casterella, Francis, Lewis, and Walker (2004)) implies
this supply shock was industry specific: the supply shift was larger in industries where Andersen
had a greater share of the audit market before its collapse (in terms of Andersen’s client firms’ share
of industry assets). This across-industry variation is useful because while one might be concerned
that Andersen’s collapse might be intertemporally linked with changes in the demand for auditing
services (due to the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley, for example), it is unlikely that these demand shifts
would be systematically related to Andersen’s prior share of the industry market. Thus the crossindustry variation in Andersen’s pre-collapse share offers a source of supply-driven price variation
that is likely orthogonal to shifts in the demand for auditing services.
To empirically validate the disappearance of Arthur Andersen as relevant to observed changes
in audit fees, Table 3 shows the results of regressing the log difference in client firms’ audit fees on
Andersen’s 2001 market share in the firms’ respective three-digit SIC industries, Andersen0 sShare.
If our argument that Andersen’s collapse is an inward shift in audit supply is correct, the coefficient
on Andersen0 s Share will be positive. That is, publicly traded firms in industries where Andersen
was more dominant before its collapse will see a greater increase in fees afterwards, regardless of
whether they were Andersen clients themselves.

12

We estimate these regressions separately for 2008, 2009, and 2010. We include as additional
controls indicator variables for the firm’s auditor in 2001 to account for any systematic differences
in fee growth tied to the client’s auditor. (For example, the fee growth for Andersen clients may
differ from the fee growth for firms that were Ernst & Young clients in 2001.) We also include
the change in the client’s logged total assets over each period, as the prior literature has found
that total assets are the most important predictor of audit fees. We cluster the standard errors
by three-digit SIC. Because we require that the data be available over each change interval, the
sample size drops monotonically from 2,806 clients for 2001–2008 to 2,399 clients for 2001–2010.
The results, presented in Panel A of Table 3, indicate that the coefficient on the supply shifter
Andersen0 sShare is indeed positive at every horizon and statistically significant for all horizons. In
other words, industries in which Andersen had a larger market share before its collapse experienced
greater growth in audit fees afterwards, and this effect persisted at least through 2010.11
An alternative explanation for these results is that Arthur Andersen charged lower prices and
provided lower quality audits, thereby leading to greater increases in audit fees for Andersen clients.
However, we do not believe that such an effect drives the results presented in Table 3 for two reasons.
First, Cahan, Zhang, and Veenman (2011) find that prior to the Enron scandal, Arthur Andersen
provided audits of similar quality to the audits provided by the other major audit firms. Second,
as seen in Panel B, we find similar effects if we limit the sample to firms that were not Andersen
clients.
Given the results in Table 3, we include Andersen0 s Share in the annual audit fee prediction
regressions. This variable offers variation in audit fees due to supply shocks that should be uncorrelated with clients’ relative demand for surviving auditors, allowing us to obtain unbiased estimates
11

We find similar results for the years 2002 through 2007.

13

of the sensitivity to fee changes of client firms’ auditor choices.

Client Mergers and Acquisitions

Our second source of supply-driven audit fee variation ex-

ploits mergers and acquisitions among client firms. Because each firm only needs a single auditor,
a merger or acquisition involving firms with different auditors will result in one auditor being
dropped. The audit firm that loses a client will find itself with excess capacity that should put
downward pressure on audit fees. Supply can also shift even if both pre-merger client firms have
the same auditor, because even though the merged firm requires greater auditing, the elasticity of
audit fees to total assets is approximately 0.3–0.4; some of the auditor’s overhead is duplicative
and can be freed for other uses. This creates excess audit capacity for the merged firm’s auditor
and the resulting price effects. These supply shifts will be orthogonal to audit demand shocks
as long as client-level mergers and acquisitions are driven by neither auditor choice nor audit fee
considerations, which strike us as quite likely.
To test whether mergers and acquisitions have the expected effects on audit fees, we regress
client firms’ logged fees on the prior year’s ratio of merged to total assets the firms’ respective
three-digit SIC industries, M erged Assets. We also control for the ratio of receivables to assets,
the ratio of inventories to assets, the return on assets, an indicator variable for whether the client
experienced a loss, the percent of foreign sales, the natural logarithm of the number of industrial
segments, an indicator for whether the firm is an accelerated filer,12 and firm, industry, and year
fixed effects. We cluster standard errors at the client level and estimate the regressions over the
sample period 2002–2011.
Columns (1) and (2) of Table 4 present the main results. Consistent with the logic outlined
12
The Securities and Exchange Commission requires registrants with an aggregate worldwide market value of equity
greater than $75 million to file their financial statements earlier than smaller registrants.

14

above, the coefficient on M erged Assets is negative and statistically significant in both column (1),
which includes auditor fixed effects, and in column (2), which does not. Firms in industries that
saw more action in mergers and acquisitions paid lower audit fees, all else equal.
As a further check on the validity of the merger measure as a supply shifter, we estimate
a specification that, rather than including M erged Assets computed for the prior year, instead
includes the ex post ratio of merged to total assets observed three years in the future. For these
tests, the coefficients on M erged Assets in columns (3) and (4) are positive and insignificant. Thus
merger activity leads price changes and not the reverse, increasing the likelihood that the results
reflect the supply-shift story outlined above rather than a spurious connection between fees and
merger activity due to other forces.

2.3.3

Fit of Predicted Audit Fees

Our random forest prediction specification yields fitted values that are highly correlated with actual audit fees within the sample. The Pearson product moment correlations between actual and
predicted fees are as follows: Ernst & Young, 0.977; Deloitte Touche, 0.959; KPMG, 0.971; PricewaterhouseCoopers, 0.970; all other auditors, 0.961. Figure A.1 in the Appendix presents plots of
actual versus predicted log audit fees for our sample.

3.1

Demand Estimation

Sample

Our sample consists of SEC registrants with available data. We pull audit fee data from Audit
Analytics, which provides fee data starting with the mandatory disclosure of audit fees in 2000. We
15

use Compustat to obtain accounting-based financials and the histories of auditor-client matches
prior to 2000 (we need this earlier match information to construct our measure of the extent of an
existing auditor-client relationship). Finally, we identify client-level mergers and acquisitions using
SDC Thomson data.

3.2

Client Firms’ Preferences over Auditors

Panel A of Table 5 presents the results from estimating our benchmark demand model. These
preference parameters form the basis for our estimates of clients’ willingness to pay for audit services
and willingness to substitute among audit firms. We estimate the preference functions separately
by year over 2008–2010. To capture restrictions in the client’s choice set, we remove audit firms
that resigned from auditing the client in the prior three years. We identify such resignations from
the Audit Analytics database. Such resignations arise from disagreements over fees, accounting
practices, or issuances of going concern opinions.13
Several patterns emerge across the annual estimates. First, client firms’ auditor choices are
sensitive to audit fees. The coefficient on ln(Audit f eesij ) is negative and significant for each year
in the sample. We calculate and discuss the elasticities implied by these estimates below.14
Second, for each of the Big 4 audit firms, the interactions between the auditor fixed effects
and client size are positive and significant each year, implying that larger clients have a stronger
13
In addition, we estimated a separate set of demand parameters using firms in the top half of the distribution of
size to address the possibility that the Big 4 audit firms selectively choose small clients because of litigation risk. Our
demand estimates for this restricted sample are similar to those presented in Table 5. Moreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act prohibits audit firms from providing certain consulting services to their clients. Unfortunately, we are unable to
observe restrictions on clients’ choice sets due to such consulting relations with audit firms.
14
While as noted we focus on the post-2001 period in order to exploit exogenous variation created by the implosion
of Arthur Andersen, we found negative and significant coefficients on ln(Audit f eesij ) in untabulated tests for 2000
and 2001. We also estimated the model using fees predicted without including the Andersen implosion and merger
supply-shifters. As theory predicts, the point estimates on predicted fees were on average more positive (that is,
smaller in magnitude) than those in Table 5. The size of the differences were modest, however: the 2008 coefficient
was essentially unchanged, while the 2009 and 2010 coefficients were -1.75 and -1.78, respectively. Thus any price
endogeneity due to unobservable demand shifts that existed in the market was relatively minor.

preference for the Big 4. Similarly, client firms having a larger share of sales in foreign markets also
have a preference for using a Big 4 auditor.
Third, having hired an auditor the previous year greatly affects the probability that a client
firm hires them again, even after controlling for match-specific observables. The coefficients on the
interactions of Big 4 dummies with 1(N ot clientij ) are negative and significant in every case. Thus
the persistence in auditor choice discussed above reflects an unobserved match-specific attribute.
On the other hand, the interactions with ln(Y ears clientij ) are generally positive but not often
significant, implying that while having a current relationship is an important determinant of auditor
choice, the duration of the history of this relationship is less important.
Panels B and C of Table 5 present annual mean estimates of client firms’ own-price elasticities—
the percentage change in the probability of choosing the auditor resulting from a one percent
increase in audit fees. In general, as reflected in Panel B, the average estimated elasticities are in
the neighborhood of −1.5 to −1.7. An interesting contrast is observed, however, when we look at
client firms’ elasticities for their auditor in the prior year, as shown in Panel C. These estimates,
which incorporate the effect on elasticities of our current-match variables (i.e., the interactions of
auditor fixed effects with an indicator for the firm not being a client of the auditor and the number
of years that the client firm has been working with its current auditor), reveal that client firms’
choices are much less sensitive to changes in the fees of their current auditors. Elasticity estimates
for the Big 4 are around −0.05 to −0.1, an order of magnitude smaller than the average elasticities in
Panel B. These differences reflect the powerful effect on choices of match-specific utility components
within existing client-auditor pairs. As we will see below, the forced destruction of those matches,
whether due to the exit of one of the Big 4 auditors or the imposition of mandatory auditor rotation,
can destroy a considerable amount of client firms’ consumer surplus.

17

3.3

Fit of the Model

Our demand model fits the data quite well. Table 6 shows the correspondence between the client
firms’ predicted auditor choices (i.e., the auditor with the largest estimated mean utility for the
client, Vij ) and their actual choices. Across each of the Big 4 audit firms, the model correctly
predicts auditor choice for at least 91% of the clients. Moreover, for clients that chose a non-Big 4
audit firm the model based predictions are correct for over 96% of the clients.
We also have an interesting opportunity to test the model’s predictive abilities by seeing how well
it did in predicting which auditor former Andersen clients would choose in 2002, after Andersen’s
collapse forced them to choose a new auditor. Table 7 lays out the results. Panel A presents three
sets of demand estimates for 2002: the first column shows estimates obtained using only clients of
Arthur Andersen in 2001; the second column uses all client firms in 2002; the third column uses
a sample of all client firms that were not Andersen clients in 2001. We use these parameters to
generate predicted probabilities of auditor choice for Andersen clients in 2002. In general, these
demand parameters are similar to those presented in Table 5. Importantly, the price coefficient is
similar both in sign and magnitude to the baseline estimates. Panel B presents elasticity estimates
for Andersen clients based on parameter estimates from the three models. As can be seen, these
are similar to those presented in Panel B of Table 7.
In Panels A, B, and C of Table 8 we compare the actual auditor choices of Andersen clients in
2002 to the auditor with the highest predicted choice probability according to the demand estimates
in Panel A of Table 7. In general, all three models provide better predictions than just chance.
With one exception (Arthur Andersen clients in 2001 who hired PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2002,
with estimates obtained using only the Andersen clients sample—i.e., the fourth row of Panel A),
the auditor that the model predicts as most likely to be hired was in fact the auditor that the client
18

firm actually hired. Importantly, even parameters estimated using only non-Andersen clients had
predictive abilities for former Andersen client firms’ choices.

3.4

3.4.1

Alternative Specifications

Nested Logit

An alternative model of audit firm choice is that clients first choose whether to use a non-Big 4 or
Big 4 auditor and then, conditional on choosing a Big 4 auditor, choose which of the Big 4 to engage.
To explore this possibility, we re-estimated our demand system using a nested logit specification,
which incorporates this sequential choice structure explicitly. For these estimates, the substitution
parameter between Big 4 and non-Big 4 is approximately 0.85–0.88 and significantly different than
the parameters that arise under the conditional logit model.15 However, the estimated marginal
willingness to pay, α, is similar to the baseline estimates presented in Panel A of Table 5. Further,
there is no generally accepted method for generating error terms from a nested logit model (for
discussions, see McFadden (1999), Herriges and Kling (1999), and Dagsvik and Karlstrom (2005)),
a necessary step for our welfare calculations below. Therefore for the sake of parsimony we use the
conditional logit model.

3.4.2

Dollar Fees

In our benchmark specification (1), client firms’ choices of auditor are influenced by the logarithm
of fees. We base this specification off of the observation that, institutionally, audit fee negotiations
typically involve percentage changes in audit fees rather than absolute dollar changes. It also strikes
as intuitive than an additional, say, $100,000 increment to audit fees would foster a much larger
15

The nested logit collapses to conditional logit if the substitution parameter equals one.

19

response from a small client firm than from a very large one. To examine the sensitivity of the
results to the log-linearity assumption, we also estimate a specification where fees enter in levels
rather than logs. This specification imposes that a dollar of audit fees is equally important to large
and small firms. The non-price preference parameter estimates from this dollar-price specification
are similar to those presented in Table 5. The elasticity estimates are, however, about an eighth the
magnitude of those based on the benchmark log price specification. This is what one would expect
if, in reality, large firms were less sensitive than smaller firms were to a given dollar change in fees,
as the model would attempt to explain this relative indifference by fitting a small coefficient to the
fee level. The log price specification therefore appears to be better able to handle the heterogeneity
in audit fees and client firms’ responses to them that are driven by firm size differences.

3.4.3

Competitor Overlap

Aobdia (2012) documents the empirical regularity that large firms in concentrated industries are
less likely to share auditors, presumably because of concerns about the transmission of proprietary
information through the auditor.16 We therefore created a measure coded as the product of an
indicator for whether firm i is within the top three firms in its industry as defined by four digit SIC,
an indicator for whether auditor j audited at least one other top three firm in the industry, and
a measure of the industry’s concentration (the percentage of industry sales controlled by the top
three firms). When we include this measure in our conditional logit specification, the coefficients
are negative and therefore consistent with the findings of Aobdia (2012). The coefficients are not,
however, statistically significant. This lack of significance appears to be driven by the fact that prior
history of the match between the audit firm and client soaks up variation related to competitive
overlaps. For example, when we estimate demand but exclude the history of firm-client match, the
16

Asker and Ljungqvist (2010) find a similar effect for firm-bank matches.

20

competitive overlap enters significantly for many of the years.

4

Counterfactuals

Having obtained estimates of client firms’ preference parameters, we use them to address the
two aforementioned policy-relevant issues: the effect of increased concentration among audit firms
resulting from the exit of one of the Big 4 and the implementation of mandatory audit firm rotation
at various tenures.
To estimate these counterfactuals, we use the methodology outlined by McFadden (1999). This
involves calculating the expected change in consumer surplus for each audit client firm as the
expected dollar transfer required to make that client indifferent between the unrestricted choice
set of the status quo and the restricted choice set arising under the counterfactuals. We then
sum these estimates of lost surplus across individual clients to find the expected total change in
consumer surplus.
For example, suppose that under the status quo client i chooses the auditor j that yields maximized utility maxj U (Audit f eesij , xij, ij ), and under the counterfactual firm i chooses auditor m
from a restricted choice set that leads to maximized utility maxm U (Audit f eesim , xim, im ). The
change in consumer surplus, Cijm , is the dollar transfer (or, equivalently, the reduction in audit
fees) that would be required to equate the client’s maximum utility under the restricted choice set
with what it obtained under the unrestricted choice set:

max U (Audit f eesij , xij , ij ) = max U (Audit f eesim − Cijm , xim , im ).
j

m

(4)

The total change in consumer surplus for the counterfactual is the sum of Cijm across client firms.
21

Mechanically, to estimate Cijm , for each firm i we draw a vector of type 1 extreme value error
terms—one for each of the Big 4 auditors and one for the outside good. We then compute the utility
client firm i would obtain from each auditor choice using equation (1) by combining the parameter
estimates from Panel A of Table 5, the client firm and auditor characteristics observed in the data,
and the error term draws. The auditor that delivers the largest utility of the five choices is then
client firm i’s simulated choice for that error draw. We next restrict the choice set for each client
(i.e., depending on the counterfactual being estimated, remove one of the Big 4 auditors or remove
the client’s prior auditor based on tenure) and calculate the maximum utility that the client would
receive under the restricted choice set. Then we solve for the Cijm that equates these two maximized
utilities; given that dollar fees enter into utility in log form, Cijm is simply the exponent of the
difference in maximized utilities between the unrestricted and restricted choice sets normalized by
the estimated marginal willingness to pay. We repeat this procedure 1,000 times for each client
firm, each time with new error vector, and then average the lost surplus values of Cijm from each
simulation to compute E[Cijm ]. These values in hand, we aggregate these estimates across client
firms to calculate the expected total change in consumer surplus in each counterfactual.
Computing the expected changes in consumer surplus as above using the observed audit fees in
the data (or, more precisely, our estimates of audit fees given those observed in existing matches)
effectively assumes that there is no supply-side response in the counterfactual scenarios. That is,
it estimates the surplus lost by client firms if one of the Big 4 exits or if auditor rotation becomes
mandatory while holding the fees charged by the remaining auditors fixed. In this sense, it estimates
the pure demand-side effect of the counterfactuals. However, it seems likely that auditors might
respond in these counterfactual worlds by changing their fees. (E.g., if one of the Big 4 exits,
the resulting reduction in competition is likely to result in the remaining auditors charging higher
fees within any given match.) Therefore we estimate two changes in expected surplus for each
22

counterfactual scenario: a pure demand-side effect that holds auditors’ price responses fixed, and a
second that estimates and takes into account auditors’ strategic price responses in the counterfactual
scenario.

4.1

Exit of a Big 4 Audit Firm

The first counterfactual involves the exit of a Big 4 audit firm. We estimate the total expected
changes in consumer surplus that would be caused by exit of each of the Big 4 auditors (in isolation,
of course). We compute separate estimates using the demand parameters from each of the 2008,
2009, and 2010 samples to check the consistency of the results across subsamples.
Table 9, Panel A presents the estimated changes in consumer surplus when audit fees are held
constant—that is, without allowing for any strategic price response from the remaining auditors.
The estimated total changes in consumer surplus range from an approximately $1.3 billion loss from
the exit of Deloitte Touche to up to a $1.8 billion loss for the disappearance of PricewaterhouseCoopers. These losses are substantial; for all of the Big 4, the estimated changes in consumer surplus
range from 49% to 63% of each firm’s total annual audit fees for our sample. The largest changes
relative to total fees are for KPMG, 53–66%, and the smallest are for PricewaterhouseCoopers,
49–57%.
Panel B presents mean client-level changes in consumer surplus under the counterfactuals along
with their correlations with client characteristics. As expected, the expected changes in consumer
surplus are significantly larger for clients of an exiting audit firm than for non-clients. For clients the
mean expected decrease in consumer surplus ranges from $1.3 to $2.1 million, while for non-clients
the mean expected change in consumer surplus ranges from $14,000 to $30,000. With respect to
correlations with firm characteristics, for clients of an exiting audit firm the expected changes in

23

consumer surplus correlate with client size (correlation coefficients between 0.24 and 0.69), audit
fees (0.61–0.85), and tenure with the audit firm (0.17–0.31). For non-clients, the expected changes
in consumer surplus are basically uncorrelated with client characteristics; that is, they are primarily
driven by the error term, ij .
These estimates are subject to several caveats. One factor that could mitigate the size of the
estimated losses is the possibility that audit teams from the exiting auditor move en masse with their
clients to the remaining auditors. Presumably, some of the match-specific utility would move with
the teams even if the audit firm disappears as a legal entity.17 On the other hand, there are multiple
reasons why these estimates might understate the true loss of client firms’ consumer surplus. For
one, the estimates do not include lost surplus tied to non-audit services (such as consulting and
tax services) audit firms might also provide to their clients. Additionally, the estimates exclude
any surplus lost by an exiting auditor’s domestic private or international clients. Finally, these
estimates are calculated based on the disappearance of a Big 4 audit firm from clients’ choice sets
for only one year. If the persistence of auditor-client matches is solely due to switching costs,
then our single-year estimates should capture most of the present value of the change in consumer
surplus, as once the switch is forced by the counterfactual Big 4 exit, no further losses of this
type would be induced. However, given any persistence in auditor-client matches due instead to
unobserved heterogeneity and match-specific capital, the estimates reflect only the first year’s loss
of the surplus created by these match-specific components; the permanent demise of a Big 4 audit
firm may impose similar losses for years into the future.
17

Consistent with this possibility, Blouin, Grein, and Rountree (2007) find that some Arthur Andersen clients
followed their Andersen audit teams to the remaining Big 4 auditors.

24

4.2

Introduction of Mandatory Audit Firm Rotation

The second counterfactual scenario involves the implementation of mandatory audit firm rotation.
To estimate the expected change in consumer surplus in this case, we calculate the dollar transfer
required to make clients indifferent to the removal of their current auditor from their choice set
once the client-auditor match has lasted beyond the statutory maximum allowed. We compute
separate estimates for different possible statutory maximum tenures, running from four through
ten years. We also again compute estimates using each of the sets of estimated demand parameters
from 2008, 2009, and 2010.
Table 10, Panel A presents these expected total changes in consumer surplus. They are significantly larger than expected changes that arise from the disappearance of one of the Big 4,
ranging from $2.4–2.8 billion if rotation is mandatory after ten years to $4.3–5.1 billion if rotation
is mandatory after four years. (The estimated lost surplus is larger for shorter horizons because a
greater number of matches are affected.) The observed persistence of auditor-client matches results
in mandatory audit firm rotation producing larger changes in consumer surplus because the former
affects a larger proportion of clients.
Panel B contains mean client-level changes in consumer surplus under the mandatory audit
firm rotation counterfactuals and their correlations with client characteristics. Similarly to the
aggregate estimates presented in Panel A, the client-level means decrease as the horizon increases,
as more client firms are left unaffected by the mandate. If rotation is mandatory after four years,
the mean expected change in consumer surplus ranges from $800,000 to $1 million depending upon
the year the mandate would have been imposed. If rotation is mandatory after ten years, the
mean expected change in consumer surplus ranges from about $450,000 to $550,000. The expected
changes in surplus also correlate with client characteristics, with the highest correlations for audit
25

fees (0.50–0.75), followed by tenure with the audit firm (0.34–0.57), and then client size (0.14–0.47).
Note that even though no auditors exit the market in this counterfactual scenario, mandatory
auditor rotation implies an increase in market concentration just as the Big 4 exit scenario does.
This is because the auditor that is forced out due to rotation is necessarily removed from its
formerly matched client firm’s choice set. If the remaining eligible auditors recognize they now face
less competition when negotiating over audit fees with the client firm, this may lead to higher fees.
The lost surplus estimates in Table 10 do not incorporate any such pricing response, focusing only
on the demand-side consequences of mandatory rotation. Below, however, as we also do with the
Big 4 exit counterfactual, we estimate the expected size of the supply-side audit fee (i.e., pricing)
responses of the remaining competing auditors and compute the consequences of this response for
client firms’ consumer surplus.
An alternative interpretation of these estimates is that they represent what managers (as opposed to shareholders) are willing to pay in order to avoid switching auditors and the estimates
therefore represent agency costs. Under this interpretation, long tenures lead to a loss of auditor
independence that managers exploit for their private benefit. Prior literature, however, does not
provide support for the idea that auditor independence decreases over longer tenures. In fact, several studies find that audit failures are more likely to occur during the early years of tenure (e.g.,
Carcello and Nagy (2004) and Geiger and Raghunandan (2002), and others find that audit quality
appears to increase over auditor tenure (e.g., Chen, Lin, and Lin (2008), Ghosh and Moon (2005),
and Myers, Myers, and Omer (2003)). We therefore interpret these estimates as representing a
change in consumer surplus. Nevertheless, as we noted above, there may also be social benefits
from imposing mandatory rotation. Our estimates serve to quantify the costs such mandates impose on client firms—costs that any social benefits would have to be weighed against in evaluating

26

mandatory rotation policies.

4.3

Supply Side Price Response

As we have discussed, the counterfactual changes in surplus computed above hold audit fees fixed,
isolating the surplus changes due to demand-side effects only. In this section, we estimate what
the supply-side responses might be under the counterfactual scenarios and quantify their additional
impact on client firms’ expected surplus.
To estimate the supply response, we first note that both counterfactual scenarios involve reductions in competition. In standard oligopoly models, reductions in competition—resulting from
the actual exit of one of the market competitors in one counterfactual and the de facto exit of a
client firm’s former auditor (at least for that client firm) in the other—lead to higher prices. Our
estimate of the counterfactual audit fee changes due to the supply response works off this logic.
Specifically, we estimate in our sample how changes in auditor competition for clients within an
industry relates to average audit fee changes in that industry.
A typical concern when estimating such relationships is that market structure and prices are
both endogenous outcomes, making causal inference difficult. However, we are fortunate in that we
have (and indeed have already used for demand estimation purposes above) an exogenous change
in competition at the industry level, the collapse of Arthur Andersen. Thus we can identify the
causal relationship between competition and fees by estimating the semi-elasticity of audit fees
in 2002 with respect to the percent share of industry total assets audited by Arthur Andersen in
2001 based on three-digit SIC. (This regression is presented in Table A.3.)18 We estimate this
18

We estimate this effect for the period prior to the implementation of mandatory internal control audits under
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Hence, variation in fees represents changes in industry concentration as opposed to changes
in demand due to increased regulatory requirements. For a discussion, see Feldman (2006) and Kohlbeck, Mayhew,
Murphy, and Wilkins (2008).

27

semi-elasticity using ordinary least squares and controlling for the standard audit fee determinants.
This semi-elasticity is that audit fees rise 0.15% for each one percentage point of total industry
assets that had been audited by Arthur Andersen before its collapse.
Table 11 presents estimates of the annual increase in total audit fees that would occur if a
Big 4 audit firm were to disappear. These estimates range from $335 million for the disappearance
of KPMG in 2010 to $533 million for the disappearance of PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2008. Table 12 presents estimates of annual increases in total audit fees that would occur under each of the
mandatory audit firm rotation horizons. These estimated annual increases range from $772 million
for the implementation of ten year rotation in 2010 to $1.34 billion for four year rotation in 2008.
The estimated annual increases in fees are over twice as large under this scenario as in the Big 4
exit case, which is to be expected given that mandatory audit firm rotation would affect a larger
number of client firms.
When combined with the estimated demand-side losses in Table 9, and Table 10, the supply
response implies estimated initial surplus losses among client firms totalling in the neighborhood of
$1.6–2.3 billion in the case of exit of one of the Big 4 auditors and around $3.1–3.5 billion (ten-year
maximum tenure) or $5.6–6.4 billion (four-year maximum tenure) in the case of mandatory auditor
rotation.
New entry into the market would determine the extent that such annual increases in total audit
fees persist into the future. Absent new entry, these increases in annual audit fees could persist
indefinitely. The limited entry response subsequent to the collapse of Arthur Andersen, not to
mention the revealed reluctance among policymakers to force any further consolidation through
legal action, suggests that such increases would likely be quite persistent.

28

Conclusion

The audit industry receives considerable policy attention for several reasons. Using estimates of
publicly listed firms’ demand for audit services, we have evaluated the consequences for client firms
of two important policy-related scenarios: further concentration of the audit industry due to exit
of one of the Big 4 audit firms, and the imposition of mandatory auditor rotation.
The estimated parameters of our model, which fit the data quite well, imply that both scenarios
would impose substantial costs. The direct impacts on client firms’ choice sets along imply, surplus
losses of about $1.5 billion for exit of one of the Big 4 and $2.5–5.0 billion for mandatory auditor
rotation (shorter mandated maximum tenures create larger losses of surplus). Factoring in the
expected supply responses of the remaining auditors–increases in fees due to decreased competition–
raises these figure by another 25 percent. Moreover, there are several reasons why these estimated
losses are likely to be conservative, including that these figures are for initial one-year surplus losses,
while in reality both the loss of choice and increase in fees from less competition are likely to be
persistent.
While we have used our framework to address two of the more salient policy questions in
the audit industry, we believe our empirical framework can be applied to other sets of economic
questions about the industry, and purchased business services more broadly. Furthermore, we
see potential gains from analyzing the audit industry in a more explicit economic framework that
separates demand from supply effects to better understand the sources and consequences of shifts
in the industry’s market conditions.

Table 3: Validation of Arthur Andersen supply shifter
This table presents regressions that validate the use of the disappearance of Arthur Andersen as a
supply shifter. The dependent variable in all of the regressions is the log growth in audit fees from
2001 to the relevant year. The supply shifter is Arthur Andersen’s share of the industry in 2001,
with industries based on three-digit SIC codes. Standard errors are in parentheses and clustered
at the three-digit SIC level. Panel A presents results for all firms and Panel B presents results for
firms that were not clients of Arthur Andersen in 2001.

Table 4: Client mergers as a supply shifter
This table presents regressions that validate the use of client mergers as a supply shifter. The
dependent variable in all of the regressions is the natural logarithm of audit fees. The supply
shifter is the ratio of merged to total assets in an industry based on the three-digit SIC codes for
the prior year. Columns (1) and (2) present regressions in which the shifter is for the prior year.
Columns (3) and (4) validate the shifter by setting it forward three years. Standard errors are in
parentheses and clustered at the firm-level.

Table 5: Demand estimation
This table presents estimates of demand and price elasticity for SEC registrants over the period
2008–2010. Panel A presents annual estimates of the demand for the Big 4 audit firms. The
regressions are estimated using conditional logit with the outside good being the non-Big 4 audit
firms. Ln(Predicted Fees) is the natural logarithm of predicted fees for each of the Big 4 audit firms.
E&Y, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC are brand fixed effects for each of the Big 4 audit firms. Ln(Assets)
is the natural logarithm of the client’s total assets, Ln(Segments) is the natural logarithm of the
client’s industrial segments, Foreign Sales is the percentage of the clients sales generated outside
of the US, Debt is the ratio of short- and long-term debt to total assets for the client, ROA is the
client’s return on assets, Inventory + Receivables is the client’s ratio of inventory and receivables
to total assets, and Payables is the ratio of the client’s account payables to total assets. Ln(Years
Client) is the number of years that the SEC registrant has been a client of the audit firm, and
Not Prior Client is an indicator variable for whether the SEC registrant was not a client of the
audit firm in the prior three years. Not tabulated are interactions between the brand fixed effects
and indicators for the Fama-French ten industries. Data on client characteristics are taken from
Compustat. Panel B presents annual mean price elasticity estimates by audit firm for all clients.
Panel C presents annual mean price elasticity estimates by audit firm conditional on being a client
of the audit firm in the prior year.

choice in 2002 for firms that were clients of Arthur Andersen in 2001; column (2) presents estimates
of audit firm choice in 2001 for all firms; column 3 presents estimates of audit firm choice in 2002 for
firms that were not clients of Arthur Andersen in 2001. For all three regressions, the outside good
consists of the non-Big 4 audit firms. Ln(Predicted Fees) is the natural logarithm of predicted fees
for each of the Big 4 audit firms. E&Y, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC are brand fixed effects for each of
the Big 4 audit firms. Ln(Assets) is the natural logarithm of the client’s total assets, Ln(Segments)
is the natural logarithm of the client’s industrial segments, Foreign Sales is the percentage of the
clients sales generated outside of the US, Debt is the ratio of short- and long-term debt to total
assets for the client, ROA is the client’s return on assets, Inventory + Receivables is the client’s ratio
of inventory and receivables to total assets, and Payables is the ratio of the client’s account payables
to total assets. Not tabulated are interactions between the brand fixed effects and indicators for the
Fama-French ten industries. Panel B presents price elasticity estimates for former Arthur Andersen
clients based on the parameter estimates from the three regressions presented in Panel A.

Table 9: Disappearance of a Big 4 audit firm with no supply response
The table presents expected changes in consumer surplus if one of the Big 4 audit firms disappeared.
Estimates are based on Table 5 coefficient estimates for 2008, 2009, and 2010. For the disappearance
of each of the Big 4 audit firms, we estimate the expected change in consumer surplus, Cijm , for
each firm i. To do so, we draw vectors of type 1 extreme value error terms—one for each of the
Big 4 auditors and one for the outside good. For each vector draw, we combine in equation (1) the
parameter estimates from the demand estimation along with the the firm-auditor characteristics
and the error term draw to calculate the utility that client would receive from choosing each of the
Big 4 auditors and the outside good. We then pick the audit firm that leads to maximum utility
under this unrestricted choice set. We next restrict the choice set for each client (i.e., remove one
of the Big 4 auditors) and calculate the maximum utility that the client would have received under
the restricted choice set. Then, we solve for the change in consumer surplus Cijm that equates the
maximum utilities. For each client, we repeat this procedure 1,000 times and take the average of
the required dollar transfer to create E[Cijm ]. Panel A presents the estimates of the expected total
change in consumer surplus if each of the Big 4 disappears. Panel B presents the firm-level mean
change in consumer surplus and correlations of the firm-level change in consumer surplus with firm
size, audit fees, and tenure with auditor.

Table 10: Mandatory audit firm rotation with no supply response
The table presents expected changes in consumer surplus if mandatory audit firm rotation were to
be implemented after four through ten years. Estimates are based on Table 5 coefficient estimates
for 2008, 209, and 2010, and are denominated in billions of US dollars. For the implementation of
mandatory audit firm rotation at various tenures, we remove an auditor from the client’s choice set
if the length of the auditor-client relationship was equal to or greater than the specified number of
years that require mandatory rotation and then estimate the expected change in consumer surplus,
Cijm , for each firm i. To do so, we draw vectors of type 1 extreme value error terms—one for each of
the Big 4 auditors and one for the outside good. For each vector draw, we combine in equation (1)
the parameter estimates from the demand estimation along with the the firm-auditor characteristics
and the error term draw to calculate the utility that client would receive from choosing each of
the Big 4 auditors and the outside good. We then pick the audit firm that leads to maximum
utility under this unrestricted choice set. We next restrict the choice set for each client based
on mandatory audit firm rotation and calculate the maximum utility that the client would have
received under the restricted choice set. Then, we solve for the change in consumer surplus Cijm
that equates the maximum utilities. For each client, we repeat this procedure 1,000 times and take
the average of the required dollar transfer to create E[Cijm ]. Panel A presents the estimates of the
expected total change in consumer surplus for mandatory audit firm rotation. Panel B presents the
firm-level mean change in consumer surplus and correlations of the firm-level change in consumer
surplus with firm size, audit fees, and tenure with auditor.

Table 11: Supply response for the disappearance of a Big 4 audit firm
This table presents estimates of the increase in total annual audit fees if one of the Big 4 audit firms
disappears. To calculate this expected supply side response, we estimate the semi-elasticity of audit
fees in 2002 with respect to the percent share of industry total assets audited by Arthur Andersen
in 2001 based on three-digit SIC. This semi-elasticity is a 0.15% increase in audit fees for each one
percentage point of total industry assets audited by Arthur Andersen. For each counterfactual, we
calculate by three-digit SIC the percentage of total assets audited by the disappearing Big 4 audit
firm. For each client, we then calculate the expected increase in annual audit fees based on the
client’s actual audit fees times the semi-elasticity times the percentage of industry assets audited
by the disappearing firm. The columns present sums by year denominated in billions of US$.

APPENDIX

A

Predicting audit fees

To evaluate the best method to predict audit fees, we compared six regression methods that are
commonly used in forecasting applications: ordinary least squares ols, lasso regression lasso,
ridge regression ridge, partial least squares pls, recursive partitioning rpart, and randomForest
rfor.19 For each auditor-year pair, we used the six regression methods to generate RMSEs using
100 repetitions of five-fold cross-validations. As predictors of audit fees, we include the natural
logarithm of total assets, the natural logarithm of industrial segments, the percentage of foreign
sales, the ratio of debt to total assets, the ratio of inventory and receivables to total assets, the
ratios of payables to total assets, the number of years as client of the audit firm, indicator variables
for the Fama-French ten industry classification, the ratio of three-digit SIC industry assets audited
by Arthur Andersen in 2001, and the ratio of three-digit SIC industry assets merged in the prior
year. Table A.1 presents the distribution of the minimum RMSEs by regression method for each
auditor-year pair. As shown in the far right column, randomForest has the highest number of
minimum RMSEs for each auditor-year pair. We therefore use randomForest to predict the audit
fees that we use in our demand estimations.

For a description of these methods, see Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009).
