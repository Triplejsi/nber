ABSTRACT
This paper studies the effect of transport infrastructure on the real exchange rate (RER) and reaches
two relatively strong conclusions. First, while the list of robust determinants of the RER is not long,
transport infrastructure belongs to that list. Many other potential determinants proposed in the literature,
such as net foreign asset position or terms of trade, turn out to be not robust. Second, in terms of economic
significance, the infrastructure effect follows closely the well-known Balassa-Samuelson effect and
is one of the most important explanatory variables for RER movements, especially in developing countries.

Introduction
The real exchange rate (RER) is a key relative price that directly a¤ects many other relative prices

across countries. The real exchange rate is also often a source of international tensions -witness the
intense debate about whether the RER of the Chinese currency is undervalued. In this paper, we argue
that the existing literature on the RER may have missed some economically important determinants.
More concretely, we study the possible role of transportation infrastructure, especially roads and
railways, in a¤ecting the value of a country’s RER. We reach two strong conclusions. First, while the
list of robust determinants of the RER is not long, transport infrastructure belongs to that list. Many
other potential determinants proposed in the literature turn out to be not robust. Second, in terms of
economic signi…cance, the infrastructure e¤ect follows closely the well-known Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect
and is one of the most important explanatory variables for RER movements.
Since the theory of purchasing power parity (PPP) was formulated by Cassell (1918), the literature
has identi…ed additional determinants of the RER (which could be understood as fundamental factors

underlying deviations of the real exchange rate from the PPP). In a widely cited survey of the literature
on the real exchange rate up to 1996, Rogo¤ (1996) singled out three theories, presumably representing
the three most prominent determinants of the real exchange rate beyond PPP. The …rst and perhaps
the most well-known theory is the Balassa-Samuelson (BS) e¤ect (Balassa, 1964; and Samuelson, 1964),
which postulates that a country that exhibits a faster increase in the productivity of its tradable sector
relative to its non-tradable sector, compared to the relative productivity increase of other countries,
should experience an appreciation of its real exchange rate. Since high-income countries are more
likely to have experienced a faster increase in the relative productivity of their tradable sectors during
their development process, the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect is also often taken to imply that the real
exchange rate tends to be higher in higher-income countries. It is important to note, however, that
the positive correlation between income and real exchange rate could also result from factors other
than the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect. In particular, if high-income countries have a higher capital-tolabor ratio than low-income countries, and capital cannot ‡ow freely across countries, the wage rate
tends to be systematically higher in high-income countries. Because the nontradable sector tends to
be more labor intensive, the relative price of nontradable goods and hence the real exchange rate tend
to be higher in high-income countries (Kravis and Lipsey, 1983; and Bhagwati,1984). The second
important determinant of the real exchange rate, the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect, postulates that because
government spending tends to fall disproportionately on domestic non-tradable goods and services,
the real exchange rate tends to rise with government consumption (Froot and Rogo¤, 1991). The third
e¤ect singled out by Rogo¤ (1996) is a possible e¤ect of current account imbalance on the real exchange
rate. A voluminous empirical literature has tried to test these hypotheses or estimate the empirical
relationship between the real exchange rate and its determinants. According to Rogo¤ (1996), there
is considerable empirical support, though not unanimous support, for both the Balassa-Samuelson
e¤ect and the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect, but much weaker evidence in favor of the current account imbalance
e¤ect.1
Perhaps no one takes the job of ascertaining the determinants of the real exchange rate more seriously than the International Monetary Fund, which needs to provide periodic assessments on whether
a country’s exchange rate deviates from the long-run equilibrium, using a methodology that can stand
up to scrutiny by both academics and more importantly, vigilant member governments. For this reason, well-trained IMF economists carefully comb the literature on the exchange rate determination
before settling down on its preferred model. In the o¢ cial document describing its preferred model
(the equilibrium real exchange rate approach), the IMF (2006) lists the following six fundamentals:
net foreign assets, productivity di¤erential (between tradable and nontradable sectors), terms of trade,
government consumption, restrictions on international trade, and, for centrally planned or transition
economies, the share of government-controlled prices in the CPI basket.2 A survey of the exisiting
1 There is a separate literature examining deviations of the real exchange rate from either the law of one price or
purchasing power parity (e.g., Engel and Rogers, 1996; Parsley and Wei, 1996; Engel, 1999, and many others).
2 The o¢ cial IMF methodology on exchange rate assessments (IMF 2006) also considers two other approaches that do
not involve a direct econometric estimation of exchange rate determinants. One - the macroeconomic balance approach
- is to compute a current account norm, and to ask whether the real exchange rate needs to appreciate or depreciate

literature suggests that transport infrastructure has not been considered a determinant of the RER.
How can construction and improvement of roads and railways a¤ect the RER? We argue that
infrastructure improvement within a country tends to introduce more competition among …rms operating in the country. Competition can foster a reduction in the price level. If the infrastructure
improvement (and hence the price reduction) is faster in the country relative to the rest of the world,
there would be a faster reduction in the overall price level and hence a reduction in the country’s
RER. This e¤ect could be quantitatively important as infrastructure improvement tends to progress
at very di¤erent speeds in di¤erent sets of countries. In the …rst three decades after World War II,
massive road construction and other infrastructure projects in the United States, Western Europe, and
other developed countries tended to widen the gap between their internal transport costs and those
of developing countries such as China, India, and Brazil. In comparison, in the last three decades,
many emerging markets have embarked on an expansive e¤ort to improve their roads and other infrastructure, while many developed countries have slowed down their infrastructure upgrading. Indeed,
even among emerging market economies, China has engaged in the most extensive road and railway
construction during 1989-2010, with a cumulative increase of over 400% in road density (length of
paved roads and railroads per square kilometers). Other countries with major improvements in transport infrastructure include Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and Pakistan. Empirically, we will show that the
infrastructure e¤ect on the RER is approximately of the same order as the income e¤ect (a proxy
that encompasses the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect), and is quantitatively more important than the FrootRogo¤ e¤ect. Furthermore, a relatively demanding robustness check (the Bayesian model averaging)
indicates that transport infrastructure belongs to a very short list of robust determinants of the real
exchange rate. Many other variables proposed in the literature, such as net foreign assets, restrictions
on international trade, and terms of trade, do not survive the robustness checks.
If transport infrastructure is an economically important determinant of the real exchange rate, it
has important implications for economic policies. For example, if one uses an empirical exchange rate
model that does not take into account the role of infrastructure (think of the o¢ cial IMF approach
to assess the equilibrium exchange rate as explained in IMF (2006)), one is likely to mis-label countries with an above-average improvement in transport infrastructure as having an under-valued real
exchange rate. As another example, for a country that wishes to improve its external competitiveness
but is stuck in a currency union, improving its internal transport infrastructure - to the extent there
is still scope to do so - is an alternative to devaluing its exchange rate.
It is useful to point out that the e¤ect of better infrastructure on the RER is di¤erent from the
e¤ect of reducing international trading costs. Indeed, in our model, lower cross-border trade barriers
have an ambiguous e¤ect on the RER. In the empirics, the e¤ect of greater trade openness on the RER
is not statistically signi…cant either.
in order to close the gap between the current account norm and the actual current account. The other - the external
sustainability approach - uses assumptions about a country’s potential growth rate, in‡ation rate, and rates of return
on external assets and liabilities, and asks what the country’s real exchange rate needs to be so that its net foreign asset
position as a share of GDP can be stabilized.

3

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 uses a model to illustrate the mechanism
through which better transport infrastructure a¤ects the real exchange rate. Section 3 presents the
empirical estimation and tests. After presenting some panel regression evidence on the association
between road density and RER, we apply a Bayesian model averaging method to select robust determinants of the RER. We also report an instrumental variable approach to ascertain causality and an
additional set of robustness checks, including results from various sub-samples and those from across
regions within a single country. Finally, Section 4 provides concluding remarks.

Model
In this section, we formalize the connection between transport infrastructure and the real exchange

rate. This will guide our subsequent empirical research.

2.1

Benchmark
We extend the model of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) to having multiple regions in each country.

Consider a two-country world: Home and Foreign. Suppose there are N and N regions in Home
and Foreign, respectively. Consumers in all regions have an identical preference over a continuum of
di¤erentiated varieties indexed by i 2

indexes the degree of product di¤erentiation between the varieties. We assume that

the aggregate income of consumers is large enough so that consumers have positive demand for the
numeraire. Consider a representative consumer in region A, the inverse demand for each variety i is
given by

We assume that labor is the only factor of production and is inelastically supplied in a competitive
market in each region. Furthermore, we assume that one unit of numeraire good is produced by one
unit of labor and its market is competitive. The last assumption implies that the wage equals one in
all regions3 . Entry in the di¤erentiated product sector is costly as each …rm has to pay some start-up
costs. Subsequent production exhibits constant returns to scale at marginal cost c (recall that w = 1),
which is drawn from a common and known distribution G( ) with support on [0; cM ] . Firms learn
about their cost level only after making the irreversible investment fE for entry. If …rms can cover
their sunk costs by selling di¤erentiated goods to consumers, they survive; otherwise, they exit the
market.
Markets in di¤erent regions are segmented. There exists a per-unit trade cost, for instance delivery
cost, for a …rm in Home region A to sell goods in Home region B or Foreign region F. We let
the trade cost from region k to region j.

We need an assumption on the geography of the regions in the two countries to keep the algebra
simple. Let all regions in Home be located on a circle, and all regions in Foreign be located on a
di¤erent circle (as indicated in Figure 1). To go from one region to another region in the same country,
one must go through the center of the country, which is OH for Home and OF for Foreign, respectively.
For example, for a …rm in Home region A to sell its products in Home region B’s market, the goods
must …rst be shipped from region A to Home center OH then to region B. Due to the equal length
from any point on the circle to the center, the trade costs for any pair of regions within a country are
equal, i.e.,

kh

takes the same value for any two regions k and h. We use

within-country trade cost between any two Home regions, and

1

1

to denote this common

for the trade cost between any two

Foreign regions. To sell in a foreign market, a …rm …rst must ship the good to the center of the …rm’s
own country, then to the center of the foreign country, and …nally to a foreign regional market. For
example, consider a …rm from Home region A that wishes to export to Foreign region C. It must ship
its product …rst from A to Home center OH , then to Foreign center OF before reaching Foreign region
C. Given the assumption on the geography, the international trading costs are the same from any home
region to any foreign region. We use
Foreign, and

2

2

to denote the variable cost for a …rm in Home to export to

for the variable trading cost for a …rm in Foreign to export to Home.

2

and

2

can

potentially be di¤erent as the two countries may have di¤erent tari¤ rates and other border costs.
Note that international trading costs in general are a¤ected by domestic trading costs as well.
We capture this by assuming that

2

and

2

are each an increasing function of both

1

and

1.

We

intentionally represent Home by a smaller circle, suggesting that Home is small relative to the rest of
the world. If Home is relatively small, the international trade costs mainly depend on international
shipping and insurance costs, border costs and maybe trade costs within Foreign, whereas Home’s
internal trade costs will play a relatively small role in the overall international trading cost. Then a
change in

1

has only a negligible e¤ect on

with respect to a change in

1

and

2.

In other words, the elasticities of

Now we discuss some comparative statics of changing the trade cost:
(i) If Home’s internal trade cost

1

declines while all other trade costs remain constant, by (2.6)

and (2.12), we clearly see that the CPI in region h is a decreasing function in
increasing function in

1 ).

(and hence an

1

Thus, as Home’s internal trade cost falls, region h’s CPI drops. The result

is intuitive. A lower Home internal trade cost induces more local …rms (those previously selling only
locally) to enter Home markets. Otherwise, given the same level of competition in all Home regions,
they would have earned higher pro…ts in each Home region. In other words, all regional markets in
Home become more competitive after a decline in

1.

As a result, the local CPI in any Home region

falls.
(Note, however, that the number of entrants from region h could either go up or down due to
two opposing forces. On the one hand, a decline in

1

reduces …rms’ marginal costs which in turn

may yield higher pro…ts. More …rms may choose to enter the market. On the other hand, a decline in
1

also makes it easier for …rms from regions outside h to operate businesses in region h; the number

of …rms from other Home regions may rise which crowds out some unproductive local …rms. Because
these two forces go in the opposite directions, the net e¤ect of a lower

1

on the number of producing

…rms in a given region is ambiguous.)

where the inequality holds because we analyze some reasonable solutions (chD > 0) in this model. By
(2.12), as the within-Home trade cost declines, Foreign regional CPI rises. Here is the reason. Suppose,
at some point, a decline in

to reduce Foreign regional price levels. This cannot be an equilibrium, because …rms in Foreign are
now facing tougher markets in both Home and Foreign markets and some of them are bound to quit.

Foreign region, the local CPI rises.

where the inequality holds because in this paper we analyze the reasonable solutions (cfD > 0). Then
we can show that as the international trade cost faced by Home …rms declines, Home regional CPI
falls. Why? Although the change in the international trade cost will not directly a¤ect competitions
in Home regional markets, it will in‡uence the Home local CPI indirectly. As Home …rms face lower
export trading costs, more Home …rms export. Taking into account a higher level of export pro…t for a
given level of productivity, more Home …rms will choose to produce which leads to greater competition
in all Home regional markets. As a result, Home regional CPI falls.
Similar to (i)’s analysis, the number of entrants from a speci…c region may decline since local
…rms may be crowded out by competitors from other Home regions.
Based on an intuition similar to the case in (i), we can show that Foreign CPI tends to rise after
a fall in Home-to-Foreign trading cost

hence markups decrease. However, due to the decline in the domestic trade cost, for …rms who have
business in other Home markets, they are facing a reduction in their marginal costs, which potentially
increases …rms’markups. The net e¤ect is ambiguous.
Some papers in the literature study the change in …rms’ markups after a decline in the trade
cost. Using Indian data, De Loecker et al. (2012) empirically …nd that markups rise after input tari¤
liberalization. Their paper assumes that all …rms use tradable good input in production while this is
not the assumption in our paper. If we allow the decline in the trade cost

1

to also lower the marginal

cost for …rms that only sell products locally, we can show that the change in the markups of those local
…rms now becomes ambiguous.6 The logic is the same as in our previous analysis: the e¤ect from a
decline in the marginal cost may o¤set the e¤ect from a higher competition in the markets. The result
in De Loecker et al. (2012) potentially implies that, for Indian …rms, the direct e¤ect from a decline
in the marginal cost dominates the competition e¤ect.
Arkolakis et al. (2012) theoretically show that, although markups vary across …rms, the distribution of markups is invariant to changes in the trade cost. Their result is clearly functional-form
dependent. However, two countervailing forces behind this stark neutrality result are intuitive. As the
trade cost falls, exporting …rms become less e¢ cient on average, which leads them to lower markups.
On the other hand, more local …rms exit due to higher competition. Since those …rms who exit are
the least e¢ cient …rms, this tends to increase the markups. The net e¤ect on markups is ambiguous.
In Arkolakis et al. (2012), the two e¤ects o¤set completely under speci…c assumptions and the distribution of markups is invariant to any changes in the trade cost. Although we do not obtain the same
neutrality result in our paper, we share the same intuition on the change in the threshold of …rms’
entry chD , which in turn leads to the same argument on …rms’markups.
A number of extensions to the basic model are developed in Appendices C, D, and E, including
endogenous wages, and an introduction of additional channels (innovations, and lower costs of traded
inputs) through which better transport infrastructure can lower the value of the real exchange rate.

Empirical Evidence
We now investigate the empirical relationship between transport infrastructure and the RER. We

proceed in four steps. First, we augment existing empirical models on the RER by including countrylevel infrastructure as an additional regressor. While we present conventional panel regressions with
country and year …xed e¤ects, our primary focus will be to select robust determinants by a Bayesian
Model Averaging (BMA) procedure. This is essentially a rigorous horse race between the transport
infrastructure and other potential determinants of the RER. Second, to ensure that the association
between roads and the RER is not driven by reverse causality or other endogeneity issues, we also
employ an instrumental variable approach. Third, we report additional robustness checks including

other shocks such as a productivity increase, we can show that markup rises unambiguously.

conducting the analysis for various subsamples and examining the connection between roads and the
RER across di¤erent regions within a country. Finally, we use some …rm-level pro…t data to shed light
on possible mechanisms through which transport infrastructure a¤ects the RER.

3.1

Initial evidence
In the …rst part of the empirical analysis, we check whether better infrastructure is associated

with a reduced value of the real exchange rate. To be precise, our speci…cation is the following:
log RERi;t =

+

log Inf rastructurei;t + Xi;t

i;t

+ country&year_f ixed_ef f ects + "i;t

where log RERi;t refers to country i’s real exchange rate in logarithm in year t. log Inf rastructurei;t
is the log of country i0 s road density in year t, which is measured by the total length of railways and
paved roads relative to the area size of the country. Xi;t represents other possible determinants of the
RER, including income per capita, government expenditure/GDP, net foreign asset/GDP, terms of
trade, real interest rate, trade barriers, and relative productivity. The choice of potential determinants
of the real exchange rate is guided by Rogo¤’s survey on the real exchange rate (Rogo¤, 1996) and
the International Monetary Fund in its considered e¤ort to assess the equilibrium value of the real
exchange rate (2006).

3.1.1

Data Description

We start with data for 97 economies over the period from 1980 to 2010. However, as di¤erent variables have di¤erent missing value structures, our panel regressions will be conducted for 61
economies during 1988-2007. A list of countries is provided in Appendix Table F1. The de…nitions
and descriptive statistics for key variables of interest are presented in Table 1, with additional details
including data sources in Appendix Table F2.
Our key outcome variable is a country’s real e¤ective exchange rate (REER), which is a weighted
average of the bilateral real exchange rate with bilateral trade shares as weights, constructed by the
IMF and published in its International Financial Statistics. The REER is de…ned in such a way that
a reduction in value implies that the goods prices in the country become lower relative to the average
goods prices in other countries when the prices are converted into a common currency. Because the
price indices (rather than absolute price levels) are used in the computation, only changes in the REER,
not the absolute values, can be meaningfully compared across countries. (In our regressions, this issue
is controlled for by the inclusion of country …xed e¤ects.)
As a robustness check, we will also examine a bilateral real exchange rate (BRER) relative to the
United States, constructed as CPI(i,t)/[CPI(us, t)*E], where E is the nominal exchange rate in terms
of the units of a country’s currency per US dollar. De…ned in this way, a reduction in country i ’s

14

BRER implies that the goods become cheaper in country i than in the United States when the goods
prices in both countries are expressed in constant US dollars.
Our key regressor is the stock of transport infrastructure. We measure it by road density, or the
total length of paved roads and railroads per square kilometers. The data comes primarily from the
World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) and is supplemented by other sources. In particular, we extend the relatively sparse coverage of China in the WDI and ITF databases by obtaining
more complete road and railway information from the China Transportation and Communications
Yearbooks. Note that the absolute level of road density may not be directly comparable across countries due to di¤erences in geographic and topological features. For example, if a country has more
desert or surface water within its territory (e.g., Australia), even a relatively low road density could
be compatible with a high quality transportation network. In our statistical analysis, we will always
include country …xed e¤ects to account for time-invariant geographic or topographic features.
One potential drawback of the infrastructure measure is that it ignores transportation by surface
water or air. As a robustness check, we also construct another measure of infrastructure: the ratio of
the volume of goods transported by all modes of transport to area size. More precisely, it is the total
volume of goods transported by railways, roads, air and waterways measured in metric tons, times
kilometers traveled, and scaled by the area size. The information on transport volume comes from
the World Bank’s WDI and International Transportation Forum. A key drawback of this data is its
much smaller coverage (22 countries only). Nonetheless, as we will see, this alternative measure of
infrastructure does not alter the statistical relationship between infrastructure and real exchange rate.
To develop some concrete impressions about the magnitude and dispersion of infrastructure
buildup across countries in recent decades, we present, in the upper left graph in Figure 2, the evolution
of road density for China, India, Mexico and the United States, and compare it with income per capita
and government expenditure over GDP. We normalize the values of each variable in 1980 to 100, so
the values in other years can be read as cumulative growth since 1980. For example, the infrastructure
density for India reaches 184 in 2010. This means that India has increased its total length of railways
and paved roads by 84% from 1980 to 2010. Similarly, the infrastructure density for China reaches
501 by 2010, implying a 401% increase from 1980 to 2010.
While the stock of transport infrastructure in the United States barely changes from 1980 to
2010, it exhibits a more visible increase in emerging market economies. China’s infrastructure stock
has increased by leaps and bounds, especially since 2005, when the rate of increase also picked up.
Over the entire 30 year period, the pace of the infrastructure buildup is similar to that of GDP growth.
There are of course variations both across countries and over time within a country.
The upper right graph in Figure 2 presents the evolution of the total volume of goods transported
(from all modes of transportation) for the same four countries. By this measure, the United States
exhibits an increase over time. This likely re‡ects a progressively more intensive use of the existing
transport networks. However, the increasing gap between China and the United States is still striking.
The intensity in the use of the transport network might have increased even faster in China than in
15

the United States, although it could also re‡ect rapid increase in cargo transport by waterways and
air. The lower left graph presents the evolution of income per capita (in constant 2005 international
dollars in PPP, but with the 1980 value normalized to be 100), which is a key determinant of the real
exchange rate as suggested by both the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis and the Kravis-Lipsey-Bhagwati
hypothesis.
The lower right graph presents the evolution of the share of government consumption in GDP,
which is another determinant of the real exchange rate as suggested by Froot and Rogo¤ (1995). As
we can see clearly, this share does not exhibit much increase over time for these countries.
As for the other control variables in the regressions, we are guided by the existing literature on
the determinants of the real exchange rate (see, for example, the surveys by Froot and Rogo¤ 1995;
Rogo¤ 1996; and for developing countries, Edwards 1989; Hinkle and Montiel 1999; Edwards and
Savastano 1999; and Lee 2008). In principle, the CPI-based real e¤ective exchange rate is expected to
depend on the following fundamentals: income per capita, government expenditure, net foreign assets,
commodity terms of trade, real interest rate, trade restriction, and productivity di¤erential. Detailed
data sources of these variables can be found in Table 1.

3.1.2

Initial Panel Regression Results

Table 2 reports panel regression estimations. The regressions include separate country and year
…xed e¤ects. In all regressions, we re-scale all the (non-dummy) regressors by their respective standard
deviations in the sample (which are reported in Table 1). As a result, the regression coe¢ cient on a
given regressor can be interpreted as a percentage change in the real exchange rate if that regressor
is increased by one standard deviation. This allows one to compare easily the relative economic
signi…cance across di¤erent regressors.
In Column 1 of Table 2, the key regressors are log infrastructure, log income, and the ratio of
government expenditure in GDP (plus various …xed e¤ects). The coe¢ cients on both log infrastructure
and log income are statistically signi…cant at the 1% level and have the expected sign. Consistent with
our theory, an improvement in infrastructure by one standard deviation is associated with a decline in
the real exchange rate by 88%. In comparison, a rise in income by one standard deviation is associated
with a rise in the RER by 42%. An increase in government expenditure share by one standard deviation
is associated with an appreciation of the RER by 10%. These estimates suggest that the economic e¤ect
of an infrastructure improvement could be greater than the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect, and probably
more than eight times bigger than the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect.
In Columns 2-4 of Table 2, we expand the list of regressors to include terms of trade, the ratio
of net foreign assets to GDP, the real interest rate, two di¤erent ways to measure cross-border trade
barriers, and a proxy for the relative productivity of the tradable sector. There is some evidence that
a larger net foreign asset position is associated with a higher RER value; a higher real interest rate is
also associated with a higher RER value. Also, there is some evidence that the real exchange rate is
16

lower in a country with a more open trade regime. The coe¢ cient on the relative productivity of the
non-tradable sector is not signi…cant. [If we run a regression without log income, then the coe¢ cient on
relative productivity becomes positive and signi…cant, which is consistent with the Balassa-Samuelson
e¤ect. The regression is not reported to save space.]
In any case, after controlling for these additional regressors, the coe¢ cient on the infrastructure
variable is always negative and signi…cant. Note that in Column 4, the point estimate on log income
is slightly bigger than that on log infrastructure, but the di¤erence is not statistically signi…cant.
This suggests that the infrastructure e¤ect and the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect are comparable. The
coe¢ cients on log infrastructure are always substantially bigger than those on the government spending
share in all regressions. This suggests that the transport infrastructure e¤ect is likely to be economically
more important than the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect. Other potential determinants of the real exchange rate
appear to be even less signi…ciant, either statistically, economically, or both.
To see if the results over a somewhat longer time span are di¤erent, we also implement the same
set of regressions when the data are sampled every third year. The results are reported in Columns
5-8 of Table 2. We note that all qualitative results remain broadly the same as before. In particular,
the coe¢ cients on log infrastructure are always negative and signi…cant.
One way to gauge if and how the main results are a¤ected by possible outliers is to look at
some graphs. In the left column of Figure 3, we present a conditional scatter plot of the log RER
against log infrastructure, based on the regression reported in Column 4 of Table 2. We can see a
negative relationship between the two variables, which is not surprising as the slope simply re‡ects
the coe¢ cient estimate in the regression. Following the practice in empirical labor economics, we can
…lter out potential noises in the following way. First, we assign all data points into 50 equal-width
bins based on the value of the residuals of log infrastructure. Second, for each bin, we compute the
mean value of the residuals of log RER. In the right graph of Figure 3, we plot the mean value of the
residual of log RER in each bin against the mid-value for each bin of the residual of log infrastructure.
As we can see, the two variables are still negatively related. These graphs suggest that the negative
relationship between transport infrastructure and real exchange rate is unlikely to be driven by one or
two outliers.
We might conjecture that the e¤ect of log infrastructure on the RER can be non-linear. Perhaps
at high levels of transport infrastructure, any additional increase in road density may have a smaller
e¤ect on the RER. The right graph of Figure 3 allows us to check visually for the presence of possible non-linear e¤ects. As far as we can see, there is no strong or obvious non-linear e¤ect in the
data. In subsequent discussions, we will assume that the e¤ect of log infrastructure on log RER is
(approximately) linear.

17

3.2

Selecting Robust Determinants by Bayesian Model Averaging
We now perform a relatively demanding type of robustness check by employing Bayesian model

averaging (BMA). Speci…cally, we run a horse race between transport infrastructure and a set of
other variables that the existing literature considers as plausibly important determinants of the real
exchange rate7 . Using Rogo¤ (1996) and the IMF approach to assess the equilibrium exchange rate
(IMF 2006) as a guide, we consider seven such other potential determinants: income level (which re‡ects
both the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect and the demand hypothesis of Bhagwati and Lipsey), government
consumption/GDP (the Froot-Rogo¤ hypothesis), real interest rate, tari¤ rate, relative productivity,
net foreign asset position/GDP, and terms of trade.
To implement the BMA procedure, we …rst take out both the country means and period means of
all variables. By working with only de-meaned variables, we bypass a discussion of whether a particular
country or year …xed e¤ect should be part of the model.
Suppose we treat any linear combination of these eight potential variables as a possible model of
the RER determination; there are 28 = 256 possible models in total. (Note that if a given model has
only a subset of variables, it is equivalent to assigning a zero coe¢ cient to all other variables.) One
can literally run all 256 regressions, and see how often a given variable is statistically signi…cant and
how big the likelihood value is for each regression. The BMA procedure can heuristically be thought
of as a systematic and succinct way to summarize the results from running all these regressions.
We start with a prior on the size of the model (how many variables belong to the true model)
and on the probability that a given variable may be part of the true model for each variable. Let us
say that our prior is that the true model size has exactly …ve variables (we will later show this guess
of the model size is a sensible one), and that any …ve variables out of these eight are ex ante equally
likely to be in the true model. (That is, any given variable has a prior probability of 5/8 of belonging
to the true model.) We report the results from the BMA in this case in Table 3. Column 1 reports
the posterior probability for a given variable to belong to the true model. The variables are ordered in
descending order of the values in this column. Five variables stand out as having a posterior probability
of belonging to the true model that is greater than the prior probability. They are log income, log
infrastructure, government spending share, real interest rate and relative productivity. In fact, for the
…rst four variables, the posterior probability is greater than 99%, far exceeding the prior probability
of 62.5%. In comparison, the …fth variable, relative productivity, has a posterior probability of 65%,
which barely exceeds the prior probability.
The posterior inclusion probability for a given variable takes into account both how many times
the variable is statistically signi…cant across all models, and how likely each of these models is. For
the …rst four variables to have a posterior probability of inclusion of 99% or better, it must mean that
most models that do not include any of the four variables have a low likelihood value. In addition, in
7 Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and Miller (2004) pioneered in applying the BMA methodology to selecting robust
determinants of long-run economic growth.

18

models in which they are included, they are almost always statistically signi…cant.
Columns 2 and 3 report posterior mean and standard deviations for a coe¢ cient conditional on
a given variable being included in the model. We can see that the mean estimates for the …rst four
variables are all more than 2 standard deviations away from zero. The same cannot be said of the
remaining 4 variables. Interestingly, the posterior means for income and infrastructure are very similar
(with the coe¢ cient on log income being slightly larger), and both are much greater than those on
government spending and real interest rate.
Column 4 reports the fraction of times the point estimate of a given coe¢ cient takes on a positive
sign conditional on the variable being included in the model; a value of one means 100% of the times this
occurs. Similarly, Column 5 reports the fraction of the times the point estimate of a given coe¢ cient
takes on a negative sign; a value of 1 means 100% of the times this occurs. We can see that for log
income, government spending, and real interest rate, whenever they are included in the model, their
coe¢ cients are always strictly positive. For log infrastructure, whenever it is included in the model,
its coe¢ cient is always strictly negative.
In the exercises reported in Table 3, we start with a prior on the model size. We can gauge the
appropriateness of this prior by re-doing the exercise with di¤erent priors. In particular, our prior
could be that the number of variables in the true model is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7. In Table 4, we
tabulate the posterior probability of inclusion of these eight variables for various priors on the model
size. For example, in the …rst column corresponding to a prior model size k=2, the BMA procedure
suggests that, ex post, …ve variables have a posterior probability of inclusion that is greater than the
prior probability (which is 2/8 or 25%). When we vary the prior on the model size, we always obtain
the same conclusion ex post: …ve variables have higher posterior probabilities of inclusion than the
prior ones, and all other variables fail on this criterion. Most remarkably, it is always the same …ve
variables, namely log income, log infrastructure, government spending, real interest rate and relative
productivity. This suggests that a prior model size of 5 variables (as used in Table 3) deserves special
attention.
To summarize the main …ndings from Tables 3 and 4, we conclude that the list of robust correlates
of the real exchange rate is relatively short, and transport infrastructure belongs to that short list.
Moreover, the BMA procedure also reveals that the economic signi…cance of the infrastructure e¤ect is
approximately comparable to that of the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect. More precisely, a change in either
variable by one standard deviation has a similar e¤ect on the real exchange rate. Both appear to
be much stronger than the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect. Many other potential determinants suggested by the
literature such as terms of trade, trade barriers or net foreign asset position do not survive the scrutiny
of the BMA robustness checks.

3.3

Two-Stage Least Squares
One might be worried about potential missing regressors or measurement errors or the endogene-

ity of transport infrastructure generally. In theory, a common solution to these problems is to …nd
instrumental variables and perform a two-stage regression. In practice, it is hard to come up with
satisfying instruments.
Our idea is to use earthquake damages as possible instruments. Major earthquakes cause damages
to roads and bridges. If the damages are severe enough, the repair may not be completed within a
given calendar year. Of course, a given earthquake creates proportionally larger damages in a smaller
country. This suggests that some interactions between earthquakes and country size may be correlated
with a country’s stock of transport infrastructure.
In addition, intrinsic di¢ culties in building roads/railways in a country due to its natural terrain characteristics together with ‡uctuations in the global prices of construction material could also
a¤ect the pace at which a country builds transport infrastructure. So we consider some interactions
between a country’s terrain ruggedness and the global prices of construction material as a second set
of instrumental variables.
It is possible that earthquakes or terrain ruggedness a¤ect the real exchange rate directly without
going through the infrastructure channel. In that case, some of the proposed instruments would be
correlated with the error term in the main regression, invalidating the instruments. We will perform
a number of statistical checks for the validity of our instrumental variable idea. First, we will check
if, across countries and over time, interactions between earthquakes and country size, and interactions
between terrain ruggedness and the price of construction material a¤ect a country’s infrastructure in
a statistically signi…cant way. More precisely, we will perform a weak IV test to see if we can reject
the null that the proposed instruments are weak instruments. Second, we will check if the proposed
instruments are correlated with the error term in the main regression. The proposed instruments are
considered statistically valid if we reject the null of weak instruments but do not reject the null of a
zero correlation between the instruments and the error term in the main regression.
We measure severity of earthquakes in a country and year by the ratio of total number of people
a¤ected by earthquakes to the total population in that country and year.
Our second set of instrumental variables is based on the interactions between a country’s terrain
ruggedness and the prices of materials used in road construction. Our measure of ruggedness is a geometric mean of …ve di¤erent measures of terrain ruggedness. One such measure is Terrain Ruggedness
Index (TRI), originally devised by Riley, DeGloria and Elliot (1999) to quantify topographic heterogeneity in wildlife habitats providing concealment for preys and lookout posts. To calculate TRI, one
…rst computes "TRI (100m) at the central point," which is given by the sum of the squared di¤erences
in elevation between the central point and the eight adjacent points. With TRI (100m) for each point
on a grid, one then averages across all grid cells in the country not covered by water to obtain the
average terrain ruggedness of the country’s land area. The other four measures of terrain ruggedness
20

come from Nunn and Puga (2012): Population weighted TRI across regions, average slope, local standard deviation in elevation, and percentage of terrarain that are rated as moderately to highly rugged
(%).
We construct a time series measure of the weighted average of prices of main materials used in
road construction, consisting of sand and gravel, crushed stone, cement, and steel. The weights on
di¤erent material are based on "Materials in use in US interstate highways" published by US Geological
Survey.
Table 5 presents regressions of road density on the proposed instruments, together with separate
country and year …xed e¤ects. Unsurprisingly, earthquake damages are found to be associated with a
reduction in infrastructure. The e¤ect of greater ruggedness on road construction is more nuanced. On
the one hand, great ruggedness implies a greater di¢ culty in building roads; On the other hand, it may
also imply a greater need for roads. We will let the data decide how the interactions between ruggedness
and construction prices a¤ect road building. Each column in Table 5 represents a …rst-stage regression
that is used in conjunction with a second-stage regression reported in the corresponding column in
Table 6.
The second stage regressions of the two-stage procedure are reported in Table 6. Before we look
at the slope coe¢ cients, let us …rst look at the statistical tests for the validity of the instruments.
Based on the critical values reported in Stock, Wright, and Yogo (2002), we can reject the hypothesis
that the proposed instrument variables are weak instruments in eight out of nine cases. In other words,
the correlations between the proposed instruments and infrastructure are generally strong. We also
perform an over-identi…cation test (for the null hypothesis that the proposed instruments and the error
term are uncorrelated). From the p-values of the Sargan N*R-sq test, we cannot reject that null of no
correlation between the proposed instruments and the error term in the main regression at the 10%
level. In a statistical sense, the instruments are unlikely to a¤ect the RER directly without going
through transport infrastructure.
Interestingly, the Durbin-Wu-Hausman chi-squared test fails to reject the null that the OLS and
2SLS estimates are the same at the 10% level in all cases. In other words, in our application, transport
infrastructure appears exogenous, and in principle, no instrumental variables are needed.
In any case, from Table 6, with the instrumentation, log road density always has a negative and
statistically signi…cant coe¢ cient. To the extent the instruments are valid (or not needed based on
the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test), we conclude that an improvement in transport infrastructure typically
causes a depreciation of the country’s real exchange rate.

Extensions and Additional Robustness Checks
In this section, we consider various extensions and additional robustness checks.

21

3.4.1

Alternative measures of the real exchange rate and transport infrastructure

In addition to the real e¤ective exchange rate (REER) computed by the IMF, we have constructed
a bilateral real exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar (BRER). We summarize the results from the
Bayesian Model Averaging exercise on this alternative dependent variable in Table 7. As we can see
clearly, all the qualitative results are the same as when REER is used. In particular, four variables are
found to be robust determinants of the BRER, and transport infrastructure is one of them. Recall that
the same four variables were also robust when the real exchange rate is measured by REER. Other
variables are found to be not robust. In particular, trade openness and net foreign asset position as a
share of GDP are not robust determinants of the RER. It is interesting that relative productivity is
not robustly signi…cant when BRER rather than REER is used to measure the real exchange rate.
Because the scale of the BRER is not the same as the REER, the point estimates (the conditional
means in Table 7) are di¤erent from their counterparts in Table 3. Nonetheless, the relative size of
the coe¢ cients is similar. In particular, the income e¤ect and the transport infrastructure e¤ect are
broadly similar. Both are much greater than the e¤ects of government spending share and real interest
rate.
As an alternative to measuring infrastructure by road density, we also use the ratio of total goods
volume transported to area size. There are two advantages associated with the alternative measure.
First, it automatically takes into account potentially di¤erent transportation capacities of di¤erent
roads. Second, it includes transportation by air or water. The disadvantage is that this variable is
only available for a much smaller set of countries (22 now versus 46 before). In any case, this is a
check on the robustness of the basic results. Our regression results, reported in Table 8, suggest that
transport infrastructure measured in this way also has a negative and statistically signi…cant e¤ect on
the RER.

3.4.2

Di¤erent sub-samples

We now consider di¤erent subsamples. Some of the countries are small economies or otherwise
island economies. To ensure that our results are not dominated by such economies, we consider
a sub-sample of countries that exclude small economies (those with a population of 1.5 million or
less) and island economies. The BMA results (the posterior inclusion probability and the conditional
mean of the coe¢ cients) for the modi…ed sample are reported in the …rst two columns of Table 9.
The conclusions on the posterior inclusion probabilities are virtually identical to the earlier results.
Transport infrastructure is one of the robust determinants of the RER, and its economic e¤ect is nearly
comparable to that of the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect.
Major oil exporters tend to run a persistent current account surplus, and may be di¤erent from
other countries in other ways too. In the middle two columns of Table 9, we report the analysis on a
subsample that excludes major oil exporters. Again, the results are virtually the same as before.

22

Since the IMF (2006) …nds that transition economies (i.e., former centrally planned economies)
appear to have a di¤erent RER behavior, we conduct a robustness check by excluding these countries
from the sample and report the results in Columns 5-6 of Table 9. We …nd again that log income, log
infrastructure, government spending share, real interest rate, relative productivity, and this time, net
foreign asset position are robust determinants of the RER.
We can also identify potential outliers in a statistical (mechanical) way. We consider all countryyears whose residuals from the regression in Column 4 of Table 2 are more than three standard
deviations away from the mean (zero) as outliers. The BMA analysis on a sample that excludes these
outliers are reported in the last two columns of Table 9. The results are again very similar to those in
Table 3.
We can also slice the sample by country income level. We report the BMA results (still the
posterior probability of inclusion and the conditional means of the coe¢ cients) for the high-income
sample in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 10, and those for developing countries in Columns 3 and 4 of Table
10. Income, infrastructure, real interest rate and government spending share are robustly signi…cant in
both cases (in the sense that the posterior inclusion probability is greater than the prior probability).
None of the other variables is robustly signi…cant for both samples.
Finally, we can cut the sample into two time periods: 1988-1997, and 1998-2007. The results for
them are reported in Columns 5-6 and 7-8 of Table 10, respectively. In both sub-samples, income,
infrastructure, government spending share, and real interest rate have posterior inclusion probabilities
that are greater than the prior probabilities. It is interesting that the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect appears more
important in the earlier sample than the later one. None of the other variables is robustly signi…cant
in both periods.

3.4.3

Evidence from across regions within a single country

We can go beyond cross-country regressions and check if the relationship between the real exchange
rate and transport infrastructure is also replicated across regions within a country. This is a useful
check since many country-level legal institutions, regulations, cultural factors, and nominal exchange
rate ‡uctuations are automatically held constant in that setting, hence further alleviating concerns
about missing regressors.
We do a case study on China because it is spatially large with regional variations in the infrastructure build-up. We use Beijing as the benchmark region and construct local real exchange rates for all
provinces (and province-level super cities) against Beijing from 2001-2010. A region’s real exchange
rate in a given year is the value of the local CPI relative to the value of CPI in Beijing in the same
year.
We have more information about road quality in China than in the cross-country data set. In
particular, we know not only whether a road is paved or not, but also a capacity grade (maximum

23

vehicle circulation volume) based on the width of a road and the construction material (The Technical
Standard of Highway Engineering of China JGTB01-2003). The o¢ cial capacity grades take on six
discrete values, Express, Classes I, II, III, IV and Below Class roads, with Express for the highest
capacity and Below Class for the lowest capacity. By using the median capacity numbers for a given
class as speci…ed in the technical standard, we convert every kilometer of Class I, II, III, IV and Below
Class roads into equivalent kilometers of express paved roads. Using the assumption that railways are
equivalent to express paved roads, our …nal road density is measured by the sum of the railways and
equivalent express paved roads divided by a region’s area size.8 The subsequent results will be based
on this measure. However, we have also adopted a simple measure of road density without quality
adjustment (i.e., simple sum of the paved roads, regardless of quality class, and the railroads). The
main inferences are qualitatively similar. The summary statistics for the key variables are presented
in Table 11.
In the …rst three columns of Table 12, we report a set of panel regression results. We again
normalize all regressors by their respective standard deviations so that the coe¢ cients on the regressors
can be more easily compared.
In the …rst column of Table 12, we regress regional real exchange rate on regional road density,
together with separate regional and year …xed e¤ects, and obtain a negative coe¢ cient on road density.
This means that the local RER tends to be lower in regions and years in which there is a faster-thanaverage improvement in road density. In the second column, we add log income and government
spending share; in the third column, we also add indicators for local product and factor market
development, respectively. We observe that the local RER is always negatively related to local road
density. Both log income and the share of government expenditure in local GDP have a positive
sign, consistent with the Balassa-Samuelson and Froot-Rogo¤ hypotheses, respectively. In this withincountry sample, judging from the point estimates, the infrastructure e¤ect appears stronger than either
the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect or the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect.
To address concerns that the transport infrastructure may be mis-measured (or otherwise endogenous), we instrument it by some interactions between severity of earthquakes and region size (and
its higher order polynomial terms in one-period lags), measured in a similar way to the cross-country
sample. The last three columns of Table 12 report the second stage regressions of the 2SLS procedure.
As we can see, transport infrastructure continues to have a negative coe¢ cient. The coe¢ cients on
log infrastructure are signi…cant in Columns 4 and 5, but in Column 6, infrastructure loses statistical
signi…cance. At the bottom of the table, we report tests (Sargan test) on whether the IVs are correlated with the error term in the main regressions. The results suggest that we cannot reject the null
of zero correlation. The Stock-Yogo test suggests that we can reject the null that the instruments are
weak. Hence, in a mechanical sense, we can say that the interaction between severity of earthquakes
8 There are three di¤erent types of the quality adjusted ratio between rail, Express, Class I, II, III, IV, and Below Class in Technical Standard of Highway Engineering of China (JGTB01-2003). The median standard is set at
1:1:0.56:0.16:0.064:0.0192:0.00576; low standard (LS) is set at 1:1:0.6:0.2:0.08:0.016:0.0032; high standard is set at
1:1:0.55:0.15:0.06:0.02:0.0067.

24

and region sizes (and its polynomial term) are reasonable instruments for this sample as well. Interestingly, the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test indicates that we cannot reject the null that the OLS and 2SLS
coe¢ cients are the same. We can read it as suggesting that endogeneity is not a major problem in this
context, and the OLS estimates are reasonable. In other words, the OLS results reported in the …rst
three columns of Table 12 are statistically valid.
We also perform robustness checks by the BMA procedure and report the results in Tables 13 and
14. All in all, the within-country evidence is consistent with the notion that transport infrastructure
is a robust determinant of the real exchange rate, and that its economic signi…cance is no less than
the Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect or the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect.

3.4.4

Evidence on the competition channel: Transport infrastructure and markups

A key mechanism in our story is that improved transport infrastructure leads to more competition (…rms selling in the local market have to compete more with …rms from outside the region).
The increased competition in turn leads to a lower markup by locally-selling …rms, contributing to a
reduction in the overall price level. In this subsection, we employ …rm-level …nancial data to shed light
on this mechanism.
We have annual balance sheet level data for Chinese industrial …rms during 2000-2007 from an
annual survey of …rms by the National Bureau of Statistics. The data set is meant to cover all nonstate …rms with annual sales reaching or exceeding 5 million RMBs (about $625,000) plus all majority
state-owned …rms. Because we do not observe product-level markups directly, we look at three proxies.
The …rst is return on assets (ROA), de…ned as net income scaled by the book value of total assets. The
second is return on equity (ROE), de…ned as net income scaled by the total value of common equity.
Finally, we look at pro…t rate, de…ned as the ratio of net pro…t to total revenue. We take advantage
of the information on the location of the …rms (most …rms operate in one region) and relate changes
in pro…tability to changes in local transport infrastructure.
As for any survey data, our …rm-level data could be noisy and prone to have outliers. We clean
the data by excluding …rms whose reported annual growth rate of revenue is either greater than 100%
or smaller than -100%, whose reported ownership across owners exceeds 100%, whose employment is
negative, or whose ratio of long-term debt to asset is larger than 10 or negative. Because we have
many data points, we do not need to worry about lack of statistical power and therefore choose to be
relatively aggressive in the …ltering process in order to minimize the in‡uence of outliers.
We run variations of the following regression:

(3.1)

where the left-hand-side variable is ROA, ROE or Pro…t Margin for …rm i in industry j and province
k in year t; log Inf rastructurek;t =log road density for province k in year t. In the basic regression,
we use quality weighted road density. In robustness checks, we also use unweighted road density,
which turns out to produce similar results. log Inf rastructurek;t Export_dmyi;t =interaction of local
infrastructure and export status of …rm i in province k in year t. (The interaction term is to allow for
a secondary feature of the model that …rms that sell outside the region may not reduce their markups
by as much as those that sell only locally. Ideally, we would like to distinguish among …rms that sell
only within a region, those that sell domestically but across regions, and those that also sell in the
world market. Due to data constraints, we can only distinguish between …rms that sell domestically
and those that also export to the world market.)
Xi;t is a set of …rm characteristics including …rm size (measured by log employment), leverage
ratio, investment intensity, and revenue growth; Zk;t is a set of provincial characteristics including
log GDP per capita, log consumption per capita, government expenditure/GDP, an index for product
market development, and an index for factor market development.
We include …rm …xed e¤ects to absorb the impact of time-invariant sector and …rm characteristics
including potential sector speci…c tax treatments and managerial abilities. Importantly, we also include
industry year …xed e¤ects, which are more general than either year …xed e¤ects or industry …xed
e¤ects. They can absorb the impact of economy-wide factors such as in‡ation. They also absorb
the impact of sector-level (and potentially time-varying factors) supply and demand factors such as
worldwide price changes. We cluster standard errors at the province year level (the same level at
which transport infrastructure is measured).
The regression results are reported in Table 15 . The dependent variable is log ROE in the …rst
two columns, log ROA in the middle two columns, and pro…t margin in the last two columns. In all six
regressions, the coe¢ cient on log road density is negative; in …ve out of six cases, the coe¢ cient is also
statistically signi…cant at the …ve percent level. These patterns are consistent with the interpretation
that better transport infrastructure tends to increase competition and reduce markups and pro…tability.
Overall, the …rm-level evidence suggests that better infrastructure promotes competition, leading …rms
to cut their markups.
In Appendix Table F5, we have also examined whether better transport infrastructure is associated
with a lower price of intermediate inputs, and found supportive evidence for this. Consistent with our
theoretical discussion, even if one holds the markup constant, lower input costs also give …rms an
opportunity to charge a lower price for their output. This is another channel for better infrastructure
to produce a lower RER.

Conclusions
In this paper, we show that transport infrastructure is an important determinant of the real

exchange rate. The Bayesian Model Averaging procedure suggests that the list of robust determinants
is not long, but transport infrastructure belongs to the list. Moreover, the economic importance of the
infrastructure e¤ect is almost on par with the well-known Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect, and much greater
than the Froot-Rogo¤ e¤ect. Many other potential determinants proposed in the literature such as net
foreign asset position, terms of trade, and barriers to international trade do not appear to be robust.
The results have interesting policy implications. If one employs a model to assess equilibrium
exchange rate that does not include transport infrastructure (think of the current IMF approach to
assessing the exchange rate), one may mistakenly conclude that countries with a faster-than-average
improvement in transport infrastructure have an undervalued real exchange rate. In addition, for countries that have an external competitiveness problem but are stuck in a currency union, improvement
in domestic transport infrastructure (to the extent there is scope to do so) is another way to reduce
real exchange rates and improve competitiveness.
Because the real exchange rate is such an important relative price, and exchange rate assessment is
such an important task for the international …nancial system, more scrutiny of existing determinants
and more searches for new ones are both bene…cial. We hope this paper will stimulate additional
research on the topic.

(1) indicates posterior inclusion probability is larger than prior inclusion probability.
(2) The left-hand-side variable in all regressions is the log Real Effective Exchange Rate. The sample is the same as the ones
included in Column 4 of Table 2 and sample period is 1988-2007. Country and year means of all variables are purged before
the BMA procedure is applied.
(3) All regressors are ranked by the first column, the posterior inclusion probability (PIP). This is the sum of the posterior
probabilities of all models containing the variable. The next two columns are the posterior mean and standard deviations for
the linear marginal effect of the variable. The conditional mean and standard deviation of a variable are conditional on its
inclusion in the model. “Positive Sign Certainty" is the posterior probability that the coefficient is positive conditional on
inclusion; it is a measure of posterior confidence on the sign of the coefficient. Similar definition is used for “negative sign
certainty”.
(4) We use ‘Empirical Bayes g’, as advocated by George and Foster (2000) and Hansen and Yu (2001), and a Binomial Model
Prior as suggested by Sala-I-Martin et al. (2004). The prior model size is set to be 5 in this table; the next table verifies that this
is a reasonable prior.

(2) To be consistent, the orders of variables are kept the same as that of Table3.
(3) “Small economies” follow the definition of the World Bank as those with less than 1.5 million people. A list of Island
Countries can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_island_countries.
(4) “Major oil exporters” are OPEC members.
(5) A list of transition economies refers to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_economy#cite_note-imf2000-5.
(6) Outliers in the last column are defined as observations whose residuals from regression 4 in Table 2 are greater than 3 times

(1) PIP = Posterior Inclusion Probability. indicates PIP is larger than prior inclusion probability (or 62.5% in this case).
(2) To be consistent, the orders of variables are kept the same as that of Table3.
(3) “High income economies” follow the definition of the World Bank; all others are in the “Developing Countries” group.

Data Source: Macroeconomic variables come from the National Bureau of Statistics of China; infrastructure and goods transported
statistics come from Yearbook of Transportation & Communications of the People’s Republic of China. The Product market
development index measures the degree to which product prices are market determined and the degree of local trade protectionism.
The factor market development index is meant to capture local financial market development, openness to foreign investment, labor
mobility, and technological achievements. Both are constructed by Fan Gang et al. (2011) based partly from a survey of firms. The
source of data on earthquake damages is the Emergency Disaster Data Base managed by the Center for Research on the
Epidemiology of Disasters at Université Catholique de Louvain - Ecole de Santé Publique in Brussels.

Data Source: World Development Indicator, International Transport Form, Ministry of Railway and Ministry of Transport of China
Notes:
(1) Income per capita is defined as GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2005 International $).
(2) Paved roads of China are defined as the sum of Expressway and Class I- IV Highway because of data availability for China.
(3) Total Goods Transported are normalizing 1990=100 for China and 2003=100 for India due to data availability.

Figure 3: Conditional Scatter Plots of log REER on log infrastructure (1988-2007)

Notes:
(1) The left graph presents the raw scatter plot of log REER against log infrastructure, conditional on all other regressors in
Column 4 of Table 2.
(2) The right graph is a noise-filtered version of the left graph. Specifically, we divide the scatter points in the left graph into 50
equal-width bins based on the values on the x axis. Within each box, we compute the mean value of log REER. The resulting
mean REER is plotted against the mid-value of infrastructure for all boxes in the right graph.

C

Endogenous wages (for online publication only)
In the benchmark model, we do not consider a possible endogenous wage response to a change

in domestic trade costs (although in the empirical analysis we control for income di¤erences across
countries). In this extension, we show that, with endogenous wages in the two countries, we still
obtain the same qualitative results under some reasonable assumptions. In other words, the greater
competition e¤ect triggered by a decline in the trade cost is economically large enough to dominate
other possible e¤ects (through a change in wages) that might in‡uence the real exchange rate.
To allow for endogenous wages, we modify slightly the utility function as follows
U =w

Z

pci qic di +

i2

where w is the wage rate and

Z

qic di

i2

R

(qic ) di

Z

qic di

pci qic di is the expenditure on di¤erentiated goods. Given this utility

function, all equations on the demand side in the benchmark hold.

We continue to assume that

everyone supplies one unit of labor inelastically.
Now we assume that …rms will produce di¤erentiated goods using labor with marginal cost cw,
where c represents the e¢ ciency of a …rm’s production. We assume that c is a random variable drawn
from the same distribution as in the benchmark. In this case, similar to the benchmark model, we can

34

show that the optimal prices, quantities, and pro…ts for a representative …rm in Home region k are

We assume that entry barrier is no longer a constant and di¤ers across regions. For regions with
a higher wage rate, the entry cost is larger. For simplicity, we assume that the entry cost for a …rm in
region h is fE wh . We can show that the entry condition for …rms in Home region k now becomes

The worker-to-…rm ratio is a common constant across regions. Then by (C.3), all Home regions have
a symmetric labor market clearing condition. Hence, the wage is constant across Home regions. The
same result also holds for Foreign. Let wH and wF denote the Home wage rate and Foreign wage rate,
respectively. By (C.3) and (C.4), we can show that

In general, the e¤ect on Home CPI from a decline in

is ambiguous.

(C.7)

The international wage parity is a special result based on the assumption that the entry cost (i) is
proportional to the local wage, and (ii) the proportionality is identical across all regions. However, the
underlying intuition for the RER e¤ect is more general even when we relax those assumptions. As the
internal trade cost falls, …rms in region h face better opportunities to sell their products in other Home
regions and abroad, and they may raise their outputs. This will produce two e¤ects: (i) they lead
to greater competition which lowers the local CPI, and (ii) they raise labor demand, hence resulting
in a higher local wage rate. However, there is an o¤setting force that puts a downward pressure on
the local wage that comes from more …rms from other Home regions entering the local market and
crowding out some local …rms.
At the same time, a reduction in the within-Home trade cost can also produce two opposite
impacts on Foreign wage rate: i) a downward pressure from the fact that more Home …rms export to
Foreign markets which crowds out some Foreign …rms, and ii) Foreign …rms also …nd easier to export
to Home, which raises the labor demand and hence wage rate. In this model, the net e¤ects on the
wage rates in the two countries are the same. Then, the increased competition e¤ect on the price level
in Home leads to a decline in Home’s real exchange rate.
P
Now consider a special case in which Home is small ( in the sense that N and h Lh are much
P
smaller than N and f Lf ). By (C.3), we can show that, in any Home region h, wh is proportional
to the term
zero,

dcfD
d 1

m+2

. As in the previous analysis, we can easily show that, if N=N approaches

is close to zero. Notice that, if Home is small,

2

is not sensititve to the change in

1,

which

implies that wages in Home wh will not change much as the Home internal trading cost declines. A
summary of all the results when Home is small is as follows. An improvement in Home’s infrastructure
i) does not change cfD much; ii) does not change wh and wf much (since we have shown wh = wf );
however, iii) it lower chD . As a result, Home CPI (which an increasing function of chD wh ) will fall and
Home’s RER declines.

D

Innovation (for online publication only)
In this section, we investigate how a decline in the trade cost will in‡uence …rms’ innovation

behaviors. As in Song et al. (2011), we assume that each …rm hires a manager and delegates decision
authority to the manager. Managers may adopt an innovation which can improve productivities with
a positive possibility , which is an endogenous variable that can be optimally chosen by managers.
Suppose managers and …rms do not know the true productivity when making innovation decisions.
Managers choose the probability of success in innovation

by paying a cost g ( ), (g 0 > 0 and g 00 > 0).

After making an innovation decision, …rms get a productivity draw as in our benchmark model. If the
innovation succeeds, for a …rm with marginal cost c from the original productivity draw, it can now
produce the output with a new marginal cost c ( < 1). If the innovation fails, the …rm’s marginal
cost remains the same from the original productivity draw c. After the realization of output, managers

42

get paid. For those …rms who cannot survive, they …re their managers without paying any salaries.
The timeline for …rms and managers’decisions is shown in Appendix Figure D1.
Since …rms from the same region are ex ante the same, they will provide the same contract to
managers. Managers from the same region are also ex ante the same, they make the same innovation
decisions.
We assume the similar assumption as in Song et al (2011) that, managers can steal

output. For a representative …rm i from Home region k, the incentive constraint implies that

adjustment channel we have discussed in the benchmark, there is another e¤ect from a decline in the
within-Home trade cost on the Home CPI. As the within-Home trade cost falls, Home …rms are facing
increasing competition in each region. Managers hired by Home …rms are facing a greater possibility of
being …red. To avoid this situation, managers will choose a greater e¤ort in innovations which boosts
…rms’productivities and reduces the cost of production. As a result, prices will fall.

Traded input (for online publication only)
In this section, we consider another channel where an improvement in infrastructure can a¤ect the

real exchange rate. For simplicity, we consider a small open economy model. There are N regions within
the country. For a representative consumer from region i, she/he consumes a …nal good ci to obtain
utility, where ci consists of three types of goods: internationally tradable good (cIT ), domestically
tradable but internationally nontradable good (cDT ) and domestically nontradable good (cN T )

Assume that all markets are perfectly competitive, and we normalize the price for internationally

The relative productivity is Log (labor productivity in tradable sector)-Log (labor productivity in non-tradable sector). The labor
productivity is defined as volume of constant value added (US dollars)/ Number of persons engaged (total employment). The tradable
sector consists of Agriculture and Industry, while the non-tradable sector refers to services. The construction follows Gian Maria
Milesi-Ferretti (2006) and MacDonald and Ricci (2001).

Labor market statistics cover the economically active civilian population, and are from the Yearbook of Labour Statistics by the
International Labor Organization (ILO) and its online database, http://laborsta.ilo.org. The concept of employment conforms to the
recommendations adopted by the ILO: Thirteenth International Conference of Labor Statisticians, Geneva, 1992.

Our Ruggedness Index is a geometric mean of five different ruggedness indexes: Terrain Ruggedness Index (100m) originally
devised by Riley et al. (1999), and four other measures, Population weighted TRI (100m), Average slope (%), Local std. deviation in
elevation (100 m), and moderately to highly rugged (%) provided by Nunn and Puga (2012). For details of the individual indices, see
http://diegopuga.org/data/rugged/.

The weights on different material come from ‘Materials in Use in U.S. Interstate Highways’, available from:
http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2006/3127/2006-3127.pdf. We skip asphalt price because it only start from 1990 in the US Geological Survey data.

Prices of hot rolled steel and steel wire rod are used, without considering cold steel since it is not usually used in roads building.
