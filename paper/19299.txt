The Disintermediation of Financial Markets: Direct Investing in Private Equity
Lily Fang, Victoria Ivashina, and Josh Lerner
NBER Working Paper No. 19299
August 2013
JEL No. G0,G23
ABSTRACT
One of the important issues in corporate finance is the rationale for and role of financial intermediaries.
In the private equity setting, institutional investors are increasingly eschewing intermediaries in favor
of direct investments. To understand the trade-offs in this setting, we compile a proprietary dataset
of direct investments from seven large institutional investors. We find that solo investments by institutions
outperform co-investments and a wide range of benchmarks for traditional private equity partnership
investments. The outperformance is driven by deals where informational problems are not too severe,
such as more proximate transactions to the investor and later-stage deals, and by an ability to avoid
the deleterious effects on returns often seen in periods with large inflows into the private equity market.
The poor performance of co-investments, on the other hand, appears to result from fund managers’
selective offering of large deals to institutions for co-investing.

1. Introduction
One of the enduring interests in the corporate finance literature has related to the ubiquity
of intermediaries in financial markets. In the benchmark Arrow-Debreu world of complete
information and perfect markets, there is no need for financial intermediaries: individuals and
firms can transact seamlessly with each other. But as these strict assumptions are relaxed, an
explicit role for financial intermediaries emerges.
The widely offered explanations for the frequent appearance of intermediaries in
financial markets are two-fold. 1 The first involves transaction costs. Many authors, beginning
with Gurley and Shaw (1960), have highlighted the presence of frictions which can impose a
substantial drag on the returns of investors operating independently. By pooling capital across
multiple individuals and institutions, the costs associated with assessing and undertaking
investments can be shared, thereby enhancing investors’ returns.
The second explanation highlighted in the literature builds on information advantages of
financial intermediaries. The possibility that an intermediary may have superior information to
that of investors has motivated many models. To cite two classic models, Leland and Pyle (1977)
argue that intermediaries invest in assets where they have special knowledge, while Diamond
(1984) suggests that these financial actors serve as “delegated monitors.” The majority of the
information-driven models of financial intermediation have focused on the banks. But Chan
(1982) and Admati and Pfleiderer (1994) highlight how informational advantages may motivate
investors to deploy equity capital through private equity funds.
To be sure, these explanations are not exhaustive. Among the alternative rationales
developed in the literature are the ability of intermediaries to shift risk across parties and time
1

This discussion is drawn from several review articles, including Allen (2001), Allen and
Santomero (1998), and Gorton and Winton (2003).

(Merton, 1987), their provision of liquidity to investors whom might have to otherwise
inefficiently terminate investments (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983), their role as a bridge between
investors with differing beliefs (Coval and Thakor, 2005), and their ability to offer compensation
schemes that institutional investors are constrained from offering (Gennaioli, et al., 2012).
At the same time, intermediaries are far from a panacea. A voluminous literature on the
behavior of banks during the run-up to the financial crisis has highlighted how agency problems
led them to neglect the interests of their capital providers. Mutual funds and insurance companies
have been shown to engage in behaviors that benefit portfolio managers at the expense of their
investors (e.g., Chevalier and Ellison, 1997; Becker and Ivashina, 2012). On the private equity
side, investors have been shown to grow fees at the expense of returns (Kaplan and Schoar,
2005; Lopez-de-Silanes, et al., 2011), invest aggressively at market peaks when expected returns
are modest (Axelson, et al., 2012), and exit transactions prematurely to facilitate fundraising
(Gompers, 1996). Moreover, many classes of institutional investors appear to sub-optimally
choose which private equity groups to invest with (Lerner, et al., 2007; Hochberg and Rauh,
2011).
It is against this theoretical backdrop that the recent interest among institutional investors
in investing directly in private equity is particularly noteworthy. Private equity might appear to
be a textbook case where the benefits from financial intermediation—in this case, specialized
funds—would be substantial: not only are the transaction costs associated with structuring these
investments large (for example, see Kaplan and Strömberg, 2003, 2004), but substantial
information asymmetries surround the selection, monitoring, and nurturing of the investments,
giving rise to potential information advantages for specialized investors. And yet the interest on
the part of institutional investors in undertaking direct investments—and thus bypassing

2

intermediaries—appears to have increased substantially, as numerous news stories (as well as
surveys by Coller Capital and Preqin) document. 2
In this paper, we seek to understand the relative tradeoffs between direct and
intermediated investing in private equity. By understanding these issues in this rich context, we
aim to enhance our understanding of financial intermediaries more generally. Toward this end,
we compile a proprietary dataset of direct investments from seven large institutional investors.
For these investors we have complete coverage of their direct investments programs, including
solo investments and co-investments. Our dataset consists of detailed cash flows for 392 direct
investments made by these institutions between 1991 and 2011. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first large-sample study that takes a close look at direct investments in private equity
made by institutional investors.
We examine the investing patterns—e.g., timing and geography—as well as the
performance of these direct investments. When studying the investment performance, we
compare the performance of these investments against the major benchmarks for private equity.
We use three metrics of investment performance: 1) returns net of the fees and carried interest
paid to general partners; 2) returns net of fees, carry, and the added expenses borne by the
limited partners (e.g., internal staff costs); and 3) the market-adjusted returns net of fees and
carry.
The key findings of our analysis are as follows:

•

Direct investments are cyclical. As with private equity funds (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005),
the most direct funds are invested at times when ex post performance is relatively poor.
As a result, aggregate performance is better when we undertake a simple average of
annual performance than when years are weighted by the amount of capital invested in
that year.

•

Direct investments generally outperform fund investments. But the strongest finding is
that within direct investments, solo transactions, i.e., investments initiated and executed
by investors alone, significantly outperform co-investments, which are deals done
alongside private equity funds. These results are robust to the use of various benchmarks
and lag structures, and provide an economic rationale for the disintermediation trend in
private equity investing.

•

The impact of years with extensive private equity inflows is less deleterious to the returns
of solo investments. While returns are lower, solo investments in peak years significantly
outperform co-investments and partnership investments. Nonetheless, the volume of
direct investments appears to fall after market peaks.

•

The advantages of solo deals over co-investments are greater in setting where information
problems are less intense, such as local and later-stage firms that perform less R&D.

•

The underperformance of the co-investments appears to be driven by selection (“lemons
problem”): institutional investors can only co-invest in deals that are available to them.
Opportunities for co-investment are likely to be selected based on deal size. We find that
co-investments deals are substantially larger than an average sponsor’s deal. We also find
evidence consistent with co-investments being exited later than other investments led by
the same private equity fund.

4

As our sample is limited and self-reported, a discussion of the selection bias is in order.
We assess the potential selection bias in detail in the Data Section below. But we should point
out that, within our sample, there is no selection bias; we have the full list of direct
investments—solo and co-investments—for the institutions in our sample. This makes the
difference between co-investments and solo direct investments a particularly strong result. 3
Our results illustrate the theoretical literature summarized above in several ways. First,
the findings highlight the power of intermediation. While the net returns between direct and
partnership investments are similar, because the partnerships charge higher fees, the
intermediated investments’ gross returns are larger. (We leave the question of whether the fees
charged by private equity funds for their services are appropriate outside the scope of this paper.)
Second, the analyses highlight the power of intermediation in information-rich environments.
The performance of the non-intermediated deals deteriorates sharply in settings where
information problems make either deal selection or monitoring more difficult, consistent with the
depictions by Leland and Pyle (1977) and Diamond (1984). Finally, the results hint at a complex
set of agency problems between intermediaries and the ultimate investors that are not fully
captured by most models of financial intermediation: for instance, the tendency of coinvestments undertaken by these groups to cluster in the most overheated markets and largest
deals.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the economics of
direct investing. In Section 3, we present the data set that was assembled for this study. Sections
4 and 5 evaluate the performance differentials between the direct investment sample and several
benchmarks. Section 6 concludes the paper.
3

Anecdotally, insiders in some institutional funds have shared with us that their experiences with
solo and co-investments are consistent with our evidence.

2. The economics of direct investments
Traditionally, institutional investors make private equity investments by committing
capital to private equity funds. The funds are managed by professional investors (e.g., the
Blackstone Group), known as the general partners (GPs). The institutional investors (e.g., South
Carolina’s pension fund) are known as limited partners (LPs). The general partners are in charge
of the entire investing process, from deal selection, execution, monitoring to exiting. The limited
partners play a passive role as capital provider. In fact, in many nations, they need to remain
passive in order to maintain the limited liability status.
In recent years, there has been an increasing trend for institutional investors to make
direct investments, bypassing the GPs as intermediaries. These deals include transactions in
which an institutional investor co-invests in a deal that is originated by a general partner (i.e., a
PE fund manager) and ones in which the institutional investor originates and invests in alone. In
addition, there are hybrid cases where an institution co-leads a deal with a general partner or
another institutional investor. Figure 1 depicts different variants of direct investment
arrangements. In this paper, we refer to these various types of investments collectively as “direct
investments”. We use “solo investments” to refer to those deals originated and completed by the
LPs on their own, and “co-investments” to refer to deals where LPs invest alongside GPs. The
key feature of the latter arrangements (relative to investments by partnerships) is that the LP
plays an active role in deciding whether to make the co-investment and typically pays the GPs
reduced fees and carried interest, if any.
[FIGURE 1]

6

Why are LPs increasingly interested in making investments directly? One clear
motivation is the high cost of investing in private equity funds. In the traditional LP-GP setting,
GPs are compensated through a management fee (typically 1.5 to 2% of committed capital or
assets under management) and a “carried interest,” a percentage (typically 20%) of the fund’s
investment profits. This “2-and-20” compensation structure implies a cumulative investment cost
of 5 to 7 percentage points per year under a wide range of performance assumptions, a large
economic magnitude.
In the years after the private equity boom of 2005 to 2007, the high levels of
compensation that private equity fund managers enjoy (Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Metrick and
Yasuda, 2010) attracted increasing attention. A growing body of evidence suggests that many
private equity LPs do not outperform public market benchmarks (e.g., Kaplan and Schoar
(2005), Gottschalg and Phalippou (2009)). While the aggregate performance of private equity
over public markets is a subject of debate recently—for differing approaches and conclusions,
see for instance Gottschalg and Phalippou (2009), Harris, et al. (2012) and Axelson, et al.
(2013)—it is clear that even if private equity outperforms public equity, not all LPs benefit from
this outperformance: many of the best returns appear concentrated among funds selected by
endowments and foundations, rather than those that dominate the portfolios of banks, insurance
companies, and pension funds (Lerner, et al., 2007).
Fees in direct deals are different from the “2-and-20” compensation structure. In direct
deals originated by LPs themselves (solo investments), there are typically no fees paid. In the
case of co-investments, any fees and carry are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis. LPs typically
resent paying additional charges for transactions originated by fund managers with whom they
have invested (see Hoye and Lerner (1996) for an illustrative case). In general, large institutions

7

(which dominate our sample) have a great deal of market power, and are unlikely to be charged
such fees by their GPs. The significant savings on fees and carry in direct investments imply that
all else being equal, direct investors should enjoy better net returns.
While cost savings are important, our conversations with institutional investors have
suggested that it is not the sole—or, in some cases, even the primary—motivation behind the
movement towards direct investing. In the traditional LP-GP setting, GPs are in charge of deal
selection as well as the timing of investments, leaving LPs with little control and flexibility.
Direct investments give LPs more control. Investors we interviewed point out that the ability to
selectively invest in (“cherry pick”) deals where the investment opportunities are particularly
attractive and where managers can apply sector expertise and active management skills to add
value is an important reason for solo investing or co-investing. According to our interviews,
some of the institutions pick less than 5% of deals available to them.
In addition, direct investments might give investors a better ability to time the market.
This is valuable because private equity funds’ performance is highly cyclical (Axelson, et al.,
2012; Kaplan and Schoar, 2005). According to the theories on delegated investing, a principalagency problem may arise in the traditional LP-GP setting. (See, for example, Shleifer and
Vishny (1993), which discusses the agency problems in delegated investing; Chevalier and
Ellison (1999) and Hong, et al. (2000) provide empirical evidence.) GPs’ reputational and career
concerns may lead them to “herd” and invest heavily at the peak of the private equity market,
when inflows into private equity funds are high, credit is cheap, and all other GPs are heavily
investing. This cyclical investing behavior may lead to suboptimal performance, as the
investments in peak periods are often entered into at high valuations (Gompers and Lerner, 2000;
Axelson, et al., 2012). By investing directly, LPs may circumvent the agency problem in

8

investing. In particular, LPs may not feel as pressured as GPs do to undertake deals at the peak of
the market, and may be better able to invest in “cold” markets when few are investing. Such
contrarian investing may lead to superior performance. In our interviews, some of the asset
managers had indicated to us that they had suspended their investments relatively early in 2007
and did not start to invest again until 2010.
Direct investments also give the LPs a better ability to customize their risk exposures.
Because investors can invest selectively, direct investments offer a much sharper tool to manage
targeted risk profiles than fund commitments, where the timing and amount of investments—and
hence the risk exposures—are controlled by the private equity fund.
Finally, co-investing may also better align the interests between the LPs and GPs to
achieve higher investment quality. GPs can be distracted—for example, by underperforming
portfolio companies or plans for some portfolio companies to go public—and thus not be wholly
focused on investing during potentially attractive times to deploy capital. In co-investments,
because the LPs play a more active role and work closely with the GP, such a principal-agent
problem between the GPs and LPs may be reduced.
Direct investments, however, have downsides as well. The biggest challenge is
investment skill. In the traditional fund investing, the LPs’ main task is to select the right
managers. Thus, traditionally LPs’ skills should relate to manager selection. But to invest more
directly, the LPs need to step into GP-like roles, needing deal-level due diligence, operational,
and monitoring capabilities that are not in their traditional skillset. To the extent that the LPs’
internal staff is less skilled and/or experienced in transaction-related activities than the GPs,
direct investments may on average be of worse quality than portfolio companies in funds.

9

These concerns might be particularly true for co-investments. In these instances, the LP is
typically offered the investment opportunity with only a limited amount of time to undertake due
diligence. It might also be the case that in these instances, the greater information of the private
equity group relative to that of the LP creates a “lemons problem”—i.e., GPs offer LPs
investments in below-average quality deals—which would translate into lower returns.
Reinforcing this type of equilibrium is the fact that the staff of the LPs typically receives
lower compensation than investment professionals in funds, reflecting the frequent association of
institutional investors with the government or non-profit bodies. Therefore, even if the LPs have
talented internal staff to make direct investments, ultimately these promising investors are likely
to move to traditional partnerships. If the labor market for investment skills is reasonably
efficient, one would expect that direct investments might on average be of worse quality than the
portfolio companies chosen by funds. Not only might this lower investment quality offset the
gains from reduced fees and carry, it may also negate the other rationales cited by LPs for direct
investing, such as “cherry picking the best deals” and “better risk control.”
In sum, the different approaches to private equity investing—the traditional intermediated
partnerships versus direct investing—present a tradeoff between cost and investment quality.
Fund investing is high cost, but the average deal invested by funds may be of higher quality;
direct investing is lower cost, but the typical transaction may be of worse quality. The benefit of
direct investing, therefore, depends on this tradeoff.
Despite growing interest among LPs to “go direct,” no empirical evidence exists on this
interesting phenomenon. Do LPs do better with their direct investments than with their fund
investments? Within “direct investments”, do co-investments (which are generated by the GPs)
outperform solo deals (which are generated by the LPs)? One might expect this to be the case if

10

GPs are more “skilled” in selecting investments and if the higher costs (fees and carry) do not
dissipate all the upside. But the opposite may be true if LPs are just as skilled in deal selection or
if there are agency costs with co-investing. Our study provides the first analysis of these
questions.

3. Data
The data used for the analysis was obtained from seven institutional investors. Getting
access to these data posed certain complexities. This information was highly sensitive, and the
institutional investors wanted to be sure that neither the individual transactions nor the investors
themselves could be identified. This concern necessitated negotiating in each case a data
protection agreement. Given these high transaction costs, we focused on eliciting participation
from institutions with long-standing direct investment programs (and typically, considerable
experience with private equity in general). Thus, it can be anticipated that the participating firms
are among the more sophisticated private equity investors in the industry.
Each of the seven contributing investors provided us the complete history of their direct
investments in private equity. While the groups were generally larger and more sophisticated
than the typical LP, we sought to ensure that they were representative in other respects. The
investors were based in North America, Europe, and Asia. No more than two groups were from
any individual country. They included university, corporate, and government-affiliated entities.
In each case, the institution provided us with two sets of data:
•

The first of these was the characteristics of the investments made (date, amount of equity
and debt invested, etc.). The total sample contains 392 investments made between 1991
and 2011. In most cases, the firms receiving the funds were identified by name; by two

11

cases, only by code number. In the former cases, we researched their characteristics at the
time of the transaction using CapitalIQ and other business databases. In the latter cases,
the institution provided us with the characteristics of the transaction (e.g., industry and
headquarters location).
•

The second data set consisted of the performance of the investments. This typically
consisted of a series of cash flows and valuations for each transaction, running from the
time of the investment until either its exit or the time the data was provided (the second
or third quarter of 2011). We were able to replicate the performance calculations
provided us by the LPs, and resolved any discrepancies through discussions with them.
So the differences in performance cannot be attributed to methodological differences.
As any self-reported data, our sample is likely not representative of the direct investments

universe. In Table I we evaluate the nature of the reporting bias. Panel A compares basic
statistics of the participating institutions in our sample with all others listed in the Thomson
VentureXpert Limited Partners Database. It should be noted that even the data compiled in this
database are far from an exhaustive depiction of LP activity, reflecting institutional investors’
unwillingness to communicate their investment choices and the lack of a statutory requirement
for most limited and general partners to reveal fundraising activity (see the discussion in Lerner,
et al., 2007, and Hochberg and Rauh, 2011).
The comparison suggests that the private equity programs in our sample are newer and
larger than the other LPs in the Thomson database. The average year that a private equity
investment program was founded in our sample institutions was 1992, five years after the overall
LP universe. On the other hand, total assets under management in mid-2012 averaged $94 billion
for our participating institutions, more than double the average size of the investors in the overall

12

Thomson LP universe. Total alternative assets under management averaged $21 billion among
our participating groups, 2.6 times the overall average of $8 billion. The average private equity
allocation was also slightly higher among our sample than overall: 15.8% versus 13.2%. Finally,
our sample investors on average have 31 fund commitments that have been identified by
VentureXpert (their compilations are highly incomplete), more than four times the 7.4 average in
the overall LP universe. Thus, overall, our sample represents large institutional investors who are
particularly active in alternative investing and have significant private equity exposures.
[TABLE I]
A specific concern for our sample is that investors who collaborated with our study could
be more experienced than the average LP in pursuing direct investing. This means that the direct
investments in our sample could be better performing than the overall direct investments
population. Note that even in the presence of such a selection bias, there are insights that we can
learn from comparing solo and co-investments by the same investors.
To understand better if our results are generalizable, we first compared the performance
(proxied for by exit patterns) of our direct investment sample made by the seven contributing
LPs compared to a broader sample of direct investments obtained from Capital IQ made by other
LPs. Results are reported in the top half of Table I Panel B. To do this analysis, we first manually
identified 150 limited partners from over 6,000 private equity investors appearing in Capital IQ.
Then we searched for deals that involve one of these 150 limited partners as a “buyer”. In this
way, we identified 651 direct investment transactions in Capital IQ. (We do not use this sample
for our core analysis because we do not have detailed cash flow data for them; cash-flow data is
unique to the proprietary data that we collected. But they can help us at least partially assess the

13

sample selection bias problem.) We compare the exit outcomes of this sample with our sample.4
The results show that there are no significant differences in terms of the exit patterns between the
direct investments done by our seven LPs and the other LPs, alleviating the sample selection
concern that our results might be over-stating the general performance of direct investment
programs.
As our main analysis compares direct investments with traditional fund investments by
our seven LPs, we also sought to check/validate our overall conclusion by comparing the
performance of direct investments made by other LPs identified above with traditional fund
investments. This is again to explore whether our results are generalizable. Specifically, we
compare the exit patterns of the 651 direct investment deals identified from Capital IQ above to
the exit rates of over 20,000 other deals (i.e., traditional PE fund deals) from Capital IQ. Results
are reported in the bottom table in Table I, Panel B. This analysis is admittedly crude, but
directionally consistent with our main finding: Direct investments appear to perform well, having
higher IPO rates (although statistically insignificant) and lower bankruptcy rates (significant at
the 10% level). Interestingly, direct investments are also significantly more likely to have a
secondary buyout as an exit and exits of unknown types (which tend to be poorly performing)
account for a smaller fraction in the direct sample.

4. Results: Performance comparison
In this section, we undertake three sets of univariate comparisons between the
performance of direct and partnership investments: First, we undertake the baseline comparison
of the performance net of fees and carried interest. Second, we examine the performance

14

adjusted as well for the estimated internal costs of managing the programs. In a third
comparison, we look at performance adjusted for the contemporaneous returns of public equity
markets.
A. Net Performance
The distribution of 392 direct investments in our sample is presented in Table II. The
investments are significant in magnitude, totaling nearly 23 billion dollars. Roughly 73% of the
sample by the number of deals and 61% by the overall amount invested are co-investments. (Of
course, this only represents the activity of seven large investors.) By way of comparison, over the
same period from the beginning of 1991 and the third quarter of 2011, LPs’ total commitment to
private equity funds globally was $1.6 trillion, again as estimated by Thomson Reuters.
As Figure 2 shows, the majority of the direct investments in our sample are concentrated
in the most recent period. Thus, direct investing represents still a small, but a meaningful and
growing, part of institutional investors’ total private equity investing. One striking pattern is the
manner in which the number, and especially the dollar volume of investments appears to crest
around years that are among the peak of private equity investing more generally, particularly in
2007.
[TABLE II & FIGURE 2]
We focus on two measures of performance: the ratio of total value, which is the sum of
distributed and residual capital, to the amount paid into the fund (abbreviated TV/PI) and the
internal rate of return, or IRR. We focus on these measures, as most published performance
benchmarks for private equity funds employ these metrics. These measures have significant
limitations, including not adjusting for the risk of the investments. However, in this paper we
will be focusing on the differences between performance of the investments in our sample and

15

the benchmarks. Thus, we implicitly assume that the leverage and other risk measures for
transactions in our sample are comparable to that of the benchmarks. (Where possible, we will
match the benchmarks by type of investments and geography.)
Two patterns are apparent in the performance data reported in Table II. First, because the
direct investments are concentrated in years with relatively lower performance—again, similar to
commitments to and investments by private equity partnerships—the performance of direct
investments are considerably better when years are equal weighted than when they are weighted
by the amount invested. For example, for solo investments, TV/PI goes down from an equalweighted average of 3.98 across the years to 3.08 when weighted by amount invested; IRR goes
down from 30.17% to 16.82%.
A second pattern is the disparity of performance between solo and co-investments: the
solo investments made by LPs on their own perform substantially better than co-investments
with GPs. While investment-weighted mean TV/PI and IRR are 3.08 and 16.82% for solo
investments, they are 1.20 and -0.09% for co-investments. The poor performance of coinvestments appears to be highly related to the “hotness” of the PE market, measured by total
fund commitments. In unreported analysis, we find that while the correlation between TV/PI of
solo investments and total fund commitments is -0.18, while it is -0.59 for co-investments. Using
IRRs as the performance metric, the correlation with total fund commitments is -0.04 for solo
investments and -0.51 for co-investments. 5 Thus it is safe to conclude that the underperformance of co-investments is particularly related to the well-documented cyclicality of PE
performance.
5

The same conclusion holds if we use total PE fund disbursements as a measure of PE market
“hotness”. For instance, the correlation between TV/PI and fund disbursements for solo deals is 25%, but it is -67% for co-investments.
16

An important difference between direct investing and traditional private equity investing
is the absence of a fund structure. Typical performance measures such as those provided by
Thomson VentureEconomics, Preqin, and Burgiss (which we use later to benchmark our results)
use fund, or portfolio performance, whereas in our direct investment sample each investment is
treated individually. Given that we look at capital-weighted averages this does not make a
difference for TV/PI. But this does affect the IRR calculation: the IRR of a portfolio is not the
value-weighted IRR of its investments. Thus we also calculate pseudo “portfolio IRRs” for our
direct investments. This is done by treating investments initiated in the same year by the same
investor as one portfolio regardless of the year of any follow-on investments. The last vertical
panel of Table II reports these “portfolio IRRs”. Once we weight these annual portfolio IRRs by
amount invested, we again observe the under-performance of co-investments (average portfolio
IRR is 9.68%) relative to solo-investments (average portfolio IRR of 14.58%).
To compare the performance of the investors in our data-set to those of investments in
private equity partnerships, we use three major benchmarks of private equity partnership
performance: Preqin, Thomson VentureXpert, and Burgiss. Which of these benchmarks
accurately reflect the private equity industry as a whole is a controversial issue (see the
discussion in Harris, et al., 2011). Rather than designating one benchmark as the best, we sought
to use all three.
We obtained the three benchmarks for funds closed in each vintage year, for each distinct
geographic region reported (typically the U.S. and all other, or else the U.S., Europe, and all
other) and deal type (venture capital or buyout). We compute these benchmarks through
September 30, 2011 to most closely match the data we received from our LPs. For each data

17

source and for each vintage year, we downloaded the unweighted and capital-weighted average
rate of return (IRR) and unweighted and capital-weighted average investment multiple (TV/PI).
One important feature of the data is summarized in Figure 3. The benchmarks computed
by Preqin, Thomson, and Burgiss are reported net of fees and carried interest (profit sharing)
paid to the general partners. The direct investment returns were also universally provided to us
on a net basis, that is, less any transaction fees and carried interest charged by the GPs. So, our
first comparison is of the net returns to the LPs (the third line of Figure 3).
[FIGURE 3]
A subtle issue of timing arises when we construct benchmarks. For the direct deals, we
have the dates when the transactions were undertaken. The year of the direct deals, such as in
Table II, corresponds to the actual year of the investment. The performance of private equity
partnerships, however, is compiled by the major data vendors using the date of closing of the
fund. Private equity partnerships do not typically invest all their capital in the year that they
close, but instead the funds are invested in the several years thereafter. To deal with this issue,
we compare the performance of the direct deals to funds raised in the same year as the
transaction (“Lag 0”), as well as funds raised one and two years (“Lag 1” and “Lag 2”) before
the direct investment was made. Overall, however, our findings are robust to the timing of the
benchmark.
Table III provides an illustration of how a single data source (in this case, Preqin) can
yield multiple benchmarks. The benchmark can be computed using all private equity (e.g.,
venture capital, buyouts, and intermediate transactions) or just buyouts. Another permutation is
to use only U.S. funds, or those worldwide. A simple average can be taken across years, or the
data weighted by the amount invested. (As with the direct investments, weighted fund returns are

18

substantially lower.) Finally, as mentioned earlier, various lags can be taken, to address the
timing issues discussed in the paragraph above.
[TABLE III]
Table IV presents differences in performance between the direct investment sample and
the various benchmarks. Each number reported in Table IV corresponds to a difference between
the average performance in our sample and a benchmark. Panel A shows results for the TV/PI
comparison, and Panel B shows results for IRR. Shaded cells denote cases where the direct
investments outperform the benchmarks.
Table IV indicates that the solo direct investments outperform any market benchmark.
For TV/PI, the direct investments’ outperformance ranges from 2.1 to 2.5 of the money paid in
on an unweighted basis, and 1.6 and 1.8 of the money paid in when weighted by capital
invested/funds raised in a given year. For IRR, the outperformance is between 13% and 19% for
a simple average, and 7% and 10% for a weighted average. Though not reported, using the
differences between capital-weighted average IRRs and portfolio IRRs from Table II, one can
easily conclude that the outperformance of solo deals relative to benchmarks is robust to using
either methodology to compute IRRs. For example, the investment-weighted portfolio IRR for
solo deals is 14.58%, 2% lower than capital-weighted average IRR (16.82%). The
outperformance for solo deals over benchmarks, which is roughly 9%, will easily survive this
difference.
When it comes to co-investments, the picture is more mixed. Given that 288 deals (out of
392) in our sample are co-investments, the mixed results are also reflected in the overall sample.
For TV/PI, the unweighted co-investments outperform the Thomson benchmark (which Stücke
(2011) argues is biased downwards); and the unweighted IRR consistently outperforms all

19

benchmarks. However, the weighted results show consistent underperformance of coinvestments.
In general, when the results are weighted, the results are more consistent across different
benchmarks. Solo investments outperform the market benchmark, but co-investments
underperform.
[TABLE IV]
B. “Net-Net Performance”
The return metrics studied in the previous sub-section did not net out the LPs’ internal
costs of running the investment programs. In particular, it might be anticipated that the staff
salary and bonus costs incurred per unit of capital in direct investments would be greater than
those associated with a similar-sized partnership investment. The reason is that direct
investments require greater due diligence, more intensive structuring, and ongoing monitoring.
The legal costs may also be greater.
Several of the institutional investors in our study provided us with detailed data on their
costs of managing direct and partnership investment programs. These data allowed us to
undertake a second calculation, which might be termed a “net-net” comparison of performance,
i.e., an assessment of performance after considering all costs. (This comparison is depicted on
the bottom line of the first panel of Figure 3).
In particular, we received internal cost data (or at least estimates) from four of our
institutional investors. The estimates from all four were tightly bunched: The mean annual
internal cost for investing in private equity partnerships was 0.11% of committed capital, and the
mean annual cost of direct investing was 0.91% of committed capital. As we expected, investors’
internal cost of running direct investments was much higher than the cost of investing in funds.
20

In order to calculate “net-net” returns on direct investments, we assumed that these costs were
incurred over five years. We based this assumption on the estimates provided by institutional
investors in our sample. 6 For LPs’ investments in private equity funds, we assume the annual
0.11% internal cost will be incurred over five years, which is based on the unpublished
tabulations of the estimated duration of investments in funds by Stücke (2012).
For multiples (TV/PI), this adjustment involved subtracting 0.0055 (=5*0.0011) or
0.0455 (=5*0.0091) from the multiples for partnership and direct deals respectively. For the
more recent deals, we pro-rate the discount to account for the shorter horizon. For IRR, in cases
where we have cash flow data, we adjust the numbers accordingly and re-compute the IRR. In
cases where we do not have cash flow data, we estimate the impact by first approximating a cash
flow stream that maps to the IRR number (making assumptions based on the data in Robinson
and Sensoy (2011) and then looking at the consequences of the added fee.
Table V presents the “net-net” comparisons. The subtraction of the larger fees for direct
investments naturally reduces the difference in performance between our sample and the
benchmarks. However, the basic conclusion from these comparisons is the same as in the
previous sub-section. Strikingly, even after subtracting the larger internal cost of running direct
programs, direct investments still generally out-perform fund investments. The out-performance
is particularly strong among solo deals, while co-investments tend to under-perform fund
investments using various benchmarks. These patterns are true whether the results are equally
weighted or value weighted.
[TABLE V]
6

Strömberg (2008) concluded that the average holding period for exited deals by private equity
partnerships was 49 months. For obvious reasons, the use of a five-year horizon produces more
conservative estimates of differential performance of the direct investments. The overall
conclusions in this paper are qualitatively unaffected by using the Strömberg estimate.
21

C. Market-Adjusted Net Returns
We now turn again to a comparison of performance net of fees and carry, as in Section A.
However, now we look at the performance of both the funds and the benchmarks net of the
public market return.
Our rationale for examining market-adjusted returns is based on the work of Robinson
and Sensoy (2011). These authors argue that even though the absolute returns of private equity
partnership investments in peak years is lower, the returns in these years relative to public market
benchmarks do not differ significantly. This distinction is important, they argue, because of the
way in which institutional investors make investment decisions. In particular, institutions
frequently have a target amount reserved for investments in equities, whether public or private.
The returns of public and private equities are often highly correlated. Thus, the poor performance
of private equity during years with large numbers of investments may be not as damaging,
because the public market investments would be reduced by a corresponding amount. In other
words, for every dollar invested in direct investments, there is one less dollar invested in public
equities.
We have seen above that direct investments are also concentrated around market peaks. If
in a similar manner to the partnership investments, these investments are offset by reductions in
public market investments, the deleterious of such timing may be reduced. (Indeed, Lerner, et al.
(2013) presents an example of an institution that explicitly reduces public equity holdings when
making direct private investments.) Thus, even though direct investments are concentrated at
market peaks, their impact on overall performance may be less harmful than initially appears
because the funding for them reduces the allocation for public equities.

22

One way to empirically address this concern is to examine market-adjusted performance.
In particular, we repeat the analysis in Section 4.A, reducing the returns of both the direct
investments and the corresponding private equity benchmarks by the performance of the public
markets over the same period. The choice of market index depends on whether the deal in
question is a venture capital investment or a buyout, and whether it is a U.S. or global deal. For
U.S. buyout, we use the S&P 500 index; for U.S. venture, we use the Russell 2000. For non-U.S.
buyout and venture, we use MSCI EAFE Standard and Small Cap indices respectively. The
adjustment factor is contemporaneous to the year of the direct investment when we use lagged
benchmarks. 7
To calculate the adjustment, as in Section 4.B, we assume a holding period of five years
for both the direct investments and the partnerships. The time period over which the benchmark
is calculated for the partnership investments is from July 1 of the vintage year for a period of five
years, again following Stücke (2012). The procedure for the direct deals is similar. For year
where the period of five years exceeded the cut-off date for the index data, we used the index
through the end date of the return series. For example, U.S. buyout funds in 2003 (using Preqin
data) have an IRR of 23.3% and a multiple of 1.95. Direct buyout deals have a return of 28.06%
and a multiple of 2.05. We look at returns on S&P 500 and find a five year annualized return of
5.52% and a total multiple of 1.31. Thus, the market-adjusted numbers for the funds are 17.78%
(=23.3%-5.52%) and 0.64 (=1.95- 1.31); for the direct deals, 22.54% (=28.06% - 5.52%) and
0.74 (=2.05 - 1.31).

7

This is because the implied year of the investment is the same as the year of the direct
investment sample, regardless of the lag. Although the market adjustment itself does not move
regardless of the lag, the weights in the analyses change due to the lags.
23

The reported results correspond to difference in capital-weighted averages. Recall that
the adjustment essentially controls for the uneven distribution of performance and investment.
Had we done a market-adjusted calculation using unweighted data, the results would essentially
be equivalent to those in the left-hand columns of Table IV.
The results in Table VI show a similar picture to the earlier tables. Solo deals continue to
outperform the relevant benchmarks, while co-investments lag in performance, particularly when
we examine the IRR.
[TABLE VI]
5. Results: Sources of Performance Differences
To better understand the drivers of the performance differences, we conduct multivariate
regression analyses of the performance difference between direct investments and their dealmatched benchmarks. In particular, we match each transaction to the most appropriate industry
and deal type (stage, geography, and year) benchmark. In this way, we sought to understand
which direct investments performed particularly well.
We first perform a simple assessment of the performance. The results are reported in
Table VII. The dependent variable is the performance difference between direct investments and
the most comparable private equity fund benchmark. For non-U.S. deals, we are missing many of
the benchmarks: for instance, benchmarks by stage of deal are frequently missing from the
commercial data sources. So for each deal, we compute a benchmark in one of two ways. First,
we compute the returns net of (i) the aggregate index for private equity returns of funds of that
investment type, regardless of geography, as well as (ii) the aggregate index for private equity
returns of funds of that region, regardless of investment type. These two sets of corrections are
denoted as “Investment type” and “Region.”
24

Because the matching of the benchmark is at the deal level, these numbers are not
directly comparable to the ones reported in Tables IV through VI. We report in each case the
benchmark with a one- and two- year lags. In addition to a constant, the specification includes a
dummy variable indicating that a deal is a solo investment (as opposed to a co-investment). The
standard errors are clustered by investor (that is, in seven clusters).
Consistent with the non-parametric results, Table VII indicates that solo investments
invariably perform better than the co-investments. The performance differentials are statistically
and economically significant in magnitude: the TV/PI multiple is higher by about 4 and IRR is
higher by about 13-15 percentage points. The constant term, which estimates the mean
outperformance of all direct investments relative to their deal-specific benchmarks, is never
significant using TV/PI and always significantly negative using IRR, implying that coinvestments underperform traditional private equity investments. (The results for benchmarks
matched on investment type and region are nearly identical. In the subsequent analyses, we only
focus on the investment type benchmark.)
We do not observe the set of investments available for co-investments and therefore
cannot directly rule out LPs’ lack of skill in selecting co-investments. However, the fact that the
same LPs outperform the private equity fund benchmarks in their solo investments suggests that
co-investments suffer from either insufficient time and/or other resources to conduct duediligence (investments demand) or else a “lemons problem” (investments supply).
[TABLE VII]
As discussed in Section 2, the outperformance of solo direct investments could be
consistent with a series of non-mutually exclusive explanations. In Table VIII, we examine the
relative performance of investments in venture deals, which constitute 14% of our sample, as

25

well as targets in high research and development (R&D) industries. Venture deals are often seen
as intrinsically riskier than buyouts and potentially require higher active management skills. The
first two specifications for each benchmark appearing in Table VIII indicate that not only coinvestments, but also solo investments in venture deals, underperform the portfolio benchmark.
The analysis includes fixed effects for the investor, year, and the target’s industry.
The second set of specifications reported in Table VIII examines information costs of
direct investments, as proxied for by R&D expenses scaled by assets. Industries with high R&D
expenses are likely to be associated with high due diligence and monitoring costs. Similar to
venture deals, investment in such industries may require more active management. We find that
solo investments substantially underperform in industries that face higher information cost
(higher R&D/Assets). This qualitative result holds for both TV/PI and IRR, but is statistically
significant only for IRR. Together with the results for venture (as well as that for proximate deals
below), this finding suggests limits to the ability of LPs to generate value in direct investments.
In particular, the outperformance of solo investments seems limited to settings where
information costs are not too great. In more opaque settings, the difficulties of either investment
screening or active managing/monitoring seem to reduce their ability to add value.
[TABLE VIII]
In Table IX, we use the proximity between the institutional investor and the investment
target—measured in hundreds of kilometers—as another proxy for information cost/familiarity
with the target company. We find that distance between the investor and the target firm
negatively impacts the investment performance of solo deals. While the distance variable alone is
not significant, its interaction with the solo dummy is consistently negative and statistically
significant for TV/PI regressions, indicating that solo-investments made in targets far away from

26

the institutional investors’ location perform worse, all else equal. This finding is consistent with
the notion that there is a role for private, local information when making direct investments, and
that investing and deal monitoring becomes less effective when distance increases (for similar
evidence from public markets, see Coval and Moskowitz, 2001).
Collectively, our evidence on venture deals, higher R&D industries, and proximity leads
to a consistent conclusion: while solo investments generally outperform benchmarks (and coinvestments), investors’ ability to outperform is curtailed for situations where information cost is
high. This conclusion is consistent with the information advantage argument often offered for
using financial intermediaries (in this setting, professions PE fund managers).
[TABLE IX]
In Table X, we focus on our LPs’ ability to time the market. Earlier analysis included
year fixed effects, which absorb any timing differences. Timing skills and investment skills
(either in investment picking or active management) are not mutually exclusive; but it is well
known that poor investment timing is a main driver of under-performance in private equity. To
measure timing ability, we add indicator variables for peak years of the private equity cycle
(1998 to 2000 and 2005 to 2007). As in earlier tables, given that outperformance is manifested
in solo direct investments, we also include interaction terms between the solo indicator and the
peak year dummies.
We find that the peak year dummy itself does not affect the relative performance of direct
investments relative to benchmarks. However, the out-performance of solo deals over coinvestments is particularly pronounced in peak years, which is when private equity funds
perform particularly poorly (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005). The interaction between the solo dummy
and the peak year dummy is statistically significant throughout the TV/PI and the IRR

27

regressions. For IRR results, the outperformance of direct investments is only statistically
significant for the peak years. This result indicates that the normally deleterious effect of poor
investment timing on performance is much less severe for investors’ solo transactions than for
their co-investments. This supports LP’s claims that direct investments offer more flexible
timing of the PE market.
[TABLE X]
Finally, we focus on co-investments and explore potential sources of their
underperformance. One of the most striking and also intriguing finding of this paper is that the
same LPs can out-perform private equity benchmarks in their solo investments yet they
underperform in their co-investments. This suggests that the under-performance is probably not
due to poor investment skill (lack of good investment professionals). Instead, this suggests that
either LPs are time and resource-constrained when it comes to co-investments, or there are other
agency costs with co-investments. For example, our analysis on timing above indicates that coinvestments under-perform the most during “peak” years when fund commitment and investment
pace in private equity is high in general. This can happen not only because in peak years more
co-investments are done, 8 but also if the deals offered to the LPs by the GPs are of poor quality
(a “lemons” problem). In this section, we want to understand better the role of selection effects:
which deals become available to limited partners for co-investments? And does that help explain
the poor performance? For five of the investors in our sample we know the identity of the
sponsors (the general partner leading the investment). Thus, we can compare these transactions
with the broader sample of the sponsor’s investments.

8

Graphically, Figure 2 illustrates that more co-investments are indeed done in peak years.
28

Co-investments typically are done through a separate investment vehicle alongside the
traditional private equity fund investment. So we match co-investments in our sample to the
corresponding fund that invested in the same deal and compare the performance of the deal to the
performance of the fund as a whole from Pitchbook, Preqin and other sources. We are able to
identify 73 co-investments where we know the performance of the associated fund. These
transactions have 114 fund matches because of “club deals,” or transactions with multiple
sponsors.
The first thing to note it that deals with co-investments are substantially larger than a
typical deal in the GP’s portfolio. Table XI compares the typical co-investment—with a mean
enterprise value of $2,692 million—with the GPs’ other deals as identified in CapitalIQ. (We
restrict the comparison to transactions done two, three, and five years before the transaction to
ensure comparability.) Each of the differences reported is statistically significant, and the
difference is economically meaningful as well: on average, co-investments’ enterprise value is
nearly three times larger than the median contemporaneous deal done by the same GP. The large
size discrepancy between deals with co-investments and GP’s other investments indicates that
there is selection on the GP’s side: LPs are invited to co-invest when GPs need extra capital.
To understand whether these deals as attractive as the other transactions undertaken by
the fund, we look at their ex-post performance as compared to that of the fund. The results are
shown in Figure 4. On average, IRRs of investments chosen for co-investments are more than
8% lower than the overall fund performance, a difference which is significant at the five percent
confidence level. 9 The difference for TV/PI however is not economically or statistically
significant. Put together, if performance is used as an ex-post (and imperfect) measure of deal
9

The difference is understated, since the fund performance is not net of the deal where the coinvestment was made.
29

quality, the result does indicate that co-investments are of lower quality; in particular, although
these investments may generate the same cash multiples as the funds, they take longer to exit
(and hence have significantly lower IRR). 10
[TABLE XI & FIGURE 4]
6. Concluding remarks
The impact of financial intermediation has been a subject of considerable examination in
the finance literature. On the one hand, these middlemen should be able overcome transaction
cost and information problems; on the other, they may be prone to agency conflicts which affect
their performance.
The theoretical literature on intermediation motivated this analysis, which focuses on the
private equity setting, where disintermediation has become increasingly common. Using
proprietary data compiled for this study, this paper offer the first large sample evidence of the
relative performance of direct investments by large institutional investors. Our sample includes
392 deals by a set of institutions, both co-investments and direct investments, covering over
twenty years. We find robust evidence of the outperformance for the solo direct investments in
our sample. However, the same investors show mixed results in their co-investment deals. We
find that outperformance of solo direct investments is due in part to their ability to exploit
information advantages by investing locally and in settings where information problems are not
too great, as well as to their relative outperformance during market peaks. The underperformance
of co-investments appears to be associated with the higher risk of deals available for coinvestments.
10

Lopez-de-Silanes, et al. (2010) also provide evidence that deals that take longer to exit
typically have the same return multiple as quick exits, but have significantly lower IRR.
30

Our findings—as striking as they are—must be interpreted cautiously for several reasons.
First, it is not clear whether this result is a reflection of the fact that our sample consists of large
and sophisticated investors: small investors replicating a direct investment strategy may have
different experiences. Even though we tried to assess the sample selection bias, there is a risk of
over-generalizing our result. Nor is it clear whether returns on direct investment deals will
continue to be as successful as institutional investors expand their direct investment programs.
These limitations notwithstanding, the sharp contrast between the performance of solo
deals and that of co-investment deals indicate that there can be an agency problem when general
partners selectively offer deals to limited partners for co-investing. One question that arises is
whether repeated investment relationships between the LPs and the GPs, and hence the
reputational risk that GPs have vis-à-vis the LPs, helps mitigate this agency problem. To fully
assess this important question, more data and experience with direct investments is needed,
which we leave for future research.

Where possible we match co-investments in our sample to the corresponding fund. (Co-investments typically are
done through a separate investment vehicle alongside the traditional private equity fund investment.) The sample has
73 co-investments and 114 fund matches due to transactions with multiple sponsors. The figure plots distribution of
differences in performance between co-investments and the corresponding fund. Data for the funds is compiled from
Preqin. This is the standard box plot: the band inside the box corresponds to the median, bottom and top of the box
are the first and third quartile, dots are the adjoin values. ** indicates statistical significance at the 5% level.

Table I
Sample characteristics and evaluation of the selection bias
Panel A compares basic statistics of the participating institutions in our sample with all others listed in the Thomson
VentureXpert Limited Partners Database. Panel B evaluated our sample based on exit information. We manually
identified out-of-sample limited partners and the direct investment they made from Capital IQ. Initial public offering
(IPO), trade sale, secondary buyout, and bankruptcy are different exit types. “All exits” includes confirmed exits
with unknown type. ***, **, and * indicates statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table II
Direct investments and co-investments performance (by year of investment), 1991-2011
This table shows performance of the direct investments by year. All corresponds to the full sample of direct investments. Solo and Co-inv. correspond to the independent direct
investments and co-investments sub-samples, respectively. TV/PI is the total value (sum of distributed and residual capital) divided by paid in capital. We calculate the capitalweighted average TV/PI for investments done in a given year for each investor; the reported numbers are the simple averages across investors. IRR corresponds to value-weighted
average IRR for investments done in a given year for each investor. Portfolio IRR treats all investments done by the same investor in a given year as one portfolio (regardless of the
date of other cash flows). Both set of IRR numbers correspond to the simple average across investors in our sample. For seven (out of 392) investments we do not have cash flows
data, but only the IRR, we include these as separate observations in computing the portfolio IRR.

Table IV
Comparative analysis of direct investments performance, net returns
Each number corresponds to a difference in means of performance measures between deals in our direct investments sample (reported in Table II) and a private
equity benchmark. The benchmarks—Preqin, Thomson Venture Economics (VE) and Burgiss—correspond to cumulative performance as of September 30, 2011
by fund vintage year. The first nine columns correspond to simple average across the years, i.e., each year portfolio and the corresponding benchmark are
compared and averaged, regardless of the amount invested. In the last nine columns, the comparison of the benchmark and the portfolio observations is weighted
by the amount of capital invested in that year (capital invested for our sample and total funds raised for the benchmark sample). “Lag 0” corresponds to a
contemporaneous, 1991-2010, comparison of returns. In columns “Lag 1” and “Lag 2,” the benchmark is lagged one year (1990-2009) and two years (19892008) respectively. Shaded cells are those where the direct investments perform better.

Table V
Comparative analysis of direct investments performance, “net-net” returns
Each number corresponds to a difference in means of performance measures between deals in our direct investments sample (reported in Table II) and a private
equity benchmark. The returns considered in this table are net of in-house investment cost and administrative cost, or “net-net” returns. (See Figure 3 for
definitions.) The benchmarks—Preqin, Thomson Venture Economics (VE) and Burgiss—correspond to cumulative performance as of September 30, 2011 by
fund vintage year. The first nine columns correspond to simple average across the years, i.e., each year portfolio and the corresponding benchmark are compared

contemporaneous, 1991-2010, comparison of returns. In columns “Lag 1” and “Lag 2,” the benchmark is lagged one year (1990-2009) and two years (19892008) respectively. Shaded cells are those where the direct investments perform better.

Table VI
Comparative analysis of direct investments performance, market-adjusted returns
Each number corresponds to a difference in means of performance measures between deals in our direct investments
sample and a private equity benchmark. The returns considered in this table are market adjusted. (See Figure 3 for
definitions.) The benchmarks—Preqin, Thomson Venture Economics (VE) and Burgiss—correspond to cumulative
performance as of September 30, 2011 by fund vintage year. The first nine columns correspond to simple average
across the years, i.e., each year portfolio and the corresponding benchmark are compared and averaged, regardless of
the amount invested. In the last nine columns, the comparison of the benchmark and the portfolio observations is
weighted by the amount of capital invested in that year (capital invested for our sample and total funds raised for the
benchmark sample). “Lag 0” corresponds to a contemporaneous, 1991-2010, comparison of returns. In columns
“Lag 1” and “Lag 2,” the benchmark is lagged one year (1990-2009) and two years (1989-2008) respectively.
Shaded cells are those where the direct investments perform better.

Table VII
Multivariate analysis of direct investments and co-investments performance
In this table we look at the cross-section of deals; each observation is a separate direct investment. The dependent
variable is a deal performance minus the corresponding benchmark. The benchmark is lagged by one year (“Lag 1”
in the previous tables); i.e., a direct investment in year T is compared to performance of a fund closed in year T-1.
The Solo independent variable indicates solo direct investments. Standard errors are clustered by the investor from
which we obtained the data. ***, **, and * indicates statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level,
respectively.

Table VIII
Factors influencing the performance differences: Venture deals and R&D intensity
Each observation is a direct investment. The dependent variable is the deal performance minus the corresponding
benchmark. The benchmark is lagged by one year (“Lag 1” in the previous tables); i.e., a direct investment in year T
is compared to performance of a fund closed in year T-1. Each coefficient reported in the table is a marginal effect.
The Solo independent variable indicates solo direct investments. R&D/assets is the average industry research and
development scaled by assets. Venture deal is a dummy indicating whether the deal is a venture deal (as opposed to
a buyout investment). All regressions include investment year and investor dummy variables. Two-digit Standard
Industrial Classification dummy variables are included in the first two specifications for each benchmark. Standard
errors are clustered by investor from which we obtained the data. ***, **, and * indicates statistical significance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Factors influencing the performance differences: Distance to the target
Each observation is a direct investment. The dependent variable is the deal performance minus the corresponding
benchmark. The benchmark is lagged by one year (“Lag 1” in the previous tables); i.e., a direct investment in year T
is compared to performance of a fund closed in year T-1. The Solo independent variable indicates solo direct
investments. Distance is the distance between the headquarters of the institutional investor and that of the portfolio
company, in hundreds of kilometers. Venture deal is a dummy indicating whether the deal is a venture deal (as
opposed to a buyout investment). All regressions include investment year, investor, and two-digit Standard
Industrial Classification dummy variables. Standard errors are clustered by the investor from which we obtained the

Table XI
Co-investments deal size
This table compares the enterprise value of the co-investments in our sample with other deals in the same general
partners’ portfolios. To make this comparison, we look at deals where the GP name or the name of the target is
available. For each co-investment, we construct benchmarks using all of the same GP’s deals from CapitalIQ in the
five-, three-, and two-year window preceding the co-investment. ***, **, and * indicates statistical significance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
