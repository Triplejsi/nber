Real Exchange Rate Variability:
An Empirical Analysis of the Developing Countries Case

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential role of
monetary and real factors in explaining real exchange rate variability in

developing countries. For this purpose two indexes of real effective exchange
rate variability that measure short—term and long—term variability were

constructed for 30 countries. The results obtained, using a generalized least
squares procedures on cross section data, indicate that real exchange rate

variability has been affected both by real and monetary factors. In
particular it was

found

that more unstable nominal exchange rate policies were

reflected in higher real exchange rate instability in the short—run; more
unstable domestic credit policies resulted in higher short—term real exchange
rate variability; and more unstable external terms of trade also affected
positively the degree of real exchange rate instability.

1. Introduction
During the last few years real exchange rate variability has increased

substantially both in developed and developing countries. From a policy point
of view, it is important to understand what the main causes of this increased

real exchange rate instability are. To the extent that the causes of real
exchange rate instability are policy related ——

for

exauple, related to the

nominal exchange rate system or to the degree of instability of domestic
monetary policy —— economic authorities could, in principle, be able to imple-

ment policies aimed at reducing this variability. On the other hand, if real
exchange rare variability depends on exogenous or structural factors ——

like

changes in the external teens of trade — the domestic authorities will have
less maneuvering room to reduce it.1
Some earlier papers have analyzed orne empirical aspects of the real

exchange rate variability problem. For example, Korteweg (1980) discussed the
possible sources of real exchange rate instability for a group of OECD countries, and pointed out that there is a presumption that real exchange rate
variability had responded to shocks generated both from the monetary and real

sides. Relleiner (1981), in an extensive study on exchange rate systems in
developing countries, decomposed the sources of real exchange rate variability
between external sources, or sources related to exchange rate movements

between major currencies, and "other" sources. Re found out that even though
external sources had been important, in a large number of countries the

"other" factors had dominated. Although he doesn't explicitly test other
factors he mentions the potential roles of tens of trade changes and domestic
monetary policy.

More recently some papers have analyzed the causes of real exchange rate
variability within the context of deviations from purchasing power parity

(PPP). Stocionan (1983), for example, developed a model to investigate the
role of nominal and real disturbances on real exchange rate instability.
&ccording to his model, the exchange rate system should be neutral with

respect to the degree of exchange rate variability. However, StocIan's
results for a group of 38 developed and developing countries reject this
proposition, and show that the variability of the real exchange rate has been

higher under a floating rate system. Yuravlivker (1982) also found out that,
for a group of four developing countries, real exchange rate variability was
affected positively by the instability of the nominal exchange rate policy.
DeCrauwe, Janssens and Lelianert (1984) and DeGrauwe and Rosiers (1984)

investigated the proposition that real exchange variability is caused by
monetary disturbances. DeGrauwe, Jansserts and Lelianert (1984), for example,
used cross—section data to analyze the effects of inflation and monetary
disturbances on real exchange rate instability increases with the variability

of inflation and money growth rates. DeGrauwe and Rosiers (1984) developed a
model based on Mzenman (1984) to investigate the causes of real exchange rate
variability during the more recent period. This model predicts that in addition to monetary disturbances the degree of openness of the economy affects

positively real exchange rate instability. Using cross—section data for 39
developed and developing countries for 1970—82 they present evidence that
supports the hypothesis that monetary instability enhances real exchange rate

variability; their results, however, provide little support to the hypothesis

that openness has affected real exchange rate variability. Melvin and Bernstein (1984), on the other hand, analyze the role of real factors (only) on
real exchange rate variability. TJsing cross—country data for 37 countries
they regress a measure of variability of a bilateral real exchange rate
against an index of exports concentration and a measure of a country's degree

3

of openness. They find that the coefficients of these two variables are
significantly positive.2
ft is somewhat surprising that most empirical studies dealing with real

exchange rate variability have concentrated either on the role of monetary

factors, or on the role of real (structural) factors. In theory, however,
both types of disturbances will be important in determining real exchange rate

variability in the short run.3 In this paper this problem is tackled directly, by investigating the potential role of monetary and real factors in
explaining real exchange rate variability, using cross—country data for a

group of developing countries. In this paper a fairly pragmatic approach has
been taken. Rather than developing a specific model for explaining real
exchange rate variability, implications that emanate from a number of theoret-

ical models are considered in the empirical analysis. In this way a more
general set of possible determinants of real exchange rate variability is
considered.

Contrary to previous work, in this paper the possible role of terms of

trade instability is explicitly taken into account. Although some authors
have recognized the theoretical importance of terms of trade movements in
explaining real exchange rate variability, the few empirical studies on the

subject have not taken this variable explicitly into account.4 Also contrary
to previous work —— which has concentrated on bilateral rates ——

this

paper

uses a measure of variability of the teal effective exchange rate. This paper
uses a more general estimation method than previous studies. In particular,
homoscedasticity is not imposed; the error's variance is allowed to vary

across countries. Finally, in this paper measures of both short—run and long—
term (or long—wave) real exchange rate variability are used in the regression
analysis.

Ii. Real Exchange Rate Variability in Developing Countries: An Overview
During the last 15 years or so real exchange rate variability has
irtéreased substantially.5 However, this higher instability has not affected

all countries alike. In fact, here have been extremely large cross—country
differences in real exchange rate instability. The extent and characteristics
of real exchange rate variability for a selected group of developing countries
are illustrated in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1 presents, for a group of 30 developing countrtes, data on the
mean, variance, coefficient of variation, mininann and maxinnzn values for an

index of real effective exchange rate. (See below for an exact definition of
this index.) For most countries these statistics were computed using data for
the period between the third quarter of 1971 and the second quarter of 1984.

From these figures — and especially the minimum—maximira values —

it

is

apparent that during the recent period real exchange rate variability has been

substantial. The case of Sri Lanka is the most dramatic, where the difference
between the maximum and ntinirnum values of the Index exceeds 150 points. This

contrasts sharply with, for example, Mauritius where this difference was only

19 points. The striking difference in real exchange rate variability across
countries can be better illustrated by the ratio of the highest to the lowest

coefficient of variation of the real exchange rate. For this period this
ratio was almost equal to nine!

Table 2 contains the same variables for the same group of countries for
the period between the first quarter of 1965 and the second quarter of 1971.

These indexes also show an important cross—country variability in the real

exchange rate for this earlier period. It is interesting to compare Tables 1
and 2. As can be seen, the degree of real exchange rate variability, as
measured by the coefficient of variation of the effective real exchange rate

countries the coefficient of variation is higher for the more recent period
(1971—84) with the only exceptions being Ecuador, Korea arid Turkey.

III. Eapirical Results
In this section results obtained from the stitnation of real exchange rate

variability equations, using cross—section data, are presented. The estimations were performed using data both on short—term real exchange rate

variability and long—term (or long—wave) real exchange rate variability.6 The
long—wave variability index was computed using annual data for the 30 count-

ries in Table 1, for period 1972—83. The short—term variability indexes were
computed using quarterly data for a smaller group of countries (26) for

1972—83. The group of countries used was determined by the availability of

only a relatively small set of countries had quarterly data for the most

important variables. It would be expected that
play

the

monetary factors would

a more prominent role in explaining the short—term real exchange rate

variability, and that real or structural factors would be more important in
the explanation of long—wave variability.7

The possible roles of monetary and real factors in the explanation of
real exchange rate variability is analyzed by estimating the following log—
linear equation:8

111.1 The Data
Niost studies of real exchange rate instability have concentrated on

hilaterial real exchange rates.9 A problem with this practice, however, is
that it ignores possible important sources of real exchange rate instability

related to variations of exchange rates across trade partners. In this paper,
however, this problem is avoided by constructing a large data set for real

effective exchange rates for this group of developing countries)-0 For each

In the construction of this real effective exchange rate index the

following procedure was followed. (1) The weights (a's) were trade weights

9

constructed using data from the International Monetary Fund Direction of Trade

for 1975. (2) The ten larger partners in 1975 were used for the construction
of the index for each country. (3) The partner countries' WPIs were used as
While these assumptions

the Pt's and the home country CPI was used for

are somewhat arbitrary, they are defendable. First, for most countries 1975
was a fairly normal year and, consequently, its use as a base to compute the

a's is reasonable. Second, using the ten larger partner countries covers, for
most countries, well above 80% of total trade. Itreover, the inclusion of
other partners into the computation adds insignificant coverage to the REER
indexes, without affecting in a noticeable way the behavior of the index.

Also, using trade weights provides a more general view of the evolution of the
degree of competitiveness of a country than using. import or export weights.

The real exchange rate variability index for country n was constructed as
the coefficient of variation of the log of the real effective exchange rate:

k

l,...,k refers to the number of periods used in the

computation of vn, eat is the logarithu of the real effective exchange rate,

and e is the average of en. The advantage of this index of instability is
that it is mean free. This is an important property when dealing with cross—
country studies of real exchange rate variability, since different countries

can have significantly different means during a given period)1
In the regressions the following real or structural variables were used:
(1)

An openness index. For each period openness was measured as the average

propensity to import. The index was then constructed as the average value of
the average propensity to import during the relevant period. Melvin and
Bernstein (1984) have suggested that this variable will positively affect real

10

exchange rate instability. For the data sources, see the Appendix.

(2) variability index of the log of the terms of trade. The terms of trade
are defined as the ratio of export to import prices, and for all countries,

except Chile, the raw data were obtained from the IFS. The variability index
was computed as the coefficient of variation of the log of terms of trade.'2
Icatseli (1984) , Mussa (1984) and Edwards (1985), among others, have pointed

out that the external terms of trade will affect real exchange rate movements.

(3) In some long—wave variability regressions, the coefficient of variation
of real CDP growth was also incorporated as a proxy for real productivity
shocks (Korteweg (1980) and 1-lelleiner (1981)).13

In terms of monetary (or nominal) variables, the following were included

in the regressions: (a) Index of money (Ml) growth instability. Most models
of real exchange rate behavior and/or deviations from PT'P have pointed out

that monetary instability is an important source of real exchange rate van—
ability. The index was constructed as the coefficient of variation in Ml

growth. (b) Instability of domestic credit growth. This variable was
introduced in the analysis as an alternative measure of monetary instability.

The reason for this is that in some countries —— domestic credit is the
non etary aggregate more closely controlled by the conoraic authorities. The
raw data were taken from the IFS, and the instability index was constructed as
the coefficient of variation of domestic credit., growth. (c) Index of

volatility of domestic inflation. With other things given, a more variable
domestic rate of inflation is expected to result in a higher real exchange

rate variability (see Korteweg (1980)). Again the raw data were taken from
the IFS and the instability index was computed as the coefficient of variation

of the rate of inflation. (d) Index of volatility of nominal exchange rate
policy. Two alternative indexes were constructed. The first was defined as

11.

the coefficient of variation of the rate of devaluation of the nominal

effective exchange rate. The second index was defined as one plus the standard deviation of the rate of devaluation of each domestic currency with
respect to the 11.8. dollar. There are also two reasons for defining this

second index in this way. First, most developing countries have traditionally
used the 11.8. dollar as a benchmark to formulate their exchange rate policies.

Second, since some countries have maintained a fixed rate with respect to the

dollar throughout the period, the standard deviation of this rate of

devaluation is zero and cannot be logged.14 (3) Average level of domestic
inflation. A n*unber of authors, including Aizeninan (1984) have pointed out

that higher inflation levels will be translated into higher variability of the

real exchange rate. All these variables were constructed from raw data
obtained from the IFS.

111.2 Results for tong—Wave Real Exchange Rate Variability
In this section results obtained from the estimation of equations of the
type of (1), using instability indexes constructed with annual data are

reported. The regressions were performed using data for the 30 countries of
Table 1 for 1972—83, and were estimated using the generalized least squares
procedure suggested by Horn, Horn and Duncan (1975) to estimate heterosced—

astic variances. This method was used since the analysis of the residuals
obtained from OIJS regressions indicated the presence of heteroscedasticity.

In Table 3 the results for 1972—83 appear. Since the alternative
neasures of monetary instability used here are highly collinear, they were

introduced in the regressions one at a time. The results obtained are quite

interesting.'5 First, and contrary to previous results (i.e., DeCrauwe and
Rosiers (1984)) it was found that real or structural factors have played a

prominent role in explaining long—wave real exchange rate instability. More
specifically, the main source of explanation of real exchange rate variability
across countries during this period was the instability of the countries'

external terms of trade. This variable was significant at conventional levels
in all the equations where it was included. Second, these results also suggest that during this period the instability of the nominal exchange rate

policy — measured through the variability indexes of the nominal rate of
devaluation —— played a marginal role in explaining real exchange rate

variability. Third, other measures of monetary instability —— the variability
indexes of domestic credit growth, money growth and of inflation —— do not
appear to have played an important role.

In some sense it would appear that the results contradict the findings
reported by fleGrauwe and Liniart (1984) for a different period and group of

countries. This contradiction, however, is more apparent than real, since
they used short—tent instability indexes, whereas Table I results deal with

long—wave instability. s is discussed below, when a short—term variability
index is used, monetary sources do become important in the explanation of the
difference in real exchange rate variability across countries.
Surprisingly, perhaps, enough the openness coefficient was never

significant. In order to check whether this result —— which contradicts the
finding by Melvin and Bernstein (1984) —— was due to the fact that an alternative measure of structural instability (i.e., the terms of trade index) had

been included, a regression that excluded a, but included OF, was also
run. As can be seen from Table 3 In this case the openness index remains
insignificant. This indicates then, that at least for this period the degree
of openness of the economy has not been associated with the extent of real
exchange rate instability.16
111.3 Short—Terni Real Exchange Rate Variability

In Table 4 the results obtained from regressions using variability

indexes constructed with quarterly data for 1972—83 are presented. Data for a

subset of 23 of the countries in Table I were used)7 These results are quite
interesting and contrast with those obtained when the long—wave variability

indexes were used. The results in Table 4 show that, as expected, in the
short run monetary factors play a more important role in explaining real

exchange rate variability. Now, the coefficient of the index of instability
of domestic credit creation turned out to he large and significantly different

from zero in every regression where it was included. Also, the indexes of
instability of nominal exchange rate policy are significant and positive. On
the other hand, these results indicate that real factors (i.e., terms of trade

variability, openness) don't play an important role in the explanation of
differences in short—run real exchange rate instability across countries.
Another interesting finding reported in Table 4 Is that there is some evidence

that a higher level of inflation will be associated with a higher degree of

short—run real exchange rate instability. As in the case of Table 3, the
openness coefficient was never significant, this corresponding to what
DeCrauwe and Rosiers (1984) had found in their study which also used a short—
term variability index.

The results presented in Table 4 have some important policy implications,

since they suggest that by pursuing more stable nominal exchange rate policies
countries could manage to reduce, in a significant way, the level of real
exchange rate instability in the short run.

TV. S.ary
In this paper the relative importance of real and monetary factors in
explaining recent real exchange rate variability in developing countries have

been investigated. The empirical evidence shows that in the last 15 years or
so real exchange rate variability has increased significantly. However, the
degree of real exchange rate variability has been quite uneven across
countries, with some countries experiencing variability almost ten times
higher than others.
tn

theory,

long—run equilibrium real exchange rates depend on the

behavior of a number of real variables, including the terms of trade and the

degree of openness of the economy (Mussa (1984)). ft the shorter run, however, real exchange rate movements will also be affected by monetary

disturbances, including the instability of the nominal monetary policy. From
a policy point of view it is important to determine the extent to which actual

real exchange rate variability stems from monetary and real disturbances. If
nominal policy—induced instability has been an important cause of real
exchange rate variability, there are policy options open to reduce it.

17

In this paper data on a group of developing countries were used to

investigate

and assess the relative importance of monetary and real factors.

The analysis focused both on long—wave and short—term variability. The

contrary to previous findings, indicate that real exchange
variability has been caused both by monetary and real disturbances,
results,

variables

rate
with real

being relatively more important in the explanation of long—wave

instability

and nominal variables playing a more prominent role in case of

short—term instability.
In terms of real disturbances the most prominent has been external terms
of trade variability, which was found to have played an important role in the

determination of long—run real exchange rate instability. In the shorter run,
however, it was found that no real variable had been important. Regarding
monetary disturbances, this study indicates that nominal exchange rate

instability has been the major and more persistent source of short—ten real
exchange rate instability in this group of countries.

From a policy perspective these results are important. They suggest that
a stable nominal exchange rate policy will help to substantially reduce real

exchange rate variability. There are a number of ways to reduce the degree of
instability of the nominal exchange rate, including the adoption of any vari-

ant of crawling—peg systems. On the other hand, it is well known that nominal
exchange rate instability is greatly enhanced by the adoption of a flexible
rate system (Frenkel and Mussa (1982)). To the extent that policyruakers want

to reduce real exchange rate variability, the result reported in this paper
cautions them against adopting a floating rate system.

18

FOOTTOT&S

1Some authors have recently pointed out that "explaining the large
persistent real exchange rate inoventents...[is] at the center of policy debate"

(Dornbusch, 1984, p. 63). It has been argued that "excessive" real exchange
rate variability has negative welfare effects. It reduces the level of
international trade, affects investment decisions and, in general, hampers

growth possibilities. On the welfare effects of real exchange rate instability see, for example, roes (1982) and Willet (1986). On the increase of real
exchange rate variability in the recent years, see Relleiner (1981), IMP

(1984). It should he noted that in IMP (1Q84) it is argued that this
increased instability has had little or no effects on international trade.

should be noted that the degree of significance is narginal. Also, a
problem with these results, as well as from those of the studies discussed
before, is that the variables used in the regression analysis explain a fairly
small proportion of the cross—country differences in real exchange rate
variability.

31n theory, in the short run, real exchange rate behavior will depend

both on monetary and real factors. See, for example, Mussa (1984, especially
section 1.6, pp. 37—43).

4it is important to realize that some authors have used the terms of

trade and the real exchange rate interchangeably. These two variables,
however, will not be equivalent in models with importables, exportables and

nontradable goods. See Williamson (1983) and Katseli (1984). In fact,
Katseli (1984) shows that the tine series properties of the terms

of

trade and

the real exchange rate have been significantly different for a group of
countries.

19

5See, for example, Helleirter (1981), IMF (1984), Cumby and Obstfeld (1984).

6Krueger (1983) has emphasized the importance of looking both at short—

term and long—term instability indexes. Melvin and Bernstein (1984) used
yearly data only; Yuravlivker (1982) used quarterly data only.

Der,rauwe,

Janssens and Lelianart (1984), DeGrauwe and Rosiers (1984) and Stoclo-aan (1983)

used monthly data only. DeCrauwe, Janssens and Lelianert (1984), DeGrauwe and
Rosiers (1984) and Melvin and Bernstein (1984) have also used

cross—country

data in their studies. Stockman (1982), on the other hand, used a variance
components method on pooled cross—section, time series data. An alternative
method for looking at real exchange variability is to estimate a model of real
exchange rate determination using time series and then test for heteroscedast—

icity. If heteroscedasticity is present an Engel's (1983) ARCH procedure can
be used to compute the conditional real exchange rate variance.
7See, for example, Mussa (1984).
8Aizenman (1984)

,

for

example, has postulated that real exchange rate

variability is a linear function of the variances of the underlying

shocks,

both real and monetary, affecting the economy. See also Mussa (1984), Frenkel
and Mussa (1985) and Korteweg (1980).

9Some of the more descriptive studies have also considered the
variability of the real effective exchange rate (Korteweg (1980), Helleiner
(1981)).

10Unfortunately data on real effective exchange rates are not readily

available for the developing countries. The series published by Morgan
Guarantee, for example don't go far enough back in time.
''The equilibrium level of the real exchange rate in general will differ

across countries. Consequently, even assuming that the actual and equilibrium
real exchange rates will coincide, on average, for each country, there is no

20

reason to expect that all countries will have the same mean. Williamson
(1983) also used coefficients of variation to compute nominal exchange rate

variability. Stocknan (1982) used the variance; the IMP

(1984) used period—

to—period changes; Ttatseli (1984) and Melvin and Bernstein used standard

deviations; and DeGrauwe, Janssens and Helinaert (1984) used mean absolute
changes.

'2Some authors have sometimes confused the real exchange rate and the
terms of trade.

It is important to stress that in a setup with exportables,

importables and nontradables, both from empirical and analytical perspectives,

these are two different variables. Analytically, the terms of trade are
defined as the relative price of exportables to importables, while the real

exchange rate is the relative price of tradables to nontradables. See, for
example, the discussion in Katseli (1984).
130f course, a problem with using a measure of growth variability is that

it is not clear to what extent it is a genuine exogenous variable.
l4Notice that in the construction of the indexes of instability of the
nominal exchange rate policy the rate of devaluation was used; whereas the
variability index for the real effective exchange rate was constructed using
levels data.

'5Note, however, that only a handful of coefficients turned out to be

significant. This — not uncommon in empirical works dealing with LDCs ——

indicates

that only a few variables have in fact been important in the

determination of real exchange rate instability in these countries. Several
aspects of these results are worth noting.

'6Regressions were also run using data for period 1960—71. The results
obtained were somewhat different from those reported in Table 3. First, there
iaa only weak support for the

hypothesis

that

terms

of trade instability

21

played a role in the explanation of real exchange rate

instability during this

early period. Second, and more important, there is rio evidence that during
this period real exchange rate instability was affected by monetary policy

disturbances. Also, these results indicate that during this earlier period
real exchange rate variability was greatly affected by the instability of

nominal exchange rate policy. This means that countries that had a more
variable rate of nominal devaluation also had a more unstable real exchange
rate.

relatively small number of countries have quarterly data on the

relvant variables. The countries included in these regressions are: Bolivia,
Brazil, Colombia, Cyprue, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia,
Greece, Guyana, Honduras, India, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Paraguay,
Peru, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Western Samoa and Chile.
