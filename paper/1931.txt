Efficient Contracts with Costly Adjustment:
Short-Run Employment Determination for Airline Mechanics

ABSTRACT

This paper presents an empirical analysis of firm—specific
employment and wage outcomes for mechanics in the domestic airline

industry. A dynamic contracting model is presented that incorporates
both costly employment adjustment and potential gaps between contract

wage rates and the opportunity value of workers' time. The model gives
a useful description of the employment-output linkage in the data, but
is less successful in capturing the dynamic relation between employment,
contract wage rates, and wage rates outside the airline industry.

The search for a credible interpretation of observed employment
patterns has lead to widespread interest in the notion of efficient

labor contracts)-" In contrast to traditional auction models of the
labor market, which relate fluctuations in employment directly to changes
in wage rates, contracting models permit a more flexible link between

wage payments and employment determination. According to the simplest
version of the efficient contracting hypothesis, in fact, the level of
employment maximizes the joint income of workers and the firm, while the
level of wages represents a pure transfer between them.

If this "strong

form" efficiency hypothesis is correct, then it calls into question a
wide variety of policy conclusions based on the assumed distortionary

effects of union wage differentials and short-term wage rigidities.V
A simple test of the efficient contracting hypothesis is provided
by a firm—level employment equation that includes both the wage rate at
the firm and some measure of the alternative wage available to

workers..! According to the strong form efficiency hypothesis, the
joint income of workers and the firm is maximized when the marginal

value product of labor equals its outside opportunity wage. If this
hypothesis is correct, employment is independent of firm—specific wage
rates and depends only on the alternative wage rate.

In the traditional

labor demand model, by comparison, the firm's profits are maximized when

the marginal value product of labor equals the firm—specific wage. If
this model is correct, then employment is independent of alternative

wage rates and depends only on the firm's wage rate. Finally, in a
general contracting model, labor is allocated between outside opportunities and contract employment on the basis of a shadow value that
varies with both firm—specific and alternative wage rates.

—2—

In a dynamic setting, however, tests of even simple efficient
contract models are complicated by the fact that alternative wage rates

may help to predict future contract wage rates. Suppose for example
that employment adjusts toward a target level that depends on a weighted

average of future contract wage rates. In this case, even if desired
employment is independent of alternative wages, current and lagged
alternative wages rates may enter the employment equation as predictors
of future contract wages.

In a dynamic model it is therefore necessary to sort out two
competing routes for the alternative wage to influence the level of

contract employment: (I) directly, through the appropriate
expression for the shadow value of labor; and (ii) indirectly, through
the statistical link between current alternative wage rates and expected
future contract wage rates.

This paper presents an empirical analysis of the potential links
between wage rates and employment for mechanics in the domestic airline

industry. The data consist of quarterly observations on employment,
output and wages for seven major airlines, drawn from the period prior

to deregulation of the industry. Wage rate information is taken from
union contracts covering mechanics at each of the seven airlines, while
employment and output data are taken from Civil Aeronautics Board
records.

The first section of the paper presents a preliminary analysis of

the data using unrestricted vector-autoregressions. The analysis
reveals a striking similarity between the serial correlation properties

—3—

of these micro—level data, and the properties of more familiar aggregate

data. The analysis also shows that aggregate manufacturing wage rates
are an important determinant of both employment levels and wage rates

for airline mechanics. On the assumption that the manufacturing wage
rate represents the alternative wage rate for airline mechanics, the
observed link between mechanics' employment and manufacturing wages can
be attributed either to efficient contracting considerations, or to the
fact that manufacturing wages help predict future contract wage rates,
or both.

The second section of the paper presents a simple intertemporal
contracting model in which it is possible to disentangle these two

effects. The model assumes that employment and wages are selected to
minimize the cost of aircraft maintenance, subject to a utility

constraint for mechanics. Adjustment costs are introduced on the firm's
side to generate an employment function with serial persistence and gra-

dual adjustment to output shocks. Two specifications of workers' preferences are presented that yield alternative expressions for the shadow

value of labor in an optimal contract. The traditional labor demand
model and the strong form efficient contracting model are obtained as
special cases of the general model.

The model yields a partial-adjustment employment equation that

expresses current employment in terms of lagged employment, lagged

departures and lagged wage rates. The model generates testible restrictions across the employment equation and the forecasting equations for
output and wages, and summarizes the employment effect of alternative

—4—

wage rates in terms of two components: a direct effect on the desired
level of employment; and on indirect effect on forecasts of future
contract wages.

The third section of the paper presents the results of fitting the
model to data on departures, wages, and employment for the seven airline

firms. The empirical analysis is generally unsupportive of either the
strong form efficient contracting model or the labor demand model. Both
models are rejected in favor of a more general contracting model in
which the opportunity cost of employment is a weighted average of the

contract wage and the alternative wage. The parameter estimates for all
three models are poorly determined, however, and the implied reduced
forms fail to reconcile all the dynamic linkages between contract wages,
alternative wages, and employment.

I.

Preliminary Data Analysis

The data in this paper consist of quarterly observations on
employment and wages for aircraft mechanics employed in the domestic

operations of seven airlines: American, Braniff, Continental, Eastern,
Trans World, United, and Western.-'' Employment, earnings, and flight
data were collected from various Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) sources

for the period 1969—I to l976—IV." Wage rates were collected from
union contracts summarized in Current Wage Developments and the Bureau

of National Affairs' Daily Labor Report.
Mechanics at these airlines are represented by three unions:
the Transport Workers Union (TWU) at American; the Teamsters (181) at

—5—

Western; and the Machinists (IAN) at the other five airlines. Although
the LAM bargained individually with these five airlines during the
sample period, contract terms and expiration dates differed little bet—

ween them. Differences among the lAM contracts were due mainly to
delays in signing new contracts at the individual airlines.1''

Table 1 presents annual data on nominal and real wage rates for

airline mechanics at the various firms between 1969 and l976. There
were only small and unsystematic differences between wage rates nego-

tiated by the three unions. Compared to other workers, however, airline
mechanics earned relatively high wage rates during this period: 50 to
60 percent higher than average straight-time hourly earnings in manufacturing, for example, and about 25 percent higher than average hourly

earnings reported by maintenance mechanics in manufacturing. Airline
mechanics also earned a small premium (5 to 15 percent) over unionized
mechanics at the major aircraft companies.

Airline mechanics' nominal wage rates are established in two or
three year contracts that typically include both noncontingent deferred

increases and cost—of—living allowance clauses. During the sample
period new agreements were negotiated in 1969 (from March to December,
depending on airline), 1971-72 (from May 1971 to December 1972), 1973—74
(from November 1973 to August 1974), and 1975—76 (from December 1975 to

September 1976). Because of deferred increases and cost-of—living
adjustments, however, the relation between contract negotiations and

real wage rates is indirect. Real wage rates increased over the term of
the 1969 contracts, for example, but were more or less constant between

-6-

1973 and 1976.

The behavior of real contract wage rates is analyzed more formally

in Table 2. Column (1) presents a simple second—order autoregression
(AR(2)) fit jointly to the logarithms of contract wage rates for all

seven airlines, with unrestricted constants, trends and seasonal dummy

variables for each air1ine.-" As is apparently true for aggregate real
wage rates, the contract wage for airline mechanics is approximately a
first—order autoregressive process, with something less than a unit

autoregressive coefficient.—" For purposes of comparison with the
results from a longer sample period, column (6) of the Table presents
the same representation of contract wage rates fit to an extended sample

period (1964 to 1978). The addition of seven extra years of data has no
appreciable impact on the estimated coefficients, however.

The second, third and fourth columns of Table 2 contain estimates
of real wage regressions that include lagged values of manufacturing

wages and consumer prices. Each of these two aggregate series has
strong causual links to contract wages. The point estimates in column
(2) show that a permanent one percent increase in manufacturing wages
leads to an eventual increase in contract wages on the order of one percent, while the estimates in column (3) suggest that a permanent
increase in prices leads to a permanent decrease in contract wages.

In

column (4) of Table 2, both prices and manufacturing wages are entered

in the regression for contract wages. Although the statistical significance of the individual coefficients is mixed, a test that lagged consumer prices improve the forecast of contract wages, given lagged

—7—

manufacturing wages, is marginally significant, while a test for lagged
manufacturing wages, given lagged prices, is not quite significant at

conventional levels. Parallel results for the longer sample period (in
columns (7), (8), and (9)) lead to very similar conclusions.

Finally, column (5) of Table 2 reports the coefficients of lagged

employment in forecasting contract wages. The point estimate suggest
that increases in employment lead to small increases in real contract
wages, although a test of the hypothesis that employment fails to
Granger-cause wages is not significant at conventional levels.11''
The general pattern of employment for airline mechanics is illustrated in Figure 1, which gives a time—series plot of departures and

employment at American Airlines. In addition to mechanics' employment,
the figure shows quarterly employment levels for pilots and flight

attendants. One of the most interesting features of the data is the
extent to which employment of these three groups of workers is smoothed

vis-a—vis departures. At one extreme, the number of employed pilots is
very stable and shows little relation to output. At the other, the
number of flight attendants is quite variable over time. Mechanics fall
somewhere between these two groups. Fluctuations in departures
translate into dampened fluctuations in the number of employed
mechanics.

Data on flying operations and mechanics' employment are summarized
by airline in Table 3. The airlines fall naturally into two groups:
the four largest firms——American, Eastern, Trans World and United, and the

three smaller firms. Interestingly, the number of mechanics per unit of

—8—

output is quite different between the larger and smaller airlines.
Relative to the employment levels at the smaller airlines, the larger
airlines have 60 to 70 percent more maintenance employees per departure

(or per available seat mile). To some extent this may reflect a greater
reliance on outside contractors to perform specialized maintenance

operations at the smaller airlines. Smoothing of employment relative to
departures is indicated by the smaller coefficient of variation of

employment for all the airlines except Continental and United. A
similar conclusion emerges from a comparison between detrended and

deseasonalized employment and departures. With the exception of United
Airlines, the standard deviation of the logarithm of employment is about
two-thirds as large as the standard deviation of the logarithm of departures, when both series have been fitted to a linear trend and quarterly
dummy variables.

Table 4 presents a more formal analysis of employment variability

and its relation to departures and wages. The first column of the Table
presents a simple AR(2) specification of employment, fit jointly to the
seven airlines with firm—specific trends, constants, and seasonals.

Employment of airline mechanics displays the hump—shaped moving average
representation that characterizes many aggregate employment time
series.i_?1 The response to a unit innovation in employment persists

for roughly 10 quarters. As one might expect from Table 3, there is
some heterogeneity across the airlines in the autoregressive representation of employment, particularly between United and the other six

carriers. An F—test that the coefficients are the same across the seven

—9—

airlines yields a probability value of just under .001.

Column (2) of Table 4 presents the coefficients of two lagged
values of departures in explaining maintenance employment at the seven

airlines. The coefficients are individually significant at conventional
levels, although their joint contribution, summarized by the probability

value in row 9c of the Table, is only marginally significant. The third
and fourth columns of Table 4 examine the role of lagged contract wages

and lagged manufacturing wages in predicting employment. The evidence
that contract wages Influence employment Is relatively weak, although

the evidence for manufacturing wages is stronger. Finally, the fifth
column of the Table includes both wage measures together.

In. this

equation increases In contract wages have a significantly negative
effect on employment, whereas increases in manufacturing wages lead to

an eventual increase in emp1oyment.The results in column (5) are apparently robust to several alter-

native definitions of the opportunity wage for airline mechanics. In
particular, if the manufacturing wage is replaced by the average wage of
maintenance mechanics in manufacturing (interpolated from annual BLS

Area Wage Survey data) or the wage rate for licensed mechanics at Boeing
(available from the BLS wage chronology series) the coefficients are
very similar in size and magnitude to those in Table 4, although less
precisely estimated.

I also constructed airline—specific measures of

the opportunity wage based on earnings of maintenance mechanics and
unemployment rates in cities where each airline has its major main-

tenance base)" These alternative wage measures give the same pattern

-10—

of results as the manufacturing wage rate, although each can be rejected
as a significant determinant of maintenance employment after controlling

for the manufacturing wage rate. In this paper I therefore use the
manufacturing wage as the alternative wage rate for airline mechanics.
Table 5 examines the contribution of several additional explanatory

variables for maintenance employment. In each case, the employment
equation contains two lagged values of the explanatory variable listed
in the column heading, together with lagged values of employment, depar-

tures, contract wages, and manufacturing wages. The first four columns
present employment equations that include alternative aggregate

variables: consumer prices, real national income, an index of
CAB-regulated passenger fares, a jet fuel price index, and an index of

parts prices. None of these variables significantly improves the predicition of employment, maintaining lagged departures and wage rates. The
next five columns of the Table report employment regressions that

include additional airline—specific measures of output: available seat
miles, revenue—passenger miles, domestic flight hours, and total flight

hours (including domestic and international flight hours). Apart from

available seat miles, however, none of these output measures is an
important determinant of employment, once the level of departures is

taken into account. Departures and available seat miles are highly
colinear, and the sums of the coefficients on departures and seat miles
are very nearly equal to the corresponding coefficients of departures

when seat miles are excluded from the regression. Since the coefficients of the other variables are not much affected by the presence or

—11—

absence of seat miles in the employment equation, I use departures as
the sole measure of airline output in the remainder of the paper.
Finally, while the results are not recorded in the table, I have also
computed employment regressions that include airline-specific fleet com-

position variables.1' Although these measures of firm—specific capital
stock are marginally significant determinants of employment, their
inclusion has no effect on the nature of the results in Table 4 or 5.
The analysis of employment in Tables 4 and 5 is restricted to the

number of mechanics on airline payrolls in each quarter. A more
complete description of labor inputs, however, requires information on

hours per employed worker. Although CAB records do not include any
measure of hours per worker, a noisy indicator of hours is available

from data on average payroll cost per worker. Specifically, the ratio
of payroll cost per worker to the contract wage rate represents the sum
of straight time hours per worker, average overtime hours per worker
(weighted by the overtime wage premium) and fringe benefit costs per

worker (expressed as a fraction of the straight time wage rate).- A
regression of this hours index on contemporaneous employment and depar-

tures reveals no significant correlation with either variab1e)V This
absence of correlation suggests that measured hours variation can be
safely ignored in the study of employment and output.
The interpretation of employment equations that include lagged output variables, such as those in Tables 4 and 5, depends critically on

the time—series representation of output. Table 6 presents several
alternative representations of the level of departures activity at the

—12—

seven airline firms. In each case the logarithm of departures is
regressed on two lagged values of departures and two lagged values of

the explanatory variable listed in the column heading. The coefficient
estimates of a univariate forecasting equation (in the first column of
the Table) show that departures have a monotonically declining movingaverage representation, rather than the hump—shaped representation that

characterizes employment. The second column presents the coefficients
of lagged employment in a forecasting equation for departures, as well

as the probability value of the associated exclusion test. The hypothesis that departures are exogenous to maintenance employment is not

rejected at conventional significance levels. The remaining columns of
Table 6 present the coefficients of three alternative aggregate

variables in the departures equations: real output, manufacturing
wages, and consumer prices. None of these is significantly related to
departures activity, however, controlling for lagged departures.
To conclude this preliminary data analysis, the main conclusions
may be summarized as follows:

(1) the serial correlation properties of firm—specific employment
and wage data for airline mechanics are very similar to the
properties of aggregate data. Airline mechanics' real wage
rates follow a first-order autoregressive process, while their
employment levels follow a second—order process.
(2)

in the period under study wage rates of airline mechanics were
very similar across firms and uncorrelated with firm—specific
employment levels. Real wage rates were significantly correlated with lagged manufacturing wage rates and lagged consumer
prices.

(3) Employment of airline mechanics is correlated with lagged
values of contract wage rates and lagged values of wage rates
outside the airline sector. The separate effects of these two
wage rates are well—determined and in opposite directions.
The employment effect of outside wage rates is apparently

—13—

robust to alternative definitions of the outside wage,
although average hourly earnings in manufacturing has the
strongest correlation with employment of airline mechanics.

Building on these conclusions, the next section presents an intertem—
poral contracting model that provides a framework for testing between
alternative models of the link between wage rates and employment.

II. Contractual Employment with Costly Adjustment
This section presents a simple extention of the static efficient

contracting model to an intertemporal setting. Adjustment costs are
introduced on the firm's side in order to generate an employment function with serial persistence and cumulative rather than instantaneous

responses to changes In output or wages. The resulting function
expresses optimal employment in terms of lagged values of employment,

output, and wages, and provides a convenient framework for testing

alternative models of employment determination. Both the labor demand
model of employment determination, in which the employer takes contract
wages as given, and the strong—form efficiency model, in which the
marginal product of labor is equated to the alternative wage rate, are
obtained as special cases of the model.

In contrast to tests of the

efficient contract hypothesis based on a static employment function, the
time series correlations of employment and wages are modelled explicitly,
and used to disentangle the forecasting role of alternative wages from
any efficient contracting effects.

For simplicity, the dynamic relationship between output, wages, and
employment is assumed to arise solely from the demand side of the

—14—

contract. Workers are modelled as having separable preferences over
time, with no interaction between lagged values of wages or employment

and the ranking of current wage—employment pairs. While this assumption
simplifies the analysis and interpretation of the dynamic employment
function, it restricts the role of lagged wages and employment in
generating current employment, and represents an obvious channel for

further research.'
The first step in specifying the contractual employment function
for airline mechanics is to specify the link between flight activity,

maintenance activity, and employment. Airline mechanics service and
inspect aircraft between departures ('line service") and also rebuild

and overhaul aircraft components at major service intervals.1' In
either case a variety of substitutes is available for in-house mechanics' services, including outside subcontractors and purchases of new
parts and equipment. In addition', airlines can substitute mechanics'

services over time by adding to or running down the stock of airworthy

equipment. For simplicity, however, I assume that a given level of

flight activity in the tth quarter, Ft ,

I also assume that that maintenance is

produced by a combination of in-house employment Nt and other inputs

In addition to these direct costs, I assume that the firm bears an

adjustment cost J(Nt. Nt_i) in period t that depends on the level of

employment in t and t—l

This adjustment cost captures both hiring

and firing costs, and the cost of rearranging flight schedu]es as the
number of employees available for line service at each airport is
adjusted over time.

The final ingredient of the employment contract is the specifica-

tion of worker& preferences. I assume that preferences in each period
are represented by a function of contract wages, employment, outside or

alternative wages at , and a random preference shock

U(N, w, at,

.

Two functional forms are considered for U

In the first case, assume that N0 workers are attached to the firm,
and that workers are allocated randomly in each period between contract

employment and alternative employment with probabilities Nt/NO and

1—Nt/N0 respectively. If v(x, v) is a von-Neumann—Morgenstern

directly, subject to the forecasting equations for flight activity,

input prices, and contract wages. A comparison of equations (5) and (6)
reveals two important differences between the efficient contract and

labor demand models. First, the efficient contract model treats wages
and employment as jointly endogenous. Second, while alternative wages
enter the contracting model directly through workers' preferences, in
the labor demand model the only role of alternative wages is in the
forecasting equation for future contract wages.

Before deriving the employment functions associated with the
contracting and labor demand models it is useful to characterize the

wage function implied by the efficient contracting model. In particular, it is interesting to ask if a contracting model which considers

-18—

wages and employment as jointly determined can even lead to the prediction that wage outcomes are independent of previous employment levels.

The empirical analysis in the first section of this paper suggests that
this is an important characteristic of contract wage rates for airline
mechanics.

The first—order condition for wages in period t*j for the
contracting model (5) is:

(7) Nt+j —

i U(Nt+

at+ t+j =

From this equation it is evident that the choice of contract wages in
t+j is independent of employment if workers' preferences are linear in

employment: say

U(N, w, a, ') =

Nf(w, a, v)

In that case the first—order condition (7) has the simple form

w"t-+-j at÷ vt÷) =

1

with the implication that contract wages are determined in each period

independent of employment or wage choices in any other period. Since
the evidence in the previous section suggests that contract wages are
unrelated to past employment, the assumption that workers' preferences
are linear in employment is plausible as well as convenient, and will be

adopted here. The expected—utility preference specification (3) imposes

linearity a prlori.-" For the Cobb—Douglas specification (4),
linearity implies a within—period objective of the form Nt(wt—at)8

-19—

where e = 82 > 0

may be either greater than or less than unity.

Specializing the first—order condition (7) to these two preference
specifications leads to

implies that real contract wages are constant over time, apart from

changes in the preference shock U or random measurement errors. The
Cobb—Douglas specification,on the other hand, suggests that contract
wages maintain a constant (absolute) differential over alternative

wages. For example, if k(ut) =

with the fitted regressions in the first section of this paper suggests
that the first—order condition (8b) may provide a useful model of the
contract wage determination process for airline mechanics.

The assuptlon that worker's preferences over employment and wage
outcomes are linear in employment simplifies the analysis of contractual

employment setting. Let w÷ represent the solution to equation (8a)

subject to the forecasting equations for flight activity, alternative

wages, preference shocks, and optimized contract wages.-" If
employment fails to Granger—cause wages, the contract employment

function can be obtained by taking the contract wage as exogenous. In
this case the labor demand model of employment determination (6) is a

special case of the contracting model (9) with JAO
In order to derive the contract employment function when there
are costs of changing employment from period to period it is convenient to

procede in two steps. The first step is to derive the optimal
employment level in the absence of adjustment costs. The second step is
to derive the actual employment decision by comparing the costs of
changing employment over time with the cost of sub— or super—optimal

employment in each period." For simplicity these two cost components
are expressed as quadratic functions of the logarithm of employment,
yielding an employment function that is linear in the logarithms of
employment, output, and wages.

The optimal employment choice in the absence of adjustment cost can
be obtained from the first-order condition for the contracting problem
(9), setting the adjustment cost component to zero:

For the expected utility specification of workers preferences, this

where for simplicity I have suppressed the dependence of v on the preference shock

The term on the left-hand side of this equation

represents the marginal value product of labor, measured by the savings

in noniabor input costs as employment is increased by one unit. The
marginal value product of labor is equated to the current contract wage,

minus a premium that depends on the gap between contract and alternative

wages. Using the properties of the optimal contract wage (equation
(8a)), the appropriate shadow value of mechanics' labor is

If the expected utility function v is linear in earnings, then the

the shadow value of labor in the absence of

have the expected utlitly form, the shadow value of labor in an optimal

contract is decreasing in the contract wage. As noted by McDonald and
Solow (1981), this specification of worker preferences implies that
efficient combinations of employment and wages are positively correlated
across otherwise identical contracts.

to derive the optimal level of employment in period t

expected future values of log Ft ,

log w , log

These expressions can in turn be written as functions of current and
past values of wages and departures, and current and past values of all
variables useful in predicting wages or departures.

The presence of unobserved error components in the static employment function (13) introduces an additional consideration into the

formulation of the dynamic employment function. Suppose that equation
(13) contains a stochastic productivity effect

Then, excluding

activity, employment or wages. Then

E £t4j = l—A$p

which introduces a first—order autoregressive error into the dynamic
employment function (16), and generates a second—order autoregressive
representation of employment.

The terms on the right—hand side of equation (16) depend on the
definitions and forecasting equations for alternative wages, flight

activity, nonlabor input prices, and contract wages. On the basis of
the evidence reported in Section 1, I assume that the alternative wage
for airline mechanics is represented by the average hourly wage rate in

manufacturing (apart from trend and seasonal factors). As a measure of
flight activity I use the level of domestic departures. Finally, for

lack of suitable data, I assume that nonlabor input prices ()

are

captured by trend and seasonal factors. This assumption is especially
problematic if the main substitute for in—house employment is contract
maintenance, and if the price of contract maintenance is correlated with
mechanics' wage rates.

—27—

Building on the results in Section 1 I adopt the following second—
order autoregressive forecasting system for detrended and deseasonalized
departures, manufacturing wages, contract wages, and consumer prices:

(17a) log Ft =

log Ft_i +

log at._i

it4 log a_2 ÷ u4.

where the vector of residuals (uit, 112t' u3, u4t) is assumed to be
serially uncorrelated.

In this forecasting system aggregate prices and

manufacturing wages depend on their own lagged values and lagged values
of each other, while departures are forecast by a univariate second-

order autoregression. Contract wages depend on their own lagged values
as well as lagged values of manufacturing wages and consumer prices.
The forecasting equation for contract wages can be interpreted as a log—
linear approximation to the first—order condition (7) for optimal
contract wages, although I do not restrict the coefficients of the

equation in any way. The evidence that alternative wages help forecast
contract wages is more consistent with the Cobb—Douglas preference specification than the expected utility specification, although neither

-28-

model provides a ready interpretation of the role of prices in forecasting contract wage

rates.'

The system of second—order forecasting equations (17) generate the
following expressions:

(iSa) (l-X$) I(A)3 Et log Ft+ =

B35 log Pt + B36 log

log w + B32 log w_1

where the B are known functions of the coefficients in equations
(17a)-(17d). Substituting these equations into (16), performing a
transformation to eliminate serial correlation in the productivity shock
and using (17a)—(17d) to substitute for current values of departures, prices and wages in terms of lagged values and innovations in
these variables yields the reduced form employment equation implied by

the model. This reduced form contains two lagged values of employment,
and each of the exogenous variables (including contract wages), as well
as a residual that is a combination of the unanticipated productivity
shock

and the current forecast errors u1, u2, u3, and u4

The

coefficients of the reduced form equation depend on the coefficients of

equations (16) and (18), the adjustment parameter A , and the serial

correlation coefficient p of the unobserved productivity shock.2"

-29-

The dynamic properties of employment, however, depend solely on A and
p .

The first—order autoregressive coefficient of employment is the sum

of A and p ,

while

the second—order autoregressive coefficient is the

negative of their product.

To illustrate the implications of the model for the reduced form
employment equation, it is useful to consider the two polar models of

employment determination: the labor demand model in which the relevant
opportunity cost of contract labor is the contract wage; and the strong—
form efficient contract model in which the relevant opportunity cost is

the alternative wage rate. In the labor demand model b3 = 0

in

equation (16) and the alternative wage effects employment only through

the forecasting equation for contract wages. If future contract wages
depend positively on manufacturing wages, for example, then employment
should depend negatively on manufacturing wages, at least in the long

run. The evidence in Tables 2 and 4, however, shows that manufacturing
wages have a positive long—run impact on contract wages, and a positive

long—run effect on employment. In the strong—form efficient contract,
on the other hand,

is independent of contract wages and depends

only on the level of alternative wages. This model is also rejected by
the unrestricted employment regressions in Table 4, which show a nega—
tive impact of contract wages on employment, holding constant manufac-

turing wages. More formal tests between these two polar models, and
tests of the overidentifying restrictions implied by the general
contracting model, are presented in the next section.

III. Empirical Analysis of the Dynamic Contracting Model
The model of employment determination developed in the last section

-30—

consists of the prediction equations for contract wages, alternative
wages and departures (equations (17a)—(17d)), together with the reduced

form employment equation implied by (16). This section presents estimation results based on fitting this five equation system to aggregate
quarterly data on manufacturing wages and consumer prices as well as
firm—specific data on contract wages, employment, and departures for the

seven airline firms. For simplicity, the firm—specific data are

deseasonalized and detrended prior to estimation. This permits
unrestricted airline—specific constants, trends, and seasonals to be
fitted outside of the main estimation step, at the cost of some potential bias in the estimated standard errors.

In addition, rather than estimate equations for the airline—
specific data and the aggregate data simultaneously, I have estimated
the manufacturing wage and consumer price equations separately over a
longer sample period (1964 111—1978 IV), and then used the estimated
parameters as known constants in the calculation of the restricted

employment equation. The model is therefore treated as a three—equation
system for employment, wages, and departures, with known forecasting
equations for aggregate wages and prices.

The employment, wage, and departures equations for each of the seven
airline firms (21 equations in all) are fitted to detrended and deseaso—
nalized data by a two—step nonlinear generalized least-squares proce-

dure.?" The age estimates minimize the weighted residuals of the 21
equation system, using as weights the inverse covariance matrix formed

by the unrestricted least—squares residuals. Following Gallant and

-31—

Jorgenson (1979), a goodness-of-fit test is constructed by comparing the
weighted sum of squares of the restricted model to the weighted sum of
squares of the unrestricted model.

Unrestricted vector—autoregressive representations of airline—
specific departures, wages, and employment are presented in the first

two columns of Table 71" The first column contains estimates of the
three—equation system when lagged prices are excluded from the wage and
employment equations, while the second column contains estimates of the

system when lagged prices are included in these two equations. The
coefficient estimates are very similar to the corresponding estimates in
Tables 2, 4, and 6 obtained by fitting the system equation-by-equation
to unadjusted data.

The next two columns of Table 7 contain the restricted reduced form
parameter estimates associated with the labor demand version of equation

(16). The corresponding structural parameter estimates are presented in
the first two columns of Table 8.

In this version of the contracting

model, the appropriate opportunity cost of labor is the contract wage
rate, and manufacturing wages enter the employment equation for airline
mechanics only in so far as they help to predict future contract wages.
The model is therefore an application of Sargents' (1978) dynamic
employment demand model to firm-specific data, with output taken as exo-

genous. The two alternative specfications of the labor-demand model
differ by whether or not lagged prices are used to forecast future

contract wages and future alternative wages."
The estimated wage elasticities (the parameter b2) for the labor

-32—

demand model are small and positive, and insignificantly different from

zero. A comparison of the restricted reduced forms in columns (3) and
(4) with the unrestricted reduced forms in columns (1) and (2) suggests

several difficulties with the restricted fit. First, the labor demand
model cannot explain the opposite signs of contract and manufacturing
wages in the reduced form employment equation, given that future
contract wages are positively correlated with manufacturing wages.
Second, in the specification of the model that includes prices in the
forecasting equation for contract wages, the relatively small effects of
prices on employment are difficult to reconcile with the relatively

large effects of prices on expected future contract wages. The
goodness—of—fit statistics in the last row of Table 8 suggest that the
labor demand interpretation of the employment-wage—output system is
strongly rejected by the data.

In contrast to the poor performance of the model in summarizing the
effects of wages on employment, the linkage between departures and

employment is more successfully explained. The estimated (long—run)
output elasticity of employment is between .60 and .80 and is not signi-

ficantly different from unity. The AR(2) structure of employment is
also apparently well-captured by th combination of adjustment costs and

first—order serial correlation in demand: a comparison of the
restricted and unrestricted reduced form autoregressive parameters
reveals only small differences between them.

Parameter estimates for the strong form efficient contract model,
which takes the alternative wage rate as the opportunity cost of labor

—33—

and excludes contract wage rates from the employment equation, are presented in columns (3) and (4) of Table 8. The associated reduced forms

are contained in the fifth and sixth columns of Table 7. Again, a comparison of the unrestricted and restricted reduced forms shows that the
model has trouble explaining the effects of manufacturing wages on

employment. When prices are not used to forecast future manufacturing
wage rates, the implied estimate of the elasticity of demand is .29.
When prices are included in the wage forecasting equation, on the other

hand, the estimated elasticity of demand is —.05. As Is the case for
the labor demand model of employment determination, the dynamic link
between wages and employment is not well explained by the strong form
efficient contract model, although the departures—employment relationship is reasonably well explained by either model.

Finally, estimates of a general contracting model that permits the
shadow value of labor to depend on a weighted average of contract and
alternative wages are presented in the last columns of Table 7 and Table
8.

In this general model, prices are included in the forecasting

equations for contract wages and manufacturing wages. A version of the
model that excluded prices from the wage equations proved to be

unidentified.V Although the general contracting model fits better
than either polar model, the estimated wage elasticities of employment

are poorly determined and not significantly different from zero. Again,
the implied reduced—form coefficients of contract and manufacturing
wages in the employment equation are different from the unrestricted
coefficients, and the goodness—of-fit test against the unrestricted

-34—

model is highly significant.

The point estimates imply that mechanics' employment responds nega—
tively to increases in their alternative wage rate, as measured by the
manufacturing wage rate, and positively to increases in their contrac-

tual wage rate. The latter effect, which may be taken as weak evidence
for a positive correlation between contract wages and employment, is
consistent with either the expected utility preference specification (2)
and some degree of risk aversion, or the Cobb—Douglas specification (3)

with 8 <

and i = .—64

although the estimates are extremely imprecise and

insignificantly different from zero. For the expected utility specifi-

cation of workers' preferences, the coefficient -a represents the product of the relative risk aversion coefficient (5) and the average

If

the latter is

about .25, the implied estimate of the relative risk aversion coef-

ficient is about 2.4. For the Cobb—Douglas preference specification

the coefficient a is an estimate of

The implied value of 0

is .63. These estimates are not unreasonable, although their imprecision is
disturbing, as is the failure of the reduced form of the model to
reproduce the unrestricted reduced form of the data.

—35—

Overall, none of the models considered in this paper gives a particularly good fit to the data, particularly with respect to the coef-

ficients of contract or manufacturing wages. In addition, the fact that
real contract wage rates and real manufacturing wage rates are both
heavily influenced by lagged consumer prices is not easi1y reconciled

with the absence of price effects on employment." A more flexible
model of the interactions between contract and alternative wage rates,

on one hand, and employment, on the other, is apparently needed to
describe the data.

IV. Conclusions
This paper presents an analysis of firm-specific employment and
wage outcomes for airline mechanics at seven firms during the period
1969-1976.

The data possess many of the familiar properties of aggre-

gate wage and employment data, including second-order serial correlation

in employment and first—order serial correlation in real wages. Airline
mechanics' employment levels are found to be correlated with both their
own wage rates, and with average wage rates outside the airline
industry.

A theoretical model is presented that describes the evolution of
wages and employment in several alternative settings, including the tra—
ditional labor demand setting, where firms take contract wages as exoge-

nous, and an efficient contract setting, where wages and employment are
jointly determined to minimize employer costs, subject to a utility

requirement for workers. The model incorporates costly adjustment of

-36--

employment over time and emphasizes that workers' alternative wages can

have two effects on employment outcomes: a direct effect on the shadow
value of worker's time, and an indirect effect on forecasts of future
wage outcomes.

The model gives a straightforward and relatively successful
interpretation of the empirical link between airline departures and

mechanics employment. None of the alternative versions of the model.,
however, successfully captures the links between wages and employment.
Both the labor demand model and the simplest efficient contracting
model, which equates the marginal product of workers to their alternative wage rate, are rejected in favor of a more general model that

includes contract and alternative wages in the employment equation. The
parameter estimates for this model, however, are extremely imprecise,
and the implied reduced-form employment equation fits poorly relative to

an unrestricted autoregression. In spite of the promise that simple
contracting models might provide a credible interpretation of observed
movements in employment and wages, the covariation of employment and
wages in this data remains largely unexplained.

high level of strike activity at National and Northwest, these airlines

were excluded from the present study. PanAm differs from the domestic
trunks in that a large share of its business is international. For this
reason, domestic employment data for PanAm may be misleading, and I chose

to exclude It. Deltats mechanics are nonunionized, and as a result no
direct measure of contract wage rates is available.

'Detailed quarterly employment data is unavailable after 1976.
Employment and payroll information pertain to maintenance and related

workers, as defined by the CAB. This group includes aircraft inspectors
and mechanics, as well as cleaners, janitors, and stock clerks.

According to CAB records, there were 37,036 maintenance workers in the

domestic trunk airlines in the third quarter of 1975. A Bureau of Labor
Statistics Industry Wage Survey during August-November 1975 counted
29,518 inspectors and mechanics and 8,588 cleaners, janitors and stock
clerks at the domestic trunks, for a total of 38,106 maintenance and

related workers. On this basis, approximately 80 percent of maintenance
workers are actually airline mechanics or inspectors.

adjusting contract wage rates that is missing from the model.

also be estimated by applying instrumental variables techniques to the

first—order condition for contract employment. The instrumental

variables procedure has the advantage that closed—form solutions for
•the optimal employment choice are not required. The explicit solution
procedure adopted here, on the other hand, has the advantage of offering
a direct interpretation of the reduced—form system for departures,
wages, and employment.

"These unrestricted representations incorporate a variety of
exclusion restrictions (for example, lagged employment is not included

in the departures equation). Conditional on these exclusion restrictions, however, the estimates are unrestricted.

Equation (8) can be written as

Then

(l—x) jO (X)3 Et log Ft+ e'(1—X) j0

with

similar expressions for the forward-moving averages of contract

wages and manufacturing wages. Provided that the characteristic roots

of A are smaller than (X) in modulus, the infinite sum

converges. Assuming this to be true, let

According to equation (7),

Regressions include constants, linear trends, and quarterly dummy variables. Coefficients (except
constants, trends, and seasonals) are restricted to be equal across airlines. Contract wages and
manufacturing wages are deflated by the Consumer Price Index. Regressions contain airline—specific
dummy variables for strike and immediate post-strike observations.

Notes: "See notes to Table 7. Estimates in columns (1) and (3) are based on
a forecasting equation for contract wages that excludes consumer
prices. Estimates in columns (2), (4). and (5) are based on a
forecasting equation for contract wages that includes manufacturing
wages and consumer prices. Estimates are conditional on parameter
estimates for consumer price and manufacturing wage equations.
