ABSTRACT
The literature on skill formation and human capital development clearly demonstrates that early investment
in children is an equitable and efficient policy with large returns in adulthood. Yet little is known
about the mechanisms involved in producing these long-term effects. This paper presents early evidence
on the nature of skill formation based on an experimentally designed, five-year home visiting program
in Ireland targeting disadvantaged families - Preparing for Life (PFL). We examine the impact of investment
between utero to 18 months of age on a range of parental and child outcomes. Using the methodology
of Heckman et al. (2010a), permutation testing methods and a stepdown procedure are applied to account
for the small sample size and the increased likelihood of false discoveries when examining multiple
outcomes. The results show that the program impact is concentrated on parental behaviors and the
home environment, with little impact on child development at this early stage. This indicates that home
visiting programs can be effective at offsetting deficits in parenting skills within a relatively short
timeframe, yet continued investment may be required to observe direct effects on child development.
While correcting for attrition bias leads to some changes in the precision of estimates, overall the results
are quite similar.

Introduction

Investment in early childhood is increasingly recognized as a key policy mechanism for
ameliorating social disadvantage. Evidence from the few experimentally designed programs,
implemented in childhood but with long term follow-up, suggests positive effects into
adulthood across multiple domains, including fewer behavioral problems and criminal
convictions, lower dependency on welfare, and increased employment (Olds et al., 1998;
Heckman et al., 2010b). Cunha and Heckman (2007) present a model of skill formation
demonstrating that early skills facilitate the accumulation of more advanced skills, and these
higher levels of skills, early in life, make further investment throughout the lifecycle more
productive through a process of dynamic complementarity. These processes form the
theoretical basis of why early investment generates high returns in adulthood, yet little is
known about the mechanisms involved in producing these long-term effects.
In this paper we present evidence on the nature of skill formation in the early years
based on an experimentally designed, home visiting program in Ireland targeting
disadvantaged families known as Preparing for Life (PFL). The program begins in utero and
continues until age 5 and thus has the potential to influence skill formation during a period
when brain development is at its most malleable (Nelson, 2000; Knudsen et al., 2006). Based
on a rich and extensive data set including both child and parental outcomes, we investigate the
early impact of the program on participating families. This allows us to determine whether
treatment effects from targeted intervention programs manifest early in the lifecycle, and to
identify the mechanisms involved in generating this process.
Using the methodology of Romano and Wolf (2005) and Heckman et al. (2010a), we
apply permutation testing and a stepdown procedure to account for the small sample size and
the increased likelihood of false discoveries when examining multiple outcomes. This is

1

important as adopting a naive evaluation strategy (which examines each outcome individually,
and calculates the proportion of outcomes for which a significant difference is found) would
result in a higher number of significant treatment effects than a more conservative approach
that accounts for the testing of multiple hypotheses simultaneously.
Specifically, when we adopt a naïve approach we find a significant effect for 25
percent of outcomes (6/24) at six months, 7 percent of outcomes (1/14) at 12 months, and 16
percent of outcomes (5/30) at 18 months. While this could be interpreted as an overall
positive program effect, when a more rigorous method is applied, where the p-values are
adjusted to account for the increased likelihood of a Type I error in a multiple hypotheses
setting, we find significantly fewer program effects. The results using this more rigorous
approach indicate that the program effects are concentrated on parenting outcomes, while the
joint null hypothesis of no effect on child development outcomes fails to be rejected at six, 12
and 18 months.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the early years findings from
studies of other home visiting programs on child development and parenting. Section 3
describes the PFL program and experimental design, including a description of the
recruitment and randomization procedure and the data used in our analysis. We present the
econometric framework in Section 4. The results are provided in Section 5 and Section 6
concludes.

Comparison with Existing Home Visiting Programs

Family-focused approaches to early intervention have become increasingly popular due to a
strong belief that parental outcomes serve a mediating role in child development (BrooksGunn et al. 2000). We document the evidence on the impact of a range of home visiting
programs on child development and parenting outcomes in Table A1 in Appendix A.
2

The

primary source of information for this review was the Home Visiting Evidence of
Effectiveness website (http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov, U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2009)1. We limited our assessment to programs that have conducted followup assessments before and up to 18 months of age.

All programs focus on similar

mechanisms that promote child success: educating parents about child development and child
health, encouraging a healthy lifestyle, affirming maternal perceptions of self-efficacy in the
parenting role, and encouraging positive parenting practices. We also limited our scope to
results from studies that were rated as either ‘High’ (random assignment studies with low
attrition of sample members and no reassignment of sample members after the original
random assignment; and single case and regression discontinuity designs that meet the What
Works Clearinghouse (WWC) design standards) or ‘Moderate’ (random assignment studies
that due to flaws in the study design or analysis (e.g. high sample attrition) do not meet the
criteria for the high rating; matched comparison group designs; and single case and regression
discontinuity designs that meet WWC design standards with reservations). In addition, we
conducted an extensive literature search according to the criteria outlined by HomVee and
added any additional relevant studies.
Overall, there is little evidence among previous studies of a treatment effect on child
development outcomes as early as 18 months. The results for parenting outcomes are more
mixed. Many studies find a positive effect of home visiting programs on the quality of the
home environment up to 18 months (Culp et al. (2004) with the Community-based Family
Resource Service Programs; Wagner et al. (1996) with Parents as Teachers, Black et al.

1

This site was launched by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a thorough and
transparent review of the home visiting research literature and provide an assessment of the evidence of
effectiveness for home visiting program models that target families with pregnant women and children from
birth to age five. Trained reviewers evaluated randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs for
each model and authors were given the opportunity to respond to missing information.

3

(1994) with a home intervention for drug abusing mothers, Mackenzie et al. (2004) with
Starting Well; and Larson (1980) with Pre/Post-Natal Home Visiting).

However, other

studies find no effect of home visiting on the quality of the home environment (MitchellHerzfeld et al. (2005) and Duggan, McFarlane et al. (2005) with Healthy Families America;
Shute and Judge (2005) with Starting Well; and Caughy et al. (2004) with Healthy Steps).
None of these studies have been evaluated using methods that address sample size
limitations. Some studies have the advantage of larger samples (Olds et al. (2002) and
Kitzman et al. (1997) with NFP; Lee et al. (2009) with Health Families America), while
others acknowledge the issue of small samples yet do not adapt their statistical approach
(Jungmann et al. (2009) with Pro Kind and LeCroy and Krysik (2011) with Healthy Families
America). The problems associated with hypothesis testing of multiple outcomes are largely
ignored in this literature with the exception of LeCroy and Krysik (2011) who reduce the
number of outcome variables, and Culp et al. (2004) where multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA) methods are used for two outcome clusters. This study, which addresses these
methodological issues, will thus enhance the home visiting literature.

Preparing for Life – Program Design and Impact Data

3.1

Description of the Intervention

PFL is a five-year program that was developed to address the problems of socioeconomic
disadvantage in a multi-generation, suburban community classified by welfare authorities as
disadvantaged and consisting mainly of low-density welfare provided (or social) housing in
Dublin, Ireland.2 The program was initiated and developed by community representatives and

2

Census data from 2006, before the recent Irish economic crisis, show that 62 percent of residents lived in social
housing (the national average was 9 percent), the unemployment rate was three times the Irish national average
at 12 percent, and just five percent of residents had received postsecondary education while the national average
was 29 percent. (Census 2006).

4

local health and education service providers to improve the documented low levels of school
readiness in the catchment area.3 The intervention begins during pregnancy and will continue
until the child starts school at age 4/5. The program was available to all pregnant women
residing in the community and participation was voluntary. The program is being evaluated
using a randomized control trial (RCT) design in which all families who consented to take
part are randomly assigned to either a low level of treatment or a high level of treatment.
Figure 1 describes the structure of the program.
Figure 1

Program Evaluation Structure – Preparing for Life

Doyle and McNamara (2011) find that children from the catchment community were rated below the applied
norm (Canadian) at school entry by teachers across all five domains on the Short Early Development Instrument
(S-EDI; Janus, Duku, & Stat, 2005). These domains relate to children’s physical health and wellbeing, social
competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive development, communication and general knowledge.
Table B1 in Appendix B presents the results from this analysis.

5

All participating families are provided with developmental toys for each year they are
in the program, facilitated access to preschool in the year before starting school, and are
encouraged to attend public health workshops on stress control and healthy eating. The
participants in the low treatment group also have access to an information officer (to provide,
for example, details about public “services as usual” in the area, such as housing services and
childcare services), yet they may not receive any information on parenting or child
development. Participants in the high treatment group receive the additional provision of a
home visiting service for five years, whereby an assigned mentor visits the home up to once a
week for between 30 minutes and two hours for the duration of the program. The PFL manual
originally prescribed weekly visits, yet the majority of families received fortnightly visits
while some only participated in monthly visits (Doyle, 2013). Thus, PFL is an intention-totreat program as the actual dosage received by each participant may be less than prescribed.
The home visits start in the prenatal period, as soon as the participant joins the program, and
finish when the children enter school at age 4/5.
The home visiting mentors, from various professional backgrounds, act as advisors to
the participating families. They have been trained to support and educate parents about child
development through structured home visits using “Tip Sheets” - colorful handouts succinctly
presenting best-practice information relating to child development which are given to the
participant and serve as an on-going parenting resource4. High treatment families also receive
group parent training using the Triple P Positive Parenting programme (Sanders, MarkieDadds, and Turner, 2003) which begins when the PFL child is two years of age. As this paper
examines child outcomes up to 18 months of age, our comparison of the high and low

4

The Tip Sheets were designed at a reading level of a 12 year-old to make them as accessible as possible. They
are delivered to participants depending on their child's developmental stage and their family's needs. It is
required that all participants must have received the full set of Tip Sheets by the end of the program. Two
examples of the Tip Sheets are presented in Appendix B3.

6

treatment groups will focus solely on the impact of the home visiting component. A full
description of the PFL curriculum is available in Appendix B2 and Doyle (2013) discusses
the PFL program and evaluation design in greater detail.

3.2

PFL Recruitment & Randomization

Recruitment into the PFL program took place between 2008 and 2010. All pregnant women
residing in the PFL study area were eligible to participate regardless of income or family
background. Eligible candidates were identified using hospital records and community
referral. After voluntarily consenting to take part in the program, participants were assigned to
their level of treatment using an unconditional randomization procedure.5 Each participant
had an equal chance of being allocated to the high or low treatment group. A total of 233
pregnant women consented to participate. This represents a recruitment rate of 52 percent
based on public health nurse records on the number of live births in the community during the
recruitment window.

Twenty-two percent of potential participants in the area were not

identified for recruitment and 26 percent indicated that they did not want to participate in the
program.6
To test the validity of the randomization procedure, a baseline survey was
administered to 205 (low = 101; high =104) participants post-randomization, yet before

5

PFL participants were randomised after informed consent was obtained. To ensure randomisation was not
compromised an unconditional probability computerized randomisation procedure was used whereby the
participant pressed a key on a computer which randomly allocated her treatment group assignment. Once
assignment was completed, an automatic email was generated which included the participant’s unique ID
number and assignment condition. This email was automatically sent to the PFL programme manager and the
evaluation manager. This ensures the recruiter had no influence on the treatment assignment given the evidence
that the experimental design in some of the most influential early childhood interventions from the US (such as
the Perry Preschool Program) were compromised (Heckman et al., 2010). If there were any attempts to reassign
participants from one group to another group, by either directly changing the database or repeating the
randomisation procedure, a second email would automatically highlight this intentional subversion.
6
Socio-demographic data for these eligible non-participants are not currently available. However, data collection
on this group is on-going. Specifically, we are conducting direct cognitive assessments with all non-participating
children when they are 4 years old. In addition, participant parents are asked to complete a questionnaire on their
socio-demographics when they were pregnant with the non-participating child and when their current
demographics. This will allow us to determine whether the non-participants differ with respect to their sociodemographics compared to the PFL participants, addressing the selection issue.

and sixteen variables were analyzed using permutation testing (described in detail in Section
4.2) and no significant differences were found between the high treatment and low treatment
groups for 107 (92 percent) of the measures, indicating the randomization process was
successful. Full descriptive tables including all the measures included in the baseline analysis
are available in Appendix C and a more detailed discussion of the baseline analysis is
available in Doyle (2013).

The evaluation collects data at eight points during program implementation: baseline,
six months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, and school entry.
Trained interviewers, who are blinded to the treatment condition, collect data through face-toface interviews conducted primarily in the participant's home using computer-assisted
personal interviewing. This paper uses data from the baseline, six month, 12 month, and 18
month assessments.

7

Note that 19 participants (low=13; high=6) dropped out before the program began, two participants (low= 1;
high=1) miscarried before completing the baseline interview, and seven (low = 3; high = 4) missed the baseline
interview. An analysis of a subset (N=12) of these early program exits suggests they did not differ on age,
education, employment, financial status and support from family and friends, however the sample is too small to
make any formal inference on this group.

Stylized Facts and Participant Profiles

3.3.1 Description of Participants
Table 2 provides baseline descriptive statistics for the estimation sample available at each
outcome wave. 8 The participating mothers were 26 years old on average, and 21 weeks
pregnant when they joined the program. Approximately 40 percent were employed, over 80
percent had a partner, and almost half were first time mothers. A high proportion indicated
that they had a mental health condition (approximately 26 percent). With respect to substance
use, one half of participants smoked during pregnancy, just over a quarter drank alcohol at
some stage during pregnancy, and just 1 percent of respondents indicated that they had used
an illegal drug during pregnancy.
The participants have a low level of formal education compared to the national
average. Approximately 30 percent indicate that their highest level of education was the
Junior Certificate (an Irish statewide examination which is completed at 15 to 16 years of age
following approximately three years of secondary (high) school) or lower, which is
effectively minimum compulsory schooling). This compares with an age-cohort completion
rate of high school for comparable females of 74 percent. Thus, the dropout rates from high
school are almost three times the national average.

Using a more refined measure of

cognitive capacities, the average level of cognitive resources was approximately 82 using the
Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI, Wechsler, 1999), which is below the
lower bound on the expected population average range for this measure of between 85 and
115.
A number of other important psychometric measures are reported at baseline. A
measure of the parent’s ability to interact and form attachment with others was measured
8

Note that although the sample size for the high treatment group is 82 at both six months and 12 months, the
composition of the sample is not identical at each point as individuals who missed a survey at one data collection
point could reengage at later waves.

9

using the Vulnerable Attachment Style Questionnaire (VASQ; Bifulco et al., 2003). A score
above 15 indicates vulnerability for depressive disorders and our sample mean was above this
threshold (~18). Approaches to parenting prior to the intervention were measured using the
Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory 2 (AAPI-2; Bavolek and Keene, 1999) which indicates
a parent's tendency towards abuse and neglect. The mean score in the PFL cohort (~5) falls
within the 'normal' range for this scale indicating a moderate to small risk of abusive behavior.
The Pearlin Self-Efficacy scale (Pearlin and Schooler, 1978) ranges from zero to four with
higher scores indicating the respondent had a stronger feeling of control over her life. The
mean score for the PFL sample (~2.9) was below the average score of 3.14 found for a
representative American sample (The Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 2010). Normative
scores are not available for the final two psychometric scales but allow us to compare the
underlying characteristics of the low and high treatment groups. The Rosenberg measure is
used to compare levels of self-esteem among the participants - scores range from 1 to 18 with
higher scores indicating higher levels of self-esteem. The Knowledge of Infant Development
(KIDI; MacPhee, 1981) shows the percentage of correct responses to questions relating to
child development milestones.
To place the PFL cohort in context, we can compare our sample with the nationally
representative Growing up in Ireland (GUI) - Nine Month Cohort Study, which was
administered to 11,134 households (or one third of all nine-month old infants living in
Ireland) during the period September 2008 to April 2009. The GUI parents were five years
older on average than the PFL parents, with education levels in line with expected national
averages. Fewer than 11 percent of parents in the GUI sample report either a physical or
mental health condition, which is considerably lower than the PFL sample. A much smaller
proportion of the GUI sample indicated that they smoked during pregnancy (18 percent
compared with approximately 50 percent in PFL), yet the proportion of respondents who

10

drank alcohol during pregnancy was similar to PFL. A much higher proportion of the GUI
sample were married (68 percent compared with approximately 16 percent in PFL), while the
percentage that indicated having either a partner or spouse was similar to the PFL sample (88
percent compared with approximately 82 percent in PFL). Overall, this comparison highlights
that the PFL cohort reflects a relatively disadvantaged sample when compared with national
averages, with significant differences in self-reported health and objective health behaviors
such as smoking, yet there are some similarities such as presence of husband/partner.9

The Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) was used to measure IQ at 3 months postpartum. The
Vulnerable Attachment Style Questionnaire (VASQ) measures the respondents' interactions and dependence on
other people. Scores above 15 are indicative of depressive disorders. The Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory
(AAPI) measures approaches to parenting and provides an indicator of the endorsement of abuse/neglect. Scores
range from 1 to 10 with scores below 4 indicating a low risk of abusive/neglect and scores above 8 indicating a
high risk of abuse/neglect. The Pearlin Self-Efficacy scale ranges from zero to four with higher scores indicating
higher self-efficacy. The Rosenberg scale ranges from zero to 18 with higher scores indicating more maternal
self-esteem. The Knowledge of Infant Development (KIDI) score represents the percentage of correct responses
to questions relating to child development milestones. Scores range from zero to 100 and higher scores indicate
more knowledge of infant development.

3.3.2 Attrition and Non-response
Figure 2 describes the progression of the participants from programme entry until eighteen
months. The 18 month assessment captured 70 percent of the original high treatment group
and 63 percent of the original low treatment group.

On average, 19 percent of the high treatment group and 16 percent of the low treatment group
were classified as official ‘dropouts’ between baseline and eighteen months, with the majority
of dropout occurring before 6 months. Dropouts are defined as those who actively told the
PFL program staff or the evaluation team that they wanted to leave the program. Participant
who ‘missed interviews’ are those who have not officially dropped out of the program, but
were difficult to engage at the assessment point. The proportion of missed interviews across

13

the high and low treatment groups were 11 percent and 21 percent respectively between
baseline and eighteen months. Due to attrition and non-response, the estimation samples
differ at each of the data collection points. To account for the potential bias that this may
introduce, we used an inverse probability weighting technique as a robustness test. This
method is described in detail in Section 4.2.

Econometric Framework

4.1

Estimation Model and Outcome Measures

The PFL program is evaluated using an RCT. The standard model of program evaluation
describes the observed outcome Yi of participant i  I by
Yi = Di Yi(1) + (1 - Di)Yi(0)

(1)

where I = {1…N} denotes the sample space, Di denotes the treatment assignment for
participant i (Di = 1 if treatment occurs, Di = 0 otherwise) and (Yi(0), Yi(1)) are potential
outcomes for participant i.

We test the null hypothesis of no treatment effect.

This

hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that the counterfactual outcome vectors share the
d

d

same distribution H-1: Y(1) = Y(0) where = denotes equality in distribution.
Various standardized psychometric scales were administered at the six month, 12
month and 18 month data collection waves. We examine 31 outcome measures related to
child development and parenting. Table 3 summarizes each of the standardized scales. We
restrict our analysis to standardized measures that are repeated in at least two of the three time
points. This results in six child development instruments: the Ages and Stage Questionnaire
(ASQ; Squires et al., 1999); the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE;
Squires et al., 2003); an assessment of temperament based on the Infant Characteristics
Questionnaire (Bates et al., 1979); the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development

14

Inventories: Words and Gestures, Short Form (CDI-WG: Fenson et al., 2000), the Brief
Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA; Briggs-Gowan and Carter, 2006);
and finally the Developmental Profile 3, Cognitive Section (DP-3; Alpern, 2007).
Parenting behavior is examined using three standardized scales: a measure of parental
interactions with the child based on the Community Support Inventory (Centres for the
Prevention of Child Neglect, 2000); the Framingham Safety Survey (FSS; American
Academy of Pediatrics, 1991); and the Infant-Toddler version of the Home Observation for
Measurement of the Environment (HOME; Caldwell and Bradley, 1984) combined with the
Supplement to the HOME Scale for Impoverished Families (SHIF; Ertem et al., 1996).
Further information on each of these scales and the subdomains listed in Table 3 can be found

Permutation Testing

Although the RCT design in (1) is a simple specification, the use of traditional t tests for
hypothesis testing is not viable given the small sample size and the likely non-normality of
the data. Permutation methods do not depend on distributional assumptions and thus facilitate
the estimation of treatment effects in small samples. While our analysis replicates one recent
study of an early childhood intervention using this approach (Heckman et al., 2010a), it is not
yet extensively used in the policy evaluation literature.
A permutation test relies on the assumption of exchangeability under the null
hypothesis (see Good, 2005). In this paper, the observed t-statistic is recorded and compared

16

to the distribution of t-statistics that result from multiple, random permutations of the
treatment label.10 Upton (1992) reviews the literature which shows that the mid-p-value is
more suitable when dealing with discrete data; therefore we report the right-sided, mid-pvalue, which is calculated as:
( )

(

)

(

),

where P is the probability distribution, T* is the randomly permuted t-statistic, and T is the
observed t-statistic. We use one sided (right tailed) p-values in order to test whether the high
level treatment is having a positive effect on child and parenting outcomes compared to the
low level treatment. We adopt a 10% p-value to assess statistical significance.

4.3

The Stepdown Procedure

Conducting permutation tests for each of the 31 outcomes increases the likelihood of a Type I
error (rejecting a null hypothesis when it is in fact true) and studies of RCTs have been
criticized for overstating treatment effects as a result of this ‘multiplicity’ effect (Pocock et al.,
1987). To address this problem, methods have been developed which control the Family-Wise
Error Rate (FWER), the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis at a predetermined level, α (Romano, Shaikh, and Wolf, 2010). This procedure adjusts the p-values
associated with individual tests to account for the effect of testing multiple outcomes.
The stepdown procedure involves firstly calculating a test statistic for each null
hypothesis in a family of outcomes - we use the t-statistic. The test statistics are then placed in
descending order. Using the permutation testing method described above, the largest observed
t-statistic is compared with the distribution of the maximal permuted t-statistics. If the
probability of observing this statistic by chance is high (p ≥ 0.1) we fail to reject the joint null

10

100,000 replications are permuted using Monte Carlo simulations in our analyses.

17

hypothesis that the high treatment has no impact on any outcome in the cluster of hypotheses
being tested.
On the other hand, if the probability of observing this t-statistic is low (p < 0.1) we
reject the joint null hypothesis and proceed by excluding the most significant hypothesis and
testing the subset of hypotheses that remain for joint significance. This process of dropping
the most significant hypothesis continues until the resulting subset of hypotheses is accepted,
or only one hypothesis remains. ‘Stepping down’ through the hypotheses in this manner
allows us to isolate the hypotheses that lead to rejection of the null. This method is superior to
the well-known Bonferroni adjustment methods as it accounts for interdependence across the
outcomes. The Romano and Wolf (2005) method uses a weaker assumption than other
established stepwise methods (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Westfall and Wolfinger, 1997)
– monotonicity with respect to the critical values. This ensures that the largest unadjusted pvalue corresponds to the largest adjusted p-value (Heckman et al., 2010a).
The 31 outcomes measures were placed into a number of Stepdown families for the
purposes of analysis. The outcomes included in each family should be correlated and
represent an underlying construct, however outcomes which are derived from the same
measure should not be included in the same Stepdown family. For the child development
outcomes, we include one Stepdown family at 6 months (ASQ) and 4 at 12 and 18 months
(ASQ, CDI, CDI NORM, & BITSEA). For the parenting outcomes, we include two Stepdown
families at 6 and 12 months (HOME & HOME and SHIF).

Results

5.1

Analysis of Treatment Effects at Six, Twelve and Eighteen Months11

The impact of the program on child development and parenting are presented in Tables 4 and
5. We present the mean outcome scores by group, the p-values that result from individual
permutation testing (p(i)), and the adjusted p-values calculated using the stepdown procedure
(p(ii)). These results are presented for each of three waves. Note that in order to implement
the stepdown method, all measures included in a stepdown category must be scored in a
consistent direction given that we employ one-tailed tests.
Superscripts are presented for the p(ii) values, indicating their relative magnitude
within the block. Thus superscript 1 indicates the measure which corresponds to the largest tstatistic. Each adjusted p(ii)-value represents the likelihood of rejecting the joint null
hypothesis when the variables of higher ordering are excluded. For example, in Table 4, the
first adjusted p(ii)-value (0.441) in the ASQ Scores category is the result of jointly testing all
six outcomes in that category. The next adjusted p(ii)-value (0.483) is the result of excluding
the ASQ Gross Motor Score variable from the joint-hypothesis test. The adjusted p(ii)-value
of 0.800 is the result of excluding both the ASQ Gross Motor Score and the ASQ
Communication Score. Thus, as we step down through the hypotheses, the most statically
significant variables are excluded. We order this stepdown reporting in line with the 6 month
data in our tables.

11

As the potential for contamination in PFL is high given the geographical proximity of the participants, a
number of strategies were devised to measure cross-talk and information flows between the two treatment
groups (information on these strategies can be found in Doyle & Hickey, 2013). Results of this analysis find that
while the conditions for contamination or spillover effects is quite high as participants are regularly in contact
with each and share material, the blue-dye analysis suggests that these practices do not translate into improved
parenting knowledge among the low treatment group suggesting that contamination from the high to low
treatment group is quite low (see Doyle & PFL Evaluation Team, 2013).

19

5.1.1 Child Development
Table 4 presents the results for the child development outcomes. The results indicate that
there is little evidence of a treatment effect on development measures at the early stages of the
children’s lives. Only three of the individual test statistics are statistically significant (ASQ
Fine Motor at 12 months, ASQ Gross Motor at 18 months, and DP-3 Cognitive Development
at 18 months). The ASQ fine scores measure the child’s ability to engage in developmentally
appropriate finger and hand movements, while the ASQ gross motor scores measure the
child’s ability to display developmentally appropriate movement skills (e.g. walking and
kicking). The DP-3 Cognitive Development score measures the child’s general cognitive
abilities. However, the stepdown procedure fails to reject the null hypothesis of no treatment
effect on child development outcomes at six months, 12 months and 18 months.
The available literature on the impact of interventions on early child development is
consistent with our results. With respect to cognitive development, Anisfeld et al. (2004)
report that the Healthy Families America has no impact at six or 12 months. Similarly, the
German Pro Kind program (Jungmann et al., 2009) does not have an effect on cognitive
functioning at six month based on simple t-tests on a small sample (N = 76).
With respect to noncognitive skills, in contrast to our results, Olds et al. (2002) use a
Logit model on a relatively large sample (N= 543) and find that the Nurse Family Partnership
program is effective at reducing emotional vulnerability in response to fear stimuli at six
months. While Jungmann et al. (2009) find that Pro Kind reduces the presence of symptoms
of a difficult temperament at six months. Overall, we do not identify a precisely determined
treatment effect with respect to any non-cognitive development measures (Difficult
Temperament, ASQ Personal Social Score, ASQ Social-Emotional Score, BITSEA).

5.1.2 Parenting
The results for parenting outcomes are presented in Table 5. The format of the table is the
same as that of Table 4. For the HOME instrument, the variety measure (which measures the
child’s frequency of interaction with individuals other than their mother along with the variety
of the child’s play environment) and the learning measure (which relates to the number of
toys and books in the home which are designed to facilitate child development) were found to
be statistically significant at 6 months using the individual permutation testing method. The
first stepdown p-value is also statistically significant, indicating a rejection of the joint-null
hypothesis of no effect across all subdomains. In the next step, when the variety measure is
excluded and the remaining subdomains are tested, the joint-null hypothesis is also rejected.
This reinforces the evidence of a positive treatment effect on each of these home environment
measures. At 18 months a statistically significant effect was found for the acceptance measure
(which represents parental acceptance of negative behaviour from the child and avoidance of
unnecessary punishment) using the individual testing method. However, this effect was no
longer precisely determined when adjusted for joint-hypothesis testing. Together these results
suggest that the PFL mentoring program successfully prompted parents to provide variety and
quality learning materials to their children and there is some evidence that it also encouraged
parents to accept their child’s behavior. Overall, the results for the home environment are
weaker at 18 months than those estimated at 6 months.
For the HOME and SHIF combined instrument, a statistically significant treatment
effect was estimated for the childcare subdomain (which relates to the range and adequacy of
the care arrangements) and the toys and books subdomain (which counts the total number of
stimulating play materials and books in the home) when the individual permutation testing
method was applied. An examination of the stepdown results indicates that the joint-null
hypothesis is also rejected giving strong evidence of a true impact of the program on the

23

home environment. In the second step, when the childcare measure is excluded and the
remaining measures are jointly tested, the joint-null hypothesis can no longer be rejected. This
indicates that the impact of the program on the childcare subdomain is driving the rejection of
the joint-null hypothesis. At 18 months, a statistically significant treatment effect was found
with respect to the restriction subdomain (which measures the level of restraint the parent
places on the child during the visit, in the form of physical punishment and scolding, as well
as inappropriate handling by older children) when the individual testing method was used.
However, this effect is no longer precisely determined when adjusted for joint-hypothesis
testing. Together the results for the HOME and SHIF instrument indicate that there is strong
evidence that the treatment successfully impacted upon the mother’s choice to use appropriate
childcare for their baby. There is some weaker evidence to also indicate that mothers in the
high treatment group were more likely to have appropriate toys and books to aid the child’s
development and they were less likely to employ inappropriate punishment approaches. The
total score on the SHIF instrument was also tested separately and the high treatment group
was found to score significantly higher than the low treatment group at 6 months. This
provides further evidence of a significant treatment effect with respect to the home
environment.
The interaction with baby scale contains no subdomains and therefore it was not
included in the stepdown procedure. However, the individual permutation testing result is
statistically significant at both six months and 18 months. Mothers in the high treatment group
were more likely to engage in activities such as peek-a-boo games, storytelling, and taking
their child shopping.
Many other home visiting programs have used the HOME inventory as an outcome
measure at six, 12, and 18 months. In line with our results, many of these studies find positive
effects on the quality of the home environment. Using the MANOVA testing method Culp
24

(2004) reports that the Community-based Family Resource Service Program had a positive
impact on the acceptance and organization subscales at both six months and 12 months.
Similarly, Wagner (1996) finds a positive effect of the Parents as Teachers program on the
total HOME score, the responsivity domain, and the play domain at 12 months. Also, at the
18 month milestone, Black et al. (1994) find a positive effect of a home intervention for drug
abusing mothers on the variety and responsivity domains, as well as the overall HOME score.
While the interaction with baby scale used in the PFL evaluation has not been used in
other evaluations of home visiting programs, similar measures such as the Nurse Child
Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST, Sumner and Spietz, 1994) have been used to measure
parent-child interactions and activities with the child during structured play. The literature
examined shows no evidence of a treatment effect on the NCAST measure at the six months,
12 months or 18 months (Anisfeld et al. (2004) with Healthy Families America at 6 and 12
months; Caughy et al. (2004) with Healthy Steps at 18 months; Duggan et al. (1999) with
Hawaii’s Healthy Start Program; Koniak-Griffen et al. (2002) with The Early Intervention
program at 12 months). Using similar measures to examine the level of stimulation that
parents provide for their children, other studies have also found no significant impact of home
visiting by 18 months (Siegel et al. (1980) with the Hospital and Home Support Intervention
During Infancy at 4 and 12 months; Schuler et al. (2002) at 18 months for an early
intervention for drug-using mothers). In contrast, we find that PFL has a robust effect on
parent-child interactions and this result is statistically significant at both six months and 18
months postpartum.

5.2 Robustness Tests
5.2.1 Addressing Attrition and Non-Response
Due to attrition and non-response, the estimation sample sizes differ at each data collection
point. To account for the potential bias that attrition and non-response may introduce, we test
the robustness of the main analysis using an inverse probability weighting (IPW) technique.
This involves two main steps: first a logit model is applied to calculate the probability of
completing the research questionnaire at each time point using an exhaustive set of baseline
characteristics. Second, the predicted probabilities from the logit models are applied as
weights in the permutation analysis so that a larger weight is applied to individuals that are
underrepresented in the sample due to missing observations.
With over a hundred baseline measures that could potentially be included as righthand side variables in the logit model, it was necessary to restrict this variable set. In order to
do this, we first ran bivariate analyses in which 133 baseline measures were tested to
determine whether a statistically significant difference existed between attrited and nonattrited groups. Note that the attrited group includes participants who officially dropped out of
the program and those who did not complete a questionnaire at that particular assessment
point, but may engage at another assessment point. The permutation testing method (using
10,000 replications) was employed to individually examine each measure and the testing was
carried out separately for each estimation sample (6 months, 12 months and 18 months). In
addition, within each estimation sample, the low and high treatment group were examined
separately to allow for differential attrition processes in the two dosage groups. This resulted
in six different sets of bivariate analyses. Overall, across all six analyses, the number of
measures for which statistically significant (p-value < 0.1) differences were found between
the attrition and non-attrition samples ranged from 17 to 35 measures out of 133, representing
differences on 13-26 percent of the measures analyzed. Overall, the bivariate analyses suggest

28

that mothers who stay engaged with the program are a more socially advantaged group. For
example, in five of the six analyses higher IQ scores were significant predictors of
participating in the survey, in three analyses employed mothers were more likely to
participate, and across all six analyses mothers with lower education or literacy difficulties
were more likely to dropout.
In order to select the baseline predictor set which should be included in each of the
corresponding six logit models, we exclude any measure which was not statistical significant
in the bivariate analyses. Also, in order to maximize the sample size, we restricted the
baseline variable set by excluding any measure for which there were missing observations at
baseline. We made one exception, however, with respect to the measure of cognitive
resources. This instrument was administered to mothers when their baby had reached three
months of ages and, therefore, some participants who completed a baseline interview did not
complete this assessment. We included the measure of cognitive resources in our logit model
as it was found to be a consistent predictor of attrition in the bivariate analysis.12 Specifically,
mothers who stayed in the program were likely to have higher levels of cognitive resources.
Overall, a measure of cognitive resources is available for 88 percent of mothers who
completed a baseline interview.
As the sample size for each logit model was quite small (low = 101; high = 90), some
additional variables needed to be excluded due to lack of variation.13 This resulted in six final

12

The cognitive resources measure is a significant predictor of attrition in five out of six bivariate attrition
analyses. Specifically, mothers with lower cognitive resources in the high treatment group were more likely to
miss their 6 month, 12 month and 18 month interviews. Similarly mothers with lower cognitive resources in the
low treatment group were also more likely to miss their 12 months and 18 month interview. In each of these
analyses we found moderate to large Cohen’s D effect sizes, ranging from 0.618 (6 months, high treatment
group) to 0.995 (12 months, low treatment group). One exception was the low treatment group at 6 months: for
this cohort no significant difference was found between mothers who participated and those who did not
participate with respect to the measure of cognitive resources.
13
This only applied to the low treatment group. Many of the binary variables which were included in the logit
models at each of the three waves were unbalanced. That is to say that when the dependent variable is tabulated
against each of these binary predictor measures there are zero observations in certain cells. This, in turn, implies
that at certain values these binary variables are perfect predictors of success in the logit model. This leads to a

29

logit models in which a dummy variable (1 = non-attrition; 0 = attrition) was regressed on a
restricted variable set ranging in size from seven variables to 13 variables. Although the
bivariate analyses suggest that mothers who stay engaged with the program are a more
socially advantaged group, the results from the multivariate analyses indicate few statistically
significant predictors of attrition. For further details of the estimation model employed to
calculate the probability weights see Table E1 in Appendix E.
After the probability of non-attrition was calculated using this technique, the weights
were merged with the outcome datasets. Applying the inverse of each weight in our inference
estimations ensures that a larger weight is applied to the participants that are underrepresented in each estimation sample. Tables 6 and 7 show these results and can be read in
the same manner as Tables 4 and 5.
Child Development
Table 6 shows that correcting for attrition bias in the domain of child development leads to
more precisely determined results. Specifically, the statistically significant difference between
the low and high treatment group with respect to the ASQ fine motor domain at 12 months
rises from the 10% significance level to the 5% significance level. Similarly, at 18 months,
the p-value associated with the DP-3 Cognitive Development measures raises from the 10%
level to the 5% level, and a statistically significant difference is also found for the ASQ
Personal Social domain, which was not found before. Most interestingly, at 18 months, we
can now reject the joint null hypothesis of no impact on child development and the ASQ gross
motor domain is found to be driving this rejection. This suggests that when we correct for
misrepresentation due to attrition bias, the original child development estimates which were
presented in Table 4 are echoed with more precision.

loss of observations if these measures are included in the model. We excluded these variables in order to
maximize the sample size. This lead to the exclusion of 7 variables at 6 months, 2 variables at 12 months, and 1
variable at 18 months. Notice that as the number of attritors increase, this problem dissipates.

Parenting
Table 7 shows that while correcting for attrition bias leads to quite similar results for the child
development measures, the adjustment leads to less precision when estimating program
effects on parenting. Firstly, with respect to the 6 month results, for the HOME category, the
same two subdomains (variety and learning) remain statistically significant when tested
individually. Also, the joint null hypothesis can still be rejected, although the stepdown pvalue is now less precise at the 10% level (as compared with the 5% level in Table 5). When
the variety measure is excluded from joint testing, we now fail to reject the null hypothesis of
no effect on the remaining HOME measures. This indicates that the attrition correction leads
to weaker evidence of a treatment effect on the learning domain. With respect to the HOME
and SHIF combined instrument, the childcare and toys and books subdomains remain
statistically significant when tested individually. However, the joint-null hypothesis can no
longer be rejected. Also, the total SHIF score and the interactions with baby measure are no
longer statistically significant. At 18 months, a statistically significant difference remains
between the low and high treatment group with respect to the HOME subdomain of
acceptance. However, the HOME and SHIF combined subdomain of restriction is no longer
statistically significant. A statistically significant difference remains between the low and high
treatment group with respect to the measure of interactions with baby at 18 months. Overall,
correcting for attrition with respect to parenting measures leads to weaker precision with
respect to estimates of the program effect, however quite a similar pattern emerges.

5.2.2 Addressing Missing Data
While the degree of item non-response was minimal for the majority of standardised instruments
used (less than 2% at each time point)14, there were more substantial cases of missing data on the
Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) and Supplement to the HOME
Scale for Impoverished Families (SHIF) instrument. Missing data on the HOME/SHIF measure
arises for two reasons. First, as some of the HOME/SHIF items are based on observations of
parent-child interactions, if the child is not present or is asleep when the interview takes place,
these items cannot be measured. 25% of children were not present at the 6 month interview and
39% were not present at the 18 month interview. Second, as some of the items in the HOME are
based on observation of materials available in the home, these items cannot be assessed if the
interview is not conducted in the home. 16% of interviews were not conducted in the home at the
6 month interview and 21% were conducted outside of the home at 18 months. One concern is
that there may be an element of self-selection by parents who either did not want the interview to
be conducted in the home or did not want their child to be present for the interview.
To address this issue, an inverse probability weighting method was applied using a similar
approach to that described in Section 5.2.1. However, rather than constructing one set of weights
for each data collection wave, instead multiple sets were constructed so that the each of the 31
variables were modelled individually at each wave. Thus, rather than using baseline measure to
predict the likelihood of participating in each survey, instead we modelled the likelihood of data
being available for each individual measure. Observations which are classified as missing include
those that were lost to attrition as well as those who participated in the survey but did provide data
for the corresponding outcome. The analyses were again carried out separately for the low and
high treatment group to allow for differential missing data patterns in each dosage group. As in
14

One exception is the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: Words and Gestures, Short
Form (CDI-WG: Fenson et al., 2000) scale items. For the items on this scale, the level of missing data was less
than 11% at 12 months and less than 6 percent at 18 months. The CDI-WG manual instructs that measure should
not be imputed (Fenson et al., 2000). This instrument is completed by parents using a paper form. It contains 104
items and it is likely that mothers could miss some questions. Therefore, the data are likely to be missing at
random.

36

Section 5.2.1, we first conducted bivariate analysis across 133 baseline variables to check for
statistical difference between the individuals who provided data and those who did not. This
resulted in 136 separate bivariate analyses. The corresponding logit models were then constructed
by using only the significant variables from the bivariate analyses that contained no missing data
(with the exception of the cognitive resources measure as described before). Also, in situations
where binary predictor measures resulted in a loss of observations in the logit model due to a lack
of variation, these measures were also excluded from the right-hand side using the same approach
as that described previously. The analyses presented in Tables 8 and 9 represent the impact of the
program on child development and parenting while correcting for missing data using IPW. The
method leads to very similar results to those which were found for the correction of attrition bias.
The only difference found in Table 8 as compared with Table 6 is that the stepdown adjusted pvalue associated with the ASQ gross motor score subdomain at 18 months is no longer
statistically significant. With respect to parenting measures, Table 9 differs from Table 7 in that
the stepdown adjusted p-value associated with the HOME variety subdomain is no longer
statistically significant and the individual p-value associated with the toys and books subdomain is
no longer statistically significant when tested using the individual permutation testing method.

Correcting for attrition leads to largely similar results regarding child development yet
weaker results for the parenting measures. The predictors of staying engaged in the program
suggested that mothers who dropout are more socially disadvantaged that those who remain.
Therefore, the results in Tables 7 and 9 appear to suggest that more advantaged families
benefit more from the program with respect to parenting outcomes. In order to understand the
contrast, subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether the treatment effects for the
participants with above median IQ scores differed from those with median IQ scores or below.
No obvious pattern emerged from these subgroup analyses. At 6 months, more significant
treatment effects were found for the higher IQ group, while at 12 and 18 months there are
more significant treatment effects for the lower IQ group. Also it does not appear that effects
37

differ for child development and parenting. Given that parenting measures, and the HOME
measure in particular, suffer most from the problem of missing data, it is possible that the
weaker estimation in the parenting outcomes is due to the small sample size and a lack of
representative observations with which to weight the estimates.

5.3 Reliability of Instruments
One potential limitation of our study is that the majority of instruments used rely on maternal
self-reporting. These subjective measures may be less reliable than objective indicators as
parents may misreport their children’s level of development and their own parenting skills. .
There is evidence of low-to-moderate cross-informant correlations in terms of child
behavioural/emotional problems (Achenbach, McConaughy, and Howell 1987); and a study
conducted within the current catchment area found that parents in the community
systematically reported higher child skill levels compared to teacher reports (Doyle, Finnegan,
& McNamara, 2012). If parents in both the high and low treatment groups systematically under
or over-report the outcomes under analysis, this will not bias the results regarding program
effectiveness as the magnitude of the difference will be the same, however if one group
systematically misreports and the other does not, this will bias our estimates of program
effectiveness.

To test the reliability of the self-reported measures we took advantage of the
availability of observational items in the HOME and SHIF instruments. Restricting our
analysis to solely observational items led to results at 18 months which echo those presented
in Table 5 (available upon request). Specifically, at 18 months, the significant differences
between the high and low treatment groups with respect to the acceptance and restriction
subdomains remain when the analysis is restricted to observational items. In addition, the
significant result for the total SHIF score remains. Two additional significant effects were
also found with respect to the organisiation and interaction subdomains which could suggest
that the element of noise associated with self-reported measures is masking some true effects.
In addition, our main measure of child development, the ASQ, is a well-established
child development screening tool and a number of studies have found that it is highly
correlated with other previously validated measures that are completed by professionals (see

43

Squires, Bricker, and Potter, 1997; Squires et al., 1999). In particular, the overall level of
agreement between the ASQ and standardised assessments such as the Bayley Scales of Infant
Development (Bayley, 1969) was 85%, ranging from 76% for the 4 month ASQ to 91% for
the 36 month ASQ. In addition, the measure’s sensitivity, its ability to detect delayed
development, and its specificity, its ability to correctly identify typically developing children,
was also in keeping with standards in the literature which identify acceptable levels of
sensitivity and specificity for developmental screening tests at 70% and 80% respectively
(Barnes, 1982, as cited in Duby et al., 2006). Other studies have also found evidence to
suggest that the ASQ is a valid screening tool (Gollenberg et al., 2009; Skellern, Rogers, and
O’Callaghan, 2007). Overall the literature suggests that there is considerable agreement
between the ASQ and standardised measures that are conducted by professionals.

Summary and Conclusion

This paper investigates the effectiveness of investment in an early childhood program from in
utero to 18 months of age on key indicators of early skill formation, and on parenting skills.
We find significant effects of the program on parenting (specifically the Home Observation
for Measurement of the Environment, the Supplement to the HOME for Impoverished
Families and Interactions with Baby). Although, these results were weakened to some extent
when we corrected for attrition bias, a similar pattern of effects emerged which reinforces the
original findings.
Overall, with respect to child development, we find little evidence of a statistically
significant effect, a result which is consistent with previous evaluations of home visiting
programs which have examined early child outcomes (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2009; Gomby, Curloss, & Behrman, 1999). The estimated impact of the program on
child development was more precise when we corrected for attrition bias, suggesting that the

44

few identified effects in the original analyses represent a true, tangible impact on child
development at 18 months. This is a promising result given the Smitsman and Corbetta (2010)
finding that developmental advances and delays are extremely difficult to detect in very
young children.
However, our analysis suggests that home visiting programs can be an effective means
of improving deficits in early parenting skills and the home environment within a relatively
short time frame. In home visiting programs such as PFL, parents are conceived as the
primary mechanism for change. Thus the main avenue by which child skills can develop and
grow is via changes in parenting skills and abilities. These new strategies and skills, which
have been developed through interactions with family mentors and PFL materials, may take
time to have an impact on infant behaviour and development. Indeed, the majority of studies
that calculate high returns to early childhood investment are based on analyses conducted
when the participating children have reached the teenage years or adulthood (Olds et al.,
1997b; Heckman et al., 2010a). This study suggests that improvements in early parenting
skills may be one such mechanism that accounts for these later findings. The theory on human
skill formation points to a skill multiplier effect (Cunha and Heckman, 2007), and there may
be periods of latency.
In addition, the lack of sizable effects on key dimensions of child development may be
attributable to dosage and timing. Recall that the average PFL participant began engaging
with the program half way into their pregnancy (21 weeks) and had received, on average, 27
home visits between program entry and 18 months. It is possible that this small window of
intervention did not allow enough time for the participants to adopt the strategies advised by
their mentors as the bond between mentor and participant was still being formed (Ammerman
et al. 2006).

45

From a methodological perspective, a naive evaluation strategy (which examines each
outcome individually, and calculates the proportion of outcomes for which a significant
difference is found) would indicate a significant effect for 25 percent of outcomes (6/24) at
six months, 7 percent of outcomes (1/14) at 12 months, and 16 percent of outcomes (5/30) at
18 months. This could be intrepreted as an overall significant effect. Indeed, this strategy of
examining the proportion of results that are statistically significant is employed in Kahn and
Moore (2010) to define programs that are “found to work”.15 Similarly, Avellar and Paulsell
(2011) note that few of the studies examined as part of the Home Visiting Evidence of
Effectiveness (HomVee) Review make corrections for multiple outcomes and advise caution
when interpreting the significance of the findings presented in the literature. In our analysis,
the p-values have been adjusted to account for the increased likelihood of a Type I error in a
multiple hypotheses setting. This more rigorous method indicates fewer program effects than
a naive approach, which examines all outcomes separately. However, the small differences
we have identified between the low and high treatment groups could potentially result in large
returns over time.
Early childhood interventions have received relatively little attention in Europe, yet
given the social, economic, and cultural differences, especially with respect to the social
welfare system, it cannot be assumed that the findings from seminal American studies can be
extended to European countries.16 Further analysis of later waves of outcome data will be
examined to understand the true effectiveness of home visiting programs in non-US settings.

15

The authors do no define the cutoff they use but suggest that if 4 of 7 or 5 of 9 measures were found to be
statistically significant, the program would be defined as “found to work”.
16
The PFL project is part of The European Network on Early Childhood Interventions (ENECI) linking
researchers conducting the experimental evaluations of early childhood programs in non-U.S. settings.

Appendix B2 PFL Curriculum
Common Supports
Developmental Materials
Families in both the high and low treatment groups receive developmental packs annually to the
value of approximately ~€100pa. The first developmental pack includes a number of safety items,
such as corner guards, angle latches, and heat sensitive spoons, plus a baby gym/play mat. The
second pack includes developmental appropriate toys such as puzzles, activity toys, and bricks.
The third pack includes cookery/construction sets, puzzles and memory games. The fourth pack
includes a magnetic game, a doctor’s case, a lace-up shoe and a tea set. The fifth pack is still
under development.
Public Health Information
Both groups are also encouraged to attend two public health workshops in the community. The
Stress Control Programme, which is run by external facilitators, involves six one-hour weekly
sessions which focuses on enabling individuals to identify how they consciously and
subconsciously feed their stress, as well as describing what stress is, and the indicators of stress.
The programme also teaches techniques and strategies to manage stress. Participants receive a set
of booklets and a relaxation CD. For more details on this programme please see
www.glasgowsteps.com.
The second health programme offered is the Healthy Food Made Easy programme, which is
facilitated by one of the mentors and involves six two hour sessions. The aim of the programme
is to improve nutritional knowledge, attitudes and behaviour by learning about basic nutritional
theories and participating in practical cookery sessions. It is a peer led programme which
emphasises group learning through discussion, worksheets and hand-outs, quizzes, problem
solving games, food preparation and cookery.
Facilitated Access to Enhanced Preschool
A preschool place for one-year has also been reserved for all PFL children in the local childcare
centres. PFL covers the cost of this for those families experiencing exceptional financial
difficulty. However, it should be noted that all PFL children will now be eligible for a new
Government scheme which provides every three year old child in Ireland with access to a free
preschool place for one year.
Access to a Support Worker
Participants are given a directory of local services and have access to a PFL support worker who
can help them connect to additional community services if needed. Details about coffee
mornings and other community events are sent via group text or online. Finally, both treatment
groups receive a framed professional photograph of their child as well as programme newsletters
and special occasion (e.g., birthday) cards.
It should be noted that families in the low treatment group have access to an Information Officer
who acts as the point of contact for parents; while families in the high treatment group have a
home visiting mentor assigned to each household. The role of the information officer is to meet

63

with the families in the low treatment group before birth and contact the family at various
intervals, such as when sending developmental packs, and when the child is due to begin
childcare. Families in the low treatment group may contact the information officer at any time
with queries regarding public services-as-usual for their child or queries regarding PFL events.
However, the Information Officer may not provide the participants in the low treatment group
with any information related to parenting or child development.
Additional High Treatment Supports
Home Visits from a Trained Mentor
Participants in the high treatment group avail of a home-visiting mentor support service. Each
family has an assigned mentor who visits the home for between 30 minutes and two hours
starting during pregnancy and continuing until the child starts school. Originally, it was
anticipated that each family would receive a weekly home visit. However, early on in the
implementation process it became evident that weekly home visits were not achievable from the
families’ point of view. Therefore the programme changed this weekly requirement, such that the
frequency of the visits depends on the needs of the families, with the majority of families
receiving fortnightly visits, and some monthly.
The home visits are facilitated by trained mentors with a cross section of professional
backgrounds including education, social care, youth studies, psychology, and early childcare and
education. Although the professional qualifications of the mentors are diverse, each mentor
completed extensive training on the PFL Programme Manual. The role of the mentors is to build
a good relationship with parents, provide them with high quality information and to be
responsive to issues that arise. Through these efforts the PFL Programme aims to enable parents
to make informed choices and connect them to other community services (Preparing for Life &
The Northside Partnership, 2008). The mentors focus on five general areas related to child
development: 1) pre-birth; 2) nutrition; 3) rest and routine; 4) cognitive and social development;
and 5) mother and her supports. These areas were selected during the development phase as they
were highlighted as areas of need in this community.
The aim of the home visits is to support and help the parents with key parenting issues using a
set of PFL developed Tip Sheets. The Tip Sheets are colourful representations of information
related to child development presented in a clear, concise manner and were developed by PFL
staff based on available information from local organisations such as the Health Service
Executive, the Department of Health and Children, and Barnardos Children’s Charity. The Tip
Sheets were designed at a reading level of a 12 year old and are used to facilitate the home
visiting sessions. The Tip Sheets are given to the participant after discussion with the mentor and
remain with the participant to serve as an on-going parenting resource. The Tip Sheets are
designed to be delivered based on the age of the child and the needs of the family, however, the
participants must have received the full set of Tip Sheets by the end of the programme.
Participants in the high treatment group can also avail of baby massage through individual or
group sessions with one of the mentors until their baby is approximately 10 months old. There
are three individual baby massage sessions and four group-based baby massage sessions,

64

followed by a refresher session. Finally, the high treatment group are invited to coffee mornings
hosted by the mentors.
Triple P Group Parent Training
Secondly, participants in the high treatment supports group also participate in group parent
training using the Triple P Positive Parenting Programme (Sanders, Markie-Dadds, & Turner,
2003). Triple P aims to improve positive parenting through the use of videos, vignettes, role play,
and tip sheets in a group-based setting for eight consecutive weeks (two hours per week for the
first four weeks followed by three weeks of phone support and a final two hour group session on
week eight). The group-based component of the Triple P programme has been subject to multiple
rigorous evaluations which have demonstrated positive effects for both parents and children
(Sanders, Markie-Dadds, Tully, & Bor, 2000). The Triple P programme is delivered to
participants in the high treatment group when their children are at least two-years old. As this
paper examines child outcomes at six, 12 and 18 months of age, we cannot yet examine the
impact of the Triple P component.

Appendix B3 Example of Tipsheets

Labour
Labour is the process of giving birth
Every birth follows its own pattern and
timetable, and usually takes between four and
twelve hours.

The baby in the drawing is
ready to be born. It is lying
in the correct position with
head downwards.

A placenta (afterbirth)
B uterus (womb)
C backbone
D amniotic fluid
E cervix (neck of womb)
F vagina
G pelvis (hip bone)
H plug of mucus

The three stages of labour
Stage 1: The neck of the womb opens
When you notice one or more of the following signs, you will know that labour has
started:






A show – a bloodstained mucus plug that comes from the opening of the
cervix at the bottom of the womb. This may happen 1-3 days before labour
begins.
Your waters break – this is a gush of water from the vagina which shows
that the water sac around the baby has burst. This usually means that labour
pains will start within the next 24-48 hours. Always inform your midwife or
doctor when your waters break.
The most obvious sign of labour is frequent, painful tummy cramps (labour
pains) every 10 minutes or more often. Let your midwife or doctor know when
this happens and prepare to go into the hospital.

66

If you’re not sure whether you are in labour or not, ring your maternity hospital,
midwife or doctor for advice.
Stage 1 continued: The neck of the womb opens
During the first stage of labour, contractions of the
muscles in the wall of the womb gradually open the cervix.
At some time during this stage, the waters break. The
first stage of labour is the longest stage and it comes to
an end when the cervix has opened wide enough for the
baby’s head to pass through. (10 cms)
Stage 2: The baby passes through the birth canal
The womb, cervix and vagina have by now become one birth canal. The contractions
are very strong and they push the baby head-first through the birth canal. The
mother must help to push.
When the baby’s head comes out, the midwife may
clear mucus from the baby’s nose and mouth.
The midwife or doctor now eases the baby’s shoulders
through the birth canal and the baby slides out into
the world.
Stage 3: The baby becomes a separate person
Once the baby is breathing, the umbilical cord is clamped in two places and a cut is
made between them. This separates the baby from the mother. Cutting the cord
does not hurt the mother or the baby.
When the baby is first born, the skin is a
bluish colour. As soon as the baby starts
to breathe the skin quickly turns pink.
The contractions continue until the placenta (afterbirth) is separated from the
wall of the womb and has been pushed out through the vagina. The mother may be
given an injection to speed up the process. Labour is now completed.
67

Listening and Talking

Children get better at talking when
they are given lots of chances to listen,
and also to use words. You can make this
fun for yourself and your child.

Things you can do to help your child:

 Listen together and name some of the sounds you hear around you

 Play ‘I hear with my little ear’ something that goes ‘woof’ (or

‘miaow’.)
 Say an alphabet sound and help your child to find something that
starts with that sound, e.g. b for ball; s for sock; d for doll.
 Make up rhymes or songs about everyday activities that your
child is doing.
 Sing or read nursery rhymes.
Here are two action rhymes you could play with your child:
Show your child how to make a spider with his/her hand, and do actions for
the rain falling down and the spider climbing up and falling down.

Incy Wincy spider
Climbing up the spout
Down comes the rain
And washes poor Wincy out
Out comes the sun
Dries up all the rain
Incy Wincy spider
Climbing up again

69

Show your child how to bend one arm for the spout, the other for the handle, and
do the actions for tipping up and pouring out.

I’m a little teapot
Short and stout

Here’s my handle
Here’s my spout

When the tea is ready
Hear me shout

‘Pick me up and
Pour me out!’

Appendix D
Standardized Scales Uses to Measure Child and Parent Outcomes
Child Development
We focus on six child development instruments: the Ages and Stage Questionnaire (ASQ;
Squires et al., 1999); the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE; Squires et
al., 2003); an assessment of temperament based on the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire
(Bates et al., 1979); the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: Words and
Gestures, Short Form (CDI-WG: Fenson et al., 2000), the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and
Emotional Assessment (BITSEA; Briggs-Gowan and Carter, 2006); and finally the
Developmental Profile 3, Cognitive Section (DP-3; Alpern, 2007).
Ages and Stage Questionnaire
Using the ASQ questionnaire that specifically relates to child development at six months of age,
mothers were asked to indicate whether their children could perform thirty different tasks. There
are three possible answers to each question: yes (10 points), sometimes (5 points), and no (0
points). These items are divided into five sub domains entitled communication, gross motor, fine
motor, problem solving, personal-social each with possible scores ranging from zero to 60.
Higher scores are indicative of more advanced child development.
Ages and Stage Questionnaire: Social-Emotional
The infant’s social-emotional behaviour was assessed using the ASQ:SE questionnaire, a
supplement to the traditional ASQ. The 19 items in this questionnaire relate to the child’s
tendency towards the following behaviours: to calm and settle down, to accept direction, to
communicate feelings, to cope with physiological needs (e.g. sleeping, eating), to respond
without guidance (move to independence), to demonstrate feelings for others, to initiate social
responses to parents and others. The mother indicates whether her child exhibits each behaviour
most of the time (10 points), sometimes (5 points), or never (0 points). Additionally, the mother
was asked whether the particular behaviour was a concern for her. If the mother answered yes to
any item, an additional 5 points was added resulting in a total possible score ranging from zero to
285. Higher scores indicate a more negative outcome.
Difficult Temperament
The mothers were asked seven questions taken from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child
Development (QLSCD) which are based on the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire (Bates,
Freeland, & Lounsbury, 1979). The questions relate to whether the child gets upset easily or
demonstrates fussy behaviour. Each item is scored on a six point scale resulting in a total
possible range of one to 42, where higher scores are indicative of a more difficult temperament.
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: Words and Gestures (CDIWG)
CDI-WG is a parent report instrument for assessing language and communication skills in
children. It provides norms for children aged 8 to 16 months of age. The CDI inventories
measure a range of early communicative and representational skills that are related to language
development in typically developing and language-delayed children. The CDI-WG consists of
83

three sections; first signs of understanding, First communicative gestures, and a vocabulary
checklist.
Participants were asked to complete the CDI-WG with pen and paper before beginning the main
part of the interview. The first section, ‘first signs of understanding’, contained 3 questions with
the response options yes or no. In the second section, ‘first communicative gestures’, there were
12 questions with the response options not yet, sometimes and often. The final section contained
an 89-word ‘vocabulary checklist’ with 3 separate columns; understands, understands and says
and does not understand or say. First signs of understanding, and first communicative gestures
each produced a summed raw score. The vocabulary checklist columns ‘understands’ and
‘understands and says’ provided 2 scores: words understood and words produced. These were
then normed by age and gender, according to Fenson et al. (2000). In total, the CDI produces
four scores.
Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA)
The BITSEA is a 42-item screening tool for social-emotional/behavioural problems and delays in
competence in children aged twelve months to thirty-six months. This version is a shortened
version of the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA). The BITSEA yields a
problem score and a competence score. Problem score items include externalising (6 items),
internalising (8 items) and dysregulation problems (8 items). Competence score items include
areas of attention, compliancy, mastery, motivation, pro-social peer relations, empathy, play
skills and social relatedness (11 items). The interviewer asked participants to verbally rate each
item on a 3 point scale (0 = not true/rarely, 1 = somewhat true/sometimes, 2 = very true/often).
Items were summed to obtain a total score, with higher Problem scores indicating greater levels
of social-emotional or behavioural problems and lower Competence scores indicating possible
delays/deficits in competence. These scores were normed by child gender.
Developmental Profile 3- Cognitive Section
The DP-3 is a parent report measure of child development from birth to age 12 years and 11
months. The PFL evaluation included the DP-3 cognitive section which measures cognitive
abilities in an indirect manner. This is a 38 item scale, starting at number 1 and continuing until
the stop rule is satisfied (i.e. when five consecutive no responses are recorded). Each of the items
refer to tasks which require cognitive skill and are arranged in order of difficulty, for example,
‘When an adult points to something, does the child usually look where the adult has pointed?’.
For each item, participants were asked whether their child had carried out the task and responded
yes or no accordingly. The Yes responses were tabulated to create a continuous score whereby
higher values indicated greater cognitive development.
Parenting
Parenting behavior is examined using three standardized scales: a measure of parental
interactions with child based on the Community Support Inventory (Centres for the Prevention of
Child Neglect, 2000); the Framingham Safety Survey (FSS; American Academy of Pediatrics,
1991); and the Infant-Toddler version of the Home Observation for Measurement of the
Environment (HOME; Caldwell and Bradley, 1984) combined with the Supplement to the
HOME Scale for Impoverished Families (SHIF; Ertem et al., 1996). Further information on each
of these scales and the subdomains listed in Table 4 can be found in Appendix B.

84

Parental Interactions with Baby
Mothers were asked 16 questions (α = .74) relating to how often they did certain activities (e.g.,
singing songs, dancing, telling stories) with their baby. These items were taken from the My
Baby and Me program and Parenting for the First Time program (Centres for the Prevention of
Child Neglect, 2000). Answers were given on a 6 point scale ranging from 0 representing not at
all to 5 signifying more than once a day. A scale representing the frequency of the mother’s
interaction with her baby was created by taking an average of all responses, with higher scores
indicating more interaction.
Framingham Safety Survey
The PFL evaluation combined multiple measures to assess the safety of the physical
environment. Specifically, 20 of the 23 items on the birth to 12 month version of the
Framingham Safety Survey were used in the six month PFL interview and 15 of the 30 items on
the 1 to 4 year version were used in the 18 month PFL survey. These items were combined with
questions assessing the presence of five common safety items (e.g., safety gate) in the house.
Items are rated on a scale from zero to 10, with higher scores representing a safer environment.
An overall safety score is obtained by taking the average of all items.
Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment and Supplement to the HOME
Scale for Children Living in Impoverished Urban Environments
The Infant-Toddler version of the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment is a
45-item instrument completed by a trained interviewer. It measures the stimulation potential of
the child’s home environment, and may be used as a substitute for reliance on social class as an
indicator of quality of the child’s home environment. The HOME Inventory comprises six
domains. Responsivity (11 items) illustrates the degree to which a parent is responsive to the
child’s behaviour. Acceptance (8 items) represents parental acceptance of negative behaviour
from the child and avoidance of unnecessary punishment. Organisation (6 items) pertains to the
degree of routine in a family’s schedule, safety of the environment, and community supports
utilised. The learning materials domain (9 items) assesses the appropriateness of play materials
for the child. Involvement (6 items) illustrates the degree to which the parent is involved in the
child’s learning and promotes child development. Finally, the variety domain (5 items) assesses
visitation of people and attendance of activities that introduce variety into the child’s life. Each
item was scored by a trained interviewer as true or not. Items were scored based on observations
while in the home. For items where this was not possible, the mother is directly asked the
question in an interview format. If the item was true it is scored as a 1, if it is not true it is scored
as 0. Scores for each domain on the HOME Inventory were obtained by averaging the responses
to each question in that domain resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 1 with higher scores
indicating a more nurturing home environment.
The Supplement to the HOME Scale for Children Living in Impoverished Urban Environments
(SHIF; Ertem, Avni-Singer, & Forsyth, 1996) consists of 20 items that were combined with the
HOME Infant/Toddler Inventory and administered by a trained interviewer along with the
HOME Inventory. The SHIF was developed to be used in conjunction with the HOME
Infant/Toddler Inventory to provide a more suitable and accurate assessment of the home
environment of young children living in low socioeconomic urban areas. Additionally, four items
assessing child interaction with adult figures (not father figures) and the level of noise generated

85

inside and outside the house were added to this measure as they were thought to be particularly
relevant to low income populations. SHIF items, as well as these additional four items, are
scored in the same way as items on the HOME Inventory, with a score of one representing that
the statement is true and a zero representing that it is not true. In addition to the individual
HOME Inventory domains described above, a combined score using information from all
questions related to the home environment (e.g., HOME + SHIF) was used to form a composite
measure of stimulation in the home environment. The combined measure consists of 69 items, 45
from the HOME Inventory, 20 from the SHIF, and the four additional questions described above
which form eight subscales. Daily routines (10 items) contains items pertaining to the child’s
eating and sleeping patterns and the availability of food and safe sleeping facilities. Child care (5
items) provides details about the range, adequacy and appropriateness of childcare used by
parents. Outings (5 items) measures the variety of stimulation the child receives in the form of
trips made outside the home environment. Toys and books (10 items) measures the variety of
appropriate play and learning materials available to the child in the home environment. Play (10
items) contains items relating to stimulating interactions between the parent and the child, and
the parent’s conscious encouragement of the child’s development. Physical environment (10
items) is an observational subscale which contains items relating to cleanliness and safety in the
home, as well as the presence of literacy materials. Interaction (13 items) measures the parent’s
warmth and responsiveness in interacting with the child. Finally, restriction (6 items) measures
the level of restraint the parent places on the child during the visit, in the form of physical
punishment and scolding, as well as inappropriate handling by older children. Scores for each
domain were obtained by averaging the responses to each question in that domain. All calculated
scores range from 0 to 1 with higher scores indicating a more stimulating home environment. In
addition, a total SHIF score was obtained by summing the responses to 20 SHIF items, resulting
in a score ranging from 0 -20.

The Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) was used to measure IQ at 3 months postpartum. The Consideration of Future
Consequences (CFC) Scale is a measure of the extent to which people consider distant versus immediate consequences of possible
behaviours. Higher scores are indicative of more consideration for future consequences. The Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) was used
to measure the Big-Five Personality framework. Higher scores on the conscientiousness subdomain are indicative of more conscientious
behaviour. The Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI) measures approaches to parenting with higher scores indicating a lower risk
endorsement of abuse/neglect. AAPI cutoff scores are binary measures which indicate whether the participant was at risk of abuse/neglect.
