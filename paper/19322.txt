ABSTRACT
This paper provides empirical evidence on the causal effects that upgrading slum dwellings has on
the living conditions of the extremely poor. In particular, we study the impact of providing better houses
in situ to slum dwellers in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay. We experimentally evaluate the impact
of a housing project run by the NGO TECHO which provides basic pre-fabricated houses to members
of extremely poor population groups in Latin America. The main objective of the program is to improve
household well-being. Our findings show that better houses have a positive effect on overall housing
conditions and general well-being: treated households are happier with their quality of life. In two
countries, we also document improvements in children’s health; in El Salvador, slum dwellers also
feel that they are safer. We do not find this result, however, in the other two experimental samples.
There are no other noticeable robust effects on the possession of durable goods or in terms of labor
outcomes. Our results are robust in terms of both internal and external validity because they are derived
from similar experiments in three different Latin American countries.

1. Introduction
The 1948 United Nation Universal Declaration of Human Rights identified housing, along with
food and clothing, as a basic requirement for achieving an adequate standard of living. 1 Despite
this, almost one billion people, primarily in the developing world, live in urban slums and lack
proper housing (United Nations, 2003).2 Most slum dwellers live in houses with dirt floors,
poor-quality roofs, and walls constructed out of waste materials such as cardboard, tin and
plastic. These houses do not provide proper protection against inclement weather, are not
secure and are not pleasant to live in. Many have insufficient access to services such as clean
water, sanitation and electricity (UN-Habitat, 2003 and Marx et al., 2013).
Housing is one of the largest expenditures that a family makes and it a superior good, inasmuch
as the share of income spent on housing typically increases disproportionately as income rises.
Adequate housing provides a number of benefits. First, families live and spend a large amount
of time in their houses. Houses are one of the few places that families can use for rest and
relaxation. As such, housing quality contributes substantially to well-being, quality of life and
mental health. A proper house can induce a sense of dignity and pride (Sen, 1999). In fact,
Cattaneo et al. (2009) and Devoto et al. (2011) have shown how specific housing improvements
such as better floors and access to water have resulted in increased satisfaction with quality of
life and better mental health. Second, adequate housing can promote physical health by
providing protection against the ravages of the environment. Roofs and walls shelter one from
rain and from the cold. Water, sanitation and non-dirt floors protect against parasitic
infestations and infections. Finally, housing may provide security and serve as a defense against
crime, a major problem in slums (United Nations, 2003). Thus, proper housing may allow
households to accumulate assets, as well as free up time for use in more productive activities
that would otherwise be devoted to protecting assets.

In line with previous work, we define a slum as an overcrowded settlement which has poor-quality
housing, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, and insecurity of tenure (UN-Habitat, 2003).

This paper provides some of the first experimental evidence regarding the causal effects of
upgrading dwellings on the living conditions of extremely poor persons in slums. We examine
the impact of inexpensive but sturdy houses constructed by TECHO, an NGO that provides basic
pre-fabricated houses to extremely poor populations in Latin America. TECHO targets the
poorest informal settlements and, within these settlements, the families who live in extremely
substandard housing. TECHO houses are a significant improvement over existing housing units
in terms of their flooring, roofs and walls. While the TECHO houses are substantial
improvement over the pre-existing dwellings, they do not have indoor sanitation facilities,
running water or kitchens.
In this paper, we use experimentally generated variation to assess the effects of upgraded
housing on living conditions in three Latin American countries: El Salvador, Mexico and
Uruguay. Our findings show that the better structures have a positive effect on overall housing
conditions and general well-being: treated households are happier and more satisfied with the
quality of their lives. This is a dimension of social policy that is often overlooked but is crucial to
the “life experience” of poor people and, thus, should be taken into account whenever
evaluating housing programs like TECHO. In two countries, El Salvador and Mexico, we also
document improvements in children’s health, while, in El Salvador, slum dwellers’ perception of
their safety and security also improves. There are, however, no robust noticeable effects on the
possession of durable goods or in terms of employment outcomes.
Any causal study must overcome both internal and external threats to its validity (see Campbell,
1957, and Cook and Campbell, 1979). Most research is focused on addressing threats to
internal validity; i.e., on ensuring that the estimated effects are “causal” within the context of
the study population. External validity, in contrast, refers to the extent to which the estimated
effects can be applied to other populations in different settings and at different times.
Ultimately, external validity is established by replication in multiple data sets drawn from a
variety of settings (Angrist, 2004).3 Our results are unusually robust in terms of both internal
and external validity because they are derived from experiments in three different Latin
3

See Cruces and Galiani (2007) for an application of this idea in the context of a quasi-experiment on
the effect of fertility on maternal labor supply.
3

American countries and we are therefore able to identify casual results that are robust across
countries.4
Despite the importance of housing, however, very little evidence exists on the causal effects of
housing programs. Our findings constitute a contribution to the small body of literature on this
subject.5 To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first randomized experiment
undertaken to assess the impact of upgrading housing infrastructure in slums in the developing
world.6 Previous contributions include Katz et al. (2001), who analyzed the results of a program
that randomly offered vouchers to poor slum dwellers in the U.S. that allowed them to relocate
to areas with lower poverty rates. Voucher recipients experienced improvements in some
indicators of well-being, including safety, health and the prevalence of behavioral problems
among boys. Kling et al. (2004) exploited the same experiment and found a reduction in arrests
of young people for violent crimes and of young females for property crimes, but also found
increased behavioral problems and property crime in the case of young males. Cattaneo et al.
(2009) exploited a natural experiment that showed that replacing dirt floors with cement floors
in urban areas of Mexico has a positive impact on child health, maternal mental health, and
satisfaction with quality of life. Finally, Devoto et al. (2011) studied the effects of randomly
offering credit to finance household connections to the water distribution system in urban
Morocco. While they do not find significant health effects, they do find a significant
improvement in self-reported well-being.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the intervention. Section
3 presents the experimental design. In Section 4 we introduce the econometric methods used

4

While external validity is evaluated in terms of the direction and statistical significance of the effects of
the intervention, the size of the effects could well be different across settings because the
counterfactuals might also differ across settings.

See Marx et al. (2013) for a survey on the economics of slums, Jaitman (2012) for a literature review
on slum upgrading programs, and Duflo et al. (2012a) on urban services.

There are also a large number of cross-sectional observational studies that point to the existence of
strong associations between poor housing and indicators of poor health (see Thomson et al., 2001, for a
review).

lives in slums and offer some insights on the formation of slums. Finally, section 7 concludes.

2. Upgrading Housing Infrastructure
TECHO provides basic pre-fabricated houses to extremely poor families living informal
settlements (slums) in Latin America with the objective of improving well-being. It started up
seventeen years ago in Chile and now works in 19 Latin American countries. The NGO has built
almost 100,000 houses with the help of an army of volunteers. Every year more than 20,000
youth throughout Latin America volunteer to work with TECHO.7
The locations of the settlements in El Salvador are somewhat different than in the other 2
countries. In El Salvador TECHO works in poor areas scattered throughout the country, but
excludes the primary urban center of San Salvador. In contrast, the TECHO intervention sites
are concentrated closer to largest urban centers in the other two countries. In Mexico, this
includes slums in Estado de Mexico located adjacent to Mexico City, and in Uruguay, slums
located in and around Montevideo and Canelones.
TECHO targets the poorest informal settlements and the households within these settlements
that live in very substandard dwellings. TECHO serves “irregular settlements,” defined as
communities comprised of families that inhabit plots of land that they do not own. Settlements
are plagued by a host of problems such as insufficient access to basic services (water, electricity
and sanitation), significant levels of soil and water contamination, and overcrowding. The
typical housing units in these informal settlements are no better than their surroundings, as

7

While the work primarily involves building homes, over 3,500 regular volunteers also commit at least
one day a week to community organization and participating in social inclusion programs. This second
phase of the intervention aims at developing skills through the implementation of these inclusive
programs. Our study focuses on evaluating the impact of the first phase of the program: the
construction of transitional housing. We limit the evaluation sample frame to settlements that did not
receive the services provided during the second phase of the intervention so that no intervention other
than the construction of housing took place in the settlements studied during the period of analysis.
5

they are rudimentary units constructed from discarded materials such as cardboard, tin and
plastic, have dirt floors and lack connections to basic services such as water and sewer systems.
The TECHO housing units are 18 squared meters (6m by 3m) in size. The walls are made of prefabricated, insulated pinewood panels or aluminum and the roofs are made of tin to keep
occupants warm and protect them from humidity, insects, and rain.8 Floors are built on top of
15 stacks that raise it up to between 30 and 80 centimeters off the ground in order to reduce
dampness and protect occupants from floods and infestations. Although these houses are a
major improvement over the recipients’ previous housing situation, the facilities they offer are
limited, as they do not include a bathroom or kitchen or amenities such as plumbing, drinking
water hook-ups, or gas connections.
The houses are designed to be low cost and easy to construct. Units are modular and portable,
are constructed with simple tools, and are set up by volunteers working in squads of 4-8
members. The cost of a Techo house is less than $1,000, of which the beneficiary family
contributes 10%. In El Salvador, this is approximately equivalent to 3 months’ earnings, while in
Mexico and Uruguay, it is roughly equivalent to 1.4 months. The following images show
examples of the TECHO houses built in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay.

Mexico and Uruguay

8

In El Salvador, floors are made of cement, and walls and roofs are made of aluminum. In Mexico and
Uruguay, floors and walls are made of wood, while roofs are made of aluminum.
6

The houses are also easy to disassemble and move to a new location. It is important for the
houses to be movable because most of the families in these makeshift settlements do not have
formal title to the land that they live on. TECHO managers were concerned that upgrading the
value of the land by building permanent housing might induce both public and private owners
to try to force residents to move in order to reclaim the improved land. However, by making
the housing mobile, there is no such incentive.9

3. Experimental Design
TECHO budget and personnel constraints limit the number of housing units that can be built at
any one time.10 Under these constraints, TECHO opted to select beneficiaries through a lottery
system giving all eligible households in a pre-determined geographical neighborhood an equal
opportunity to receive the housing upgrade in a given year. We exploit this experimental
variability to assess the impact of improved housing living conditions.
TECHO first selected a set of eligible settlements and then conducted a census to identify
eligible households (i.e., those poor enough to be given priority). The eligible households were
then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Since TECHO did not have the
capacity to work in all settlements at once, the program was rolled out in each country in two
phases.11 Random assignment was performed within each settlement on a rolling basis.12, 13

9

A more comprehensive slum upgrading program would likely be preceded by a land titling program
(see, among others, Field, 2005, and Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2010).

10

This also constrained the size of the sample used in our study in each country.

11

See Supplemental Appendix Table A1 for the dates of each phase and follow-up survey in each
country.

12

In El Salvador and Uruguay, some settlements were randomly assigned a higher intensity-of-treatment
level. However, due to the small number of clusters, mostly, we do not exploit this feature in our
analysis.
13

Within each settlement every household had the same probability of being chosen for inclusion in the
intention-to-treat group, but this was not necessarily the case across settlements.
7

Baseline surveys were conducted approximately one month before the start of each phase, and
the follow-up surveys were between 19 and 29 months after construction (See Supplemental
Appendix Table A1). In order to obtain truthful information from households and to avoid
creating any desirability bias in the treatment group, the data collection was separated from
the implementation of the intervention by contracting a highly respected survey firm in each
country. The enumerators identified themselves as collecting data for a study on living
conditions and did not make any reference to TECHO verbally or in written form. All surveys
included modules on socioeconomic characteristics, the labor market, assets, security, health
and self-reported measures of satisfaction. (Supplemental Appendix tables A2a, A2b, and A2c
provide details on the variables in the analyses).
Our sample includes 23 settlements in El Salvador, 39 settlements in Mexico and 12 in Uruguay.
The total number of eligible households in these settlements was 2,373 split approximately
evenly across the 3 countries. Treatment was offered to 60% of the households in El Salvador,
51% in Mexico and 61% in Uruguay (See Supplemental Appendix Table A3).14 In all, over 85% of
the households in the intention-to-treat groups complied with the treatment assignment, while
the compliance rates for the non-intention-to-treat groups were practically perfect. Finally, we
attempted to track all of households that migrated out of the study settlements, but could find
and interview only a fraction of them. Attrition rates from the sample are between 5.5% and
7% of households in the intention-to-treat group and 6.3% to 8.7% of those in the nonintention-to-treat group. Though the attrition rates are about one percentage point higher in
the non-intention-to-treat group in all three countries, the differences are not statistically
significant at conventional levels.

14

Note, however, that the number of individuals, as measured in the follow-up survey, increased in
almost all groups and samples. Among the households interviewed in the follow up survey, a large
fraction of the new members are children below 2 years old. The rest is mainly account by other children
of the head of the household not present at the house at the time we collected the respective baseline
survey.

3.1.

Experimental Group Balance

Under randomization, the outcomes of the intention- and non-intention-to-treat groups should
be equal, on average, prior to treatment. In Supplemental Appendix Tables A4a and A4b, we
present summary statistics separately for the intention- and non-intention-to-treat groups on a
large set of pre-treatment variables grouped as socioeconomic characteristics, housing
characteristics, assets, satisfaction with quality of housing and life, security, education and
health. We also report robust standard errors and test for the null hypothesis of no difference
between the mean values of each variable for each experimental group. Given that the
randomization of units between experimental groups occurred within each settlement, we
expect them to be well-balanced once we control for settlement fixed effects. Thus, when
testing the null hypothesis of no differences between the two groups, we control by settlement
fixed effects.
The analysis indicates that the design is well balanced, since, in Mexico and El Salvador, only 2
out of 44 variables are unbalanced at the 10% significance level, while, in Uruguay, six variables
appear to be unbalanced at conventional levels. Finally, in the combined three experiments,
only 4 out of 44 variables are statistically different between groups at conventional levels. This
is about what would be expected by chance. 15,16

Baseline Cross-Country Housing Differences

A major strength of this study is that it provides an evaluation of the same intervention in three
different populations and environments. Mexico and Uruguay are much richer than El Salvador.
The PPP Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in 2007 was USD 12,580 in Mexico, USD 11,020
15

The analysis remains almost unchanged if we instead cluster the standard errors at the settlement
level while still including settlement fixed effects. We find only three variables unbalanced in El Salvador,
four in Mexico and Uruguay, and only three variables in the combined three experimental samples.
These results are available upon request.

16

Without controlling for settlement fixed effects, we find that, in Uruguay, only two variables appear to
be statistically unbalanced; in Mexico, six variables are unbalanced, but in El Salvador as many as eight
variables are unbalanced at the 10% level of statistical significance. Overall, in the combined three
samples, six variables are unbalanced at conventional levels of statistical significance. These results are
available upon request.
9

in Uruguay compared to USD 5,640 in El Salvador. These differences are reflected in housing
and as such influence the estimated impacts of dwelling upgrades on outcomes. Therefore, a
comparison of the baseline housing characteristics is an important input for the interpretation
of our results as these provide the counterfactuals estimates for the treatment effects.
In Table A5, we highlight a set of 11 housing characteristics measured at baseline in all of the
countries and test the null hypothesis of no difference between the mean values of each
variable by country. Baseline housing was, as is to be expected, substantially better in Mexico
and Uruguay than in El Salvador. For example, in Mexico 64.9% of households had high-quality
floors, while in Uruguay the corresponding figure was 37.2% and in El Salvador it was only
14.4%. In Uruguay and Mexico, a large percentage of households had electricity (95.9% and
83.8%, respectively) and some form of water connection (91.3% and 51.0%, respectively),
while, in El Salvador, only 39.1% of households had electricity and 21.5% of them had some sort
of water hook-up on the property.

4. Methods
We report estimates of the average intention-to-treat effect for the outcomes of interest. Given
the high compliance rate, these parameters are very close to average treatment effects.
Operationally, we estimate the following regression model:

Yij     Intention to Treat ij   X ij   j   ij

(1)

where i indexes households or individuals, j indexes settlements, Yij is any of the outcomes
under study, and  is the parameter of interest (i.e., the coefficient associated to a dummy
variable that equals 1 for the households or individuals that were experimentally allocated to
treatment, and 0 otherwise) on the outcome under consideration,17 Xij is a vector of pre-

17

Some of the variables under study are limited dependent variables (LDVs). The problem posed by
causal inference with LDVs is not fundamentally different from the problem of causal inference with
10

treatment characteristics measured at baseline, μj is a settlement fixed effect, and ij is the
error term. The settlement fixed effects capture the average unobservable differences across
settlements that may exist given that randomization was conducted within each settlement.
Controlling for settlement fixed effects, we assume that the error terms are independent and
report only robust standard errors throughout the empirical section of the analysis.18
In studies with multiple outcomes, statistically significant effects may emerge simply by chance.
The larger the number of tests, the higher is the likelihood of incurring in a type I error. We
correct for this possibility by using Bonferroni Family-Wise Error Rates (FWER) to adjust the pvalues of the individual tests as a function of the number of outcome variables. We compute
Bonferroni FWER corrections at the 10 percent level of statistical significance by dividing the
desired size of the test by the number of outcome variables in conceptually similar blocks of
outcomes grouped by table and country experiment.
We also follow Kling et al. (2007) to construct summary indexes by family group. We first
impute missing values using the mean of the settlement by intention-to-treat status. Then, we
standardize each outcome variable by subtracting the mean value of the control group and by
dividing by its standard deviation. Finally, the summary index is computed as the sum of
standardized outcome variables in the group with the sign of each measure oriented so that
more beneficial outcomes have higher scores divided by the number of outcome variables.
These summary indexes, aggregating information across related outcomes, are not only useful
summary statistics but might also improve the statistical power to detect effects of the

continuous outcomes. If there are no covariates or the covariates are sparse and discrete, linear models
are no less appropriate for LDVs than for other types of dependent variables. This is certainly the case in
a randomized control trial where controls are included only in order to improve efficiency, but their
omission would not bias the estimates of the parameters of interest.
18

The statistical inference of the results reported in the next section are robust to clustering the
standard errors at the settlement level in that rejection decisions of the null hypothesis of no effect
remain the same at conventional levels of statistical significance. This result renders credibility to our
assumption that the settlement fixed effect captures the systematic unobserved differences across
slums. These results are available upon request.
11

intervention that are consistent across groups of outcomes when they have idiosyncratic
variation.
Finally, standard statistical corrections to attempt to control the type-I error rate of a test, such
as the Bonferroni correction, are more important in the context of an experiment where there
is little other information used in the analysis than the one about the randomization of
treatment status. Our study departs from that paradigm in that it reports effects of three
independent samples and hence, we can rely on the information of these independent samples
to reassure ourselves of the validity of our inference. In that sense, in the next section, we will
tend to emphasize more the sets of results that we obtain in all three samples.

5. Results
In this section we report the estimated effects of TECHO houses on several outcome variables
of interest, including dwelling quality, satisfaction with the house and quality of life, security,
assets, labor supply and child health. We report the results of estimating equation (1) for two
different specifications –one with and one without a set of control variables that are listed in
the notes to the tables. In each table, we first present the results for Models 1 and 2 for each
country separately and then present the estimates for the parameter of interest in these two
models for a pooled sample that includes the three experiments. These estimates provide an
informative “average” summary of the results across all 3 countries and also are likely to be
more precisely estimated. At the bottom of each table we report the effect on the aggregated
summary index for all indicators. Finally, we still report conventional significance levels in the
traditional manner in the tables and the corresponding Bonferroni FWER adjusted p-value for
each group in the table notes.
5.1 Housing
We begin by first demonstrating that the provision of a TECHO house had an impact on the
quality of housing. This is a necessary condition in order for this intervention to have any
impact on the other outcomes. In addition, we test whether families invested further in their
12

house. Better houses may also provide incentives to invest in further housing improvements,
since such investments may be associated with other complementarities (see, among others,
Banerjee and Duflo, 2011). Generally, we find that TECHO has had a large positive effect on the
quality of housing but no more than that.
In Table 1a we present the results for the effects of the program on housing quality. As
expected, the program resulted in substantial improvements in the quality of floors, walls and
roofs, as well as in the percentage of rooms with windows. TECHO substantially improved
overall housing as reflected in the program effect on the housing quality summary index. Since
baseline housing conditions were worse in El Salvador than in Uruguay and Mexico, the
program’s absolute effects are consistently larger in the first case than in the others. Still, in all
cases the effects are large both in absolute and in relative terms. All the estimated effects but
those for number of rooms remain significant after adjusting the p-values for multiple
outcomes. Nevertheless, the increase in the number of rooms remains statistically significant in
the case of Mexico and also in the combined analysis across the three experiments.
In Table 1b we investigate whether the improvement in the house as a result of the
intervention triggered further investments by the beneficiary families. We find that the
program did not induce positive significant complementary investments among beneficiaries. In
particular, there are no positive effects on access to water, electricity or sanitation. If anything,
we find that two out of the five outcomes studied are negatively affected in the case Mexico at
conventional levels of statistical significance. In one case, significance is lost when contrasted
with the Bonferroni adjusted p-values. These results are consistent with households not holding
land titles and hence lacking incentives to invest.
5.2 Satisfaction with house and quality of life
Table 2 presents the program’s effects on ordinal self-reported measures of satisfaction with
the housing unit as well as with an overall self-reported measure of quality of life. In all
countries, all measures substantially increased. Families are happier with their houses and with

13

their lives.19 The gains are substantially larger in El Salvador20 than in Mexico and Uruguay,
which is consistent with the fact that the improvement in housing conditions is greater in the
first case than in the other two.21 The index that measures satisfaction with the quality of
floors, for example, is over 200% higher in households in the treatment group with respect to
the control group in El Salvador, while in Mexico the index is around 20% higher in the
intention-to-treat households than in the control-group households, and in Uruguay the
differential is around 39%. Similarly, satisfaction with quality of life is 41% higher in the
intention-to-treat households in El Salvador, while in Mexico the figure is around 28% and in
Uruguay it is around 21%.
5.3 Security and safety
Security is one of the most important concerns of urban slum dwellers. Information from our
baseline survey shows that overall 38% of the heads of household often or always felt unsafe
and 54% felt unsafe when leaving their homes alone. In this sense, it could be argued that
providing a better house could potentially make people feel safer.
In Table 3 we present the results of the program in terms of several measures of security
related to housing. We report the effect of the program on the perception of security: whether
people feel safe inside the house, whether they feel that it is safe to leave the house alone,
whether it seems safe to leave children alone in the house and whether the house has been
burglarized. All the questions refer to the preceding year. Our estimations show that, in El
Salvador, all self-reported measures of security improve substantially. The increase in the index
19

In order to interpret better these results, it is important to note that for all variables considered in this
section and all experimental samples, the average outcome for the control group never decreased
between the baseline and treatment measures.
20
Due to a problem with data collection in the follow-up survey in El Salvador, non-response to this
question was differentially larger for the control group. Thus, to be on the safe side, we impute a value
equal to 1 ("satisfied with quality of life") to 84 missing values in control group observations, which
reduces the non-response rate for this variable from 43% to 7%, the same as in the intention-to-treat
group. Without performing this imputation, the coefficient is 0.479 for Model 1 and 0.480 for Model 2.
21

Qualitatively, the results of this section are robust to the estimation of an ordered Probit model. The
probability of being in the highest (or second highest) satisfaction category always increases with
treatment and the marginal effect is always statistically significant at conventional levels. These results
are available upon request.
14

for security inside the house is around 27% and the improvement is about 57% in the index that
measures whether it is safe to leave children alone, but no such effect is detected in Uruguay or
Mexico. We do not find that the program has any effect on crime, however, as there are no
statistically significant reported changes in the frequency of burglaries during the past year in
any of the three countries; it is also true, however, that, in El Salvador and Mexico, burglary
rates in the settlements in our sample were very low and hence the exercise is not very
informative.
5.4 Possession of durable goods
There are different ways in which housing conditions can influence the possession of durable
goods. On the one hand, if a better house provides security to those who live in it, then it will
also provide more security for the assets inside it. Thus, dwellers can invest more in buying
durable goods. On the other hand, having an improved house can also increase the valuation of
some durable goods and, thus, stimulate their acquisition.
Table 4 depicts the performance of different variables corresponding to the possession of
assets. We estimate the effect of the program on the possession of TV sets, fans, gas stoves,
refrigerators and bicycles. The results show, however, that the program has had no effect on
the possession of any of these assets. In other words, at least during the period studied, we do
not find that the treated households have responded to the investment in their houses by
increasing their own investments in supplementary durable goods.
5.5 Household Structure and Labor Outcomes
In this subsection we present the results of our analysis with respect to household structure
and labor outcomes. We first estimate whether the improved housing has had any effect on the
number of members residing in each house and find no statistically significant effects on this
front. We also investigate whether, in this limited period of time, there has been any effect on
fertility by estimating whether the treatment has influenced the number of newborns in the
housing units, but, here again, we do not identify any significant effects (see Table 5a).22
22

In Uruguay, and only for model 2, the number of newborns in the last two years is statistically
significant at conventional levels but the significance disappears once the test is contrasted against the
15

We then estimate whether the improved housing, either directly or indirectly, stimulates labor
supply and earnings (in particular, the income per capita of the household and whether either
the head of household or the spouse works more). As can be seen from the tables, we do not
detect significant effects on any of these outcomes. We can conclude that better housing, at
least in the way that it is provided by the TECHO program, has no effect on the labor outcomes
of the treated households (see Table 5b).23
5.6 Child Health
The reasons why better housing can lead to an improvement in the health of the persons living
in those houses are clear. For instance, dirt floors generally pose a serious threat to children’s
health. In the study carried out by Cattaneo et al. (2009) concerning the replacement of dirt
floors with cement floors, the authors found a statistically significant reduction in the incidence
of parasitic infections, diarrhea and the prevalence of anemia. Another way in which housing
improvements can support health is the reduction in indoor air pollution. Duflo et al. (2012b)
have shown that improper ventilation of houses and the use of substandard kitchen stoves can
have significantly negative effects on respiratory –and even general- health. The houses
provided by the TECHO program provide better ventilation than most of the slum dwellings do
and may therefore have a positive effect on overall health as well.
In Table 6 we test whether the upgraded houses result in an improvement in child health; the
indicators used for this purpose are the prevalence of diarrhea and of respiratory disease. The
estimated coefficients are mainly negative in both El Salvador and Mexico, suggesting that
there may have been a decrease in the prevalence of those illnesses due to the intervention,
adjusted p-value for multiple comparisons. We also tested whether treatment affected the age structure
of the household, given that we have detected some changes in household size, by estimating Models 1
and 2 for the four age categories reported in Appendix Table A4b. We did not find any significant effect
at conventional levels. These results are available upon request.
23

We also explored whether treatment affected education attainment, measured by the maximum
years of schooling completed as reported in Appendix Table A4b for children 6 to 12 (primary school)
and 13 to 18 years old (secondary school). Overall, we did not find any significant effect. We only
detected a small negative effect in Mexico for children 13 to 18 years old but this variable was
unbalanced at baseline for this group in this sample in the same direction and magnitude that the
detected effect. Instead, in Uruguay, for the same age group, we did find a positive and statistically
significant small effect. These results are also available upon request.
16

but this is not the case in Uruguay. However, given our sample sizes, the estimated coefficients
are imprecisely estimated and hence are not statistically significant at conventional levels. The
point estimates, though, show a large decrease in diarrhea both in Mexico and in El Salvador.24
As a result, the overall effect, pooling across countries, is still large (a decrease of approximately
18% with a p-value equal to 0.17).25 If we assume that the effect is not present in Uruguay
because, there, the experiment took place in a better, more urbanized environment where
people have greater access to services, then the pooled effect in the other two countries,
reported in the two last columns of the table, point to an even larger effect, of approximately
27%, which is statistically significant at the 10% level. In contrast, we do not find significant
evidence that would allow us to conclude that there is a large effect in terms of the reduction
of the prevalence of respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, the health summary index is also
statistically significant at the 5% level for those two countries together.26

6. Who Lives in Slums
The most robust result so far appears to be that upgrading dwelling infrastructural has large
impacts on quality of life measured by satisfaction. This is despite conventional explanations
that attribute the emergence of slums to the fact that the poor are willing to live in substandard
housing in polluted or floodable areas or on slopes, ridges and other inhospitable geographical
environments if they also could be close to employment opportunities in the city center (see,

24

In both cases, the percentage changes are larger than the one estimated by Cattaneo et al. (2008)
though the treatments nor the compliance rates are comparable between studies.
25

We also interacted the intention-to-treat dummy variable with a dummy indicating whether, in the
samples of El Salvador and Uruguay, the settlement was randomized to a high intensity treatment level.
The interaction was never found statistically significant at conventional levels whether the standard
errors were clustered or not at the settlement level. These results are also available upon request.

26

Since this analysis is based on a set of assumptions, we do not contrast these results with the adjusted
p-values, though the effect on the summary index would remain significant under this more stringent
contrast.
17

for example, Glaeser, 2011).27 Slum dwellers may have a strong preference for being close to
the labor market –so strong that it may offset any kind of disadvantage that living in an
irregular settlement may entail.
In this section, we provide some evidence to support the hypothesis that slum and non-slum
dwellers have different preferences for income and housing. In Tables 7a to 7f, we compare a
large number of outcomes of interest in regard to the slum population using information from
the national household surveys of El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay on the poor and non-poor
populations in the same geographical areas as our TECHO samples.28 The first column of each
table shows the mean of the variable of interest for the poor population and the second for the
slum dwellers targeted by TECHO. The third column shows the differential between the
outcomes for the poor and the slum dwellers. For El Salvador and Mexico, we also show in the
fourth column what the differential is once we control for a dummy that indicates whether the
household is in a rural or urban area. In those cases, our preferred estimate of the differentials
is the one shown in this last column of each table.
The first salient aspect of the comparison is that, in all three countries, slum dwellers are in
general even worse-off in terms of assets than other poor populations. For instance, the share
of rooms with good-quality floors is 14% among slum inhabitants compared to 61% for the poor
population of El Salvador overall. In Mexico and Uruguay, the share of rooms with good-quality
floors among the non-slum poor is 20 percentage points greater than it is for slum dwellers.
Rates for water connections, access to toilets and sewerage systems, and possession of
27

In fact, for example, one of the reasons mentioned by Banerjee et al. (2008) for the rise of
unemployment in South Africa after the end of apartheid in 1994 is the high cost of job searches for the
black population, since the country’s persistent geographical racial segregation has confined blacks to
areas far away from the city center, which is also hard to reach due to the unavailability of good public
transportation. The end of apartheid thus resulted in an increase in the labor supply among the black
population that, in light of high job-search costs, could not find a match in labor demand.
28

In the case of Uruguay, the national survey enables us to distinguish between poor slum dwellers and
poor groups not living in slum conditions. This is rather unique, since in general, household surveys have
very low coverage of slums settlements, if any (see, among others, Marx et al., 2013), and hence, we use
that national survey for the analysis in this section though restricting it to the geographical areas
covered in our study. Instead, in El Salvador and Mexico, the information for slum dwellers comes
exclusively from our baseline survey.
18

refrigerators and TV sets are all significantly higher for the average poor household of El
Salvador and Mexico than for slum dwellers in the same country. In Uruguay, the differences
are smaller –in part because the average rates are much higher among this highly urban
population.
In Uruguay and Mexico, however, the incomes of slum dwellers are higher than the incomes of
poor non-slum dwellers. In Mexico, the slum dwellers included in our baseline survey earn, on
average, USD 108 per month per capita, while the average income for the poor population is
USD 86 – a difference of 25%. In Uruguay, slum dwellers earn an impressive 71% more than
poor non-slum dwellers, and the difference between men’s and women’s incomes is also
significant in both countries. Consequently, the question that naturally arises is how we can
explain why slum dwellers earn more but live in much worse housing units. Not only are
monthly incomes higher, but also the wage incomes of slum dwellers are significantly higher
than those of the rest of the poor population. The difference amounts to approximately 40% in
Uruguay and 30% in Mexico when we average the wage differentials for both men and women.
El Salvador is different that than Mexico and Uruguay. In economic terms, the TECHO
households in El Salvador are much more disadvantaged in all respects. In this case, the labor
market outcomes of slum dwellers are worse than those of the poor not living in slums.
However, educational attainment of heads households and school enrollment rates of their
children are also worse in slums. This may have to do with the fact that many moved to slums in
El Salvador to escape violent civil conflict as opposed to seeing economic opportunity. As such,
this type of person who moved to a slum would be different in El Salvador compared to Mexico
and Uruguay where the main motive was economic opportunity.
The results seem to be consistent with the existence of poor groups with different preferences.
We find that, while slum dwellers have clearly worse housing infrastructure than the rest of the
poor population, they earn significantly more than poor people living in non-slum areas even
though they have the same levels of human capital. There appears to be an intrinsic “selection”
among the poor: those who prefer to have good access to the labor market in cities tend to
gather in slums, while those who are less willing to do so live in better environments, although
at a significant cost in terms of income. Moving forward, an understanding of these differences
19

will be crucial in improving the design of policies for upgrading the living conditions of the
urban poor.

7. Conclusion
This paper provides an analysis of the impact of providing better houses in situ to slum dwellers
in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay. As expected, the quality of housing greatly improves after
the intervention. Subsequently, satisfaction with housing and with the quality of life increases
drastically. This is a very significant result since it suggests that limited in situ improvements in
the housing of poor families has a large effect on their overall well-being. This finding is
consistent with those of Cattaneo et. al (2009) and Devoto et. al (2011) and highlights the
importance of using subjective indicators to evaluate interventions such as housing
improvement programs, where the main objective is to facilitate the quality of family and social
interactions. Thus, we conclude that the type house is an important input in a household’s
utility function irrespective of whether they affect other material outcomes. Our results show
that, as in the case of the interventions analyzed by Cattaneo et al. (2009) and Devoto et al.
(2011), improvements in housing conditions have a clearly positive effect on the satisfaction
and well-being of poor slum dwellers.
Additionally, also in line with Cattaneo et al. (2009), we find that the improved housing
conditions lead to large reductions in the incidence of diarrhea, at least in two of the three
experiments. The one case in which these improvements do not seem to have health effects is
the one in which the experiment took place in a better, more urbanized environment in which
services are more accessible.
The provision of better housing has virtually no other statistically significant effects.
Perceptions of security and safety change for the better only in El Salvador, while there is no
change in the other two countries. In all three countries, better housing has little or no effect
on further housing investments to supplement the upgrading intervention, the possession of
durable goods, household structure or labor outcomes.

20

In this study we also compare slum dwellers to the rest of the poor population in the areas
analyzed. When we consider the slum dwellers’ situation within their national contexts, it
becomes possible to shed some light on their housing decisions and the dynamics of slum
formation. We find that slum dwellers have clearly worse housing infrastructure than poor nonslum dwellers. However, in the more urban areas, the slum dwellers earn significantly more
than other poor households and have comparable levels of educational attainment and labormarket participation outcomes. These findings are consistent with the plausible explanation for
slum formation as a consequence of some poor groups being more willing to trade off living
conditions for better access to the labor market. These poor households choose to live in
substandard dwellings in slum areas because they tend to be closer to production activities
than other parts of urban conglomerates. At the same time, other poor people are less willing
to do so and therefore live in better environments but at a significant cost in terms of their
income. The existence of these two types of poor households with different preferences should
be taken into account when designing housing policies.

These findings contribute inputs for the debate about slum upgrading initiatives. What emerges
from our analysis is that the provision of the kind of in situ housing upgrade that we studied in
this paper has some significant effects on the living conditions of slum dwellers but that those
effects are perhaps not as large as society might wish or expect. At first glance, the conclusion
to be drawn from this finding might be that in situ upgrading should be ruled out and priority
should be given to geographic relocation policies. This conclusion could, however, be in error.
First of all, the in situ intervention is fairly inexpensive and substantially increases life
satisfaction. What is more, in the two countries where we detect a reduction in the incidence of
diarrhea, the effects are quite large. Additionally, Cattaneo et al. (2006) analyzed the
performance of the Mexican “Iniciamos Tu Casa” program, which provided new houses to poor
inhabitants. These houses were located far from the city center. A year after the program had
started, the authors found that a large proportion of the participants had abandoned the
houses; moreover, those who remained in them mentioned that, although housing conditions
were better, the new neighborhoods provided them with poor access to public goods and
21

general infrastructure. In situ upgrading therefore appears to remain a valid policy choice. This
is also consistent with the evidence presented in Takeuchi et al. (2008) for Mumbai. These
authors use a residential location model to assess the welfare of an in situ slum upgrade
program and a slum relocation program and conclude that, at least for those households
relocated to more remote locations, the disadvantages of changes in commute distance wipe
out the housing benefits of the program and that the treated households would have been
better off if they had been given access to the more limited housing improvements provided by
the in situ intervention. This is also consistent with the evidence that we present in Section 4,
where we show that, as noted above, at least in urban areas, poor households are willing to
trade off housing conditions for better access to labor markets and, hence, higher earnings.

Responses regarding construction materials used in rooms were included only for those households that reported information for all rooms. All the reggresions have a dummy by caserio.
Model 1: No Controls; Model 2: Control for HH's Years of Schooling, HH's Gender, HH's Age, Assets - Value Per Capita (USD), Monthly Income Per Capita (USD), all measured during the
baseline round. Following the standard procedure, when a control variable has a missing value, we impute a value equal to 0 and add a dummy variable equal to 1 for that observation, which
indicates that the control variable was missed. The Housing Investment Summary Index (z-score) is defined as the average of the z-scores of all the variables in the table, with the sign of each
measure oriented so that the more beneficial outcomes have higher scores. Bonferroni corrected p-value=0.02 for a significance level of 0.1. Reported results: estimated coefficient, robust
standard error, p-value and 100*coefficient/follow-up control mean, in that order.
*Significant at 10% level. **Significant at 5% level. ***Significant at 1% level.

All the reggresions have a dummy by caserio. Model 1: No Controls; Model 2: Control for HH's Years of Schooling, HH's Gender, HH's Age, Assets - Value Per Capita
(USD), Monthly Income Per Capita (USD), all measured during the baseline round. Following the standard procedure, when a control variable has a missing value, we
impute a value equal to 0 and add a dummy variable equal to 1 for that observation, which indicates that the control variable was missed. The Assets Summary Index (zscore) is defined is defined as the average of the z-scores of all the variables in the table, with the sign of each measure oriented so that the more beneficial outcomes
have higher scores. Bonferroni corrected p-value=0.02 for a significance level of 0.1. Reported results: estimated coefficient, robust standard error, p-value and
100*coefficient/follow-up control mean, in that order.

Figures computed at household and individual levels in El Salvador using the 2008 multi-purpose household survey
for all provinces (known as "departments") in which there are UTPMP households (excludes San Salvador Department)
and UTPMP impact evaluation baseline data sources. Standard errors are clustered at the primary sample unit level
shown in parentheses.
b

The term "national poor "refers to households whose members were living on less than USD 89.4 per capita per
month in urban zones and less than USD 58.2 per capita per month in rural zones in 2008; these figures are equivalent
to two basic baskets for urban and rural areas, which represent the national poverty line and basic needs in El Salvador
as of 2008.
c

In the case of monetary variables, observations over the 99th percentile were excluded.

Since price levels in urban and rural zones in El Salvador33
differ, in this column we test the hypothesis of equal means
by controlling for a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the household is located in a rural zone.

The term "national poor" refers to households whose members are below the national poverty
line in urban zones in Uruguay. This line is calculated monthly; in 2008, it ranged between USD
213 and USD 234 per capita per month. The poverty line represents a basic basket of "staple
food needs" plus a basic basket of "non-food needs", both calculated using 2006 as the base

The term "national poor" refers to households whose members were living on less than USD 167.67 per
capita per month in urban zones and less than USD 107.29 in rural zones between August and November 2010;
these figures are equivalent to two basic baskets, which represent the national poverty line and basic needs in
Mexico as of 2010.

In the case of monetary variables, observations over the 99th percentile were excluded.

Since price levels in urban and rural zones in Mexico differ, in this column we test the hypothesis of equal
