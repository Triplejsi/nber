Rational Housing Bubble

NBER Working Paper No. 19354
August 2013
JEL No. D21,E13,E21,R21
ABSTRACT
This paper studies an economy inhabited by overlapping generations of homeowners and investors,
with the only difference between the two being that homeowners derive utility from housing services
whereas investors do not. Tight collateral constraint limits the borrowing capacity of homeowners
and drives the equilibrium interest rate level down to the housing price growth rate, which makes housing
attractive as a store of value for investors. As long as the rental market friction is high enough, the
investors will hold a positive number of vacant houses in equilibrium. A housing bubble arises in an
equilibrium in which investors hold houses for resale purposes only and without the expectation of
receiving a dividend either in terms of utility or rent. The model can be applied to China, where the
housing bubble can be attributed to the rapid decline in the replacement rate of the pension system.

Housing assets play a dual role. These assets are not only an investment good
but also a consumption good. With the first property alone, housing assets, such
as fiat money, can have a positive value in the overlapping generation model developed by Samuelson (1958). People are willing to hold housing assets as a store
of value. Housing assets have a rational bubble because their intrinsic value is
zero. However, with the second property alone, housing assets, such as a Lucas
tree, cannot have a rational bubble in Samuelson’s model for the following reason: with a positive population growth rate, the model economy has two stationary
equilibria with an interest rate that is either above or below the population growth
rate.1 In equilibrium, the growth rate of the bubble is equal to the interest rate, and
the size of the bubble cannot grow more rapidly than the economy does. Therefore, only the lower interest rate is possible in equilibrium. Moreover, positive
dividends (either in terms of rent or in terms of utility) rule out a negative equilibrium interest rate. Hence, the growth rate of the bubble must be positive and
lower than the population growth rate, which implies that the size of the bubble as
a proportion of the economy approaches zero in the stationary equilibrium.
My research question is the following: can housing assets have a rational bubble with both properties described above? This paper departs from the two-period
consumption-loan model developed by Samuelson (1958) with only one twist: the
economy consists of two types of households, homeowners and investors, with the
only difference between the two being that homeowners derive utility from housing services whereas investors do not. With two types of households coexisting in
the model, the equilibrium can have two possible outcomes, which depend on the
degree of collateral constraint.
If the collateral constraint is loose, the model economy ultimately arrives at a
bubbleless equilibrium, in which investors lend to workers at an interest rate that
is higher than the population growth rate. Because the equilibrium interest rate
is higher than the return rate to housing assets (which is equal to the population
growth rate), investors have no incentives to hold the housing assets.
1 If the population growth rate is zero, there is only one equilibrium with a positive interest rate.

Tight collateral constraint limits the borrowing capacity of homeowners and
drives the equilibrium interest rate level down to the housing price growth rate,
which makes housing attractive as a store of value for investors. There is an
excess supply of funds from the investors and asset shortage because homeowners
are borrowing-constrained at the equilibrium interest rate. In the equilibrium,
investors use the excess funds to purchase houses that are useless to them and
expect that the future young investors will purchase the housing assets from them.
As long as the rental housing market friction is high enough, the rental market
cannot absorb all of the housing assets bought by investors and the investors will
hold some empty houses in the equilibrium. This behavior occurs because high
rental market friction implies a higher rental-price-to-housing-price ratio, which
has homeowners substitute rental housing for owner-occupied housing. However,
investors are always indifferent between leaving houses empty or renting them out
in a bubbly equilibrium. This suggests that the elasticity of rental houses supply is
infinitely elastic and the amount of housing that are rented out in the equilibrium
is completely determined by the demand of homeowners. Therefore, a housing
bubble arises in an equilibrium in which investors hold houses for resale purposes
only and not with the expectation of receiving a dividend either in terms of utility
or rent.
The main contribution of the paper is the extension of Samuelson (1958) to include two types of agents with preference heterogeneity and to show that a housing bubble is possible even if only part of the population derives dividends from
housing assets. The presence of a bubble is robust to the production sector and to
the rental housing market. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of bubbly equilibrium are tight collateral constraint and high rental market
friction.
The second contribution of the paper is the demonstration that a housing bubble can still exist in a production economy à la Diamond (1965). Tirole (1985)
uses that framework to study the existence of a bubble in the presence of a Lucas tree that pays a fixed dividend. Tirole shows that a bubble absorbs the excess

2

savings and helps achieve efficiency as long as the economy would become dynamically inefficient if there was no bubble. This paper extends Tirole (1985)
to the study of housing assets, the rent value of which is endogenous and grows
as rapidly as the economy does. In a similar vein, my paper shows that a housing bubble absorbs the excess savings from investors and removes dynamic efficiency although the sources of dynamic inefficiency are different. The dual role of
housing assets remove the multiplicity of equilibria and the stationary equilibrium
achieved is unique.
There is extensive literature on asset bubbles. My paper is related to rational bubbles under symmetric information. (See Brunnermeier (2009) for other
forms of bubbles). In terms of causes of a bubble, recent studies on bubbles focus on financial friction and credit constraint. Kocherlakota (2009), Miao and
Wang (2011), Farhi and Tirole (2012), and Martin and Ventura (2012) introduce
credit constraint and investor heterogeneity. Bubbles serve as a collateral asset that
helps alleviate the financial constraint of productive firms. Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2006) and Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2008) argue that speculative
bubbles alleviate the asset scarcity problem in an emerging market and explain
global imbalance. Instead of focusing on the role of bubbles in alleviating the
borrowing constraint of investment, this paper focuses on the roles of bubbles as
a store of value for household consumption. In other words, previous studies hold
that households purchase bubble assets to borrow (and invest). In my paper, it is
argued that households purchase bubble assets to save(and consume).
The theoretical model of Arce and Lopez-Salido (2011) is the most similar
to that presented in my paper. Arce and Lopez-Salido (2011) introduces housing assets in a three-period OLG model, in which multiple stationary equilibria
exist depending on the financial constraint. My paper constructs a two-period
overlapping-generation model with two types of agents and a production sector. It
shows that multiple equilibria do not necessarily appear in the overlapping generation model. In some sense, the bubble that arises may show strong stability. Arce
and Lopez-Salido (2011) does not consider the production sector and therefore is

3

silent about investment and capital accumulation.
In terms of model predictions, the investment-related demand for a store of
value can generate positive co-movement between investment and asset prices.
The consumption-related demand for a store of value usually crowds out savings
and reduces investment. However, my model is able to generate the right correlation based on exogenous shocks to the liquidity supply. In the empirical section, I
apply the model to China, where the housing bubble can be attributed to the rapid
decline in the replacement rate of the pension system.
In terms of welfare implications, all previous studies hold that bubble is Pareto
improving and efficient if it does not burst. In my paper, it is argued that a bubble is
good for investors because it is a good substitute for consumption loans. However,
bubble reduces the welfare of homeowners. Moreover, it raises the borrowing rate
and reduces the amount of housing services consumed.
The structure of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1 constructs an
overlapping generation model with exogenous endowment growth to illustrate the
existence of housing bubble. Section 2 discusses the model extension which includes the rental housing market and production sector. Section 3 considers a
policy experiment of pension reform that may cause the merge of housing bubble. It uses empirical evidence from China to test the implications of theoretical
model. Concluding remarks are provided in Section 5.

1 Benchmark Model
The benchmark model is a two-period overlapping generation model based on the
consumption-loan model by Samuelson (1958).

4

1.1 Preference and Endowment
The economy is inhabited by two types of households: investors and homeowners.
Both types live for two periods. Investors have the Cobb-Douglas utility function

t
t
u I ctt , ct+1
= ln ctt + β ln ct+1

(1)

t
where β > 0. Let ctt and ct+1
denote the non-durable consumption of households
born at t at time t and t + 1, respectively. The homeowners derive utility not only

from non-durable consumption but also from housing services.

t
t
u H ctt , ct+1
, h tt+1 = ln ctt + β (1 − ζ ) ln ct+1
+ βζ ln h tt+1

(2)

where 0 < ζ < 1. Because of the homothetic preference, both types of households
spend 1/ (1 + β) of their total wealth in the first-period consumption in absence
of borrowing constraint.
Both investors and homeowners receive ytt when young and 0 when old.2 Denote the growth rate of output per capita by g. Hence,

In each period, there are Nt ω young homeowners and Nt (1 − ω) young investors,
0 < ω < 1. The population growth rate is

2 includes the production sector and endogenous wage rate. Since I introduce payas-you-go social security in the model, the old will receive positive pension benefit. Hence, I can
normalize the labor income of the elderly to zero without loss of generality.

5

1.2 Social Security
The government is running a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) social security plan. It collects τ ytt from each young individual at period t and pays τ (1 + n) ytt to each old
generation, where τ ≥ 0. Hence, the gross return on PAYG system is given by
(1 + g) (1 + n). There is no government consumption. The government budget
constraint is balanced each period.

1.3 Asset Market
The price of owner-occupied houses in terms of non-durable consumption goods
is given by pt . Housing assets are completely divisible. For simplicity, I assume
away rental market in the benchmark model. It can be considered as the extreme
case where rental market friction is too high. See the extension of the model in
section 2 for the active rental market.
Both homeowners and investors are subject to the same borrowing constraint
t
≥ − (1 − θ ) pt h tt+1
at+1

(5)

where housing is the only collateral in this economy. The downpayment ratio θ
satisfies 0 < θ < 1.
The model abstracts from housing construction. It assumes the total stock of
housing in the economy is Ht , which is a continuous and differentiable function
of pt . Incoporating the housing construction by government or investors will not
affect the qualitative conclusion of the paper.

In order to characterize the existence and uniqueness of the stationary equilibrium, we first study the properties of optimal decision rules. Lemma 4 describes
the shapes of the supply curve and demand curve in the loan market.
Lemma 4 The loan demand (loan supply) of homeowners (investors) is always a
strictly decreasing (increasing) function of interest rate.

The following lemma 5 actually states that the dynamic inefficiency, i.e., R ∗ <
n + g, can not happen in the equilibrium. The intuition is the following. As
long as there are positive measure of homeowners, the model economy is similar
to the Samuelson model with a Lucas tree, which rules out negative net interest
rate. However, it can not rule out zero net interest rate because of the collateral
constraint and the presence of investors.
Lemma 5 If 0 < ω, θ < 1, there is no stationary equilibrium with gross interest
rate R ∗ < 1
Proof. See Appendix.
The proposition 6 characterizes the uniqueness of stationary equilibrium. Intuitively, tighter borrowing constraint (higher θ ) reduces the loan demand from
homeowners and drives the equilibrium interest rate down. Homeowners are more
likely to be borrowing constrained under low interest rate.
Proposition 6 There exists a unique stationary equilibrium.
1. If θ ≤ θ L , there are unconstrained homeowners and unconstrained investors holding zero housing assets
2. If θ L < θ ≤ θ H , there are borrowing-constrained homeowners and unconstrained investors holding zero housing assets
3. If θ > θ H , then there are constrained homeowners and unconstrained investors holding housing assets

Proof. See Appendix.
Figure 1 shows the stationary equilibrium in three cases. The dotted line is the
loan supply of investors. The minimum equilibrium gross interest rate is 1. The
solid line is the loan demand from homeowners. As proved by Lemma 1, it is a
decreasing function of interest rate. It is kinked because it consists of two parts.
The flatter part is the loan demand of unconstrained homeowners. The steeper
part is the loan demand of borrowing-constrained homeowners. The intersection
point pins down the equilibrium interest rate.
Proposition 7 The third case of stationary equilibrium, i.e., constrained homeowners and unconstrained investors with empty housing, is a bubbly equilibrium
for investors, but not for homeowners.
Proof. See Appendix.
The proposition 7 describes the special feature of the equilibrium with bubble, i.e., it is a bubble from investor’s point of view only. It may seem strange.
However, in order to understand the intuition, let me quote a paragraph from Tirole (1985). He described two views of money: the fundamentalist view and the
bubbly view of money. The fundamentalist view argues that “money is held to
finance transactions (or to pay taxes or to satisfy a reserve requirement). To this
purpose, money must be a store of value. However, it is not held for speculative
purposes as there is no bubble on money.” The bubbly view argues that“money is a
pure store value à la Samuelson (1958). It does not serve any transaction purpose
at least in the long run. This view implies that price of money (bubble) grows at
the real rate of interest, and that money is held entirely for speculation”.“The two
representations are in the long run inconsistent.”
This paper combines the two views together in one model through different
preferences on housing assets. Homeowners derive utility from housing assets.
This is similar to the fundamentalist view. Investors treat housing assets as investment tools and a store of value. This is same as the bubbly view. Therefore, it
shows that the two representations can be consistent when we study two types of
agents and a special type of asset: housing assets.

2 Model Extension
This section extends the benchmark model to include the rental market and production sector. It shows that the qualitative results in the previous section still
hold.

2.1 Model with Rental Market

problem can be written as

R denotes the amount of houses that are rent out. δ > 0 denotes the

depreciation rate of rental housing. I assume frictional rental market in this paper,

in the sense that owner-occupied housing will have a smaller depreciation rate than
rental housing. This can be interpreted as the moral hazard problem of tenants. I
normalize the depreciation rate of owner-occupied housing to zero.
Because of the assumption that investors can not derive utility flow directly
from rental housing, the investors will not rent houses in the model. Since all the
homeowners are homogenous, they will not provide positive rental housing in the
equilibrium. Hence, the homeowners are the demand side of rental market. The

The policy functions for the problem of investors (8) and homeowners (9) are
solved in the Appendix. The following lemma 9 can simplify the our analysis a
lot.
Lemma 9 Unconstrained homeowners will not rent houses in the stationary equilibrium.
Proof. See Appendix.
We are interested in wether the rental market can remove the bubbly stationary
equilibrium. To simplify the analysis, I assume away pension system, i.e., let
τ = 0. The the following proposition 10 states that a housing bubble exists in the
equilibrium after the pension reform if the collateral constraint θ and the rental
market friction δr are large enough.
Proposition 10 If the collateral constraint θ > ω and the rental market friction
δr is large enough, there exists a bubble equilibrium after the pension reform.
More precisely,
1. If δr ≥ θ ζ , then homeowners will not rent houses and investors will hold
empty houses. There exists a housing bubble for investors.
2. If θ ζ > δr ≥ ωζ , then homeowners will rent some houses and investors will
still hold some empty houses. There exists a housing bubble for investors.

2.2 Model with Production Sector
The benchmark model can be extended to include the production sector à la Diamond (1965). Suppose there exists a production sector with production function
written as
Yt = F (K t , At L t )

(10)

where the growth rate of labor-augmented technology is given by At+1 / At =
1 + g. Suppose F (K t , At L t ) = K tα (At L t )1−α , the profit maximization of the
firm implies that
Rt = 1 + α K tα−1 (At L t )1−α − δ
wt = (1 − α) At K tα ( At L t )−α
Now the investors’ problem becomes
t
max ln ctt + β ln ct+1

(11)

subject to the following constraints

ctt + at+1

We are interested in the stationary equilibrium with production sector. To simplify the analysis, I assume away the pension system, i.e., let τ = 0. The proposition 12 proves that a housing bubble can exist even under a production sector. It is
essentially a dynamic inefficiency condition for the economy with housing assets.
Housing bubble solves the dynamic inefficiency problem by absorbing the excess
supply of loan in the market.
Proposition 12 If τ = 0 and the following condition holds, then there exists a
housing bubble in the stationary equilibrium.

3 Policy Experiment and Data
3.1 Pension Reform
We now consider a policy experiment. Suppose the government removes the
PAYG system, i.e., τ = 0. The removal of PAYG will always increase the supply
of loan in the economy. It will reduce the borrowing of unconstrained homeowners. However, for the constrained homeowners, it will increase their loan demand.
This is because the borrowing limit is increased by purchasing more housing assets using extra money from tax reduction.
Figure 2 is an illustration of pension reform in the endowment economy. The
dotted line denotes the demand and supply of loans before the pension reform. The
solid line denotes the loan demand and supply after the pension reform. Whether
the new equilibrium interest rate will be pushed down towards zero depends on
the tightness of collateral constraint. If the borrowing constraint is tight enough,
the increase in the loan supply will surpass the increasing loan demand from constrained homeowners. Therefore, a housing bubble is possible. The proposition

13 gives a sufficient condition for the housing bubble to exist in the endowment
economy.
Proposition 13 In the endowment economy, suppose the government removes the
PAYG system. Bubble will arise if and only if θ > ω. A sufficient condition for
housing wealth/GDP ratio to be higher than the pre-reform era is τ > θ−ω
1−ω .
Proof. See Appendix.
Figure 3 exhibits the policy experiments in all three cases, i.e., θ < θ L , θ L <
θ < θ H , and θ > θ H . According to proposition 13, only pension reform in case
2 and case 3 (described in proposition 6) can trigger housing bubble.
Proposition 12 already states a sufficient condition for the housing bubble to
exist in a production economy after the removal of pension system. The proposition 14 describes the transitional dynamics after the pension reform.
Proposition 14 In the production economy, suppose the government removes the
PAYG system and there exists a housing bubble in the new stationary equilibrium.
Both housing price and interest rate converge monotonically to the unique new
steady state.
Proof. See Appendix.
Figure 4 shows the transition path after the pension reform in a production
economy. The normalized interest rate is defined as the gross interest rate divided
by the gross population growth rate plus the productivity growth rate. The normalized housing price growth rate is the housing price sequence divided by the
current population and productivity level. The investment is normalized in the
similar way. The normalized wage rate is defined as the wage rate divided by the
current productivity. The proof of the proposition shows that the housing price
growth rate is equal to the gross interest rate during the transition. Therefore,
investors will hold housing assets right after the pension reform.

3.2 Data
In this section, I use China’s experience as a test for the theoretical model. Although the US has already experienced a burst in housing bubble in 2008, housing
prices in China have been increasing strongly over the past decade. The connected
solid line in Figure 5 shows that the real land-selling price for the whole country
increases at an annual rate 15.7 percent from 2000 to 2009. Unfortunately, there is
no constant-quality official housing price index for China. I also draw the official
average commodity building selling price for 35 large cities in China. It exhibits
a slower annual growth rate, 7 percent, from year 2000 to 2009. Wu, Gyourko
and Deng (2012) constructs constant quality price index for newly-built private
housing in 35 major Chinese cities. According to their estimates, the annual price
growth is nearly 10 percent from year 2000 to 2009.
The unprecedented housing boom in China encourages large increase real estate investment and the boom in the home ownerships. As shown by Figure 6, the
share of real estate investment in total fixed investment increases from 13 percent
at 1999 to 20 percent at 2010. The urban households home ownerships rate estimated from Urban Households Survey shows that China’s home ownership rate
is nearly 90 percent in 2010, among the highest in the world.3 These two facts
imply that a lot of households own more than one apartment.
Popular wisdoms claim that there is a housing bubble in China. According
to the theoretical model, one evidence for the housing bubble is the high vacancy
3 The

urban home ownership rate increases from less than 30 percent to 70 percent during
1994-1999, a period when the housing reform takes place. Before the housing reform, it is the
state-owned enterprises (SOE) that are responsible for providing employee housing to workers,
with a little or no charge for rents. The government liberalizes the housing market in 1994 by
selling the public housing to the current employee in state-owned enterprises at heavily subsidized
price. Newly employed workers in SOE and workers in the private sectors have to purchase houses
that are provided by private real estate developers. The transition into the new housing system ends
around 1999, after which no SOE are allowed to provide employee housing to their workers. At
the end of year 2010, the home ownership rate of urban households in China is 89.3 percent, which
is among the highest in the world. 40.1 percent of them own privatized houses which previously
are owned by the government or state-owned enterprises. 38 percent of households have bought
houses that are provided at a market price.

rate in China’s housing market. A vacant house/apartment is a unit that has been
sold but is not occupied by anybody. The vacancy rate is defined as all vacant
units/all housing units (occupied + vacant). In the US, the gross vacancy rate rises
from 12.7 to 14.5 during 2005-2010. In China, according to the China Family
Panel Studies 2011, 22 percent of urban households own more than one apartment.
Among them, only 25 percent households rent their apartments out. The vacancy
rate in year 2010 is 11 percent according to author’s estimate.
One of the reason that households hold empty apartment is lack of investment instruments and the need for a store of value. The conflict between the two
is strengthened by the insufficient social security, which forces the middle-aged
to buy empty houses as a store of value to finance their later-life consumption.
Figure 7 plots the pension replacement rate and contribution rate in China. The
pension reform starts in China from 1999, which shifts the traditional pay-as-yougo (PAYG) system to a mixture of PAYG system and fully-funded system. From
then on, the replacement rate of pension system decreases from around 75 percent
to only 45 percent in 2009. During the same period, the saving rate in China increases by 15 percent, which suggests that Chinese households increase savings
partly to compensate the huge decline in the pension payment.
What if those households just invest their pension in terms of stocks and other
investment tools? Because the poor development in the financial market, the average return on the stock market over the past twenty years in very low (the average
real return on shanghai stock market index is only 2 percent from year 2000 to
2009) and median households can only access to risk-free bond which delivers almost zero interest actually. Therefore, the missing social security is accompanied
by the dynamic inefficiency in China. Figure 8 shows that the real interest rate is
China is much lower than the real GNP growth rate, which makes risk-free bond
unattractive relative to housing assets.
Although there is studies documenting that the capital return in China is very
high, however, those projects are not accessible to normal households in China.
In fact, Chinese government itself has accumulated great amount of foreign as-

sets and implicitly issue collateralized bonds to Chinese citizens. The low return
of government bonds reflects the huge demand for assets or investment tools in
China. There are many reasons for causing the dynamic inefficiency problem,
e.g., the poor financial development, the absence of social security system, etc. If
the capital account were fully open, Chinese households would have purchased
huge amount of assets abroad directly. This dynamic inefficiency creates excess
supply of liquidity which allows for speculative bubble.

3.3 Test of the Model
The pension system in China mainly operates at city or province levels. Each city
or province has its own pension fund account and replacement rate. Therefore,
we can exploit the regional variations in pension system to identify its effect on
regional housing prices. According to the model prediction, we would observe
larger housing price appreciation for the province where the pension contribution
rate declines most. I first compute the theoretical contribute rate τ i,t , which is the
tax rate that would balance the budget constraint of pay-as-you-go pension system
for province i at year t.
τ i,t =

expenditurei,t
workeri,t × wagei,t

, i = 1, . . . , 35, t = 2001, . . . , 2011

where expenditurei,t the total expenditure of pension fund at province i and year
t. workeri,t is the number of workers covered by the pension fund and wagei,t is
the average wage rate of workers.
Figure 9 plots the changes in housing prices across 35 cities against the changes
in the theoretical contribution rates over year 2001-2011. There is a clear negative
correlation, which confirms the prediction of the theory. The simple OLS univariate regression has a coefficient -2.84, which is significant at 1 percent confidence
level. The R squared is .24.
In order to estimate the effect of theoretical contribution rate on housing price,
I run the following regression.

The commodity building sell prices is based on the 35-city average selling price
series from National Bureau of Statistics. All series are in log real value deflated
by CPI (Urban CPI for Chinese data). Most 35 cities are the capital cities. Since
the pension system is mainly operating at provincial level, I merge the capital
city with their province and compute theoretical contribution rate using provincial
data. The size of dot represents the size of the population in that province.

where Z i,t include the city dummies, year dummies and the log gd pi,t for province

theoretical contribution rate minus the actual contribution rate. This measures
the other channel which pension reform can affect the households behavior and
housing prices.
The regression results are given by Table 1. The coefficient before the theoretical contribution rate is smaller than the slope in Figure 9. The fixed effect

model shows that a 10 percentage points decline in the theoretical contribution
rate contributes to a 14.2 percent increase in real housing price level.

4 Conclusion
This paper studies an economy inhabited by overlapping generations of homeowners and investors, with the only difference between the two being that homeowners

32

derive utility from housing services whereas investors do not. Tight collateral constraint limits the borrowing capacity of homeowners and drives the equilibrium
interest rate level down to the housing price growth rate, which makes housing
attractive as a store of value for investors. As long as the rental market friction is
high enough, the investors will hold a positive number of vacant houses in equilibrium. A housing bubble arises in an equilibrium in which investors hold houses
for resale purposes only and without the expectation of receiving a dividend either
in terms of utility or rent. The model can be applied to China, where the housing
bubble can be attributed to the rapid decline in the replacement rate of the pension
system.
This paper also shed some lights on the issue of government debt. If the government lends too much when the collateral constraint is high, it will drive the
interest too low and investors will start to accumulate bubble assets. The Chinese government passed a stimulus package after the financial crisis hits the US
in 2008, which triggered a further wave of housing price boom in China.

A.3 Proof of Lemma 4
We start first by looking the saving function of the unconstrained homeowner/investor.
It is obvious to see the saving function of the unconstrained homeowner/investor is
a decreasing function of interest rate. When the investor is borrowing constrained,
higher interest rate reduces γ t and implies fewer housing bought. Hence, the
amount investor can borrowing is a decreasing function of interest rate. When the
homeowner is borrowing constrained, the loan demand function becomes complicated. Differentiate pt h tt+1 directly w.r.t. ϕ

Therefore, ∂ϕt+1 > 0, ∂ Rt+1 < 0 The loan demand of constrained homeowner

A.4 Proof of Lemma 5
The stationary equilibrium is defined as the competitive general equilibrium in
which all individual allocations and prices are time invariant. We need to further assume that Ht = H̄ in the stationary equilibrium to get constant housing
price. Denote the constant housing price by p ∗ . Obviously we have p ∗ > 0.
Otherwise, workers would purchase infinite amount of houses. Suppose the equilibrium gross interest R ∗ < 1. The gross return of housing for the investors is 1,
which is higher than the gross return R ∗ on consumption loans. From the previous decision rules, the borrowing constraint for both types of households would
be binding. The total borrowing of workers is positive and the total borrowing of
investors is non-negative. Therefore, the market for loans can not clear at R ∗ < 1.
Equilibrium interest rate has to be higher and R ∗ < 1 cannot be a equilibrium
interest rate. Note that if θ = 1, both investors and households can not borrow in
the equilibrium. Any R ∗ < 1 can be the equilibrium interest rate.

A.5 Proof of Proposition 6
The optimal demand and supply of loans are continuous. Lemma ?? proves that
the demand of loans from homeowners is monotonically decreasing in the interest
rate and the supply of loans from investors is a monotonically increasing function
of interest rate. From Lemma 5, there exists a unique stationary equilibrium with
R ∗ ≥ 1.
Investors will not be borrowing constrained when R ∗ ≥ 1. They supply loans
in the market. θ will only affect the optimal decision of homeowners, who are the
demand side of loan market. High θ reduces the borrowing limit of constrained
homeowners. If θ is high enough, the total borrowing from homeowners become
less than the total loan supply from investors. Net interest has to be lower in order
to clear the consumption loan market. When the net interest rate drops to zero,
investors would then invest extra cash in the housing market. Therefore, there
are two threshold levels for collateral constraint, denoted by θ L and θ H and three

44

different cases which we analyze one by one.

reduce the consumption and housing expenditure. They will be borrowing
constrained under a stricter borrowing constraint.

On one hand, tighter credit constraint reduces the housing demand, which
tends to reduce the price. However, tighter credit constraint also reduces
interest rate, which in turns encourages housing consumption. Hence, the
total effect is indeterminate.

It is also true that ∂θ∂ωH > 0. This is because high ω implies fewer loan supply
from investors. The collateral constraint has to be higher to clear the loan
market.

A.6 Proof of Proposition 7
Suppose there is a useless asset called paper. In case 3, it has positive value in
the equilibrium. This is because investor has excess supply of loan in the market,
which can be invested in the paper. Since the equilibrium interest rate is 1, the
price of paper remains constant in the equilibrium. The size of the paper bubble
is given by

This is called pure bubble. However, the bubble can also take the form of housing
assets. If the investors purchase the housing assets I instead, then
B = (1 − ω) I
which means bubble can shift from paper market to the housing market. If we define the bubble as the case in which investors hold houses for resale purposes only
and not with the expectation of receiving a dividend either in terms of utility or
rent, then the case 3 satisfies this definition because we rule out the rental market.
The next question is whether there is bubble for homeowners? The answer is no.
First of all, we define the fundamental value of housing assets to homeowners,
and then we show that under properly adjusted interest rate, the housing price is
equal to its fundamental value for homeowners in all three cases.

This suggests that investors would not hold housing assets because the return of
investment in housing assets is strictly less than the return on consumption loans.
Hence, h rt+1 = 0 if homeowners are borrowing constrained. This is a contradiction. Therefore, h rt+1 = 0 if homeowners are unconstrained.

A.9 Proof of Proposition 10
Since our point of interest is to see whether frictional rental market can resolve the
problem of vacant houses and prevent the rise of bubbles, I assume θ > θ L = ω,
such that there exists a bubble after the pension reform when δr = 0. From Lemma
10, we know that investors will hold housing assets only if homeowners are borrowing constrained. Therefore, I only consider the equilibrium where homeowners are borrowing constrained and investors lend to homeowners.
When there is a housing bubble, R ∗ = 1. For the investors to be indifferent
between holding empty houses and renting them out, it must be pr = δr p. For
the homeowners to rent positive amount of housing, the necessary condition is
R∗ <

If δr ≥ θ ζ , then pr h r < 0. Homeowners demand zero rental housing if the rental
