Semiparametric Estimates of Monetary Policy Effects: String Theory Revisited

NBER Working Paper No. 19355

JEL No. C32,C54,E52,E58,E65
ABSTRACT
We develop a flexible semiparametric time series estimator that is then used to assess the causal effect
of monetary policy interventions on macroeconomic aggregates. Our estimator captures the average
causal response to discrete policy interventions in a macro-dynamic setting, without the need for assumptions
about the process generating macroeconomic outcomes. The proposed procedure, based on propensity
score weighting, easily accommodates asymmetric and nonlinear responses. Application of this estimator
to the effects of monetary restraint suggest contractionary policy slows real economic activity. By
contrast, the Federal Reserve's ability to stimulate real economic activity through monetary expansion
appears to be much more limited. Estimates for recent financial crisis years are similar to those for
the earlier, pre-crisis period.

Introduction

The string metaphor is an enduring feature of the debate over monetary policy: increasing borrowing
costs may reliably slow an expansion, but cheap capital need not stimulate investment in a downturn.
What does the historical record say regarding the possibly di¤erent macroeconomic e¤ects of monetary
contraction and expansion? As many have recognized, this question is easy to ask but hard to answer.
The identi…cation challenge in this context arises from the fact that policy changes are rarely isolated
from other economically important developments, including, perhaps, anticipated changes in economic
conditions. If these changes are related to the outcome variables of interest, one subset of time series
observations likely provides a poor control for another.
Many contemporary investigations of macro policy rely on structural models of economic behavior
to solve this fundamental identi…cation problem (see, for example, the survey by Christiano, Trabandt
and Walentin, 2011). This approach, typically cast in a dynamic structural general equilibrium (DSGE)
framework, begins with a model of the macroeconomy that is meant to mimic the time series behavior
of key macro variables. In addition to theoretical predictions, DSGE models generate a system of linear
(or linearized) di¤erence equations that provide the basis for empirical work.

These equations can

be interpreted as vector autoregressions (VARs) with an associated set of coe¢ cient or error-covariance
restrictions (as in Bagliano and Favero, 1998; Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 1999; and many others).
The heart of the DSGE approach uses a model of the entire economy to isolate shocks that identify causal
policy e¤ects. The validity of the resulting causal inferences therefore turns in part on how accurately
economic models describe the macroeconomy.
2

An alternative strategy, inspired by the landmark Friedman and Schwartz (1963) volume, tries to
identify policy shocks through a close reading of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC)
meeting minutes. Romer and Romer (1989) is the …rst in a series of in‡uential contemporary studies in
this mold. A drawback of the narrative approach is the subjective manner in which shocks are identi…ed.
Moreover, some of the putatively random policy shifts identi…ed in Romer and Romer (1989) may be
correlated with economic variables (an argument ‡eshed out in Hoover and Pérez, 1994; see Romer and
Romer, 1994 for a rebuttal).
This paper outlines a new route to causal inference for monetary policy e¤ects, sidestepping some
of the di¢ culties encountered in structural and narrative-based e¤orts.
approach is a laser-like focus on the policy-making process.

The de…ning feature of our

In contrast with the narrative approach,

which also focuses on Fed decision-making, our analysis of Fed behavior is more formal and data-driven.
Our solution to the policy evaluation problem starts with the presumption that, conditional on marketderived statistics that embed optimal forecasts of future outcomes and anticipated policy moves, along
with a small set of institutional and economic variables, policy variation can be used to identify causal
e¤ects. This assumption allows us to quantify the causal e¤ect of policy changes in an environment of
stable expectations and goals. At the same time, our empirical strategy easily accommodates nonlinear
e¤ects, while distinguishing the e¤ects of monetary easing from those of tightening.
The selection-on-observables framework outlined here is founded on strong identifying assumptions,
but also provides a natural starting point for time series causal inference. In the absence of purposefully
designed experiments or naturally occurring quasi-experimental shifts, it’s hard to see how one can do
better than to use the policy variation at hand. Our focused approach limits the task of model speci…cation
and robustness checking to the formulation and testing of a model of the policy determination process.
The selection-on-observables assumption also buys us strong testable restrictions that can be used to assess
the plausibility of causal claims. The principal econometric question that arises in our context is how to
exploit selection-on-observables identi…cation in a manner that imposes minimal auxiliary assumptions
and facilitates speci…cation testing.
Our econometric policy model describes the probability of federal funds rate target changes conditional
on market statistics, past policy choices, lagged outcomes, and a few other controls. The resulting set
of conditional distributions de…nes a function we call the policy propensity score. Monetary policy rules
have long been studied in macroeconomics; see, for example, Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000), Woodford
(2001) and Galí and Gertler (2007) for recent contributions. Propensity score methods, introduced by
Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), have proven useful for cross-sectional causal inference (see, e.g., Dehejia
and Wahba (1999) and Heckman, Ichimura and Todd(1998)).

In a pair of papers closely related to

this one, Angrist and Kuersteiner (2004, 2011), adapt the propensity score framework to the problem of
time series causality testing of the sort discussed by Granger (1969) and Sims (1972). We extend this
framework here, deriving ‡exible, easy-to-compute propensity score estimators of the causal e¤ects of a
dynamic multinomial treatment. These semiparametric estimators are then used to assess the impact of
3

monetary policy before and since the Great Recession. The main payo¤ to our approach is the ability to
go directly from the policy process to causal e¤ects on outcomes. The resulting causal estimates are valid
for all processes generating outcomes, nonlinear and complex as they might be, while allowing distinct
assessments of the impact of tight and easy money.
The …rst task on our empirical agenda is the construction of a credible model for the policy propensity
score. To that end, we follow Kuttner (2001), Faust, Swanson and Wright (2004), and Piazzesi and
Swanson (2008) in using market-based measures of anticipated policy. Speci…cally, we rely on Piazzesi’s
(2005) model linking Federal Reserve policy actions with asset prices. This link is used to justify a model
for target rate changes as a function of the price of federal funds rate futures contracts. Market-based
predictions of policy actions provide a low-dimension aggregator of publicly available information. This
in turn leads to parsimonious policy models well suited to a data-poor time series setting.
Our investigation of monetary policy e¤ects replicates …ndings from earlier work while uncovering some
that are new. Echoing the …ndings of Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996, 1999)), among others,
our results suggest contractionary monetary policy slows real economic activity, reducing employment
as well as in‡ation. At the same time, in contrast with a number of earlier studies (such as those
reviewed in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 1999), the semiparametric estimation strategy developed
here suggests Fed e¤orts to support the real economy have been disappointing. The ease with which this
asymmetric response is revealed is an attractive feature of our approach. Finally, motivated by interest in
the Fed’s attempts to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession, we compare responses calculated
using a sample that ends in mid-2005 with results from a sample running through 2008, when the federal
funds target rate hit zero.

We also compute estimates for the latter period only.

Our conclusions

regarding the Fed’s limited ability to boost real economic activity stand under both variations.

Potential Outcomes and Macro Causal E¤ects

2.1

Conceptual Framework

The economy is described by the vector,

t

= (x0t ; yt0 ; Dt0 )0 ; where yt is a ky -vector of outcome variables,

Dt is a vector of policy variables that takes on values d0 ; :::; dJ , and xt is a vector of contemporaneous
covariates.
Policy is determined by lagged economic conditions, lagged policy choices, and covariates; combined
in the vector zt = f [xt ;
parameter space

t 1 ]:

The policy regime is indexed by a parameter,

, which takes values in a

: In addition, policymakers are assumed to react to idiosyncratic information or taste

variables, represented by the scalar "t , that we don’t get to see. The realized policy Dt is determined
by both observed and unobserved variables according to Dt = D(zt ; ; "t ). For identi…cation purposes,
we assume that "t is independent of potential outcomes. This is reminiscent of the recursive ordering
proposed by Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996, 1999), but our approach requires no description

4

of the structural process connecting yt with policy choices or expected future values of

t:

Our framework for causal inference builds on the notion of potential outcomes. Potential outcomes
describe realizations of yt that arise in response to a hypothetical change in monetary policy.

The

potential outcomes concept originated in experimental studies where the investigator has control over the
assignment of treatments, but is now widely used in observational studies. Although potential outcomes
most commonly appear in studies looking at the causal e¤ects of a binary treatment or policy intervention,
the idea is easily extended to ordered discrete or continuous interventions (see, e.g., Angrist and Imbens,
1995).
The de…nition of potential outcomes used here comes from Angrist and Kuersteiner (2011):
De…nition 1 For …xed t,l, and

, potential outcomes fyt;l (d) ; d 2 Dg are de…ned as the set of values

the observed outcome variable yt+l would take on if Dt = D(zt ; ; "t ) = d, for all possible policy choices
d, d 2 fd0 ; :::; dj ; :::; dJ g.
The vector of potential outcomes includes the observed outcome, yt+l = yt;l (Dt ), as well as counterfactual
outcomes describing the consequences of policy choices not taken. The causal e¤ect of a policy change is
de…ned as the di¤erence yt;l (dj ) yt;l (d0 ), where dj indicates an intervention and d0 indicates a benchmark
policy. This notation makes a conceptual distinction between changes to the policy regime (indicated by
changes in

) and policy changes within the same regime, though only the latter are identi…ed in our

framework.

Although the notation introduced here is nonstandard in a macro setting, the notion of

macroeconomic causal e¤ects determined by counterfactual states has a long history. Cochrane (1994),
for example, quotes Kareken and Solow (1963):"... One cannot deduce conclusions about the e¤ects of
monetary policy or about their timing without making some hypothesis, explicit or implicit, about what
the course of events would have been had the monetary authorities acted di¤erently." (emphasis added)
In a macroeconomic context, potential outcomes can be generated by a DSGE structure. Suppose,
as in Cochrane (1994), that output is determined by
yt = ay" "t + ayD Dt + ay
where the a are parameters and

t

t;

is an i.i.d. shock (The mapping between a and

(1)
may be obtained

by linearizing a non-linear DSGE model.). Cochrane’s monetary policy rule is given by
Dt = aDy yt

1

+ "t

(2)

The resulting moving average representation for yt can be written
yt =

Here, cy";j is the impulse response function for output in response to policy shocks. Suppose, that instead
of the realized policy, Dt is set to dj . The potential outcome induced by this manipulation is:

This tell us what we can expect to see in response to such a change, in a world where the path of
shocks is otherwise unchanged. The associated causal e¤ect of this policy change is yt;l (dj )
cy";j (dj

yt;l (d0 ) =

d0 ). Thus, causal e¤ects in our framework match those determined by a VAR in a linear,

constant-e¤ects world.
Individual causal e¤ects can never be observed since the real world gives us on only one realization. We

describes an average generalized impulse response function for all possible policy choices. In contrast
with traditional impulse response analyses in empirical macro, however, the impulse response function
estimated here can be both asymmetric and nonlinear.
Potential outcomes for counterfactual policy choices are unobserved, so the expectation in (5) cannot
be estimated directly. The variation that identi…es causal relationships in our framework is characterized
by a conditional independence assumption, also known as selection on observables:
Condition 1 Selection on observables:

cy" , through the parameter aDy : Cochrane (1994) shows that cy" may change as fed behavior changes.
Our conditional independence assumption focuses on variation in policy interventions while holding the
policy regime …xed, after conditioning on observables, zt . Leeper and Zha’s (2003) notion of modest
policy interventions captures the same idea. In the simple model described by (1) and (2), selection on
6

observables requires serially independent "t , independent of

t.

Using Equation (4) and Condition 1, we can write the average policy e¤ect conditional on zt in terms
of observable distributions as:
h
E Yt;L (dj )

i
Yt;L (d0 )jzt = E [Yt;L jDt = dj ; zt ]

E [Yt;L jDt = d0 ; zt ] :

(6)

Although cast in terms of in-principle observable conditional means, in applications with a high-dimensional
conditioning set involving continuous random variables, estimation of these conditional expectations is
empirically demanding. The estimation problem is simpli…ed by use of a parametric model for the policy
function. Angrist and Kuersteiner (2011) call this model the policy propensity score.
The policy propensity score is P (Dt = dj jzt ) = pj (zt ; ) ; where pj (zt ; ) is a ‡exible parametric

model with parameters determined by the policy regime. Average causal e¤ects can then be estimated
using the fact that Condition 1 implies

This weighting scheme was …rst used to estimate population means in non-random samples by Horvitz
and Thompson (1952) and adapted for the estimation of causal e¤ects of cross-sectional Bernoulli treatments by Hirano, Imbens, and Ridder (2003). In cross-sectional studies of causal e¤ects of Bernoulli
interventions, (8) is known as an average treatment e¤ ect. Our setup allows for multinomial or ordered
treatments.1
The estimand described by (8) is similar to that approximated using local linear projections in Jordà
(2005), though here no approximation is required.

The estimand can also be related to the nonlinear

impulse response function introduced by Gallant, Rossi and Tauchen (1993). The latter is based on
estimation of E [yt+l jxt ] where xt = (yt ; :::; yt

p)

and yt is assumed to be a Markov process. An impulse

response function can then be de…ned as a marginalized version of E yt+l jx+
t

E [yt+l jxt ] where x+
t

perturbs yt by a constant. Although E [yt+l jxt ] is in principal nonparametrically identi…ed, extrapolation
to counterfactual E yt+l jx+
in the Gallant, Rossi and Tauchen (1993) framework is likely to require a
t

model for the conditional expectation of outcomes.

Our approach leans on parametric policy models but requires no functional form assumptions for the

With Bernoulli treatments, the formulation in (8) re‡ects Rosenbaum and Rubin’s (1983) propensity score theorem,
which says that if potential outcomes are independent of treatment conditional on covariates, they’re also independent of

multinomial treatments as well.

innovations for the policy process, nor develop, solve, or simulate a model for the joint process governing
outcomes yt ; policy variables Dt , and covariates zt : The estimator based on (8) is an easily constructed

A Propensity Score for Monetary Policy Interventions

The federal funds market is an interbank loan market intended for the management of reserve requirements; the rate for overnight loans in this market, known as the federal funds rate, provides a benchmark
for securities across the risk and maturity spectrum. Monetary policy targeted the level of the federal
funds rate until mid-December, 2008, when the fed funds rate was set to trade between 0 and 0.25%.
With no room to lower rates further, the Fed turned to other tools, such as large scale asset purchases.
We focus here on the pre-2009 policy era, going back to July 1989. Because FOMC meetings are very
nearly a monthly occurrence, we work with monthly data.

3.1

The Federal Funds Rate Targeting Regime

Since February 1994, fed funds targets have been announced after each FOMC meeting, eight times a
year.2 Changes in the target usually come in 25 basis-point increments in a [-0.50%, 0.50%] interval,
though the target was twice changed by 75 basis points in our sample period.

Of the 78 target rate

changes in our sample, 23 were outside of an FOMC meeting. Most of these happened before February
1994. On three occasions there was more than one change in a given month, in which case we sum them.3
The space of possible policy choices is de…ned here to be {-0.50%, -0.25%, 0%, 0.25%, 0.50% }, where
the

0.50% events include the larger changes.
Our sample is determined in part by the availability of policy predictors derived from …nancial deriv-

atives based on the federal funds rate.

One such derivative, federal funds rate futures (FFF) started

trading in earnest in 1989 (the market was established earlier, in 1988). We consider two sample endpoints. July 2005 marks the last in a series of increases in the fed funds target. From then on, the
target rate remained at 5.25% until September 2007 before the Great Recession began. We use July
2005 as a …rst sample end-point for estimation of the propensity score and evaluate policy responses up
to 24 months ahead on data running to July 2007. The target fell gradually thereafter, until December
2008 when it hovered between zero and 0.25%, marking the end of conventional monetary policy. The
second sample end-point for propensity score estimation therefore extends through the end of 2008 with
an additional 24 months ending in December 2010 used to estimate policy responses. Finally, we also
experiment separately with data from the Great Recession period only. This is a small sample and it
imposes some limits to the experiments we can conduct that we will discuss below.

3.2

Policy Predictors for the Propensity Score

E¢ cient markets price futures contracts using all available information. This motivates students of monetary policy to de…ne policy shocks as deviations from the optimal predictions implicit in asset prices.
2

The FOMC comprises the Fed Chairman and six other Board Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York and a rotating pool of four presidents from the remaining eleven regional Federal Reserve Banks.
3
The relevant months are December 1990, December 1991, and January 2001.

9

Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002), for example, use changes in the Eurodollar rate around meeting dates to
de…ne target rate surprises, while Thapar (2008) uses T-Bill futures in a similar manner. Kuttner (2001),
Faust, Swanson and Wright (2004), Gürkaynak, Sack and Swanson (2005, 2007), Bernanke and Kuttner
(2005) and Wingender (2011) construct monetary policy shocks from …nancial derivatives that price the
federal funds rate directly.4
Federal funds rate derivatives include a futures contract on the e¤ective federal funds rate and an
options contract on these futures (though the latter started only in 2003). Futures contracts refer to
calendar-month averages of the e¤ective federal funds rate published by the New York Fed, with spot,
and one- through …ve-month contracts. We use these derivatives to predict target changes, implicitly
de…ning policy surprises as deviations from market-based forecasts of Federal Reserve behavior.
The intuitive notion that futures prices provide an optimal policy forecast can be made rigorous using
Piazzesi’s (2005) term structure model. Denote the information available to policy makers at time t by
t.

Piazzesi shows that bond yields and related derivatives likewise depend on

assumption that pricing functions are invertible, we can replace

t;

t.

Under the additional

which may be only partially observable,

with a vector of observed asset prices zt . This theoretical argument is ‡eshed out in the appendix.
As a practical matter, our analysis distinguishes between months with scheduled FOMC meetings
("meeting months") and months without. In meeting months, we construct s1t , the di¤erence between
the price of the futures contract expiring during the same month as the meeting and the current target
rate, both observed at market close on the day before the meeting. In non-meeting months, we construct
s0t , the di¤erence between the price of a one-month-ahead contract in that month and the target rate in
e¤ect on the last day of the previous month.
With a few exceptions, our predictor for meeting months is s1t , while in non-meeting months, s0t is
used. In constructing s1t for months in the pre-1994 era, before target rate changes were announced, our
coded announcement date is delayed by one day relative to the later period. Before 1994, the market
became aware of a target change only through a reading of the open market operations implemented by
the New York Fed’s Trading Desk. These operations take place at the beginning of the trading day and
hence are observed the day after a meeting, which generally concludes after the close of the market. This
nuance a¤ects the construction of s1t only.
In a few instances, target rate changes in meeting months preceded meetings, with an additional
change or no change at the meeting, as in February, March, and August 1991. In such situations, the
predictor is taken to be s0t rather than s1t and enters as its own covariate. The active futures variable for
any given month is denoted F F Ft , equal to either s0t or s1t , as described above.
Because target changes are naturally ordered in 0.25% increments over the range

0:50%, we model

the policy propensity score with an ordered probit speci…cation. Hamilton and Jordà (2002) and Scotti
(2011) likewise use ordered probit to model federal funds rate target changes. The dependent variable

is the change in the target rate during month m + 1; irrespective of whether an FOMC meeting was
announced or whether the target was changed. For the few occasions where more than one target change
occurred in the same month, recall that we use the accumulated monthly change.
We allow the coe¢ cients of the propensity score to vary after August 2006 to capture a window that
includes the …nancial crisis with about a one year lead time.5 Since there were no instances of changes
prior to meetings after 2001, the predictor for that scenario only enters in the pre-crisis data.
In addition to controlling for market expectations through fed funds futures prices, we include and the
unemployment rate, such as might appear in a conventional monetary policy rule. The unemployment
rate is available at a monthly frequency and is a natural substitute for output gap measures commonly
used with quarterly data. Moreover, our "Taylor Rule" speci…cation can be motivated by results of
Blanchard and Galí (2010) and Galí (2011) who show that the optimal monetary policy rule in a New
Keynesian model with real-wage rigidities depends both on in‡ation and unemployment. Finally, the
speci…cation of the propensity score includes a number of terms designed to capture a variety of calendar
e¤ects. These include a dummy variable FOMCt indicating months with a scheduled FOMC meeting,
the target change in the previous month, the target rate change in the previous month interacted with
FOMC, a scale factor that accounts for when within the month the FOMC meeting is scheduled, and a
set of monthly seasonal dummies. We also include the variable CRISISt , a dummy that takes the value
of 1 starting August 2006 to capture a window that includes the …nancial crisis with about a one year
lead time. Finally, the model includes dummies for the Y2K event and the September 11, 2001 attacks.6
Table 1 reports average marginal e¤ects of the e¤ects of predictors on the likelihood of a 0.25%
increase in the target.

These estimates use the sample through July 2005 for the pre-crisis sample (July

1989 to July 2005) and through December 2008 for the full sample (July 1989 to December 2008). Since
responses are calculated by shifting the outcome variable up to two years forward, we note that the end
dates for the outcome samples are July 2007 and December 2010, respectively.
Estimates of a benchmark Taylor-type speci…cation that predicts target rate changes with in‡ation
and unemployment alone are reported in columns (1) and (2). These are labeled OPT 1 and OPT 2 and use
the pre-crisis sample. Columns (5) and (6), report estimates for OPT 1 and OPT 2 using the full sample.
Broadly speaking, the estimates show that both variables a¤ect policy largely as expected, though the
negative unemployment e¤ect is stronger than the very small positive in‡ation e¤ect. The latter is not
statistically signi…cant. The Taylor model estimates shown in columns (1) and (5) (labeled OPT 1 ) use
same-month measures only, while the estimates reported in columns (2) and (6) (labeled OPT 2 ) are from
models that add in‡ation and unemployment lags, the size of the last target change, and seasonal and
scheduling dummies.7

Columns (3) and (4) for the short sample and columns (7) and (8) for the long sample, labeled OPF 1
and OPF 2 report estimates from speci…cations that include F F Ft terms that di¤er in meeting and nonmeeting months, and in the pre-crisis and full samples. The results indicate that market-based factors
are better predictors of target rate changes than the combination of in‡ation and unemployment and
their lags in a Taylor speci…cation. The pseudo-R2 s in columns (3) and (7) (OPF 1 ), based on estimates
of the policy propensity score using these factors but excluding in‡ation and unemployment terms are
virtually identical to the pseudo-R2 s from the speci…cations augmented with these Taylor model terms
and reported in columns (4) and (8) (OPF 2 ). Neither in‡ation nor unemployment marginal e¤ects are
signi…cantly di¤erent from zero when estimated in the more elaborate models.
Fitted values from the full policy score model (8) seem to track realized shifts well over the course of
the business cycle. This can be seen in Figure 1, which plots actual and predicted target changes (i.e.,
the expected target change conditional on regressors in the policy propensity score). Predictions were
computed using the OPF 2C estimates from column (8) of Table 1. The …gure also shows the time series
of Industrial Production (IP) growth to mark cyclical ‡uctuations.
An important diagnostic for our purposes looks at whether lagged macro aggregates are independent
of policy changes conditional on the policy propensity score. In other words we would like to show
that the policy shocks implicitly de…ned by our score model look to be "as good as randomly assigned".
Angrist and Kuersteiner (2011) develop semiparametric tests that can be used for this purpose. Panel
A of Table 2 reports test results for the null hypothesis of orthogonality between the policy innovation,
fDt = dj g

pj (zt ; ), and conditioning variables in the model. Panel B looks at the correlation between

innovations and lagged outcomes. Both panels show p-values for joint (3 df ) tests of the null hypothesis

that the score model indicated in the column headings is an adequate speci…cation of the conditional
probability that the target rate is unchanged, rises by a quarter point, or falls by a quarter point (these
are the shocks analyzed below). The table also shows p-values for joint orthogonality of an aggregate
market based factor FFFt . We consider linear and quadratic terms of FFFt (2

3 = 6 df ).

Test results for the simple Taylor model (reported in columns labelled OPT 1 ) show substantial correlation with economic variables, including the lagged federal funds rate. The addition of controls for
in‡ation and unemployment lags, the size of the last target change, and seasonal and scheduling dummies
generates better results, although these p-values (reported in columns labelled OPT 2 ) still show some evidence of correlation between FFFt and the average federal funds rate with policy innovations, especially
in the longer sample. Test results for the model with FFFt alone (reported in columns labelled OPF 1 ) all
pass, contrary to those for the expanded Taylor model, OPT 2 . Similarly, test results for the model that
includes both FFFt and in‡ation and unemployment terms (reported in columns labeled OPF 2 ) o¤er no
evidence against the hypothesis of random policy innovations.

In what follows, we proceed using the

4

Dynamic Policy E¤ects

The yield curve is the proximate channel through which target rate changes a¤ect in‡ation and the real
economy. We therefore begin with an analysis of policy e¤ects on the yield curve, speci…cally, the federal
funds, 3-month T-Bill, and 2- and 10-year T-Bond rates.

In addition to the yield curve, we look at

e¤ects on in‡ation measured by the change in 100 times the log of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the
response in the change of 100 times the log of the Industrial Production (IP) index, and the response
in the change of the unemployment rate. Policy responses refer to the percentage point change in the
outcome variable measured from the month of the policy intervention out to the relevant horizon.
Our analysis shows the impact of 25 basis point changes, up and down, out to a horizon of 24 months.
Figures 2, 3 and 4 plot these estimated responses, constructed using propensity score model OPF 2=C in
columns (4) and (8) of Table 1. The …gures also show 90% con…dence bands.
The federal funds rate responds more sharply to increases in the target rate than to decreases, as
can be seen in Figure 2 A 25 basis point (bps) increase in the target appears to spark a sequence of
further changes that induces a peak increase in the federal funds rate close to 1 percentage point (pp)
after about a year, then falling to half a percentage point after two years. This pattern is similar to that
found in VAR-type estimates (e.g., Figure 3 in Christiano et al. 1999, when cumulated). By contrast, a
25 bps reduction lowers the federal funds rate by -0.50 pp one year out, a decline that’s sustained after
two years.
Estimated causal e¤ects of a change in target yields are shown in Figure 3. As we might expect,
rate increases move through the yield curve with diminished intensity as maturities lengthen. A similar
pattern appears in estimates reported by Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002). The estimated yield curve
response to a rate decrease goes the other way and is somewhat more muted, as can be seen in the
right-hand column of the …gure. This relatively ‡at response is consistent with the ‡atter response of
the federal funds rate in the bottom of Figure 2. The relative insensitivity of the yield curve to target
rate decreases provides a possible explanation for weak transmission of accommodative monetary policy
changes to macro aggregates.
Responses of macroeconomic aggregates to monetary policy changes appear in Figure 4. The top row
displays the responses of the change in 100 times the log of the price level; the second row reports e¤ects
on 100 times the change in the log of IP; the third row shows e¤ects on the change in the unemployment
rate. Target rate increases begin to reduce in‡ation after about 18 months. After two years, a quarter
point increase in the target is estimated to have reduced prices by about a quarter point, equivalent to a
reduction of just over a tenth of a point in the annual in‡ation rate. Interestingly, these results show no
evidence of a "price puzzle," that is, a short-run increase in in‡ation when rates rise. The price puzzle
is a common …nding in VAR-based estimates of the e¤ects of monetary shocks (see, e.g., Sims, 1992)
Industrial Production is largely invariant to a rate increase in the …rst post-change year, but then falls
to a net decline of about 1.5 pps after two years. This is roughly a 0.75 pp decrease in annual growth

13

rates. The unemployment rate response essentially mirrors this, with a total increase of about a quarter
point after two years. Estimated responses of IP and the unemployment rate to target rate reductions
emerge only slowly and are modest when they do. This di¤erence, documented in the right-hand column
of Figure 3, seems likely to re‡ect the relatively muted response of the federal funds rate and the yield
curve to reductions in the target rate. Although the e¤ect of target rate changes is about equal, up or
down, when looking two years out, the fed funds rate and yield curve are markedly more sensitive to rate
increases than to rate decreases at intermediate horizons. Di¤erences in the responses to up and down
changes therefore seem likely to re‡ect a weaker "…rst stage" for the policy intervention, though we can’t
rule out di¤erences in policy sensitivity on the upside and downside as well. This strong asymmetry in
yield curve and macro aggregate responses to US monetary policy shifts echoes …ndings in Hamilton and
Jordà (2002) and Angrist and Kuersteiner (2011), but does not feature in most VAR-based estimates.
Other Comparisons and Context
In an in‡uential study of the e¤ects of monetary policy shocks on the yield curve and macro variables,
Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002) report estimates of policy e¤ects on the yield curve similar to ours. On
the other had, their results show little e¤ect of policy changes on prices, while suggesting employment
increases after a rate increase. The yield curve e¤ects reported here are stronger than the VAR-based
responses reported in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996, 1999).
Faust, Swanson and Wright (2004) use policy-induced changes in federal funds futures price to quantify
policy shocks. Their VAR-based estimates of the e¤ect of a positive 25 basis point surprise show price
decreases similar to those reported here. The corresponding estimated e¤ects on output line up less well,
however, with a mixture of positive and negative e¤ects.
As a theoretical matter, monetary models with nominal rigidities, information asymmetries, menu
costs, or lending constraints typically imply asymmetric responses to monetary policy interventions. For
example, Cover (1992) and DeLong and Summers (1988) argue that contractionary monetary policy
a¤ects real variables more than expansionary policy does. Using international data, Karras (1996) …nds
strong evidence of asymmetry in the e¤ects of monetary policy on output using European data. These
papers are consistent with Keynes’ (1936) observations on the role of sticky wages in business cycles
(see Ravn and Sola, 2004 for a review of the relevant history of thought in this context). More recently
Tenreyro and Thwaites (2013), using Romer and Romer (2004) monetary policy shocks, report that
monetary policy e¤ectiveness declines in recessions.

Crisis Intervention

Did the Great Recession change the e¤ects of monetary policy? This section addresses this question by
…rst extending the sample to cover target rate changes through the end of 2008, with outcomes measured
through the end of 2010 and then by analyzing policy changes for the early crisis period only (October
14

2006 to December 2008), with outcomes measured through December 2009 (one year earlier than the
full-sample analysis as we limit the horizon to 12 months for the crisis sample).
Figure 5 shows the estimated response of the federal funds rate in the longer sample (the …rst of our
two experiments). These estimates are similar to those shown in Figure 2, with the response to a target
increase peaking slightly above 1 pp after 18 months, falling to a little over half a point two years out.
The estimated response to a target decrease is slightly less persistent than in the shorter sample, ending
the two-year horizon with a decline of only a quarter point rather than a half.
Estimated term rate responses are plotted in Figure 6.

These show a slightly sharper yield curve

response to rate increases, while the response to target rate reductions is, if anything, even more muted
than that for the pre-crisis sample. The estimated e¤ects in panels on the right hand side of Figure 6 are
remarkably ‡at, consistent with the ‡atter response of the fed funds rate to target rate declines plotted
in Figure 5.
Macro aggregate responses in the longer sample, reported in Figure 7, show little e¤ect of a target
rate change on in‡ation. Estimated e¤ects of rate increases on IP suggest less of a decline in response
to rate increases than that estimated for the short sample, with a decline of just over 1 pp after two
years (versus 1.5 pps in the shorter sample). The unemployment rate response to a rate increase is also
somewhat smaller than that found in the shorter sample, while target rate declines are again estimated
to have little e¤ect on any macro aggregate.
Our short "crisis sample" saw no target rate increases, so the analysis of this sample models policy
changes as any rate decrease of 25 bps or more.

The policy propensity score used for this is a probit

function of the combined futures variable, along with in‡ation and unemployment (the Taylor variables
used for the policy model estimated in the longer sample). The resulting marginal e¤ects, reported in
Table 3, are normalized to show the impact on the probability the target rate is left unchanged, so
the signs align with the ordered estimates reported earlier.

As with the ordered score model, column

(3) in Table 3 shows FFF to be a strong predictor of target rate changes.

Though the coe¢ cient on

in‡ation is marginally signi…cant (and wrong-signed) in column (3), overall, in‡ation and unemployment
add little to policy prediction conditional on FFF, a …nding that emerges by comparing the log likelihood
in columns (2) and (3). The F -statistic is 1.98 with a p-value of 0.14. Finally, a model with in‡ation
and unemployment alone does not predict target rate decreases as well as a model with only FFF, as
can be seen in a comparison of likelihoods across columns (1) and (2). In fact, in the short crisis sample,
traditional Taylor Rule variables are essentially unrelated to target rate declines. The F -statistic between
columns (1) and (3) is 14.52 with a p-value of nearly 0, suggesting that the term FFF is doing the heavy
lifting.
Figure 8 shows the estimated response of the federal funds rate to target rate changes using only
the crisis period. The results show large but highly imprecisely estimated declines in the federal funds
rate. Part of the increase in magnitude here may be due to the fact that the policy dummy in this case
indicates a combination of quarter-point and half-point declines.
15

Figure 9 plots term rate responses to policy interventions in the crisis sample. The estimates o¤er
some evidence that federal funds rate declines are passed down the yield curve in the form of a pattern
reasonably consistent with that found when estimated using more data. Finally, Figure 10 reports the
responses of the macro variables. Here too the estimates are imprecise. Although inconclusive, they o¤er
little support for the view that monetary stimulus was e¤ective in the crisis period.

Summary and Conclusions

We start with the assumption that policy changes are independent of potential outcomes, conditional on
observed market-based forecasts of these changes plus a small set of economic predictors. Selection-onobservables is a strong assumption, but a natural starting point. We then consider how best to make use
of the selection-on-observables identi…cation condition in a potential outcomes framework. The resulting
propensity score weighting estimator captures possibly nonlinear and asymmetric causal responses to an
ordered dynamic treatment through a simple reweighting procedure. Our framework focuses modeling
e¤ort and speci…cation testing on the process that determines policy decision; the model for outcomes is
left unspeci…ed.
Our propensity score weighting estimator for ordered time series treatments is applied to evaluate
the e¤ect of monetary policy interventions on macroeconomic outcomes before and during the Great
Recession. Results for the pre-recession period suggest an asymmetric response to changes in the fed
funds rate target, much as implied by the string metaphor. Our …ndings suggest that target rate increases
reduce in‡ation, employment and output. At the same time, target decreases appear to have little e¤ect
on output or in‡ation. Perhaps surprisingly, an extension of our analysis to cover the "zero lower bound
years" since 2008 leaves these …ndings essentially unchanged.
What explains the asymmetric response of macro aggregates to monetary policy interventions? An
important …nding emerging from the analysis reported here is the weak e¤ect of target rate declines on
medium and long term bond rates. Because changes in these rates provide a plausible causal channel
for policy, the relative unresponsiveness of these bond rates to policy may account for much of the
weak impact of target rate reductions on macro aggregates.

At the same time, the limited precision

of many of our estimates means we can’t rule out di¤erential sensitivity of macro aggregates to bond
yield declines and hikes. In view of this constellation of …ndings, suggesting though not establishing a
"weak channels" hypothesis for asymmetric policy e¤ects, in future work, we plan to use the econometric
methods developed here to analyze the e¤ects of the Fed’s recent large scale asset purchases. These
interventions were designed to reduce the long end of the yield curve in the face of exceptionally low
short-term rates.

A

Asset Price Based Policy Predictions

Our formulation of the propensity score is based on Piazzesi’s (2005) term structure model. Piazzesi
(2005) provides an explicit parametric framework that links Fed-policy actions to the yield curve. Her
model consists of a monetary policy rule pj ( t ; ) ; the probability of choosing Dt = dj ; conditional on
information

t.

Monetary policy then a¤ects the state price density Mt and consequently, through no-

arbitrage arguments, the yield curve. The key insight of Piazzesi’s model that is relevant here is the fact
that asset prices, in particular bond yields and related derivatives, depend on the same state vector

t

as

j

the policy function p ( t ; ). Under the additional assumption that the pricing functions are invertible,
we can recover
in

t

t

with a vector of asset prices. This is particularly appealing because some of the elements

may not be directly observable.

We rely on a no-arbitrage pricing relationship between the price of zero coupon bonds as well as a
federal funds futures contract and the state vector

t:

Let the state price density Mt be such that the price

at time t of a random payo¤ V at time T is E [MT V j t ] =Mt = ETQ [V ] where ETQ [V ] is the expectation

operator with respect to the risk neural measure. Harrison and Kreps (1979) show that the existence of
a state price density is essentially equivalent to the existence of an equilibrium price system, something
we impose as an assumption. Using the risk neutral measure, random payo¤s at various maturities are
priced as
PVT (t; T j t ) = ETQ [V j t ] :
We assume that the relationship between the state vector

t

(12)

and (12) is invertible, an assumption that is

satis…ed for example in a¢ ne models. Let zt = PV1 (t; T1 j t ) ; :::; PVq (t; Tq j t ) be a vector of observed

price data with maturities T1 ; ::; Tq and assume that the pricing function has an inverse g such that
t

= g (zt ; t; T1 ; :::; Tq ) :

(13)

The technique of inverting the yield curve to elicit unobservable state variables is well established in the
…nancial econometrics literature –see Söderlind and Svensson (1997), Singleton (2001) or Piazzesi (2005)
for examples. Our empirical model for the propensity score is related to the policy function by
pj (zt ; ) := pj (g (zt ; t; T1 ; :::; Tq ) ; ) :

(14)

Federal funds futures maturing shortly after FOMC announcements are probably good candidates for zt .
The reason is that there is a direct link between their expected future cash ‡ow and changes in the federal
funds target rate. We focus on the case where no FOMC meeting is announced. Because macroeconomic
data is released at di¤erent days throughout the month and because we are interested in good predictors
of expected Fed policy for the entire month m + 1, we concentrate our attention on the futures price on
the last day of the prior month m; that is, tm : Let ft1

m ;m

17

denote the price of a one-month ahead contract

traded at the last day of month m and let

m

be the total number of days in month m. On any given

day tj in month m + 1, let rtj be the e¤ective federal funds rate at the close of the market.8 The payo¤

for a buyer of a fed funds futures contract is the di¤erence between the futures rate ft;m

(15)

with the payo¤ cash settled the day after expiration of the futures contract (see Piazzesi and Swanson,
2008, p. 679). Pricing equation (12) and (15) imply that the spread between a funds future ft1

and

the prevailing target rate rtm at the last day tm of month m is

rtm =

re‡ects both uncertainty about whether and when a target rate change

will occur in month m+1 and more general uncertainty about the economy captured by the pricing kernel
Mt : Equation (16) shows that the futures-target rate spread is the best risk adjusted predictor of a target
rate change during the coming month.9 Whether (16) can be inverted to recover
on the dimension of

t

tm

as in (13) depends

as well as the exact functional form of the conditional expectations. In the absence

of an explicit pricing model, which would require a more parametric framework than we are willing to
entertain, it is ultimately an empirical question whether controlling for ft1

m ;m

rtm in the propensity

score is su¢ cient.
