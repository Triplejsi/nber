Limited Managerial Attention and Corporate Aging
Claudio Loderer, René Stulz, and Urs Waelchli
NBER Working Paper No. 19428
September 2013
JEL No. G30,L20
ABSTRACT
As firms have more assets in place, more of management’s limited attention is focused on managing
assets in place rather than developing new growth options. Consequently, as firms grow older, they
have fewer growth options and a lower ability to generate new growth options. This simple theory
predicts that Tobin’s q falls with age. Further, competition in the product market is expected to slow
down the decrease in Tobin’s q because it forces firms to look for alternative sources of rents. Similarly,
greater competition in the labor market reduces the decrease in Tobin’s q with age because old firms
are in a better position to hire employees that can help with innovation. In contrast, competition in
the market for corporate control should accelerate the decline because it forces management to focus
more on managing assets in place whose performance is more directly observable than on developing
growth options where results may not be observable for some time. We find strong support for these
predictions in tests using exogenous variation in competition.

Why is it that older firms are worth less? Existing theories emphasize the fact that firms use up
their growth opportunities and that their prospects become less uncertain (Pastor and Veronesi (2003)).
However, these theories do not explain why firms cannot keep acquiring new growth opportunities and
renew themselves. They also apply most forcefully to firms that went recently public. Yet, as we
show, firm valuations measured by Tobin’s q (estimated as the ratio of the market value of the firm’s
assets divided by their book value) fall by roughly 1% per year for firms that are older than five years
since the IPO. In this paper, we develop and test a simple theory that explains why firms become less
good at creating growth opportunities as they age and, therefore, helps us to better understand the
effect of age on firm investment policies and valuation.
With our theory, management cannot devote as much attention to developing growth opportunities
as the firm ages. Management has a finite amount of time to devote to managing a firm. At the top of
the firm, the CEO’s time is a binding constraint on his ability to pay attention and to manage different
areas within the firm he leads. Before a firm goes public, management dedicates much of its time to
developing growth options as the firm has few assets in place, and its ability to go public will
generally depend on its prospects rather than on its assets in place. Firms go public to monetize these
growth options and to raise funds to exercise them. Once a firm becomes public, management
optimally spends more time managing its assets in place as the firm exercises its growth options and
has to meet investors’ expectations. The greater focus on assets in place means that less attention is
devoted to developing new growth options. Therefore, as a firm ages, it has fewer growth options and
becomes poorer at developing such options.
Any theory of Tobin’s q that endows the firm with growth options that it exercises optimally over
time concludes that Tobin’s q falls as these growth options are exercised. However, such a theory
cannot explain why firms do not replace these growth options. As assets in place increase, the firm has
to develop more valuable growth options just to stay in place in terms of its Tobin’s q. Hence, for the
firm to keep developing growth options that allow its Tobin’s q to stay constant, the CEO would have
to give more attention to growth options, which is not possible as assets in place increasingly require
her attention. As a result, a firm is very unlikely to ever replace the growth options that it had in its
youth. We find strong support for this prediction. More specifically, adjusting q for calendar-year and
1

industry effects, only 30% of the sample firms ever exceed the maximum q they reach during the first
four years after listing. These findings could, in principle, reflect an IPO effect. Jain and Kini (1994),
for example, find that operating performance deteriorates after the IPO. Moreover, Loughran and
Ritter (1995), among others, document that the stock of newly listed firms underperforms significantly
in the years after the IPO (see, however, Fama (1998)). Yet the same results obtain when we exclude
firms younger than 10 years, and when we measure age relative to the date of incorporation rather than
to that of listing. Hence, the evidence is distinct from a pure IPO effect.
Competition in the market for corporate control means that management has to focus on managing
well assets in place since poor performance of assets in place is readily observable while the
performance of management in generating growth opportunities that have yet to manifest themselves
is much harder to assess. Therefore, we would expect firms to age more quickly, i.e., to have fewer
growth options, and hence a lower Tobin’s q, if there is more competition in the market for corporate
control. This prediction can be tested using exogenous changes in the degree of competition in the
market for corporate control. Using the state adoption of business combination laws that restrict
competition in the market for corporate control, we show in a difference-in-differences setting that
Tobin’s q falls more slowly with age for firms incorporated in states where such laws are put in place.
Product market competition lowers the value of the firm’s assets in place. Escaping competition
and regaining rents is a major motivation for firms to focus on innovation. This “escape competition”
motive for innovation has been formalized in Aghion, Harris, Howitt, and Vickers’ (2001) endogenous
growth model, among others. It is also consistent with recent studies that find that competition spurs
growth (Asker, Farre-Mensa, and Ljungqvist (2013); Fogel, Morck, and Yeung (2008)) and innovation
(Bernstein (2012)). If product market competition makes the assets in place less valuable, we would
expect the CEO to spend more time on creating new growth opportunities for the firm’s core
competences and less time on managing assets in place. Therefore, older firms in a competitive
industry should be relatively better at creating new growth opportunities than their peers in noncompetitive industries. To test this prediction, we use the industry concentration index suggested by
Hoberg and Phillips (2011) to identify firms that operate in a more competitive environment.
Consistent with our prediction, we find that the age effect is lower for firms in competitive industries.
2

The result is not driven by the fact that firms in non-competitive industries start with higher q ratios
and therefore experience a sharper decline over time.
One possible concern with this result is that the degree of competition could be endogenously
determined. Firms with abnormally high q ratios tend to attract competitors, particularly in industries
with low barriers to entry. This could reduce q ratios over time as well. To address this endogeneity
issue, we look at industries that experienced exogenous competitive shocks, namely large reductions in
import tariffs, during the sample period. Lower tariffs should intensify product market competition.
The data are from Frésard and Valta (2012). Tariff reductions should be exogenous to corporate
policies (see also Guadalupe and Wulf (2010)). Consistent with the notion that firms age less quickly
in a competitive environment, the age effect shrinks significantly after tariff reductions.
Exogenous variation in labor markets provides another way to test the implications of our theory.
Young firms are firms with growth options. They face the risk that employees will defect and take
knowledge with them that is relevant to these growth options. In contrast, old firms that have focused
on assets in place will lack employees that could help them innovate. We would therefore expect laws
that restrict employee mobility to be valuable for young firms but hurt old firms. Hence, we would
expect firms to age more quickly in states where non-competition agreements are more strongly
enforced. We find that this is the case.
It is much easier to evaluate whether management is doing well at managing assets in place than at
developing new growth options. Firms disclose data that enable investors to compute a wide range of
metrics to assess management’s performance at managing assets in place. Most simply, investors can
estimate the profitability of these assets. Management’s efforts at developing new growth options
typically involve R&D investments, which are notoriously difficult to evaluate from outside the firm
(Edmans, Heinle, and Huang (2013)). Further, it is often the case that management cannot disclose the
progress made through these investments because doing so it would provide valuable proprietary
information to competitors (Verrecchia (1983)). Financial analysts, shareholders, and media
monitoring the firm will find it more difficult to assess management’s performance in generating
growth options than in assessing its performance managing assets in place. Hence, outside monitoring
will focus management’s attention more on assets in place than on generating growth options (see also
3

Edmans, Heinle, and Huang (2013)). Management will also be more focused on preventing bad
surprises from assets in place, which will lead it to develop mechanisms within the firm that control
the performance of assets in place more tightly. In particular, rules are adopted to economize on
managerial attention. While such mechanisms are helpful for the performance of assets in place, they
make innovation within the firm more difficult as they reduce the discretion of employees within the
firm.
Our arguments are related to those advanced by Holmstrom (1989). When firms go public to fund
the exercise of growth options, they become larger, more complex organizations. In larger firms,
according to Holmstrom, it is difficult to provide incentives for such different activities as
production/marketing and innovation. To reap the financial rewards from their growth opportunities,
listed firms therefore rationally rely more on rigid rules as a substitute for incentives. This
compromises the willingness to experiment and innovate, and screens out innovative personalities. In
addition, listed firms are more dependent on the capital markets and are therefore more concerned
about their reputation. Concern about funding, according to Holmstrom, has a tendency to make larger
firms myopic in their behavior and therefore less concerned about innovation. If they do invest, one
could argue, insiders have an incentive to pursue incremental innovation projects because they have a
higher probability of early success and are more easily understood by investors (Ferreira, Manso, and
Silva (2012)). Incremental projects are tied to the lifecycle of the firm’s products and therefore
represent sources of growth opportunities that are limited in time.
At older firms, assets in place receive more attention than at younger firms. We therefore expect
assets in place to be well-managed at such firms. The older firm becomes much more focused on being
the best at what it does instead of being focused on developing new activities. However, this focus
means that the firm will be less likely to innovate successfully. As its ability to innovate falls, it
becomes less advantageous for the firm to try to innovate. Hence, we expect older firms to invest less
in R&D and to become less likely to try to develop new businesses. These older firms will
increasingly pay out their excess cash flows because they lack positive net present value projects. Our
evidence supports these predictions. We find that the firms that become older do not become less
efficient or more poorly managed. However, they spend less on R&D, invest less in capital
4

expenditures, and pay out more. Well-known specific older firms in our sample seem to be firms that
fit our theory. For instance, in 2009, these firms include Alcoa, Coca Cola, Dow Chemical, General
Dynamics, Hershey, McDonald’s, Pepsi, and Procter & Gamble. These firms are older and focused,
and have comparatively lower growth opportunities.
There are several potential alternative explanations for the fact that old firms have lower Tobin’s q
ratios. The first one is that young firms are credit constrained. For a credit constrained firm, marginal q
will be high. As the firm becomes less credit constrained, its marginal q falls. If marginal q is a
declining function of the level of total past capital expenditures, we expect average q to exceed
marginal q and to also decline. Hence, old firms that are not constrained will have a lower Tobin’s q.
To minimize the importance of this problem, most of our empirical work considers only firms that are
at least five-years old. More importantly, we show that credit constraints cannot explain why firms that
pay out cash to their shareholders (dividends or share buybacks) experience the same decline in
Tobin’s q ratios over time as other firms.
Another possible explanation is provided by agency theory. In a narrow sense, the explanation is
that management is more likely to be entrenched in older firms so that for the same assets shareholders
expect lower cash flows for older firms than for newer firms. With this explanation, management
consumes more private benefits in older firms. Even though executive stock ownership is lower in
older firms, and boards are larger, we find little evidence to support this implication. Management
does not have more abnormal compensation in older firms. Further, older firms have greater payouts
on average. Finally, the agency explanation of the decline in Tobin’s q ratios over time cannot explain
why firms that face less competition in the market for corporate control see their q ratios fall less
quickly.
A broader version of the agency explanation is that entrenchment grows at many levels of the
corporation and is not attached to individuals but to business units of the corporation. With this view,
business units protect their turf, so that they prevent units with valuable growth opportunities from
taking advantage of them (e.g., Scharfstein and Stein (2000); Rajan, Servaes, and Zingales (2000)). In
other words, internal capital markets become less efficient as firms become older. This broader agency
theory is not completely distinct from our theory of managerial attention. As the firm becomes more
5

established, managers have to cater more to established units within the firm. However, this theory is
hard to reconcile with our evidence that firms do not generally become less efficient in their core
activities. Rather, this theory explains more why firms fail in renewing themselves through
acquisitions because existing units may make it difficult to integrate the acquired unit.
Lastly, one might argue that lifecycle theories of the firm make predictions similar to some of
those we test (Fama and French (2001); Grullon, Michaely, and Swaminathan (2002); DeAngelo,
DeAngelo, and Stulz (2006)). In particular, these theories also predict that older firms pay out more.
However, the critical difference between our paper and papers inspired by these theories is that we
develop a specific mechanism that leads older firms to differ from young ones and test this specific
mechanism. The key tests of our mechanism exploit exogenous variation in competition. These tests
have no counterpart in the literature inspired by lifecycle theories.
The paper proceeds as follows. In the first section, we expand the presentation of our theory and
derive more precisely its testable hypotheses. In Section II, we discuss the data. In Section III, we
show that Tobin’s q falls with age across industries, and firms are unlikely to ever again achieve the
Tobin’s q of their youth. We investigate the role of competition in the decrease in Tobin’s q in Section
IV. In Section V, we show that old firms are more efficient, invest less, pay out more, and are more
focused. In Section VI, we investigate whether the predictions of alternative theories of aging are
supported by the evidence. We conclude in Section VII.

I. Theoretical considerations
In this section, we present in greater detail our theory of managerial attention and show how it
leads to the hypotheses we test in the paper. We take the view that the essence of the CEO’s job is to
make choices for the firm. If he makes the right choices, the firm is more likely to do well. Otherwise,
it is more likely to struggle.
To make our ideas more concrete, we consider the simple case of a CEO who has to allocate his
time between two activities. Once he has allocated his time, these activities generate a payoff. The
payoff of an activity is positive if the CEO makes the right decisions in that activity and zero
otherwise. To make decisions, the CEO has to become informed about their consequences. The more
6

time he allocates to an activity, the more likely she is to make the right decisions. The CEO lives for
only one period. Compensation contracts that make the CEO’s compensation dependent on future
periods are assumed not to be possible.
The activities are a and b. If she makes the right choices, the firm has a payoff of A with activity a
and of B with activity b. If the CEO makes the wrong choices in an activity, the payoff of the activity
is zero. There is no way for the CEO to know for sure whether she is making the right decisions, but
the probability of making the right decisions in an activity is an increasing concave function of the
time spent on the activity. Consequently, if the time spent is e, the probability of making the right
decisions in activity a is p(e), with p'(e) > 0 and p''(e) < 0. The probability of making the right
decisions with activity b is q(e). This probability is also an increasing concave function of the time
allocated to that activity. We assume that the CEO allocates all her time, so that our model is not a
model about how hard the CEO works. The CEO has total time of L, so that she allocates L – e to
activity b. The time allocation of the CEO is not observable, so that pay cannot be a function of e.
We assume that the CEO is risk neutral and that his utility is equal to her expected income. For
simplicity, we assume that the CEO’s compensation is simply a fraction s of the firm’s payoff. With
these assumptions, the expected utility of the CEO is:
U = s*[p(e)*A + q(L – e)*B]
Solving for the CEO’s allocation of her time, the first-order condition of time allocation is:
p’(e)*A – q’(L–e)*B = 0
This optimality condition can be represented in the following figure. The vertical axis of the figure is
the marginal utility of the CEO’s effort. The intersection of the marginal utility schedules from
investing time in activity A and B yields the optimal allocation of time e* and (L – e*), respectively.
If the two activities are symmetric, the CEO splits her time in half between the two activities.
Everything else equal, the amount of time spent on an activity increases with the payoff of the activity.
Moreover, if the CEO’s time becomes more productive in an activity, say b, in that spending more
time in b increases the probability of a payoff more than if she spends that time in activity a, the CEO
allocates more time to activity b.

7

Suppose now that activity a is working on growth options and activity b is working on assets in
place. Growth options are operations that require new future investments. Their value is not reflected
in the value of assets in place. If the firm goes public to finance the exercise of its growth options, we
expect A to decline and B to increase. Hence, as the firm goes public, the CEO of the public firm
spends more time on activity B than the CEO of the private firm. However, this means that the firm
will dedicate less time to developing growth opportunities than it did when it was private. Note that
this impact of listing is not driven by the disclosure requirements and the increased investment
relations activities of public firms, nor is it caused by increased size per se. What causes the change in
CEO attention is the higher marginal benefit from the time dedicated to assets in place. This effect is
conceivably compounded by incentives for short-termist behavior brought about by a capital market
that reacts quickly to good news (Ferreira, Manso, and Silva (2012)) and by evidence of managerial
myopia (Asker, Farre-Mensa, and Ljungqvist (2013)).
As the CEO devotes less attention to developing growth opportunities, the firm will become less
successful at developing such growth opportunities, particularly in areas outside its core, and
employees focused on such activities will have less status in the firm. This endogenous “rigidity” is
compounded by a series of organizational measures, rules of conduct, and best practice the CEO
implements to take full advantage of assets in place. This evolution will also make the firm a less
attractive place of employment for individuals who work on developing growth opportunities, which
will decrease the payoff, A, of activity a. As A falls, the CEO spends even less time on activity a.
8

With this simple model, the firm becomes less successful at developing growth opportunities after
it becomes public. Growth opportunities become a smaller part of its valuation and its Tobin’s q falls.
Over time, as the payoffs of growth options fall, the firm will increasingly attract CEOs who are good
at managing assets in place rather than creating growth options. It follows that the firm will become
increasingly efficient in its management of assets in place but innovation will play less of a role for the
firm both because it will be optimal for its CEO to focus more assets in place and because it will not
attract CEOs focused on innovation.
A number of factors can accelerate or slow down the phenomenon we describe. To start with,
consider the impact of competition in the market for the goods the firm produces. With greater
competition, the value of B falls. In reaction, the CEO will optimally reallocate her attention and
dedicate more time to the development of growth opportunities. It follows that an increase in the
competition in the market for the goods the firm produces will slow down the decrease of Tobin’s q
with age as the firm will develop more growth opportunities.
Competition in the market for corporate control can also affect how the CEO allocates her
attention. Increased competition would seem to force the CEO to allocate her time to activities that
make a successful takeover less likely. Poor performance with assets in place is much easier to assess
than poor performance in generating growth opportunities. It is widely accepted that growth options
involve greater information asymmetries than assets in place. Further, there are costs for the firm to
disclose the current state of its efforts at generating growth opportunities. For instance, through early
disclosure, it might make it easier for other firms to imitate its efforts. Hence, it will be much easier
for the CEO to demonstrate ability by showing good performance for assets in place than through
efforts to create growth opportunities. Pressure from the market for corporate control will therefore
make it optimal for the CEO to devote more attention to assets in place than to creating growth
opportunities. Hence, such pressure will accelerate the decrease of Tobin’s q as the firm ages.
Yet another factor that should affect the allocation of the CEO’s time is labor market competition.
Young firms have the employees that enabled them to acquire growth opportunities that justified going
public. Over time, however, these employees will leave or will become less productive. If the firm is
limited in its ability to hire employees that generate growth opportunities but not employees that
9

exploit assets in place, the CEO will have fewer incentives to devote attention to that activity, so that a
firm will see its innovative activities fall more as it ages. Laws that limit labor market competition will
make it harder to hire employees with the potential to have a large impact on a firm’s growth
opportunities because the current employer of such employees will better be able to prevent them from
working for another firm. It seems reasonable to assume that employees that help the CEO exploit
assets in place will generally be easier to hire than employees who generate growth opportunities.
Hence, one would expect restrictions on labor market competition to accelerate the fall of Tobin’s q as
the firm ages.

II. Data
A. Sample Description
The sample consists of all listed firms with data on CRSP, COMPUSTAT, and COMPUSTAT
Industry Segment between 1978 and 2009. We exclude utilities as well as firms with business
segments in the financial sector (SIC 6000–6999). Similarly, we ignore firms with: (a) negative total
assets or sales; (b) missing data to compute the market capitalization of equity, or with negative
capitalization; (c) missing data on COMPUSTAT Segments; (d) cumulative sales on the
COMPUSTAT Segment tapes which deviate by more than 1% from the total sales reported on the
COMPUSTAT tapes. Since very young firms might drive the results (Fama and French (2004)), we
generally omit all firms under five. This omission, however, does not change our conclusions. The
final sample consists of 10,219 firms and 83,790 firm-years.
We start with 2,324 firms in 1978 and end with 1,738 firms in 2009. Turnover is remarkably high:
7,934 firms enter and 6,438 firms leave between 1978 and 2009. Some of the firms that drop from the
exchanges in going-private transactions may list again years later, for example in a reverse LBO. Cao
and Lerner (2009) identify 526 such transactions between 1981 and 2003. Firms that relist are
typically treated as separate firms in the literature, but this practice could bias our results. We use
Compustat’s unique identifier (gvkey) to track companies over time in spite of name or ticker changes.

10

B. Firm Age
We follow Fama and French (2001) and Pastor and Veronesi (2003) and assume that firms are
“born” in the year of their first appearance on the CRSP tapes. Consequently, firm age is the number
of years (plus one) elapsed since the year of the company’s IPO. 1 Most studies that look at firm age
use the same definition. We refer to this variable as the firm’s listing age. Shumway (2001) argues that
listing age is the economically most meaningful measure of firm age, since listing is a defining
moment in a company’s life – it affects ownership and capital structure, multiplies growth
opportunities, increases media exposure, and demands different corporate governance structures
(Loderer and Waelchli (2010)). Since CRSP goes back to 1925, the oldest a firm can be at the
beginning of our sample period in 1976 is 51 years, compared with 84 years at its end, in 2009.
Alternatively, we also compute the number of years (plus one) elapsed since the year of incorporation
and denote this variable as the firm’s incorporation age. The information is hand-collected from
Mergent Webreports as well as from Jay Ritter’s website. Throughout the investigation, Age refers to
a company’s listing age and Ageinc indicates the firm’s incorporation age.
On average, listing age is 17 years; the median is 13 (Table I). The distribution of firm age
remains fairly stable over the sample period. Incorporation age has an average value of 34 and a
median value of 25.

C. Profitability Measures and Control Variables
Table I reports descriptive statistics for all the variables in the analysis. To reduce the influence of
outliers, we winsorize all variables at the 1st and the 99th percentile of their pooled distribution. The
results, however, do not depend on this winsorization. Ownership structure and corporate-governance
data are available for only a limited subsample of firms. All definitions are in the Appendix. To assess
financial constraints (KZ index), we follow Lamont, Polk, and Saá-Requejo (2001), among others, and
estimate the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index. The results do not change when we replace that index

1

More precisely, we approximate a firm’s year of birth with the earliest of: (a) the year in which the firm
appears on CRSP; (b) the year in which the firm is included in COMPUSTAT; and (c) the year for which
we find a link between CRSP and COMPUSTAT (based on COMPUSTAT data item LINKDT). If, for
example, a firm enters CRSP or COMPUSTAT in 1996, its age is one year at the end of 1996 (1+19961996) and five years at the end of 2000 (1+2000-1996).

with alternative measures, such as a binary variable that identifies dividend payers. Except for the
correlation between listing and incorporation age, which equals 0.56, most pairwise correlation
coefficients between regressors are fairly low (not tabulated), so that there is no concern about
collinearity.

III. Firm Age and Growth Opportunities
The managerial attention hypothesis predicts that, since managers of listed firms have to dedicate
a significant amount of their time to current operations and assets in place to generate the earnings that
investors expect, their ability to innovate and create new growth opportunities is limited. Since, at the
same time, the growth opportunities available at the time of listing will be used up over time, the stock
of growth opportunities is expected to decrease as the firm ages. We test this prediction in this section.
Pastor and Veronesi (2003) show that the market-to-book ratio of a firm falls with age and falls more
rapidly early on. Our theory applies more directly to Tobin’s q and we are more concerned about firms
that have been public for a number of years. Our sample is larger than theirs because we do not have to
require a positive book value of equity as they do.

A. Decline in Tobin’s q Ratios over Time
Figure 1 shows the relation between the Tobin’s q ratio and company age implied by estimating
local polynomial regressions of the Tobin’s q ratio on firm age using an Epanechnikov kernel function
with a “rule-of-thumb” bandwidth estimator and local-mean smoothing. The advantage of this
approach is that we do not impose a functional form for how Tobin’s q changes with a firm’s age.
Figures (a) and (b) show the unconditional relation. Consistent with the hypothesis, the relation is
negative regardless of whether we measure company age from the date of listing or from that of
incorporation. We explore next whether the relation between Tobin’s q and age holds if we control for
firm characteristics. We first estimate an OLS regression with industry-year fixed-effects of Tobin’s q
on Capex, R&D, Focus, KZ-index, Leverage, Size, Volatility, and ROA. We define industries at the
three-digit SIC level. Then, we regress these residuals on incorporation age and listing age,
respectively. The resulting conditional relation between company age and Tobin’s q is negative as
12

well, no matter how we measure company age. Figures (c) and (d) show results when we control for
firm characteristics.
For a formal test of the relation between age and Tobin’s q, we estimate OLS panel regressions
with industry-year fixed-effects and firm-clustered standard errors. 2 This approach enables us to
distinguish between cohort and age effects, even though the results are qualitatively the same when we
run separate cross-sectional regressions for each year as in Pastor and Veronesi (2003) (not
tabulated). 3
The results are reported in Panel A of Table II. Regressions 1 and 2 relate to the full sample.
Consistent with the hypothesis, the coefficient of the natural logarithm of listing age is negative and
significant. So is the coefficient of the binary variable Old dummy, which identifies firms older than
the sample median in any given year. The same results obtain when we ignore firms younger than 5
years (regressions 3 and 4). Since young firms dominate the full sample, the following analysis omits,
as we already mentioned, firms younger than 5 years in terms of listing age—the exceptions will be
mentioned explicitly.
Note that, since we are controlling for firm size, our findings do not reflect declining returns to
scale. Older firms do not have lower q ratios because they are larger. The age coefficient remains
negative and significant, and essentially unchanged, when we estimate separate regressions for large
and small firms (not tabulated). 4
If listing demands increased attention to assets in place over time, the age effect we document
should be distinct from a possible age effect the company might have experienced before listing. To
test this proposition, we extend regression 3 with a variable that measures incorporation age at the time
of listing (ln(Ageinc at listing)). Previous work shows that incorporation age at listing varies
substantially over time (Jovanovic and Rousseau (2001); Fink et al. (2010)). Regression 5 shows the

2

We do not add firm fixed-effects to our standard regression because Age would be collinear with year
fixed effects (Age grows by 1 each year). In untabulated robustness tests, we replace Age with Old
dummy. In that regression, the coefficient of Old dummy remains negative and significant if we include
firm fixed-effects.
As a further control for cohort effects, we tried excluding all firms born before the start of the sample
period in 1978. That exclusion does not affect the results either (not tabulated).
In untabulated regressions, we also used alternative measures of size, including sales and the number of
employees, as well as different functional forms for the relation between size and Tobin’s q. These
choices do not affect the age effect we find.

results. ln(Ageinc at listing) is negative and significant, indicating that firms that list at a later stage of
their life cycle have fewer growth opportunities. More importantly, however, ln(Age) maintains its
negative and significant coefficient. We conclude that, consistent with our attention hypothesis, the
listing age effect is a phenomenon which differs from or is incremental to that associated with the
firm’s age prior to listing.
The coefficients of the control variables are mostly in line with the extant literature across
regression specifications. Capital expenditures, R&D outlays, focus, and volatility are associated with
larger Tobin’s q ratios (the latter result is consistent, in particular, with Pastor and Veronesi (2003)).
Firm size, however, has a positive coefficient and financial frictions, as measured with the KZ-Index,
seem to be immaterial. We also find that ROA has a negative coefficient, possibly because a high
ROA increases the opportunity costs of looking for growth opportunities. Financial leverage has a
negative coefficient.
Panel B uses the estimates of the regressions 1 (full sample) and 3 (subsample of firms older than
4) to assess the economic significance of the relation between age on Tobin’s q. Firms in the 25th
percentile of the full sample of listing age (year 4), for example, are predicted to have a q of 2.07,
compared with 1.82 if they are in the 75th percentile (year 17). Hence, a time lapse of 13 years brings
about a decline of 12 percent, or a steady annual decrease of almost 1 percent. Note that, if age is a
noisy measure of the limited managerial attention problem, these estimates will be affected by
attenuation bias.

B. Decline in Tobin’s q Ratios across Industries
It is well-known that there is an industry lifecycle (Bernstein (2012)). A concern with our results is
that they might just reflect that lifecycle. A simple approach to separate the industry lifecycle from the
firm lifecycle is to estimate our regressions within industries. We use the 48 industries identified by
Fama and French (2001) to perform this analysis. We estimate separate regressions for each of the 48
industries for which there is a sufficient number of observations (Table III). The regression
specification is the same as that in column 3 of Table II, except that, since we work with industryspecific subsamples, the only fixed effects we include are year-fixed effects. Standard errors are
14

clustered at the firm level. For simplicity, we report only the coefficient of ln(Age). We use that
coefficient to compute the impact on Tobin’s q of a change in listing age from the 25th to the 75th
percentile of the pooled distribution of age in the industry. This effect is measured relative to the
average q in the industry, and is shown for statistically significant age coefficients.
The relation between age and Tobin’s q is negative and significant at least at the 5% level for 24
out of the 38 industries we report, and it is negative and significant at the 1% level in 22 out of these
38 cases. The marginal impact of age is similar across industries, and it goes from about 5% (Office
Supplies) to 17% (Printing and Publishing). We obtain very similar results when measuring age since
incorporation. Only two industries have a positive and significant coefficient: Candy and Soda, and
Textiles. Note, however, that there are only 44 candy and soda producers and 77 textile companies in
the sample.

C. Inability to Revert to the Initial Success
The puzzling aspect of the relation between age and Tobin’s q is the fact that firms are unable to
renew their success, in spite of the fact that they can learn and that they can buy into new technologies
and markets. Table IV documents this phenomenon from a slightly different perspective. Panel A
performs an unconditional analysis of the 8,079 firms with the necessary number of observations by
comparing the maximum Tobin’s q ratios observed during the first four years after listing (denoted
with q*) with the maximum ratios observed thereafter. Consistent with the inability to renew growth
opportunities, these maximum ratios average 3.6 in younger firms compared with 3.0 in older firms.
The corresponding median values are 2.3 and 2.1, respectively. Both differences are statistically
significant with confidence at the 99% confidence level.
Following a similar logic, Figure 2 asks how likely it is that a firm will be able to exceed q* as a
function of age. To filter out common effects, we measure q as the residual from a pooled OLS
regression of Tobin’s q on industry and year fixed-effects. The figure shows that very few firms
manage to exceed their q* after year four. At age 5, for example, only 12.2% of the sample firms have
a q larger than q*. This fraction more or less gradually declines to 8.3% at age 25. Moreover, we find
that only 30% of the firms ever beat their q* (not tabulated).
15

Panel B of Table IV conducts an analysis of the ability to exceed q* with conditional logit
regressions and industry-year fixed-effects and robust standard errors. The binary dependent variable
equals 1 if the Tobin’s q of the firm in question increases beyond q* in any given year, and it equals 0
otherwise. We test whether the probability of that event, among firms that are below the maximum,
declines with age. The evidence is consistent with this prediction. The coefficient of our two measures
of age, ln(Age) and Old dummy, is negative and significant. Interestingly, there is no evidence that
research and development activities are able to slow down the decay in growth opportunities. The
coefficient of an interaction term between Old dummy and R&D is statistically zero.
These findings could be affected by survivorship bias, although that would induce a gentler
decline in average q ratios and therefore go against our hypothesis. Most firms disappear because of
takeover (Baker and Kennedy (2002)), and firms with high growth opportunities are less likely to be
taken over (Loderer and Waelchli (2013)). Hence, the best firms tend to remain, which should raise
the observed Tobin’s q ratios above the level we would measure without the exclusion of the firms that
merged or were taken over.

IV. Managerial Attention, Competition, and the Corporate Aging
The limited managerial attention hypothesis predicts that the relation between age and Tobin’s q
should be more negative when competition forces management to devote more attention to assets in
place and flatter when it makes it more advantageous for management to devote more attention to
generating growth opportunities. In particular, as discussed in Section II, greater competition in the
goods market increases the value to management from paying more attention to generating growth
opportunities, so that it makes the relation between age and Tobin’s q flatter. Similarly, management
has to pay more attention to assets in place when there is more competition in the market for corporate
control, so that the slope of the relation between Tobin’s q and age is more negative. Finally, if the
firm can more easily hire people who can generate growth opportunities, the expected gain to
management from paying attention to generating growth opportunities is higher, so that the relation
between age and Tobin’s q is less negative. We test these predictions in this section.

16

A. Product Market Competition
Table V reports tests of the hypothesis that the relation between age and Tobin’s q is less negative
when product market competition is more intense.
We first measure competition with the firm-specific concentration index suggested by Hoberg and
Phillips (2011). The data cover the years 1996 to 2008. During that period, we find matching
information for 33,891 firm-years. We identify firms in a competitive environment if their
concentration index is below the sample median concentration index in any given year (High
competition dummy). In regression 1 of Table V, we add High competition dummy (lagged by 1 year)
and an interaction term with ln(Age) to our standard regression. The evidence shows that the
coefficient of age is still negative and significant. Consistent with the managerial attention hypothesis,
the interaction term is positive and significant, indicating that Tobin’s q falls more slowly with age in
a more competitive environment.
The problem is that Tobin’s q is higher for firms with more monopolistic rents (Salinger (1984)).
If so, if we assume that Tobin’s q ratios eventually converge towards one, the decline in Tobin’s q
could be more moderate in competitive environments simply because competitive environments have
lower q ratios to begin with. Consistent with this argument, the coefficient of High competition dummy
is negative and significant. To address this issue, we re-estimate the regressions with standardized
Tobin’s q as the dependent variable so that Tobin’s q is adjusted for rents earned by firms in the
subsample. Standardization means that we demean the q of a given firm by the q observed for its
subsample of firms (grouped into high vs. low competition in any given year) and divide by the
subsample standard deviation of q. We include the subsample’s average q as an additional control
variable. The results, however, do not change (regression 2).
An alternative approach to control for endogeneity is to look for exogenous competitive shocks.
Guadalupe and Wulf (2010) and Frésard and Valta (2012), among others, argue that import tariff
changes constitute shocks in product market competition. Tariff reductions, in particular, should
increase competition. We can therefore use exogenous reductions in tariffs to test for whether the
relation between a firm’s Tobin’s q and its age depends on competition. We use the industry-specific
import tariff reductions identified by Frésard and Valta (2012). For the affected industries (at the SIC
17

4-digit level), we define a binary variable, Lower tariff dummy, that identifies industry-years after the
tariff reduction. We add this variable to the standard regression and interact it with firm age. The
results are shown in regression 3 of Table V. While stronger competition reduces the industry’s overall
level of growth opportunities, it slows down the age-related decay in Tobin’s q. The same results
obtain when we use standardized q ratios (grouped into pre vs. post tariff reduction cohorts in any
given calendar year) as the dependent variable (regression 4). The same result also obtains when we
use the binary measure of age, Old dummy, instead of ln(Age) in regression 4 (not tabulated).

B. Competition in the Market for Corporate Control
As discussed in Section 2, we expect the relation between Tobin’s q and age to be more negative if
competition in the market for corporate control is stronger. We test this prediction using the
introduction of business combination laws as a source of exogenous variation in external corporate
control regimes.
Business combination laws deter corporate control transactions by imposing a moratorium on
transactions, such as mergers, between a large shareholder and the firm incorporated in a particular
state as soon as the shareholder’s stake exceeds a given size. Delaware, for example, enacted these
statutes during the 1980s to deter hostile leveraged corporate takeovers. These laws take some of the
pressure off management to make an efficient use of their assets to avoid a takeover (Bertrand and
Mullainathan (2003)). Under these laws, we would therefore expect management to be able to dedicate
more time to generate growth opportunities, which would imply a less significant decline in Tobin’s q
over time.
Table VI shows that older firms incorporated in states that passed business combination statutes
during the sample period experience the predicted less rapid decline in Tobin’s q ratios over time.
Specifically, in column 1, we estimate our standard regression specification with the addition of BC, a
binary variable equal to 1 if the firm is incorporated in a state that passed a business combination
statute in a particular year, and equal to 0 otherwise. We also include an interaction term that combines
listing age and BC. The numbers show that the coefficient of company age, ln(Age), remains negative
and significant. Moreover, the existence of a business combination law per se contributes to a lower
18

Tobin’s q. However, the interaction of age and business combination statutes appears to slow down the
decline of Tobin’s q over time. Hence, as predicted, business combination laws seem to protect firms
and give their managers more time to tend to growth opportunities. We obtain similar results when
measuring firm age with the binary variable Old dummy (column 2). Since Delaware is the state of
incorporation of choice, it is possible that the results reflect a Delaware-specific effect. Columns 3 and
4 therefore replicate the estimation while omitting firms incorporated in Delaware. The results,
however, remain the same. Business combination laws delay the decay in Tobin’s q.

C. Labor Market Competition
Cross-sectional variation in the competitive structure of labor markets should have an effect on the
relation between company age and growth opportunities as well. Non-compete clauses (NCC) in
employment contracts limit the ability of employees to pursue own ventures or join firms in activities
related to those of their employers. These clauses are not enforced uniformly across states in the U.S.
Vigorous enforcement will help young firms because they prevent employees from leaving their
employer to cash in on their knowledge and ideas. In contrast, they make it difficult for older firms to
find creative employees. Hence, companies located in states that allow and enforce non-compete
clauses in employment agreements should experience a quicker decline in Tobin’s q ratios over time.
We test this prediction in Table VII. The proxy for the enforcement of noncompetition agreements
is the noncompetition enforcement index from Garmaise (2011), which is based on data provided by
Malsberger (2004). The index aggregates the answers to 12 questions about the enforcement of
specific dimensions of noncompetition law in the state where the firm is headquartered. A high index
value measures stricter enforcement. Regression 1 adds the non-competition index to our standard
specification. Age maintains a negative and significant coefficient whereas the index is unrelated to
Tobin’s q. In regression 2, we add an interaction term between the index and the binary measure of
firm age. The interaction term has the predicted negative coefficient. Consequently, firms
headquartered in states where NCCs are enforced more rigorously appear to run out of growth
opportunities more quickly. The results are qualitatively the same when we use ln(Age) instead of the

19

binary age measure. In what follows, for reading convenience and to preserve space, we only report
interaction terms with the binary age measure.

V. Managerial Attention and Strategic Focus in Older Firms
With our theory of managerial attention, as a firm gets older, it loses the ability to regenerate itself
through the development of new growth opportunities. Management cannot expect that the firm will
perform better because of exercising growth options. As a result, it has to focus more and more on the
activities where it has its greatest comparative advantage. Therefore, we expect older firms to become
more focused, to have less uncertainty, and to be more efficient in managing assets in place. Having
paid less attention to the generation of growth opportunities early on, older firms should also
increasingly lose the skills to generate such opportunities. Barring agency problems, older companies
should therefore reduce their investment outlays, especially for R&D. We test these predictions in this
section.

A. Increased Focus
Panel A of Table VIII reports coefficients from conditional logit regressions of the likelihood of
asset sales against our usual control variables and firm age. In regression 1, the binary dependent
variable identifies firms that engage in an asset sale (Asset sale dummy). In this regression, the
coefficient of the binary measure of listing age, Old dummy, is positive and significant. As predicted,
older firms are more likely to dispose of assets.
Regression 2 identifies firms that sell core assets (Core asset sale dummy). A sale is core if the
target and the acquiring company have the same 3-digit SIC codes. In contrast to that, regression 3
focuses on sales of non-core assets (Non-core asset sale dummy), which occur when the target and the
acquiring company have different 3-digit SIC codes. According to the results, the probability that
older firms dispose of non-core assets is significantly higher than that of unwinding core assets.
Hence, strategic focus does increase over time. Finally, regression 4 replicates regression 3 conditional
on the subsample of firms that actually engage in asset sales. The results confirm that older firms are
more likely to dispose of non-core assets.
20

Though a common view of diversification is that firms diversify to replace exhausted growth
opportunities, Arikan and Stulz (2012) show that more mature firms are not more likely to make
diversifying acquisitions than younger firms. If firms do not diversify more but sell more unrelated
activities as they mature, we should find that the number of reported industrial segments fall as firms
become older. We therefore estimate conditional logit regressions of the likelihood of a reduction in
the number of reported segments with the same regression specification as that used in Panel A.
According to the results, older firms are indeed significantly more likely to reduce the number of
reported segments. An important caveat with this result is that firms can assign business units to
segments strategically and that, during our sample period, there were changes in the rules that firms
have to follow in assigning business units to segments.

B. Decline in Uncertainty
Table IX investigates the relation between firm age and investor uncertainty with OLS
regressions with industry-year fixed-effects and firm-clustered standard errors. Investor uncertainty is
approximated with asset volatility, namely a weighted average of equity and debt volatility (see
Bharath and Shumway (2008)). The estimation shows that investor uncertainty does decline over time
(see also Pastor and Veronesi (2003)), regardless of how we measure listing age. This finding is
consistent with the hypothesis that firms focus and thereby reduce the perceived complexity of what
they do.

C. Increased Technical Efficiency
We argue that firms focus to exploit their earnings potential, to make their products and services
more attractive, and to lower costs. Table X tests whether the focusing effort pays off and allows older
firms to become technically more efficient. We examine three different measures of technical
efficiency, namely a sales/book-value-of-assets ratio, a sales/assets-in-place ratio, and the ratio of cost
of goods sold (COGS) per number of employees. The analysis takes the usual form of OLS
regressions with industry-year fixed effects and firm-clustered standard errors. The evidence is in line
with the predicted increase in technical efficiency in older firms. Keeping everything else the same,
21

older firms generate significantly more sales per dollar of assets invested, regardless of whether we
use a book measure of those assets or Richardson’s (2006) measure of assets in place. Companies also
achieve significantly lower COGS per employee over time.

D. Age and Current Profitability
We would expect older firms to also experience better profitability, at least initially, as they
improve their technical efficiency. Eventually, as a result of competition and the inability to innovate,
profitability should decline. To investigate this prediction, we estimate nonparametric regressions
similar to those shown for Tobin’s q in Figure 1. The results in Figure 3 reveal that ROA indeed
increases initially until about year 12 after the IPO. Thereafter it falls relative to the industry average.
In untabulated regressions, we find that the eventual decline in ROA is not compensated by bigger
volume. Older firms grow more slowly and their market share actually shrinks over time. We also find
that the sales growth of older firms is more likely to be negative than in other firms.
The question is whether the profitability decline continues and ultimately turns into a financial
loss, or whether it simply reflects the “strong presumption in economics that profitability is mean
reverting” to the industry-wide level (see Rajan, Servaes, and Zingales (2000)). Consistent with the
latter prediction, we find that the probability that a firm will have a year with negative ROA falls with
age (not tabulated).

E. Age and Investment Policy
We argued that, as firms aim at being the best in their current operations, they have less time to
dedicate to developing activities outside their core business and their ability to innovate will fall. If so,
they will be less likely to innovate. Hence, barring agency problems, we expect older firms to invest
less to generate new growth opportunities. Their capital expenditures should be comparatively lower
and they should engage less actively in R&D activities.
Table XI investigates different measures of investment outlays and tests whether they grow with
company age. We consider capital expenditures and R&D expenditures. These investment measures
are standardized with sales and regressed on listing age and the usual set of control variables using
22

OLS with industry-year fixed-effects and firm-clustered standard errors. The coefficients on our age
measure are all negative and significant regardless of whether we measure age with the natural
logarithm of age or with the binary variable that identifies older firms.

VI. Alternative Hypotheses
As predicted by our managerial attention hypothesis, we find a negative relation between company
age and growth opportunities. The relation is highly significant and quite robust with respect to
different estimation techniques, regression specifications, and the way we measure firm age. In this
section, we investigate three competing explanations of the negative relation between age and Tobin’s.
According to these explanations examined in turn, the negative age relation between age and Tobin’s q
could be the result of the relaxation of financial constraints over time, of increased managerial agency
problems in older firms, and of firm management age.

A. Aging and Financial Constraints
Over time, investors learn more about firms and their business models and not surprisingly
investor uncertainty declines. This loosens the financial constraints of firms over time and improves
their access to capital markets. Consistent with these predictions, Hadlock and Pierce (2010) find that
company age is a particularly useful predictor of financial constraints. Neoclassical theory predicts
that firms with limited capital and a given set of investment opportunities undertake the most
profitable investments first (Cooley and Quadrini (2001)). If so, it is not surprising to observe that
older firms have lower Tobin’s q ratios—although the puzzling observation of their inability to
regenerate their investment opportunity set remains. Table XII tests whether financial constraints are
indeed responsible for at least part of the aging effect we uncover.
To investigate, we use the payouts to shareholders as a proxy for financial constraints. We then
test whether firms that are financially constrained experience a stronger decline of Tobin’s q over
time—firms that are financially unconstrained are able to fund the investment opportunities they want,
hence, in their case, their average Tobin’s q will be lower and less negatively declining (the

23

assumption is that q ratios converge monotonically to 1). Whereas Panel A focuses on dividend
payouts, Panel B looks at total cash payouts (dividends plus share repurchases).
In regression 1 of Panel A of Table XII, we expand the standard regression specification with a
binary variable that distinguishes dividend payers from non-payers in any given year (Dividend
dummy). In addition, we interact this variable with the binary measure of age (Old dummy). In this
specification, firm age has, as before, a negative and significant coefficient. Neither the coefficient of
Dividend dummy nor that of the interaction term is statistically significant at conventional levels of
significance. Hence, there is no evidence that financial constraints are responsible for the age effect we
find. We reach the same conclusion when we re-estimate the regression 1 but look back at listing age 5
(Dividend 5 dummy) to distinguish between dividend payers and non-payers (regression 2). Under this
specification, Dividend 5 dummy is negative and significant, indicating that financially unconstrained
firms do indeed have lower qs. However, the variable Old dummy maintains a negative and significant
coefficient and the interaction term remains statistically zero.
To examine this latter result more closely, we split the sample by whether firms paid dividends at
listing age 5 and estimate our regression equation for the two subsamples separately. This allows for
different regression coefficients for all arguments. There is no difference, however, in the age
coefficients in the two subsamples. We therefore conclude that financial constraints cannot be
responsible for the decline in Tobin’s q ratios over time.
Our conclusions do not change in Panel B, which repeats the analysis of Panel A, except for
including share buybacks in the cash payouts to shareholders, as defined in Skinner (2008). The age
coefficient remains negative and significant across all regression specifications. Moreover, the
interaction term between financial constraints and company age has never a statistically significant
coefficient. Note that financial constraints per se are related with Tobin’s q only when we look at the
contemporaneous payouts (as opposed to those at age 5).

B. Agency Problems in Older Firms
The decrease in Tobin’s q with firm age could reflect agency problems between managers and
firm owners that intensify as time goes by. Managers could have a preference for a quiet life and
24

therefore decide to work less, steer away from risky investment and R&D projects, and simply milk
the available lines of business. This quiet life hypothesis (Hicks (1935); Bertrand and Mullainathan
(2003); Giroud and Mueller (2010)) could explain some of the observations we make, such as the
decline in Tobin’s q, the decline in asset volatility, the reduction in investment and R&D activities,
and the impact of competition. Yet it cannot explain why technical efficiency increases over time. A
quiet life, however, is only one possible manifestation of managerial conflicts of interest. We therefore
test whether older firms are more likely to have principal-agent problems, and whether that explains
the impact of company age on Tobin’s q. Moreover, since older firms invest less, we want to see
whether we find any evidence of cash redistribution or dissipation. We investigate whether the
compensation of CEOs at older firms is higher and whether older firms return cash to shareholders.
We also ask whether they end up accumulating larger cash balances.

B.1. Age, Corporate Governance, and Tobin’s q
Table XIII examines whether older firms are more prone to experience managerial agency
problems. In Panel A, we therefore sort firms into old and young, and compare the values of various
governance indices that have been suggested in the literature, namely the GIM index developed by
Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003), the delay index (Delay index) suggested by Kadyrzhanova and
Rhodes-Kropf (2011), and the alternative takeover protection index (AT index) proposed by Cremers
and Nair (2005). We also compare Board size and Executive ownership. According to this univariate
analysis, older firms rank significantly higher on the indices of managerial entrenchment. They also
have significantly larger boards and lower managerial stockholdings. Older firms could therefore be
affected by more serious agency problems.
In Panel B, we test whether these apparent problems could be responsible for the fewer growth
opportunities generated by older firms. We therefore extend the standard regression of Tobin’s q with
the proxies for management entrenchment. If the negative age coefficient is the consequence of agency
problems, it should lose its statistical significance in this regression specification. The entrenchment
variables are available only for relatively large and mature firms, as evidenced by the fact that the
median listing age in this group of firms is 21, as opposed to 13 in the full sample. The binary measure
25

of company age is therefore redefined to denote firms older than 21 years of listing age. Moreover,
since the sample of firms with the necessary data yields only 3,631 firm-years in 1,072 possible
industry-year combinations, we drop industry-year fixed-effects from the regression specification and
replace them with separate industry (138) and year (12) fixed-effects. For simplicity, we do not report
the coefficients of the standard control variables and focus only on age and governance. Under the new
specification, the age coefficient remains negative and significant, regardless of whether age is
measured with the natural logarithm of the number of years since listing or with the new binary
variable. This finding rejects the hypothesis that conflicts of interest are responsible for the decline of
Tobin’s q ratios over time.
Panel C provides an alternative test of the corporate governance hypothesis. Instead of including
all the governance indices in the regression specification, we include them one at a time. We also
include interaction terms of governance and company age. Even under this specification, however, the
coefficient of company age remains generally negative and significant. The exception is in the case of
the GIM index, in which neither company age nor governance index have significant coefficients.
Note that no interaction term has a significant coefficient in any of the regressions. There is,
consequently, no evidence that agency problems are responsible for the comparatively low growth
opportunities in older firms.

B.2. Age and CEO Compensation, Cash Payouts, and Cash Holdings
We also find little evidence of greater wealth redistribution and wealth dissipation as firms age.
Specifically, we use the model of Core, Guay, and Larcker (2008) to see whether CEO pay is higher in
older firms (Panel A of Table XIV). The dependent variable in these regressions is the log of the
CEO’s total compensation (ln(CEO total pay)). Regression 1 replicates the model of Core, Guay, and
Larcker (2008). Regressions 2 and 3 add firm age as an additional control. Contrary to the prediction
of wealth redistribution, however, CEO pay does not increase with the firm’s age. In fact, the opposite
is true. CEOs make less money in older firms, possibly because they are less productive. Hence, if
there are more serious agency problems in older firms, they manifest themselves in ways other than
higher CEO pay. The fact that the CEOs of old firms make less money suggests that the negative age
26

effect on q could be driven by CEO talent. Yet, when we control for CEO compensation (the implied
proxy for talent), the relation between age and q is still negative and significant.
Since older firms seem to be unable to generate new growth opportunities, we want to know what
they do with their excess cash. Poor governance would imply cash retention. We therefore test the null
hypothesis of whether older firms are less likely to be dividend payers. The test is implemented as a
conditional logit regression with industry-year fixed effects and robust standard errors. The results
reject the null (not tabulated). In a second step, we use OLS regressions with industry-year fixed
effects and firm-clustered standard errors to test whether older firms have lower payout ratios. The
evidence in the first two columns of Panel B rejects that prediction as well. Older firms have actually
higher payout ratios. Since dividends are not the only form of payout to shareholders, we also test
whether older firms have comparatively lower total payout ratios, where total payouts are dividends
plus share repurchases. The evidence rejects this prediction, too (columns 3 and 4 of the table). Older
firms make higher payouts to shareholders. Finally, we inquire into whether older firms hold higher
cash balances, yet the evidence shows that the opposite is true (columns 5 and 6 of the table).
Overall, older firms do not give their CEOs a higher pay. If anything, they grant them a lower
compensation. At the same time, they return cash to their shareholders and hold lower cash balances.
There is therefore no evidence of wealth redistribution in the form of higher CEO compensation or of
wealth dissipation.

C. Company Age versus Management Age in Older Firms
Company age could be a proxy for management age or tenure. Consistent with that possibility,
Table XV shows that both CEO age and tenure are significantly higher in older firms. Directors are
older and have longer tenure, too. The differences, however, are not very large. The directors of old
firms, for example, are 64.5 years of age on average; in young firms, they are 61. The corresponding
tenure numbers are 10.5 versus 8.3. A multivariate analysis in which we estimate our standard panel
regression with CEO age as the dependent variable confirms that CEO age is positively correlated with
company age even conditionally (not tabulated). However, management age or tenure cannot explain

27

the negative relation between company age and Tobin’s q. A look back at Panel B of Table XIII shows
that adding CEO and director age and tenure does not erase that negative relation.

VII.

Conclusions

This paper develops and tests a managerial attention theory which predicts that Tobin’s q falls
with age and that factors that increase (decrease) management’s attention to assets in place as opposed
to generating growth options accelerate (slow down) the fall of Tobin’s q with age. We predict that
increased competition in the goods market forces management to devote more attention to generating
growth options because the assets in place become less valuable. Using exogenous changes in
competition brought about by tariff reductions, we find that increases in competition do reduce the
negativity of the relation between Tobin’s q and firm age. In contrast, increased competition in the
market for corporate control leads management to pay more attention to assets in place. As predicted,
exogenous changes that decrease competition in the market for corporate control make the relation
between Tobin’s q and age flatter. Finally, greater competition in the labor market makes it easier for
firms to hire individuals who can help with generating growth opportunities. As a result, management
devotes more attention to generating growth opportunities and the relation between Tobin’s q and age
is flatter. This paper contributes to our understanding of how firms age, how they invest, how they are
valued, and how they are affected by agency problems.
It follows from the managerial attention theory that firms increasingly focus on their core activities
over time and in the process invest less, are less active in R&D, and are more likely to divest assets.
We find strong evidence supporting these predictions as well. Even though older firms might have
more significant agency problems between shareholders and managers (they have larger boards and
lower executive stock ownership), older firms return cash to shareholders and do not grant their CEOs
compensation that is larger than usual. Moreover, there is no evidence that agency costs are
responsible for the decay in growth opportunities over time. Finally, we find that our findings are not
due to older firms having managers with longer tenure.

value of: (a) the first year the firm appears on the CRSP tapes; (b) the first year the
firm appears on the COMPUSTAT tapes; and (c) the first year for which we find a
link between the CRSP and the COMPUSTAT tapes;
We also compute age as the number of years (plus one) since incorporation. This
information is from Jay Ritter’s Website as well as from Mergent Webreports;
The firm’s incorporation age (Ageinc) at the time of listing;
Binary variable equal to 1 if the firm in question is older (in terms of listing age)
than the sample median in any given year, and equal to 0 otherwise;
Panel B: Profitability, productivity, and growth opportunities
The firm’s COGS (cogs) divided by the number of employees (emp);
Return on assets is the ratio of the firm’s operating income before depreciation
(oibdp) divided by the lagged book value of total assets (at). The data are from
COMPUSTAT;
The firm’s sales (sale) divided by the book value of assets at the beginning of the
year (at);
The firm’s sales (sale) divided by the value of the assets in place. VAIP is the value
of the assets in place, as defined in Richardson (2006):
VAIP = (1-ar)BV+a(1+r)X-ard,
Where BV is the book value of common equity (ceq), X is earnings (oiadp), d is
dividends (dvc), r is the discount rate (12%), and a is w/(1+r-w). w is a fixed
persistence parameter with a value of 0.62, as reported in Scharfstein and Stein
(2000).
Tobin’s q, computed as the market value of the firm’s assets (Size) divided by their
book value (at). The data are from COMPUSTAT;
Panel C: Other firm-specific variables
Binary variable that identifies firms that engage in an asset sale. The data is from
SDC platinum;
Asset volatility is the weighted average of equity volatility and debt volatility. Debt
volatility is assumed be 5% + 0.25*Volatility. The weights are the ratio of book
equity and book debt in the firm’s capital structure (defined as sum of book value of
debt and equity). See Bharath and Shumway (2008);
The standard deviation of the 2-year EPS analyst forecasts, divided by the book
value of equity (per share);
Binary variable equal to 1 if the firm is incorporated in a state that has passed a
business combination law.
The ratio of capital expenses (capx) net of depreciation and amortization charges
(dp) to sales (sale). The data are from COMPUSTAT;
The firm’s cash balance (che) divided by the book value of assets;
Binary variable that identifies sales of core assets. Such a sale is assumed if the
target and the acquiring company have the same 3-digit SIC codes;
Binary variable that identifies firms that pay dividends;
Binary variable that identifies firms that paid dividends at age 5;
The Herfindahl index, HE, captures the degree of specialization based on the sales
in the firm’s different segments, as reported on the COMPUSTAT Segment tapes:

H E = ∑ i =1 pi2
N

,
where N is the number of segments, the subscript i identifies the segments, and pi is
the fraction of the firm’s total sales in the segment in question;
High competition dummy Binary variable that identifies firms in industries with low concentration (Salesweighted HH-index) < median industry concentration in any given year;

Figure 1
Firm Age and Tobin’s q
The figure shows the relation between Tobin’s q ratios and company age implied by nonparametric regressions.
The solid lines in the figures are obtained from local polynomial regressions of Tobin’s q ratios on firm age
using an Epanechnikov kernel function with a “rule-of-thumb” bandwidth estimator and local-mean smoothing.
The shaded area shows the 90% confidence interval. Figures (a) and (b) show the unconditional relation and
measure age since listing and incorporation, respectively. To obtain Figures (c) and (d), we first estimate an OLS
regression with industry-year fixed-effects of Tobin’s q on Capex, R&D, Focus, KZ-index, Leverage, Size,
Volatility, and ROA. We then regress these residuals on listing and incorporation age, respectively. Listing age
is restricted to between 1 and 30 years, incorporation age is restricted between 2 and 70 years. The sample period
is 1978 – 2009.

Probability of Regenerating Growth Opportunities in Early Years
The following figure shows the fraction of firms with q > q*, sorted by age cohort. q* is the maximum ratio
observed during the years 1 to 4 after listing. To adjust for common effects, the q ratios we use are the residuals
from a pooled OLS regression of q on industry and year fixed-effects. The sample period is 1978 – 2009.

Firm Age and Tobin’s q
The table investigates the relation between company age and Tobin’s q. Panel A estimates OLS panel
regressions with industry-year fixed-effects and firm-clustered standard errors. Regressions 1 and 2 relate to the
full sample of firms. Regressions 3, 4, and 5 exclude firms with listing age younger than 5. Variable definitions
are in the Appendix. The symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with
confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively. Panel B uses the estimates of the regressions 1 and 3 to compute
the impact of company age on Tobin’s q. The sample period is 1978 – 2009.

Table III
Age and Tobin’s q: Industry-Specific Regressions
We estimate separate regressions for each of the 48 industries identified by Fama and French (2001). We
exclude industries, such as agriculture, with an insufficient number of observations. The regression specification
is the same as that in column (3) of Table II, except we only have year-fixed effects. Standard errors are
clustered at the firm level. The column labeled “marginal impact” computes the change in q if listing age goes
from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the pooled age distribution in the industry. The impact is measured
relative to the average q in the industry, and is shown only for statistically significant age coefficients. The
symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90,
respectively. The sample period is 1978 – 2009.

Table IV
Firms’ Ability to Return to the Initial Success
This table investigates whether mature firms are able to replicate their initial growth opportunities. For the 8,079
firms with sufficient data in our dataset, Panel A reports descriptive statistics for the maximum value of Tobin’s
q before and after listing age 5, respectively. Panel B asks whether the firms’ probability of exceeding the
maximum initial q measured during the first 4 years of listing age is a function of age. The dependent variable is
a binary variable that identifies firms that switch from below the maximum initial q to above the maximum
initial q. The subsample of firms we analyze are those with a Tobin’s q below the maximum initial q. We
estimate conditional logit regressions with industry-year fixed-effects and robust standard errors. All control
variables are lagged by one year. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The symbols ***, **, and * indicate
statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively. The sample period is
1978 – 2009.

Table V
Firm Aging and Product Market Competition
The table investigates how the relation between company age and Tobin’s q is affected by industry competition.
We use concentration data from Hoberg and Phillips (2011) and, alternatively, industry-specific reductions in
import tariffs from Frésard and Valta (2012). High competition dummy means concentration below the sample
median concentration in any given year. Lower tariff dummy identifies industry-years after a reduction in import
tariffs. Industries with no significant changes in import tariffs are omitted from regressions 3 and 4. The sample
excludes firms younger than 5 in terms of listing age. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The symbols ***,
**, and * indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively.
The sample period is 1986 – 2008 in regressions 1 and 2 and 1978 – 2009 in regressions 3 and 4.

Table VII
Firm Aging and Labor Market Competition
The table investigates the impact of state employment laws on the relation between company age and Tobin’s q.
The proxy for the enforcement of noncompetition agreements at the state level is the noncompetition
enforcement index from Garmaise (2011), which is based on the data provided by Malsberger (2004). The index
aggregates the answers to 12 questions about the enforcement of specific dimensions of noncompetition law in
the state where the firm is headquartered. The data start in 1992. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The
symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90,
respectively. The sample period is 1992 – 2009.

Table VIII
Firm Age and the Focus on the Core
The table investigates whether firms are more likely to focus on core activities as they get older. It reports
coefficients are from conditional logit regressions with industry-year fixed-effects and clustered standard errors.
Panel A looks at the likelihood of asset sales. Asset sale data are from SDC Platinum. In regression 1, the
dependent variable is a binary variable that identifies firms that engage in an asset sale (Asset sale dummy).
Regression 2 identifies firms that sell core assets (Core asset sale dummy). Such a sale is assumed if the target
and the acquiring company have the same 3-digit SIC codes. Regression 3 focuses on sales of non-core assets
(Non-core asset sale dummy). Such a sale is assumed if the target and the acquiring company have different 3digit SIC codes. Finally, regression 4 replicates regression 3 for the subsample of firms that actually engage in
asset sales (Asset sale dummy = 1). Panel B investigates whether old firms are more likely to reduce the number
of reported segments on Compustat. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The symbols ***, **, and *
indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively. The sample
period is 1978 – 2009.

Table IX
Firm Age and Uncertainty about Business Models
The table asks whether investors’ uncertainty declines as firms get older. We study the relation between firm age
and asset volatility with OLS regressions with industry-year fixed-effects and firm-clustered standard errors.
Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance in twosided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively. The sample period is 1978 – 2009.

Table X
Firm Age and Technical Efficiency
The table studies the relation between firm age and technical efficiency. We estimate OLS regressions with
industry-year fixed effects and firm-clustered standard errors. In regression 1, the dependent variable is
Sales/Asset. Regression 2 standardizes sales with the value of the assets in place (VAIP) instead of book assets.
Following Richardson (2006), VAIP is: VAIP = (1-ar)BV+a(1+r)X-ard. BV is the book value of common equity
(ceq), X is earnings (oiadp), d is dividends (dvc), r is the discount rate (12%), and a is w/(1+r-w). w is a fixed
persistence parameter with a value of 0.62, as reported in Scharfstein and Stein (2000). Finally, regression 3
looks at the firm’s COGS per employee (COGS/Employee). Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The
symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90,
respectively. The sample period is 1978 – 2009.

Table XII
Firm Age and Credit Constraints
The table asks whether the negative relation between firm age and Tobin’s q is the result of looser credit
constraints in older firms. We test whether the age effect is different for dividend payers and non-payers. Panel
A looks at actual dividend payments, Panel B studies total payouts (dividends plus share repurchases). In each
panel, the first row shows the coefficients from our standard regression when we add a binary variable for
contemporaneous payouts. In the second regression, we measure financial constraints at the time firms enter our
sample. Therefore, the binary variable equals 1 if the firm paid dividends (repurchased shares) at age 5.
Otherwise, the variable is equal to 0. Finally, the third and fourth regressions in both panels split the sample into
payers and non-payers at age 5. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The symbols ***, **, and * indicate
statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively. The sample period is
1978 – 2009.

Table XIII
Company Age and Managerial Entrenchment
The table tests whether the existence of managerial agency problems in older firms can explain the aging effect
documented above. The proxies for management entrenchment we consider are Board size, Executive ownership,
the GIM index (Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick, 2003), the delay index (Delay index) suggested by Kadyrzhanova
and Rhodes-Kropf (2011), as well as the alternative takeover protection index (AT index) suggested by Cremers
and Nair (2005). Panel A shows mean comparison tests between old and young firms. Panel B extends the
standard regression from Table II with the proxies for management entrenchment. To preserve space, we report
only a subset of the regression coefficients. Since entrenchment index data are available mostly for large and
mature firms, the median listing age for that subsample of firms is 21 (compared to 13 in the full sample).
Therefore, the new binary age variable is defined as follows: Age >21 dummy = 1 if listing age > 21, otherwise
Age >21 dummy = 0. Moreover, since the number of firm years in that subsample is 3,631 firm-years spread
across 1,072 industry-year combinations, we use separate industry and year fixed effects, as opposed to industryyear fixed effects. Panel C performs similar regressions with the addition of interaction terms of corporate
governance indices and company age. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The symbols ***, **, and *
indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively. The sample
period is 1996 – 2009.

Table XIV
Firm Age, CEO pay, Cash Payouts, and Cash Holdings
The table asks whether old firms engage in excessive CEO compensation and whether they are more likely to
return their cash to shareholders. In Panel A, we use the Model of Core, Guay, and Larcker (2008) to see
whether CEO pay is related to firm age. We estimate OLS regressions with industry-year fixed effects and firmclustered standard errors. The dependent variable is the log of the CEO’s total compensation (ln(CEO total
pay)). Regression 1 replicates the model of Core, Guay, and Larcker (2008). Regressions 2 and 3 add the two
measures of firm age as additional controls. Panel B examines payout policies and cash holdings. In regressions
1 and 2, the dependent variable is the firm’s dividend payout ratio (Payout). Regressions 3 and 4 look at total
payout (dividends plus share repurchases). Regressions 5 and 6 study cash holdings. All regressions are OLS
with industry-year fixed effects and firm-clustered standard errors. Variable definitions are in the Appendix. The
symbols ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance in two-sided tests with confidence 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90,
respectively. The sample period is 1978 – 2009.
