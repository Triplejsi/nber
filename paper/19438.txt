Spousal Health Effects - the Role of Selection
James Banks, Elaine Kelly, and James P. Smith
NBER Working Paper No. 19438
September 2013
JEL No. I0
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we investigate the issue of partner selection in the health of individuals who are at least
fifty years old in England and the United States. We find a strong and positive association in family
background variables including education of partners and their parents. Adult health behaviors such
as smoking, drinking, and exercise are more positively associated in England compared to the United
States. Childhood health indicators are also positively associated across partners.
We also investigated pre and post partnership smoking behavior of couples. There exists strong positive
assortative mating in smoking in that smokers are much more likely to partner with smokers and non-smokers
with non-smokers. This relationship is far stronger in England compared to the United States. In the
United States, we find evidence of asymmetric partner influence in smoking in that men’s pre marriage
smoking behavior influences his female partner’s post marriage smoking behavior but there does not
appear to be a parallel influence of women’s pre-marriage smoking on their male partner’s post-marital
smoking. These relationships are much more parallel across genders in England.

Partner selection is a potentially important and under-researched aspect of levels and inequality
of health in all countries. If the healthy marry the healthy and the unhealthy the unhealthy and
health of partners matters as seems likely, then partner selection will exacerbate health
inequalities in a population. Health histories of partners may matter for at least three reasons
(Moden, 2007; Oreffice and Quitana-Domeque, 2010; Silvertoinen et al, 2003). First, individuals
may select their partners in part based on observable and unobservable aspects of their potential
partner’s prior health. Second, partner selection may depend on factors such as education and
health behaviors (smoking, drinking and exercise), which are correlated with current and future
health. Third, couples typically share a common life-style and the same household environment.
Health outcomes may therefore become more correlated over time are partners are exposed to
similar environmental risks, whether through choice or unexpected shocks.
Partner selection may matter as well for international differences in health outcomes. In
some countries, partner selection is at the discretion of parents and may be heavily influenced by
customs and only take place within narrowly defined and highly stratified groups. Even in
industrialized countries with similar levels of average incomes, heterogeneity and geographic
mobility may vary a good deal producing quite different degrees of partner selection. The case
we analyze in this paper- England and the United States- is a good example since the United
States is a more heterogeneous country (if only due to their immigration history and size) and
there is much more geographical mobility in the U.S. than in England (Banks et al, 2012).
There are two aspects of the existing scientific infrastructure that has limited research on
this question. Until recently, our major surveys have been focused on individuals, or when there
was information on couples there would be only a single household reporter for both individuals
in the partner/spousal unit. That is a major limitation especially when we need to know pre2

partnership data about both people (Smith, 2009). The partner/spouse data in our analysis were
reported by each partner about themselves. Secondly, comparable cross-national data did not
exist. These two limitations do not restrict our research here since our two data sets for England
and the United States (the English Longitudinal Survey for England (ELSA) and the Health and
Retirement Study for the U.S. (HRS)) made international data comparability an essential part of
their design. Both surveys also included in their later waves detailed childhood health and
background histories which allow us to investigate pre-partnership information on health and
other relevant traits.
This paper is divided into four sections. The next section highlights the main attributes of
the English and American data we use in this research. Section 2 summarizes our results on the
nature of the association between spouses and partners in terms of their pre- partnership health
and SES backgrounds as well as their contemporary health status and health behaviors at the
time of the two surveys. The third section examines models of marital dissolution as affected by
prior to relationship childhood health and the pre- and post- marital patterns of partnership
smoking behavior. The final section highlights our main conclusions.
1. Data
This research primarily uses data from two surveys — the English Longitudinal Survey
of Aging (ELSA) and the American Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). Both collect
longitudinal data on health, economic status, work, and well-being from a representative sample
of the English and American populations aged 50 and older. ELSA and HRS are strong in the
measurement of socioeconomic variables and health (self-reported subjective general health
status, prevalence and incidence of physical and mental disease during the post age 50 adult
3

years) and salient health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity). An
important advantage of both data sets for our research in this paper is that each spouse/partner
reports separately about their own health status and health behaviors as well as many aspects of
their pre-partnership lives including their family SES and their childhood health.
One limitation of ELSA and HRS is that data collection only begins at age 50 (and even
later for older cohorts at the time of the initial baseline interview). Fortunately, this limitation
was recognized, and both HRS and ELSA included very similar retrospectively reported
childhood health histories.1 In addition to a subjective question rating their childhood health
before age 16 on the standard five-point scale from excellent to poor, respondents in both
surveys were asked about the occurrence of a set of common childhood illnesses. If the condition
did exist, they were asked the age of first onset. The age 50 restriction is also recognized later in
the paper when we use two data sets that represent the entire age adult age distribution in the two
countries- Understanding Society in England and the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics in the
United States.
The list of childhood illnesses that were asked was very similar in the two surveys but not
identical- some diseases were asked in one survey but not the other.2 Even within these set of
childhood conditions, there are differences in wording or inclusion that must be taken into
account. The following childhood diseases have basically the same wording in both surveys—
asthma, diabetes, heart trouble, chronic ear problems, severe headaches or migraines, and
1

ELSA fielded their childhood health history between its wave 3 and wave 4 core interviews between February and
August 2007. The HRS childhood health history was initially placed into an internet survey in 2007 for those
respondents who had internet access and who agreed to be interviewed in that mode. The remainder of HRS
respondents received the same childhood health history as part of the 2008 core interview. See details about the
nature of these histories see Smith, 2009a and Banks, Oldfield, and Smith (2012).
2
For example, the following childhood conditions and diseases were asked in ELSA but not in HRS- broken bones
and fractures; appendicitis; leukemia or lymphoma; cancer or malignant tumor. The following conditions were asked
in HRS but not in ELSA- difficulty seeing even with glasses or prescription lenses; a speech impairment; stomach
problems; high blood pressure; a blow to the head, head injury or trauma severe enough to cause loss of
consciousness or memory loss for a period of time.

epilepsy or seizures. For the common childhood infectious diseases, HRS respondents were
asked about mumps, measles, and chicken pox separately while ELSA respondents were asked a
single question about all infectious disease with the question wording mentioning these three
diseases but also including polio and TB.3
Both HRS and ELSA have measures of the family background of respondents although
the measures are more similar in concept than in execution between the surveys. In the HRS, we
know the occupation of the father when the respondent was 16 years old, the education of both
mothers and fathers, whether each parent is alive and if not the age of death, and the economic
status of the family during the respondents’ childhood years.4
In ELSA, we have information on the occupation of the father when the respondent was
14 years old, the education of both parents, whether each parent is alive and if not the age of
death, and some more limited information on the economic status of respondent’s family in
childhood. Finally, in both surveys when there was only a single lifetime relationship we know
pre- and post-relationship patterns of smoking behavior of both partners.

3

The biggest difference between the two surveys involves allergies and respiratory problems. In HRS, respondents
were asked about respiratory disorders which included bronchitis, wheezing, hay fever, shortness of breath, and
sinus infections and were separately asked about any allergic conditions. ELSA respondents were asked about
allergies including hay fever and then separately about respiratory problems. Thus, hay fever shows up in a different
category in the two surveys. The other difference of possible significance concerns the category of emotional and
psychological problems which included two questions about depression and other emotional problems in HRS and
one question about emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problems in ELSA. In addition to any impact of these wording
differences, the form in which the questions were asked also differed between the two surveys. HRS respondents
were asked separate questions about each condition while ELSA respondents were shown a ‘show card’ which
contained a list of conditions and then asked to identify any that they may have had before age 16. The show card
format could lead to lower reported prevalence if respondents that had multiple conditions only identify a subset
from show cards, whilst they would have answered in the affirmative to each of the questions individually had they
been asked.
4
HRS respondents were asked the following question “Now think about your family when you were growing up,
from birth to age 16. “Would you say your family during that time was pretty well off financially, about average, or
poor?” The categories of response were pretty well off financially, about average, poor.

Selection Effects of Partners

2.1 Relationships between Spousal Attributes

Table 1 documents estimated relationships between early and later life attributes of spouses in
terms of health outcomes, health behaviors, and SES background in both England (using ELSA)
and the United States (using HRS). Health outcomes are provided separately for the childhood
years and for contemporary health outcomes at the time of the HRS and ELSA surveys. In this
research, we are using the 2006 (for the health information) and 2008 (to retrieve the childhood
health information) waves of HRS and the 2006 ELSA wave when their life history module was
administered.
Much of the literature on inter-couple correlations in health has focused on height and
weight, where studies consistently find strong positive associations (Taubs et al, 1992; Taubs et
al 1991; Oreffice and Quitana-Domeque, 2010; Silvertoinen et al, 2003). A smaller literature
focuses on health conditions, and finds positive correlations for the majority of conditions
considered (Di Castelnuovo et al, 2008; Wilson, 2002; Moden, 2007).
Table 1 lists age adjusted associations between spouses/partners in anthropometric
measurements, their health conditions and self-reported health in both adulthood and childhood,
the standard list of health behaviors (exercise, drinking, smoking, and BMI type outcomes), as
well as their SES background during childhood and parental attributes both now and in
childhood. The estimated coefficients in Table 1 are all derived from a series of regressions of
the female attribute on that of her male partner’s attribute in the same domain in a model that
also includes age quadratics in both partners’ ages. We also estimated a parallel set of models
where the male partner trait was the outcome variable and the female partner trait was the

6

regressor (still including the two age quadratics). The coefficient estimates were as expected
given the male and female differences in the range of the specific outcomes. None of the
substantive conclusions of this paper is affected by which spouse is used as the RHS trait.
Our adult health indicators consist at this point of adult self-reports of specific diseases
and general health status on the standard five point scale from excellent to poor. In keeping with
existing work on the spousal correlations in health conditions (Moden, 2007; Casetlnuovo et al,
2008), both partners age adjusted specific disease prevalences are positively associated across
spouses. These associations appear generally to be somewhat higher in the United States
compared to England. In our view, we would characterize these associations as positive but not
particularly large.
We tend to find the reverse country level relationship when we examine reports of
childhood disease in that in this case the spousal association in childhood disease appears to be
definitely higher in England. This seems particularly true for emotional issues as a child and
contagious diseases such as mumps, chicken pox, and measles, which are far more positively
associated in England compared to the United States. While we can only measure this in the
USA data, learning disabilities as children exhibit one of the stronger associations across
partners. Even the more objective height measure, often used as an indicator of childhood
nutrition, is somewhat more positively associated across partners in England.
There are much higher partner relationships between health measures that rely on
subjective reports on health than on reports of disease and these correlations now tend to be
distinctly higher in England than in the United States. For example, the association across
spouse/partners in reporting age adjusted adult health as excellent or very good is 0.32 in
England compared to 0.20 in the U.S. Similarly, being in excellent or poor health as a child has

7

an association that is twice as large in England compared to the United States. If fair or poor
childhood health is used instead, the association is three times larger in England. Since the
existence of adult disease appears on average to be slightly more positively correlated in the US
compared to England, the higher association in subjective reports of health suggests that health
reporting thresholds of spouse/partners are more similar in the more culturally homogenous
England than in the more heterogeneous America.
When we examine adult health behaviors (exercise, smoking, drinking, and indicators of
obesity), the results are strikingly uniform in that these health behaviors are strongly positively
associated across partners and much more so in England compared to the United States. Couples
in England are much more likely to both smoke, drink, and engage in vigorous exercise if not
together at least as a parallel common part of their lives. The only exception to that cross national
comparison is that BMI type of measures such as obesity and being overweight are slightly more
closely related in the United States. That may indicate that types and quantities of food are more
commonly consumed among partners in the United States. This greater similarity in health
behaviors in England is interesting in that health outcomes across partners/spouses appear
somewhat more positively correlated in the United States.
One particularly interesting relationship in the adult behaviors sub-segment of Table 1
concerns quitting smoking. When one of the partners quits smoking, the odds are more than fifty
percent larger in England compared to the United States that the other partner will also be a
smoke quitter. Part of the much higher similarity among partners in currently smoking compared
to ever smoking most likely reflects the fact that ‘ever’ includes a long period of time that the
partners were not together and their behaviors could not influence each other. We will model
these patterns of smoking behavior in the next section.

8

Turning to the family background variables on which the most research has been done
(Mare, 1991; Pencavel, 1998), the association in education of partners is slightly higher in
England compared to the United States (0.55 compared to 0.48). In the United States in HRS we
also know education of parents of both of the partners. The education of parents is even more
positively associated than that of the partners (about 0.6). In fact, the education of both partners’
mothers and both partners’ fathers are also highly positively associated (0.46 and 0.40
respectively) indicating that much more so than in health social background is highly socially
stratified.
Not surprisingly, other aspects of partners SES backgrounds appear also to be positively
associated. One difficulty in making these cross-national comparisons in the domain of family
background is that there are only a few background variables that are strictly comparably defined
in HRS and ELSA. One such variable that is reasonably comparably defined is whether the
father of the respondent had an occupational code labeled professional. In ELSA, a respondent’s
father is defined as professional if the respondent defines their main job as “manager or senior
official in someone else’s business”, “running their own business”, or “profession or technical”..
This association across partners is twice as high in England compared to the United States.
Table 1 presents measures of association of partners only adjusting for their ages. There
may be other characteristics that matter in influencing the strength of this association. For
example, spousal attributes (at least for first marriages) may be more positively associated the
older one is when one gets married. This may partially reflect a more mature judgment in
choosing a partner, an ability to obtain more information on the potential partner, or a greater
realization of the consequences of early life influences on adult life outcomes. Similarly, these
early life associations may vary with whether this is a first marriage or not since a previous

9

marriage failure may lead to choosing a different set of traits in a partner. To investigate these
conjectures, we reran these models that underlie Table 1 controlling for age at marriage of both
partners and whether this is a first marriage. Age of partner was not statistically significant so we
concentrate on the changing association of these spousal attributes with the number of lifetime
relationships
Table 2 displays changes in partner relationships by the number of relationships for the
United States while Table 3 does the same for England. Because sample sizes in HRS are higher
than in ELSA, we present a three way partnership classification in HRS (1, 2, 3+) and a two way
partnership classification in ELSA (1, 2+). These models are estimated separately by these
relationship categories and once again also include an age quadratic for both partners.
The most distinct pattern we find, and it is present in both countries, is that associations
in SES background clearly fall in multiple marriages. In the United States, even the association
of education of partners is half as large in 3 plus relationships compared to single relationships
that endure. The same is true, if to a lesser degree, in the size of this association in education of
parents and in education of mothers and fathers of partners. If not as sharp, a similar pattern is
found in England. While there is a slight decline in the association between partners in race and
much more so in Latino ethnicity with multiple partnerships in the United States, the association
remains highly positive in all marriage groups in the US sample in these age cohorts. Most of
the recent increase in intermarriage across race and ethnicity post-dated the age groups in the age
50 plus HRS sample.
In terms of adult health behaviors, we find a quite uneven pattern with more similarity in
some behaviors (smoking) but less of an association in others (drinking a lot). In the United

10

States and England, childhood health is generally more positively associated in first relationships
while the opposite is true for adult health.
3.1 Marriage Models
The theoretical impact of health on the probability marriage or cohabitation is
ambiguous. Healthier individuals will attract a higher “price” on the marriage market, but
marriage provides a form of insurance that is of greater benefit to the less healthy. Lillard and
Panis (1996) used the PSID to show that amongst men better health (on a composite measure) is
associated with greater hazard of marriage and a lower hazard of divorce. However, once they
condition on socio-economic characteristics, healthier men are less likely to marry, supporting
the insurance hypothesis. The results therefore point towards strong positive selection into
marriage on the basis of factors correlated with health (such as income and education), which
dominate the negative selection generated by the insurance motivation. Fu and Goldman (1994)
also find evidence of selection with risky behavior such as smoking and drug taking, and
physical characteristics such as obesity and short stature delaying entry into marriage.
Data limitations mean that there is far less work on the impact on marriage of childhood
health. That is principally because there are few panels that go from childhood to the latter life
years collecting prospectively health outcomes and fewer still that collect information on both
partners. These constraints are relaxed with the data we use in this study.
Tables 4 (for women) and 5 (for men) summarize results from our models estimating
effects of childhood health and background variables on a set of marriage related outcomes in the
two countries. The English models are in the A panels of these tables and the American models
are in the B panel. The marriage outcomes we investigate include whether you ever cohabited
(including marriage), experienced multiple marriages/cohabs, were ever divorced, and the age of
11

first cohabiting or marriage. Separate models are estimated for women and men in both England
and the United States.
In addition to an age quadratic and constant term (not displayed in the Tables), these
models include controls for having a major illness and a minor illness as a child, whether one’s
mother or father died before age 70, whether one’s father was in a professional job when one was
a child, and education of respondent. In England the education variable is labeled Ed normed
which is equal to the number of years of education minus the compulsory school leaving age.
Hence normed is equal to 0 if the cohort member left school at the compulsory school leaving
age, -1 if they left the year before, and 1 if they left the year after. This is to take into account the
change in the compulsory schooling age implemented in 1947. The estimated effects of the other
variables in these models are not sensitive to the inclusion of own years of schooling as a control
variable.
Among English and American men and women, illness during childhood has little effect
on whether one ever cohabited in large part since most people in our age group have had at least
one relationship.5 The only exception to this generalization is that having experienced a major
illness during childhood reduced the probability of cohabiting/marriage among American men.
In contrast, we find statistically significant effects of both major and minor illnesses
during childhood on whether one has had multiple partnerships or has even been divorced for
both English and American women (see Table 4). We also find that these childhood illnesses
reduced the age of first relationship for women in both countries. Table 5 shows that these
effects of childhood illness on our measures of relationship stability are much weaker for men

5

The fraction who had been in a relationship are .962 (American men), .991 (American women) , .968 (English
men), and .971 (English women).

12

particularly in England. The only exception is that major childhood illness increase the
probability of divorce among American men.
Why would childhood illness effects on relationship stability be there for women but not
for men? The fact that this gender difference exists in both countries suggests that the
explanation is not specific to unique aspects of the culture of each country but lies instead in
gender roles. One gender role that may well come into play is that within relationships,
especially in these age groups women are the care givers and are a force in improving the health
of their spouses. Poor health in childhood for women which eventually will be transmitted to
poorer health in adulthood may make the relationship less stable since not only might women
find it more difficult to help their partners but their male partners may not be willing to provide
help needed with the adult health problems of the woman.6
3.2 Smoking Models
In this section, we analyze patterns of smoking behavior pre and post marriage to assess
the influence of partners on smoking behavior. Table 6 summarizes basic patterns of pre and post
marriage smoking behavior as revealed in the HRS for the United States and in ELSA for
England, and shows that on almost all dimension the countries are very similar.
The birth cohorts in HRS and ELSA, and especially the men, were clearly heavy smokers
in the past who also exhibit significant quitting behavior, a part of which at least in the United
States no doubt was induced by the Surgeon’s General report. In both countries, about twothirds of men and two-fifths of women were ever smokers. Current smoking behavior is much
lower than ever smoking with about 10% of men and women still smoking in both samples.
6

Differences in the effects of individual characteristics on marriage by gender are not limited to childhood health.
Oreffice and Quitana-Domeque (2010) find strong inter-spousal correlations in height and weight, but additional
penalties from poor health characteristics vary by gender. Shorter men are more likely to marry shorter women,
heavier women with a lower level of education. The husbands of heavier women tend to be shorter, poorer, and less
educated. The marriage market does not additionally penalize short women or heavier men.

13

Most smoking behavior is initiated before marriage. Among men who ever smoked, 87%
in the United States and 96% in England started before marriage. For women ever smokers, there
is a more sizable difference with 68% starting before marriage in the United States, compared to
88% in England. This is the most sizable cross country difference in Table 6, and is also
reflected in the proportion of women who start smoking before marriage (27% in the United
States compared to 38% in England). In England, among those who started smoking before
marriage, the average time before (first) marriage was 5.0 years for women and 8.6 years for
men. A significant fraction of those who smoked before marriage continued that behavior after
the start of their marriage.
The final two rows show the smoking behavior of this sample before their marriage so
that it reflects smoking selection associated with marriage. In the United States, among male
smokers before marriage, 34% of them married a smoker while among male non-smokers before
marriage 21% married a smoker. The corresponding numbers for American women are as
follows- among female smokers at marriage 69% married a smoker while for female nonsmokers 52% married a smoker. Thus, while there is a distinct positive association at marriage
between smoking behaviors of partners it remains the case that many non-smokers also marry
smokers. This is especially true for American women which may not be surprising since so many
men smoked during that time period in the HRS birth cohorts.
The corresponding numbers for England in Table 6 show similar assortative mating in
pre-marital smoking behavior for English women, with 70% of English female smokers at the
time of their marriage also married smokers compared to only 54% for female non-smokers
marrying smokers. Assortative mating for English men is of a similar magnitude, with 45% of
male smokers marrying smokers compared to only 29% for male non-smokers.

14

Table 7 presents results of models estimating the relationship between post marriage and
current smoking behavior to smoking before marriage of both partners in the United States. In
addition to our standard age quadratics, our American models also include, controls for
education (three dummy variables for years of education-0-11 years, 12-15 years, and 16 or more
years with the middle group serving as the reference group), African-American race, and
Hispanic ethnicity. Our corresponding English models are presented in Table 8 with the only
difference being the absence of the two American ethnicity variables and the use of the education
normed variable instead of the American education dummies.
Consider the American models first. Among men, African-Americans smoke more but at
the time of the administration of our HRS sample and post marriage while there are no
statistically significant between group differences for African-American women. These
differences are much smaller for Hispanics with the only statistically significant difference
existing for Latinas who smoked somewhat less after marriage. Education differences in
smoking are well established in the United States (Goldman and Smith, 2010) and these patterns
are replicated in Table 7. Smoking is highest among the least educated and lowest among the
most educated for both genders. We find a similar negative effect of education in the English
models in Table 8.
Our main interest in the models in Table 7 concerns estimated effects of own and spousal
pre marriage smoking. In terms of ever smoking after marriage, not surprisingly, smoking before
marriage is a very strong predictor for both men and women. When we examine current
smoking, the estimated effects of pre-marriage smoking are considerably smaller illustrating
once again the significant degree to which these generations quit smoking.

15

Perhaps, the most interesting result in Table 7 is the asymmetric gender effects of premarriage partner smoking in the United States. Controlling for male partner pre marriage
smoking, female partner pre-marriage smoking has no statistically significant effect on post
marriage male smoking. In sharp contrast, the estimated effects of male partner pre-marriage
smoking remain statistically significant and non-trivial even after we control for female premarriage smoking. To put it simply, at least in the domain of smoking, men influence women
while women do not influence men on average to the same degree. By marrying a male smoker,
women’s health could be influenced in two ways- first the widely cited negative effects of
exposure to second hand smoke and in addition the enhanced probability of becoming a smoker.
The parallel results for England are presented in Table 8. The own sex pre marriage
estimates on current smoking are evidence of significant quitting behavior in England as well.
The other lagged pre marriage coefficients are similar to what they were in the United States. In
England, if both partners smoked it was apparently more difficult for both women and men to
cease their smoking after marriage. As for the US, the estimated effects of male pre-marital
smoking on female smoking are larger than the estimates for the effects of female smoking on
male smoking. However, the magnitudes are smaller, and only the association between male premarital smoking and female smoking after marriage is statistically different from zero.
Table 9 contains our models for quitting smoking behavior for residents of both
countries. We restrict the sample in these models for each gender to those whom ever smoked
and add categorical variables for your partner's smoking behavior (never smoked, still smokes,
quit smoking) with never smoked the reference group in the models. In both countries relative to
partners who never smoked, individuals are less likely to quit if their partners are currently
smoking with the magnitudes of these effects quite similar in both countries. We find a stronger

16

influence of partner behavior in England compared to the United States in that having a partner
who quits smoking is positively associated with you also quitting smoking in England for both
men and women. We find no such relationship in our American models.

3.3 Smoking models for younger cohorts
Attitudes towards smoking have changed dramatically since the ELSA and HRS cohorts started
smoking and formed partnerships. In this section, we use alternative sources of data to consider
whether our results hold for younger cohorts and the extent to which partnership sorting by
smoking behavior has changed. Data for England comes from Understanding Society, a UKwide longitudinal survey covering 40,000 households. We use data on smoking behavior from
the second wave, conducted in 2010. Information on marriage and cohabitation is available. The
American data come from the 2007 wave of the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID), the
premiere all age group income panel in the United States.
Table 10 shows patterns of smoking behavior pre and post marriage, for cohorts aged 50+
and 30-49 in both countries. The A panel of Table 10 has data for England while the B panel
contains the American results. Comparing the first two columns of Table 10.A and 10.B to the
ESLA and HRS figures in Table 6 for essentially the same age group (ages 50+) shows that
levels of previous and current smoking amongst the over 50s are somewhat higher in
Understanding Society than in ELSA. In contrast, they are generally somewhat lower in PSID
than in HRS, but the general patterns remain remarkably the same. The American result is not
surprising in that the PSID sample of 50+ is younger than the HRS sample.
The comparison between the two age defined birth cohorts in Understanding Society and
PSID gives the combined effect of differences by age and cohort. As expected, the proportion
17

who ever smoked is lower for those ages 30-49 than for those 50+, with a difference of 6.3
percentage points for men and 0.8 percentage points for women in England and even larger in
the PSID where it is a difference of 19.5 percentage points for men and 7.0 percentage points
form women, most likely reflecting the large secular decline in male smoking in the United
States. The proportions that smoke now are higher for the younger cohort, in part because the
probability of quitting rises with age.
The final two rows show the relationship between smoking and partner selection. Even
though the shares that smoked before marriage are very similar across the two cohorts, the
difference in proportion of smokers and non-smokers who married a smoker is much higher for
those aged 30-49 than for those 50+, indicating greater pre-marital smoking selection in partners
in the younger cohorts. While this is true in both countries, it is especially the case in England.
Table 11 decomposes the last two rows in Table 10 into those with compulsory education
or less and more than compulsory education in England and for those with less than a high
school degree and a college degree or more in the United States. For both birth cohort groups,
the proportions of smokers who married smokers and non-smokers who married smokers are
lower for those with more than compulsory education. This in part reflects lower overall
smoking rates among the more educated. Within cohort differences by education level show no
large changes.
For both education groups in England, smoking selection is greater for the younger
cohort, with higher proportions of smokers marrying smokers and lower proportions of nonsmokers marrying smokers. The largest cross-cohort differences are in the (increased)
proportions of male smokers that marry smokers and the (reduced) proportions of female nonsmokers that marry non-smokers. The change in the former does not differ by education level;
18

the change in the latter is much larger for more educated women. The remaining two groups,
female smokers and male non-smokers, are most likely to marry someone with the same
smoking behavior, and this increases only slightly over time. One explanation is that female
smoking has always been undesirable to men who do not smoke. Over time and cohorts, this has
strengthened slightly. The bigger change is in women’s attitudes to men who smoke.
Table 12 provides models of smoking behavior in Understanding Society and the PSID
that correspond to the models in Tables 7 and 8. The own effects in ELSA and 50+
Understanding Society cohorts are roughly similar, although own pre-marriage smoking has a
larger effect on current smoking in Understanding Society, particularly for women. The partner
effects are more consistently significant in the female smoking models.
As would be expected, the association between smoking and own pre-marriage smoking
are stronger for the younger Understanding Society cohort, as the quit rate increases over time.
However, the associations with partner’s smoking behavior are also stronger and similar across
men and women in the younger age group. For current smoking, this may be explained by
increasing quit rates as cohorts age. However, the result for smoking after marriage suggests an
increased responsiveness to partner behavior. This still largely remains not the case in the United
States for the younger cohort in that they largely remain uninfluenced by partner’s smoking. The
main exception is that when both partners smoked before marriage married women are much
more likely to be current smokers.
Table 13 provides models of quitting behavior that mirror those for the HRS and ELSA
in Table 9. As in Table 9, there is a strong negative association between quitting smoking and
having a partner that currently smokes. The association is stronger for the Understanding Society

19

over 50 cohort than in ELSA. By contrast, the association between quitting and a partner
quitting is only statistically significant for the age 30-49 sample in Understanding Society and
the 50+ sample in the PSID.

Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the issue of partner selection in the health of individuals
who are at least fifty years old in England and the United States. Such an investigation is now
possible since data sets such as ELSA and HRS interview both partners in the relationship and
also ask questions about central pre-partnership variables that include family background and
childhood health.
We find a strong and positive association in family background variables including
education of partners and their parents. Adult health behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and
exercise are more positively associated in England compared to the United States. Childhood
health indicators are also positively associated across partners. In general, these correlations are
more positive for first than for subsequent partnerships. Especially for women, poor childhood
health is associated future marital disruptions in both countries.
Because of the better availability of the necessary data, we investigated more closely the
pre and post partnership smoking behavior of couples. There exists strong positive assortative
mating in smoking in that smokers are much more likely to partner with smokers and nonsmokers with non-smokers. This relationship is far stronger in England compared to the United
States. In the United States, we find evidence of asymmetric partner influence in smoking in that
men’s pre marriage smoking behavior influences his female partner’s post marriage smoking
behavior but there does not appear to be a parallel influence of women’s pre-marriage smoking

20

on their male partner’s post-marital smoking. These relationships are much more parallel across
genders in England.
In the age cohorts in our samples, there was historically strong quitting behavior in
smoking. Once again, we find stronger evidence of spousal influence in England as being
partnered with a smoker makes who quit smoking makes it more likely for you to quite as well.
This relationship does not exist in the United States.
