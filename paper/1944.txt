International Lending and Borrowing in a Stochastic Sequence Equilibrium

ABSTRACT

This paper is a theoretical investigation of international lending and
borrowing in the context of a general equilibrium model in which national
productivities are subject to random fluctuations and rates of time

preference differ among countries. International capital flows arise from
the efforts of risk—averse households situated in different countries to

self—insure against random productivity fluctuations. We establish the
existence of a rational expectations equilibrium in 'which the world

interest rate is constant and strictly less than the rate of time

preference of the least impatient countries. The rate of time preference,
solvency restrictions on borrowing, and balanced—budget fiscal policies are
rigorously analyzed.

IN A STOCHASTIC SEQUENCE EQUILIBRIUM

1. Introduction
This paper is a

theoretical investigation of international lending and

borrowing in a stochastic sequence equilibrium, It shares with recent
research on the determinants of the current account by Sache (1982), Obst—

feld

(1982, 1983), and Dornbusch (1983) its emphasis on the intertemporal

consumption and savings choices of infinitely lived, optimizing house—
1
holds. However, in contrast to the deterministic, partial equilibrium
approach taken by the above authors, we

study

international lending and

borrowing in the context of a general equilibrium model in which national

productivities are subject to random fluctuations. Rates of time preference and levels of lump sum taxation differ among countries. Countries
have access to world bond market and face a borrowing limit which

precludes bankruptcy with probability one.2 International lending and
borrowing arise in the stochastic sequence equilibrium we study from
the efforts of risk—averse households situated in different countries to
self—insure against random productivity fluctuations by accumulating in
relatively productive periods financial claims against the rest of the

1

2

world which can be used to finance a less variable profile of consumption
relative to output when

productivity

is unexpectedly low.

The analysis is adopted from the work of Bewley (1984) and employs the
device of a continuum of countries subject to independently and identic-

ally distributed productivity shocks, A number of interesting results are
obtained. The equilibrium world interest rate is constant and strictly
less than the rate of time preference of the least impatient countries.

The equilibrium distribution of net foreign asset holdings among countries

is non—degenerate and stationary. Individual countries in general run
current account imbalances, and thus decumulate or accumulate foreign

assets, as national productivities are continually shocked. However, in
equilibrium, the fraction of countries with net foreign asset holdings

less than or equal to any particular value is constant over time. In
particular, we show that there is a constant fraction of countries which
exhaust their debt limits in each period and exhibit a zero correlation

between unanticipated, transitory productivity shocks and their current
account balances.

The stochastic steady—state properties of equilibrium consumption, the
current account, the trade balance, and net foreign asset holdings in each
country are completely characterized by stationary probability distributions which depend on the aversion to risk and rate of time preference of
the representative household, the probability distribution of productivity

shocks, and the equilibrium rate of interest. While the expected
asymptotic

current account balance is zero in each country, the expected

asymptotic trade balance, consumption, and

in

general

net

foreign asset holdings will

depend upon preferences and the probability distribution of

productivity

shocks. We obtain the intuitive results that low time

3

preference countries run expected asymptotic trade balance deficits,
service

account surpluses, and

consumption

achieve

higher expected asymptotic

relative to their high time preference counterparts. In the

special case in which all countries share the identical rate of time

preference, the expected asymptotic trade balance and net foreign asset
holdings are zero and expected asymptotic consumption equals mean output.

We also investigate the influence of lump sum taxes, collected to
finance government consumption which does not enter agents' utility

functions, on the stochastic steady—state in each country. In the special
case in which all governments levy the same lump sum tax, the results are

unsurprising: expected asymptotic private consumption in each country
falls by the amount of the tax and the

and

expected asymptotic trade balance

foreign asset holdings are unaffected relative to the no tax (and

thus,

no government consumption) case. However, if tax rates differ among

countries,

each

we establish that expected asymptotic private consumption in

country falls by the averase lump sum tax across all countries. This

implies that 'high tax' economies run expected asymptotic trade deficits
and service account surpluses relative to their 'low tax' counterparts.
Sach (1982) and Obatfeld (1983) investigate

borrowing

in the

international

lending and

context of a small open economy populated by a

representative, infinitely lived household who discounts utility at a
constant rate of time preference and who can borrow completely against a
deterministic output sequence at a

constant,

exgenous rate of interest.

In this set up, a steady—state exists 1ff the exogenous world interest

rate equals the rate of time preference. Household preferences for a flat
consumption profile induce current account deficits (surpluses) in periods

of below (above) average productivity. Furthermore, as emphasized by

4

Sachs (1982), consumption is constant and equal to permanent income in
each period and the stock of net foreign assets converges asymptotically
to its initial level so that, if output converges to its permanent income
level, the trade balance converges to the additive inverse of the interest

income on initial foreign asset holdings. Of course, if the world is
comprised of countries with different rates of time preference, there
cannot be a steady—state with international capital mobility in the

deterministic case. Lucas (1982, part 2) studies a two—country Arrow—
Debreu equilibrium model which features Markovian fluctuations in the
national outputs of imperfectly substitutable goods. Although his primary
concern is with asset pricing in the open economy, the strong implication
of the risk pooling equilibrium studied by Lucas is that current account
balances are zero in each period because countries hold identical
portfolios in every period.

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 establishes the
existence of a stationary, rational expectations equilibrium. Section 3
investigates the correlation between unanticipated productivity shocks and

the current account. Sections 4 and 5

between

establish,

respectively, the links

time preference and lump sum taxation and the stochastic steady

state behavior of consumption, the trade balance, and foreign asset

holdings. Section 6 provides some concluding remarks.

2.

The Model

2.1, Overview and Assumetions
We study a world economy with a continuum of countries indexed
i

each populated by a representative trader with an infinite

[0,1] ,

planning horizon. Each trader has access to a stochastic, kicardian
technology which transforms labor into the single, tradable consumption

good. We assume that labor is not mobile internationally and that no
utility is attached to leisure,3 Time is discrete, and at the beginning

of each period t = 0, 1, 2, ,.. ,

the labor input requirement in each

country is randomly shocked. These shocks are assumed to be independently
and identically distributed across countries and across time so that, with
a continuum of countries, there is no aggregate uncertainty.4

Normalizing

the labor endowment in each country to unity so that we may speak of output and productivity interchangeably, the output of consumption goods in
country

i

at date t may be written as

i

(1)

i

is a deterministic, constant lower bound on the productivity of labor

in each country and e is the stochastic productivity shock in i
t .

Formally,

at

is a drawing from a finite set of a non—negative

random variable from the fixed cd,f. G such that G(0) > 0 and
0(c) = 1
Countries have access to a world capital market in one—period bonds
and are allowed to borrow in amounts which can be repaid with probabLlity

one. However, in contrast to the recent work of Lucas (1982), we assume
that Arrow—Debreu contingent claims markets do not exist.

Although we do

6

not rigorously derive this restricted market structure, we argue, as have
Lucas (1980), Bewley (1980c), and Scheinkman and Weiss (1984) in related
closed—economy constructs, that it captures apparently important precautionary and self—insurance considerations which underlie the lending,

borrowing, and consumption decisions of 'liquidity constrained' house-

holds. This being said, let a denote the net holdings of foreign claims
maturing in period t purchased last period by country i ,
Pt = 1 +

r

and let

be the gross rate of return on these claims.

To establish the existence of stationary, rational expectations

sequence equilibrium, we begin by examining the partial equilibrium
consumption and accumulation behavior of a representative country
confronting a constant rate of interest, i.i.d. productivity fluctuations,
and a deterministic limit on borrowing which precludes bankruptcy with

probability one. Schechtman and Escudero (1977) prove the existence of a
stationary distribution for wealth in the special case in which borrowing
is not allowed and the rate of interest is zero, and show that the wealth

accumulation process is bounded above if the rate of interest is strictly
less than the rate of time preference and the elasticity of marginal

utility is bounded above. Clarida (1985) establishes that these latter
conditions are sufficient to insure the existence of a stationary
distribution for asset holdings in the more general case in which lending
and borrowing (in amounts which can be repaid with probability one) are

allowed at a constant rate of interest. Bewley (1984) proves that the
mean of this distribution is a continuous function of the interest rate
and that there exists at least one interest rate, strictly less than the
rate of time preference, at which the mean of this distribution is zero.

In a world with homogeneous preferences, a continuum of countries, and

7

i,i.d, shocks, the per—country supply of loans is given by the mean of the

stationary distribution for lending if loans are initially distributed

among countries according to this distribution. As Bewley shows, these
results together imply that there exists at least one stationary rational
expectations sequence equilibrium in which the rate of interest is

constant and the per—capita excess demand for goods and net supply of

loans is zero in every period. We extend in an entirely straightforward
manner Bewley's existence argument to incorporate heterogeneous rates of
time

preference

and, in Section 5, rates of lump sum

taxation

among

countries.

The following proposition, which is proved in the appendix, establishes
the existence of a unique limiting distribution for wealth which is
independent of initial wealth (and thus initial asset holdings).

Proposition 2.2 [Schechtman and Escudero (1977), Theorem 3.8, P. 161 and

Theorem 3.4, p. 59; Clarida (1985), Theorem 2.1, p. 9—13]: If r < &

The interpretation of such an equilibrium, if it exists, is as follows.
If foreign asset holdings are initially distributed among low (high) time

that r satisfies (22), then the goods and asset markets clear in every

a stationary,

rational expectations equilibrium, the stochastic steady-state behavior of
the current account, foreign asset holdings, consumption, and the trade
balance are completely characterized by non—degenerate stationary

probability distribution. We investigate some key properties of these
distributions in Sections 3, 4 and 5. However, we must first establish
the existence of a stationary rational expectations sequence equilibrium.
Bewley (1984) provides the existence argument for the special case in

which all countries share the same rate of time preference. The following
proposition is a straightforward extension of Hawley.

Proposition 2.5: There exists at least one stationary, rational expectations sequence equilibrium. In equilibrium, the rate of interest is
constant and satisfies:

(25)

Proof: From (22) and (18), the world per—country demand for assets is a

continuous function of r so long as 0 < r <

.

Since we assume that

a is strictly positive, (19) implies that the world per-country demand

for assets becomes positive as r 1 & ,

since

the per-country demand of

13

the & countries is bounded below by (1—a)(—yjr)
r & 0 ,

.

Conversely, as

the per—country demand for assets must become negative. It

follows that there exists at least one r such that the per—capita supply
of loans is identically zero if assets are initially distributed in .

X(a; r; 6; z)

the per—country

supply

z)

and in 6 countries according to

since these are stationary distributions,

of loans will be equal to zero in every period at

per-country

consumption will equal per—country

output in every period. Thus, we have proven existence of a rational
expectations, sequence equilibrium with interest rate r •

Q.E.D.

Figure 2 illustrates the above existence argument. Note that nothing
guarantees that the world per-country demand for assets is a monotonic

function of r ; we cannot rule

out

multiple equilibria.

3. Productivity Shocks and the Current Account
Consumption smoothing plays a key role in recent theoretical research
on the determinants of the current account [see in particular Sachs (1981,

1982) and Obstfeld (1983)]. This work implies that households' preferences for a smooth consumption profile relative to income lead, ceteris

paribus, to current account surpluses in relatively productive periods and

deficits in relatively unproductive periods. If such productivity fluctuations are perfectly foreseen, countries select a consumption profile

consistent with permanent income and use their access to the world bond

market to finance trade deficits when output is temporarily low. In the
present framework, productivity fluctuations are stochastic and, as we
have seen, the-equilibrium interest rate is strictly less than the rate of

14

time preference of the least impatient countries. These observations
suggest that countries may run up against their debt limits when faced

with a sequence of adverse productivity shocks. Without access to additional borrowing, such countries are forced to cut back consumption one
for one with output when the latter is unexpectedly low, and to use what-

ever output is produced, z

, to service the debt already incurred. We

now establish that in equilibrium, a constant fraction of countries do in
fact exhaust their debt limited in every period and exhibit a zero corre—
lat ion between adverse productivity shocks and the current account. This
fraction of 'liquidity constrained' economies is strictly less than one;

the remaining fraction of countries exhibits a strictly positive correlation between unanticipated productivity shocks and the current account.

Proposition 3.1: The equilibrium current account in each country is non—
negatively correlated with unanticipated, transitory productivity shocks.

A constant fraction of countries aP(; r; ) +

(1—a)F(6; r 8) < 1

individually exhaust their debt limits and exhibit a zero correlation

between the current account and productivity disturbances. The remaining
fraction of countries individually exhibit a strictly positive correlation
between the current account and productivity shocks.

In this section we invstigate the behavior of the expected asymptotic
equilibrium current account, trade

balance,

foreign asset holdings, and

in each country. We begin by deriving a central implication of

the equilibrium established in Section 2.

16

Proposition 4.1: The expected asymptotic current account balance in each
country is zero.

Proof: From Proposition 2.2, there exists a unique limiting distribution

for assets. In particular, if

Q.E.D.

In general, a country's expected asymptotic trade balance, foreign
asset holdings, and consumption will depend upon its rate of time preference, aversion to risk, and the probability distribution of productivity

shocks. The following proposition establishes the equilibrium relationships between a country's rate of time preference and its expected
asymptotic consumption, trade balance, and net foreign asset holdings.

Proposition 4.2: Each low time preference country enjoys strictly higher
expected asymptotic consumption than does its high time preference

counterpart, and

it

runs as expected asymptotic trade balance deficit

which is financed by an expected asymptotic service account surplus.

Proof: Clarida (1984), Theorem 3, PP. 17, shows that v'(w; r; 6)

As discussed in the Introduction, in the special case in which output
evolves according to a deterministic sequence a steady—state exists iff

the rate of interest equals the rate of time preference. In this case,
the limiting value of the trade balance is uniquely determined by initial
asset holdings, the cumulative current account surplus converges to zero,

and consumption is constant and equal to permanent income. Thus, our
findings enrich those obtained in existing partial equilibrium,

deterministic frameworks. The results contained in Proposition 4.3 are
intuitive and related to the findings of Buiter (1981) who analyzes
international investment flows in a two country version of Diamond's

(1965) overlapping generations model. Blanchard (1985) studies a small
open economy in which agents face a constant probability of death in each

period. In this framework, a steady state exists if the exogenous world
interest rate is less than the sum of the rate of time preference and the

probability of death. In Blanchard's model, if the rate of interest is
less than the rate of time preference, the small open economy is a net
debtor in steady state and thus runs a steady-state trade balance surplus.

5. Effect of Taxes on the Stochastic Steady State
We now investigate the effect of lump sum

taxes,

used to finance

government consumption which does not enter agents' utility functions: on
the stochastic steady state behavior of the trade balance, foreign asset

holdings, and private consumption in each country. We consider a world
comprised of a fraction

of 'low tax' economies and a fraction

(1—a9) of 'high tax' economies; rates of time preference are assumed to

be the same across all countries. In the special case in which all
governments levy the same

per

capita tax, the results are as expected:

the expected asymptotic trade balance and

foreign asset holdings are unaffected relative to the no—tax

(no

government consumption) case. However, if tax rates differ among
countries, we show that expected asymptotic equilibrium consumption in
each country falls by the averaae lump sum tax across all countries. High
tax economies are shown to run expected asymptotic trade deficits and

service

account surpluses relative to their low tax

that is, the transition equation for wealth is independent of the lump sum

.

Of

course,

households in countries with higher taxes begin, ceteris paribus, with

lower initial wealth. But the optimal consumption decision rule depends
only upon preferences, the probability distribution of productivity
shocks, and the transition equation (technology for transferring wealth

between periods), and not the initial level of wealth. Formally, we have

Proposition 5.1: At any given interest rate, the consumption decision
rule is independent of lump sum taxes.

Proof: Clarida (1985), Theorem 4.2, p. 19.

It follows immediately from Proposition 5.1 that the Markov processes
for wealth in low and high tax countries differ only in initial

conditions. This implies from Proposition 2.2 that the limiting
probability distributions for wealth in low and high tax economies are

identic&l for any given interest rate less than & ,

the common rate of

time preference. Thus

(56)

Re—arranging we obtain

Ea = (—0)/r

The interpretation of (57) is that, because low and high lump sum tax
countries accumulate so as to attain the identical expected asymptotic
level of wealth, the savings behavior of high tax economies must be such
that their expected asymptotic foreign asset holdings are large enough to
offset their lower after tax income and borrowing capacity.

23

Consider now the equilibrium in a world comprised of a fraction

low tax countries and a fraction (1 —

a9)

high tax countries. The

existence of a stationary rational expectations equilibrium can be
established using exactly the arguments of Section 2.3; the proof will

be omitted. In equilibrium, it must be the case that

where r is the equilibrium interest rate. We are now in a position to
prove the following proposition.

ProDosition 5.2:

Each

high tax economy runs

an expected

asymptotic trade

balance deficit and service account surplus relative to its low tax

counterpart. Expected asymptotic private consumption is identical across
countries and

(62)

equals

EcZ(l—u—(1—a9)9)+Ee,

that is, relative to the zero tax (and government consumption) case,
expected asymptotic consumption in each country falls by the average lump

sum tax across countries.

24

Proi:

Using the fact that the expected asymptotic current account is

zero, we have, from (60) and (61)

Bc0 =

6. Concludins Remarks
The objective of this paper has been to study international lending
and borrowing in general equilibrium framework in which countries are

subject to stochastic productivity fluctuations. The role of time pref—
erence, borrowing limits,and lump sum taxation were rigorously analyzed,

yielding results which enrich those obtained in the existing literature.
Two useful extensions of the present analysis would be the incorporation

25

of

capital accumulation and the derivation of equilibrium loan agree*ents

froni an underlying model of asymmetric information between borrowers and

lenders.

APPENDIX

This appendix demonstrates the existence of a limiting distribution

for wealth. Schechtman and Escudero (S—E) (1977) prove existence for the
case in which borrowing is not allowed, the rate of interest is zero, and

the rate of time preference is positive. These authors also demonstrate

that, so long as r < & •

the wealth accumulation process is bounded

NOTES

*1 would like to thank Truman Bewley, Willem Buiter, Russ Cooper, Roger

Foundation, and Penn for their comments on an earlier draft. Financial

1. Each of these authors also examines relationships between a relative
price and current account — in Sachs (1982) it is the relative price
of semi—tradeable goods; in Obstfeld (1983), the terms of trade;
in Dornbuscb (1983), the real exchange rate. To simplify the general
equilibrium model studied here, we abstract from relative prices so as
to focus on the determination of the equilibrium rate of interest and
the asymptotic properties of consumption, the trade balance, and asset
holdings.

2. It would certainly be preferable to derive optimal lending and
borrowing contracts from an underlying model of asymmetric
information. Although progress has been made on this front by
Townsend (1983), the difficulties in characterizing incentive—
compatible arrangements in a form susceptible to the analysis of this
paper preclude this more satisfactory approach at this time.
3. Indeed, if labor were mobile internationalli and preferences were
+ a
the maximum average
identical, each country would consume
product of labor — in each period and there would be no lending or
borrowing in equilibrium.

issues involved with the device of a continuum of traders.
5. Empirically, investment fluctuations appear to be an important
determinant of current account fluctuations (Sach (1981)). For
analytical tractability we must unfortunately abstract from investment
as do Sachs (1982), Obstfeld (1983), Dornbusch (1983), and Blanchard
(1985).

7. The existence of a stationary distribution for consumption follows
immediately from Proposition 2.2 and the result that consumption is a
strictly increasing function of wealth.
