The Term Structure of Euromarket Interest Rates:
An Empirical Investigation

ABSTRACT
This paper is an empirical investigation of the predictability and
comovement of risk premia in the term structure of Euromarket interest

rates. We show that variables which have been used as proxies for risk
premia on uncovered foreign asset positions also predict excess returns in
Euroniarket term structures, while variables which have been used as proxies
for risk premia in the term structure also predict excess returns on taking

uncovered foreign asset positions. These findings suggests that risk premia
in the Euromarket term structures and on uncovered foreign asset positions
move together. We test formally the hypothesis that risk premia on uncovered 3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits move in proportion to a single
latent variable. We are unable to reject this hypothesis. We are also

unable to reject the hypothesis that the risk premia on these three strategies and those on rolling over 1-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposits versus
holding a 3-month Eurosterlirig (EuroDN) deposit move in proportion to a

single latent variable. The single latent variable model can be interpreted
atheoretically, as a way of characterizing the extent to which predictable
asset returns "move together"; or it can be interpreted as in Hansen and
Hodrick (1983) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) as a specialization of the

ICAPM in which assets have constant betas on a single, unobservable benchmark portfolio.

THE TERN STRUCTURE OF EUROMARKET INTEREST RATES:
AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION

John Y. Campbell and Richard H. Clarida

I. Introduction
There is by now a substantial body of empirical work on the predictability of excess returns across assets of the same maturity denominated in

different currencies. Recent studies by Geweke and Feige (1979), Hansen and
Hodrick (1980, 1983), Cumby and Obstfeld (1981, 1982), Hakkio (1981a), and
Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) have rejected the "Fisher open" hypothesis
that interest rate differentials on assets of the same maturity denominated
in different currencies are offset by an expected exchange rate depreciation
and the hypothesis, equivalent given covered interest arbitrage, that

forward exchange rates are efficient predictors of future spot rates. The
source of these rejections is that information variables such as the
percentage forward premium [Hodrick and Srivastava (1983)) or lagged forward
rate forecast errors [Hansen and Hodrick (1980)] help to predict realized
excess returns on uncovered foreign asset positions.
Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) have tested
whether or not the time varying risk premia which separate the dollar prices
of 1-month forward contracts in several currencies from expected future spot

exchange rates are driven by a single latent variable. This latent variable
1

2

is interpreted in the context of the intertemporal capital asset pricing
model (ICAPM) as the expected dollar return on some benchmark portfolio in

excess of the nominally riskiess 1-month dollar rate) Hansen and Hodrick
(1983) were unable to reject the hypothesis that risk premia on 1-month yen,
mark, pound, Swiss franc, and French franc forward contracts all move in

proportion to a single latent variable. By contrast, using a somewhat
longer data series which included an additional twenty-one months of data
ending in September 1982, Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) rejected the single
latent variable model for the same five contracts.2
The expectations theory of the term structure of 'on shore' U.S.

interest rates has also been rejected in recent empirical work. Shiller,
Campbell, and Schoenholtz (1983) and Mankiw and Summers (1984) have shown
that the spread between 6- and 3-month treasury bill rates has predictive
power for excess returns in the U.S. terni structure. Campbell (1985) has
decisively rejected the hypothesis that the time varying risk premia on
2-month treasury bills, bonds, and stocks over 1-month bills all move in
proportion to a single latent variable.
This paper is an empirical investigation of the predictability and
comovement of risk premia in the term structure of Euromarket interest

rates. Our approach may be described as follows. We choose the dollar as
our numeraire currency and focus on four alternative strategies for obtain-

ing dollar payoffs three months hence. The first is to purchase a 3-month
Eurodollar deposit, a nominally riskless investment under our assumptions.

The second is to roll over 1-month Eurodollar deposits. The third is to
purchase a 3-month foreign currency Eurodeposit and to sell the proceeds

received three months hence at the then prevailing spot exchange rate. The

3

fourth is to purchase a 1-month foreign currency Eurodeposit, reinvest the
proceeds in 1-month Eurodeposits in the same currency, and to sell the
proceeds accumulated after three months at the then prevailing spot exchange

rate. The difference in

Post excess returns on the latter two strategies

is equal to the realized foreign currency return on holding a 3-month
foreign currency Eurodeposit versus rolling over three 1-month deposits

denominated in the same currency. Each of these latter three strategies
generates a risky dollar payoff three months hence. We establish that the
excess returns on these risky strategies relative to the 3-month Eurodollar
deposit rate are predictable given information such as the spreads between
3- and 1-month Eurodeposit rates and the differentials between 3-month
foreign currency Eurodeposit rates and the 3-month Eurodollar rate. The
main task of the paper is to test whether or not the time varying risk
premia on each of these risky strategies move in proportion to a single

latent variable. This hypothesis can be interpreted atheoretically, as a
way of characterizing the extent to which predictable asset returns "move
together"; or it can be interpreted as in Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and
Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) as a specialization of the ICAPM in which
assets have constant betas on a single, unobservable benchmark portfolio.
The data are restricted in this framework with as few as two asset returns
and two information variables.

The first contribution of this paper is to show that variables which
have been used as proxies for risk premia on uncovered foreign asset
positions also predict excess returns in at least two Euromarket term
structures. In addition, varia'bles which have been used as proxies for risk
premia in the term structure also predict excess returns on taking uncovered

4
foreign asset positions. These findings suggest that risk premia in the
Euromarket term structures an on uncovered foreign asset positions move

together. We first test the hypothesis that risk premia on uncovered
3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits and on rolling over 1-month versus
holding 3-month Eurodollar deposits move in proportion to a single latent

variable. We are unable to reject this hypothesis at standard levels of
significance. We next test whether or not the risk premia on these three
strategies and those on rolling over 1-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposits

versus holding a 3-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposits move in proportion

to a single latent variable. Again, we are unable to reject this hypothesis
at any reasonable level of significance.
The plan of the paper is a.s follows. Section II discusses the data
series used and the construction and interpretation of the relevant excess

return variables. This section also shows how we construct proxies for risk
premia, and summarizes the behavior of these information variables over the

sample period. Section III provides an overview of the estimation and
testing strategies employed in the analysis. Section IV investigates the
existence and nature of predictable excess returns in the Eurodollar term

structure and on uncovered 3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits. A
formal test of the proportionality of these predictable excess returns with

a single latent variable is presented. The section concludes with a similar
investigation of the predictability and coniovement of excess returns on

these three strategies and those on rolling over 1-month Eurosterling
(EuroDM) deposits versus holding a 3-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposit.
Section V provides some concluding remarks.

II. Construction and Interpretation of Variables
The data set used in this paper consists of weekly observations on DM
and sterling spot exchange rates relative to the dollar, and on 1- and

3-month Eurodollar, EuroDM, and Eurosterling deposit rates.3 From these
data, we construct excess returns on three alternative investment strategies

relative to a baseline investment in a 3-month Eurodollar deposit. Each
alternative requires a dollar investment and yields a risky dollar payoff
after three months.

The log of the 3-month gross return on the baseline investment, under-

is

taken at time t ,

log(l + R3(us)/400) where R3(us) is the

3-month Eurodollar deposit rate quoted in percentage points per year at time
t .

In

forming excess returns, we subtract log gross returns on alternative

investments from the baseline and simplify by using the approximation

log(l+x) â€” x

4
.

.

Finally

we multiply by 400 to express excess returns in

units of percentage points per year.
The first alternative investment strategy we consider is that of

rolling over 3 successive 1-month Eurodollar deposits. The log gross
return on this strategy is log[(1 + R1 t(us)/l200)(l +

â€¢(l + Rit+2(us)/1200)] .

Ri+1(us)/1200)

The approximate excess return on the baseline

over the dollar rollover strategy, in percentage points per year, is

2

A3'(us,us) â€”

R3 (u5) - (1/3) E R1+.(us)

(1)

iâ€”0

The rational expectation at time t of this excess return is called the
"rolling premium" on a 3-month Eurodollar deposit over 1-month Eurodollar

deposits [Campbell and Shiller (1984)]. According to the "pure expec-

6

tations theory" of the terni structure, the rolling premium is zero. A
slightly weaker hypothesis, which we call the "expectations theory" and test
in this paper, is that the rolling premium is constant through time at some
(possibly nonzero) level.

The next set of alternative investments involves the purchase of a

3-month EuroDM or Eurosterling deposit. For example, dollars are used to

purchase DM at time t ;

the DM are invested in a 3-month EuroDM deposit:

and the DM proceeds are converted to dollars at the time t+3 spot exchange
rate, which is uncertain at time

â€¢6 The log gross return on this

strategy is

log[(l + R3(g)/4OO)S3(g)/S(g)]

where S(g) is the dollar price of DM at time t .

The approximate excess

return on the baseline over the 3-month DM strategy, in percentage points

per year, is

3'3(us,g) â€”

R3(us)

-

R3(g)

-

400[log S3(g) - log S(gfl

(2)

The "Fisher open" hypothesis (uncovered interest parity) states that the

rational expectation of (2) at time t is zero, or at least constant
through time.

Finally, we consider mixed strategies which involve rolling over

1-month EuroDM or Eurosterling deposits. Returns on these strategies are
uncertain both because future 1-month Eurodeposit rates are uncertain, and

because future spot exchange rates are uncertain.7 The log gross return on
a mixed DM strategy is

more complex model, with multiple goods or cash-in-advance constraints,
equation (5) would have to be generalized but a relation of the form (4)
would remain valid.
In our context, (4) implies that, for example,

which is obtained by subtracting relation (4) for the DM rollover strategy
from relation (4) for the baseline Eurodollar investment strategy.
Rearranging the expectation of the product into the sum of the covariance and the product of expectations, (6) implies

E[A3'(us,g)) â€” covt[Qt+3, 43'(us,g)]/E[QÃ·3]

(7)

Thus the risk premium is proportional to the conditional covariance of the
interteniporal marginal rate of substitution of dollars and the excess dollar

return on buying DM, rolling over 1-month EuroDM deposits, and selling the
accumulated proceeds back for dollars at the exchange rate prevailing three

months hence. The other risky returns studied in this paper are priced
analogously in the ICAPM framework.

Now consider a "benchmark" portfolio defined to have nominal return

Clearly, for any asset i

(9)

SO

that

E{(l + h3(b))(l + h3(i))] â€” (1 + R3 t(u5))E(1 + h3(b))

(10)

This can be rewritten as

R3(us) -

E[h3(i)J

â€”

cov[h3(i),

This relationship must hold for h3(i) â€”

h3(b)]/E {(1 + h3b))]

h3(b)

,

(11)

so we can substitute

out E{l + h3(b)] to obtain

R3(us) -

E[h3(i))

1ER3(us) -

Eh3(b)I

(12)

or in more compact notation,

E[A3(i)) where

covt[h3(i), h(b)]/var [h3(b)] â€”

cov[A3(i),

Thus, the expected dollar excess return on asset

i is proportional to the expected excess return on a benchmark portfolio
whose payoff is perfectly conditionally correlated with the intertemporal

10

marginal rate of substitution of dollars. Although the betas

can in

general vary over time, our econometric work will test restrictions implied

by constant betas. As pointed out by Hansen and Hodrick (1983), such tests
are not tests of a fully specified general equilibriun model, but are tests
of proportional co-movement of expected excess returns which are motivated
by the ICAPM.

In Section IV, we test the hypotheses that the rational expectations of
excess returns are constant through time by regressing excess returns on a

constant and "information variables" which are known at time t ,

and

testing the joint significance of the information variable coefficients.
If such tests are to be powerful against a broad range of alternatives, the information variables used should be ones which plausibly predict
excess returns when the expectations and Fisher open hypotheses are false.
Some authors have used lagged excess returns [Hansen and Hodrick (1980)],

thereby conducting a "weak-form" test. We adopt a different approach, using
as information variables elements of excess returns themselves, as defined

in equations (1), (2) and (3), which are known at time t

The element of (1) which we use for our tests is R3(us) -

R1(us)

the spread between 3-month and 1-month Eurodollar interest rates. Using the
linear approximation for the term structure, the Eurodollar spread can be
decomposed into

R3(us) -

R1(us)

â€”

EA3"(us,us)

+ [ERi+i(us) -

+ [ERi+2(us) -

ERiÃ·i(us)]

Ri(us)]
(13)

11

When the expectations theory of the term structure holds, the first term on

the right hand side of (13) is a constant;

unusually high longer term

interest rates are then due entirely to expectations of short rate increases. However if there is any variation in the rolling premium, it will
be reflected in the spread so that this variable should be a good instrument
for our empirical work.

The element of (2) we use is

R3(us) -

the

R3

interest

differential between 3-month Eurodollar and EuroDM and Eurosterling rates.8

Following Fama (1984), we can decompose this variable into the sum of the
cross-currency risk premium, and the expected rate of depreciation of the
dollar relative to currency j

R3(us) -

R3(i) â€” EA33)(us,j)

+

4OO[E log S3(j) - log S(j)] . (14)

When uncovered interest parity holds, the first term on the right hand side
of (14) is constant, and unusually high differentials are then due entirely

to expected dollar depreciation. However in general variation in the crosscurrency risk premium will be reflected in the differential, so this is also
a good instrument for our purposes.
One final set of information variables corresponds to equation (3). We
include foreign currency term structure spreads,

R3(i) -

R1

which

can be decomposed in the manner of equation (l3).
If our tests are to be powerful, it is also desirable that our informa-

tion variables should not be too highly correlated.

The inclusion of

variables which are highly collinear with other instruments is likely to use
up degrees of freedom in estimation and testing, without contributing to the

predictability of returns. To check for this, and to review the behavior of

12

interest rates over our sample, we present summary statistics for information variables in Table 1.

The first row of Table 1 reports the mean Eurodollar spread, the mean
differentials between 3-month Eurodollar and foreign currency rates, and the

mean foreign currency spreads. Mean spreads in all currencies are positive

but small, ranging from just over 5 basis points in the UK to almost 13
basis points in Germany.

The mean Eurodollar rate is more than 420 basis

points higher than the mean EuroDM rate, but almost 175 basis points lower
than the mean Eurosterling rate. The second row of Table 1 reports standard
deviations, which are all quite large relative to the nieans)Â°

The bottom panel of Table 1 shows the correlations of the various
instruments. The highest correlation, 0.646, is between the two

differen-

tials; evidently movements in US interest rates relative to the other two
currencies account for a large part of the variation in the differentials.

There are positive but fairly small correlations among the spreads in all
three currencies. None of the correlations are high enough to suggest that
we should drop any of our information variables.

III. EcrQmetric Issues
Most of the empirical work of this paper is conducted within a standard
regression framework.

The major econometric difficulty in our application

is one which is by now familiar from the work of Hansen and Hodrick (1980)

and others; we have weekly observations but a 3-month (13-week) holding
period, so the error terms in our regressions follow an MA-12 process under
the null hypothesis.

11

13

Serial

correlation in the equation error does not affect the consis-

tency of OLS coefficient estimates, T but it does require an
adjustment in the estimated variance-covariance matrix of these estimates.

Hansen and Hodrick (1980), following Hansen (1979), propose the following
consistent estimator of the variance-covariance matrix of

The above estimator does not allow for conditional heteroskedasticity
in the error terni, but it is straightforward to do so, using the method of

White (1984) and following Hsieh (1984) and Cuniby and Obstfeld (1984), by

One problem with both Hansen and Hodrick's estimator and its heteroskedasticity-consistent variant, is that

Thus use of

Newey and West's estimator gave us standard errors which were at least as
large as any of the alternatives discussed above.'2

When we come to estimate restricted single latent variable models, we
use

the

Generalized Method of Moments procedure (Hansen (1982), Hansen and

Singleton (1982)), which allows for the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity.

This is important because in the ICAPM variations in expected

returns on the benchmark portfolio will generally be associated with
variations in the conditional covariance matrix of excess returns. We use
Hansen's Chi-square statistic to test the nonlinear cross-equation restrictions of the model. We again employ Newey and West's procedure to construct
the optimal weighting matrix for the GMM estimation.

IV. Empirical Results

Tables 2, 3, and 5 present regression results which establish the
predictability of excess returns in the Eurodollar term structure and on
uncovered investments in 3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits.

The

sample period is 1976:1 through 1982:52. The top half of Table 1 shows that

15

these

excess returns do not exhibit first-order serial correlation, thus

passing the simplest "weak form" efficient markets test.13

However, as

indicated in the bottom half of Table 2, the spread between the 3- and
1-month Eurodollar rate has significant explanatory power for realized
excess returns in the Eurodollar term structure, and the spread between the

3-month Eurodollar rate and the 3-month Eurosterling rate

(to a close

approximation, the percentage forward premium on sterling) helps predict
realized excess returns on uncovered 3-month Eurosterling deposits. Similar

findings are reported in Hakkio and Leiderman (1984) who test, and reject,
the hypothesis that expected excess returns in the Eurodollar, EuroDM, and
Eurosterling markets are constant.

More interesting are the results of Table 3. The top row demonstrates
that the spreads between the 3-month Eurodollar rate and the 3-month EuroDM

and Eurosterling rates jointly have incremental predictive content for

excess returns in the Eurodollar term structure after allowing for the
information contained in the spread between the 3- and 1-month Eurodollar
rate. The bottom row of Table 3 shows that the spread between the 3-month
and 1-month Eurodollar rate has significant explanatory power for realized

excess returns on uncovered Eurosterling deposits as do the differentials

between the 3-month Eurodollar rate and the 3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposit rates.

Tables 2 and 3 also indicate that none of the

aforementioned variables predict realized excess returns on uncovered EuroDM
deposits.

However, as shown in the second row of Table 5, the spreads

between 3- and 1-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposit rates both have
significant explanatory power for excess returns on uncovered 3-month EuroDM

deposits. To summarize, variables which have been used as proxies for risk

16

premia

on uncovered foreign asset positions also predict excess returns in

the Eurodollar term structure, while variables which have been used as
proxies for risk premia in the term structure also predict excess returns on
taking uncovered foreign asset positions.

These findings suggest that risk premia in the Eurodollar term struc-

ture and on uncovered foreign asset positions move together. We now test
formally the hypothesis that risk premia on uncovered 3-month EuroDM and
Eurosterling deposits and on rolling over 1-month versus holding 3-month
Eurodollar deposits move in proportion to a single latent variable.
As discussed in Section II, the ICAPM places the following restrictions

on the excess returnof a particular asset i

E[A3(i)Ix] â€”

fi.E[)3(b)Ix]

(16)

This equation is derived by projecting equation (12) onto a k-vector

information variables, a subset of the market's full information set. The

first element of x is just a constant.

is the "beta" of excess

return i with the benchmark portfolio, defined as in equation (12) but now

assumed to be constant through time.

Since the expected excess return on

the benchmark portfolio is unobservable, we substitute the best linear
projection of this excess return on the variables in x ,

E[A3(b)fx] â€”

and Eurosterling rates.

The restrictions of the single latent variable

model cannot be rejected at any reasonable level of significance:

a x(6)

value of at least 7.323 would occur 29.2% of the time under the null.
Close inspection of Tables 2 and 3 reveals why we obtain this result.

The key excess returns are A(31) (us,us)

and A(33) (us,uk)

which are

predictable in Table 3. The a coefficients in Table 4 are quite close to

the unconstrained regression coefficients of A3'(us,us) in the first
row of Table 3.

The constrained system must then fit A3'3(us,uk) to

this vector of coefficients, multiplied by some scalar.
fl3

The choice of

-1.193 generates a vector of coefficients for A3'3(us,uk) which

has the same sigr pattern as the unconstrained coefficients, although a

18

smaller magnitude. The system estimates the a coefficients quite precisely, but the standard errors of the fl's are large relative to their point
14
estimates.

Table 4 also reports the correlations of the estimated latent variable

with each of the instruments.

Even though the latent variable has been

arbitrarily normalized by setting fl1 â€” 1

,

the same correlations (up to a

possible sign change) would be obtained by any other normalization given the

estimated coefficients of Table 4.

The estimated latent variable is most

strongly correlated with the Eurodollar spread, at 0.697, but is also quite
highly correlated with the two differentials.

In Tables 5 to 7 we repeat the above analysis for a large system of
excess returns and information variables. The vector of excess returns is
expanded to include the foreign term structure excess returns

and ).3'(uk,uk) .

We

work with these excess returns, rather than the

excess returns on ttmixed investment strategies defined in equation (2'),
for several reasons.

First, the foreign term structure excess returns are

more directly comparable with excess returns in the domestic term structure.

Secondly, the variance of exchange rate changes, and therefore of crosscurrency excess returns, is much greater than the variance of 1-month
interest rate changes which lead to term structure excess returns. (This can
be seen in the table of summary statistics following Table 5.) When the two

types of excess return are combined in a "mixed" excess return, the cross*

currency excess return dominates;

(3,1)
)'

.

(us,j)

and

(33) (us,j)

are

almost perfectly collinear. Finally, even though the foreign term structure

excess returns are not excess returns on dollar investments relative to a
dollar benchmark, they are the differences between two dollar excess returns

19

and thus, under the null hypothesis, obey the linear restrictions implied by
the single latent variable model stated above.

Corresponding to the foreign term structure excess returns, we now
include foreign terni structure spreads in our vector of information variables along with the dollar spread and the cross-currency interest differentials.

Regression results for the larger system are presented in Table 5. The

two new information variables have considerable explanatory power for
cross-currency excess returns on 3-month Eurodeposits, so that the excess
return on the 3-month EuroDM investment strategy is now predictable

with the other excess returns.

along

The excess return in the EuroDM term

structure is highly predictable; by contrast the expectations theory of the

term structure cannot be rejected in the Eurosterling term structure.

In

general there appear to be important cross-effects which suggest that once
again a single latent variable model might fit the data well.

In Table 6 we test and are unable to reject the hypothesis that a
single latent variable explains the results of Table 5.

Once again the

coefficients are estimated precisely relative to the

coefficients,

the point estimates of the

8's

fi

but

generally imply reduced-form regression

coefficients which match the sign pattern of the most significant unconstrained coefficients. The new

coefficients for foreign term structure

spreads are estimated quite close to unity, although these estimates seem to

be somewhat sensitive to the choice of starting values for the GMM procedure.

Finally, in Table 7 we shrink the model to the first three rows of
Table 5, in order to compare the results with those of Table 4 which used

20

the same set of excess returns, and in order to check the robustness of the

latent variable model to changes in the estimated system.

Once again the

model seems to fit the data quite well; higher test Statistics would be
obtained under the null 19.5% of the time.

In both Tables 5 and 6 the

estimated latent variable continues to have a high correlation of around 0.7
with the Eurodollar spread.

VI. Conclusion
In this paper we document the existence of predictable time-varying
excess returns on a variety of investment strategies, relative to a 3-month

Eurodollar investment. The strategies we consider involve three currencies

--the dollar, the DM and the pound sterling- -and two maturities--3- and
1-month Eurodeposits.

We find not only that excess returns are predictable, but that there
are important cross-effects.

Variables which traditionally are used to

predict term structure excess returns also have explanatory power for
cross-currency excess returns, and vice versa. In fact a tightly specified
model, constraining all expected excess returns to move in proportion with a

single latent variable, cannot be rejected at any reasonable significance
level in a variety of tests. The estimated latent variable is quite highly
correlated with the spread between 3- and 1-month Eurodollar interest rates.

Our favorable results for the single latent variable model contrast
with the rejections reported by Campbell (1985) for US domestic assets and

by Hodrick and Srivastava (1984) for Eurocurrency assets. However Gibbons
and Fersori (1985) and Hansen and Hodrick (1983), wrking with domestic and

Eurocurrency data respectively, also failed to reject the model.

An

21

important

topic for future research is to sort out these apparently con-

flicting results.

It does seem to be the case that rejections occur when

more heterogeneous assets are studied, and when a longer sample period is
used.

Slow changes through time in relative betas of assets with widely

divergent characteristics might explain this pattern of results.

Our work

should not be taken to imply that betas are constant for all assets in all

sample periods, but merely as evidence that a simple latent variable
structure describes our data.

These results are preliminary to a more structural investigation of the

sources of predictable excess returns across currencies and maturities. If
indeed predictable excess returns are driven by a single underlying latent
variable, it seems plausible that conditional second moments of returns also

move with this variable. We hope to explore the interrelationship between
conditional first and second moments of returns in future work.

FOOTNOTES

1.

However, as Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1983)
are careful to point out, their approach to modelling is best construed
as an interpretation of a parsimonious statistical representation of
risk premia using intertemporal capital asset pricing theory.
In
particular, their statistical tests are not tests of a fully specified
equilibrium model.

2.

Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) also employ non-overlapping data.
However their rejection of the single latent variable model is not due
to their different sample procedure.

3.

We are grateful to Richard Levich for supplying us with these data,
derived originally from Harris Bank sources.
The data set also
includes forward exchange rates and 6 and 12 month Eurodeposit interest
rates, which we do not use here.

4.

This approximation is commonly used in empirical work on the term
structure (Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983), Mankiw and Summers
(1984)).

For the short 3-month holding period considered in this

paper, the approximation is extremely accurate since gross returns are
very close to one when measured in natural units.
5.

Campbell and Shiller also discuss the "holding premium" on a long-term
investment, sold before maturity, relative to a short-term investment.
We do not consider holding premia in this paper since Eurodeposits are
generally non-negotiable and must be held to maturity.

6.

It would also be possible to arrange at time t to convert the DM back

to dollars at a known forward exchange rate.

This would give a

riskiess 3-month dollar return which by arbitrage ("covered interest
parity") is always very close to the 3-month Eurodollar rate. Small
deviations from covered interest parity in the Euromarkets appear to
arise from transactions costs.
7.

Note that it would not be possible to fully hedge the exchange risk of
a mixed strategy by engaging in a forward exchange transaction. This
is because the number of DM which must be converted back to dollars at
time t+3 depends on future 1-month DM rates, and thus is not known at

time t.
8.

By covered interest parity, the interest differential is also the
forward premium (400 times the log of the ratio of the 3-month ahead
forward rate quoted at time t
to the time t spot rate).
,

9.

The decompositions of (17) and (18) help to account for the fact that
spreads and differentials have been used to obtain powerful rejections
of the expectations and Fisher open hypotheses, as documented in the
introduction to the paper.

30

10. All the information variables have a fairly high degree of serial
correlation, so the standard deviations should not be interpreted as if
they come from independently and identically distributed variables.

11. This statement is true for regressions with cross-currency excess returns (2) as the dependent variable. With term structure excess returns (1) or (3) as the dependent variable, uncertainty is resolved
after 2 months when the 2-month ahead 1-month Eurodollar rate becoses
known, so the error process is only MA-8. We ignore this in our empirical work, thus obtaining conservative estimates of standard errors.

12. Alternative methods for constructing a positive definite T matrix
have been developed by Hansen (1982) and Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld
However we found Newey and West's approach to be easier to
(1983).
apply.

13. However, for all three excess return, we can rejects at the 5% level
the hypothesis that the first six autocovariances are jointly zero.

14. Point estimates of some of the coefficients in Table 3 are sensitive to

the starting values used in the estimation, because these starting
values help to determine the first-round weighting matrix in the GMM
procedure. However, the Chi-squared test statistic is only minimally
affected by starting values.
