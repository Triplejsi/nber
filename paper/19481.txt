ABSTRACT
Many organizations have budgets that expire at the end of the fiscal year and may face incentives to
rush to spend resources on low quality projects at year’s end. We test these predictions using data
on procurement spending by the U.S. federal government. Spending in the last week of the year is
4.9 times higher than the rest-of-the-year weekly average, and year-end information technology projects
have substantially lower quality ratings. We also analyze the gains from allowing agencies to roll over
unused funds into the next fiscal year.

Introduction

Many organizations have budgets that expire at the end of the fiscal year. In the United States,
most budget authority provided to federal government agencies for discretionary spending requires the agencies to obligate funds by the end of the fiscal year or return the funds to the Treasury; state and municipal agencies typically face similar constraints (McPherson, 2007; Jones, 2005;
GAO, 2004).1
This “use it or lose it” feature of time-limited budget authority has the potential to result in low
value spending, since the opportunity cost to organizations of spending about-to-expire funds is
effectively zero.2 Exacerbating this problem is the incentive to build up a rainy day fund over the
front end of the budget cycle. Most organizations are de facto liquidity constrained, facing at the
very least a high cost of acquiring mid-cycle budget authority. When future spending demands
are uncertain, organizations have an incentive to hold back on marginal spending early in the
budget cycle and then burn through this buffer-stock at the end of the year.
This paper examines the quantitative importance of wasteful year-end spending in the U.S.
federal government and the efficiency gains from policies that could be used to address this issue.
We present a simple model of the annual budget process for a single government agency with expiring budget authority. At the beginning of each year, Congress chooses a budget for the agency.
In each subperiod within the year, the agency draws a parameter that determines the marginal
value of expenditure and chooses a level of spending to maximize an objective with decreasing returns. We show that the combination of uncertainty and decreasing returns can lead the agency to
engage in precautionary savings over the first part of the year. At the end of the year, the prospect
of expiring funds leads the agency to spend all of its remaining resources even if the marginal
value is below the social costs of funds (our definition of wasteful spending). As a result, there is
a spike in the volume of spending and a drop-off in quality at the end of the year.
Anecdotal evidence supports these predictions. A Department of Defense employee inter1 At

the end of the federal fiscal year, unobligated balances cease to be available for the purpose of incurring new
obligations. They sit in an expired account for 5 years in case adjustments are needed to account accurately for the cost
of obligations incurred during the fiscal year for which the funds were originally appropriated. At the end of the 5
years, the funds revert to the Treasury general fund.
2 In some settings, unspent funding may not only represent a lost opportunity but can also signal a lack of need
to budget-setters, decreasing funding in future budget cycles (Laffont and Tirole, 1986; Lee and Johnson, 1998; Jones,
2005). When current spending is explicitly used as the baseline in setting the following year’s budget, this signaling
effect is magnified.

viewed by McPherson (2007) describes “merchants and contractors camped outside contracting
offices on September 30th [the close of the fiscal year] just in case money came through to fund
their contracts.” At a 2006 congressional hearing, agency representatives admitted to a “use-it-orlose-it” mentality and a “rush to obligate” at year’s end (McPherson, 2007). In Canada, where the
fiscal year ends on March 31, the Treasury Board President has used the term “March Madness”
to describe the year-end rush-to-spend.3
Yet despite these accounts, there is no hard evidence on whether U.S. federal spending surges
at the end of the fiscal year or whether year-end spending is lower-value than spending during the
rest of the year. Reports from the Government Accountability Office in 1980 and 1985 documented
that fourth quarter spending among federal agencies was somewhat higher than spending during
the rest of the year. Yet a follow-up report, GAO (1998), was unable to examine quarterly agency
spending patterns for 1997 because agency compliance with quarterly reporting requirements was
incomplete. The report nevertheless concluded that because “substantial reforms in procurement
planning and competition requirements have changed the environment . . . year-end spending is
unlikely to present the same magnitude of problems and issues as before.”
We address this evidentiary shortfall by examining data on procurement spending by the U.S.
federal government. Federal procurement is important, accounting for about 15 percent of government expenditure, and is the category where agencies have the most discretion over the timing
of spending. Our data is a near-universe of federal procurement spending from 2004 to 2009,
which was recently made available to the public. These data contain contract-level information on
the timing of 14.6 million purchases, totaling $2.6 trillion in government expenditure.
The data show a large spike in spending at the end of the year. If procurement spending were
uniformly distributed over the year, 1.9 percent of spending would occur in each week on average.
We find that 8.7 percent of spending occurs in the last week of the year, or nearly 5 times the restof-year weekly average. The surge in spending is broad-based, occurring in nearly all of the major
government agencies. Consistent with spending on non-essential projects, year-end spending is
more pronounced for maintenance and repair of buildings, furnishings and office equipment, and
I.T. services and equipment.

We examine the effect on the quality of spending using a newly available dataset on the performance of 686 major information technology (I.T.) projects. Our dataset on large I.T. projects
accounts for $130 billion in spending. It is also a category with a large year-end spike, with 12.3
percent of spending occurring in the last week of the year. Most importantly, our dataset provides
us with a credible measure of project quality, a categorical index that combines assessments from
agency chief information officers (CIOs) with data on cost and timeliness. The index is a central
element in government-wide reviews that sometimes lead to project terminations.
These data show a sharp drop-off in quality at the end of the year. Projects that originate in
the last week of the fiscal year have 2.2 to 5.6 times higher odds of having a lower quality score.
Ordered logit and OLS regressions show that this effect is stable across a broad set of specifications.
We examine and reject a number of alternative explanations for our finding.
Having confirmed predictions consistent with our model of wasteful year-end spending, we
turn to policies that could be used to address this problem. A natural solution is to allow agencies
to roll over unused funds into the subsequent fiscal year. We extend the model to allow for rollover
and show that welfare gains crucially depend on the degree to which Congress adjusts future
budget allocations to account for rolled over funds. If Congress reduces budgets one-for-one with
rollover, agencies have no incentive to use this mechanism. If rolled over funds are non-salient or
if Congress can at least partially commit to ignoring them, then welfare gains can be realized.
Within the U.S. federal government, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has obtained special
authority to roll over unused budget authority for I.T. projects into a fund that can be used on I.T.
expenditure in the following year. We show that DOJ does not have a spike in the volume of I.T.
spending, with only 3.4 percent of I.T. spending occurring in the last week of the year compared
to 9.3 percent for non-I.T. spending. Difference-in-differences analysis that compares I.T. and nonI.T. spending at DOJ and other agencies indicates that rollover reduces the volume of year-end
spending by 9.5 percentage points, with a p-value of less than 0.1 percent. We also find that DOJ
does not have a drop-off in quality at the end of the year. While the quality results are statistically
significant at the 1 percent level, we caution that our DOJ evidence on quality is based on a small
number of contracts.
We analyze the potential welfare gains from allowing rollover by calibrating a model to fit
the spike in spending and drop-off in quality. We show that intermediate policies, such as al3

lowing agencies to roll over funds for only a short grace period, can generate welfare gains of
almost three-quarters of the full rollover value. The intuition behind this result is that even a
small amount of rollover allows agencies to avoid the lowest value spending at the end of the year
while maintaining sufficient precautionary balances to respond to emergency spending needs.
To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first economic analysis of wasteful year-end
spending, either in government or in a private organization. Our primary references are GAO
(1985, 1998, 2004) reports and a master’s thesis by McPherson (2007). Within economics, our work
is most closely related to Oyer (1998), who studies how nonlinear salesperson and executive contracts lead to increased sales at the end of private sector fiscal years.4
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a model of wasteful year-end
spending. Section 3 examines the surge in year-end spending using a comprehensive dataset on
federal procurement. Section 4 tests for a year-end drop-off in quality using data on I.T. investments. Section 5 examines the benefits of rollover. Section 6 concludes.

A Model of Wasteful Year-End Spending

In this section, we present a model of year-end spending. The model uses the simplest possible
setup—an annual budget with two six-month subperiods—to make precise what we mean by
wasteful year-end spending. In Section 3 and Section 4, we examine predictions from the model.
In Section 5, we generalize the model to an infinite horizon setting with an indefinite number of
subperiods to examine the welfare effects of alternative approaches to budgeting.

2.1

Model Setup

Consider an annual model of budgeting with Congress and a single government agency. At the
beginning of the year, Congress chooses a budget B for the agency. Divide the year into two sixmonth periods, indexed by m = 1, 2. In each period, the agency learns about the marginal value
of spending in that period and makes a spending decision accordingly.
The model has three key features. First, there are expiring budgets. Resources that are not
4 Relatively few private sector firms have fiscal years that coincide with the federal government’s, so the effects we
measure are unlikely to result from this channel.

spent by the end of the year are lost to the agency and returned to the Treasury.
Second, there is uncertainty about the value of spending in future periods. This uncertainty
could arise from either demand or supply factors. Shifts in military strategy or an influenza outbreak, for example, could generate an unanticipated change in demand for budget resources. On
the supply side, uncertainty could be driven by variation in the price or quality of desired goods
and services.5
Third, there are decreasing returns to spending within each period. Decreasing returns could
result from short-run rigidities in the production function. For example, federal agencies with a
fixed staff of contracting specialists might have less time to devote to each contract in a period
with abnormally high spending. Alternatively, decreasing returns could result from a prioritybased budgeting rule. During a given period, organizations might allocate resources to projects
according to the surplus they provide. We first describe the agency problem and then examine the
problem faced by Congress.
Agency problem. To model uncertainty and decreasing returns, assume that the amount of
spending xm in period m has a value that is given by αm v( xm ), where αm is a stochastic parameter
drawn from a known distribution Fα (·) with positive support and v(·) is a function that is increasing and concave.6 Conditional on observing the first-period value-of-spending parameter α1 , the
objective for the agency is

spending as the agency but also considers the opportunity cost of the budget it provides.7 At the

costs for Recovery Act projects that were below projections.
6 Allowing for predictable shifts in the distribution of the value of spending F over time (e.g., due to seasonality)
α
would not substantively change the predictions of the model. After netting out predictable changes in volume and
quality of spending, the results below would hold.
7 By modeling the agency and Congress as having the same preferences over spending, we do not consider settings
where the agency places a high value on projects that the Congress views as wasteful and vice versa. We view this
issue as interesting but conceptually distinct from the issue of how an agency spends its budget allocation over the
year. We cannot think of a prima facie reason why the mismatch between agency and Congress’s preferences should be
greater at the end of the year and no reason why the rollover counterfactual we examine would interact with this type
of allocative efficiency issue.

In this equation, x1∗ and x2∗ represent the optimal spending choices of the agency for a given level
of B, and λ represents the social cost of funds.8,9

2.2

Model Predictions

We now turn to predictions from the model. The agency always completely exhausts its budget by
the end of the year. This occurs, in the model, because the agency has positive returns to spending
and does not receive any value from returning resources to Congress. In practice, a ratchet effect
(Freixas, Guesnerie and Tirole, 1985) may further increase incentives for the agency to spend its
entire budget. If Congress interprets unspent resources as a signal of reduced need, then unspent
funding not only produces a loss of value in the current period but may also lead to lower budgets
in the future, further reducing the agency’s objective.10
For the results below, we assume the agency has a precautionary incentive to save resources
in the beginning of the year. In the consumption literature, this incentive exists if the consumption
function is concave in wealth (Carroll and Kimball, 1996; Carroll, 1997). In our context, agencies
have a precautionary incentive if the period 1 spending function x1 (α1 ) is concave in α1 . In Appendix Section A, we show that this property is satisfied by many standard value of spending
functions including Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA), Constant Relative Risk Aversion
(CRRA) with a parameter of γ ≥ 1 (which includes log as a special case), and quadratic. We
8 Our

model is similar to models of life-cycle consumption (see Attanasio and Weber (2010) and Carroll (2001) for
reviews), but there are two important distinctions. In life-cycle consumption models, uncertainty about future income
generates uncertainty in the future budget constraint. In our model, the budget constraint is inherently certain, but
there is uncertainty about the value of spending. Our parameterization of uncertainty can be viewed as the reduced
form of a model in which a value of spending is specified for every good or service in every state of nature. A second
distinction is that life-cycle models are designed to capture the date at which spending is consumed, and thus there
is an important distinction in these models between consumption goods that are consumed immediately and durable
goods that yield flow consumption over time. In contrast, we model the date that a contract is signed. Virtually all of
this spending—from the purchase of office supplies to advanced weapons systems—yields value to the agency over
time. The value of spending αm v( xm ) can be thought of as the present discounted value of these purchases.
9 Our setting also shares similarities with the problem of how to optimally fund and spend down a Flexible Spending
Account (Cardon and Showalter, 2001).
10 This ratchet effect could potentially have implications for optimal Congressional budget setting. We discuss this
issue in Section 5.

also provide sufficient conditions for x1 (α1 ) to be concave under any generic value of spending
function.
The first result concerns the volume of spending in each period.
Proposition 1 (Spike in Spending). The expected level of spending is strictly greater in period 2 than in
period 1 (i.e., E[ x2∗ ] > E[ x1∗ ]).
The proof is a direct application of Jensen’s inequality. Because of uncertainty and the concave
period 1 spending function, the agency on average holds back some spending in the first period
of the year. Because of expiring budgets, the agency then spends this entire amount in the second
period. The agency can be thought of as building up a rainy-day fund or of saving more than it
would in a risk-free environment due to the option value of future spending. The proofs for this
proposition and the proposition that follows are presented in Appendix Section A.
The next result concerns the quality of spending in each period. Define the quality of spending in period m as the value of spending per dollar of expenditure: qm = αm v( xm )/xm . Define
expected quality as the spending-weighted expectation of quality: q̄m = Ew(α) [qm ].11
Proposition 2 (Drop-off in Quality). The expected quality of spending is strictly lower in period 2 than
in period 1 (i.e., q̄2 < q̄1 ).
The result holds because the expected level of spending is higher in the second period and
the returns to spending are concave. Thus, the average quality of spending is lower in the second
period.
Finally, the model makes precise what we mean by wasteful year-end spending.
Definition 1 (Wasteful Year-end Spending). Wasteful spending is defined as spending for which the

marginal return to the agency is less than the social cost of funds (i.e., αm v0 ( xm

Because the agency spends all of its resources in the second period, when the agency draws a
sufficiently low value of α2 , some spending will occur with a value that is below the social cost of
funds. That is, agencies will engage in wasteful year-end spending.

of spending x (α) normalized by x (α)dFα so it integrates to 1. We weight by the level of spending so that our measure
of average quality is invariant to aggregation. This ensures that the quality measure is the same whether the agency has
a single $100 million project or two $50 million projects with the same quality score. We similarly weight by spending
in the baseline empirical analysis of the effect on quality, but also show that our results are similar when we do not
weight.
11 The

To summarize, decreasing returns and uncertainty can create an incentive for organizations to
build up a rainy-day fund in the first period, spending less than half of their budget on average. At
the end of the year, expected spending increases, average quality drops below that of the earlier
part of the year, and in some circumstances spending occurs despite having a value below the
marginal cost of funds.

Does Spending Spike at the End of the Year?

The predictions of the model are straightforward. Spending should spike at the end of the year,
and year-end spending should be of lower quality than spending during the rest of the year. Using
newly available data, we test these predictions, beginning in this section with the first prediction
that spending should spike at the end of the year.
For many types of government spending, there is little potential for a year-end spike. The 65
percent of U.S. federal spending that is made up of mandatory programs and interest on the debt
is not subject to the timing limitations associated with annual appropriations. The 13 percent of
spending that pays for compensation for federal employees is unlikely to exhibit an end-of-year
surge since new hires bring ongoing costs. This leaves procurement of goods and services from
the private sector as the main category of government spending in which an end-of-year spending surge could potentially occur. We therefore focus our empirical work on the procurement of
goods and services, a spending category that accounted for $538 billion or 15.3 percent of federal
spending in 2009 (up from $165 billion or 9.2 percent in 2000).
It is worth noting that even within procurement spending, there are categories of spending for
which it would be unlikely to observe an end-of-year spike. Some types of funding, such as military construction, come with longer spending horizons to provide greater flexibility to agencies.
Moreover, there are limits to what kinds of purchases can be made at year’s end.
In particular, federal law provides that appropriations are available only to “meet the bona
fide needs of the fiscal year for which they are appropriated.” Balances remaining at the end of the
year generally cannot be used to prepay for next year’s needs. A classic example of an improper
obligation is an order for gasoline placed 3 days before the end of the fiscal year to be delivered
in monthly installments throughout the following fiscal year (GAO, 2004). That said, when there

8

is an ongoing need and it is impossible to separate the purchase into components performed in
different fiscal years, it can be appropriate to enter into a contract in one fiscal year even though
a significant portion of the performance is in the subsequent fiscal year. In contrast, contracts
that are readily severable generally may not cross fiscal years unless specifically authorized by
statute.12

3.1

The Federal Procurement Data System

Falling technology costs and the government transparency movement have combined to produce
an extraordinary increase in the amount of government data available on the web (Fung, Graham and Weil, 2007; The Economist, 2010). As of October 2010, Data.gov had 2,936 U.S. federal
executive branch datasets available. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act
of 2006 required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to create a public website, showing every federal award, including the name of the entity receiving the award and the amount of
the award, along with other information. USAspending.gov was launched in December 2007 and
now contains extensive data on federal contracts, grants, direct payments, and loans.
The data currently available on USAspending.gov include the full Federal Procurement Data
System (FPDS) from 2000 to the present. FPDS is the data system that tracks all federal contracts.
Every new contract awarded as well as every follow-on contracting action, such as a renewal or
modification, results in an observation in FPDS. Up to 176 pieces of information are available for
each contract including dollar value, a four digit code describing the product or service being
purchased, the component of the agency making the purchase, the identity of the provider, the
type of contract being used (fixed price, cost-type, time and materials, etc.), and the type of bidding
mechanism used. While FPDS was originally created in 1978, agency reporting was incomplete
for many years, and we have been told by FPDS staff that it would be difficult or impossible
to assemble comprehensive data for years before 2000.13 Moreover, while FPDS is thought to
contain all government contracts from 2000 on, data quality for many fields was uneven before
12 Over

the past two decades, Congress has significantly expanded multi-year contracting authorities. For example,
the General Services Administration can enter into leases for periods of up to 20 years, and agencies can contract for
services from utilities for periods of up to 10 years.
13 Indeed, we attempted to download the pre-2000 data using the FPDS web-based “atom feed”. However, the aggregate level of spending and number of contracts in these data were significantly less than the amounts listed in government reports. For example, the FY 1999 Federal Procurement Reports lists that the government spent $198 billion on
contracts whereas our atom feed data only covered $99 billion in spending.

9

the 2003 FPDS modernization. Therefore, for most of the FPDS-based analyses in this paper, we
limit ourselves to data from fiscal years 2004 through 2009.14
Table 1 shows selected characteristics of the FPDS 2004 to 2009 sample. There were 14.6 million contracts awarded during this period, an average of 2.4 million per year. The distribution
of contract size is highly skewed. Ninety-five percent of contracts were for dollar amounts below $100,000, while 78 percent of contract spending is accounted for by contracts of more than $1
million. Seventy percent of contract spending is by the Department of Defense. The Department
of Energy and NASA, which rely on contractors to run large laboratories and production facilities, and the General Services Administration, which enters into government-wide contracts and
contracts on behalf of other agencies, are the next largest agencies in terms of spending over this
period. Twenty-nine percent of contract spending was sourced non-competitively; 20 percent was
on contracts that were sourced competitively but received only a single bid; and 51 percent was
on contracts that received more than one bid. Sixty-five percent of contract spending was on fixed
price contracts; 30 percent was on cost-reimbursement contracts; and 6 percent was on contracts
that paid on a time and materials or labor-hours basis.

3.2

The Within-Year Pattern of Government Procurement Spending

Figure 1 shows contract spending by week, pooling data from 2004 through 2009. There is a clear
spike in spending at the end of the year with 16.5 percent of all spending occurring in the last
month and 8.7 percent occurring in the last week of the year.15 The bottom panel shows that when
measured by the number of contracts rather than the dollar value, there is also clear evidence of an
end-of-the-year spike, with 12.0 percent of spending occurring in the last month and 3.5 percent
occurring in the last week.
Figure 1 also shows a spike in spending in the first week of the year, along with smaller spikes
at the beginning of each quarter. Appendix Table A1 shows that these increases are predominantly
due to property leases that reset on an annual basis, and service contracts with janitors and nurses
14 FPDS excludes classified contracts.

Data are made available in FPDS immediately after an award. However, during
wartime, the Department of Defense is permitted a 90 day delay to minimize the potential for disclosure of mission
critical information.
15 This pattern holds in each year. Over 2004 to 2009, the fraction of spending in the last month ranges from 14.8 to
20.1 percent and the fraction of spending in the last week ranges from 6.5 to 11.5 percent.

10

that reset periodically.16
Further evidence on the year-end rush-to-spend comes from the geographic distribution of
spending. A former procurement officer, stationed on the West Coast, told us that every September
30th at 9pm Pacific Time, he would receive a call from the East Coast, explaining that the fiscal
year had expired in the Eastern Time zone, and asking whether he had spending needs that could
be fulfilled in the remaining three hours in the Pacific Time zone’s fiscal year.
Figure 2 shows year-end spending by time zone. The data is split by whether the contract is
below the $100,000 threshold that generates larger oversight requirements and whether it occurred
in the last day of the year or in the last week of the year excluding the last day. Consistent with
this procurement officer’s experience, there is a 75 percent increase in Pacific Time Zone spending
on contracts of less than $100,000 in the last day of the year, and no effect in the other categories.
Appendix Table A2 shows this effect is robust to a rich set of controls.
Table 2 shows that the end of the year spending surge occurs in all major government agencies.
If spending were distributed uniformly throughout the year, we would expect to see 1.9 percent
in the final week of the year. No agency obligates less than 3.6 percent.
Table 3 shows the percent of spending on different types of goods and services that occurs
at the end of the year. The table shows some of the largest spending categories along with selected smaller categories that are very similar to the large categories. Construction-related goods
and services, furnishings and office equipment, and I.T. services and equipment all have end-ofyear spending rates that are significantly higher than average. These categories of spending often
represent areas where there is significant flexibility about timing for performing maintenance or
upgrading facilities and equipment, and which, because they represent on-going needs, have a
reasonable chance of satisfying the bona fide needs requirement even if spending is obligated at
the end of the year.
The categories of spending under the “Services” heading have end-of-year spending rates that
are near the average. For these kinds of services it will often be difficult to meet the bona fide need
requirement unless the services are inseparable from larger purchases, the services are necessary
16 The

final year of our data overlaps with the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
(ARRA), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009. While in principle ARRA might have changed incentives to
engage in wasteful year-end spending, actual year-end spending volumes in 2009 are very similar to those during the
rest of our sample. Last month spending is 16.9 percent in 2009 versus 16.5 percent in the pooled 2004 to 2009 sample;
last week spending is 8.7 percent in 2009 which is the same as the 8.7 percent in the pooled 2004 to 2009 sample.

11

to provide continuity into the beginning of the next fiscal year, or the services are covered by
special multiyear contracting authorities. Thus, it is not surprising that their rate of end-of-year
spending is lower than that for construction, for example. There are two categories of spending
where there is very little year-end surge. The first is ongoing expenses such as fuels for which
attempts to spend at the end of the year would represent a blatant violation of prohibitions against
paying for the following year’s expenses with current year appropriations. The second is military
weapons systems for which because of long planning horizons and the flexibility provided by
special appropriations authorities, one would not expect to see a concentration of spending at the
end of the year.
It is the exception rather than the rule for Congress to pass annual appropriations bills before
the beginning of the fiscal year. Between 2000 and 2009, the full annual appropriations process
was never completed on time. Analysts have attributed some of the challenges facing federal acquisition to the tardiness of the appropriations process, since these delays introduce uncertainty
and compress the time available to plan and implement a successful acquisition strategy (Acquisition Advisory Panel, 2007). In Appendix Section B we analyze the relationship between the timing
of the annual appropriations acts and the within-year pattern of government contract spending.
The estimates show that a delay of ten weeks—roughly the average over this time period—raises
the share of spending in the last quarter of the year by 2 percentage points from a base of about 27
percent and the share of spending occurring in the last week of the year by 1 percentage point on
a base of 9 percent.
Overall, the analysis in this section shows that the end-of-year spending surge is alive and
well, 30 years after Congress and the GAO focused significant attention on the problem and despite reforms designed to limit it. Moreover, claims that late appropriations increase the endof-year volume of contracting activity are accurate, suggesting that late appropriations may be
exacerbating the adverse effects of having an acquisition workforce operating beyond capacity at
the end of the year.
A surge in end-of-year spending does not necessarily imply bad outcomes. Agency acquisition staff can plan ahead for the possibility that extra funds will be available. Indeed, for large
contracts, weeks or even months of lead-time are generally necessary. The next section of the paper therefore analyzes the relative quality of end-of-year contract spending to explore whether
12

there are any adverse effects of the end-of-year spending surge.

Is End-of-Year Spending of Lower Quality?

Our model predicts that end-of-year spending will be of lower quality because agencies will spend
money at the end of the year on low-value projects and because the increased volume of contracting at the end of the year will lead to less effective management of those acquisitions. As mentioned in the introduction, it has been challenging historically to study contract quality because
of the limited availability of data measuring quality. In this section of the paper, we use a new
dataset that includes quality information on 686 of the most important federal I.T. procurements
to study whether end-of-the-year procurements are of lower quality.

4.1

I.T. Dashboard

Our data come from the federal I.T. Dashboard (www.itdashboard.gov), which tracks the performance of the most important federal I.T. projects. The I.T. Dashboard came online in beta form in
June, 2009 and provides the public with measures of the overall performance of major I.T. projects.
Like the USAspending.gov data discussed earlier, the I.T. Dashboard is part of a trend toward
“open government” and part of a shift in federal management philosophy toward monitoring
performance trends (rather than taking static snapshots of performance) and making the trends
public both for the sake of transparency and to motivate agencies to achieve high performance
(Metzenbaum, 2009).17
Along with the availability of performance data, studying federal I.T. projects has two other
advantages. The first is the ubiquity of I.T. spending. Major I.T. projects are carried out by nearly
all components of the U.S. federal government. Compared to an analysis of, say, the purchase of
military or medical equipment, an analysis of I.T. spending shines a much broader light on the
workings of government, allowing us to test our hypotheses across agencies with a wide range
of missions and organizational cultures. The second advantage is that federal I.T. spending is an
17 The

legislative foundation for the I.T. Dashboard was laid by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which established
Chief Information Officers at 27 major federal agencies and called on them to “monitor the performance of the information technology programs of the agency, [and] evaluate the performance of those programs on the basis of applicable
performance measurements.” The E-Government Act of 2002 built upon this by requiring the public display of these
data.

13

important and growing federal activity. Federal I.T. expenditure was $81.9 billion in 2010, and has
been growing at an inflation-adjusted rate of 3.8 percent over the past 5 years.18, 19
Finally, it should be noted that while we are duly cautious about external validity, the widespread
nature of I.T. investment across all types of organizations, including private sector ones, makes a
study of I.T. purchases more broadly relevant than other categories of spending for which the
federal government is the only purchaser. Not only do non-federal organizations buy similar
products under similar budget structures, but they often purchase these products from the same
firms that sell to U.S. federal agencies. These firms know the end-of-year budgeting game, and
if they play the game at the U.S. federal level, there may be reason to believe that they operate
similarly elsewhere.20

4.2

Data and Summary Statistics

The I.T. Dashboard displays information on major, ongoing projects at 27 of the largest agencies
of the federal government. The information is gleaned from Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300 forms that
agencies are required to submit to OMB, and is available on the Dashboard website. The data we
use were downloaded in March, 2010, when there were 761 projects being tracked.
For the analysis, we drop the 73 observations that are missing the quality measures, date of
award, or cost variables. We also drop two enormous projects because their size would cause
them to dominate all of the weighted regression results and because they are too high-profile to be
indicative of normal budgeting practices.21 This leaves us with a baseline sample of 686 projects
and $130 billion in planned total spending.
Appendix Table A3 shows the year of origination of these projects and the agencies at which
they occurred. Almost two-thirds of these projects (64.6 percent) and half of the spending (50.3
percent) originated in 2005 or later, although there are some ongoing projects that originated more

expenditure levels do not account for the social surplus from these projects. It is reasonable to think that
information systems used to monitor terrorist activities, administer Social Security payments, and coordinate the health
care of military veterans could have welfare impacts that far exceed their dollar costs.
20 See Rogerson (1994) for a discussion of the incentives facing government contractors.
21 These projects are a $45.5 billion project at the Department of Defense and a $19.5 billion project at the Department
of Homeland Security. The next largest project is $3.9 billion, and the average of the remaining observations is $219
million. Because the dropped observations have above average overall ratings and are not from the last week of the
year, omitting the observations works against us finding the effect predicted by our model.

than 20 years ago.22 The projects are distributed broadly across agencies. Although the Department of Defense, Department of Transportation, and Department of Veterans Affairs have higher
levels of spending, the vast majority of the agencies have at least 10 projects (21 of 27) and at least
$1 billion in aggregate spending (20 of 27).
The most prominent measure tracked by the I.T. Dashboard is the overall rating of the project,
which combines subindexes on cost, schedule, and performance. The cost rating subindex is based
on the absolute percent deviation between the planned and actual cost of the project. Projects that
are on average within 5 percent of the scheduled cost receive a score of 10, projects that are within
5 percent to 10 percent on average receive a score of 9, and so on down to zero. Because the
symmetric treatment of under- and over-cost projects is somewhat unnatural, we also construct
an alternative “cost overrun” index, which gives under-cost projects the highest scores and overcost projects the lowest. In this index, projects that are at least 45 percent under-cost receive a score
of 10, projects that are 35 percent to 45 percent under-cost receive a score of 9, and so on.
The schedule rating subindex is based on the average tardiness of the project across milestones, and takes on one of three values. Projects that are no more than 30 days overdue on
average receive a score of 10, projects that are between 30 and 90 days overdue on average receive
a score of 5, and projects that are more than 90 days overdue on average receive a score of 0.
The third subindex is a subjective Chief Information Officer (CIO) evaluation that is designed
to reflect the CIO’s “assessment of the risk of the investment’s ability to accomplish its goals.”23
CIO evaluations are determined by an agency-level I.T. review process, which combines input
from stakeholders such as program managers and Chief Acquisition Officers. The evaluations
and supporting documentation are key inputs into the government-wide “TechStat” review process, which forms the basis for annual I.T. budget requests. There are incentives for CIOs to rank
projects accurately. Contractors are likely to object to unjustifiably low scores. Issuing high scores
to projects that are ultimately viewed as low quality can be a source of embarrassment.24
Finally, it is important to note that CIO evaluations are not mutually exclusive of the cost and
22 We

address sample selection issues in the sensitivity section below.
particular, CIOs are instructed to assess risk management (e.g., mitigation plans are in place to address risks),
requirements management (e.g., investment objectives are clear and scope is controlled), contractor oversight (e.g.,
agency receives key reports), historical performance (e.g., no significant deviations from planned costs and schedule),
human capital (e.g., qualified management and execution team), and any other factors deemed important.
24 Of course, idiosyncratic measurement error in the dependent variable does not bias our estimates of the drop-off
in quality, although it can reduce the precision of our estimates.
23 In

15

schedule ratings, with the CIO explicitly instructed to consider deviations from planned cost and
schedule. A reason for this is that the cost and schedule subindices assess progress against current
milestones, but these milestones may have been reset after being missed in the past. Thus, the CIO
rating is able to account for risks associated with a project that has repeatedly missed milestones
in the past even if it is currently on track. The CIO rating is based on a 1-to-5 scale, with 5 being the
best.25 In constructing the overall rating, the I.T. Dashboard converts this 1-to-5 scale to a 0-to-10
scale by subtracting 1 and multiplying by 2.5.
The overall rating is constructed by taking an average of the three subindices, with the CIO
evaluation replacing the average if the CIO evaluation has a lower value.26 The overall rating falls
on a 0-to-10 scale with 10 being the best, and takes on non-integer values due to the averaging of
subindices. Additional information on the indices can be found in the FAQ of the I.T. Dashboard
website.
Appendix Table A4 shows summary statistics for the I.T. Dashboard sample. The average
project has a planned cost of $189 million and receives an overall rating of 7.1 out of 10. The
I.T. Dashboard includes information on a given project’s investment phase (e.g., planning, operations and maintenance), service group (e.g., management of government resources, services for
citizens), and line of business (e.g., communication, revenue collection). The bottom panel of the
table shows the distribution of the sample across these project characteristics. These variables,
along with agency and year fixed effects, are used as controls in the regression specifications.
To classify year-end projects, we use the date the first contract of the project was signed, creating an indicator variable for projects that originated in the last seven days of September, the
end of the fiscal year. Most I.T. projects are comprised of a series of contracts that are renewed
and altered as milestones are met and the nature of the project evolves. We think that using the
date the first contract was signed to classify the start date of the project is the best approach; the
key structure of the project is most likely determined at its onset. While future contract awards
may affect the quality of the project, we observe outcomes only at the project level. We view any

potential measurement error from our approach as introducing downward bias in our coefficient
of interest as contracts initially awarded before the last week of the year may be contaminated by
modifications made in the last week of a later year, and contracts initially awarded at the rush of
year’s end may be rectified at a later point.
Figure 3 shows the weekly pattern of spending in the I.T. Dashboard sample. As in the broader
FPDS sample, there is a spike in spending in the last week of the year. Spending and the number of projects in the last week increase to 7.2 and 8.3 times their rest-of-year weekly averages,
respectively. Alternatively put, while only accounting for 1.9 percent of the days of the year, the
last week accounts for 12.3 percent of spending and 14.0 percent of the number of projects. The
year-end spike in spending is more pronounced in the sample of projects with a value of less than
$100 million. Given the longer planning horizon for larger acquisitions, it is not surprising that
we see more of a year-end spike for the smaller contracts.27

4.3

The Relative Quality of Year-End I.T. Contracts

Figure 4 shows the distributions of the overall rating index for last-week-of-the-year projects and
projects from the rest of the year. In these histograms, the ratings on the 0 to 10 scale are binned
into 5 categories with the lowest category representing overall ratings less than 2, the second lowest representing overall ratings between 2 and 4, and so on. The top figure shows the distribution
weighted by planned spending, meaning that the effects should be interpreted in terms of dollars
of spending. These effects are closest to the theory, which makes predictions about the average
value of spending in the last period. To show that the effects are not being driven entirely by a
small number of high cost projects, Panel B shows the unweighted distribution of projects for the
last week and the rest of the year.
Consistent with the model, overall ratings are substantially lower at year’s end. Spending
in the last week of the year (Panel A) is 5.7 times more likely to have an overall rating in the
bottom two categories (48.7 percent versus 8.6 percent) compared to spending during the rest of
the year. Without weighting by spending, projects (Panel B) are almost twice as likely to be below
the central value (10.6 percent versus 5.7 percent).
27 As

in the broader FPDS sample, the end-of-year spike in the I.T. data is a broad phenomenon, not limited to a few
agencies.

17

To control for potentially confounding factors, we examine the effects of the last week within
an ordered logit regression framework. The ordered logit model is a latent index model where
higher values of the latent index are associated with higher values of the categorical variable. An
advantage of the ordered logit model is that by allowing the cut points of the latent index to be
endogenously determined, the model does not place any cardinal assumptions on the dependent
variable.28 In other worlds, the model allows for the range of latent index values that corresponds
to an increase in the overall rating from 1 to 2 to be of a different size than the range that corresponds to an increase from 2 to 3. In particular, letting i denote observations and j denote the
values of the categorical variable, the predicted probabilities from the ordered logit model are
given by

Pr(Overall_Ratingi > j) =

exp( β L Last_Week i + β j + Xi0 β X )
,
1 + exp( β L Last_Week i + β j + Xi0 β X )

where Last_Week is an indicator for the last week of the fiscal year, β j is an indicator for the overall
rating category, and Xi is a vector of control variables. See Greene and Hensher (2010) for a recent
treatment of ordered choice models.
Table 4 presents results from maximum likelihood estimates of the ordered logit model on the
I.T. dashboard sample. The estimates in the table are odds ratios. Recall that odds ratios capture
the proportional change in the odds of a higher categorical value associated with a unit increase in
the dependent variable, so that an odds ratio of 1/2 indicates that the odds of a higher categorical
value are 50 percent lower, or reciprocally that the odds of a lower categorical variable are 2 times
as great. The results in this table are weighted by inflation-adjusted spending.
The first column of the table shows the impact of a last week contract on the rating in a regression with no covariates. Columns 2 through 4 sequentially add in fixed effects for year, agency,
and project characteristics. In all of the specifications, the odds ratios are well below one—ranging
from 0.18 to 0.46—implying that last week spending is of significantly lower quality than spending in the rest of the year (the p-values are less than 0.01 in all specifications). The estimates imply
that spending that originates in the last week of the fiscal year has 2.2 to 5.6 times higher odds of
28 The standard ordered logit model used here does restrict the variables to have a proportional effect on the odds
of a categorical outcome. We fail to reject this assumption using a Brant test that compares the standard ordered logit
model with an alternative model that allows the effects to vary.

Sensitivity Analysis

This subsection explores the robustness of the basic estimates. It shows how the results vary
with different treatment of large contracts, with different functional form assumptions, and when
selection into the sample is taken into account.
Figure 4 showed that the finding that year-end projects are of lower quality was more pronounced in the dollar-weighted analysis than in the unweighted analysis, suggesting that a few
large, poorly performing contracts could be heavily affecting the results. Columns 1 to 4 of Table
5 contain results that analyze this issue. Columns 1 and 2 split the sample at the median contract
size of $62 million. Both coefficients are substantially below one, although the coefficient in column 1 is less precisely estimated. The point estimate in column 3 from an unweighted regression
is quite similar to the estimate in column 1 for the smaller contracts, but with added precision
from doubling the sample size by including the full sample (p-value of .02). Results in which we
Winsorize the weights, assigning a weight of $1 billion to the 4 percent of projects that are larger
than $1 billion, are about half way between the full sample weighted and unweighted results (pvalue less than 0.01). Overall, it is clear that the pattern of lower rating for end-of-year contracts is
a broad phenomenon. It is also clear that the sample contains several very large low-rated projects
that were originated in the last week of the year.30
Column 5 of Table 5 shows results from an ordinary least squares (OLS) model in which the
raw overall rating is regressed on an indicator for the contract originating in the last week of the
year and on controls. The regression coefficient of -1.00 shows that I.T. spending contracted in the
last week of the year receives ratings that are on average a full point lower on the 0 to 10 rating
scale. This estimate confirms that the finding of lower quality year-end spending is not limited to
the ordered logit functional form.
An important feature of our sample is that it reflects only active I.T. projects. Projects that have
29 In

addition to the results from the last week of the year, we have also examined spending in the last month of the
year. We find this spending is of moderately lower quality than that in the first 11 months of the year. We have also
examined the quality of spending in the first week of the year (which also spikes). The point estimate for the first week
of the year suggests somewhat higher spending quality, but the odds ratio is not significantly different from 1.0.
30 The stronger effect for larger contracts need not result from contract size per se, but could occur if large contracts
are more complex on average. For example, if small projects are more likely to be routine “off-the-shelf” I.T. systems,
then there might be less downside risk to these projects than large, unique projects originated at the end of the year.

19

already been completed or projects that were terminated without reaching completion are not in
our sample. Unfortunately, because the I.T. Dashboard and the CIO ratings are brand new, it is
not possible to acquire rating information on the major I.T. projects that are no longer ongoing.
Ideally, one would want a sample of all major I.T. projects that originated in a particular period
in time. The bias introduced by the way in which our sample was constructed most likely leads
us to underestimate the end-of-year effect. In particular, very bad contracts begun in the last week
of the year are likely to be canceled and would not appear in our data set. Similarly, very well
executed contracts from earlier in the year are likely to be completed ahead of schedule and also
not appear in our data set. Thus, our estimates likely understate the gap in quality that we would
find if we could compare all contracts from the last week of the year with all contracts from the
rest of the year.
To explore the extent of bias that a selection mechanism like the one just described might
introduce into our estimates, we assembled a dataset of all 3,859 major I.T. projects that originated
between 2002 and 2010. We were able to assemble this dataset using the annual Exhibit 53 reports
that allow OMB to track I.T. projects across the major federal agencies. These data show that more
recently originated projects are significantly more likely to be in our sample. Our sample contains
85 percent of the total spending on projects that originated in 2007 or later and only 28 percent of
the spending on projects that originated before this date.
A simple way to assess whether there is selection is to estimate the model on samples split
into earlier and later years. A difference in the coefficient of interest across samples, given the
assumption that there is no time trend in the effect, would be indicative of selection bias. Given
this assumption, however, we can estimate the parameter of interest exactly by using the date
of project origination to identify a selection correction term. Column 6 implements this strategy,
showing estimates from a Heckman selection model in which the year of origination is excluded
from the second stage. The results show a larger effect than the corresponding OLS estimate, but
the lack of precision means that we cannot rule out that the effects are the same.31 The negative
coefficient on the selection term, although statistically indistinguishable from zero, suggests that
lower quality projects are, on net, more likely to remain in the sample over time.
31 Consistent with this finding, OLS estimates on a sample split in 2007 show a larger point estimate in the later years,
but we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficients are the same.

20

4.5

Alternative Mechanisms

The results from the I.T. Dashboard show that, consistent with the predictions of our model, yearend spending is of lower quality than spending obligated earlier in the year. In our discussion
of the model, we posited two potential channels for this effect: agencies may save low priority
projects for the end of the year and undertake them only if they have no better uses for the funds,
and the high volume of contracting activity at the end of the year might result in less management
attention per project.
There are, however, other mechanisms that could lead to a drop-off in quality—and have
different implications for the counterfactual of allowing agencies to roll over unused funds into
the subsequent year. One such mechanism is procrastination.32 If the contracting officers who
do a worse job of planning, writing, or managing contracts are also inclined to procrastinate,
then we may see a surge of low quality contracts at the end of the year because that is when
the least effective acquisition professionals get their contracts out the door. This mechanism has
different policy implications because allowing agencies to roll over funds would not necessarily
improve outcomes: the least effective acquisition professionals would simply issue their contracts
at a different time of year.
To evaluate the importance of this mechanism, we estimate regression specifications that
control for contracting office fixed effects, allowing us to compare the relative performance of
projects procured by the same acquisition professionals at different points in time. In particular,
we worked to obtain data on the contracting office for each contract and merged this information
with the I.T. Dashboard dataset.33 The data on contracting offices is incomplete, but does allow us
to identify the contracting offices for 38 percent of the spending ($48 billion out of $125 billion) and
41 percent (275 of 671) of the projects in our data. Importantly, most of the spending (82 percent)
and projects (84 percent) occur at contracting offices that are involved with more than one project,
allowing us to use variation within contracting offices.
Columns 1 and 2 of Table A8 show the results of this analysis. We show coefficients from linear regressions because the maximum likelihood estimates of the ordered logit model with a large
32 We

offices are composed of a small number of contracting specialists, technical assistants, and program
managers. As of 2010, there were 35,048 contracting series employees (GS-1102) in the Federal Government (Federal
Acquisition Institute, 2011) and 8,829 unique contracting offices, an average of 4.0 contracting professionals per office.
33 Contracting

21

number of fixed effects does not reliably converge. The drop-off in quality is similar in magnitude
to the baseline estimate of -1.00. While the weighted estimate is imprecise, the unweighted specification is statistically distinguishable from zero at the 2 percent level. Therefore, the evidence
does not suggest that our results stem from worse contracting offices disproportionally writing
year-end contracts.
Another mechanism that could lead to a drop-off in quality is priority-based contracting. Suppose agencies (i) fund a fixed set of projects and (ii) undertake projects in priority order, starting
with the highest quality. This mechanism will naturally lead to declining average quality over the
course of the year. However, this mechanism will not, by itself, generate an increase in the volume
of spending at year’s end. But, if we make the additional assumption that agencies undertake a
large number of low priority projects, we can generate a spike in spending at the end of the year.
In this model, agencies always undertake the same set of projects and there is no welfare loss from
wasteful year-end spending.
Because agencies undertake a fixed set of projects, a key prediction of this priority-based
model is that allowing rollover does not affect the volume of year-end spending. As we discuss in
more detail in Section 5, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has obtained special authority to roll over
unused budget authority for I.T. projects into a fund that can be used on I.T. expenditure in the
following year. We show that DOJ does not have an economically significant spike in the volume
of I.T. spending, with only 3.4 percent of I.T. spending occurring in the last week of the year compared to 9.3 percent for non-I.T. spending. We also conduct difference-in-differences analysis that
compares I.T. and non-I.T. spending at DOJ and other agencies and show that rollover reduces the
volume of year-end spending by 9.5 percentage points. This effect is estimated using thousands
of contracts and has a p-value of less than 0.1 percent.
Additional evidence against this alternative model comes from examining the second moment
of the volume and quality data. In our model of wasteful year-end spending, value-of-spending
shocks, α, accumulate throughout the year such that there should be significantly more variation
(i.e., a larger second moment) in the volume and the quality of spending at the end of the year. This
higher variance occurs because sometimes agencies receive several low value-of-spending shocks
over the course of the year, resulting in substantial remaining budget authority at the end of the
year and a high volume of low quality spending. At other times, agencies accumulate several
22

high value-of-spending shocks so that they have little money left to spend at the end of the year
and therefore engage in a low volume of high quality spending.34 In the priority-based model,
variation in the deterministic list of projects might create some variation in within-year spending
patterns but there is no a priori reason why there should be relatively more variation in spending
volumes or spending quality at the end of the year.
Appendix Table A9 investigates these two predictions. Columns 1 and 2 show the standard
deviation of weekly spending volumes in the last week and the rest-of-the-year in the full FPDS
data. This analysis is conducted using a dataset in which the observations are annual percentages
of spending by agency and by week. Column 1 shows the standard deviations in the raw data,
and column 2 shows the standard deviations after partialling out agency and year fixed effects.35
The table shows that there is significantly more variation at the end of the year, with 50 percent
higher standard deviations across both specifications.
Columns 3 and 4 examine the standard deviation of the overall ratings of project quality in
the I.T. Dashboard data. This analysis is conducted using the project-level data and is weighted
by spending on each project so that the standard deviations can by interpreted as the variation
per dollar of expenditure. Column 3 shows the standard deviations in the raw data and column
4 shows standard deviations after partialling out agency, year, and product characteristic fixed
effects. The table shows that the variation in project quality at the end of the year is higher in both
specifications.
The increased variation in volume and quality at the end of the year is inconsistent with the
priority-based model. At the same time, the increased variation is crucial to the welfare gains from
rollover because it implies there are states of the world where the value of spending is well below
the social cost of funds and would be avoided if the agency could roll over these funds into the
subsequent year. Thus, this evidence not only distinguishes between these models but shows they
are different on exactly the dimension that generates the conflicting welfare predictions.
A final mechanism that could explain the year-end drop-off in quality but would have different policy implications is reverse causality. If CIOs give a project a low overall rating not because

have confirmed these predictions in simulations of the calibrated model.
yijt denote the percentage of spending at agency i in year j and week t. Columns 1 show the standard deviation
of yijt for week t = 52 and week t < 52. To construct the estimates in column 2, we run the regression yijt = δi + δj + eijt
where δi and δj and agency and year fixed effects, construct the residuals eijt = yijt − δi − δj , and then show the standard
deviation of eijt for week t = 52 and week t < 52.
35 Let

23

it is low quality but because the CIO recalls it being originated in the end-of-year rush then our
finding would be spurious and a policy response would not be justified.36
To evaluate this issue, we examine whether the drop-off in quality is relatively stronger for
CIOs who have had a longer tenure at their agency and for whom the timing of project origination
is likely to be more salient. If the drop-off is stronger for CIOs who were present for the start of the
project, then we might be worried about this reverse casualty channel. To conduct this analysis,
we obtained CIO biographical statements and used the information in these statements to split
the sample into projects for which the CIO has a tenure of more than 3 years at the agency (357 of
671 projects) and projects for which the CIO has a tenure of 3 years or less (235 of 671 projects).37
Columns 3 and 4 of Table A8 show odds ratios from ordered logit regressions on the longer and
shorter tenure samples. The odds ratios are significantly below 1 and similar across both samples,
suggesting that reverse causality is unlikely to be a concern.

4.6

Why Are Year-End Contracts of Lower Quality?

To further explore the mechanism behind poor end-of-year contracts, we examine the subcomponents of the overall rating to see which subindices are responsible for the result. Appendix Table
A5 repeats our main ordered logit analysis with each subindex as the dependent variable. The
results show clearly that it is the evaluation by the agency CIO that is responsible for the main
finding. Neither the cost rating nor the schedule rating has an odds ratio that is significantly different from 1. The CIO evaluation shows that the odds of having a higher rating are one-sixth
as high for last-week-of-the-year contracts. The coefficient in the CIO regression is insensitive to
adding the cost rating and scheduling rating into the regression, suggesting that it is information
in the CIO rating that is not incorporated in the other ratings that is responsible for the result.
This finding is not all that surprising. As previously mentioned, the I.T. Dashboard explicitly
places more faith in the CIO’s assessment than in the other components by allowing the CIO
assessment to override the other components if it is lower than the other components. Moreover,
the ability to reset milestone targets makes it difficult to assess the cost and schedule ratings. But
while not surprising, the fact that it is the CIO evaluation that is driving the result means that

we cannot learn much about the mechanism from the subindices, since the CIO evaluation is a
comprehensive measure of the I.T. project’s performance.
Another way to explore possible mechanisms is to examine whether other observable features of end-of-year contracts are different from those earlier in the year. Specifically, we examine
whether features that policymakers often define as high risk—such as lack of competitive bidding
or use of cost-reimbursement rather than fixed cost pricing—are more prevalent in end-of-year
contracts. For this analysis, we return to the FPDS sample of all contracts from 2004 to 2009. To
facilitate the analysis, we aggregate the 14.6 million observations up to the level of the covariates.
We then estimate linear probability models with indicators for contract characteristics (e.g., a noncompetitively sourced indicator) as the dependent variable on an indicator for last week of the
fiscal year and controls. The regressions are weighted by total spending in each cell.
Columns 1 and 2 of Appendix Table A6 examine shifts in the degree of competitive sourcing at
the end of the year. The use of non-competitive contracts shows little change. However, contracts
that are competitively sourced are significantly more likely to receive only one bid, perhaps because the end-of-year rush leaves less time to allow bidding to take place. The estimates indicate
that there is almost a 10 percent increase in contracts receiving only a single bid—a 1.7 percentage point increase on a base of 20 percent. On net, then, there is a modest increase in “risky”
non-competitive and one-bid contracts at the end of the year.
Columns 3 and 4 investigate the type of contract used. Because of their open-ended financial risk, contracts that provide for cost reimbursement rather than specifying a fixed price often
require the contracting officer to obtain extra layers of approval—approval that may be difficult
to obtain during the end-of-the-year crunch. Column 3 shows that cost-reimbursement contracts
are 3.2 percentage points less likely at the end of the year, conditional on detailed controls for the
product or service purchased. The use of time and material or labor hours (T&M/LH), which
also provide cost-based reimbursement, increases by 0.4 percentage points at the end of the year.
T&M/LH contracts are often used when a contracting officer doesn’t have time to specify the exact
requirements of a contract.
Overall, the analysis in this section provides some evidence on the causes of lower performance at the end of the year. The shift in contract type and the rise in competitively sourced
contracts that receive only one bid is consistent with a mechanism in which contracting officers
25

face substantial time pressure at the end of the year, obtaining fewer bids for each contract and
choosing to use less time-intensive contract vehicles when they have sufficient discretion. The
evidence does not allow us to assess the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other
potential explanations, such as that agencies save lower priority projects for the end of the year
and undertake them only if funds permit.

Allowing for Rollover

The existence of wasteful year-end spending raises the question of whether anything can be done
to reduce it. Reducing uncertainty would be helpful but is infeasible in practice for many organizations due to the inherent unpredictability of some types of shocks. A natural way to increase
efficiency would be to allow organizations to roll over budget authority across years. Under such
a system, budgeting would still occur on an annual basis, but rather than expiring at year’s end,
unused funds would be added to the newly granted budget authority in the next year.
The idea that budget authority should last for longer than one year is not new. Article 1,
Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the power of taxation to fund 17 categories of
expenditure. For one of these categories, “To raise and support armies”, the Framers placed a
time limit on budget authority, specifying that “no appropriation of money to that use shall be
for longer term than two years.” For all other categories, no limit was specified, suggesting that
periods longer than two years were potentially desirable in a broad range of circumstances.
More recently, Jones (2005) has argued for extending the U.S. federal government’s obligation
period from 12 to 24 months, and McPherson (2007) has recommended that agencies be allowed
to carry over unused budget authority for one-time or emergency use for an additional year. The
federal government of Canada has adopted a version of rollover, allowing agencies to carry over
up to 5 percent of their budget authority across years. In response to concerns over wasteful
year-end spending, Oklahoma and Washington also allow their agencies to roll over their budget
authority to some extent.38 Finally, within the U.S. federal government, the Department of Justice
(DOJ) has obtained special authority to transfer unused budget authority to an account that can
be used for capital and other similar expenditure in future years.39

5.1

Extending the Model

To allow for rollover, we extend the model to an infinite horizon setting. At the beginning of each
year, denoted y = 1, 2, 3, . . ., Congress decides on a budget By for the agency. In each month,
m = 1, 2, . . . M, the agency learns about the value of spending in that period αy,m and chooses
a spending level xy,m accordingly. Indexes update like a standard calendar: The index {y, m} is
followed by {y, m + 1} if m < M and {y + 1, 1} if m = M.
Agency’s problem. It is easiest to present the agency problem in recursive form. Let Vm ( Ay,m )
be the month-specific, present value to the agency from entering a period {y, m} with Ay,m assets.
Let β denote the monthly discount factor. The agency’s problem is to choose a level of spending
to maximize the value of current period spending plus the discounted expected value of next
period’s value function:

Vm ( Ay,m ) =

max

Ay,m ≥ xy,m ≥0



αy,m v( xy,m ) + βEy,m Vm+1 ( Ay,m+1 ) .

In periods before the end of the year, next period’s assets are current assets minus spending. At
the end of the year, next period’s assets are a new budget allocation plus a function g( Ay,M − xy,M )
of remaining assets.

Ay,m+1 =



 Ay,m − xy,m

if m < M


 By+1 + g( Ay,M − xy,M ) if m = M
The no-rollover case is given by g( Ay,M − xy,M ) = 0; full rollover is given by g( Ay,M − xy,M ) =
Ay,M − xy,M
Congress’s problem. As before, Congress places the same value on spending as the agency
but also considers the opportunity cost of funds. Let Ãy ≡ g( Ay−1,M − xy−1,M ) indicate the resources that the agency rolls over from year y − 1 to year y. The recursive form of Congress’s
problem is

Congressional Commitment

The benefit of rollover depends on the degree to which Congress can refrain from raiding the
agency’s rolled over funds. Suppose full rollover is permitted by law: g( Ay,M − xy,M ) = Ay,M −
xy,M . Consider the case in which Congress cannot commit to a budget rule.
Proposition 3 (No Commitment). If Congress cannot commit to a budget rule, the agency will never roll
over any budget authority, and allowing rollover will not produce an efficiency gain.
To see this, notice that at the beginning of each year, Congress’s problem yields an optimal
level of assets for the agency that equates the expected marginal value of spending to the social cost of funds. It follows that if the agency rolls over an additional dollar, it is optimal for
Congress to reduce the agency’s budget allocation to fully offset this amount. Since the agency
values spending, it will be better off spending all of its resources by year’s end and not rolling
over any budget authority. The formal proof for this proposition, and the proposition below, can
be found in Appendix Section A.
Now suppose that Congress can commit to a budget rule By∗ = Γ( Ay−1,M − xy−1,M ) that could
depend on the amount of rolled over funds.
Proposition 4 (Full Commitment). If Congress can commit to a budget rule, it is optimal for Congress
to provide a constant budget that does not depend on the level of rolled over resources (i.e., By∗ = B̄), and
welfare will be higher than in the no-rollover scenario.
Because Congress places the same value on spending as the agency, it wants to avoid distorting the agency’s inter-temporal spending decisions. It does this by making future budgets unconditional on the amount of rolled over funds.40 Agency spending does not spike at the end of the
40 This

result shares intuition with results on optimal unemployment insurance in the presence of hidden savings
(Abdulkadiroglu, Kuruscu and Sahin, 2002; Kocherlakota, 2004). In these papers, hidden savings weakens the link
between optimal unemployment benefits and the length of time unemployed. Here, if Congress can commit to a
budget rule, it is similarly optimal for future budget allocations to be unconditional on the amount of rolled over funds.

28

year, and there is no year-end drop-off in quality. The only difference between full commitment
and the first-best is that agencies cannot borrow.
This result also implies that it is never optimal for the budget office to offer to share savings
with an agency, for example by allowing agencies to keep 50 percent of unused funds and then
applying the remaining 50 percent to deficit reduction. So long as the portion of unused funds
retained by the agency is below 100 percent, agencies will have an incentive to do some spending
with a value below the social cost of funds.41
Finally, the model does not exhibit a ratchet effect phenomenon (Freixas, Guesnerie and Tirole,
1985), in which the pattern of spending over the year provides an informative signal to Congress
on the social value of spending at the agency. This is because the pattern of spending is only indicative of the relative magnitude of the value of spending shocks αy,m compared to their expected
value E[αy,m ] and does not in general provide information on their absolute magnitude, which is
what determines Congress’s budget allocation.42,43

5.3

Empirical Evidence

To explore whether allowing rollover gives rise to the type of beneficial effects that are predicted by
the full commitment equilibrium, we examine procurement data from the Department of Justice.
In 1992, the Department of Justice (DOJ) obtained special authority to roll over up to 4 percent of
annual revenue into a fund that could be used for up to five years on I.T. and related projects.44
DOJ has been using this authority, rolling over $1.8 billion during the 1994 to 2006 period (Senate,
2006), yet may be worried about commitment. In a recent report, Senator Tom Coburn criticized
41 There are institutional factors that help Congress commit to allowing rollover. Congress and agencies play a repeated game. If Congress raids an agency’s rolled over resources in one year, the agency may play a trigger strategy,
never rolling over funds in the future. If multiple agencies were permitted rollover, Congress might be concerned about
its reputation, and refrain from raiding an agency’s rainy-day fund to avoid discouraging other agencies from rolling
over their resources.
42 To see this, consider a setting with two periods, no rollover, and a spike in spending at the end of the year. Based on
this pattern of spending, Congress is able to infer that the agency received a below average draw for α in the first period
of the year. The pattern of spending, however, cannot be used to determine the average value of spending, which is
what determines Congress’s budget allocation.
43 There are a number of extensions to the model that would be interesting to consider. For instance, what is the effect
of asymmetric information between Congress and the agency or of a principle-agent setup where moral hazard by the
agency is a central concern.
44 In particular, the law allows the transfer of unobligated balances into the “capital account of the Working Capital
Fund to be available for the department-wide acquisition of capital equipment, development and implementation of
law enforcement or litigation related automated data processing systems, and for the improvement and implementation
of the Department’s financial management and payroll/personnel systems.” (Public Law 102-140, 28 USC 527) See:

the agency for its behavior, stating, “Every year the Department ends the year with billions of
unspent dollars. But instead of returning this unneeded and unspent money to the taxpayers, the
DOJ rolls it over year to year” (Coburn, 2008).
To examine the effects of rollover, we return to the data on the volume and quality of contract
spending analyzed in Sections 3 and 4. Table 6 presents difference-in-differences estimates of
the effect of the DOJ rollover authority on the volume of year-end spending. Rows compare the
fraction of spending that occurs in the last week of the year at DOJ and at other agencies; columns
compare I.T. and non-I.T. projects. The first row shows that at other agencies, 8.5 percent of nonI.T. spending occurs in the last week of the fiscal year; for I.T. projects, 12.1 percent of spending
occurs in the last week of the year. At DOJ, the fraction of non-I.T. spending that occurs in the last
week of the year is 9.3 percent, similar to the government-wide average. Whereas at other agencies
the fraction of I.T. spending that occurs in the last week of the year is above the fraction of non-I.T.
spending, at DOJ it is significantly lower. At DOJ, only 3.4 percent of I.T. spending occurs in the
last week of the year, much closer to the 1.9 percent that would result from constant expenditure
over the year. The difference-in-differences estimate is a decline of 9.5 percentage points, with a
p-value of less than 0.1 percent.
Because DOJ has relatively little end-of-year I.T. spending, there is less data to look at the
effects on quality. Table 7 shows difference-in-differences estimates of the effect on overall ratings
using the I.T. Dashboard data. At other agencies, last-week I.T. projects have overall ratings that
are 1.9 points lower than rest-of-year projects on average. DOJ has 15 I.T. projects in the Dashboard
with only 1 occurring in the last week of the year. This project has the highest overall rating of all
the projects undertaken by DOJ and is 1.6 points higher than the average. While one should be
cautious in interpreting a result that comes from a single observation, a difference-in-differences
estimate shows how unlikely it is that the one end-of-year DOJ I.T. project would be of such high
quality if there were no effect of rollover—the DOJ rollover variable has a p-value that is below
.01. Appendix Table A10 show the result is robust across a broad set of regression specifications.
In sum, the DOJ data provide empirical support for beneficial effects of rollover. Allowing for
the rollover of I.T. funds leads to a substantial decrease in the volume of year-end I.T. spending at
DOJ relative to other agencies, and also seems to lead to an increase in project quality.

5.4

Calibrating the Welfare Gains

The results in the previous section—that permitting rollover eliminates the spike in spending and
the associated decline in quality—gives an indication of the potential welfare gains from permitting rollover. But the theoretical model suggests that a deeper assessment is needed. In particular,
rollover should improve the quality of spending over the front part of the year as well. For instance, in the beginning of the year, agencies with a high value of spending can tap into funds
rolled over from the previous period. Moreover, the gains from permitting rollover depend on
how Congress reacts to rolled-over funds. To study these types of effects and to consider more
generally the welfare gains from alternative rollover policies, we calibrate the infinite horizon
model to fit the spike in spending and the drop-off in quality at the end of the year.
The model is characterized by a parameter that determines the curvature of the value of
spending function and a parameter that determines the distribution of spending shocks. We calibrate these parameters such that simulated data from the model has the same spike in spending
and drop-off in quality that we observed in the federal procurement data. In our baseline calibration, we specify a CRRA v( x ) =

x 1− γ
1− γ

value of spending function with curvature parameter γ and

a log normal ln α ∼ N (0, σ) distribution of spending shocks with standard deviation σ. We set the
number of months per year to M = 12 and the monthly discount factor to β = 0.996.45 We normalize the social cost of funds to λ = 1. While the specific quantitative results are dependent on
the chosen functional form, we show in the appendix that results are quite similar with a CARA
spending function. Full details on the calibration can be found in Appendix Section C.
As a first step, we assess the welfare gains from rollover by comparing the non-rollover status
quo to three alternative scenarios. In the first scenario, we allow rollover, but reduce the agency’s
budget authority to produce the same expected value of spending as in the no-rollover regime.
This can be thought of as an estimate of the compensating variation from allowing rollover. Appendix Table A13 shows that Congress could allow rollover, reduce the agency’s budget by 13
percent, and the value of spending would be identical to the status quo.
The second scenario examines the welfare gain from rollover when Congress can re-optimize
the budget it provides to the agency. In our simulations Congress chooses to reduce the agency’s
45 This

monthly discount factor implies an annual discount factor of 0.95 = 0.99612 .

31

budget allocation by an amount that turns out to be similar to the reduction in the compensating
variation scenario because agencies on average enter the year with rolled-over funds, so Congress
does not need to provide as much funding to ensure that the agency can take advantage of high
α periods. Moreover, this effect outweighs the greater willingness of Congress to provide funds
in a rollover environment given that agencies will not squander them on projects with a value
below the social cost of funds. The welfare gains in this Congressional reoptimization scenario are
slightly higher than those in the compensating variation scenario.
The third scenario examines the welfare gains from the first-best level of spending, defined
as the level of spending that equates the marginal social value of spending to the marginal social
cost of funds in each period. Compared to rollover, which effectively allows agencies to save,
the first-best effectively allows agencies both to save and to borrow. The welfare gains from this
counterfactual are approximately 19 percent, but are an upper bound because, in the real world,
agencies can acquire extra resources in extenuating circumstances through mid-year supplemental
appropriations from Congress, a channel we do not model in our rollover scenario.
Whether these welfare gains can be achieved depends on Congress’s ability to commit to
future budgets. While Congress cannot completely tie its own hands, it can design policies to
increase the likelihood of commitment. For example, Congress could specify that rolled-over
amounts are not reported in standard budget tables, increasing the cost of obtaining this information. Our analysis shows that small commitment probabilities can achieve relatively large welfare gains. We conduct a counterfactual analysis where with probability π Congress commits and
agencies are able to roll over the full amount of unspent resources into the next year, and with
probability 1 − π Congress reneges and unspent resources are taken from the agency and valued
in the welfare function at the social cost of funds. Panel A of Appendix Figure A3 shows that a 25
percent commitment probability leads to welfare gains of more than half the full rollover value, as
agencies prefer to roll over their funds than engage in flat-of-the-curve spending at the end of the
year.
We also use the model to examine the effect of two intermediate policies. The first is to allow
agencies to roll over funding for a time-limited grace period.46 Such a grace period would not
simply result in a spike in spending at the new deadline. Because next year’s budget authority
46 We

thank Dan Feenberg for suggesting this counterfactual.

32

would provide a de facto rainy day fund, even a few months of rollover would allow agencies to
draw down their previous year’s savings over a longer time period while using next year’s allotment to insure against large spending needs.47 We find that a one-month grace period achieves 41
percent of the welfare gains from full rollover; a two-month grace period achieves 66 percent; and
a four-month grace period 90 percent (see Panel B of Appendix Figure A3).
The second alternative is for Congress to provide more funding on a multi-year basis. While
the full implications of less frequent fiscal policy are outside the scope of this paper, one benefit
of multi-year budgeting is that it reduces the frequency of wasteful year-end spending. In our
calibrated model, we find that two-year budget cycles achieve 70 percent of the gains from full
rollover and three-year budget cycles achieve 90 percent (see Panel C of Appendix Figure A3).
The results are subject to a number of caveats. We assume that agencies—and their employees—
do not have self-control problems. If agencies are prone to procrastinate, for example, then a yearend deadline may force agencies to get languishing projects out the door, providing a benefit that
could offset some of the cost of lower quality spending.
Another assumption we make is that agencies cannot achieve the equivalent of rollover today
by purchasing fungible goods or “parking” funds in contracts that can be repurposed at the end
of the year. The empirical analysis showed relatively little year-end spending in the most fungible
categories—such as fuels, lubricants, oils and waxes—and we would not see a drop-off in quality
if funds were used in this manner. To the extent some funding is already rolled over through such
methods, the benefits of legally permitting rollover would be reduced.

6

Conclusion

Our model of an organization facing a fixed period in which it must spend its budget resources
made three predictions. We have confirmed all three using data on U.S. federal contracting. First,
there is a surge of spending at the end of the year. Second, end-of-year spending is of lower
quality. Third, permitting the rollover of spending into subsequent periods eliminates the end-ofyear spending surge and appears to lead to higher quality.
47 Because Congress rarely passes a budget on schedule and agencies are operating under continuing resolutions, this
partial rollover period often will have expired by the time that a new budget is determined. In this case, Congress
would have no incentive to take this rolled-over amount into consideration.

33

Our welfare simulations suggest that most of the inefficiency from wasteful year-end spending could be eliminated with relatively modest changes to budget procedures—for example, by
allowing agencies to roll over unused funds into the next fiscal year for use during a four-month
grace period.
In evaluating possible policy reforms, one should not lose sight of the potential benefits of
one-year budget periods. Shorter appropriations cycles may produce benefits from greater Congressional control over executive branch operations. The use-it-or-lose it feature of appropriated
funds may push projects out the door that would otherwise languish due to bureaucratic delays.
And there may be institutional barriers to achieving the full benefits illustrated in the welfare simulations. For example, unless the rollover balances stay with the same part of the organization that
managed to save them, agency subcomponents will still have an incentive to use up the entirety
of their allocations.
While a full assessment of potential policy reforms is beyond the scope of this paper, two
things are clear. First, the conventional wisdom expressed in GAO (1998) that the federal endof-year spending problem was largely solved with the budget process reforms of the early 1980s
is wrong. There remains a large surge in spending in the last week of the year. Second, this
spending surge has real consequences. Our finding that year-end I.T. spending is of lower quality
demonstrates for the first time that the end-of-year spending surge does in fact result in lower
quality spending.

east (ET) for the contiguous U.S. The y-axis shows the percent of year-end spending in that time zone
relative to the percent of year-end spending in ET to normalize for different levels of spending by time
period and contract size. Spending values inflation-adjusted to 2009 dollars using the CPI-U.

A

Proofs

A.1

Proposition 1

Let x1 (α1 ) denote the agency’s period 1 spending conditional on shock α1 . We first show that
x1 (E[α1 ]) = B/2. Recall that α1 and α2 are drawn from the same distribution and that the valueof-spending function, v( x ), is increasing and concave. Because v(·) is increasing, the constraint
x1 + x2 ≤ B will bind with equality. Substituting this constraint into the first period objective, the
first-order condition for the agency becomes α1 v0 ( x1 ) − E[α2 ]v0 ( B − x1 ) = 0. Substituting E[α1 ] for
α1 yields E[α1 ]v0 ( x1 ) − E[α2 ]v0 ( B − x1 ) = 0. Because E[α1 ] = E[α2 ], this implies v0 ( x1 ) − v0 ( B −
x1 ) = 0 and therefore x1 (E[α1 ]) = B/2.
Suppose that x1 (α1 ) is concave. Given this assumption, Jensen’s inequality implies that E[ x1 (α1 )] <
x1 (E[α1 ]) = B/2. Because E[ x1 ] < B/2 and E[ x2 ] = B − E[ x1 ] > B/2, it follows that E[ x2 ] >
E[ x1 ].
Below we show that x1 (α1 ) is concave when the value of spending function, v( x ), is Constant
Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA), Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) with a parameter of
γ ≥ 1 (which includes log as a special case), and quadratic. We provide sufficient conditions for
x1 (α1 ) to be concave under any generic value of spending function.
The CARA value of spending function is defined by v( x ) = − exp(−rx ) with r > 0. For a
given α1 , the first order condition for period 1 spending is α1 r exp(−rx1 ) = E[α2 ]r exp(−r ( B −
ln(α1 /E[α2 ])
x1 )), yielding the period 1 spending function x1 (α1 ) = B2 +
. Differentiation shows that
2r
x10 (α1 ) = 2α11 r > 0 and x100 (α1 ) = − 2α12 r < 0, and therefore that x1 (α1 ) is concave.

When γ = 1, the CRRA value of spending function reduces to a log value of spending function

v( x ) = ln( x ). In this case, the first order condition is αx11 = B− x21 , and the period 1 spending function

function is also concave.

The quadratic value of spending function is defined by v( x ) = x − bx2 with 0 < b < 2B
so that the value is increasing and concave over the feasible range of spending, x1 ∈ [0, B]. The
first order condition is α1 (1 − bx1 ) = E[α2 ] (1 − 2b( B − x1 )) and yields the period 1 spending
α +E[α2 ](2bB−1)
function x1 (α1 ) = 1 2b(α +
. Let us assume that the support of α1 is bounded such the
1 E[ α2 ])
agency never finds it optimal to be at a corner solution in the first period. The first derivative
E[α ](1−bB)
1
is x1 (α1 ) = b(α 2+E[α ])2 > 0, which is positive because 0 < b < 2B
. The second derivative is

< 0, which is negative due to the same condition. Therefore, we have
shown that x1 (α1 ) is increasing and concave.
In the general case with an arbitrary concave value of spending function v( x ), the first order

condition is α1 v0 ( x1 ) = E[α2 ]v0 ( B − x1 ). By the Implicit Function Theorem, x10 (α1 ) =
0. Differentiating yields

x100 (α1 ) =

− v 0 ( x1 )
α1 v00 ( x1 )+E[α2 ]v00 ( B− x1 )

α1 v000 ( x1 ) − E[α2 ]v000 ( B − x1 )

v 0 ( x1 )
α1 v00 ( x1 ) + E[α2 ]v00 ( B − x1 )

The left hand side is twice the coefficient of absolute risk aversion and is strictly greater than zero.
The condition trivially holds if v000 ( x ) = 0 and more generally holds if v000 ( x ) is small relative to
the level of absolute risk aversion.

A.2

Proposition 2

We first show that spending-weighted average quality, Ew(α) [qm ], can be alternatively expressed as
the unweighted expected value of spending divided by the unweighted expected level of spending, E[αm v( xm )]/E[ xm ]. In particular, the spending-weighted expectation of quality is given by
R
α v( x )
x (α)
Ew(α) [qm ] = qm (α)w(α)dFα where quality is qm (α) = m xm m and the weight is w(α) = R x(α)dF .

To show that there is a drop-off in average quality, first suppose, contrary to the fact, that the
agency does not know its period 1 value of spending parameter α1 when it makes its period 1
spending decision x1 . If this is the case, then x1 = x2 = B/2 with expected quality in both periods
ᾱv( B/2)
equal to
.
B/2
Now suppose that α1 is observed prior to the period 1 spending decision as specified in the
model. We will show that observing α1 (i) increases total quality on average across both periods
and (ii) decreases quality on average in period 2. Since total quality equals quality in period 1
plus quality in period 2, this implies that observing α1 increases period 1 quality. A rise in period
1 quality and drop-off in period 2 quality, relative to the case where quality is equal, implies that
quality in period 1 is higher than quality in period 2.
We first show that total quality on average strictly increases when α1 is observed. To see this,
rewrite the period 1 objective for the agency as
V (α1 , θ ) = max
x1

θ (α1 − E[α1 ])v( x1 ) + E[α1 ]v( x1 ) + ᾱv( B − x1 ).

47

>

The parameter θ takes on values on the closed unit interval θ ∈ [0, 1] and allows us to
smoothly interpolate between the objective function where the agency does not observe α1 (which
is captured by θ = 0) and the objective where the agency observes α1 (which is captured by
∂V
θ = 1). From the envelope theorem, we know
= (α1 − E[α1 ])v( x1 (α)). Assuming the stan∂θ
∂
dard conditions that permit the interchange of integration and differentiation,
Eα [V (α1 , θ )] =
∂θ 1
Eα1 [(α1 − ᾱ)v( x1 (α1 ))]. By the concavity of v(·) and Jensen’s inequality, we know that Eα1 [(α1 −
∂
E[α1 ])v( x1 (α1 ))] > 0 and therefore
Eα [V (α1 , θ )] > 0 or that total quality over both periods is
∂θ 1
higher on average when α1 is observed.
We next show that observing α1 leads to a strict decrease in average period 2 quality. To see
this, notice that observing α1 has two effects on period 2 spending x2 (α1 ) = B − x1 (α1 ). First, from
Proposition 1 we know that the average level of spending increases: E[ x2 (α1 )] > B/2. Second, we
know that for any non-degenerate distribution, observing α1 leads to a mean preserving spread
in spending around E[ x2 (α1 )]. Because of the concavity of v(·), increasingthe average level
 of
Eα2 α2 v(Eα1 [ x2 (α1 )]
<
period 2 spending reduces the average quality of period 2 spending:
Eα1 [ x2 (α1 )]
E[αt v( B/2)]
. By the concavity of v(·) and second-order stochastic dominance, a mean-preserving
E[ B/2]
Eα2 [α2 v( x2 (α1 )]
<
spread in x2 (α1 ) around E[ x2 (α1 )] leads to a further drop in average period 2 quality:
Eα1 [ x2 (α1 )]


Eα2 α2 v(Eα1 [ x2 (α1 )]
.
Eα1 [ x2 (α1 )]
So we have shown that observing α1 leads to an increase in total quality over both periods and
a drop in period 2 quality relative to the case where quality is equal on average in both periods.
This implies that period 1 quality increases relative to the case where quality is equal on average in
both periods. It then follows that average quality is higher in period 1 than in period 2 or q̄1 > q̄2 .

Since Congress and the agency place the same value on spending (ignoring the cost of funds), we

will decrease the agency’s budget one-for-one to offset any rolled over funding. Since the agency
values spending, the agency can increase its objective by exhausting all of its budget authority and
not rolling over any resources.

A.4

Proposition 4

To show that full rollover is optimal, we will show that for any budget rule that does not have full
rollover, there exists a full rollover budget with the same expected costs and a higher expected
value of spending. This implies that the optimal budget rule must have full rollover.
Consider any budget rule that does not allow for full rollover By∗ = Γ( Ay−1,M − xy−1,m ) 6= B̄.

To show that the value of spending is higher in the full rollover scenario, consider the firstorder conditions for the agency. With full rollover, the objective for the agency is identical to the
objective for Congress. With incomplete rollover, the agency is distorted away from the optimal
spending path for Congress and therefore produces a lower value of spending.
Thus we have shown that for any non-rollover budget rule, there exists a policy rule with
full rollover that has the same costs but higher value of spending for Congress, implying that full
rollover is optimal.

B

The Impact of Appropriations Timing on the Within-Year Pattern of
Government Procurement Spending

It is the exception rather than the rule for Congress to pass annual appropriations bills before the
beginning of the fiscal year. Between 2000 and 2009, the full annual appropriations process was
never completed on time. Although defense appropriations bills were enacted before the start of
the fiscal year four times, in eight of the ten years, appropriations for all or nearly all of the civilian
agencies were enacted in a single consolidated appropriations act well after the start of the fiscal
year.
Analysts have attributed some of the challenges facing federal acquisition to the tardiness of
the appropriations process, since these delays introduce uncertainty and compress the time available to plan and implement a successful acquisition strategy (Acquisition Advisory Panel, 2007).
In this subsection we analyze the relationship between the timing of the annual appropriations
acts and the within-year pattern of government contract spending. For this analysis, we use the
full 2000 to 2009 FPDS data, even though the data prior to 2004 are of lower quality. Apparently, in
these earlier years, some contracts were all assigned dates in the middle of the month. Therefore,
the within-month weekly pattern of spending is not fully available.
Appendix Figure A1 shows results from regressing measures of end-of-year spending on the
timing of annual appropriations. This analysis has two data points for each year, one representing defense spending and the other representing non-defense spending. For each observation, we
measure the share of annual contract spending occurring in the last quarter, month, and week of
the year and the “weeks late” of the enactment of annual appropriations legislation.48 “Weeks
48 Enactment

is defined by the date the President signs the legislation.

49

late” measures time relative to October 1 and takes on negative values when appropriations were
enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. For defense spending, “weeks late” measures the date
that the defense appropriations bill was enacted. For non-defense spending, the date is assigned
from the date of the consolidated appropriations act, or, in the case of the two years in which there
was not a consolidated act, a date that is the midpoint of the individual non-defense appropriations acts.49
There is a clear pattern in the data in which later appropriation dates result in a greater fraction
of government spending occurring at the end of the year. In the plots, we show the separate slopes
of the defense and non-defense observations. Defense spending tends to be appropriated earlier
and to have less end-of-year spending, but the slopes for the two types of spending are similar.
The labels show the regression coefficients, including the coefficients from a pooled regression in
which defense and non-defense spending have different intercepts but are constrained to have
the same slope. The estimates show that a delay of ten weeks—roughly the average over this
time period—raises the share of spending in the last quarter by 2 percentage points from a base of
about 27 percent. A ten-week delay raises the share of spending in the last month by 1 percentage
point, from a base of about 15 percent. Both coefficients are statistically significant at the 1 percent
level. As we mentioned above, we do not have reliable within-month data on timing for the years
prior to 2004, so we exclude the pre-2004 years for the analysis of spending during the last week
of the year. The estimates indicate that a 10-week delay raises the share of spending occurring in
the last week of the year by 1 percentage point on a base of 9 percent. Due to the smaller sample,
the estimate is less precise, with a p-value of 0.07.50

C

Calibrating the Welfare Gains

This section describes the procedure we use to estimate the welfare gains from rollover and discusses the results in more detail. To estimate the welfare gains, we first calibrate the model to
fit the spike in spending and drop-off in quality under the status quo in which rollover is not allowed. Given the calibrated parameters, we then simulate the pattern of spending when rollover
is permitted using value function iteration. A comparison of welfare under these regimes gives us
the welfare gain from rollover and from alternative counterfactual policies.

C.1

Target Moments

The calibrated infinite horizon model is characterized by a parameter that determines the curvature of the value of spending function and a parameter that determines the distribution of spending shocks. We calibrate these parameters such that simulated data from the model has the same
spike in spending and drop-off in quality that we observed in the federal procurement data.
Spike in spending. We define the spike in spending as the ratio of last month spending to
average monthly spending over the rest of the year. This ratio is 2.18 in the pooled 2004 to 2009
FPDS.
Drop-off in quality. We calibrate the drop-off in quality by matching the coefficient on last
month from an ordered logit regression in the I.T. Dashboard data and the coefficient on last month
49 We aggregate all non-defense spending to facilitate communication of the pattern of results while capturing nearly
all of the available variation. We have also conducted analyses in which we assign each non-defense agency the date of
its individual appropriations act and obtain very similar results.
50 When appropriations bills are delayed beyond the start of a fiscal year, the government operates under a continuing
resolution that typically maintains spending at the levels set for the prior fiscal year. When a new budget is passed, any
changes in the budget level are prorated to account for the shorter year.

50

from an analogous regression in simulated data from the model.51
Recall from Section 2 that the quality of spending in a given month is defined as the value of
spending per dollar of expenditure: qm = αm v( xm )/xm . The logistic regression estimates of the
drop-off in quality are based on the assumption that quality is determined by the data generating
process
qm = β q Last_monthm + σq em
where Last_month is an indicator for the last month of the year and the error term is the product
of a type-I extreme value random variable e and scale factor σq > 0.
In the I.T. Dashboard data, we do not observe this underlying quality variable but instead
observe a categorical overall rating variable, which we assume is an index of underlying quality.
Because our outcome variable is categorical, we can recover an estimate of β q /σq with an ordered
logit regression of overall rating on the Last_month indicator and controls.52 In the simulated data
from the model we observe quality directly. We recover β q /σq in these data with a straightforward
logistic regression of quality on the Last_month indicator variable.
Appendix Table A11 shows odds ratios of the coefficient on last month from ordered logit
regressions in the I.T. Dashboard data. In our preferred specification, which includes year, agency,
and project characteristic covariates, projects that are originated in the last month of the year have
0.42 odds of having a higher quality score. We calibrate the model so that the drop-off is the same
in the simulated data from the model.

C.2

Calibrating the Model

We match these two moments by calibrating the model’s two parameters: σ and γ. Specifically, we
assume that the uncertainty shocks, α, are drawn from a log-normal distribution, ln α ∼ N (0, σ),
parameterized by a standard deviation parameter, σ, and the value of spending function, v( xm ; γ),
is parameterized by a curvature parameter, γ. Let θ ≡ {σ, γ} denote the parameters of the model.
We calibrate θ and calculate welfare in the no-rollover regime in the following manner:
• Step 1. For a given θ, we calculate the value VmNR ( A, θ ) to the agency from having A assets
in month m by backward induction, numerically integrating over the distribution of α.
• Step 2. For a given initial budget B and θ, we simulate forward a pattern of spending using
the estimated VmNR ( A, θ ) from Step 1.
• Step 3. For each B, we find the θ that matches the spike in spending and drop-off in quality
moments using a quadratic loss function. The objective is convex with a unique minimum
value. Label these values θ ( B).
• Step 4. We search over the domain of B and associated θ ( B) to find the budget that maximizes welfare for Congress net the social cost of funds. Label this budget B NR .
The parameters B NR and θ ( B NR ) uniquely determine the value of spending, cost of spending, and
welfare when rollover is not permitted.
51 The

approach of matching regression coefficients in actual and simulated data is sometimes referred to as indirect
inference (Gourieroux, Monfort and Renault, 1993). See Voena (2012) for a recent application of this technique.
52 Coefficients in a logistic regression model are identified up to the scale factor σ . See Train (2003) for an in-depth
q
discussion of this issue.

C.3

Model Fit
1− γ

In our baseline calibration, we specify a CRRA, v( x ) = x1−γ , value of spending function with
curvature parameter γ. We conduct robustness checks to examine the sensitivity of our results
to a CARA functional form. We set the number of months per year to M = 12 and the monthly
discount factor to β = 0.996.53 We normalize the social cost of funds to λ = 1.
Panel A of Appendix Table A12 shows the target and calibrated moments. The ratio of last
month to rest-of-year spending is 2.18 in the pooled 2004 to 2009 FPDS. The odds that a project
started in the last month of the year has a higher quality score is 0.42 in the I.T. Dashboard data.54
The moments calculated from the simulated data are very similar. Panel B shows the underlying
parameter estimates of γ and σ from the model.55
Appendix Figure A2 examines how the model fits the monthly pattern of spending. Panel A
plots the percent of spending each month in the pooled 2004 to 2009 FPDS and simulated data
from the model with a CRRA value of spending function. Recall that the model is calibrated
to the ratio of last month to rest-of-year average monthly spending but not to the shape of this
increase by month. Nevertheless, the CRRA model does a good job matching the flat profile of
spending over the first part of the year and the sharp spike at year’s end.56 The simulated data
from the CARA specification, shown in Panel B, also match the pattern of spending over the year.
Because the CARA specification does not capture the sharp uptick in spending between August
and September as well as the CRRA function form, we choose CRRA as our preferred specification.
Calibrating the model is computationally intensive. Relative to a standard stochastic, dynamic
programing problem, our application is complicated by two factors. The first is that because our
value function varies by calendar month, we need to estimate M value functions. The second is
that our model has two optimizing agents. At the beginning of each year, Congress decides on
a budget for the agency, taking agency behavior as given. At the beginning of each month, the
agency chooses its level of spending, taking Congress’s behavior as given. We account for this in
the calibrations by estimating how the agency would behave over a grid of possible budget values
B > 0 and then searching over this grid to find the budget B∗ that maximizes Congress’s objective. To speed computation, the calibrations were performed using 12 cores in parallel, running
continuously for approximately one week.

C.4

Welfare with Rollover

We assess the welfare gains from rollover by comparing the non-rollover status quo to three counterfactuals. The first is the compensating variation from rollover, defined as the reduction in budget authority that allows for the same expected value of spending as in the no-rollover regime. The
second is the welfare gain from rollover when Congress can re-optimize the budget it provides to
the agency. The third counterfactual is the welfare gain from the first-best level of spending, defined as the level of spending in each period that equates the marginal social value of spending to
the marginal social cost of funds. Compared to rollover which effectively allows agencies to save,
53 This

monthly discount factor implies an annual discount factor of 0.95 = 0.99612 .
estimate is from an ordered logit specification of overall rating on last month and a full set of controls with the
observations weighted by spending. Appendix Table A11 shows alternative specifications of this model.
55 We are identified because we have two parameters and two moments. If we calibrated the model using only the
spike in spending, we would be unable to separately identify the parameters because a large spike could arise from
little curvature in the value of spending function and substantial variance in the α’s or from substantial curvature in
the value of spending function and little variance in the α’s.
56 The model naturally under-predicts spending in October and March because it does not separately account for
spending on items like building leases that reset on an annual or semi-annual basis.
54 The

52

the first-best effectively allows agencies both to save and to borrow. The welfare gains from this
counterfactual are an upper bound because agencies can acquire extra resources in extenuating
circumstances through mid-year supplemental appropriations from Congress.
The value to the agency VmR ( A) in the rollover regime from having assets A in month m is
calculated by value function iteration. Let superscripts index iterations of the value function. The
algorithm for updating the value function is

h
i
 maxx αv( x ) + βEα V j ( A − x )
if m < M
j +1
i
h m +1
Vm ( A) =
 maxx αv( x ) + βEα V j ( B + A − x ) if m = M
1
Notice that this is mathematically identical to iteration on a single composite value function
h
i
Ṽ j+1 (S) = max αv( x ) + βEα Ṽ j g(S, x )
x

where the month index is subsumed into the state variable S = { A, m} and the function g(S, x )
governs the evolution of months and assets. As such, the existence and uniqueness of the solution
follows directly from the standard conditions that v(·) is concave, the constraint set generated by
g(S, x ) is convex and compact, and there is discounting β < 1 (Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2004).
We calculate welfare in the regime with rollover in the following steps:
• Step 1. For a given initial budget B and θ ( B NR ) from the within-year calibrations, we estimate the value function VmR ( A) for each month m = 1 . . . M by value function iteration.
• Step 2. For this budget, the present value of spending to the agency is the beginning of year
value function evaluated at this budget allocation V1 ( B), the net present cost of spending is
the discounted sum of annual budgets B, and welfare is the difference in these values.
• Step 3. We search over the domain of B to find the value that maximizes welfare. Label this
value as B R for budget with rollover.
The parameter B R determines the value of spending, cost of spending, and welfare with rollover
Appendix Table A13 shows the welfare gains from the three counterfactual scenarios. The first
column shows the percent change in the value of spending; the second column shows the percent
change in the social cost of spending (the amount of spending times λ); and the third column
shows the difference between the first two columns, which gives the percent change in overall
social surplus. Values are scaled by the social cost of spending under the no-rollover status quo.
With the preferred CRRA specification, the compensating variation from rollover is 13 percent of
the social cost of spending. That is, Congress could allow rollover, reduce the agency’s budget by
13 percent, and the value of spending would be identical to the status quo.
Allowing for full Congressional re-optimization leads to slightly higher welfare gains. Spending levels (social cost) are lower than in the no rollover case. This is the result of two offsetting
effects. Because agencies on average enter the year with rolled-over funds, Congress does not
need to provide as much funding to ensure that the agency can take advantage of high α periods.
On the other hand, Congress is more willing to provide funds given that agencies will not squander them on projects with a value below the social cost of funds. The total value of spending is
slightly lower than in the no-rollover scenario with the CRRA specification and slightly higher
with the CARA functional form.

53

The final scenario shows the first-best in which the agency does all spending that exceeds the
social value of funds and no spending that is below. Comparing the rollover scenarios to the firstbest scenario we see that rollover allows the government to capture two-thirds of the benefits of
moving from no-rollover to the first-best.

C.5

Intermediate Policies

Whether these welfare gains can be achieved depends on Congress’s ability to commit to future
budgets. While Congress cannot completely tie its own hands, it can design policy to increase the
likelihood of commitment. For example, Congress could specify that rolled over amounts are not
reported in standard budget tables, increasing the cost of obtaining this information. Similarly,
Congress could allow agencies to roll over funding for a time-limited grace period.57 Such a grace
period would not simply result in a spike in spending at the new deadline. Because next year’s
budget authority would provide a de facto rainy day fund, even a few months of rollover would
allow agencies to draw down their previous year’s savings over a longer time period.58 Finally,
Congress could provide more funding on a multi-year basis. While the full implications of less
frequent fiscal policy are outside the scope of this paper, one benefit of multi-year budgeting is that
it reduces the frequency of wasteful year-end spending. Below we first describe how we simulate
the welfare gains from these intermediate policies and then present our results.
Partial commitment. Suppose that Congress can only commitment to allowing rollover with
commonly known probability π. Simulating welfare under this regime requires two modifications
to the algorithm described above:
h
i
• The period M continuation value is replaced by Eα πV1 ( B + A − x ) + (1 − π )V1 ( B) , the
average of the no-rollover and with-rollover continuation values weighted by their probabilities.
• For each B, the cost of spending is decreased by the expected level of reclaimed funds. This
value is calculated by simulating forward a pattern of spending using the estimated value
functions. The expected level of reclaimed funds is discounted to account for the fact that
the budget authority is reclaimed a year after it is authorized.
Partial rollover. Suppose that agencies can roll over budget authority for no more than m̄
months. Since we assume that budget authority is fungible, this policy constrains period m̄ + 1
budget authority to be no greater than the annual budget B. To simulate welfare under this regime,
we make the following modification to the algorithm described above:
h
i
• The continuation value is replaced with Eα Vm (min{ B + A − x, B}) in periods m > m̄.
Since the agency never rolls over more than B into period m̄ + 1, we do not need to account for
reclaimed funds in our calculation of the cost of spending.
Multiyear budgeting. Suppose that budgets are provided on a multiyear basis. There is
no rollover across budget cycles, but there is full rollover across years when there is not a new
57 We

thank Dan Feenberg for suggesting this counterfactual.

58 Because Congress rarely passes a budget on schedule and agencies are operating under continuing resolutions, this

partial rollover period often will have expired by the time that a new budget is determined. In this case, Congress
would have no incentive to take this rolled over amount into consideration.

54

budget. We simulate welfare under this policy regime with the backwards induction algorithm
used to calibrate the model with one modification:
• The number of periods is increased to k × M, where k is the number of years per budget
cycle. The monthly discount factor β is unaltered.
Appendix Figure A3 examines the welfare gains from these intermediate policies. In each
plot, the y-axis shows the welfare gain as a percent of the welfare gain from full rollover. Each
point in each plot is calculated from an independent simulation of the baseline model. Panel A
examines the implications of imperfect Congressional commitment. With probability π, Congress
commits and agencies are able to roll over the full amount of unspent resources into the next year.
With probability 1 − π, Congress reneges and unspent resources are taken from the agency and
valued in the welfare function at the social cost of funds. Both the agency and Congress know this
probability π and optimize accordingly. The plot shows that small commitment probabilities can
achieve relatively large welfare gains. For example, a 25 percent commitment probability leads to
welfare gains of more than half the full rollover value, as agencies prefer to roll over their funds
than engage in flat-of-the-curve spending at the end of the year.59
Panel B of Appendix Figure A3 examines the welfare gains from time-limited grace periods,
in which agencies are allowed to roll over unused funding for m̄ periods of the next year. Since
we assume that budget authority is fungible within an agency, this policy constrains the agency’s
period m̄ + 1 budget to be no greater than their beginning-of-year budget allocation B. As before, a
small amount of rollover can generate large welfare gains. A one-month grace period achieves 41
percent of the welfare gains from full rollover; a two-month grace period achieves 66 percent; and
a four-month grace period 90 percent. Panel C shows the welfare gains from multi-year budgets.
Two-year budget cycles achieve 70 percent of the gains from full rollover; three-year budget cycles
achieve 90 percent.
In summary, the results indicate that allowing for rollover can lead to economically meaningful gains in welfare. If Congress can fully commit, the welfare gains from rollover are over
10 percent of the social cost of funds. Even if Congress can commit with a modest probability or
provide a short grace period, welfare gains of more than 5 percent could be achieved.

59 The plot is S-shaped because the value of spending is convex in the commitment probability while the amount of
reclaimed funds is concave. It is the sum of a convex and concave function which gives the plot its shape.

Note: Vertical axes show the percent of annual spending occurring in the last quarter, month, and week of
the fiscal year. Horizontal axes show the passage dates for the non-defense and defense appropriation
bills, relative to the first day of the fiscal year in weeks. For defense spending, weeks late measures the
date that the defense appropriations bill was enacted. For non-defense spending, the date is assigned from
the date of the consolidated appropriations act, or, in the case of the two years in which there was not a

Note: Planned total cost is inflation-adjusted to 2009 dollars using the CPI-U. Overall rating is a quality
index that combines that CIO evaluation, cost rating, and scheduling rating subindexes (see text for
details). It takes values from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best score. The CIO evaluation is the agency CIO’s
assessment of project quality. It takes values from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best. The cost rating is based on
the absolute percent deviation between the planned and actual cost of the project. The cost overrun is a
non-absolute measure that assigns over-cost projects the lowest scores. The schedule rating is based on the
average tardiness of the project. The cost and schedule indices take values from 0 to 10, with 10 being the
best. The line of business “other” category combines all categories with 4 or fewer projects.

contracts originated during the last week of the year and during earlier weeks in the year. Columns 3 and
4 show the standard deviations of the overall rating quality index from the I.T. Dashboard data for
contracts originated during the last week of the year and during earlier weeks in the year. Columns 1 and
3 show the standard deviations in the raw data. Columns 2 and 4 show these standard deviations after
partialling out fixed effects. The percent of spending statistics are calculated using observations that are
the percentage of spending by agency and by week in each year. The fixed effects are for agency and year.
In constructing the agency-week-year observations for the I.T. Dashboard data set, the individual project
data is weighted by spending on each project so that the standard deviations can by interpreted as the
variation per dollar of expenditure. The residual analysis for the I.T. Dashboard data partials out agency,
year, and product characteristics fixed effects. Project characteristics are fixed effects for investment phase,
service group, and line of business (see Appendix Table A4).

Panel B: Parameters

Source: I.T. Dashboard data, accessed March, 2010 via http://it.usaspending.gov. Federal Procurement
Data System, accessed October, 2010 via www.usaspending.gov.
Note: Panel A shows target and calibrated moments for the spike in spending and the drop-off in quality.
The target spike is calculated as the ratio of last monthly to rest-of-year average month spending in the
pooled 2004 to 2009 FPDS. The target drop off is the odds ratio of a high quality score from an order logit
regression of overall rating on last week and controls in the I.T. Dashboard data. The specification is also
shown in column 4 of Appendix Table A11.

No Rollover

Note: Welfare gains from rollover from the calibrated model with CRRA and CARA value-of-spending
functions. Compensating variation is the reduction in budget authority that could be provided to the
agency with rollover to achieve the same expected value of spending as in the no-rollover regime. Full
Congressional reoptimization allows Congress to adjust the budget for the agency. First best is the level of
spending that equates the marginal value of spending to the marginal social cost in each sub-year period.
The first column shows the percent change in the value of spending, the second column shows the percent
change in the social cost of spending, and the third column shows the percent change in social surplus. All
values are normalized by the social cost of spending under the no-rollover status quo. See Appendix C for
details.
