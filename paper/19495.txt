ABSTRACT
We combine survey data on British and German immigrants in the US with data on natives in Britain
and Germany to estimate the causal effect of migration on educational mobility through cross-national
marriage. To control for selective mating, we instrument educational attainment using government
spending on education in the years each person was of school-age. To control for selective migration,
we instrument the migration decision using inflows of immigrants to the US during puberty and early
adulthood. We find that migration causes men to marry up and women to marry down, but self-selection
into migration and marriage dampens down these effects.

1 Introduction
The decisions to marry and to migrate aect a wide range of outcomes of scientic and policy
interest, such as income inequality, female labor supply, the number of births and population
growth, and the distribution of family resources. In the extensive and largely independent economics literatures that study marriage and migration, researchers recognize that both decisions
involve high degrees of self-selection based on a range of characteristics and, depending on this
selectivity, they may have diverse eects on the decision-makers. An important drawback of
the literature is that it examines marriage and migration independently, it does not account for
the interplay between the two and, therefore, it fails to accurately identify their causal eect on
socio-economic outcomes. To contribute evidence on this issue, we take education as a proxy
of social status and economic well-being and we ask whether a migrant is more likely to marry
a spouse of higher education than he would have if he had not migrated.
Migration research in economics treats the decision to migrate as an investment that depends
on earnings dierentials across countries net of migration costs (Sjaastad 1962). By comparing
emigrants to non-migrants in the home country pre-migration, researchers have shown that this
decision process produces migrants with select skills and characteristics (Chiquiar and Hanson
2005, Ibarraran and Lubotsky 2007, McKenzie and Rapaport 2010, FernÃ¡ndez-Huertas Moraga
2011). In combination with the causal eects of migration, this selectivity entails dierential
socio-economic trajectories for migrants relative to the population in both the origin and destination countries.

Empirical studies, however, rarely compare the post-migration outcomes

of migrants with outcomes of compatriots who did not migrate (e.g.
and Eriksson 2012).

Abramitzky, Boustan,

Instead, studies typically compare migrants' outcomes to those of the

native-born individuals or other co-ethnics who previously migrated to the host country. These
studies test the extent to which migrants integrate into the host society or whether children
of migrants are more or less upwardly mobile than children of natives. Much of this research
relies on US data (Borjas 1993, 1995, 1996, 2002, Card 2005), although more recent studies
have also used data from Australia (Chiswick, Lee and Miller 2005), Europe (Dustman, Glitz,
and Vogel 2010, Dustman and Theodoropoulos 2010) and Canada (Aydemir, Chen, and Corak

2

2009). Depending on the nature of migrant selectivity, these studies estimate mixed eects of
migration on migrants' economic status.
Marriage research in economics originates from the work of Becker (1974), who predicted
that individuals can gain higher social or economic status through marital sorting, depending on
whether mobility is measured on the basis of characteristics that are complements or substitutes
in household production.

For example, Becker argues that women are more likely to marry-

up in terms of wages relative to men because men tend to specialize in market production
and choose to marry women who specialize in home production (negative assortative mating).
In contrast, marital mobility in terms of education is uncertain, since education encompasses
characteristics that are both complements and substitutes in household production.

In his

extension of Becker's model, Lam (1988) argues that assortative mating (or homogamy) with
respect to wages depends on two dierent osetting forces. On the one hand, there are returns
to specialization in household production which generates a tendency for negative assortative
mating. On the other hand, joint consumption of household public goods generates a tendency
for positive assortative mating because there are returns to spouses having similar demand for
these public goods.

Empirical studies generally nd positive assortative mating on the basis

of education but, consistent with Lam's prediction, there is mixed empirical support for the
hypothesis of negative assortative mating on the basis of wages (Zimmer 1996; Nakosteen and
Zimmer 2001; Zang and Liu 2003; Nakosteen, Westerlund, and Zimmer 2004). Irrespective of its
direction, assortative mating is important not only because it determines the economic mobility
of the spouses but also because its eect extends to their ospring (Chadwick and Solon 2002;
Ermisch et al. 2006).
Of course, researchers have long recognized that individuals may take the decisions to migrate
and marry jointly. For example, studies in sociology have observed that women from developing
countries often migrate to richer countries with a bigger supply of `good' potential spouses in
order to marry men living there (Constable 2004; Kim 2009), including compatriot men who
had previously migrated (Lievens 1999). Others examine whether migrants marry natives after
they arrive to assimilate more rapidly in the culture and society of their host country (Qian and

3

Lichter 1991; Sassler 2005). Finally, a dierent set of studies discuss whether people, especially
women, marry a foreigner while still in their home country to make it easier to move to another
country - either because that country oers better labor market opportunities or because it oers
other benets such as better human rights (Watts 1983; Ortiz 1996; Piper 1999). More recently,
economic research has examined whether migrants dier from natives on how they select their
spouses.

Celikaksoy et al.

(2006) nd that immigrants assort positively on education, even

when they `import' their spouses from their country of origin.

Furtado and Theodoropoulos

(2011) nd that matching on education rather than ethnicity is more important for natives and
those immigrants who arrived as young children, especially whites. Furtado (2012) focuses on
second generation immigrants and shows that, when the distribution of educational attainment
diers by ethnicity, individuals trade similarities in ethnicity for similarities in education when
choosing spouses. Lafortune (2013) delves even deeper and shows that migrants who are forward
looking will invest in education depending on their expectations of the marriage market in the
host country.
Albeit insightful, the above studies suer several shortcomings.

First, because they fail

to formally address either marital selectivity or immigrant selectivity or both, they cannot
identify the separate eects of the two decisions on the outcomes of interest. Second, because
they typically rely on cross-sectional data who are limited to people who are currently married,
they cannot determine whether people invested in education after they married so that their
education levels converged even when they were uncorrelated before marriage. Such behavior
might plausibly occur if having a partner makes it easier to nance education or if a partner
shares information about educational opportunities. Finally, because the studies only use data
from the country to which people moved, their evidence sheds no light on what is arguably the
most interesting counterfactual question - whether and to what degree would marital sorting
dier had immigrants never left their home country.
In this paper, we aim to identify the causal eect of migration on marital mobility in terms
of educational attainment. We combine survey data from Germany and the UK with survey
data on German and British immigrants from the US. With these data we compare educational

4

mobility through marriage among couples of natives living in the UK and Germany and couples
living in the US where one partner is a British or German immigrant and the other partner is a
US native. We estimate the probability that a migrant marries someone with more education,
correcting for both migration and spouse selectivity. To purge the eect of marital sorting, we
instrument for attained education using temporal variation in government spending on total
education during the years each person was of school-age. By doing this, we avoid counting as
marital mobility any correlation between the education of partners that arises because of how
people select a spouse or the correlation that is the consequence of post-marriage educational
attainment. To purge the eect of selective migration, we instrument the migration decision
using variation in the number of British and German citizens who migrated to the US during
the years each person was in puberty and early adulthood. These migrant inows serve as a
proxy for the extent of migration networks available to people who are deciding whether or not
to move. Our identifying assumption is that higher migration ows lower the cost of migration
but do not aect the probability of marrying a more educated US native.
At the observational level, marital mobility on the basis of education is roughly the same
between migrant and non-migrant men, and it is somewhat higher for migrant women relative to
non-migrants, especially Germans. However, when we control for marital and migration selectivity, mobility is higher for immigrant men than non-migrant men, and it is lower for migrant
women than non-migrant women. Our analysis suggests that these patterns arise because selectivity diers by sex and migration status. First, we nd that unobserved characteristics related
to marital appeal favor migrant women and disfavor migrant men relative to their non-migrant
counterparts. These results are consistent with Becker's prediction that men specialize in market production and women specialize in home production, assuming that this specialization
generates equivalent specialization in mating strategies (i.e. men value non-marketable spousal
traits and women value marketable traits).

Second, we nd that unobserved characteristics

related to the migration decision decrease the probability of marrying up for migrants relative
to their non-migrant counterparts. This result suggests that migrants exchange the education
of their US spouses for other benets, e.g. they may select to marry-down as a means to gain

5

entry to the US. Finally, the causal eect of migration on mobility is consistent with the higher
availability of educated spouses in the US than in the UK and Germany, and with the fact that
British and German women marry later in life relative to their US competitors.
The paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents the data and some descriptive statistics,
section 3 discusses the empirical strategy, and section 4 presents and discusses the results. A
nal section concludes the paper.

2 The Data
We draw data from the 1994-2010 monthly waves of Current Population S urveys (CPS); from
the 1994-2008 waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS); and from the 1994-2009
waves of the version of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) produced for the Cross
National Equivalent File (Frick et al. 2007). Since 1994 the CPS asks all respondents where
they were born and when they arrived in the US, which allow us to identify rst-generation
immigrants from Germany and the UK. All surveys ask respondents about their level of education, their socioeconomic characteristics (age, sex, race), and their relationship with other
household members. Before we conduct any analysis with these data, we examine whether the
probability of ever getting married diers by country and migration status. As Table 1 shows,
we nd that dierences are small and in line with the constancy of the marriage probability

1

worldwide

and the classication of marriage as a cultural universal (Brown 1991).

We pool data from all monthly CPS surveys and keep records for couples of rst-generation
immigrants and US natives. We combine the CPS data with comparable data from all BHPS
and SOEP couples who are both native-born. We exclude from our sample anyone who migrated
before age 18 to reduce the chance that a person migrated not because he chose to do so but
because his parents chose to migrate. We also exclude individuals surveyed when they were 21
or younger because our primary focus is on educational mobility and we want to reduce the

1 Using data from the Demographic Yearbooks of the United Nations on 97 industrial and agricultural countries societies, Fisher (1989) reports that between 1972 and 1981, 93.1% of women and 91.8% of men were
married by age 49.

probability that a person was still in school.
The CPS data do not include information on when couples married. Consequently, we cannot
dierentiate between immigrants who married before they came to the US and immigrants who
married after they arrived.

We do know, however, where each partner was born and where

each partner's parents were born. Thus, we can restrict our immigrant sample to include only
rst-generation immigrants from the UK or Germany who are married to a US native (i.e. a
US-born individual whose parents were also born in the US or in a country other than the UK
or Germany). We exclude other types of immigrants (e.g. those married to a rst- or secondgeneration compatriot immigrant, or an immigrant from a dierent country) mostly because
the size of those samples are small.

2

We also exclude these immigrants because they likely

took their migration decisions as a couple rather than as individuals. To model the educational
mobility of such couples requires a complex model of the migration decision which would allow
the migration of immigrant husbands and wives to be simultaneously determined. Of course,
it is also possible for British and German migrants to have married US natives before they
arrived in the US, as is the case of women who met and married U.S. servicemen stationed in
their home-country during and after World War II and entered the US as War Brides.

3

In the

following section, we explain that our identication method addresses the potential bias that
this source of endogeneity might cause.
Table 2 describes the demographic characteristics of couples by sex and migration status and
reports sample sizes. The data show that the distribution of education of husbands is broadly

2 Among all British and German migrants in our sample, about 68% are married to US natives, 31% are
married to compatriots, and less than 1% are married to migrants from other countries.

3 It is estimated that approximately 115,000 immigrants entered the US under the provisions of the War

Brides Act of 1945; the Alien Fiancees and Fiances Act of 1946; and the Soldier Brides Acts of 1946 and 1947
(INSUS 1950). These brides entered the country within a narrow time window (in the decade following the end
of WWII) and belonged to a narrow birth cohort. Based on a small survey of British war brides conducted in
1989, the average age of the brides at the time of marriage was twenty-three and the age of their US husbands
was twenty-ve (Virden 1996). These characteristics allow us to estimate an upper bound of the share of War
Brides in our data. Migrant women who arrived in the US between 1945 and 1955 and were younger than 36 at
the time of arrival comprise 15.8% of the total British females and 21.6% of the German females. More recent
data from the UK International Passenger Survey (IPS) indicates that, on average between 1982 and 2012, only
twenty-ve percent of British citizens leaving the UK between 1982 and 2012 said they were doing so primarily
to join or accompany their family or (co-ethnic or other) partner.

Most of them said that they migrated to

work. While the IPS does not report primary reasons by country of destination, the relative strength of the US
economy suggests that UK immigrants probably come to the US to work. The same logic applies to immigrants
from Germany.

similar to the distribution of education of wives, thus hinting the potential for marital sorting.
The data also show that migrants and their American spouses are generally more educated than
natives still living in the home country, suggesting that migrants are a more selected sample of
their native population in terms of education.
As noted above, to correct educational mobility for marital selection we rely on variation in
public spending on education during the years each person was of primary and secondary school
age.

4

We collect data on the amount local, state, and federal governments spent on education at

all levels as a percentage of GDP from Chantrill (2011a) for the UK, and from Chantrill (2011b)
for the US. For Germany we get the data from Diebolt (1997) for periods 1920-1937 and 19501989 and from Eurostat for the period 1990-2009. For the war period 1939-1950 in Germany we
estimate public spending on education using out-of-sample predictions from a simple regression
of the German public spending on education on the US public spending on education.
To correct the probability of migrating to the US for potential migrant selectivity we rely
on time-varying information on the number of immigrants who arrived in the US in the years
each person was age 16-21 and 22-30. We obtain this information from the US Yearbooks of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. We measure the average inow during late puberty
and early adulthood because this is when people likely start to think about and potentially begin
to form plans to migrate. We separately measure inows for the earlier and later age-periods to
capture variation that occurs when people make their education and labor market participation
decisions, respectively.

We use ows rather than the stock of British immigrants in the US

because we could nd no consistently dened time-series data that measures the stock.
To show how these data vary over time and age, we plot, in Figures 1 and 2 education
spending by country and inows of British and German migrants to the US. Figure 1 plots
the raw data series across calendar years and Figure 2 plots the data for our analysis sample
after they are assigned to each individual. Specically, Figure 2 orders individuals along the

Long time-series on such disaggregated variables are not available.

Snyder and Dillow (2011)

provide separate data series on public and private education spending in the US by level of education from 1970
to 2010. Using those data we nd that the correlation between total private and public spending and between
spending in primary/secondary schools and post-secondary institutions exceed 0.9.

the mean spending during the years a person was of school-age and mean migration inows
to the US during the years a person was ages 16-21, and 22-30. Both instruments vary across
individuals of dierent ages and across individuals of the same age who were interviewed in
dierent calendar years.
Finally, we include measures of the average per-capita GDP in the US, the UK, and Germany during the years each respondent was a child, a teenager, and young adult. Apart from
predicting educational attainment, GDP is often used in the classic push-pull migration framework to control for the eect of economic development on an individual's decision to migrate.
That approach posits that unfavorable (economic, political, and social) conditions in the home
country push people to the host country, while favorable conditions in the host country pull
people from their home country. We draw these data from Maddison (2006).
Because we pool data from repeated cross-sections from the host (US) and home countries
(UK and Germany), we construct new sample weights so that our pooled samples are representative of the population in the home country in the year of the interview.

We construct

population weights with population data by year (of survey), age and sex from the the World
Health Organization mortality database.

3 Empirical strategy
The long route to identifying the interdependencies between migration and educational marital
mobility is to estimate, as jointly dependent, (i) the investment in education, (ii) the probability
of migration, (iii) the timing of migration, (iv) the probability of marriage, (v) the timing of
marriage, (vi) the choice of spouse based on education, and (vii) the choice of spouse based
on nationality. Because we could not nd the full set of data one would need to estimate this
structural system (especially data on the timing of marriage), we condense it to two equations
that model the probability to migrate and the joint probability of marrying and marrying a

well to answer the questions of interest while at the same time it benets from simplicity. First,
as we showed in Table 1, while migrants are a bit less likely to have ever been married than
non-migrants, the dierence is less than two percentage points. This makes us condent that
dierences in the probability of marriage by migration status will not signicantly bias our
results.

Second, our instrument for marital mobility addresses both educational and ethnic

homogamy and nets out dierences in educational attainment that might have occurred either
after a person married or in anticipation of future migration.

Third, our instrument for the

probability of migration addresses its endogeneity with the probability of marriage, and it also
makes the relative timing of the decision to marry and migrate largely irrelevant. We provide
detailed explanations below.

Our goal is to evaluate whether a person who migrated to the US and married a US native
is more or less likely to experience marital mobility than a person who did not migrate and
married a fellow non-migrant. That is, we want to know whether

P rob(M i = 1 | I i = 1) Q

P rob(M i = 1 | I i = 0), where I i = 1 if a person immigrated to the US. To answer that question
we model the joint probability of marrying and marrying a person with higher education, as
follows:

are parameters to be estimated; and

normally distributed error term. We use a standard probit model to estimate equation (2), by
gender, on the pooled sample of migrants in the host country and non-migrants in the home
country. The value

Î±
b1

that we obtain is a `naive' estimate of the migration eect on mobility

which is potentially biased because of two types of selection.

Specically, the probability of

marrying-up may dier by migration status (i) if migrants select their spouses based on a
dierent set of unobserved characteristics, or they have a dierent degree of marital selectivity,
relative to non-migrants (dierential assortative mating bias); and (ii) if migrants self-select
into migration based on unobserved characteristics that aect their choice of spouse or their
own marital appeal (migration selection bias). To nd the causal eect of migration on marital
mobility, we need to remove both types of bias.
The empirical literature that developed to test Becker's predictions on assortative mating
typically estimates the degree of marital sorting using earnings regressions from samples of
married couples. Controlling for observed factors and characteristics, such as schooling, age, and
work experience, the literature interprets the correlations of the ensuing residuals of the spouses
as indexes of marital selectivity. A set of studies use post-marriage earnings and characteristics
(Zimmer 1996, Zhang and Liu 2003), while others use pre-marriage earnings and characteristics
(Zimmer and Nakosteen 2001, Nakosteen, Westerlund, and Zimmer 2004).

The purpose of

this latter approach is to net out the eect of post-marriage developments that may cause
spouse wages to converge or diverge. In the spirit of this approach, we estimate educational
attainment observed after marriage using variation from an instrumental variable which is not
only measured before marriage but it is also independent of one's expectation to migrate; i.e,
public spending on education averaged over the years each person was of school age.

Our

choice of instrument relies on the premise that higher budgetary allocations are eective at
improving educational outcomes. Although international evidence does not always support this
assumption (see Hanushek 2003), recent research suggests that the relationship between public

11

education spending and educational outcomes is positive and statistically signicant in countries
with good governance (Rajkumar and Swaroop 2008). All three countries we study here fall
into this category. As is standard in the literature, we specify education spending as a share of
GDP while keeping GDP per capita constant, thus controlling for economic cycles.
We estimate the following model of demand for education:

Ei = Î¸0 + Î¸1 Yi +

X

Î¸2k Xki + Ïi

(3)

k
where

Y

is the instrumental variable;

Î¸

denotes parameters to be estimated; and

Ï

denotes a

normally distributed error term. The estimated residuals of (3) embody traits that inuence
not only the individual's potential for educational attainment but also his attractiveness to
potential spouses. For example, a large positive residual may reect a range of traits that are
visibly appealing such as exceptional ambition, mental and physical health, condence, favorable
socioeconomic family background, the ability to contribute to home production, and a range
of cultural or ethnic characteristics. The eects of such traits are not present in the predicted
values of (3) because these rely on variation in spending that is unrelated to characteristics
(other than education) that make an individual an attractive spouse.

As importantly, our

instrument is also independent of changes in educational attainment of either spouse which
happened due to marriage (e.g. by resources or information sharing between spouses), and of
investments in education of forward-looking individuals who anticipated access to a dierent
marriage market because they planned to migrate.
Because

Ei

has an ordered form and the error in the latent model is assumed to be normally

distributed, we can estimate the parameters by ordered probit.

We run this regression on

separate samples by country of residence in the survey year. We do not estimate this equation
separately by sex or by immigrant status because we want to make sure that the resulting
predicted values

bi
E

draw from the same distribution and can be compared across spouses. We

12

use these values to dene a new measure of marital mobility:

education using

M

as the dependent variable, as follows:

ci = 1) = Î²0 + Î²1 Ii +
P rob(M

Î²2k Xki + Îµi

(5)

k
As before, we estimate equation (5) by gender on the pooled sample of migrants and nonmigrants using probit regression. The value

Î²b1

that we obtain is now net of marital selectivity

eects, but it is still potentially contaminated with migration selection eects.
Our last step is to address migrant selectivity by modeling the probability that a person
migrates. For this exercise, we use the network of previous immigrants as an instrument that
aects the migration decision but is orthogonal to marital mobility. We assume that the network
of migrants aects the migration decision because it is correlated with the cost of migration. It is
easier for newly arrived migrants to navigate a new culture if they can tap into a larger migration
network that may provide advice on getting a visa, travel information, housing and nancial
support, help with the host language, and help with navigating local government bureaucracies
and other services (Carrington at al., 1996; Bauer et al., 2002; Munshi, 2003). The network
of migrants is orthogonal to our measure of marital mobility because we only look at crossnational marriages. We plausibly assume that the size of a given migrant community in the US
is not correlated with the probability that a migrant who belongs to that community marries
a US native who is more educated than the migrant himself.

Our instrument also addresses

potential simultaneity in migration and marriage that arises in those cases when marriage took
place in the country of immigrant origin and before the migration decision.

Those British

and German immigrants who met and married their US spouses in their home country (e.g.
the War Brides) are unlikely to have based their migration decision on networks of co-ethnic

13

6

migrants.

Our instrument, therefore, safely separates the association between migration and

marital mobility that arises because migrants marry US spouses in order to migrate to the US
(migration selection eect) from the association that arises because migrants marry US spouses
as a result of migrating to the US (causal eect of migration).

6 For example, researchers have documented that the War Brides, who probably form the majority of migrants
in our sample who entered the US married, did not move into an existing immigrant population or settle in
ethnic enclaves.

Rather, they were welcomed by, and often moved in with, the families of their husbands.

The war brides did not rely on co-ethic immigrant networks even for help with basic practicalities of their
migration process. They received advice and assistance with paperwork by the American Red Cross and ofter
their transportation to the U.S. was arranged and paid by the U. S. government (Virden 1996).

7 Alternative to using IV methods, one can also estimate our structural model with matching techniques.

We decided against using matching because we had very few proxy variables available. To be appropriate for
our empirical exercise, proxy variables should aect both the decision to migrate and the decision to marry a
spouse of a given education level, but they should not be aected by the decision to migrate (Rosenbaum and
Rubin, 1983).

Because migration likely aects many of the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals that

are measured post-migration (e.g. household size, income), only a few of the available variables can serve as
proxies; e.g., age and race. Relying on such proxies to carry out the matching estimation would likely violate
a key aspect of the strong ignorability assumption; i.e., that, after controlling for the proxies, marital mobility
should be independent of the selection into migration.

We also prefer IV estimation over matching because,

even when good proxies and good instruments are available, evidence suggests that the IV method outperforms
the matching method (see, for example, McKenzie, Stillman, and Gibson 2010).

4 Results
4.1 The migration eect on educational mobility through marriage
In Table 2 we showed that British and German migrants who marry US natives and live in the
US are generally more educated than British and German natives who never migrate and marry
non-migrants. Further, the US natives who are married to British and German migrants are also
more educated than the British and German natives who never migrate. To further examine
these patterns, in Table 3 we present indicators of assortative mating and marital mobility

(Mi )

by immigrant status and sex. The data show that the correlation of the educational attainment
between spouses is highest for German natives (0.57), and in all other cases it is lower and
roughly equivalent (about 0.39-0.46). However, women are more likely to marry more educated
spouses than men are, irrespective of their migration status. Specically, the marital mobility
rate for all migrant women and British native women is 37-40%, whereas the corresponding rate
for all migrant men and British native men is only 22-26%. For German natives the mobility
rates are relatively lower, consistent with the higher degree of assortative mating, but again

15

women are more likely to marry more educated spouses than men are (with probabilities 0.24
and 0.20, respectively).
To what degree are the above patterns due to assortative mating? To answer this question
we calculate new measures of assortative mating and marital mobility using the residuals and
the predicted values from the probit estimates of equation (3).

We estimate this equation

separately on the pooled CPS data of US natives and British and German immigrants, the
BHPS data of British natives, and the SOEP data of German natives.

Table 4 presents the

results. In all samples, respondents attained more education if, during the years they were of
school age, their government spent a larger share of GDP on education (holding GDP per capita
constant). The estimated eect is higher in the UK than in Germany and the US. However,
while attained schooling rises when governments spend more in either early or later schooling
years in Germany and the UK , in the US attained schooling is higher only when the government
spends more when people are of primary-school age.
In Table 3 we use the residuals for each partner in a couple from (3) and show that their
correlation coecients are positive and sizable.

Recall that these residuals measure attained

education that is not explained by public education spending, thus the correlations suggest the
presence of positive assortative mating on the basis of education across all groups.

We also

(given by equation (4)), which

measures prevalence of people who married a more educated spouse after removing variation
in education predicted by public education spending. The results suggest that, if spouses had
not selected each other on the basis of traits correlated to their educational attainment, then a
larger share of migrant men and women, and of non-migrant women would have been married
to more educated spouses. By contrast, a smaller proportion of non migrant men would have
been married to more educated spouses. Among all groups, non-migrant British and German
women would be the most mobile through marriage, since 86 percent of them would marry
a more educated spouse.

Non-migrant British and German men would be the least mobile

through marriage, since only 15-16 percent of them would marry a more educated spouse.
These patterns suggest that there may be gender-specic dierences in how migration aects

16

marital mobility. To obtain clearer evidence on this, in Table 5 we explicitly test whether and
to what degree migration determines the marital mobility of British and German men and
women. Table 5 presents the coecients on the migration indicator from equations (2) and (5)
that are estimated on: (i) the sample of British immigrants who are married to US natives and
live in the US (from the CPS data) pooled together with the sample of British natives who
are married to compatriots and live in the UK (from the BHPS data); and (ii) the sample of
German immigrants who are married to US natives and live in the US (from the CPS data)
pooled together with the sample of German natives who are married to compatriots and live in
Germany (from the SOEP data). In the rst and third columns marital mobility is dened as

Mi

(raw) and in the second and fourth columns it is dened as

ci
M

(estimated).

In columns (1) and (3), when we do not adjust our mobility measure for the eect of marital
sorting, we nd that German migrants are more likely to marry up relative to their non-migrant
counterparts (though for German men the dierences are small), whereas British migrants are
as likely to marry up as their non-migrant counterparts. When we purge out the marital sorting
eect we nd that, marital mobility is strongly associated with migration and the eects are
similar for migrants from both countries. Men who migrate are much more likely to marry a
more educated woman while women who migrate are much less likely to marry a more educated
man. In other words, there is something about the way migrants select their spouses that induces
men to marry down and women to marry up. Had there been no marital sorting, migration
would favor all migrant men relative to non-migrant men and it would disfavor all migrant
women relative to non-migrant women. In fact, the size of this eect would be substantial. The
results suggest that if all British men had stayed in the UK, then only 15% of them would have
married up, whereas in the extreme case that all of them had migrated to the US then 68%
of them would have married up. The corresponding eects for German men are 16% and 89%
respectively. Conversely, if all British women had stayed in the UK, then 86% of them would
have been married to more educated spouses, whereas if all British women had migrated to the
US, only 59% of them would have been married to more educated spouses. The corresponding
eects for German women are equally sizable; 86% and 64% respectively.

We next attempt to disentangle whether the estimated migration eect on

ci
M

is due to the

act of migration per se or whether it is because individuals who migrate dier in unobserved
ways that aect their probability of marrying up. Table 6 reports results from the estimation
of simultaneous equations (6) and (7), and simultaneous equations (6) and (8), by seemingly
unrelated bivariate probit regression. As before, in the rst and third columns marital mobility
is dened as

Mi

and in the second and fourth columns it is dened as

ci .
M

The rst-stage regressions produce positive coecients on the instruments in both the British
and the German samples. The likelihood that an individual migrates to the US increases with
the mean annual inow of compatriot migrants to the US both over the time individuals were of
age 16-21 and over the time they were 22-30. Interestingly, for men the coecients on migration
inows measured over the age of 16-21 are signicantly higher than those on inows measured
over the age of 22-30 (which are not statistically dierent from zero), while the pattern for
women is the opposite, suggesting that men form their preferences about migration at earlier
ages than women. In all cases, the Wald test rejects the hypothesis that the migration decision
is exogenous to marital mobility. The only exception to this is when we dene marital mobility
as

Mi

in the British sample, but in this case we also nd that the eect of migration on marital

mobility is statistically insignicant.
Interestingly, relying on exogenous variation in the migration decision does not signicantly
aect the estimated eect of migration on marital mobility in the British sample. Not only are
the migration coecients qualitatively robust across probit and bivariate probit models (Tables
5 and 6), but also the resulting marginal eects of migration on marital mobility remain very
similar in scale.

In contrast, instrumenting the migration decision does make a dierence in

most of the results from the German sample. The implication is that the dierence between the
naive and causal migration eects on marital mobility is driven mostly by marital selectivity in
the British sample, and by both marital and migration selectivity in the German sample.
To facilitate comparison, Table 7 presents the estimated selection eects and tests of their
statistical signicance. Marital selection eects are negative for men and positive for women,
and in all cases sizable and statistically signicant.

4.2 Discussion of the estimated eects
Our results suggest that, because of the way they select their spouses, migrant men reduce
their probability of marrying up, while migrant women increase it.

It follows that there are

sex and country-specic unobservable characteristics that drive marital selection, such that
they disfavor migrant men and they favor migrant women. Although it could be one of many
unobservables that t this prole, preferences of spousal traits are plausibly country and sexspecic and oer an explanation for our results. Becker argued that men specialize in market
production and women specialize in home production and his argument is valid even today.

8

If this entails that husbands determine the social status of the family, then men can aord to
marry down without loss of socioeconomic status and can select their wives on the basis of other
traits, especially traits related to home production. For example, men may select wives who are
young, healthy, fertile, and can run a household. Correspondingly, if women cannot determine
the social status of the family, they will prefer husbands who are well-educated, ambitious,
and can earn a living. This gender dierence in mate selection preferences and the resulting
patterns of female hypergamy and male hypogamy has been extensively documented in the social
sciences (Hadeld and Sprecher 1995, Cashdan 1996). Evolutionary psychologists claim that
the dierence is inherent and serves family survival, while social learning theorists claim that it
appears in male-dominated societies and should fade as women gain equal rights to men.

8 For example, the German government has, until relatively recently, set welfare and public support policies
according to a male breadwinner model. That is, the institutional structure in German provides strong nancial
and social incentives for couples to divide labor so that men specialize in market production and women specialize
in home production. Starting around 2000, German social policymakers began to reform institutions using a
dierent model (Meyer 1998). For information on the US, one can look at the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) - Child Development Supplement/Transition to Adulthood (CDS-TA) surveys. The CDS-TA surveys
interviews the person in the PSID household who identies herself/himself as the 'primary' care-giver (PCG) of
each child. Data from the 2002 and 2007 waves show that biological, adoptive, or step mothers comprise over
90 percent of self-identied care-givers.

19

In either case, this dierence is consistent with our results because it implies that migrant
men are at a disadvantage in the US marriage market whereas migrant women are not. Specically, studies that examine the earning trajectories of immigrants in the US show that, although
they eventually assimilate fully in the native population, during their rst years in the US they
suer a large earnings penalty relative to equally experienced natives.
up to 20 years for this penalty to disappear (Lubotsky 2007).

In fact, it may take

As a result, migrant men are

less competitive in the US marriage market than in their home market and, thus, they marry
down relative to their non-migrant counterparts. The earnings penalty and the delay in nancial maturity is less of a problem for migrant women because they are not typically expected
to be the primary bread-winners of the household.

Quite the contrary, migrant women may

possess advantageous traits which their US competitors do not possess. Researchers have often
documented a preference of US men for immigrant wives from the old world who retain traditional patriarchal family values, as opposed to US women who adopted materialism, liberal
individualism, and feminism earlier on (Honig 1998). Evidence that such preferences exist is the
presence of International Marriage Brokers (IMB) - an industry which specializes in facilitating
marriage between US native men and foreign women and is, essentially, the modern version
of the 'mail-order bride' industry that dates back to the 1800s. From this viewpoint, migrant
women are more competitive in the US marriage market relative to their home marriage market
and, thus, they marry up relative to their non-migrant counterparts
Our results also suggest that, in the absence of migration selectivity, both migrant women
and migrant men are more likely to marry up relative to non-migrants. However, because of
the way they self-select into migration, migrant men and women reduce their probability of
marrying up. This implies that unobserved characteristics that drive selection into migration
(e.g.

cultural characteristics, risk preferences, and language skills) make migrants willing to

marry less educated US spouses in exchange for other favorable provisions. For example, US
spouses may provide access to US residency and accelerate their assimilation in the US native
community, e.g.

by helping them nding employment.

Furtado and Theodoropoulos (2009,

2010) show that, indeed, cross-national marriage increases employment rates for immigrants,

20

and does so not only because of the legal status acquired through marriage but also through
native networks.

Our nding that migration selection eects are weaker for British than for

German migrants is consistent with this explanation. It is arguably more dicult for German
migrants to assimilate in the US than it is for British migrants, since British immigrants are
both culturally and linguistically more similar to US natives than German migrants. Likewise,
the natives' sentiments towards immigrants also depend on cultural and linguistic proximity.
For example, a nationwide poll in 1944 about which migrants the U.S. should allow to enter
the country showed that British immigrants were at an advantage, topping the list of preferred
foreigners with 68% positive votes. In that same poll, German immigrants ranked 7th, gathering
only 36% positive votes (Simon and Alexander 1993). Reports from German War Brides also
reveal that in the years following the end of WWII German immigrants faced discrimination
and were occasionally harassed as Nazis (Shukert and Schibetta 1988). In contrast, British
brides reported to have experienced hardly any discrimination after they arrived in the country
(Virden 1996).
The aforementioned selection eects mask the causal eect of migration on marital mobility.
After we purge out the selection eects, we nd that the causal eect of migration is positive
for men and negative for women - a nding which, at rst sight, seems contrary to expectations.
One would expect that the causal eect of migration would be positive for all migrants because
mean educational attainment in the US has been consistently higher than in Germany and the
UK over the period that the individuals in our sample were moving to the US and getting
married. We show this clearly in Figure 3 using data from Barro and Lee (2012). The data
suggest that, by moving to the US, all migrants got access to a marriage market where the
average candidate spouse was more educated than in the home marriage market.
The gender dierence in our causal estimates can be explained if the gap in the timing of
marriage diers between migrant and US native women. Because the surveys that we use for
the analysis provide no information on the timing of marriage, we obtained relevant information

9

from the US census.

The 1980 wave of the US census reports data on the age at rst marriage

9 Available at the international online database of Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS).

21

and country of birth of each surveyed individual. Using these data, Figure 4 compares kernel
density estimates of the age at rst marriage across British and German migrants and US
natives and clearly shows that both migrant men and migrant women get married around two
years later than US natives and that US women marry in a narrower time window than all
others.

From Table 2, we also know that women marry older men and men marry younger

women.

From this it follows that, if there was no selectivity at all, migrant men could take

advantage of the higher availability of educated partners in the US because their target-group
of potential US wives would not decrease as they delayed their marriage. In contrast, migrant
women would miss the window of opportunity to marry up since their target group of potential
spouses would decrease both in size and in quality as they delayed marriage.
The observed dierence in the age of rst marriage between migrants and US natives could
be either because of country-specic norms, or because the decision to migrate further delays
their marriage.

Data from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)

Statistical Database suggest that, while both of them are true, country-specic norms seem
more important for women. These data show that in 1980 the mean age at rst marriage in the
UK was 23 for women and 25.3 for men. The corresponding numbers for British immigrants
from the IPUMS database are 23.4 for women and 26.2 for men. Similarly, in 1980 the mean age
at rst marriage in Germany was 23.4 for women and 26.1 for men. The corresponding numbers
for German immigrants from the IPUMS database are 23.5 for women and 25.8 for men. These
data suggest that migrant British women and migrant German men and women follow closely
the norms regarding the timing of marriage from their country of origin. Migrant British men
delay their marriage decision by approximately an extra year relative to non-migrants.

4.3 Tests of performance and robustness
Some aspects of our analysis may cause concern. First, although the benets associated with
educational attainment and, by extension, with educational mobility through marriage may
dier across countries, our analysis implicitly assumes that they are comparable. For example,
we assume that a German who has a high-school degree will be better o migrating to the US

22

and marrying a US native with a post-secondary qualication than not migrating and marrying
a compatriot who also has a high school degree. In reality, whether or not this is true depends
on the monetary and non-monetary returns to a German high school degree relative to the
returns to a post-secondary qualication in the US. While we acknowledge this limitation, we
expect that, in our sample, sex-specic country dierences in the returns to education (monetary
and social returns combined) are not as prevalent across aggregate educational levels as they
are across types of education (e.g.

vocational vs.

general) and elds of specialization (e.g.

humanities vs. sciences) within aggregate educational categories. If these latter dierences are
not systematic, at the mean of each educational category they will tend to cancel out.
To obtain supporting evidence on this we test the robustness of our estimates to two more
conservative measures of mobility.

First, we collapse the education categories from the ve

used so far down to three (primary, secondary, and higher) and re-calculate mobility using our
standard denition (i.e. we set mobility to equal one if education of spouse>education of self,
and zero otherwise). Second, we use the original ve educational categories but set mobility to
equal one if the education of the spouse is higher than the education of self plus the sample
variance in educational attainment.

10

Both new measures of mobility are more restrictive and

thus more plausibly comparable across countries than the one we used in the baseline analysis.
We nd that the results are highly robust when we use these alternative measures. For brevity,
we conne ourselves to reporting the averages of the new mobility measures and the estimated
selection eects (the full set of results are available upon request). In Table 8 we show that,
while the size of the selection eects dier in absolute value, the results remain qualitatively
robust (though the estimates become noisier for German females).
Our identication strategy may also cause some concern. The migration inows which we
use to identify migration selectivity are aggregations of individual behavior which (depending

10 Using the sample variance in this way allows for equivalent shifts in raw and estimated mobility. Further,
because the variance of educational attainment is higher than one, the denition of raw mobility requires a gap
of at least one educational category between spouses. An individual with primary education is mobile if s/he
marries a spouse who has at least an upper secondary education, an individual with lower secondary education is
mobile if s/he marries a spouse who has at least post-secondary education; an individual with upper-secondary
education is mobile if s/he marries a spouse with at least tertiary education; and individuals with post-secondary
or tertiary education are never mobile.

23

on the age each individual migrated) may include the migrants in our sample.

Because of

this, the predictive power of our instruments may reect exogenous correlated eects (Manski
1993, 2000).

That is, it may reect that the migrants in our sample and the migrants in

our instrument may decide to migrate because they have unobserved similar characteristics or
because they are exposed to the same institutional or contextual factors (`Manski's reection
problem'). To partly account for such unobserved common factors in the models reported thus
far, we control for ten or ve-year birth-cohort xed eects. Because our instruments vary by
year of birth, including single-year cohort dummies would entail perfect multicollinearity. As
a robustness test, we now switch to using a full set of age and survey-year dummies, which
correct for exogenous correlated eects to the extend that such eects vary across the age and
survey-year dimensions.
For completeness, we re-estimate both the probit and the bivariate probit models using the
new xed-eects specication.

We present the resulting probit estimates in Table 9 and the

bivariate probit estimates in Table 10. In all cases, the estimates remain qualitatively robust.
Quantitative dierences are most apparent in the instrument coecients, which increase in
economic and statistical signicance in all cases apart from German males. In that sample, the
coecients on migration inows measured over the age of 22-30 become higher than those on
inows measured over age 16-21, which are now statistically equal to zero. These changes in
the instrument coecients also spill over to the eect of migration on marital mobility, which
becomes higher for women and somewhat lower for males.

The most notable dierences are

in the sample of British women, where the migration eect on raw mobility becomes positive
and signicant, and in the sample of German females, where the migration eect on estimated
mobility remains negative but is now highly signicant. On the whole, however, the inclusion
of the xed eects does not alter the main patterns in the results.

11

11 The reason why we present the xed-eects specication as part of our robustness analysis and not as our
main result is a practical one. The xed-eects specication causes separation problems so that the bivariate
probit does not achieve convergence to a maximum likelihood.

For this reason, to estimate the xed-eect

specications in many cases we had to change the set of controls in our models (compare notes of Tables 5 and
9). Importantly, in all cases, when we include xed-eects we are unable to jointly estimate equations (2), (5),
(6) and (7), and (6) and (8), and thus to conduct the tests for the parameter restrictions. Similar problems with
bivariate probit estimations have been reported by other researchers (e.g. Freedman and Sekhon 2010).

24

A further source of potential concern is that the bivariate probit regressions provide no
diagnostics for instrument performance. At times, economic studies that use bivariate probit
obtain diagnostics from 2SLS estimates (see, for example, Evans and Schwab 1995). While the
2SLS estimation provides the opportunity to thoroughly test the validity and explanatory power
of the instruments, it is not the appropriate method to use when the dependent variables are
binary. The incorrect assumption of linearity for a relationship which is in fact non-linear will
yield least squares estimates that have no known distributional properties (so that statistical
inferences are unreliable), are sensitive to the range of the data, may substantially mis-estimate
the magnitude of the true eects, and systematically produce probability predictions outside the
0-1 range. For these reasons, although we present 2SLS diagnostics, we do so with reservation.
To test that our instruments can be plausibly excluded as direct determinants of educational mobility through marriage, we calculate the Basman/Sargan
that they are uncorrelated with the error term.

To test whether our instruments have weak

statistic under the null that the instruments are jointly

statistically insignicant. Finally, we calculate the Wooldridge's robust score test under the null
that the migration decision is exogenous to marital mobility, which is equivalent to the Wald
test in the bivariate probit regression. Table 11 presents the instrument coecients from the
rst-stage 2SLS estimates along with the diagnostic statistics. In all cases, the estimates are
qualitatively robust in comparison to the ones produced by the bivariate probit and the diagnostic tests generally corroborate the good performance of the estimations.

The Sargan test

results indicate that the instruments are valid, the F-statistic is always statistically signicant
(though for men low enough to suggest weak identication), and the Wooldridge test fails to
reject exogeneity.
A number of patterns in these results add to our reservation about the linear probability
model.

First, the estimates suggest that if the mean annual inow of immigrants to the US

increases by 10,000 during the youth of British and Germans, then the probability that they
will migrate to the US increases by between 0.3 and 2.5 percentage points. Albeit plausible, the
OLS coecients appear to contradict those produced by the probit methods. For example, these

25

coecients are higher for British men than German men, while the bivariate probit estimates
suggest the opposite. It is, therefore, plausible that the least squares method fails to capture
important non-linearities and, thus, underestimates the true eect of migration networks on
the migration decision of German men.

In turn, this would also explain why the F-statistic

appears weak. Further inconsistencies between the linear and non-linear models appear in the
results of the exogeneity test. Unlike the Wald test of the bivariate probit, the Wooldridge test
produced after the 2SLS procedure fails to reject exogeneity of the migration decision in the
British sample when mobility is measured as
mobility is statistically insignicant.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we have tested whether the decision of British and German individuals to migrate
to the US and marry a US spouse provides them with better opportunities for educational
mobility through marriage.

Our analysis showcases that migration and marriage are jointly

determined decisions which involve complex selection mechanisms. We show that, by migrating
to the US, British and German migrants access a marriage market that oers more opportunities
for educational mobility through marriage relative to their respective marriage markets in the
home countries. However, this does not guarantee higher marital mobility rates for migrants
relative to non-migrants.
A number of factors work against the positive prospects of the US marriage market. First,
migrant women take little advantage of the availability of more educated candidate husbands in
the US because they marry later than native US women. Thus, absent any selection eects, they
miss the window of opportunity to catch the `good' spouses, and they end up with the `lemons'.
Further, unobserved characteristics that drive marital sorting disfavor mobility for migrant men
and favor mobility for migrant women - a result that can be explained if men specialize in market

12 Horrace and Oaxaca (2006) show that bias and inconsistency in the OLS estimators of the linear probability
model (LPM) increase with the share of LPM predicted probabilities that fall outside the unit interval. In the
models we report in Table 11, the sample share of the predicted probabilities that lie outside the unit interval
is 3.9% for British males, 1.4% for British females, 1.1% for German males, and 1.9% for German females.

production and select spouses with traits that help in home production, while women specialize
in home production and select spouses with traits that help in market production. Under this
scenario, migrant men who face an earnings penalty in the US are at a disadvantage in the
US marriage market, while migrant women who may possess competitive non-marketable traits
(e.g. more traditional values) may be at an advantage in the US marriage. In addition, we nd
that unobserved characteristics that drive selection into migration disfavor mobility for both
migrant men and women, suggesting that immigrants may be willing to marry-down in order to
marry-in. That is, they may exchange education of their US spouses for other benets, such as
help with assimilation in the US native community or access to US residence. The end-product
of the above eects is that migrating to the US and marrying a US native pays o (in terms of
educational mobility through marriage) for the Germans but not for the British.
These results provide a basis for taking into account immigrant selectivity when designing
immigration policy. For example, if the objective is to encourage skilled immigration, policymakers may consider loosening the rules for granting legal status to migrant spouses of natives.
If the objective is the social integration of immigrants, policy-makers may consider programs
which could act as substitutes for native contacts, such as programs that help immigrants to
nd a job.
Of course, our results cannot be generalized.

Our analysis has relied on immigrants who

marry natives in the host country and has overlooked those who marry co-ethnics. Marital and
migration selection eects are likely dierent for this latter group of immigrants, and would
be worth exploring. Our analysis has also relied on immigrants from two European countries
which dier in culture and language but are fairly similar in other important dimensions. For
example, travel and visa costs from Britain and Germany to the US are fairly similar. Moreover,
the economies of both countries have been growing at roughly similar rates in the same period
of time. In fact, their growth patterns have followed closely those of the U.S. Further work in
this area should examine immigrants from less developed countries and immigrants who face
varying entry costs.

Finally, because of data problems, our measure of marital mobility has

been one-dimensional. Although education is widely used as an key indicator of socio-economic

27

status, monetary measures of well-being have more straightforward economic interpretation.
Thus, an interesting question for future research, given that appropriate data become available,
is whether the causal eect of migration on marital mobility is sensitive to alternative denitions
of mobility, e.g. in terms of income, wealth,or occupation.
