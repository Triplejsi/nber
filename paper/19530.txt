Food Price Spikes, Price Insulation and Poverty
Kym Anderson, Maros Ivanic, and Will Martin
NBER Working Paper No. 19530
October 2013
JEL No. F13,Q02,Q17,Q18
ABSTRACT
This paper first considers the impact on world food prices of the changes in restrictions on trade in
staple foods during the 2008 world food price crisis. Those changes—reductions in import protection
or increases in export restraints—were meant to partially insulate domestic markets from the spike in
international prices. The authors find that this insulation added substantially to the spike in international
prices for rice, wheat, maize, and oilseeds. As a result, although domestic prices rose less than they
would have without insulation in some developing countries, in many other countries they rose more
than they would have in the absence of such insulation. The paper’s second purpose it to estimate the
combined impact of such insulating behavior on poverty in various developing countries and globally.
The analysis finds that the actual poverty-reducing impact of insulation is much less than its apparent
impact, and that its net effect was to increase global poverty in 2008 by 8 million people, although
this increase was not significantly different from zero. The paper examines the relative efficiency and
equity of trade restrictions and domestic policies, such as conditional cash transfers, than are designed
to provide social protection for the poor when international food prices spike. It also examines the
potential consequences of multilateral agreements to limit changes in restrictions on trade during such
times.

Food Price Spikes, Price Insulation, and Poverty
Many countries have responded to spikes in international food prices, such as those of mid 2008,
early 2011 and mid 2012, by adjusting their agricultural trade barriers in an attempt to partially
insulate their domestic markets from the price rises. Even when it may appear to each individual
country that it has been successful, in the sense that its domestic price rose less than the
international price for its food staples, this success is frequently more illusionary than real. The
reason is that these policy responses—reductions in import protection or increases in export
restraints—exacerbate the initial increase in the international price. Indeed, if both exporting and
importing country groups happened to insulate to the same extent, domestic prices in both
country groups would rise just as much as if no country had insulated (Martin and Anderson,
2012). In reality, however, countries intervened to different extents, so that the impact of price
insulation depends on both the actions taken by the country itself and the collective impact of
interventions by all other countries
The net effects on national and global poverty of such interventions could be favorable or
unfavorable. On the one hand, if countries where the poor are most adversely affected by higher
food prices insulate more than countries where the poor are less vulnerable to or benefit from
food price spikes, it is possible that such insulation reduces the number of people driven into
poverty. A related possibility is that, if countries where producers and consumers are better able
to deal domestically with such shocks transmit a larger portion of the increase in international
food prices to their domestic markets, the adverse global poverty impact of the original shock
will be less (Timmer 2010).
On the other hand, a more pessimistic possibility is that many of the countries that
insulate against shocks to international food prices are countries for which the impacts on
1

domestic poverty of higher food prices are minor or even pro-poor in the case where most of the
poor are net sellers of food staples. High-income countries, for example, are well-placed to
absorb price shocks because of the small shares of farm produce in the expenditures of their
consumers, their producers’ access to risk management tools such as futures and options
markets, and their relatively well-developed social safety nets. Even so, some high-income
countries continue to use insulating policy instruments such as variable import levies, or even
just specific tariffs whose ad valorem equivalent varies inversely with the border price. Another
example of this possibility is where large, poor, food-importing countries—for which insulation
is more expensive because it turns their terms of trade against them—insulate less than would a
small but otherwise similar country, and hence may not avoid adverse poverty outcomes because
of inadequate domestic social safety nets.
It is clear from these examples that, other things equal, alterations in trade restrictions
could increase or reduce the national and global poverty impacts of higher international prices.
Only by looking at data on the changes in agricultural distortions during periods of rapid
increases in international food prices, and estimating the impacts of consequent domestic price
changes on poverty in different countries is it possible to ascertain the net effects on national and
global poverty.
This paper begins by looking at data on the consumption patterns and income sources of
low-income households in a sample of thirty developing countries, where three-quarters of the
world’s poor live, in order to assess which commodities are likely to be important in affecting
poverty through changes in their commodity prices. We then turn to data on agricultural price
distortions, and in particular on relative movements in domestic and international prices, to

2

assess the extent to which countries insulated their domestic market from the changes in
international food prices during 2006–08.
With these data, we use a simple model to compare the actual changes in domestic prices
with those that would have occurred in the absence of price-insulating policies. These price
scenarios are then used to assess the impacts of food price changes on poverty both with—and in
the absence of—price-insulating policy behavior. They allow us to make a much broader
assessment of the impacts of price-insulating behavior on national and global poverty than has
previously been available. The final section examines alternative policy measures at unilateral,
regional and multilateral levels which—together with complementary domestic measures—
might more efficiently reduce the impact of future price spikes on poverty. The most costeffective policy instrument for dealing with the poverty impacts of price rises is likely to be a
domestic one—such as a well-targeted social safety net—that deals directly with the problem of
poverty vulnerability.

What price changes are important for the poor?
The direct short-run impact of food price changes on the well-being of a particular household
depends on the proportional change in the real price of a particular food times the household’s
net purchases of that food (Deaton 1989). Since food typically makes up a large share of the
spending of poor people, we would generally expect food price changes to have a large impact
on the living costs of the poor. However, the vast majority of poor people are rural (threequarters, according to Ravallion et al, 2007), and most poor rural people earn their living from
agriculture. Hence food expenditure shares alone are insufficient for determining the impact of

3

food price changes on poverty: account also needs to be taken of the shares of household income
obtained from the sale of food to obtain the net expenditures on food by the household.
The first two columns of Table 1 report the weighted-average shares of particular types of
food in aggregate food expenditures and in total expenditures by the poor for the thirty
developing countries for which we have detailed data on household expenditures and income
sources.1 Columns three through nine of Table 1 net out household production, and so are the
most relevant for present purposes. Six countries’ shares are shown as examples, together with
the weighted average for all thirty countries. The bottom row reveals that, for our sample of 30
countries, food accounts for 61 percent of the gross expenditures of their poor. While we would
like to consider all food expenditures, only a few of these products are homogenous enough to
have reasonably representative international prices so we focus on four—rice, wheat, oilseeds
and maize—that account for 41 percent of those gross expenditures.
Table 1 also shows that the poor are, on average, net buyers of food in most poor
countries. In only one of the countries shown (Vietnam) are the poor, as a group, net sellers of
the listed foods in aggregate, and there are only a few other cases where the poor are net sellers
of particular foods. Over the full sample of thirty countries, column 3 shows that the poor are net
buyers for all of the food items listed except maize. That column also reveals that rice, wheat,
oilseeds and maize account for 39 percent of the net food expenditures of the poor in our sample.

Extent of domestic price changes, 2006–08
The changes between 2006 and 2008 in domestic prices of each of these four key food items in
each of the thirty sample countries for which we have information on both income sources and
expenditure patterns are shown in Table 2, together with changes in nominal non-food prices as
measured by the non-food component of the consumer price index for each country.2 Clearly
domestic prices of these key foods generally rose considerably relative to non-food prices during
this period.

Impacts of changes in price distortions on international prices
To obtain an indication of the impact of the observed changes in trade restrictions on domestic
prices, we need first to estimate their impact on international prices. That involves taking account
of the changes in price distortions in countries that collectively account for a large share of world
consumption. Following Martin and Anderson (2012), to assess the implications of price
insulation on a homogenous product’s international price,

, we begin with the global market

equilibrium condition:

where

is the rate of distortion between the consumer price and international price.

With a focus on border measures, we can use a single variable for the power of the trade tax
equivalent,

where

.

Totally differentiating Equation 1, rearranging it, and expressing the results in percentage
change form yields the following expression for the impact of a set of changes in trade
distortions on the international price:

impact on the international price of a change in trade distortions in country depends on the
importance of that country in global supply and demand, as well as the responsiveness of its
production and consumption to price changes in the country, as represented by
that if all countries alter their distortions by a uniform amount (

and

. Note

the same for all ), the

elasticities of supply and demand are irrelevant to the impact on international prices, which will
change by an exactly-offsetting amount and so mean domestic prices rise as if no countries
insulated.
If we assume that output cannot respond in the short run and that inventory levels were
low enough in this high-price period that stock adjustments have no effect, then

. If we

further assume that the national elasticities of final demand ( ) are the same across countries,
then Equation 2 suggests we can estimate the contribution to international price changes
6

resulting from changes in national trade restrictions as simply the negative of the consumptionweighted global average of the

’s. To avoid dealing with interaction terms, we convert all

proportional changes into log-change form and decompose the change in the domestic price in
country i into the change in the world price and in the country’s own protection:
Equation 3
We are particularly interested in what the percentage change in the domestic price would
be in each country if all countries had refrained from insulating. This is obtained by estimating
the change in the international price that would result from all countries reversing their insulating
actions, plus the change from reversing country ’s own interventions. The proportional change
in

from its initial level can be recovered by recalling that, if we set the initial price level at

unity,
Equation 4
If, for instance, all countries reduce the power of the protection rate applied in their
market by 10 percent, the world price will rise by 10 percent. This means that a country that
changes its national protection by less than the weighted average global change in trade taxation
will experience a change in domestic prices that is larger than it would have experienced absent
insulation by all countries.
Estimates of the impacts of price-insulating behavior on international prices are reported
in the first column of Table 3.3 These are derived from annual protection changes estimated

3

To test the sensitivity of those results, column 2 of Table 3 reports the results if the supply elasticity is as high as
unity instead of zero in each country and the common demand elasticity is set at -0.2. Clearly, using these different
demand and supply elasticity assumptions makes little difference to the estimates (assuming still that those
elasticities are uniform across countries). This result is not unexpected given that net trade is a small share of

7

using domestic and border prices for those key food items in 103 countries that together account
for more than 90 percent of the world market for each of rice, wheat, maize and edible oils. Most
of those are obtained from the 82-country sample in the Distortions to Agricultural Incentives
(DAI) database that was recently updated by Anderson and Nelgen (2013).4 Because the DAI
database does not include data for some of the smaller developing countries for which we have
household data, we supplement the DAI data with estimates from other sources, particularly the
FAO’s domestic price and trade series. Details are provided in the Appendix. The results in
column 1 of Table 3 suggest that the aggregate effect of all countries’ price-insulating behavior
during 2006–08 was to raise the price in the international marketplace by 52 percent for rice, by
18 percent for both wheat and maize, and by 31 percent for edible oils.5
The extent of the contribution by each country to the changes in international rice, wheat,
maize and oilseed prices can be seen by the size of each country’s shaded rectangle in Figure 1.
In this diagram, the countries whose protection (measured by the proportional change in ) fell
by more than the increase in the international price—also shown in Figure 1 as the ‘world price
impact’ line—were effective in sheltering themselves from at least part of the increase in that
price. Those countries where protection fell by less than the increase in the international price
experienced a domestic price rise that was greater than would have occurred in the absence of

production and consumption of these food items in most countries, making each country’s share of world output
very similar to its consumption share.
4

For this study, a particularly important change from the version of the DAI used in earlier versions of this study
was a move from using unit values to international indicator prices when updating changes in international prices.
Of greatest importance for this study was the case of rice in India where the estimates of export prices in Pursell,
Gulati and Gupta (2009) were originally updated using export unit values and are now updated as an index to
parallel the proportional increase in the Thai 5% broken rice price. For 2006-2008, the unit value of India’s exports
was strongly affected by a large increase in the share of much-more-expensive basmati rice exports.

These are slightly higher from the comparable estimates for the three cereals in Martin and Anderson (2012),
because a larger sample of countries is used here.

insulation by all countries. Countries whose protection rate did not change experienced the full
proportional increase in the international price—an increase that results from both the original
shock and the additional effect of all countries’ price insulation.
For rice, it appears that China, Indonesia and Bangladesh reduced their protection enough
to have a smaller domestic price increase than they would have experienced without insulation
by any country. Other countries, such as India and the Philippines, insulated themselves to some
degree from the increase in the international rice price, but not by enough to offset the priceincreasing effect of all countries’ collective action. That is, for these and other countries their
domestic rice price increased more than it would have done in the absence of their own and all
other countries’ insulation.
For wheat, the countries that insulated sufficiently that their domestic price rose by less
than it would have in the absence of insulation by all countries include China, India, Turkey,
Pakistan and Japan. While most other countries insulated to some extent, they did not do so
enough to reduce the increase in their domestic price below the increase that would have
occurred in the absence of insulation. For maize, it appears that China, Korea, Indonesia and
India insulated enough to reduce the rise in their domestic price relative to the no-insulation
scenario, while for edible oils China and Japan appear to have insulated enough to reduce the rise
in their domestic price to less than the increase that would have occurred in the absence of
insulation.

Changes in protection in our sample countries
For the developing countries for which household data are available, the 2006–8 changes in
protection to the four key crop products are detailed in Table 4. The table suggests that
protection in most developing countries fell during the observed period. The table also includes
at the bottom, for comparison, several large countries for which suitable household data are
unavailable: their changes in protection are broadly similar to the changes in protection in our
sample countries, apart from Egypt and Russia where protection rates appear to have increased
for wheat and oils.

Domestic prices with and without insulation
We can now estimate the changes in domestic prices that that can be attributed to price insulation
policies. These domestic price changes, reported in Table 5, take into account two separate
simulated price impacts: first, the impact of insulation by the country itself and, second, the
insulation by the whole world. The first of these price changes is reported in Table 4 while the
second is the estimated change in world prices reported in column 1 of Table 3.
The simulated domestic price impacts of removing insulation in all countries vary
considerably across countries and commodities, depending on each country’s level of insulation
relative to the change in the international price. For example, the domestic price of rice would
have fallen more in China as a result of own-country and rest-of-world insulation, but only by 5
percent: its own 37 percent reduction in protection lowered its domestic price relative to the
international price, but the latter would have been 52 percent higher with global insulation.
Overall for our sample of 30 countries, in 30 percent of cases the domestic price changed in the
opposite direction to the country’s own change in protection.
10

Distribution of price changes due to different actions by developing and developed countries
With different countries applying different changes in protection during 2006–2008, some
countries achieved some degree of insulation of their domestic prices while others experienced
higher prices than they would if no country had insulated. The countries that insulated the most
vigorously “exported” price increases to the countries that insulated less. These “imports” and
“exports” of price increases could have important consequences for poverty. Some advocates of
price insulation argue that it can be used by developing countries to shift price increases to highincome countries which are much better placed to manage such shocks. To see whether this was
the case in 2006–2008, Figure 2 shows the distribution of price changes due to countries’ actions
from two perspectives: developed versus developing countries (in light blue), and within each of
those country groups (in dark red).
Consider first the impacts of the actions of developed and developing countries acting as
two aggregate groups. The light blue color set of bars in each sub-figure shows the magnitude of
the value change transmitted between developed and developing countries. That magnitude is
determined by the consumption share of each group (the x-axis) and the size of excess insulation
(over the international price change). As can be seen, in each case the actions of the developing
countries lower the extent of their own price rise at the expense of the developed countries. Only
in the case of rice did the impact of the developing countries’ actions not lower their own price
rise much. This is because rice consumption in developed countries is a tiny share of world
consumption and hence little of the rice price increase could be “exported” from those countries.
Second, consider the level of coordination among developing countries’ own actions, by
focusing on the dark red color bars which show how much of the international price change was
distributed within the group by group member actions. In the case of rice, for example, China,
11

Indonesia and Bangladesh insulated their markets much more than others, shifting the price
increases onto the shoulders of other countries. A similar situation can be observed for the
remaining crops, where China alone (plus India in the case of wheat) was successful in lowering
the extent of its own domestic price rise—but, in doing so, it put upward pressure on prices in
other countries.

Poverty impacts
Using our sample of 30 developing countries, we can now evaluate the poverty impacts of the
hypothetical price changes that would have been associated with the observed levels of price
insulation in the period 2006–08. To calculate poverty impacts, we follow the methodology of
Ivanic et al. (2012) who measure changes in poverty as a change in the number of people living
on less than 1.25 US dollars a day in 2005 PPP dollars. They do so by assuming household real
income, , depends on the expenditure required to achieve its initial level of utility, and on the
income generated by any farm business it operates:
Equation 5
where

is the cost of expenditure;

is the revenue from the farm firm (including

that which is consumed by the household; p is a vector of prices; w is a vector of wage rates; and
u is utility.
Differentiating gives Deaton’s net consumption measure:
Equation 6

12

where

is the household’s net purchases of food. In contrast with Hertel and Winters (2006)

and Jacoby (2013), we consider the change in the revenue accruing to the household through the
term, without allocating it into returns to labor and capital, because this allows us to assess
the income effects of changes in individual food prices on farm households much more precisely.
Because we consider such a short period, we assume that wage rates paid to labor sold outside
the farm firms do not respond to changes in food prices. Most studies that allow for a dynamic
path of response from commodity price changes to wages find quite small wage impacts in the
first year or two (see, for example, Lasco et al, 2008).
This approach only considers the short-run impact of the changes in food prices on
households’ agricultural sales and food expenditures. That is, we ignore any quantity adjustments
(increases in production or changes in consumption) because these are second-order impacts of
the price changes. Because elasticities of demand for the staple foods considered are typically
quite low the inclusion of second-order impacts on demand is unlikely to have a large impact on
the overall welfare impact. While the second-order impacts through changes in supply can be
much larger, there is little scope to change quantities supplied in the short run.
Two simulations are reported in Table 6. Starting from the hypothetical price levels
representing the world with no insulation in each case, the first simulation shows the
implications of the observed changes in trade distortions in all countries. The second scenario
assumes that developing and developed countries insulated by the average observed level for that
group. These simulations allow us to see whether developing countries were able to shift the
price increases onto the industrial countries that are so much better placed to manage the effects
of food price shocks, or whether the major redistributions of the price rises were between
developing countries. Both sets of results are shown in Table 6 in terms of percentage point

13

changes in the initial poverty rates as well as the estimated absolute changes in the number of
poor people.
According to the first pair of columns in Table 6, choosing to insulate helped around half
of the countries considered (13 of the 30) to lower the poverty rate relative to the outcome from
the initial exogenous international price shock. For many countries that insulated, however, the
results in this table suggest that the combined effect of insulation was actually to raise poverty.
Based on the second pair of columns, had all developing countries insulated by the average
degree of insulation for developing countries, all but five of those thirty countries would have
seen more of their people move out of poverty.
Based on the coverage of our sample of global poverty by region and income level, we
extrapolate sample poverty changes into poverty estimates at the global, regional and incomegroup level (low, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries). To perform this
extrapolation, we assign weights to the countries in the sample to make them represent all
countries for their particular income and regional group. With the inclusion of China and India,
our sample covers most of the regions and income groups with poverty and especially the
“pockets of poverty” among the lower-middle income countries of South Asia and the upper
middle-income countries of East Asia where our sample coverage is nearly complete.
Since, as shown in Table 7, our sample covers 76 percent of the world’s poor people, we
were reasonably confident that it would allow reasonable approximations of the impacts of food
price changes on global poverty. To formalize this intuition, we used the weights for the
countries included in our sample and for other developing countries for which poverty estimates
are available to evaluate the standard error associated with our sample estimates. To do this, we

14

performed a Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 runs in which we simulated normally6 and
independently distributed poverty changes in the set of 109 developing countries for which
poverty estimates are available. In each run, we calculated—using weights equal to each
country’s share of the global poor population—the poverty change for the whole population and
for our sample of thirty countries. We then measured the difference between the sample and the
population mean in each period and calculated the variance of this difference over our 10,000
observations. Finally, we calculated the ratio of this variance to the average weighted variance of
the sample outcomes, which we find to be equal to 1.47 percent. This implies that on average the
standard error of the estimates obtained from our sample is 12 percent of the sample’s weighted
standard deviation.
The poverty results in Table 6 suggest that the observed level of price insulation most
likely did not affect global poverty significantly. Global poverty appears to have risen by 8
million people as a result of insulation, a change that is smaller than the standard error for this
estimate of 10 million. Had all developing countries insulated identically at the average level for
developing countries so that any effect is due to exporting the price increases to high-income
countries, the overall global poverty change would have been a decline of 7 million, which,
given a standard error of 8 million, is also not significantly different from zero.
Three partial indicators are also revealing. The first is the effect of the observed changes
in domestic prices on poverty. This measure suggests that the observed increases in domestic
prices resulted in an increase in global poverty of 80 million people in developing countries
living below the $1.25 per day poverty line (Table 10) with a standard error of 19 million people.
The second measure, which we term the apparent poverty reduction from price insulation, is the

15

effect of altering trade restrictions on poverty assuming that the international price is unchanged
by countries’ interventions. This estimate is a reduction of poverty by 82 million people with a
standard error of 18 million people. It seems likely that policy makers—particularly in small
countries—would focus on this latter measure (shown for individual countries in Table 9)
because it does not require a model of policy choice in a world of many countries, and does not
require knowledge of the policy responses taken by other countries. For small countries, these
numbers are the impact of the country’s own price insulation on the poverty rate in their country.
For large countries, they overstate the benefits of price insulating policies by failing to take into
account the impacts of the country’s own insulating policies on the international price.
The third partial measure, which we report in the final two columns of Table 9, is the
implications of each country’s own insulation on its own poverty rate both directly through its
own price insulation, and through the effects of that insulation on world prices. This table shows
that while large countries’ own insulation (mainly in India, China and Bangladesh) has some
adverse implications for poverty by pushing up international price, the size of this impact is
generally dwarfed by the domestic impacts of their own insulation. This highlights the collectiveaction problem associated with this form of policy response—for individual countries, insulating
frequently appears to make sense as a way to reduce the poverty impacts of world price increases
even while it is collectively ineffective.

Some policy implications
Standard principles of economic policy suggest that the most effective approach in dealing with
the poverty consequences of price volatility is via instruments targeted most directly at the
problem. This suggests that a social safety net aimed directly at alleviating poverty is likely to

16

raise more individuals out of poverty than an indirect policy that operates through market prices
facing all consumers, and even more so than one at a country’s border since that also affects
producer incentives. In some settings pure safety net policies may not be feasible, and nations
adopt or consider alternative policies. For example, Gouel and Jean (2012) find that targeted
subsidies to domestic storage combined with trade policies yield more poverty reduction for each
individual country alone.
The apparent success of some countries in reducing the extent of increase in domestic
prices might lead one to encourage or assist other developing countries to achieve the same high
degree of price insulation. This would, however, run head-first into the collective action
problem: for commodities such as rice, where the market share of developed countries is small,
equally successful insulation by all developing countries—both exporters and importers—would
be very similar to no insulation at all.
What are the consequences of collective action problems for the effects of policies at
different levels - national, regional, or global? If price stabilization were only attainable through
price insulation, if all countries had the same responses to price volatility, and if all countries
were small, then the collective action problem would need to be addressed at the regional or
global level. Each country would, unilaterally, have an incentive to insulate to the same degree.
Using rational storage policies as suggested by Gouel and Jean (2012) offers some possibility of
diminishing the extent of beggar-thy-neighbor impacts than use of insulating trade policies alone.
However, this proposal is very different from the policies observed in the 2008 crisis: global rice
stocks—and stocks in most major developing countries—increased rather than decreased during
2007–08, despite extraordinarily high prices.

17

The result that the largest developing countries tend to insulate their markets more than
other countries raises important questions for their policy makers. That this occurred despite a
higher cost to large importing countries than others of unilateral insulating action7 is something
of a puzzle. Are policy makers taking full account of the impact of their actions on international
prices? In the case of food-exporting countries, their insulating action improves their terms of
trade but risks alienating their trading partners. Perhaps part of the explanation is that the largest
developing countries have historically been close to self-sufficient, and hence their policy
makers are not overly worried about developing a reputation as an unreliable exporter—a goal
that appears to have contributed to a pressure by farm interests, in such countries as the United
States and Australia, against export restrictions.
At the regional level, there may be scope for policy commitments that reduce the adverse
impacts of beggar-thy-neighbor policies. If, for instance, regional groups were able to make
binding commitments to allow exports to flow even during times of shortage, then this may
reduce the deep-seated concerns of policy makers in importing countries about the availability of
sufficient importable food in times of crisis. Rice in Asia is the most obvious case in point.
It is understandable that countries depending heavily on the international food market
worry that they might be vulnerable to export controls or taxes imposed by their suppliers. At the
WTO, many importing countries have put forward proposals for disciplining export barriers
(Congo 2001, Japan 2000, Jordan 2001, Korea 2001 and Switzerland 2000). Some of these
proposals are far reaching. For example, the Jordan proposal is to ban export restrictions and
bind all export taxes at zero. The proposal by Japan involves disciplines similar to those on the

7

The welfare costs of unilaterally reducing the domestic price rise are higher in a food-deficit large country than a
small one because such action by a large importing country causes the international price to rise and hence increases
the welfare cost of achieving any given reduction in the extent of the rise in the domestic price.

import side, with export restrictions to be replaced by taxes and those export taxes to be bound.
Recognizing that importers' concerns about the reliability of supply might inhibit liberalization,
some exporting countries have also advocated multilateral limitations on the right to use export
restrictions. In the preliminary negotiations on agriculture held between 1999 and 2001 under
Article 20 of the Uruguay Round Agreement on agriculture, the Cairns Group (2000) and the
United States (2000) put forward proposals for disciplines on export barriers and/or taxes.
The ability of importing countries to lower protection when prices rise is currently
unconstrained by WTO rules. Countries with low initial tariffs have little scope to reduce their
protection when world prices rise, but they can introduce import subsidies—as indeed some
countries did in 2008. If exporting countries were to be restrained by WTO rules from
introducing export barriers, however, there would be less reason for tariff reductions by foodimporting countries.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have analyzed the distributional and poverty impacts of the food price
insulation that was observed in the period of 2006–2008 when prices of many staple food items
increased sharply. For four major food items—rice, wheat, maize and edible oils—which
comprise nearly half of poor people’s food expenditure, we have estimated how much the
observed insulating actions of more than 100 countries, taken as a whole and individually,
affected international and domestic food prices and how much it alleviated an increase in global
poverty.
As in other recent studies, we find that the observed patterns of price insulation resulted
in such a rise of international prices, one which virtually completely offset the benefits of

19

insulation. We also find, however, that developing countries as a group insulated more than
developed countries and, as a result, parts of the price increases were “exported” to developed
countries. This pattern of insulation applies to all four commodities considered in this study, but
least so in the case of rice because developed countries represent only a tiny portion of global
rice consumption. Nonetheless, the price increase absorbed by developed countries was so small
that its implication for global poverty appears negligible.
Our results highlight the seriousness of the problem of rapid increases in food prices in
the 2006–2008 period. We find that the rise in poverty resulting from the increases in the
domestic prices of the four commodities considered in this paper was 80 million people. For
many countries, price insulation appeared to be an effective policy for dealing with this
challenge. We estimate that the changes in trade policies (mostly reductions in protection) would
have reduced poverty by around 82 million if these policies had been adopted with no changes in
international prices. However, the adoption of these insulating prices caused substantial
increases in international prices, making them much less effective than they appeared in reducing
the poverty impacts of the initial increases in world prices. These results highlight an extremely
important collective action problem—policies of insulation that are effective for many individual
countries are ineffective for developing countries as a group, because both exporters and
importers so respond.
A number of caveats to this analysis need to be kept in mind. One is that we have
examined the price effects for just four food items. Including all food items is unlikely to alter
the main conclusions, though, because the four included items are so important within the set of
traded food products for which price insulation plays a major role. Another caveat is that we
have not taken account of any indirect effects on poor households that come via factor markets.

20

In agrarian economies with the vast majority of workers employed in agriculture, an increase in
farm product prices may raise unskilled wages, although much of this effect may take longer
than the short period we consider. That would lower the adverse impact on landless laborers of
higher food prices (although we have not found this channel of effect to change the results
substantially in earlier work in this vein—see Ivanic and Martin, 2008 and Ivanic et al, 2012).
The literature suggests that social safety net policies can generate larger reductions in
poverty, with fewer by-product distortions, than nth-best trade policy instruments that are used
for social protection.8 They could take the form of targeted income supplements to only the most
vulnerable households, and only while the price spike lasts. The potential of these approaches is
now much greater than it was just a few years ago, thanks to the digital information and
communication technology (ICT) revolution. In the past it has often been claimed that such
payments are unaffordable in poor countries because of the fiscal outlay involved and the high
cost of administering such handouts. However, recall that in roughly half the cases considered
above, governments reduced their trade tax rates or paid import subsidies, so even these trade
interventions frequently required budget resources—as did the replacement in many cases of
non-prohibitive export taxes with bans. In any case, the option of using value-added taxes in
place of trade taxes to raise government revenue has become common practice in even lowincome countries over the past decade or two (Besley and Persson 2013). Moreover, the ICT
revolution has made it possible for conditional cash transfers to be provided electronically as
direct assistance to even remote and small households, and even to the most vulnerable members
of those households (typically women and their young children). True, if those targeted have a
greater propensity to spend on food than those being taxed to fund the transfers, they would

Indeed conditional cash transfers can contribute not only to equity but can also enhance economic growth. See
Alderman and Yemtsov (2013).

boost the global demand for food and hence there would still be a beggar-thy-neighbor impact on
international prices (as stressed by Do et al, 2013). Almost certainly, however, that would be far
smaller than the impact generated by the much blunter approach of altering trade restrictions.

Appendix
The changes in domestic and border prices for the four key food items are compiled for 103
countries that together account for more than 90 percent of the world market for each of rice,
wheat, maize and edible oils. For the present analysis, data are required on changes in domestic
and international prices for a set of countries that cover a very large fraction of world
consumption, plus estimates of changes in protection in the set of countries for which we have
detailed data on production and consumption of each food at the household level. The
Distortions to Agricultural Incentives (DAI) database (Anderson and Nelgen 2013) provides
annual estimates of agricultural price distortions in 82 countries that are most important in
influencing world prices. Because the DAI database does not include data for some of the
smaller developing countries for which we have household data, we supplement the DAI data
with estimates from other sources, particularly the FAO’s domestic price and trade series.
To assess changes in protection at the country level, we consider changes in international,
domestic and country-specific border prices of four key food items. Our estimates of the
international price changes come from the World Bank’s Global Economic Monitor (GEM)
database. Because for most commodities the GEM reports a set of prices for specific varieties
(e.g. US Hard Red Winter wheat etc.) we calculate and use unweighted averages of all available
international prices.
For domestic prices, we turn to the available DAI and FAO databases which usually
contain a single price estimate for most agricultural commodities and countries. For edible oils,
where a producer price index was not available, we calculated a weighted price index including
several important oil seeds (soybeans, sunflower, groundnuts, rapeseed) in addition to palm oil.
In a very few cases where FAO producer price data were not available, we used the FAO
38

GIEWS database to identify the changes in domestic prices using that source’s most relevant
price series available.
To get a sense of the extent of changes in trade restrictions during 2006–08, we present
below some summary material for each of the four food items.

Rice
Rice prices increased substantially between 2006 and 2008. The first part of reports that the
changes for three international indicator prices averaged close to 120 percent in nominal US
dollars. National border price changes (shown in Appendix table 1 in US dollars) were generally
smaller, with the median price increasing by 78 percent. Most of the border price changes that
we observe range between 53 and 102 percent. The reasons they differ from the international
reference price changes may include: contractual arrangements that delay adjustments in the
prices of traded goods; differences between the types of rice traded; and freight costs that make
the export prices that are quoted internationally more volatile than most border prices.
Changes in domestic prices of rice were more subdued than changes in the border prices.
This is also shown in Appendix figure 1. The median price rise was only 44 percent, with half of
the price increases in the 30 to 64 percent range. Because domestic prices generally rose less
than international prices, we also observe a reduction in protection,12 with a median change of 18 percent. Most countries’ protection rates fell between 0 and 30 percent.

12

Protection is defined as the ratio of the domestic price to the border price of a like product. If there are no other
price-distorting policies than border measures, as assumed here, this is both the farmers’ nominal assistance
coefficient and an indicator of the distortion to the domestic consumer price. For some countries this indicator may
be negative, usually because it is an exporting country with an export restriction, although in rare cases it indicates
import subsidization.

39

Wheat
According to the World Bank’s Global Economic Monitor database, the price of wheat traded
internationally increased substantially between 2006 and 2008, with US soft red winter wheat
rising by 71 percent and Canadian Western Red Spring wheat rising by 110 percent. Using the
data from the FAO database, however, we observe much greater variation in border price
changes between countries (Appendix table 1). Some countries experienced negligible price
changes while other countries experienced price increases of over 200 percent. For the majority
of countries, the wheat border price rise was between 80 and 120 percent.
Domestic wheat prices rose much less than the large increases in border prices for most
countries. The median domestic price change was 70 percent, and most countries experienced a
price increase between 35 and 100 percent (Appendix figure 1). Because domestic prices
changed at very different rates from the border prices, there is a sharp reduction in protection.
The observed median change in the protection index is only -0.1 percent, but most of the
countries’ protection fell between zero and 25 percent.

Maize
The international price of maize rose by 83 percent between 2006 and 2008 (Appendix table 1).
The median change in border prices was 94 percent, with half the observations between 60 and
110 percent (Appendix figure 1). Domestic prices changed much less with a median price change
of 49 percent and most countries experiencing increases in domestic prices between 30 and 85
percent. Corresponding to these differences in domestic and international price changes we
observe a reduction in protection with a median fall of 17 percent and the majority of the cuts
between 10 and 30 percent.
40

Edible oils
Oilseeds and edible oils are much more complex to monitor than cereals because of the diverse
set of commodities involved. To obtain at least a broad guide on price developments in this
market, we examine three key oil products—palm oil, palm kernel oil, and soybean oil—to
obtain the average changes in international prices shown in Appendix table 1 and the distribution
of changes in border prices, domestic prices and protection in Appendix figure 1. In order to
measure the changes in domestic and border prices for edible oils, we consider a consumptionweighted price index for palm oil and major oil seeds (soybeans, cottonseed, soybeans, and
groundnuts). We report a distribution of so-defined border prices in and find that the median
border price change was 85 percent and that the majority of border price changes were between
55 and 110 percent. As with other commodities, domestic prices changed much less with a
median price change of 54 percent and most of price changes between 30 and 80 percent. The
median fall in protection was 12 percent, with half of the falls between 2 and 30 percent.
