What Is the Case for Paid Maternity Leave?

ABSTRACT
Paid maternity leave has gained greater salience in the past few decades as mothers have increasingly
entered the workforce. Indeed, the median number of weeks of paid leave to mothers among OECD
countries was 14 in 1980, but had risen to 42 by 2011. We assess the case for paid maternity leave,
focusing on parents' responses to a series of policy reforms in Norway which expanded paid leave
from 18 to 35 weeks (without changing the length of job protection). Our first empirical result is that
none of the reforms seem to crowd out unpaid leave. Each reform increases the amount of time spent
at home versus work by roughly the increased number of weeks allowed. Since income replacement
was 100% for most women, the reforms caused an increase in mother's time spent at home after birth,
without a reduction in family income. Our second set of empirical results reveals the expansions had
little effect on a wide variety of outcomes, including children's school outcomes, parental earnings
and participation in the labor market in the short or long run, completed fertility, marriage or divorce.
Not only is there no evidence that each expansion in isolation had economically significant effects,
but this null result holds even if we cumulate our estimates across all expansions from 18 to 35 weeks.
Our third finding is that paid maternity leave is regressive in the sense that eligible mothers have higher
family incomes compared to ineligible mothers or childless individuals. Within the group of eligibles,
the program also pays higher amounts to mothers in wealthier families. Since there was no crowd out
of unpaid leave, the extra leave benefits amounted to a pure leisure transfer, primarily to middle and
upper income families. Finally, we investigate the financial costs of the extensions in paid maternity
leave. We find these reforms had little impact on parents' future tax payments and benefit receipt. As
a result, the large increases in public spending on maternity leave imply a considerable increase in
taxes, at a cost to economic efficiency. Taken together, our findings suggest the generous extensions
to paid leave were costly, had no measurable effect on outcomes and regressive redistribution properties.
In a time of harsh budget realities, our findings have important implications for countries that are considering
future expansions or contractions in the duration of paid leave.

1 Introduction
The past 50 years has seen a steady increase in the number of countries oering government funded
parental leave.

1

By 2013, all OECD countries except for the United States had federally funded

programs, which generally oer high earnings replacement and employment protection to mothers
who were working prior to giving birth. But the even more striking trend has been the substantial
increase in the duration of paid leave. As illustrated in Figure 1, the median number of weeks of
paid leave to mothers among OECD countries was 14 in 1980, but had risen to 42 weeks by 2011.
From a policy perspective, it is important to distinguish between the introduction of paid leave (and
job protection) versus continual expansions to a program. Government-mandated leave programs
involve large transfer payments to a sizable population, and the key question is whether benets
outweigh costs, both on the extensive and intensive margins.
The main argument for paid leave is that there are important social goals or market failures
addressed by the program.

In the policy arena, proponents claim that paid leave could enhance

child development by increasing parental time investment, promote gender equality through higher
maternal employment, and encourage fertility and marriage by facilitating family and career compatibility. Paid leave could also serve as a transfer program with desirable redistribution eects. If
there are no public benets, however, paid leave can only be justied if it alleviates market failures.
In particular, binding credit constraints could limit the intertemporal substitution of maternal labor
supply after birth or prevent families from investing optimally in children.
A comprehensive evaluation of the case for paid parental leave requires answers to at least four
key questions. First, does paid leave increase available parental time with children, or does it simply
crowd out unpaid leave? Second, what eect does paid leave have on a broad range of child, parent
and family outcomes? Third, how do any benets compare relative to costs? And nally, are there
progressive or regressive distributional eects?
We answer these questions in the context of Norway's parental leave program, focusing on parents'

1 Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy and Poland introduced paid parental leave in the 1960s or earlier; Hungary,
Spain, Sweden, Finland, France, and Norway in the 1970s; Iceland, Denmark Portugal, Turkey, Greece, Germany
and New Zealand in the 1980s; Canada, the Netherlands, Japan, the Slovak Republic, Australia, Belgium, Ireland,
Luxembourg in the 1990s; and the United Kingdom in the 2000s.

responses to the evolution of leave benets over time. There have been seven major reforms in leave
policy which expanded the amount of leave taken by mothers without having a signicant eect on

2

fathers.

In 1977, Norway introduced 18 weeks of paid parental leave and extended job protection

from 12 weeks to one year. In the ensuing years, from 1987 to 1992, there were a series of policy
reforms which expanded paid leave from 18 weeks to 35 weeks (without changing the length of job
protection). While prior work has documented an impact on childrens' high school graduation rates
and future wages from the initial 1977 reform (Carneiro, LÃ¸ken and Salvanes, 2011), we investigate
whether the subsequent generous expansions had any added eect on outcomes which could justify
their additional costs. In a time when most countries are facing harsh budget realities, it is important
to critically evaluate whether these scally expensive parental leave extensions had the desired policy
eects.
Each of the reforms specied a birth cuto date to determine eligibility for benets.

Parents

of children born after the cuto date were eligible for extra weeks of paid leave relative to those
parents with children born before the cuto. We use a regression discontinuity (RD) estimator to
obtain causal estimates of the eect of extra weeks of paid leave on a variety of outcomes. The idea
is to compare families to the left and right of this cuto, since they should be similar on average
except for the extra allotment of paid leave from the government. By estimating the eect for all
expansionary reforms, we can assess whether child, family or social benets continue to accrue as
the generosity of the program increases, or whether additional weeks of paid parental leave simply
represent transfer payments without measurable dierences in outcomes.
Our rst empirical result is that none of the reforms crowd out unpaid leave.

Each reform

increases the amount of time spent at home versus work by roughly the increased number of weeks
allowed. Since income replacement was 100% for most women, the reforms caused an increase in
mother's time spent at home after birth, without a reduction in family income. This allows for a
clean estimate of the eect of parental time on child and family outcomes, as there are no income
eects to worry about. The same is not true in other settings where income is only partially replaced

2 With the exception of a few weeks specically reserved for mothers, these leave reforms allowed couples to divide
up the weeks of leave as they saw t. In practice, however, the entire amount of leave was taken by mothers.
Throughout this paper, we therefore refer to parental leave and maternity leave interchangeably.

or where there is crowd out of unpaid leave.
Our second set of empirical results reveals the expansions had little eect on a wide variety of
outcomes other than mothers' time spent at home after birth. Not only is there no evidence that
each expansion in isolation had economically signicant eects, but this null result holds even if we
cumulate our estimates across all expansions from 18 to 35 weeks. We nd no eect of paid leave
on children's academic achievement or graduation from high school.

We also nd no evidence of

systematic changes in parental earnings or participation in the labor market in the short or long run,
which means the leave expansions did nothing to gender equality on these dimensions. Finally, there
is little evidence the expansions to parental leave aected completed fertility, marriage or divorce.
Our third nding is that paid parental leave has regressive redistribution properties. The program
makes regressive transfers both from ineligibles to eligibles and within the group of eligible mothers.
Since there is no crowd out of unpaid leave, the extra leave benets amount to a pure leisure
transfer. Around 74 percent of all mothers were eligible for paid leave during our time period, since
a requirement is that the mother works a certain amount prior to the child's birth. Mothers who
are eligible and receive parental leave benets are higher educated, are married to higher educated
men, and have substantially higher family income compared to ineligible mothers. The dierences
in income between ineligibles and eligibles are even larger when comparing eligible mothers to the
relatively poor men and women who never have children. Within the group of eligible mothers, the
transfer payments were larger to women with higher prior earnings (since the program gave 100%
income replacement up to a high threshold); not surprisingly, this type of women also resides in a
family with higher total family income.
Finally, we investigate the nancial costs of the extensions in paid parental leave. We nd these
reforms had little, if any, impact on parents' future tax payments and benet receipt. As a result,
the large increases in public spending on parental leave imply a considerable increase in taxes, at
a cost to economic eciency. We estimate a one week increase in paid leave costs taxpayers $687

3

dollars (in 2010 dollars) on average per birth, based on all the reforms we study.

These costs

3 Leave benets are taxable at the individual level, but tax revenue is also lost due to the foregone income of
mothers on leave. In our setting where there is no crowd out of unpaid leave and 100% income replacement, these two
tax eects roughly cancel each other out, so the after tax costs of the program are approximately equal to program

3

add up:

the initial 18 week reform costs an estimated total of $12,354 per eligible birth, while

the subsequent expansions from 18 to 35 weeks costs taxpayers $11,668 per eligible birth. Stated
dierently, payments in 1992 when leave benets totaled 35 weeks cost a total of over $1 billion (in
2010 dollars), or approximately 0.5% of GDP.
Taken together, our nding suggest the case for extensions to paid maternity leave cannot rely
on observable dimensions of public benets or redistribution.

Nor do paid leave extensions seem

to alleviate binding credit constraints which would limit intertemporal substitution of labor supply
or prevent optimal investment in children: there is no evidence of changes in labor supply in the
short or long run; there is no measurable eect on child development; and most transfer payments
are received by middle or upper class families, who are less likely to face binding credit constraints.
In light of previous studies, one can argue whether a baseline level of paid parental leave or job
protection is worth the cost. But the case for extended paid leave periods, which are prevalent in
OECD countries, is weak. One would have to argue there are benets not captured in the relatively
rich set of outcome variables we look at. We discuss this possibility in more detail in the conclusion
of the paper.
Our ndings are related to a growing literature on paid parental leave introductions and extensions.

Researchers have examined the eect of paid leave on parental employment and earnings,

4

child outcomes, and fertility and marriage.

While these papers make important contributions to

our understanding of parental leave, there is no consensus across studies.

Consider the research

most closely related to our study. In a series of papers, Baker and Milligan (2008a, 2008b, 2010)
evaluate the extension of leave from 25 weeks to 50 weeks in Canada, with an earnings replacement
rate of 55%. They nd that while it increased breastfeeding, it had little eect on child health and
development up to age 3 and negative eects on verbal and self-awareness scores at ages 4 and 5.
Rasmussen (2010) nds that a single expansion of leave in Denmark did not aect later educational
outcomes, while Liu and Skans (2011) nd that a single leave expansion in Sweden resulted in in-

expenditures.
4 See, for example, Baker and Milligan, 2008a, 2008b, 2010; Carneiro, LÃ¸ken and Salvanes, 2011; Dustmann and
SchÃ¶nberg, 2012; Lalive et al., forthcoming; Lalive and Zweimuller, 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Rasmussen, 2010; Rossin,
2011; Ruhm, 2000; SchÃ¶nberg and Ludsteck, forthcoming; and Waldfogel et al., 1999.

creased academic test scores for children of highly-educated mothers but otherwise had no eect.
Finally, Dustmann and SchÃ¶nberg (2012) examine two paid leave and job protection expansions
(from 2 to 6 months and from 6 to 10 months), as well as an increase in job protection from 18
months to 36 months. These expansions provided a low level of earning replacement (a at amount
equal to about 20 to 30 percent of average pre-earnings, plus a means tested amount after 7 months).
They nd little eect of the rst two expansions, but some negative eects for the increase in job
protection without a corresponding increase in payments.
Our paper expands and claries this prior literature in several important ways.

First, we are

able to look at a broad range of outcomes in the same setting over time. Second, we provide direct
evidence on the cost side of these policies and their distributional eects. Third, we examine a series
of six expansions.

Not only does this give us multiple quasi-experiments, it also helps determine

whether modest expansions are worthwhile, even if further, larger expansions are not. A comparison
between benets and costs of marginal expansions is key to determine the optimal duration of paid
parental leave. Fourth, the reforms we study each extended paid leave without any changes in job
protection, which helps isolate the eect of paid leave from employment protection. Fifth, take up
is essentially 100%, in contrast to other countries with less generous leave programs.

Finally, we

are able to hone in on the counterfactual to paid leave because there is no evidence of crowd out
of unpaid leave and there was 100% income replacement. This helps us interpret the expansions to
paid parental leave as increases in the amount of time spent at home versus work, holding family

5

income constant.

Our paper is also related to a large literature on maternal employment and child outcomes (see
Blau and Currie (2006) for a review). That literature is largely inconclusive, with much of the work
suering from endogeneity issues related to which women choose to work (Gregg and Waldfogel
(2005), Tanaka (2005), Gregg et al. (2005)). Our setting is ideal to study the eect of maternal
employment for two reasons: (i) paid leave did not change the family's income, but only mother's
weeks of work and (ii) there are no concerns with sample selection as take up is 100%; our estimates

5 There was almost no governmentally provided child care coverage for children under the age of 2 during this
period (Mogstad and Havnes, 2011). As a result, the counterfactual to parental care is usually informal care, including
relatives and nannies.

are internally valid for working women. Our ndings suggest that maternal employment between
the ages of roughly 4 to 9 months has little eect on a child's later outcomes (as well as no eect on
couple's labor market participation, fertility, or family stability), even when family income remains
constant.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides background on paid
parental leave in Norway and our data. Section 3 briey discusses our regression discontinuity design
and threats to identication. In Section 4, we present our main results, followed by a comparison of
costs versus benets and distributional eects in Sections 5 and 6. Section 7 concludes.

2 Background and Data
2.1 Background
6

Governmental paid parental leave has a long history in Norway.

In 1977, parents were granted

7

18 weeks of paid leave and job protection for paid and unpaid leave up to one year.

During the

late 1980s and early 1990s, the paid leave period gradually expanded, so that by 1992 there was a
maximum of 35 weeks of paid leave, but no increase in job protection. Figure 2 gives an overview
of the introduction of paid parental leave in 1977 and the yearly expansions from 1987-1992.
The parental leave mandates provide 100% income replacement up to a generous earnings threshold. The earnings thresholds are non-binding for most mothers, and when they are exceeded, most

8

public and private employers top up benets so that foregone earnings are fully replaced.

The rm

is not allowed to dismiss the worker for taking leave, and the parent has the right to return to a
comparable job.

Apart from a few weeks reserved for the mother, parents could share 35 weeks

between them as desired before 1993. Up to that point, the program was de facto a maternity leave

9

program, as very few fathers took any amount of leave.

6 Our discussion of parental leave in Norway builds on Carneiro, LÃ¸ken and Salvanes (2011), Dahl, LÃ¸ken and
Mogstad (forthcoming), and Rege and Solli (2010).
7 Prior to this, parents had 12 weeks of job protection due to legislation passed in 1956, but no paid leave.
8 In 2010, benets were capped at earnings of approximately $75,000. Only 7% of mothers earned more than this
threshold.
9 Starting in 1993, father quotas have been added in subsequent reforms, mostly on top of existing parental leave.
See Dahl, LÃ¸ken and Mogstad (forthcoming) for an analysis of the 1993 paternity leave quota.

In our analysis, we focus on the six expansions in paid leave between 1987 and 1992.
are several reasons for this choice.

There

First, this allows us to analyze long term outcomes, such as

children's high school graduation rates and parent's long-term labor force attachment. Second, this
period gives us a total increase of 17 weeks of paid leave, providing a natural comparison to the
initial 18 weeks introduced in 1977. Finally, this is the period before the reforms started to set aside
specic quotas for fathers, which would add a new layer of complexity. While virtually all eligible
mothers take leave, not all eligible fathers do, even after the introduction of the father quotas.
The various reforms determined benets based on the birthdate of the child. For the 1987 reform,
parents with children born after May 1st 1987 were eligible for 20 weeks of paid parental leave while
parents whose children were born before were eligible for just 18 weeks. Subsequent expansions were
introduced with the following date cutos: July 1st 1988: 2 additional weeks, April 1st 1989: 2
additional weeks, May 1st 1990: 4 additional weeks, July 1st 1991: 4 additional weeks, and April

10

1st 1992: 3 additional weeks.

In addition to the birth cutos, paid parental leave benets were contingent on the mother
working at least 6 of the last 10 months before birth. Earnings in the prior 10 months needed to
exceed the substantial gainful activity threshold (approximately $12,500 in the year 2010).
The parental leave system is universal, simple, and well-known (including details about eligibility,
benet amounts, and the application process). To apply for parental leave benets, parents must
inform their employers and submit a joint application to a Social Security Administration eld oce
at least six weeks before the pregnancy due date.

2.2 Data
Our analysis employs several data sources that we can link through unique identiers for each
individual. This gives us a rich longitudinal database that covers every resident starting in 1967.
For each year, it contains individual demographic information and unique identiers that allow us to
match spouses and parents to their children. The data on parental leave comes from social security

10 Starting with the 1989 reform, parents were given the option of taking 80% earnings replacement and 20% more
weeks of paid leave. Since job protection extends for a year, at the margin it should be the same to take extra weeks
at 80 % coverage or 100 % coverage and additional weeks as unpaid leave.

7

registers that contain complete records for all individuals from 1992 onwards. One advantage of our
data is that we can study a wide variety of parents, child and family outcomes.
For mothers and fathers we focus on outcomes related to annual earnings and transfers, as the
Norwegian data does not include a measure of hours. Income is measured as total pension-qualifying
earnings and transfers reported in the tax registry. This individual-specic measure includes labor
earnings and all taxable transfers including sickness benets, unemployment benets and parental
leave payments. We construct a measure of whether mothers work after birth based on whether they
have positive labor earnings. We also look directly at earnings after the reforms. For both mothers
and fathers we construct two long term outcomes: total years of employment up to 14 years after
the reform and the annuity of income up to 14 years after each reform.
The outcomes we study for children are the written exam taken at the end of junior high school
and dropout rates from high school. The written exam is important for determining placement into
high school, and must be taken by all students. The exam subject rotates and can be in either math,
Norwegian or English. High school dropouts are dened as children not obtaining a three year high
school diploma by age 20. Due to age and survey restrictions, we do not have dropout status for the
1992 reform.
For family outcomes we examine combined family income, marriage patterns and fertility. We
measure long-term marital stability by observing whether a couple is divorced 14 years after the
reform, conditional on being married the year before the reform. We also look at whether a couple
is married 14 years later, given that they were not married the year before the reform. Lastly, we
look at completed fertility, dened as the cumulative number of children born to a mother 14 years
after the reform.
One of the key advantages of our dataset is that we can address the cost side of parental leave, as
well as its distributional eects. We can measure the amount of taxes a couple pays in the 14 years
after the program to see if the program is self-funding in the long run due to increased female labor
force participation or earnings. We can likewise measure the future benets from other programs a
family receives in the long run, including the universal child allowance, the family allowance which

8

is targeted to single parents, and disability insurance. With these variables, we can compare the

11

annuity of costs to the annuity of benets.

Since we do not observe hours, we cannot directly observe which parents are eligible for paid
leave according to the rules described in the previous section. We therefore predict eligibility using
labor earnings the year before birth.

We dene eligibility for mothers as having earnings above

the substantial gainful activity level, described in the previous section, in the year prior to birth.
Eligibility increases over time as more women enter the labor market. For example in 1987 about
70% of women are eligible, but by 1992, 76% of women are eligible. We limit our estimation sample
to those mothers who are predicted to be eligible.
There is a tradeo between using too strict of an earnings requirement and excluding parents
from our sample who were in fact eligible, and using a less strict earnings requirement and including
parents who actually were ineligible. While including ineligible parents may increase the residual
variation and thus the standard errors in the RD estimation, excluding eligible parents may aect

12

the external validity of our results.

By using a fairly weak earnings requirement in the prediction

of eligibility, we assign more weight to the generalizability of our results.
The nal variable needed for our analysis is take up of parental leave. The exact amount of paid
leave taken by each parent and the amount of the benet is directly observed from 1992 onwards.
For prior years, we assume that paid leave has a take up rate of 100% for mothers (with no take up
for fathers). This assumption is supported both by survey evidence (Carneiro, LÃ¸ken and Salvanes
2011) and the fact that observed take up for the 1992 reform is close to universal for mothers and
close to zero for fathers. To calculate the amount of unpaid leave, we follow Carneiro, LÃ¸ken and

13

Salvanes (2011) and impute days of unpaid leave using information on yearly earnings.

Later in

the paper, we verify this method by comparing the imputed estimates for 1992 to the actual data

11 See Blundell, Graber and Mogstad (2012) for a description of the Norwegian tax-transfer system. For all annuities,
we use an annual discount rate of 2.3%.
12 As long as eligibility cannot be manipulated, the internal validity of the RD estimates are unaected by the
exclusion of ineligibles.
13 Specically, we impute pre-birth monthly income by dividing earnings the year before the reform by 12. Then we
calculate total earnings in the year of the reform and the following three years after, and divide this by pre-reform
monthly income. This yields a measure of the number of days of unpaid leave during the rst 36 months after birth.
For this imputation to work, the assumption is that pre-reform earnings are a good approximation for maternal
potential post-birth earnings (the earnings she would have received had she not gone on unpaid leave), adjusted for
ination.

Appendix Table A1 provides summary statistics for the variables dened in this section, separately for each of the six reform years.

3 Identication
3.1 Regression Discontinuity Design
While we analyze six dierent expansions in paid leave, in each case we use a similar identication
strategy. To make things concrete, we focus the discussion on the 1992 reform. The discontinuity
we exploit arises from the reform being contingent on the birthdate of the child. Parents of children
born after April 1, 1992 were entitled to 35 weeks of parental leave while those with a child born
before this cuto could only receive 32 weeks. The reduced form model for our RD design can be

14

implemented by the following equation:

y = Î± + 1[t â¥ c](gl (t â c) + Î») + 1[t < c]gr (c â t) + e

eect of the reform on outcomes. To get the average eect of the extra weeks of paid leave,

Î»

needs

to be scaled by the jump in the take up of parental leave at around the cuto from a rst-stage RD
regression. For 1992, when actual take up is observed, we can estimate this rst stage. For earlier
years, this is not possible.

However, since take up of parental leave benets for mothers is close

to 100% in 1992 and survey data suggests the same holds true from the beginning of the program
(Carneiro, LÃ¸ken and Salvanes, 2011), the ITT estimate should be close to the average eect. For
the remainder of the paper, therefore, we focus on the ITT estimates.

14 See Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and Lee and Lemieux (2010) for details on the implementation and assessment
of RD designs.

3.2 Threats to Identication
3.2.1

Strategic timing of births

The validity of our RD design requires that individuals cannot manipulate the assignment variable,
which is the child's birthdate.

If date of birth cannot be timed in response to the reform, the

aggregate distribution of the assignment variable should be continuous around the cuto date.
There is little opportunity to strategically time conception, as the implementation dates for
the reforms have been announced less than nine months in advance. The national budgets which
propose the parental leave reforms are generally introduced in the fall and passed by parliament in
December of the same year. Therefore, mothers giving birth close to the cutos, which occurred in
the spring and summer, were already pregnant before the announcement of the reform. Furthermore,
as discussed in Section 2.1, the month of implementation varied from reform to reform, so the exact
timing would be hard to predict.
While strategic timing of conception is unlikely, it is still possible that mothers with due dates
close to the cuto date could postpone induced births and planned cesarean sections. In contrast
to current births practices in the U.S., the vast majority of births in Norway during the time of our
reforms were spontaneous vaginal deliveries. In 1993, the c-section rate was 12% (with 59% of these
being emergency operations) and only 12% of vaginal deliveries were induced (Folkehelseinstituttet,

15

http://mfr-nesstar.uib.no/mfr).

Therefore, this type of manipulation is less likely than it would

be in the U.S. setting (Dickert-Conlin and Chandra, 1999).
Figure 3 and Appendix Figure A1 graphically conrm there is no systematic eect from the
reforms on the distribution of fertility around the cutos. While there are some seasonal patterns
in the number of births, and a small jump in 1992, the reforms in general show no systematic evidence that births are strategically delayed. Nonetheless, to avoid the possibility that some births in
our sample are strategically delayed, we report robustness results which exclude the week immediately before and the week immediately following the cuto date. As we will show, excluding these
observations does not materially aect our ndings.

15 This contrasts with a c-section rate of 33% and an induction rate of 23% in the U.S. in 2011 (National Vital
Statistics Reports, Births: Final Data for 2011, Vol. 62, no. 1, June 28, 2013).

3.2.2

Eligibility

Another threat to our identication strategy is that the announcement of the reform could cause a
change in eligibility around the cuto date. If it did, then restricting the sample to eligibles could
bias the estimates. As explained above, we predict eligibility based on annual earnings in the year
prior to childbirth.

It is possible that mothers' earnings could respond to the announcement of

the reform. Recall, however, that predicted eligibility of mothers who have a child in the window
surrounding the reform is based on annual earnings in the prior year. As the reforms were usually
announced in December, it leaves the mother with only one month in which to increase her earnings
enough to become eligible by our denition. Given this short time frame, there is limited scope for
mothers to manipulate predicted eligibility status.
Figure 4 graphically illustrates there is no measurable change in predicted eligibility of mothers
around the cut-o date. While there is some seasonal variation in earnings and thus in predicted
eligibility, there is no jump in the fraction of predicted eligible mothers around the discontinuity,
a nding which is conrmed with an RD regression in Table 1.

Appendix Figure A2 and Table

1 show no signicant eligibility changes for the other reform years, except for 1991. But in 1991,
the estimate is actually negative, which is the opposite direction from what would be expected if
mothers were manipulating their eligibility.

3.2.3

Covariate balance

If families time date of birth or change eligibility status in response to the reform, then we would
expect to see changes in the distribution of pre-determined characteristics of the parents around the
reform dates. Table 1 shows that there is little evidence to support this, both for the 1992 reform
as well as for other reforms. Out of of the 24 estimates, 3 are signicant at the 10% level or less,
which is not much more than would be expected by chance. More importantly, the point estimates
are small in magnitude and our RD estimates barely move when we include the characteristics in
the regressions.

4 Results
A key advantage of RD is that results can be presented graphically, which make identication of the
estimates more transparent. However, given the large number of outcomes we analyze, we cannot
feasibly show graphs for every reform. Therefore, we rst present results graphically for the 1992
reform in the paper. Results for the other expansions in parental leave are presented in table form,
with graphs relegated to the Online Appendix.

4.1 First stage
The 1992 reform increased the number of paid weeks of parental leave by three, changing the
entitlement from 32 weeks to 35 weeks. Figure 5a displays the number of days of paid leave taken
by mothers in a window surrounding the reform.

The graph includes births three months before

and three months after the reform. In the graph, the birth date of the child has been normalized
with the cuto date of April 1, 1992 being labeled as zero. Each point on the graph is the average
number of paid leave days taken by mothers over a one week birth interval. There is a sharp jump
in the number of days of paid leave at the birth cuto date.
To obtain a RD estimate, we adopt the following specication for this rst stage regression and
for subsequent reduced form regressions.

We use daily data, include linear trends in birth day

on each side of the discontinuity and employ triangular weights. To gain precision, we also include
(pre-determined) control variables for mother's and father's years of education, mother's and father's
age and age squared, parent's county of residence, marital status prior to birth and gender of the
child. The estimated jump in this rst stage regression is 22.7 days (s.e. = 2.7), which corresponds
closely to the 3 week increase stipulated by the 1992 reform. This estimate conrms survey evidence
suggesting 100% take up by mothers of the entire amount of paid leave benets.
As mentioned previously, we only observe actual days of paid leave starting in 1992.

In the

results which follow, we therefore focus on reduced form estimates since we lack a rst stage for
earlier reforms. However, since take up is likely to have been close to 100%, these ITT estimates
should be very close to the average treatment eects in magnitude.

13

4.1.1

Crowd out of unpaid leave

An important question is whether an increase in the number of paid leave days reduces the number
of unpaid leave days. If so, then the intention of the reforms to increase the amount of time parents
spend with children would only be partially achieved. Moreover, if the unpaid leave decreases as
paid leave increases, there would be important income eects associated with the introduction of
the reforms, as total income (labor earnings plus leave benets) would rise after the reform.
Figure 5b graphs the fraction of mothers taking unpaid leave based on the birth date of their
child. There is no evidence of any change in unpaid leave as a result of the reform. Table 2 presents
RD estimates for the 1992 reform as well as the other expansion. All of the estimates are close to
zero and statistically insignicant. Unlike much of the previous research, we are able to hone in on
the counterfactual to paid leave because there is no evidence of crowd out of unpaid leave and there
was 100% income replacement.

This helps us interpret the expansions to paid parental leave as

increases in the amount of time spent at home versus work, holding family income constant. Since
there was almost no child care coverage for children under the age of 2 during this period (Mogstad
and Havnes, 2011), the counterfactual to parental care is usually informal care, including relatives
and nannies.
The fact that there is no crowd out of unpaid leave makes our results easier to interpret compared
to prior research in other countries. Indeed, one possible explanation for why much of the previous
literature either nds no eect or a negative eect of paid leave on child development is that there
could be osetting eects from a mother's increased time at home versus a reduction in family
income.

4.1.2

Child achievement and schooling

One of the main arguments made for paid parental leave, and maternity leave in particular, is that
it will have a positive impact on child development. The logic is that by reducing the amount of
time spent at work, parents will have more time to invest in their children. However, whether this is
true is controversial. The existing research on how maternal employment aects children's outcomes

14

is inconclusive, in part because it is dicult to control for the self-selection of mothers who choose
to work and in part because shocks to employment usually coincide with large changes to income
which could also aect child development.
The Norwegian parental leave setting is ideal to study how maternal employment in the rst year
of life aects later child outcomes, as it does not suer from the same deciencies as most of the
prior studies. First, since take up is essentially 100% and the RD design generates variation which
is as good as random around the cuto, there is no self selection into which eligible mothers take
more versus less paid leave after a reform. Of course, the estimates are only internally valid for the
group of eligible mothers, but this is an important and sizable group (approximately three-fourths of
all mothers). Second, the previous subsection revealed there is no crowd out of unpaid leave, which
means the reforms changed the amount of time mothers spent working, but did not aect family
resources in the short run.

As we show in the next subsection, the reforms did not signicantly

change family resources (including income from all sources, and not just the mother's labor income)
in the long run either. In short, this means that we have an exogenous change to maternal labor
supply during the rst year after birth, holding family income xed.
We test for eects on two long-term outcomes related to a child's long-term development: written
exams taken at the end of middle school (9th grade) and whether the child graduates from high
school. The exam taken at the end of middle school is important for placement into high school.
The scores range from 1 to 6, with a standard deviation approximately equal to 1. Figure 6a plots
the average exam grade based on a child's birth date in a window surrounding the 1992 reform.
Although exam scores are somewhat higher for children born earlier in the year, there is no jump in
average scores at the reform cuto date. Looking at Table 3, there is similarly little evidence that
expansions in paid leave aects exam scores for the other reforms. The eect sizes are close to zero
and only for the 1990 reform is the estimate signicant. But the sign is negative, which if taken
literally, suggests that increased parental leave harms a child academically.
Our next child outcome is whether a child drops out of high school. Because children born in
1992 have not yet had a chance to graduate from high school by the end of our data sample, we

15

cannot show a graph for this year. But we can report results for the other ve reforms, which we
do in column 2 of Table 3. The RD estimates are close to zero, indicating no eect of paid leave
on high school graduation. These last results stand in stark contrast to those of Carneiro, LÃ¸ken
and Salvanes (2011), who nd that the 1977 introduction of 18 weeks of paid leave and extension
of job protection from 12 weeks to one year decreased high school dropout rates by a statistically
signicant 2.7 percentage points.

4.1.3

Labor market outcomes

Another primary motivation for government leave programs is the claim that it will ease the transition of mothers back to work after the birth of a child and thereby promote increased attachment
to the labor market over the long run.

We graphically examine these claims for the 1992 reform

in Figure 6, panels (b) - (d). There is no visual evidence that mothers have an increased rate of
returning to work two years after the birth of their child.
increased labor market attachment in the long run.

There is also little visual evidence of

Total years of employment and the annuity

of income over the next 14 years are unaected by the 3 week increase in paid leave. The results
shown graphically for 1992 are not unique to that reform. Table 4 looks at the same outcomes for
all 6 reforms. While a few of the 24 coecients are signicant at the 10% level, the magnitudes are
relatively small.
When we look at father's long term labor market attachment, we similarly nd little evidence of
an eect, either graphically for 1992 in Figure 6, panels (e) and (f ), or for any of the other reform
years in Table 4. None of the 12 coecient estimates are statistically signicant.
The hope of many proponents of paid leave expansions is that they would promote more within
family gender equality in terms of labor force attachment. Panels (g) and (h) in Figure 6 and Table
5 reveal that the ratio of male to female employment and the ratio of male and female income
annuities in the long run (14 years after) did not generally change in response to the reforms. One
coecient is signicant at the ten percent level, but there is no obvious pattern for the remaining 11
insignicant coecients. Since these extensions in paid leave increased the amount of time women

16

spent at home with newborn children, but did not aect men's leave taking, the reforms had the
likely eect of widening the male-female childcare gap, at least in the rst year of a child's life.

4.1.4

Family structure

We nally turn to outcomes related to family structure.

An additional benet often claimed for

parental leave is that it supports and strengthens families. In panels (i) - (k) of Figure 6 we look at
a variety of family outcomes for the 1992 reform. The 1992 reform had a small eect on completed
fertility over the next 14 years. What about marital outcomes? Many Norwegians are not married at
the birth of their child. Therefore, we can examine whether the reform increased entry into marriage
or decreased exits out of marriage. We nd a small eect for increased entry into marriage, but no
eect for divorce in 1992.
Table 5 reveals that the two marginally signicant eects (at the 10% signicance level) found
for the 1992 reform appear to be due to sampling variability. None of the family structure estimates
for the other reform years are signicant, and the signs of the coecients do not follow a consistent
pattern, with a mixture of positive and negative coecients. Our reading of the evidence as a whole
is that the extensions to paid leave did little to encourage fertility or stabilize marriage.

4.2 Robustness
Before moving on, we rst present robustness results.

Since there are many reforms, we show

robustness for the 1992 reform; the results for other reform years are similarly robust. We begin
with a series of specication checks in Appendix Table A2, re-estimating the full set of outcomes
(i) omitting control variables, (ii) using separate quadratic trends on each side of the discontinuity
instead of linear trends, (iii) and with a 1 week donut around the discontinuity. In each case, the
results are remarkably robust, and continue to point towards little eect of the reforms on our long
list of outcomes.
We next examine whether our results are sensitive to dierent window widths.

Our baseline

estimates use a window of 90 days on either side of the birth cuto date. In Appendix Table A3 we

17

try a wider window of 120 days and a narrower window of 60 days. The results are similar regardless
of window width, although as expected, the standard errors increase when the window is smaller.
An alternative to using a global estimator for RD is to use local linear regression. This has the
advantage of being less inuenced by outliers far away from the discontinuity. We report on this
nal robustness check in Appendix Table A4. Whether we use a bandwidth of 30 or 60 days, the
results are similar to our baseline estimates.

5 Costs versus Benets
To evaluate the argument for paid parental leave, costs and benets must be compared on a per
dollar basis. We begin by discussing the costs of the program, and then translate the benet per
reform estimates from the prior section into benets per dollar spent.

5.1 Costs
The long-run costs of paid maternity leave depend not only on direct program expenditures, but also
on any changes in future tax payments or social benet receipt. Starting with the 1992 reform as an
example, Figure 7 plots the RD graphs associated with expenditures, taxes and benet payments
per participant. As expected due to the strong take up of the extra weeks allowed by the reform,
program expenditures jump discontinuously around the reform cuto in panel (a). Table 6 estimates
that expenditures rise by over $2,100 per mother. Since this was a three week reform, expenditures
amount to an average transfer of roughly $140 for each workday taken o by mothers.
However, there could be indirect revenue eects from paid leave. For example, if paid leave causes
mothers to work more in the future, this increase in revenues could help nance the leave program.
Panel (b) in Figure 7 graphs the annuity of taxes paid for 15 years, starting with the year of the
birth (year 0). Parental leave benets are fully taxable at the individual level, so a portion of the
leave payments is returned to the government in the form of higher tax payments in the year of the
birth. However, there is also a reduction in taxes collected by the government due to the foregone
earnings of the mother while on leave. Since there is 100% earnings replacement and empirically no

18

evidence of crowd out in unpaid leave, these two tax eects largely cancel each other out in the year
of the birth. There is also little evidence of a sizable increase in tax receipt over the next 14 years.
Similarly, there could be future indirect costs if paid leave changes participation in other social
welfare programs.

We nd no evidence that transfer payments increase over the 15 year period

starting with the year of the birth.

This null eect is visually shown in panel (c) and veried

numerically in column 3 of Table 7. Hence, the total cost of the program per participant is close
to the program expenditure amount, as future taxes and transfers are largely unaected. Appendix
Figures A15 to A17 reveal similar expenditure, tax and transfer patterns for the other reform years,
which is perhaps not surprising given the results on family labor supply found in the previous section.
The total cost of the program depends on the number of participating mothers.

In 1992, for

example, 45,682 eligible women gave birth and participated in the program, at an estimated average
cost of roughly $2,100 per mother. If a similar number of mothers continue to take paid leave in the
future, this implies the yearly cost of the leave program rose by almost $100 million per year due to
the 3 week expansion in paid benets.
To put the magnitude of the program in perspective, consider the cumulative costs of the initial
reform and all of the leave expansions. Based on all the reforms we study, we estimate a one week
increase in paid leave costs taxpayers $687 dollars (in 2010 dollars) on average per birth.

The

initial 1977 reform gave mothers 18 weeks of paid leave and 1 year of job protection. The series of
expansions in paid leave we study in this paper expanded paid leave by 17 weeks.

Based on the

number of births to eligible mothers in 1992, the annual cost of providing 35 weeks of paid leave is
over $1 billion per year (in 2010 dollars). This represents almost 0.5% of GDP. Whether the initial
18 weeks is worth the roughly $565 million in annual costs can be debated, since Carneiro, LÃ¸ken
and Salvanes (2011) nd some benets associated with the initial reform. But the expansions nearly
doubled this annual cost, without any corresponding changes in a broad range of child, family and
gender equality outcomes.

These expansionary costs imply a considerable increase in taxes, at a

cost to economic eciency.

19

5.2 Benets per $1,000 spent
In the previous section, the potential benets of paid parental leave were measured per reform. Some
of the leave extensions were 2 weeks, while others were 3 or 4 weeks. In this section, we present the
results for each reform in term of benets per $1,000 of program expenditure. These comparisons
are presented graphically in Figure 8.
As an example, consider Figure 8a which plots the eect on academic achievement at the end
of 9th grade for each reform, standardized per $1,000 of expenditures. The x-axis measures weeks
of paid leave, with the vertical red lines indicating each of the 6 extensions in paid leave.

The

horizontal black lines visually present the standardized estimates, while the dashed lines represent
95% condence intervals.

The graph makes clear that the reforms had little eect on children's

academic achievement.
The other graphs in Figure 8 present similar illustrations of eect sizes per $1,000 spent for
other outcomes. One advantage of presenting results in this manner is that it is easy to compare
the eect of earlier reforms to later reforms. Modest expansions when a child is still young could
be worthwhile, even if later, larger expansions are not. For example, one might think the benets
of breastfeeding are more important when an infant is less than 6 months old but that this benet
fades out over time. Similarly, one might think the longer a mother stays out of the labor force, the
less will be her future attachment to the labor market. However, even modest expansions, from 18
to 20 weeks or from 20 to 22 weeks, have no signicant eect on outcomes. The estimates are all
close to zero and generally insignicant.
The rst column of Table 7 presents the eect per $1,000 spent, averaged over all six reforms.
None of the estimated average eects are large or statistically signicant, even though the averaging
generally results in smaller standard errors. Even if the average eect is statistically insignicant, one
could imagine that the cumulative eect of all the reforms adds up to something which is signicant.
This is not the case. Column 2 in Table 7 shows that none of the cumulative eects are signicant

16

at the 5 percent signicance level.

16 There have been small changes in the composition of which mothers take leave over our sample period. Reweighting
the results by observable characteristics to adjust for this does not materially aect our ndings.

20

6 Redistribution
Since there are no measurable benets associated with extensions to paid leave, but large costs to
taxpayers, it is important to consider the distributional eects of the program. Somewhat surprisingly, little attention has been paid in the previous literature to the redistributional eects of this
social program.
As discussed previously, not all mothers are eligible for paid leave, since a requirement is that
mothers have a minimum level of labor market earnings prior to the child's birth. Table 8 compares
eligible versus ineligible mothers on a variety of dimensions. Mothers who are eligible for parental
leave benets are more educated, are married to higher educated men, and are more likely to
be natives compared to ineligibles. Eligible mothers also have substantially higher family income
compared to ineligible mothers, with disposable income being 60% higher in the year prior to birth.
This income gap persists over time, with family income for eligibles being almost 20% higher on
average compared to ineligible mothers in 2010.
The distributions of family income for eligible and ineligible mothers are presented in Figure
9. The rst graph plots the distributions for family income in the year prior to the child's birth.
The graph makes clear that that paid parental leave makes transfers to relatively well-o mothers.
Not only is the mean of the eligible distribution farther to the right, but the left tail of the income
distribution has a much larger mass for ineligibles. Twenty-ve percent of the ineligible distribution
has family income below $25,000 compared to only 10% of the eligible distribution. In addition, only
16% of the ineligible distribution has family income above $60,000 compared to 58% of the eligible
distribution. These are large distributional disparities.
Even within the group of eligible mothers, the parental leave program is regressive. Leave benets
are tied to prior earnings and women with higher earnings reside in families with higher income.
Since the program gave 100% income replacement up to a high threshold, the amount of the transfer
increases with family income on average. The black dots in Figure 10 plot the pre-tax value of the
leave transfer to mothers versus disposable income, dened as the sum of parent's labor income
plus taxes and transfers. Both eligible and ineligible mothers are included in the graph. The pre-

21

tax transfer is highly regressive, with families earning less than $25,000 receiving $10,560 in paid
leave on average compared to families earning greater than $60,000 receiving $21,349 on average. A
considerable part of this regressivity is undone by Norway's progressive tax system, as leave benets
are fully taxable at the individual level. But as the grey dots in Figure 10 show, even after taxes,
the program continues to favor middle and upper income families, with families earning more than
$60,000 receiving roughly 75% more in after-tax leave benets compared to families earning less
than $25,000.
The dierences in income between ineligibles and eligibles are even larger when comparing eligible
mothers to the relatively poor men and women who never have children. The second panel of Table
8 documents that family income in 2010 is almost two and a half times larger in eligible families
compared to childless individuals.
The comparisons in this section make clear that paid parental leave has regressive redistribution
properties. The program makes regressive transfers both from ineligibles to eligibles and within the
group of eligible mothers.

Since there is no crowd out of unpaid leave, the extra leave payments

amount to a pure leisure transfer to middle and upper income families at the expense of the least
well o in society.

7 Conclusion
Paid parental leave has gained greater salience in the past few decades as mothers have increasingly
entered the workforce. Indeed, the median number of weeks of paid leave among OECD countries
was 14 in 1980, but had risen to 42 by 2011. The usual arguments for paid leave are that there are
important social goals or market failures addressed by the program. However, empirical evidence on
the benets and costs of paid leave is scarce and many key questions are still unanswered. First, does
paid leave increase available parental time with children, or does it simply crowd out unpaid leave?
Second, what eect does paid leave have on a broad range of child, parent and family outcomes?
Third, how do any benets compare relative to costs? And nally, are there progressive or regressive
distributional eects?

22

We answer these questions in the context of Norway's parental leave program, focusing on parents'
responses to a series of policy reforms which expanded paid leave from 18 to 35 weeks (without
changing the length of job protection). Our rst empirical result is that none of the reforms seem to
crowd out unpaid leave. Since income replacement was 100% for most women, the reforms caused
an increase in mother's time spent at home after birth, without a reduction in family income. This
allows for a clean estimate of the eect of parental time on child and family outcomes, as there
are no income eects to worry about.

Second, the expansions had little eect on a wide variety

of outcomes, including children's school outcomes, parental earnings and participation in the labor
market in the short or long run, completed fertility, marriage or divorce. Third, paid parental leave
makes regressive transfers both from ineligibles to eligibles and within the group of eligible mothers.
Since there was no crowd out of unpaid leave, the extra leave benets amounted to a pure leisure
transfer. Finally, the reforms extending paid leave had little impact on parents' future tax payments
and benet receipt. As a result, the large increases in public spending on parental leave imply a
considerable increase in taxes, at a cost to economic eciency.
Taken together, our nding suggest the case for extensions to paid maternity leave must rest on
arguments other than improvements in observable dimensions of public benets, redistribution or
market failures. In a time of harsh budget realities, our ndings are particularly relevant for countries
that are considering future expansions or contractions in the duration of paid leave. One can argue
whether a baseline level of paid parental leave or job protection is worth the cost. But the case for
extended paid leave periods, which are prevalent in OECD countries, is weak. One would have to
argue there are benets not captured in the relatively rich set of outcome variables we look at. For
example, our empirical strategy only identies the responses of parents with children born around the
time of the reforms, which might not be externally valid for parents having children in later periods.
In a long-run perspective, when rms might adjust to the extensions of parental leave and women
might change their investments in human capital and fertility behavior, the eects of the program
could potentially be stronger.

Unfortunately, costs and benets of such long-run adjustments, if

they exist, are dicult to verify. By way of comparison, the opportunity costs to funding parental

23

leave are substantial and veriable: a growing body of evidence show that government subsidies
to early education can yield high returns in the short and long run, particularly for disadvantaged

17

children.

Figure 3: Fertility histogram, 1992 reform

The histogram uses one week bins; the bin starting at 0 includes births
in the rst week post reform.
Note:

Figure 4: Eligibility, 1992 reform

Each observation is the average fraction of eligible mothers in a
one-week bin based on the birth date of the child. The dashed vertical line
denotes the reform cuto date, which has been normalized to zero. The
solid lines are estimated using a linear regression based on daily individual
level data using triangular weights. The scale of the y-axis is +/-.5
standard deviations of the mean outcome.

Figure 9: Distribution of disposable family income the year prior to birth, for eligible and ineligible
mothers, 1987-1992

Sample of eligible and ineligible mothers aged 25-40
giving birth during the period 1987-1992. Disposable income
is calculated as the sum of parents' combined labor income,
parental leave benets, non-taxable transfers, unemployment
benets and sick leave minus taxes paid and is measured the
year before birth. Disposable income has been converted into
year 2010 dollars. The top one percentile of disposable family
income is excluded from the graph. Each bin in the histogram
is $2,500 wide.
Notes:

Figure 10: Average value of paid leave transfer by disposable family income, before and after tax,
1987-1992

Sample consists of all mothers who gave birth between 1987-1992.
Disposable income is calculated as the sum of parents' combined labor income, parental leave benets, non-taxable transfers, unemployment benets
and sick leave minus taxes paid and is measured the year prior to birth.
Disposable income has been converted into year 2010 dollars. The top one
percentile of disposable family income is excluded from the graph. Each
observation in the graph plots the average value of the leave transfer for a
$5,000 interval.
