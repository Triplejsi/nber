An Evaluation of Recent Evidence on Stock Market Bubbles

ABSTRACT

Several recent studies have attributed
volatility to self-fulfilling expectations.

Such an explanation is

unattractive to many since it allows allocations that need bear no
particular relation to those implied

market fundamentals. We examine the
studies and find (i) that all of the
interpreted as evidence of model

by the economist's standard kit of
evidence presented in some of these
bubble evidence can equally well be

misspecification and (ii) that a slight

extension of standard econometric
methods points very strongly toward model
misspecification as the actual

reason for the failure of simple models of

market fundamentals to explain asset price volatility.

I. Introduction
The topic of asset-price bubbles has
recently received a large amount
of professional attention. The theoretical
work is exemplified by that of
Obstfe].d and Rogoff
(1983), Tirole (1985), Diba
and Grossman (l985a), and
Hamilton and Whiteman
(1985), while the empirical
work is exemplified by
that of Burmejster and Wall
(1982), Flood, Garber and Scott
(1984), Quah
(1985), Meese (1986), West
(1984, l9SSa, l985b), Diba and Grossman(l985b)
Woo (1984), Scott (1985b), and Okina (1985).

second is the ktil*le, which
is defined to be what is left after market
fundamentals have been
removed from price. Bubbles
may be thought of as the
part of price due to
self-fulfilling prophecy.

Two general types of empirical work have been
interpreted as being
useful in addressing the
question of whether bubbles
are important for asset
price determination. The first follows the bubbles
test of Flood and Garber
(1980) and the variance bounds
work of Leroy and Porter (1981) in attempting
to forecast the indefinite
future of market fundamentals. The second
follows some of the variance
bounds work of SMiler (1982) and Grossman and
Shiller (1981) by examining market fundamentais

market price. In the Section III of this paper we argue that the latter
method, which was not designed explicitly for bubble research, gives no
information about bubbles. The results of such tests do, however, provide
pertinent information regarding model specificationJ
In the remaining sections of the paper we discuss and extend some of

the recent empirical work that is theoretically well-designed to give
information about asset-price bubbles in aggregate stock markets. This
includes some recent work by West (1984, 1985a), Diba and Grossman (l985b),
and Quah (1985).

The data sets used by Quah (1985) and by Diba and Grossman (l985b) are
either identical to or are subsets of the data used by West (1984, 1885a),

which is the same as that used by Shiller (1981a). Further,

all of these

studies use an equilibrium condition to price assets that is based on the

Euler equations of a risk-neutral agent. Our empirical

results address the

adequacy of the risk-neutral specification in empirical bubble tests, and,
therefore, our results reflect on all of the studies.
After duplicating West's work, we extended it in two directions.

First, because of our concern about the time series stationarity of his
data, we performed his estimation using returns on stock portfolios. West
used the levels of real stock prices and dividends or their first

differences in his study. We found that the differences in inference
between using our specification and West's were actually quite minor. This

was puzzling for two reasons. West's specification requires the expected
real rate of return on the stock market to be constant.

Since variance

bounds tests based on that specification seem to us to indicate some form of
model misspeclfication, this representation was suspect.

Also, there is a

3

on a variety of assets move

indicating that expected rates of return

through time.2 Why, then, was West's

specification indicating such a different result?
One difference between the

variance bounds tests and West's Euler

equation tests involves the fact that the Euler equation methods
consider
only temporally adjacent periods, while the variance bounds
tests consider

widely separated periods. If the Euler equation is incorrect, it
may be

does not imply

Although the one-period specification error

strong rejection of the Euler equation, it is possible that

the compounded

one-period specificato errors that appear in variance
bounds tests could lead to a rejection of the model.
In order to investigate this

issue we iterated the Euler equation

to equate margins across

two nonadjacent periods, and we used West's data
and his methods to estimate the iterated Euler
equatiQn. The iterated Euler
equation was resoundingly
rejected by the data calling into question West's
interpretation of his results

as indicating evidence of stock market

bubbles.

An obvious potential

problem with West's model was his use of a risk-

neutral utility function that induces his linear
response to our misgivings about the

estimating equations. In

assumption of risk neutrality, we

to the results we find for risk neutrality -

marginally well only when margins for adjacent

equated. There is more substantial

the models when the iterated

evidence against

Euler equations equating margins for

4

nonadjacent periods are employed.3

We investigated the data in two additional ways. First, because the
theory deals with after-tax returns while the data we use contain only

before-tax returns, we tried to allow the estimation to tell us if
differential tax treatment of dividends and capital gains might be

responsible for the model's failure. The results of this part of the
investigation are inconclusive. There is some evidence that agents treat
dividends and capital gains differently. We also looked explicitly at
return forecasting equations. The risk neutral model implies that
forecasted one-period returns should be a constant equal to the inverse of

the subjective discount rate. We find that past (time-varying) dividendasset price ratios almost surely forecast returns, which we interpret as
strong evidence that the risk-neutral model is inappropriate.

Our research is reported in the following five sections. In Section II
we present a theoretical discussion of asset pricing in a utility-

maximizing framework. In this section we are explicit about our definition
of asset-price bubbles.

In Section III we show why studies of stock-price

variance bounds, which use a terminal stock market price in the way
suggested in much of the variance bounds literature, give information about

the adequacy of the underlying specification, but they do not give

information about asset-price bubbles. In Section IV we discuss potential
problems with interpretations of bubbles tests, and we lay out West's

proposed methodology. In Section V we report results concerning the
usefulness of the risk neutral utility function in developing bubbles test.

We also report some additional results on nonlinear utility functions, on
specifications that allow differential tax-treatment of dividends and

5

capital gains, and on the

ability of past data to forecast future stock

market returns. In Section vi we

attached to the sale of a unit
The second term on the right-

hand side of (9) is the expected utility gain

attached to the strategy of

holding a unit of the asset indefinitely and consuming only the stream of

dividends accruing to ownership of the asset. T1e current utility cost of
purchasing the asset is given by z.

Therefore, an agent can be at a

maximum with a buy-and-hold (forever) strategy only

if the first term on the

right-hand side of (9) is zero.
This example of an infinitely lived representative agent provides a
special case in which bubbles are not possible in equilibrium. The agent
knows that he will live forever, and he knows that everyone in the economy

is identical to him. In equilibrium the asset must be priced to be held by
the infinitely lived representative agent who must follow the buy-and-hold

strategy. The agent can be t an equilibrium only when the marginal utility
of what he gives up to buy the asset,

is equal to the expected value of

what he gets from holding the asset, E_1p1E(a+).

Therefore, in this

model, the combination of the agent's maximization and market equilibrium
give the implication that the first term in (9) must be zero. This
transversality condition arises as a necessary condition of the model, and
one way to test this model is to test the transversality condition.

The bubble process defined by (5) and (6) is consistent with the
model's Euler equation, but it is not consistent with the transversality

condition. The present value of the future marginal utility of the asset
price must go to zero as the discounting period goes to infinity as long as
the utility value of the asset payoffs is bounded above. The present value
of the expected future bubble, however, will not go to zero, since the

9

bubble is expected to

grow at the inverse of the discount factor.
Some models imply a
transversality condition that is inconsistent with
the presence of bubbles in asset prices. In
contrast, the theoretical
analysis of Tirole (1985) indicates
that other models
incorporating rational
expectations can be perfectly
consistent with asset price bubbles in some

circumstances.4 In our view, bubble tests

III. Bubbles and Variance Bounds Tests
The purpose of this section is to show that failure
of an asset pricing
model in certain variance
bounds tests gives no information about bubbles.
Such results are
correctly interpreted as
providing information about the
adequacy of the underlying model.
We conduct the argument using the model
developed in the previous
section. For this part of the argument we adopt
the Euler equation, (3), and the pricing function,
(7), which allows asset
price bubbles. The bubble,
if present, must follow the time series process
described in (5). In the rest of this section, for
brevity, we refer to the
marginal utility of the asset
price, z, simply as the asset price, and we
refer to the marginal
utility derived from the dividend paid to owners of
the asset,
as the dividend on. the
asset. This convention is not invoked
in later sections

The basic insights of the variance bounds literature
are that the
variance of an actual variable
must be greater than or equal to the variance

10

of its conditional expectation and that this latter variance must be greater
than or equal to the variance of a forecast based on a subset of the

information used by agents. To see how the existence of bubbles could lead
in theory to a violation of variance bounds, consider the ex post rational

price, which is defined to be the price that would prevail if agents knew
future market fundamentals with certainty and there were no bubbles.

The ex

post rational price is

Notice that ex post rational price is a theoretical construct, and although
it is subscripted with a t, it is neither in an agent's information set nor
is it in an econometrician's information set.

The theoretical relation that is the foundation of many variance bounds
tests is obtained by subtracting (7) from (10) and rearranging terms:

Suppose that somehow a researcher
could develop very good measurements
of the variance of the
market price,

ex post rational price, z', and of the variance of

z. Suppose further that it was found that

price had a smaller variance than

ex post rational

market price. Since the variance of both

Ut and b must be non-negative, such a finding could only be rationalized,
within the framework of the

model, by a positive conditional covariance

between the bubble and

z. Therefore, as long as the model is correct, and
as long as the variance of
ex post rational price and the variance of market
price are measured
appropriately, a finding of V(Z) > V(z') can be
interpreted as evidence of bubbles.

The difference between the

theoretical exercise described above and its

practical implementation arises in the construction of an observable

counterpart to z. Because it is
price since it depends on the
a related variable which

Since UT is the innovation in the present value of dividends between time T

depends on the evolution of the stochastic bubble between t and T from (6),
it is not orthogonal to time t information.

Notice what happens when (15) is solved for z, and the result is
substituted into (11). After slight rearrangement, one obtains

version of (16) and that of previous researchers is that we have allowed
explicitly for rational stochastic bubbles in our derivation.

asset price bubbles since (20) was derived in a model that allowed bubbles.
Research that does not use the terminal price as above in variance
bounds tests of stock price volatility, such as Leroy and Porter (1981),
could, in principle, find variance bounds violations attributable to

rational stock price bubbles. Of course, these models could also violate
variance bounds if misspecified in any of the ways mentioned above.

IV. Testinz for Bubbles
In the previous section we demonstrated that some volatility tests,
that were not originally proposed as bubble tests, are not well-designed

tests of bubbles. In this section we discuss some tests that were
conceived explicitly to test for bubbles. We also provide a warning about
the interpretation of such tests.

IV.A. A WarninR About &ibble Tests
In virtually all modern economic models, expectations of agents about
the future play an important role in decision making.

Empirical

implementation of these models is complicated by the fact that expectations

are not observable directly. The investigator must model agents'
expectations in terms of observable variables: he substitutes his model of
expectations for the unobservable true expectations.

Once the final model

of actual data is estimated, with the restrictions from expectations
imposed, inference can be carried out conditionally on having modeled

expectations correctly. If the model of expectations is flawed, incorrect
inference can result. This problem is particularly

their original bubble tests, and Hamilton

and Whiteman (1985) have recently also

addressed the problem. In later

work, Flood and Carber (1983) referred to agents' beliefs in possible
future alterations of the economic environment as process switching. We
adopt that terminology here.

Since dividend policy is arbitrary in simple models of the firm, the
problem of process switching seems particularly devastating here. By
working with over one hundred years of data from the Standard and Poor's
data set, Shiller and West tried to circumvent the problem in two ways.

First, they used a data set with a long intertemporal dimension. Second,
the data set is for a large aggregate of

18

There is also an important similarity in

these studies. In each case

the researchers desired to test the hypothesis

that bubbles are absent from

the data while estimating under the alternative

hypothesis that bubbles are

present. The Flood and Carber and the Buneiter and Wall studies both
attempt time series asymptotic tests of the null hypothesis that bubbles

are absent from the data. They desired to test the statistical
significance of the parameters associated with the bubble against the null
hypothesis that these parameters are zero.

The difficulty with such tests

is that the statistics used to test for bubbles must be derived under the

alternative hypothesis that allows for bubbles. It is well known that the
asymptotic distribution of test statistics in situations such as the
presence of bubbles (exploding regressors)

is difficult to derive and that

standard tests are almost certainly not applicable.5

Flood, Carber and Scott (1984) try to avoid the time series problem by

estimating with panel data. The conceptual experiment yielding the
asymptotic distributions involves letting the size of the cross section in
the panel become very large. and this would produce well-behaved asymptotic
parameter distributions in large samples if the cross-sectional errors
satisfy the appropriate orthogonali-ty

conditions. The problem in applying

this methodology is that the number of simultaneous hyperinflations

was not

actually very large. The size of the cross section in Flood, Garber and

Prompted by some ideas presented in Blanchard and Watson (1982), West
(1984, l985a, 1985b) developed bubble tests that circumvent the problems

associated with obtaining
limiting distributions

described above. West's

insight was to conduct

all estimation under the null hypothesis
of no
bubbles. Under the null, standard
asymptotic distribution
theory applies
for all parameter
estimates, and tests of the
no-bubbles hypothesis may be
conducted in large
samples using these distributions. The
nonstationarity
of bubbles affects
West's tests only

portion of our empirical

work involves extensions and
modifications of West's
work, we now present
a stylized version of his
methods. Also, since our research as well
as West's involves data from the
stock market, we discuss
the issues in the context of the example
examined
above. The goal of
West's research is to test the hypothesis
that every
element in the series
(br) is zero, where the series
Ib) contains the
bubble elements from
a specific model of
an asset price series.
The first step in
West's methodology is to estimate and test the
specification given in (3), the Euler
equation for adjacent periods.
West's methods require the investigator
to specify the agent's utility
function, and in most of
his work, he assumed a risk-neutral
representative

utility terms divide out of each side of (3) to yield

+

is the real price of the asset at time t+i and d÷ is the real

dividend paid by the asset at time t+i to purchasers of the asset at t+i-l.
The model provides no guidance to the researcher in determining the
appropriate deflator to convert nominal asset prices and nominal dividends

into real terms. West followed Shiller (1981) and deflated nominal stock
prices and nominal dividends by a producer price index.6

Wst examines four aspects of (3a) to determine its consistency with

the data. The first involves a specification test of the overidentifying
restrictions. West estimAted (3a) using Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method
of Moments (0MM), which is an instrumental variable technique that delivers

statistic. The second specification test involves examining serial
correlflion of the residuals using the procedures described in Pagan and

Hall (1983). The third test checks the stability of estimated coefficients
by testing for mid-sample shifts in the coefficients. The fourth way the
specification was examined involved checking the quality and reasonableness

of the estimated parameters. Are the standard errors

The steps in West's methodology contain an important sequential

aspect. Only if the first two steps deliver correct equations does the
third step test for bubbles. Formally,

the Euler equation and the dividend

forecasting equation. If either the Euler equation or the dividend

This methodology is applied by West (1984,

Second, we suspected that his

appropriate. Although West works with a long time series of
annual data,
which are considerably different
from the quarterly or monthly post-World
War II data in Hansen and
Singleton (1982, 1983), the strength of the
evidence against the constant real rate of return model
in post-war data
seems overwhelming. Third, we suspected that his data do
not satisfy the

V. New Empirical Analyses
The data we use consist of
associated real dividend

payments for two time series. The first set of
series is for the Standard
and Poor's data for the years 1871 1980, and

the second is for a modified Dow-Jones Index for the years 1928 Nominal magnitudes are deflated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics wholesale

price index. The stock price data are the daily averages for each January
and the dividends are those that accrue during a year.8
We first replicated the results in West's Table IA.

Since we were

concerned that first differencing the levels of the data would not be
sufficient to provide a stationary time

series process, we estimated the

Euler equation in return form using a set of instruments that ought to be
stationary in a growing real economy.

the return at time t+l.

We also employed a 0MM estimation using a constant and three lags of

the dividend-price ratio, dt/Pt as instruments.

The results are reported

in Table I. The usefulness of the instrument set, as measured by its
ability to predict the returns, is discussed later in this section.
Equations I and 5 in Table I report the results of estimating the Euler

equation of the risk neutral utility function. Our results are very
similar to those of West even though our instruments

are different and we

estimated the Euler equation in return form while he estimated either in
levels or in first differences.
The discount rate, p, is very precisely and very plausibly estimated.

The estimated value using the standard and Poor's data (specification 5)
with lagged dividend-price ratios as instruments

is 0.9155 with a standard

error of 0.0138. The estimate using the modified Dow-Jones data
(specification 1) is 0.9171 with a standard error of 0.0268. As West

mentions, the discount rate estimates are quite close to the inverse of the
