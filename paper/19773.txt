Unintended Consequences of LOLR Facilities: The Case of Illiquid Leverage

NBER Working Paper No. 19773
December 2013

ABSTRACT
While the direct effect of lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) facilities is to forestall the default of financial
firms that lose funding liquidity, an indirect effect is to allow these firms to minimize deleveraging
sales of illiquid assets. This unintended consequence of LOLR facilities manifests itself as excess illiquid
leverage in the financial sector, can make future liquidity shortfalls more likely, and can lead to an
increase in default risks. Furthermore, this increase in default risk can occur despite the fact that the
combination of LOLR facilities and reduced asset sales raises the prices of illiquid assets.
The behavior of U.S. broker-dealers during the crisis of 2007-2009 is consistent with the unintended
consequence just described. In particular, given the Federal Reserve’s LOLR facilities, broker-dealers
could afford to try to wait out the crisis. While they did reduce traditional measures of leverage to
varying degrees, they failed to reduce sufficiently their illiquid leverage, which contributed to their
failures or near failures.
Several mechanisms that might address this unintended consequence of LOLR facili-ties are explored:
condition LOLR access and terms on the financial health of borrowers; condition LOLR access and
terms on asset sales and deleveraging; and, especially, in-stead of supporting troubled financial firms,
open LOLR facilities to financially sound, potential buyers of illiquid assets.

Introduction

Since 2007, central banks worldwide have offered lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) facilities to private
financial institutions in unprecedented scope and scale. These facilities provide funding against
relatively illiquid assets in times of market stress so as to prevent downward spirals in which
balance sheet weaknesses beget asset fire sales, which beget further balance sheet weaknesses, etc.,
until the financial sector’s ruin devastates the real economy.
LOLR facilities are hardly a panacea, however. The ex-ante moral hazard of providing such
facilities in a crisis is well and widely recognized: financial institutions, knowing that authorities
will offer liquidity in a crisis, take too much liquidity risk from a societal perspective. In addition,
despite the ex-post societal benefits of LOLR facilities, the sense in which these facilities bail out
financial institutions generates considerable political fallout.
This subject of this paper is a less recognized moral hazard of LOLR facilities, which occurs
when these facilities are in operation. Consider the following exchange at Merrill Lynch’s earnings
call from the second quarter of 2008. Meredith Whitney, a well-known analyst at Oppenheimer,
asked John Thain, Chairman and CEO of Merrill Lynch, whether the firm could put its balance
sheet problems behind it by “hitting whatever cash bid... is out there” for its troubled assets. Mr.
Thain responded as follows:
We have not simply liquidated stuff at any price we could get. At some point some
of the return profiles that people want... you would not want us to sell the assets. We
will continue to sell assets but in a way that makes sense from generating returns to
our shareholders.1
Out of context, this response seems perfectly reasonable: the CEO of a financial institution
is promising to conduct asset sales so as to maximize shareholder returns. In context, however,
Mr. Thain’s statement is quite remarkable. Following the collapse of Bear Stearns in mid-March
2008, the Federal Reserve established unprecedented LOLR liquidity facilities, namely the Term
Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), to ease the
precarious funding conditions that were perceived to threaten the very survival of broker-dealers.

Merrill Lynch, Q2 Earnings Call, July 17, 2008

It would not be unreasonable to expect broker-dealers to use the respite provided by these facilities
to sell troubled assets gradually, i.e., to strengthen their balance sheets without dumping assets
in an individually and systemically harmful manner. Instead, while the Federal Reserve, and by
extension the U.S. taxpayer, stood ready to fund assets and assume whatever risks that entailed,
the CEO of a beneficiary of these LOLR facilities proclaimed that asset sales would be conducted
so as to generate returns for shareholders. Worse yet, Merrill Lynch’s delay in deleveraging its
balance sheet, made possible at least in part by LOLR facilities, was a factor contributing to its
demise as an independent firm in September 2008, a mere two months after Mr. Thain’s remarks.
The case of Merrill Lynch in July 2008 is only a single instance of a much wider phenomenon.
Whether considering the Federal Reserve’s set of LOLR programs in the U.S. during the ’07-’09
financial crisis, including traditional discount window lending, the Bank of Japan’s Funds Supplying Operation in ’09-’10, or the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) recent Long-Term Refinancing
Operations (LTRO), there is a concern that private financial institutions take advantage of central
bank funding programs by dragging their feet on deleveraging. With this motivation, this paper
argues, both theoretically and through a case study, that LOLR facilities as currently designed
can have the unintended consequence of reducing the extent to which financial firms delever and,
therefore, can actually increase these firms’ risks of default.
To establish its theoretical results, this paper constructs a model designed to capture the
plight of many banks and investment banks during the most recent crisis. In particular, a representative bank has borrowed short term to fund the purchase of long-term and relatively illiquid
assets. Then, due to market stress, these assets sell for less than their fundamental values and
have become difficult to finance.2 The bank, consequently, needs to delever, i.e., to sell some of its
assets, despite their being undervalued, so that the firm has enough funds on hand to redeem any
maturing debt that cannot be rolled over.
The central bank steps into this setting by offering to fund the illiquid asset at better terms
than those offered by private funding markets. The direct effect of such an LOLR facility, the
2

Broker-dealers normally rely on private markets to finance their positions, but these markets became severely
impaired in early 2008. Lenders of funds through repurchase agreements became increasingly cautious, worrying
both about the liquidation value of collateral and about the credit risk of counterparties. These lenders reacted by
increasing haircuts – reducing the cash they were willing to lend against a given amount of collateral – and by refusing
to lend at all against certain types of collateral. See, for example, Copeland, Martin and Walker (2011), Gorton and
Metrick (2012), and Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Orlov (2012).

“liquidity insurance effect,” is to forestall the default of a bank in all but the worst stress conditions. The indirect effect, however, the “moral hazard effect,” is to give the bank leeway to reduce
deleveraging sales of illiquid assets. In the simplest version of the model, where the price of the
illiquid asset is exogenous, the moral hazard effect not only exists, but dominates the liquidity insurance effect so that the LOLR facility actually increases the risk of a bank default. Furthermore,
the moral hazard effect can be particulary powerful for the weakest or most highly-levered banks.
The paper then considers a version of the model to account for the fact that the illiquid asset
price is actually determined endogenously, which has implications for any equilibrium conclusions
about the effects of LOLR facilities. More specifically, the model introduces a representative buyer
of the asset as a stand in for those less leveraged banks and investment banks, hedge funds, pension
funds, insurance companies, asset managers, etc., who are able to purchase distressed assets opportunistically in a crisis. The bank’s supply curve, or willingness to sell the illiquid asset, together
with the buyer’s demand curve, or willingness to buy the illiquid asset, combine to determine the
asset’s equilibrium price. Analytic results are more elusive in this model, but, restricting equilibria
to those in which LOLR facilities increase the price of the illiquid asset, numerical analysis shows
that the qualitative results of the simpler model obtain. In particular, the moral hazard effect
still exists and, for certain ranges of LOLR funding terms, the LOLR facility increases the bank’s
probability of default.
The version of the model with an endogenously-determined asset price generates a further
result that has particular relevance for public policy. Giving the buyer access to the LOLR facility,
instead of the troubled bank, results in an equilibrium with a higher illiquid asset price, a higher
degree of bank deleveraging, and a lower probability of bank default. In other words, a buyer-access
LOLR facility may overcome the moral hazard that is the subject of this paper.
The case study section of the paper shows that the behavior of U.S. broker-dealers during the
crisis of 2007-2009 is consistent with the model and its results. The section starts with a primer
on broker-dealer balance sheets and introduces “illiquid inventory leverage,” a new measure of a
financial firm’s risk that is more consistent with market concerns during the crisis than are the
more traditional measures of leverage. The paper then documents the deleveraging behavior of
broker-dealers after the establishment of the TSLF and PDCF in mid-March 2008. The weakest
two broker-dealers, namely Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, did reduce broader measures
3

of leverage, but did little to reduce their most important exposures, i.e., their risks to illiquid
assets, and failed in September 2008. The strongest two broker-dealers, namely Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs, did reduce illiquid leverage substantially in response to the the fall of Bear
Stearns, but then took a break from deleveraging in the third quarter of that year. In the market
turmoil following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, however, Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs resumed their reduction of illiquid asset inventory, but market conditions at that point
limited what they could accomplish.
The facts of broker-dealer deleveraging are consistent with the model of the paper: during a
crisis, with the security of LOLR facilities in place, broker-dealers delevered relatively slowly, and
the weaker among them delevered most slowly. Only anecdotal evidence, however, can connect these
facts with the motives driving broker-dealer behavior. To that end, this paper reviews statements of
broker-dealer management during earnings calls, like the Merrill Lynch call recounted earlier. This
body of evidence indicates quite clearly that management understood the significance of existing
LOLR facilities, but set deleveraging strategies to maximize their firms’ private interests.
The paper concludes by exploring two sets of policies motivated by the theoretical and empirical results just described. The first set of policies is to mitigate the moral hazard of reduced
deleveraging directly, i.e., by conditioning access to LOLR facilities on some degree of leverage
reduction or asset sales. The extent of the conditioning would be calibrated, of course, so as not
to sacrifice unduly the systemic benefits of the LOLR facilities. Importantly, to this end, the conditioning can be implemented so as to exlclude funding of customer positions. The second set of
policies is to encourage institutions with relatively clean balance sheets to use the LOLR facilities
to purchase illiquid assets. This policy could temporarily support the price of such assets while
facilitating, rather than slowing, the deleveraging of troubled financial institutions.
The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3
presents and analyzes the model with an exogenously-determined illiquid asset price while Section
4 extends the model to an endogenously-determined price. Section 5 presents the case study of
broker-dealer deleveraging from ’07 to ’09. Section 6 explores policies to mitigage the moral-hazard
consequences of LOLR. Section 7 concludes.

Literature Review

Recent theoretical literature recognizes the nexus of bank liquidity, solvency, and LOLR policies.
Rochet and Vives (2004) and Diamond and Rajan (2005) stress that it is generally difficult to
distinguish between an illiquid and an insolvent institution, which implies that a central bank can
easily find itself lending to an insolvent institution. Their results suggest that the much celebrated
prescription of Bagehot (1873) for LOLR policies might be right after all. He proposed that the
central bank, in times of panic, freely advance reserves to any private bank able to offer “what in
ordinary times is reckoned a good security” as collateral, but at a penalty rate, so as to discourage
applications from banks not really in need of funds. While Bagehot was concerned primarily with
the practical goal of conserving limited reserves, this literature provides a new rationale for such
intervention.3
On the theoretical front, this paper is related both to Rochet and Vives (2004) and Diamond
and Rajan (2005), but is more specifically focused on understanding how LOLR facilities affect
the deleveraging decisions of financial institutions and the market prices of illiquid assets. More
specifically, when does the moral hazard effect of LOLR facilities, which reduces deleveraging at
eligible firms, increase their likelihood of default, despite the fact that LOLR increases asset prices?
On the empirical front, evidence has accumulated on how the provision of central bank
liquidity relaxes institutions’ funding constraints, and thereby supports the prices of illiquid assets.
See Fleming (2012), for example, for a review of studies documenting that the Federal Reserve’s
suite of LOLR policies during the recent financial crisis lowered inter-bank borrowing spreads and
raised the prices of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Empirical work on the ex-ante
incentives of firms participating in LOLR facilities, however, like the case study in this paper, is a
relatively new line of investigation.
Acharya et al. (2011) find that the weaker broker-dealers borrowed at the Federal Reserve’s
TSLF and PDCF, even after controlling for the size of their illiquid inventory. Acharya and Steffen
(2012) document that under-capitalized banks in the peripheral countries, especially Spain and
3

See Fischer (1999) for an excellent survey of LOLR policy prescriptions and the literature that evolved from these
prescriptions. Although Fischer’s focus is on the role that can be played by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
as the international LOLR when sovereign or banking crises need to be contained from spreading across borders, he
also succinctly presents the argument underlying the moral hazard induced by LOLR, including domestic LOLR. He
recognizes that, while moral hazard needs to be contained, it is unlikely to be eliminated entirely through the design
of LOLR facilities.

Italy, used the ECB’s LTRO to increase their exposures to relatively risky domestic bonds, thus
tightening the feedback loop between banks and sovereigns in the periphery.4 Drechsler et al.
(2013), using data on collateral tendered to the ECB, find that that liquidity facility was used by
some of the riskier firms in the periphery to hold on to their illiquid and risky positions, which
included not only sovereign credit but also mortgage-related investments.
Implicit in much of this empirical work is the underlying fact that the terms (e.g., tenor,
interest rate, haircut, and collateral eligibility) of the LOLR operations of the Federal Reserve,
the ECB, and the Bank of England did not, for the most part, depend on the health of eligible
banks and broker-dealers.5 One rationale for this kind of extensive and unconditional support from
central banks is that banking sector recapitalizations, which can easily require public funds, may
not be feasible due to political economy constraints, such as myopia, as in Acharya and Rajan
(2013). Growing empirical evidence, including that in this paper, however, clarifies that central
bank support is no panacea as it has the unintended consequence of slowing down the deleveraging
process and potentially increasing the likelihood of future crises. Indeed, unconditional central
bank support can weaken the political resolve to ensure timely recapitalization of distressed parts
of the financial sector.
One policy we explore in this paper that might address this unintended consequence is to
condition LOLR support on participant solvency. This policy is related to Acharya and Backus
(2009) who argued that central bank liquidity provision should be made conditional on adequate
solvency estimates of financial institutions, e.g., maximum leverage ratio or minimum capital adequacy. Lack of such conditionality can allow weaknesses of these institutions to fester, creating
“zombie banks” and further deepening the crisis.6 A related policy we explore in this paper is to
condition LOLR support on a certain amount of deleveraging or asset sales, which would likely
stabilize the borrower.
Both of these policies are related to the discussion in the international context, along the

See Acharya, Drechsler and Schnabl (2010, 2012) for theoretical and empirical illustrations of how financial-sector
and sovereign credit risks impact one another.
5
In a particularly startling example, Acharya and Steffen (2012) show that the Bank of Cyprus, using ECB
financing, appears to have quadrupled its holdings of Greek debt 2010-11.
6
Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap (2008), in the context of the Japanese banking crisis of the 1990s, attributes the
phenomenon of “zombie banks” lending to “zombie firms,” along with the resulting credit crunch, to the excessive
forbearance of the Bank of Japan. Diamond and Rajan (2011) argue that delaying fire sales in expectation of central
bank or government support can increase the returns to liquidity (i.e., to the capacity for acquiring assets that are
eventually sold in fire sales) and lead to an ex-ante freeze in credit markets.

lines of Fischer (1999). Emergency support by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a form
of international LOLR, can allow participating countries to slow structural reforms, which might
make future sovereign crises more likely. This moral hazard justifies both linking lending rates to
measures of solvency and conditioning IMF support on strict and possibly unpopular structural
reforms. Fischer (1999) recognizes that an extreme form of conditioning, e.g., not lending to certain
countries altogether, may lack credibility if they or their banks are too big to fail. In that case
Fischer (1999) recommends that those receiving support be pushed by the IMF toward growthfriendly reforms with respect to, for example, fiscal prudence, monetary and financial transparency,
securities markets standards, bankruptcy regulations, and entry of foreign banks.
Another policy we explore in this paper is to provide liquidity not to distressed financial
intermediaries, but to potential buyers of distressed assets. These potential buyers must be financially strong, of course, so as not merely to shift the insolvency problem from one set of firms to
another. He, Khang and Krishnamurthy (2010), studying the adjustment of balance-sheet assets
in the United States from 2007-2009, find that much of the leverage shifted from segments of the
financial sector without access to LOLR financing (i.e., hedge funds and initially broker-dealers)
towards segments covered by LOLR financing (i.e., commercial banks) or by government support
(i.e., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). The policy explored in this paper is more nuanced than such
an arrangement, calling for the provision of LOLR financing to any healthy, buyers of assets rather
than to a pre-ordained set of financial firms, such as commercial banks and thrifts, that already
happen to have access to LOLR facilities. Indeed, some firms with such access or with government support (e.g., Washington Mutual, Citibank, GSEs) were excessively leveraged at the time
they received public or central bank support. Judicious design of LOLR policy can prevent the
shift of leverage between firms in a way that has adverse or uncertain consequences for financial
stability. Indeed, providing liquidity to healthy potential buyers of assets can improve the ex-ante
incentives of financial firms to manage risks prudently and to keep capacity to purchase assets
opportunistically.7
7

A result from Acharya and Yorulmazer (2008) resonates here. In that model, in the case of multiple bank failures,
the optimal use of fiscal funds is to transfer liquidity to survivors. This curbs the ex-ante incentives for banks to herd
in owning correlated assets so as to induce bailouts in cases of en masse failures.

3

The Model with an Exogenous Illiquid Asset Price

This section presents a model designed to explore how LOLR facilities might affect the deleveraging
policy of a bank and its probability of default. The setting is the collision of a financial crisis and
an intermediary engaged in maturity and liquidity transformation. More specifically, a bank owns
a long-term, illiquid asset that has been funded, in part, by short-term debt. A poor economy
has reduced the expected cash flows of the asset, and distressed market conditions have depressed
the asset’s price even further. Under these circumstances, the bank would like to hold on to its
undervalued, illiquid asset, but, should its cash flows turn out to be particularly low, and should the
bank not be able to roll over enough of its short-term debt, the ensuing bankruptcy would wipe out
all of the bank’s equity. The bank will, therefore, choose to sell some of its illiquid asset holdings.
How much it chooses to sell, i.e., the extent to which it chooses to delever, depends crucially on
the extent to which it can fund its illiquid asset holdings as its short-term debt comes due. And
the availability of such funding during a financial crisis often depends on the the existence of an
LOLR facility.
The model yields two main results. First, an LOLR facility reduces a bank’s optimal amount
of deleveraging. Very simply, the ability to draw on LOLR funding when needed makes it less risky
for a bank to hold on to its illiquid assets. Second, LOLR facilities increase a bank’s probability
of default. It is clearly true that, for a given portfolio, the availability of LOLR funding lowers the
bank’s probability of default. But the LOLR facility increases the bank’s holdings of the illiquid
asset, as per the first result, which increases the bank’s probability of default. Despite the two
offsetting effects on the probability of default, in the model of this section the moral hazard effect
of increased risk taking always outweighs the liquidity insurance effect of available funding so as to
increase the bank’s probability of default.
Numerical examples of the model illustrate these two main results, along with the relationship
between initial leverage and the optimal amount of deleveraging. It turns out that, for large enough
initial leverage, a bank chooses optimally not to delever at all. As it becomes difficult to avoid
bankruptcy, even with the LOLR facility, it is best for equity to hold on to the upside potential of
the illiquid asset as long as possible.

8

3.1

Assumptions and Notation

The model has three dates, which are labeled 0, 1, and 2, and two assets. The liquid asset has a
price that equals 1 on every date, which implies a riskless rate equal to 0. The illiquid asset pays
x1 = x̄1 + u on date 1 and x2 > 0 on date 2, where x̄1 and x2 are constants and u is stochastic
with cumulative distribution and density functions of G(·) and g(·), respectively. The stochastic,
date-1 cash flow of the illiquid asset introduces a risk of bankruptcy to banks that are funding the
asset with short-term debt, i.e., with debt that matures on date 1. The positive, date-2 cash flow
of the asset motivates banks to avoid bankruptcy on date 1.
The price of the illiquid asset is given exogenously as p per unit, where p < x̄1 + E[u] + x2
and E(·) is the expectations operator. This condition on price ensures that the illiquid asset is
desirable as a positive expected value investment. The assumption of price exogeneity, by the way,
as mentioned in the introduction, will be relaxed in the next section.
Funding or repurchase markets work in the model as follows. A holder of illiquid assets can
borrow on date 1, on a secured basis, a fraction l < 1 of the date-2 cash flow of those assets.
The amount borrowed must be repaid on date 2. Borrowing and lending are effected through
the liquid asset at an interest rate of zero, as discussed earlier. Without access to an LOLR
facility, the fraction l represents the fraction advanced to a holder of the illiquid asset by private
funding markets. With access to an LOLR facility, the fraction l represents the maximum of the
fraction advanced by private funding markets and the fraction advanced by the LOLR facility.
This interpretation highlights the following phenomenon. When an LOLR facility stands ready to
advance a fraction l to a particular set of counterparties, private funding markets are often willing
to advance that same fraction l to that same set of counterparties. After all, should a lender need
its funds returned, the borrowing counterparty can always turn to the central bank for funds. Put
another way, when l is offered by the LOLR facility and is the highest advance fraction available in
the market, holders of the illiquid asset might nevertheless be borrowing that advance from private
markets.
The bank in the model is endowed on date 0 with eL of the liquid asset, eI of the illiquid
asset, and short-term debt outstanding of B, which must be repaid on date 1. To discharge this
date-1 debt obligation, the bank may borrow at the LOLR advance rate of l, as just described.

9

The bank is assumed to be solvent in the sense that the market value of its assets exceeds its debt
obligations, i.e., eL + peI > B.
Given its endowment, the nature of the assets, and its access to LOLR funding, the bank,
on date 0, maximizes the value of its equity by selling some quantity α of the illiquid asset for p
per unit (and investing the proceeds in the liquid asset). Note that, since bank equity is worthless
if the bank defaults on date 1, the date-0 value of the equity equals the expected value of its net
worth on date-2 conditional on the bank’s ability to discharge its date-1 debt.
Table 1 summarizes the bank’s cash flows for a given α assuming no date-1 default. The
bank starts on date 0 with liquid and illiquid asset endowments of eL and eI , respectively. On
date 0 the bank chooses to sell α of the illiquid asset for pα of the liquid asset. On date 1, the
bank carries over its liquid asset balance from date 0; collects its date-1 illiquid asset cash flow of
(eI − α)x1 , which it invests in the liquid asset; borrows (eI − α)lx2 from the LOLR facility in the
form of the liquid asset; and pays off its debt of B from its liquid asset holdings. Finally, on date
2, the bank carries over its date-1 liquid asset balance; collects its date-2 illiquid asset cash flow
of (eI − α)x2 , which it converts to liquid assets; and pays off its date-1 LOLR borrowing from its
liquid asset holdings. The value of the bank’s equity, therefore, conditional on no default, is simply
its expected date-2 liquid asset balance.
Note the implicit assumption of this discussion and of Table 1 is that the bank always borrows
the most it can borrow from the LOLR facility on date 1. This is a harmless simplification in the
context of this model. First, there are some realizations of u for which the bank does need to
borrow this maximum amount to avoid bankruptcy. Second, with an effective interest rate of 0,
there is no cost to borrowing more than necessary from the facility on date 1 and repaying the full
amount on date 2.
For a final observation on the model setting, make the sensible assumption that date-1 LOLR
loans are available to the bank only if it does not default on date 1. In that case, the bank never
defaults on its LOLR borrowing: it is advanced only a fraction l < 1 of its deterministic date-2
cash flow. More specifically, the bank is advanced (eI − α)lx2 on date 1, while, ruling out a date-1
default, it collects the greater quantity, (eI − α)x2 , with certainty.

10

3.2

The Bank’s Optimal Deleveraging Policy

The bank’s problem is to choose α on date 0 so as to maximize its expected date-2 net worth
conditional on not defaulting on date 1. Focusing for a moment on the condition for not defaulting,
the bank can meet its debt obligation so long as eL + pα + (eI − α)x1 + (eI − α)lx2 ≥ B, where
x1 = x̄1 + u. Furthermore, since the only stochastic component of this condition is u, there is
some realization of u below which the bank defaults and above which the bank does not default.
Denoting this default threshold value of u as uB , the condition for no default can be written as

u ≥ uB ≡

(eI

1
[B − eL − (eI − α)x̄1 − (eI − α)lx2 − pα]
− α)

(1)

The equity value of the bank, E, that is, its date-2 net worth conditional on not defaulting,
can now be written as

[eL + pα − B + (eI − α)x1 + (eI − α)x2 ]g(u)du

where the integrand is the date-2 liquid asset holding of the bank conditional on no default, as

where the inequality follows from the bank’s solvency condition given in the previous subsection.

Intuitively, as the bank sells more of the illiquid asset, the default threshold falls, i.e., bigger adverse
shocks are required to trigger a default, which means that the probability of default falls. In any
case, substituting expression (5) into (4) gives the final form of the first order condition:8

The Effect of LOLR on Deleveraging and Default Probabilities

This subsection presents two results of the model, namely, that an LOLR facility reduces the extent to which a bank delevers and increases its probability of default. The proofs are in Appendix A.

PROPOSITION 1:

dα∗
dl

≤ 0.

The intuition of Proposition 1 is straightforward. The more a bank can borrow against a
given illiquid asset holding, the lower its probability of default. Alternatively, increasing l makes
illiquid asset holdings more affordable in terms of default risk. Therefore, a bank responds to more
generous funding terms by optimally choosing to delever less. Recalling the discussion of l from
earler in this section, by the way, an increase in l can be interpreted either as an LOLR facility
providing better funding terms than previously available private funding or, more literally, as an
LOLR facility liberalizing its previously existing lending terms.

as the sum of two terms:

(7)

This first order condition does not always obtain, that is, under certain conditions the bank will be at a corner
solution. Furthermore, the transition to a corner solution may not be continuous in l or B. Such corner solutions are
interesting because a jump from a positive, optimal α to 0 represents a shift in strategy from deleveraging to pure
risk-shifting.

12

The first term on the right hand side is the liquidity insurance effect. The more a bank can
borrow against the illiquid asset, the lower its default threshold and the lower its probability of
default. It is clear from equation (1), in fact, that

∂uB
∂l

= −x2 < 0, i.e., the liquidity insurance

effect always decreases bank risk.
The second term on the right hand side of equation (7) is the moral hazard effect. The bank
takes account of a change in l in its optimal deleveraging strategy. Knowing that l has increased,
the bank chooses to hold more of the illiquid asset, or, equivalently, chooses a lower α, as shown
in Proposition 1. But this reduced deleveraging increases the default threshold and increases the
probability of default, as shown in (5). Mathematically, since both factors of this second term are
negative, their product is positive. Hence, the moral hazard effect always adds to bank risk.
With the liquidity insurance effect decreasing risk and the moral hazard effect increasing risk,
the real thrust of Proposition 2 is the conclusion that the moral hazard effect dominates so that
LOLR facilities increase bank risk. This result will not be as strong in the next section, where the
illiquid asset price is determined endogenously. For now, however, the paper turns to numerical
examples of the model currently under consideration.

3.4

Numerical Examples and Comparative Statics

In the spirit of the model just presented, the setting of these examples is a bank that, in better
times, borrowed short-term funds to finance the purchase of a long-term, relatively illiquid asset.
The quality of the asset then deteriorated, i.e., its price fell, its expected cash flows fell, the volatility
of its cash flows increased, and the haircut required to fund the asset in private markets increased.
As a result, the bank may very well not be able to raise sufficient funds when it needs to refinance
the asset to pay off outstanding short-term debt. In other words, the bank may very well default
on its short-term debt and, consequently, lose the longer-term cash flows of the asset. The bank
chooses, therefore, to sell some portion of its illiquid asset holdings. Crucial to this decision, of
course, are the terms of any LOLR lending facility through which the bank can raise funds on the
collateral of its remaining asset holdings.

3.4.1

Base Case Parameters

Consider the following base case:
13

i. A bank is endowed with one unit of the illiquid asset at time 0. This asset pays 1 + u at
time 1 and 1.10 at time 2, where u is normally distributed with a mean µ = 0 and a standard
deviation σ = 0.25.
ii. The bank has short-term debt outstanding, which requires a payment of 1.75 on date 1.
iii. Through an LOLR secured-lending facility, the bank may, on date 1, borrow 85% of the date-2
cash flow of the risky asset. This borrowing must be repaid on date 2.
iv. The price of the risky asset is 2.098. This price is exogenous in this setting, but will emerge as
the general equilibrium price in an example later in the paper.
This bank is at significant risk of default. Say that the asset were to experience a one
standard-deviation adverse shock, i.e., u = −0.25, so that its date-1 cash flow were 0.75. Then,
even after raising 0.935 through the LOLR (i.e., 85% of the date-2 cash flow of 1.10), the bank’s
cash balance is only 0.75 + 0.935, or 1.685, which is insufficient to repay the maturing debt of 1.75.
One measure of the riskiness of this bank’s balance sheet is its illiquid inventory leverage. Its only
asset is one unit of the risky asset, which is worth 2.098. The book value of its debt is 1.75, which
gives a book equity of 2.098 − 1.75, or .348. Hence, the bank’s illiquid inventory leverage is

2.098
0.348 ,

or a bit over 6.0.

3.4.2

Results

Recognizing that holding the full unit endowment of the illiquid asset is too risky, the bank chooses
to sell α of that asset so as to maximize its equity value. Using the base case parameters, the
optimal α turns out to be 0.60, or, equivalently, the bank chooses to retain only 0.40 of its original
unit position. Furthermore, a holding of this reduced size implies a probability of default on date
1 of 0.2%.
Figures 1 (a) and 1 (b) show how the bank’s optimal α, and probability of default change
with l, the fraction of the date-2 cash flow that can be financed through the LOLR facility. Figure
1 (a) shows that α decreases with l. The more generous the LOLR, the more the bank can raise on
the date-2 cash flow of the illiquid asset, and the less the bank chooses to delever. This is the moral
hazard effect of LOLR facilities. Imagine for a moment that the private market would finance only
14

50% of the date-2 cash flow. Then, according to Figure 1 (a), the bank would sell about 0.76 of its
illiquid asset holdings. Given the existence of an LOLR facility with l = 85%, however, the bank
optimally sells only 0.60 of its holdings. Note too that as the l rises above 88%, α drops to 0, i.e.,
the bank chooses not to delever at all.
Figure 1 (b) shows that the bank’s probability of default increases with l. At l = 50% the
probability of default is about 0.02%, while at l = 85% the probability of default is more than
10 times higher at about 0.22%. For any fixed α, the probability of default decreases with l: the
more the LOLR facility lends against the illiquid asset, the less likely a default. However, because
the bank reduces α as the LOLR facility becomes more generous, the net effect is to increase its
probability of default. In this way, one of the goals of LOLR, namely, to reduce the likelihood of
bank defaults, is fully subverted by the moral hazard effect of reduced deleveraging. Note that
moving to the highest levels of l in Figure 1 (b), like 89%, at which level the bank chooses not to
delever at all, the probability of default rises dramatically to about 18%, which is off the scale of
Figure 1 (b). Any further increase in l will, of course, lower the probability of default since α is
from then on fixed at 0.
Figures 2 (a), 2 (b), and 2 (c) show how the bank’s optimal α and probability of default
change with illiquid inventory leverage, a measure of the risk of a bank’s balance sheet. Leverage
is varied for these figures by varying B, the amount of debt due on date 1. For very low leverage,
when the probability of default is zero, the bank does not need to sell any of its illiquid asset.
For intermediate levels of leverage, the bank chooses α, the extent of deleveraging, to target a
probability of default of approximately 0.22%. Finally, for even higher levels of leverage, the bank
chooses not to delever at all and the probability of default jumps to nearly 50% and higher, which,
as that is off the scale of Figure 2 (b), is shown in Figure 2 (c). At these elevated risk levels,
the relatively small increase in survival probability from deleveraging does not compensate for the
foregone returns on the illiquid asset. This result will be invoked later in the paper to explain, at
least in part, why particular investment banks failed to reduce illiquid inventory leverage in 2008.

4

The Model with an Endogenous Illiquid Asset Price

No discussion of bank deleveraging can be complete without some discussion of the behavior of those
who purchase the illiquid asset that the banks are selling. The most likely purchasers certainly need
to have the balance sheet and risk capacity to purchase distressed assets in a time of crisis, but
they must also be knowledgeable about the asset and operationally and legally prepared to own it.
These likely purchasers could include banks with less-levered balance sheets, other levered money
with spare capital and risk capacity, e.g., hedge funds, and real money, e.g., wealth management
institutions, pension funds, and insurance companies.
With respect to the results of this paper, the interaction of the buyers of the asset and the
banks will determine how the price of the illiquid asset changes as the terms of an LOLR facility
become more or less generous. How robust are the results of the model of Section 3, in which price
is fixed and exogenous, to a setting in which price is endogenously determined?
This section lays out a model in which the price of the illiquid asset is determined by the
supply from banks and the demand from potential buyers. While it is difficult to draw general
conclusions from this substantially more complicated world, it is not difficult to show numerical
examples in which the results of the previous section obtain, i.e., in which LOLR facilities reduce
bank deleveraging and increase the probability of bank default.
The model of this section allows for the possibility that the buyers have access to an LOLR
facility, either along with the banks or instead of the banks. Numerical results in these cases will
be invoked in the policy discussion of Section 6.

4.1

Assumptions and Notation

The properties of the asset, the rules of the LOLR facility, and the characteristics of the bank are
the same here as in Section 3. Therefore, changing notation by indexing quantities, the bank’s
optimization problem here is identical to that of Section 3, i.e.,

max EBank = (e

αBank

I,Bank

−α

Bank

Z

∞

)
uBank
B

[(u − uBank
) + (1 − lBank )x2 ]g(u)du
B

(8)

The model notation for the buyer is very much like that for the bank. The buyer has

16

endowments of the liquid and illiquid assets, it has debt due on date 1, and it has access to the
LOLR facility with the parameter lBuyer . The buyer’s decision variable, however, which is denoted
αBuyer , gives the amount of the illiquid asset bought, rather than sold, on date 0. Table 2 puts
all of this together to illustrate the cash flows of the buyer for a given αBuyer conditional on no
default. This table is, of course, the buyer’s analog of Table 1.
The use of two different LOLR parameters, lBank and lBuyer , requires some clarification. This
notation is simply a formalism for several special cases of interest. If the bank has access to an
LOLR facility but the buyer does not, lBank denotes the parameter of the LOLR facility while
lBuyer denotes the best available advance in private funding markets. If the buyer has access to
the facility while the bank does not, a case considered in the numerical results to follow, lBank
denotes a private funding market advance while lBuyer denotes the facility’s advance. To take one
additional example, if both the bank and the buyer have access to the same LOLR facility on the
same terms, then lBank = lBuyer .
With notation now specified, the buyer’s optimization problem can be derived along the same
lines as that of the bank, and turns out to be

max EBuyer = (e

αBuyer

I,Buyer

+α

Buyer

Z
)

∞

uBuyer
B

[(u − uBuyer
) + (1 − lBuyer )x2 ]g(u)du

(9)

The feasible range for αBank and αBuyer has not been explicitly included in the recording of
these two optimization problems, but the restrictions are straightforward. The bank can only sell
the illiquid assets with which it was endowed; the buyer can never buy more of the illiquid asset
than the bank’s endowment; the buyer cannot spend more on its purchases of illiquid assets than
it has in liquid assets; etc.
The bank and the buyer optimally choose an amount of the illiquid asset to sell and to buy,
respectively. The market clears when the amount the bank chooses to sell equals the amount the
buyer chooses to buy. The resulting equilibrium is described more formally as follows:
DEFINITION 1: A competitive equilibrium is an allocation {αBank∗ , αBuyer∗ } and a price p∗ such
that, given p∗ , αBank∗ solves equation (8), αBuyer∗ solves equation (9), and the market clears in that

17

αBank∗ = αBuyer∗

(10)

This version of the model, with the endogenous price determination of the illiquid asset,
can generate a wide variety of results depending on the endowments and leverage of the banks
and buyers.9 For the purposes of this paper, one conceptually appealing restriction when the bank
alone has access to the LOLR facility is to consider only equilibria in which LOLR facilities increase
the price of the illiquid asset. Intuitively, making it easier for the market to fund the illiquid asset
should increase rather than decrease its traded price. To express this restriction mathematically,
implicitly differentiate equation (10) to obtain
∂αBank dp
∂αBuyer dp
∂αBank
+
−

∂p dlBank
∂p dlBank

(11)

or

dp
dlBank

>0

if and only if

∂αBank
∂αBuyer
−
>0
∂p
∂p

(13)

This condition reveals that the restriction of equilibria to cases in which the price increases
with lBank is met when the bank supply curve and the buyer demand curve are restricted to their
expected slopes. If the bank optimally chooses to sell more of the illiquid asset as its price increases,
then the first term of equation (13) is positive. If the buyer optimally buys less of the illiquid asset
as its price increases, then the contribution of the second term of equation (13) is positive as well.
9
In certain parameterizations, for example, in which the bank is very highly levered, a U-shaped bank supply
curve and a downward-sloping buyer demand curve give rise to multiple equilibria.

18

Hence, if both curves slope as expected, the inequality of equation (13) does hold and, as just
shown, price increases with l.

4.2

The Effect of LOLR on Default Probabilities

In the version of the model with an exogenously determined illiquid asset price, equation (7) revealed
that a liquidity insurance effect and a moral hazard effect explain the effect of an LOLR facility
on a bank’s default threshold and its probabilty of default. With an endogenously determined
price, the total change in uB for a change in l has an extra term. (Note that superscripts explicitly
denoting bank quantities are omitted here.)
duB
∂uB
∂uB dα∗ ∂uB dp∗
=
+
+
dl
∂l
∂α dl
∂p dl

(14)

The first and second terms of equation (14) are the liquidity insurance and moral hazard
effects, respectively, just as in equation (7). The third term can be called the price externality
effect. As l increases for a given price, each perfectly competitive bank reduces its sales of the
illiquid asset. But, with a downward-sloping buyer demand curve, the aggregate reduction in sales
by the banking sector increases the equilibrium price. This price increase, in turn, raises the value
of the representative bank’s assets and lowers it default threshold and probability of default. More
mathematically, with the restriction of equilibria to those in which

dp∗
dl

> 0 and with

∂uB
∂p

< 0, the

price externality effect in equation (14) is negative, i.e., it lowers the bank’s default threshold and
its probability of default.
To summarize, Proposition 2 argued that, with an exogenously determined illiquid asset price,
the moral hazard effect dominates the liquidity insurance effect so that an LOLR facility increases
the probability of a bank’s default. This section shows that, with price determined endogenously,
the price externality effect decreases the probability of default. Therefore, with an endogenously
determined price, a bank’s probability of default may increase or decrease depending on the relative
sizes of the various effects. In the numerical results of the following subsection, for example, at
relatively low values of l the LOLR facility decreases bank risk while, at relatively high values of l,
the LOLR facility increases bank risk.

19

4.3

Numerical Examples and Comparative Statics

The numerical examples of Section 3.4 showed that more generous LOLR facilities result in less
bank deleveraging and higher probabilities of default. These results, however, did not consider
the possibility that changes in the terms of LOLR facilities change the price of the illiquid asset
and, through that price effect, change deleveraging decisions and probabilities of default. In the
examples of this section, more generous LOLR facilities do affect price, but still result in less bank
deleveraging and can still result in higher probabilities of default.
In the spirit of the model of Section 4, the examples here include an investor, or “buyer,” who
is familiar with and who owns the illiquid asset, but who is significantly less leveraged. This lower
balance sheet risk makes it worthwhile for the buyer to purchase the illiquid asset at distressed
prices from the highly-levered banks.
To highlight the fact that LOLR facilities are typically open only to banks, Sections 4.3.1
and 4.3.2 continue to assume that the bank can borrow some fraction l of the date-2 cash flow of
the risky asset, as in the examples of Section 3.4, but assume that the buyer has no access to such
borrowing. It would not change the qualitative numerical results, however, were the buyer able to
borrow some smaller fraction of the date-2 cash flow of the illiquid asset in private funding markets.
Finally, to explore an important policy implication of the framework of this paper, Section
4.3.3 assumes that the buyer, instead of the seller, has access to the LOLR facility. The bank,
barred from using that window, has access only to private funding markets, which do not advance
as much against the illiquid asset as does the LOLR facility.
4.3.1

Base Case Parameters

The parameters of the bank in this example are the same as in the partial equilibrium case of
Section 3.5. The parameters of the buyer may be described as follows:
i. The buyer holds 1.70 of the liquid asset, which has a fixed price of 1.0.
ii. The buyer holds one unit of the illiquid asset.
iii. The buyer has short-term debt outstanding, which requires a payment of 0.50 on date 1.
iv. The buyer cannot borrow on date 1 to finance holdings of the risky asset.
20

4.3.2

Base Case Results

Figure 3 shows a demand curve and two supply curves for the illiquid asset under the base case
parameters. The higher supply curve is for l = 80% while the lower supply curve is for l = 85%.
For this lower supply curve, the figure reveals that there is an equilibrium in which the bank sells
about 0.60 units of the illiquid asset to the buyer at a price of 2.098.
Increasing l from 80% to 85% shifts the supply curve down, of course: for any given price,
the bank optimally sells less of the illiquid asset when it can fund that asset more easily. Given the
shape of the demand curve, this increase in l increases the equilibrium price from 2.096 to 2.098
and lowers the equilibrium quantity traded from 0.63 to 0.60. In this sense, the result from the
fixed-price version of the model, that higher l reduces bank deleveraging, can obtain when price is
endogenously determined. Put another way, in the equilibria of Figure 3, despite the equilibrium
price increasing as l increases from 80% to 85%, the banks, in equilibrium, delever less after that
increase.
Figures 4 (a) through 4 (c) show the effect of l on equilibrium prices and quantities. Figures
4 (a) and 4 (b) show that the equilibrium price increases and that the equilibrium quantity traded
decreases as the LOLR facility becomes more generous. A higher l reduces the bank’s desire to
supply the asset, which given the downward-sloping buyer demand, increases equilibrium price, and
reduces equilibrium quantity.
Figure 4 (c) graphs the probability of the bank’s and buyer’s defaulting as a function of l. In
the exogenously-determined price examples of Section 3.4, higher l causes the bank to delever less,
which, in turn, raises its probability of default. As Figure 4 (c) shows, however, the effect of l on
the probability of default in the endogenous price setting is more complicated. As just illustrated,
increasing l reduces equilbrium bank α and increases equilibrium price. The first effect, reducing
sales of the risky asset, increases the probability of default, as in the exogenous price case. The
second effect, however, that of increasing price, allows banks to accumulate more cash from asset
sales and thus reduces the probability of default. In Figure 4 (c), the bank’s probability of default
falls as l increases from 50% to about 76% but rises as l increases beyond that. The shape of this
curve is too dependent on all of the parameters chosen to draw very broad conclusions, but the
qualitative result emerges quite clearly: there are parameter regions over which improved funding

21

terms through an LOLR facility increase the probability of a bank default. This improvement of
funding terms can, as before, be interpreted either as an improvement relative to the terms of
private market funding or relative to the terms of a previously existing LOLR facility.
The probability of default for the buyer of the illiquid asset in Figure 4 (c) decreases monotonically in l. With higher l, buyers purchase less of the illiquid asset, although at a higher price
per unit. In this example, however, the buyers spend monotonically less on the illiquid asset as l
increases and, consequently, are less likely to default.

4.3.3

Examples with Buyer Rather than Bank Access to LOLR

In this section, only the buyer of the risky asset is allowed access to the LOLR facility, i.e., the
buyer can, on date 1, borrow a fraction l of its date-2 cash flow. The bank, by contrast, has access
only to private funding markets, which are assumed exogenously to finance 70% of the date-2 cash
flow.
Figure 5 shows the bank supply curve of the illiquid asset, along with two buyer demand
curves, one for l = 5% and the other for l = 10%. Higher l increases the buyer demand for the
asset at each price, raising equilibrium price and quantity traded.
Figures 6 (a) through 6 (c) illustrate comparative statics in this setting. Under the parameters
chosen, the buyers are so lightly levered that relatively low levels of LOLR support are sufficient
to generate strong demand.
Figures 6 (a) and 6 (b) confirm the intution from the shifted demand curve in Figure 5,
namely, that equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity both increase with l. Figure 6 (c) shows
that the probability of default of both the bank and the buyer decrease with l. In this setting
with an endogenously-determined illiquid asset price, the bank delevers more at a higher l, so its
probability of default falls. The buyer does purchase more of the risky asset as l increases, but the
combination of low leverage and increasing LOLR support results in a falling probability of default
for the buyer as well. Further implications of these results will be explored in the policy discussion
of Section 6.

U.S. Broker-Dealer Deleveraging in 2008

This section presents an empirical case study of broker-dealer deleveraging in 2008, which supports
the conclusions of the model presented earlier. In particular, in the presence of the LOLR facilities
put in place in March 2008, broker-dealers were quite slow in reducing risk through the crisis.
The measure of risk used here, which is new to this paper, is called “illiquid inventory leverage.”
Furthermore, in a manner consistent with the model, the firms most at risk, namely Lehman
Brothers and Merrill Lynch, were slower to reduce risk than the more creditworthy firms, namely
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Finally, anecdotal evidence from press releases and investor
calls around earnings announcements demonstrates that firms were taking the presence of LOLR
facilities as given and optimizing their own risk and return profiles independent of any broader
social objectives of those facilities.

5.1

A Short Primer on Broker-Dealer Balance Sheets and Measures of Leverage

Table 3 consolidates various line items to present a simplified balance sheet for Morgan Stanley
at the end of its first fiscal quarter in 2008. Panel A shows the balance sheet approximately as it
would appear in a 10-Q or 10-K filing.
On the asset side, the first line gives loans in the form of “Collateralized Agreements,” i.e.,
loans that are collateralized or secured by financial assets. When fixed income assets secure the
loans, these collateralized agreements usually take the form of reverse repos. When equities secure
the loans, the agreements usually take the form of stock borrows.
The second line on the asset sides gives “Financial Instruments Owned,” which can be thought
of as the firm’s inventory. The third line, “Goodwill and Intangibles,” is typically a relatively small
part of the balance sheet. The fourth and last line gives “Other Assets,” which includes items
like receivables, customer cash and securities segregated for safekeeping, and securities received as
collateral to ensure performance on various financial contracts.
On the liabilities and equity side, the “Collateralized Agreements” in the first line refer to the
broker-dealer’s borrowing of cash secured by financial assets. For fixed income assets this usually
takes the form of repos, while, for equities, this usually takes the form of stock loans.
The second line on the liabilities and equity side gives “Shorts,” securities that the firm has

23

sold and will ultimately have to repurchase. The third line gives the amount outstanding of “Junior
Subordinated Notes,” which are included in some measures of equity. The fourth line gives “Other
Borrowings,” which includes payables, customer deposits, obligations to return securities posted as
collateral, short-term borrowings (e.g., commercial paper), and long-term debt. The fifth and last
line gives “Total Equity.”
While standard for reporting purposes, the balance sheet in Panel A aggregates business
activities at such a high level that it obscures very significant differences in risk across these activities. To gain some insight into the variation of risk across activities, Panel B presents a relatively
well-known conceptual disaggregation of the balance sheet into “Gross” and “Net” assets. This
rough cut is meant to separate gross assets, which represent relatively safe activity on behalf of
customers, from net assets, which represent relatively risky activity arising from positions taken by
the broker-dealer.
The first highlighted activity in the gross asset category is the “matched book” business,
which consists of relatively short-term lending of cash to customers, taking securities as collateral,
and relatively short-term borrowing of cash from customers, giving securities as collateral. Matchedbook assets in Panel B are $215.681 billion collateralized cash lending and matched-book liabilities
are $215.681 billion collateralized cash borrowing. This business is regarded as relatively safe for two
reasons. First, so long as collateral requirements are set appropriately, the individual collateralized
agreements are relatively safe. Second, should there be a systemic liquidity shock, the brokerdealer could rapidly shrink the matched-book simply by letting the relatively short-term assets and
liabilities mature and by declining to renew them. This would result in difficulties for customers, of
course, and would reduce revenues at the broker-dealer, but the broker-dealer would be protecting
its own viability.
Skipping over the small line item of “Goodwill and Intangibles,” the second highlighted
activity in the gross asset category are $233.992 billion of “Other Gross Assets,” which consist
of the same assets mentioned above in the context of “Other Assets.” These are also regarded as
representing relatively safe activities: receivables are often collateralized; segregated customer cash
and securities are custodian-like businesses; and securities received as collateral present little risk
to the broker dealer. The liability-side components of “Other Gross Assets” are part of “Other
Borrowings.”
24

Turning to the relatively risky businesses, represented by “Net Assets,” the first line shows
the collateralized agreements used to cover the “Shorts” on the liability side. Put another way, the
broker-dealer shorted $171.111 of securities, representing some unknown combination of stand-alone
positions and hedges. The liabilities of that activity are the obligations to purchase those securities
in the future. The assets are the cash loans made in the process of borrowing the securities so as
to deliver securities sold short. Compared with gross asset activity, net asset activity is relatively
risky due the price risk of stand-alone positions or the basis risk of hedges.
The second and largest of the “net assets” businesses is inventory holdings, represented by
“Financial Instruments Owned.” The broker-dealer here owned $445.837 of assets. As indicated
on the liability side, a portion of this inventory, $72.454 billion,10 is funded by collateralized agreements, i.e., that amount of cash was borrowed on the collateral of inventory held. The rest of the
inventory is effectively funded by portions of the remaining liability categories, i.e., junior subordinated notes, other borrowings, and equity. Inventory is relatively risky, like short sales, due to the
price risk of stand-alone positions and the basis risk of hedges.
Inventory can be further subdivided by asset quality. Starting in 2007, broker-dealers broke
down their fair-valued assets into Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 assets. Essentially, Level 1 assets are
those for which market prices are readily available; Level 2 assets are those valued through their
comparability with other assets for which market prices are available; and Level 3 assets are those
for which values are derived through some discounted cash flow model. This paper refers to Level
1 assets as “liquid” assets and to Level 2 and 3 assets as “illiquid assets.”11
With this background, the discussion turns to various measures of leverage, described in Panel
C, as rough indicators of risk. “Gross Leverage” is defined as the ratio of assets to total equity. For
Morgan Stanley in Q1 2008, gross leverage was 32.8. Interpreting this ratio as a measure of risk, a
1/32.8 or approximately 3% fall in the value of assets would wipe out the firm’s equity.
10

The collateralized agreements are allocated to the various activities as follows. Shorts of $171.111 billion require
that amount of collateralized agreement assets, leaving the total collateralized agreements, $386.792 billion, minus
$171.111 billion, or $215,681 billion, as matched-book assets. By definition, matched-book liabilities equal matchedbook assets, so subtracting $215,681 of collateralized agreement liabilities from total collateralized agreement liabilities
of $288,135 billion, leaves $72,454 for funding.
11
Level 1 assets are almost always more liquid than Level 2 and Level 3 assets, but grouping Level 2 and Level 3
assets together makes sense because assets migrate more fluidly between these categories than between Level 1 and
Level 2. During the crisis, sales of particular assets in a particular quarter provided pricing benchmarks for other
assets, which could then move from Level 3 to Level 2. Similarly, a dearth of sales and, therefore, benchmark prices
in a particular quarter, would push various Level 2 assets to Level 3.

25

Leading up to the financial crisis, investment banks argued that gross leverage overstated
their risk because, as discussed above, gross assets are characterized by particularly low risk. A
more appropriate measure of leverage or risk, they argued, is net leverage, defined as net assets
divided by tangible equity capital. By this measure, Morgan Stanley’s leverage was only 16.0,
which implies that net assets have to fall by 6.25% to wipe out firm equity.
While net leverage might be a better measure of risk than gross leverage, analysts and investors during the crisis were most focused on the quality of assets within net assets. How much
of theses assets are loans rather than securities? How much are securitized products with somewhat impenetrable composition? How much are real-estate related? Some remarks by market
participants, which illustrate the focus on asset quality at the time, are given in Appendix B.
Given the concerns of the market at the time with low quality assets, this paper defines a
new measure of leverage to compare risks across firms during the financial crisis. This measure,
called “Illiquid Inventory Leverage,” is defined as the ratio of Level 2 and Level 3 assets to Tangible
Equity Capital. As computed in Panel C of Table 3, illiquid inventory leverage for Morgan Stanley
in Q1 2008 was 9.6.
The final measure of leverage listed in Panel C is “Quasi-Market Leverage,” which is used
more by researchers than by market participants. The idea is to get a better measure of risk by
using the stock market’s perception of the value of the equity instead of its book value. By this
measure, Morgan Stanley’s leverage was 23.7, which fell about midway between its net and gross
leverage measures.

Deleveraging by U.S. Broker-Dealers in 2008

Table 4 reports various balance sheet elements in 2008 for the five major U.S. broker-dealers,
namely, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs.
While the story of each investment bank is somewhat idiosyncratic, there are several common
themes. In particular, while both internal and external pressures pushed the firms to reduce balance
sheets, holdings of relatively less risky assets were reduced first. Only when pressures intensified
dramatically did the broker-dealers reduce illiquid asset holdings. Note, by the way, that Merrill
Lynch’s fiscal year ended in December. The fiscal years of the other investment banks ended in
November, so their quarters were December through February, March through May, etc.
26

Panel A shows that Bear Stearns, over Q4 2007 and Q1 2008, as the crisis started to brew,
did little to reduce assets. Its perceived vulnerability to mortgage-related products, reflected in its
precipitously declining market capitalization, led to the firm’s absorption into JPMorgan Chase in
March 2008.
Panel B relates the story for Lehman Brothers. Over Q4 2007 and Q1 2008, the firm was
still expanding its balance sheet, with total assets increasing by 19.2% and net assets by 11.1%.
Furthermore, in another manifestation of increased risk taking, inventory became more illiquid,
with holdings of Level 1 assets falling by 22.0% but illiquid inventory increasing by 18.7%.
Over Q2 2008, with the fall of Bear Stearns and the market focusing its sights on Lehman
Brothers as the next likely domino, the firm reduced assets substantially, i.e., total assets by 18.7%
and net assets by 17.4%. But even in this reduction mode, the firm cut Level 1 assets by a much
higher 26.2% and illiquid inventory by a much lower 15.5%. This deleveraging did not satisfy the
market, and, in September 2008, almost immediately after reporting even smaller balance sheet
reductions over Q3 2008 (not shown), the firm was forced to file for bankruptcy.
According to Panel C, in the second half of 2007 Merrill Lynch reduced total assets by 5.2%,
but net assets increased by 5.3%, meaning that almost all of the small amount of deleveraging came
from reducing the least risky business lines, like the matched book. More importantly, Merrill Lynch
continued to increase its exposure to illiquid assets. Level 1 asset holdings fell 19.1% while illiquid
inventory increased by 19.7%. As indicated by the 30.1% decline in market capitalization, the
market did not view these changes positively.
Despite the turmoil following the fall of Bear and the market view that Merrill Lynch was a
domino not far behind Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch did little to pare its risk over the first half
of 2008. Total assets, net assets, and inventory did fall, by 5.3%, 11.4%, and 7.3%, respectively,
but these declines were driven by a 38.9% reduction in Level 1 assets. Illiquid inventory, which
was of most concern to the market, actually increased by 6.7%! Another significant fall in market
capitalization reflected the market’s lack of confidence in these adjustments as well. The firm, as
shown by its Q3 2008 balance sheet, did eventually reduce its illiquid inventory. But it was too
late. Earlier in September 2008, Merrill Lynch was forced to sell itself to Bank of America.
Like the other broker-dealers, Morgan Stanley, according to Panel D increased risk to illiquid
products in Q4 2007 and Q1 2008, reducing total and net assets by about 8%, but increasing illiquid
27

inventory by 18.4%. In response to market conditions and the fall of Bear, however, Morgan Stanley
was a lot nimbler than Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch in reducing risky and illiquid inventory.
Over Q2 2008, Morgan Stanley reduced total assets by 5.5%, net assets by a larger 9.1%, and
illiquid inventory by an even larger 14.8%. In a market generally hard on financial firms, its market
capitalization over the quarter increased by 5.3%.
Over the relative lull between the fall of Bear and Lehman’s bankruptcy, i.e., in Morgan
Stanley’s Q3 2008, the firm did continue to reduce balance sheet and did continue to rotate out of
illiquid products, but at a much reduced pace. Total assets, net assets, and illiquid inventory fell by
4.2%, 6.0%, and 6.6%, respectively. In the market turmoil after the bankruptcy of Lehman and the
absorption of Merrill Lynch, however, Morgan Stanley felt compelled to reduce risk dramatically.
Total assets fells by 33%. The reductions in the riskier and less liquid assets were also significant,
but not nearly as dramatic. Net assets fell by only 11.1%, indicating that the matched book bore
the brunt of the reduction in total assets. Furthermore, the 25.1% fall in inventory was achieved
with a 58.0% reduction in Level 1 assets and only a 9.8% reduction in illiquid inventory. Over this
tumultuous time for financial markets, the costs of selling any inventory, but particularly illiquid
inventory, were particularly punitive. Note also that, along with balance sheet reductions at this
time, Morgan Stanley raised significant amounts of equity capital.
Panel E gives the balance sheet quantities for Goldman Sachs. This story is very much like
that of Morgan Stanley. There was a rotation into more illiquid assets in Q4 2007 and Q1 2008; a
balance sheet reduction, with particular emphasis on illiquid inventory after the fall of Bear in Q2
2008; a relatively light reduction of risk in Q3 2008 – the lull between the Bear Stearns and Lehman
Brothers events – which was lighter than Morgan Stanley’s reduction over that period; and, in the
wake of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, a dramatic shrinking of the balance sheet, with significant
but smaller declines in illiquid assets, together with a simultaneous significant increase in equity.
Table 5 and Figures 7 (a) and 7 (b) tell the story of broker-dealer balance sheets over 2008
in terms of leverage rather than assets. Leverage is not a perfect measure of risk, but it is more
suitable than asset size for comparing risks and does combine the impacts of increasing equity and
asset sales.
The qualitative stories emerging from this table and these figures are the same as just related.
Firms were increasing risk leading up to the fall of Bear Stearns. In the aftermath of that event,
28

Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch reduced risk in some ways, but not sufficiently to allay market
fears. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs took somewhat of a break from risk reduction in Q3
2008, but, after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers’ in September 2008, reduced risk dramatically.
In addition to confirming these stories, the leverage data allow for a clearer comparison of
risk across firms. While Lehman Brothers looked less risky than the other firms, in the sense of
having lower net leverage, its illiquid inventory leverage was actually higher than most firms. The
implication is that the market, concerned about the quality of various categories of assets, saw
through the reported net leverage of Lehman to its real problem, as represented by its illiquid
inventory leverage.
Merrill Lynch did have much lower illiquid inventory leverage than the other firms, but was
a relative newcomer to mortgage-related assets. This meant that it held a large proportion of latevintage securities, which were the worst performing of real-estate related assets. Hence, its illiquid
inventory was worse than those at other firms, a fact not reflected in the tables or figures. This
inventory reality, in combination with its relative inexperience with the most troublesome asset
classes and its relatively high net leverage, put Merrill Lynch in a more precarious position than
that of Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs.
Figures 8 (a) and 8 (b) confirm the relationship between changes in illiquid leverage and
changes in the market’s perception of firm risk, where the latter is measured as changes in CDS
spreads. The two figures show exactly the same data points, but Figure 8 (a) shows the data by firm
while Figure 8 (b) shows the data by quarter. Focusing on Figure 8 (b), within each quarter, rising
CDS spreads are associated with increases in illiquid leverage. The exceptions to this association,
when CDS spreads widen dramatically, occurred when firms lost market confidence, i.e., Lehman
Brothers in Q2 2008 and Merrill Lynch in Q3 2008.

5.3

Illiquid Inventory and the Existence of LOLR Facilities

This paper contends that the existence of LOLR facilities allows firms to put off sales of risky
assets, effectively keeping the upside of such holdings while passing the downside risk on to others.
It is difficult to prove this contention empirically, because it is the existence of the LOLR facilities,
rather than the direct use of these facilities, that enables firms to maintain asset positions. More
precisely, when the Fed stands ready to finance certain assets, private entities will finance those
29

assets as well. Lenders feel safe financing these assets because, should they decide to withdraw
funding at any time, the borrower can always repay the loans by financing the assets at the Fed.
That the mere existence of the facilities made it easier for investment banks to fund themselves was
well understood at that time, as illustrated by statements by firm officers that are reproduced in
Appendix B. One statement also recounts how the existence of LOLR facilities bifurcated private
markets into the relatively easy funding of “Fed-eligible” assets and the relatively difficult funding
of “not Fed-eligible” assets.
Since the direct usage of LOLR facilities does not fully capture the importance of these
facilities to funding markets, evidence of opportunistic risk taking has to be somewhat anecdotal.
There is, however, an abundance of such anecdotal evidence. More specifically, broker-dealers state
throughout 2008 that they are in profit-seeking and risk-taking mode, despite the fact that LOLR
facilities have been made available – at taxpayer risk – for their survival.
A useful analogy is that of a prime broker that is financing a hedge fund that experiences
financial difficulties. The prime broker does not want to cut off financing suddenly because the
resulting fire sales would create unacceptable losses. Instead, the prime broker continues financing,
but imposes stipulations that the hedge fund has to reduce risk or, at the very least, that future
trades have to be risk reducing. This strategy allows the hedge fund to continue operations and to
recover economic value should market prices move in its favor. The stipulations, however, prevent
the hedge fund from playing the “heads I win, tails you lose” game with the prime broker.
Applying this analogy to LOLR facilities, it would not be unreasonable to require brokerdealers to reduce risk or at least to constrain them from increasing risk so long as the facilities are
directly or indirectly supporting their funding. The anecdotal evidence, however, is that brokerdealers in 2008 acted like the agents in the model of the previous section: they took the existence
of the Fed’s liquidity facilities as given and optimized risk and return from their individual, narrow
perspectives. Examples include a reluctance to reduce risk by selling assets at a loss, declarations
of the absence of regulatory pressure to reduce risk, use of the word “optionality” and reference
to market dislocations to describe risk-taking opportunities in the crisis, and parlaying access to
Fed liquidity into high spreads in funding prime brokerage customers (until conditions deteriorated
further and customers were cut off). In other words, at least to some extent, they did play the
“heads I win, tails you lose” game. Several examples of relevant statements by officers of the
30

investment banks can be found in Appendix B, but one is reproduced here as well:
As a result of the broader market dislocation, the competitive landscape has changed.
Across many of our businesses, trading margins are robust and the premium on risk
capital is higher than we’ve seen in years. In this type of environment return on assets
is improving.
– David Viniar, CFO, Goldman Sachs, Q4 Earnings Call, December 16, 2008
Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by market dislocations, the failure of competitors, and high risk premiums, without consideration of the support provided by LOLR facilities,
is particularly jarring.

5.4

Broker-Dealer Usage of LOLR Facilities

As argued in Section 5.3, the fact that direct usage of the LOLR was relatively low does not imply
that the facilities were not extremely important to the viability of the broker-dealers and to their
ability to hold and fund risky assets in a time of great market stress. Nevertheless, the actual usage
of the TSLF and PDCF are not inconsistent with the model of this paper.
Table 6 and Figure 9 show the maximum usage of the TSLF and PDCF by the various firms,
as a fraction of inventory, over the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of 2008. Lehman Brothers and Merrill
Lynch, which were the most challenged, used the facilities more than the other two firms in the
2nd and 3rd quarters. This usage reached about 10% of inventory in Q3 2008. Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs used the facilities sparingly until the quarter following Lehman Brothers’
bankruptcy, when usage rose to about 10% of inventory for Goldman Sachs and almost 30% of
inventory for Morgan Stanley.
Finally, Figure 10 shows that, consistent with the model, higher usage of the facilities is
positively associated with higher CDS spreads. In other words, weaker firms rely more heavily on
the facilities.

Exploring policies that mitigage the moral hazard from LOLR

In a typical financial crisis, the prices of certain assets fall and private market funding for those
assets evaporates. Having lost this funding, financial institutions might have to sell assets at
depressed prices to pay off their outstanding short-term debt. Furthermore, the collective selling
of these assets could trigger a downward spiral in which prices weaken further, margin calls require
financial institutions to sell even more of their assets, prices weaken again, etc.12 To forestall
this eventuality, central banks offer LOLR facilities, which, at least temporarily, enable financial
institutions to replace lost private market funding with funding at the central bank. Furthermore,
with their immediate funding pressures alleviated, financial institutions can sell assets gradually
and in a less disruptive manner, while waiting for market conditions to normalize. The point of
this paper, however, is that financial institutions have an incentive to reduce risky asset sales.
Put another way, financial institutions with access to an LOLR facility will not just slow the pace
of their asset sales to accommodate market illiquidity, but will target a smaller total quantity of
sales. We now explore two categories of policy changes to alleviate the moral hazard problem
of reduced asset sales. The first category would condition participation in LOLR facilities on
leverage reduction or asset sales. This conditioning could take three forms: prevent the most
highly-levered financial institutions from accessing LOLR facilities; set a rate of deleveraging as
a condition of continued access to LOLR facilities; or set a rate for selling assets funded through
LOLR facilities as a condition of continued access. Furthermore, whichever of these three forms
is pursued, exclude customer funding from the risk-reduction requirements. The second category
of policy changes would use LOLR facilities to encourage institutions with relatively clean balance
sheets, i.e., institutions without significant levered positions in troubled assets, to purchase those
assets. We assume that this collection of policies takes the systemic benefits of LOLR facilities as
given, aiming solely to minimize the associated moral hazard problems.

6.1

Condition LOLR Participation on Leverage Reduction or Asset Sales

The most direct mitigant of the moral hazard of reduced deleveraging is to condition LOLR borrowing, in some way, on risk reduction. The risk reduction rule has to be strict enough to offset
12

See, for example, Brunnermeier and Pederson (2009).

32

the effect described in this paper, but not so strict as to subvert the systemic benefits of the LOLR
facility. Requiring that assets funded at the facility be liquidated within a week, for example, would
likely result in the very fire sales that the facility had been designed to prevent.
Policy makers have in the past, to a very limited extent, imposed deleveraging condition on
LOLR facilities. The Fed’s PDCF program, for example, was opened in March 2008 “for a minimum
period of six months, which “may be extended as conditions warrant.13 Setting a finite term for the
program can be viewed as instructing primary dealers to stabilize their balance sheets over that
term. The perception that the Fed would extend the program, however, weakened the deleveraging
message of setting a program termination date. In fact, the program was extended four times
and acceptable collateral was once expanded before the program was terminated in February 2010.
Similarly, while the ECB started its LTRO with one-year repo loans, it subsequently supplied two
rounds of three-year repo loans and is currently contemplating another round. The theoretical and
empirical analysis of this paper can help explore policies aimed at combating the tendency of banks
to slow or postpone asset sales and deleveraging. We explore a few specific policies along these
lines:

6.1.1

Prevent the Most Highly-Levered Firms From Accessing LOLR Facilities

Figure 2 (a) illustrated that a bank with very high leverage would not deleverage at all. Section 5
showed that Lehman Brothers, the investment bank with the highest illiquid inventory leverage, was
very slow in deleveraging its worst assets. And Acharya, Fleming, Hrung, and Sarkar (2011) show
that the most highly-levered banks use LOLR the most. Therefore, to the extent that providing
liquidity to the set of stronger banks is consistent with systemic stability, moral hazard can be
mitigated by imposing a leverage threshold over which access to LOLR would be denied. Excluding
the banks that are leveraged much more highly than their peers not only reduces the moral hazard
of LOLR facility utilization, but also reduces the moral hazard of ex-ante investment decisions.
Knowing that being more leveraged than one’s peers might mean being barred from future safety
nets would constrain risk-taking actions before a bust. Note that these leverage constraints could
apply not just at the initiation of the LOLR facility, but over its life. This would mean that a
bank might initially qualify for the facility, but then, by allowing its leverage to rise excessively, be
13

Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2008)

33

barred from future participation.

6.1.2

Set a Rate of Deleveraging as a Conditon of Access to LOLR Facilities

The public policy motivation for LOLR facilities is to prevent destabilizing fire sales of assets in
response to shortages of liquidity. Maintaining balance sheets at their current levels and protecting
banks against losses from asset sales are not typically cited as public policy objectives. Therefore,
deleveraging requirements could be set so as as to mitigate the moral hazard problem discussed in
this paper without jeopardizing systemic stability. More specifically, central banks might require
that illiquid inventory leverage be reduced over some time period by a percentage of the leverage
supported through its facilities. Say, for example, that a bank had 100 in illiquid assets and 10 in
capital for a leverage of 10, with 20 of those assets, or 2 leverage points, being funded through the
LOLR facility. Then the central bank might require that the bank reduce leverage by 10% of those
2 leverage points, or 0.2, over the following six months.

6.1.3

Set a Rate for Selling Assets Funded by LOLR as a Conditon of Access

The previous policy focuses on leverage as a proxy for risk when borrowing through an LOLR
facility. In addition, leverage can be reduced not only by asset sales, but by raising capital as well.
And, given the policy objective of minimizing disruptive asset sales in a crisis, raising capital should
certainly be encouraged as an alternative to outsized asset sales. Leverage, however, is relatively
difficult to monitor and can be subject to gaming. With respect to monitoring, many banks
compute leverage accurately only at quarter end. With respect to gaming, banks can manipulate
various quantities that enter into leverage calculations, e.g., the classification of assets into liquidity
buckets, the use of derivatives instead of cash assets, the reduction of assets around reporting dates,
etc. An alternative, simpler condition for access to LOLR facilities, therefore, could be a schedule
of asset sales. A bank funding $100 in illiquid assets at the central bank might, for example, be
required to sell 10% or $10 of risky assets over the subsequent six months. This rule can be refined
to require sales in each of several broad categories of assets in proportion to LOLR borrowing in
each of those categories.

34

6.1.4

Exclude Customer Funding from Risk-Reduction Conditions

Banks can use access to LOLR facilities to fund both their own positions as well as their customer
positions. From a policy perspective, however, it is more important to control LOLR funding
of bank positions. First, the moral hazard effect described in this paper is much more relevant
to banks’ own positions. Should a bank lose funding for its own positions, it suffers losses from
premature and suboptimal trade termination and from the market impact of associated fire sales.
On the other hand, should a bank lose funding for customer positions, it loses the less profitable
(and less risky) fee income from that business line. Second, banks are likely to pose greater systemic
risk than the vast majority of their customers. Third, since banks have strong incentives of their
own to monitor the risks of loans to customers, the central bank will probably not add much value
along those lines. Fourth, there is a public policy interest in maintaining the indirect access that
healthy bank customers have to LOLR facilities so that they can purchase some of the distressed
assets that banks are selling. For all these reasons then, when banks are required to delever or to
sell assets as a condition of obtaining LOLR funding, these requirements should apply to their own
rather than their customer accounts. This distinction can be implemented easily as total loans to
customers are routinely monitored and reported. Returning to an earlier example, say that a bank
is funding $100 of assets at the central bank, $60 for customers and $40 for its own account. Then
the central bank might require that 10% of the $40 of assets, or $4 of assets, be sold over the next
six months.

6.2

Opening LOLR Facilities to Potential Asset Purchasers

The examples of this paper with an endogenous asset price show that giving banks access to LOLR
facilities can raise the price of the illiquid asset but lower the quantity that banks sell. By contrast,
giving the potential purchasers of the asset access to LOLR facilities can raise the price and raise the
quantity traded. This outcome dominates from a public policy perspective: the higher price relieves
fire-sale pressures and the higher quantity traded reduces risk at the vulnerable and systemically
important banks.
In some sense central banks offer potential purchasers indirect access to LOLR facilities
through banks that have direct access. But this indirect access depends on the cooperation of banks

35

that, particularly during a crisis, have their own agenda. And the anecdotal evidence presented in
this paper shows that investment banks cut back on customer funding at the height of the crisis.
Therefore, to achieve the better LOLR outcome of higher asset prices and greater quantities traded,
central banks would do well to give potential asset purchasers direct access to LOLR facilities.
There were, in fact, two Fed programs during the crisis that provided direct funding to
asset purchasers, namely, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and the Money Market
Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF). To the extent that the CPFF was applied to asset-backed
commercial paper, these programs were very much motivated by the considerations discussed here.
Furthermore, the size of the CPFF was significant, although the MMIFF never did make any
loans. Nevertheless, these programs cannot be said to have shifted LOLR from supporting troubled
financial institutions to supporting asset purchasers. First, the CPFF bought a lot of commercial
paper sold by financial institutions and asset-backed commercial paper sold by conduits, which were
largely the creations of traditional financial intermediaries. Second, the simultaneous existence of
significant LOLR facilities directed at bank and investment banks, like the bank discount window,
the TSLF, and the PDCF, meant that the overall set of LOLR facilities was not particularly
designed to encourage troubled financial institutions to sell assets to healthier, potential purchasers
of their assets.14
The earliest conception of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) was very much consistent with such logic. More specifically, the original plan for TARP was for the government –
on its own or in partnership with private entities – to purchase illiquid assets from the market.
That this plan was eventually discarded, however, should not be construed to mean that such purchases are impractical. First, Ben Bernanke, Henry Paulson, and others, even before TARP had
passed Congress, had shifted their objectives from asset purchases to injecting equity into troubled
financial institutions. Second, while the implementation of large-scale asset purchases proved more
difficult and time consuming than originally anticipated, all of that planning had to be done as
the crisis unfolded. Should the policy of this paper be adopted, the planning could begin much
14

There are some operational hurdles in providing LOLR loans to institutions that do not usually interact with the
Fed. But these can be overcome, as they were with the CPFF, by having banks and investment banks act as agents
for these loans. See, for example, Adrian, Kimbrough, and Marchioni (2011). Note that this agency model is very
different from having banks and investment banks use their own balance sheets to provide indirect LOLR to their
customers, which transmission mechanism is not, as discussed earlier, very reliable in a crisis.

Conclusion

In this paper, we examined theoretically and empirically an unintended consequence of LOLR
policies: if such policies are not suitably conditioned on borrowers financial health, then they could
result in a slow-down of deleveraging by the borrowers and increase their illiquid leverage and risk of
default. Several mechanisms to deal with this consequence were explored: provide LOLR financing
only to relatively healthier borrowers or condition LOLR terms on their health; condition access to
LOLR facilities on a certain quantity of asset sales or financial deleveraging; and, provide LOLR
financing to healthy, potential buyers of illiquid assets. There are several directions in which the
present work could be extended to enhance understanding of the optimal design of LOLR policies.
First, to design LOLR policy to balance the ex-ante moral hazard and the ex-post spillover
containment from financial failures (e.g., due to contagion), it would be useful to model the
spillovers. This could help specify a regulatory objective function as the expected output of the
system, which is affected by both the greater risk due to the moral hazard effect and the reduced
spillover costs from access to LOLR facilities when private funding dries up. It is most likely the
case that, in general, moral hazard would have to be contained even if not entirely eliminated as
Fischer (1999) observes so that optimal LOLR support may be limited. (Formally, an interior
level of “l” would be optimal in the model.) It may also be optimal to combine LOLR policy with
macro-prudential supervision and tools such as capital requirements so as to contain the ex-ante
risks from LOLR policy.
Second, limited LOLR support might conceivably be achieved through “constructive ambiguity in whether LOLR would be extended or not. Such ambiguity, however, often lacks time
consistency and may not be credible. A more pragmatic approach might be to limit the scope of
the LOLR, for instance, by restricting it – in an ex-ante and credible manner – to specific collateral
types or to borrowers of adequate financial health. This could be seen as the likely intent of the
Dodd-Frank Act’s restrictions on the Federal Reserve’s 13(3) exceptional powers to provide LOLR
financing to individual non-banks, like AIG Financial Products, although the results here suggest
15

For an account of the history of TARP, see, for example, Paulson (2010).

37

that restrictions based on borrower health rather than organizational form would be more efficient.
Finally, if financial firms delever less due to access to LOLR facilities, they might also, over
time, become more dependent on these facilities. The recent calls for the ECB to extend its threeyear LTRO, so that troubled banks in Spain and Italy can continue to roll over their holdings of
risky sovereign debt, appear to be a case in point. Put another way, it is difficult to unwind large
scale LOLR facilities gracefully. This is precisely why this paper argues as does Fischer (1999)
that LOLR policy must pay careful attention to the moral hazard consequences of its support of
the financial sector.

From the proof of Proposition 1, we can substitute expressions for

to solve for

dα∗
dl :

dα∗
(eI − α)3 (1 − l)x22 g(uB ) + (eI − α)2 (B − eL − eI p)(−x22 (1 − l)g 0 (uB ))
=

−(B − eL − eI p)2 ((1 − l)x2 g 0 (uB ) − g(uB ))
∂uB dα∗
(eI − α)(1 − l)x22 g(uB ) + (B − eL − eI p)(−x22 (1 − l)g 0 (uB ))
⇒

 I

duB
(e − α)(1 − l)x2 g(uB ) + (B − eL − eI p)(−x2 (1 − l)g 0 (uB ))
⇒
= −x2 + x2
dl
−(B − eL − eI p)((1 − l)x2 g 0 (uB ) − g(uB ))
Observing the term inside the brackets, we note by the solvency condition that:

(eI − α)(1 − l)x2 > (B − eL − eI p)
⇔

(eI − α)(1 − l)x2 g(uB ) + (B − eL − eI p)(−x2 (1 − l)g 0 (uB )) >
−(B − eL − eI p)((1 − l)x2 g 0 (uB ) − g(uB ))

Thus, unless we are in a corner region in which α∗ = 0 and

dα∗
dl

= 0, we have our result.

Appendix B: Additional Quotations
B1. Quotations illustrating the focus on the quality of assets on the balance
sheet
During the quarter, we sold a variety of assets, not just the most liquid. We sold $4.2 billion of
loans, of which 45% were mezzanine loans and 55% were senior loans. . . [W]e sold approximately $3.5
billion of level 3 assets and also had additional writedowns of approximately $2 billion . . . however,
this reduction will be offset by net transfers in and other activity of approximately $3.5 billion.
– Ian Lowitt, CFO, Lehman Brothers, Q2 2008 Earnings Call

40

Prashant Bhatia (Citigroup): The gross long CDO exposure was down about $6 billion. Can
you breakout what drove the decline and the same on the short side that was down by about $4
billion?
John Thain (Chairman and CEO, Merrill Lynch): There are sales, but it is mostly markdowns.
– Merrill Lynch, Q2 2008 Earnings Call

We continued to reduce concentrated risk positions including leverage in Real Estate related
loans. These asset classes represented 57% of tangible common equity at year-end down from 85%
in the third quarter and 224% at year-end 2007. Legacy leverage loan exposure now stands at $7
billion, down from $52 billion at its peak last year. Our commercial Real Estate portfolio declined
by approximately 25% to $10.9 billion in the fourth quarter alone.
– David Viniar, CFO, Goldman Sachs, Q4 2008 Earnings Call

B2. On the Importance of the Existence of LOLR Facilities for Private Funding
Markets
In addition to [our] conservative risk framework, the Federal Reserve’s announcement on Sunday
has introduced policies that go even further in mitigating our liquidity risk. The Fed has agreed
to accept in the PDCF a broad range of collateral. . . So while our access to funding continues to
be quite robust, the Fed’s actions greatly diminished the liquidity risk associated with our secured
funding book. . .
[I]t is not like we have assets sitting there that we need to take to the Fed. But I think the
Fed being there is really a big statement about liquidity risk. I’ve seen reports. I’ve seen articles
about tri-party repo is too risky; it is going away. I have never given any of them any weight. But
with the Fed doing that it kind of takes away most of that risk – if you thought it was there.
– David Viniar, CFO, Goldman Sachs, Q3 Earnings Call, September 16, 2008

The most difficult to fund non-central bank eligible assets which includes capital commitments
and other receivables represents roughly 10% of our funding needs and had a weighted average

41

maturity of greater than 90 days.
– Colm Kelleher, CFO, Morgan Stanley, Q3 Earnings Call, September 16, 2008

B3. Investment Banks Felt Free to Optimize Risk and Return Without Incorporating the Goals of and the Risks to the Liquidity Facilities
[The] Federal Reserve’s decision to create a lending facility for primary dealers and permit a broad
range of investment-grade securities to serve as collateral improves the liquidity picture, and, from
my perspective, takes the liquidity issue for the entire industry off the table.
– Dick Fuld, ”Wall Street Watches Lehman Walk on Thin Ice,” MarketWatch, The Wall
Street Journal, March 17, 2008

Meredith Whitney (Oppenheimer): Could you set a market by hitting whatever cash bid
there is out there and just get it over with?
John Thain (Chairman and CEO, Merrill Lynch): No, I do not think we want to do dumb
things and so we have been balanced in terms of what we sold and at what prices we sold them.
We have not simply liquidated stuff at any price we could get. At some point some of the return
profiles that people want. . . you would not want us to sell the assets. We will continue to sell assets
but in a way that makes sense from generating returns to our shareholders.
– Merrill Lynch, Q2 2008 Earnings Call, July 17, 2008

Michael Hecht (Bank of America): [S]hould we expect leverage to continue to fall? What. . . [are]
the implications for the type of ROE you guys can earn through this cycle? Are you seeing any
pressure here from regulators, rating agencies, investors, to bring leverage down further?
Colm Kelleher (CFO, Morgan Stanley): Well we are obviously in constant touch with a broad
array of regulators. . . what we’ve been doing is taking down the balance sheet because on a riskadjusted basis, that’s what we want to do. . . So the answer is we’re in constant dialogue but we’re
not getting any pressure in terms of the cycle ROE.
– Morgan Stanley, Q2 2008 Earning Call, June 18, 2008

We are still placing a significant emphasis on our capital and liquidity to ensure that we
have enough dry powder to continue investing in our businesses and to take advantage of attractive
risk-adjusted opportunities . . .
People cannot gloss over lightly the event that took place in March and the effect that had
on the market . . . So that is what made us pull down the sails, sail close to shore, preserve our
ammunition. We do have excess capital, we do have excess liquidity, we do have leverage if we want
to where we can take risk . . .
So I’m not saying we’re in risk reduction model; we clearly have reduced the risk, we’ve
reduced the balance sheet, we’re liquid, we’ve got capital, we clearly feel we can make money
through bear cycles and bull cycles and we’re just waiting for the right risk-adjusted opportunity
to come along . . .
I kind of think we’re in the right sort of spot at the moment in terms of giving us the
optionality we need to be opportunistic and to be defensive. Obviously we’d like a more normalized
market to get rid of some of this legacy portfolio so we can optimize return to the balance sheet.
But I think we feel comfortable that we’ve got optionality sitting where we are at the moment given
all the uncertainty around it . . .
Some of these [market] prices, frankly, have got to silly and irrational levels so we’re going to
have the ability to take advantage of that . . .
– Colm Kelleher, CFO, Morgan Stanley, Q2 2008 Earnings Call, June 18, 2008

. . . what we will do with our exposures and our risk will really depend on the opportunities
we see in the market . . . if we see opportunities we will take advantage of it and increase risk and
if we think opportunities are not as good, we’ll decrease risk.
– David Viniar, CFO, Goldman Sachs, Q2 Earnings Call, June 17, 2008

Given our significant reduction of legacy assets and our lack of direct consumer exposure, we
believe that our balance sheet is strong. Importantly, we have significant capital to take advantage
of market opportunities as they arrive in 2009 . . . As a result of the broader market dislocation,

43

the competitive landscape has changed. Across many of our businesses, trading margins are robust
and the premium on risk capital is higher than we’ve seen in years. In this type of environment
return on assets is improving.
– David Viniar, CFO, Goldman Sachs, Q4 Earnings Call, December 16, 2008

Global Markets Financing and Services revenues increased to a record level, up approximately
25% from the prior-year period, as the firm took advantage of opportunities to both add clients
and increase average balances.
– Merrill Lynch, Q2 2008 Press Release, July 17, 2008

Prashant Bhatia (Citigroup): On the prime brokerage side, it looks like . . . record revenues
even coming off of seasonally strong last quarter, how much of that is share gain versus pricing?
Colm Kelleher (CFO, Morgan Stanley): Pretty much pricing to be honest; not share gain.
– Morgan Stanley, Q3 2008 Earnings Call, September, 16, 2008

[Morgan Stanley was] targeting . . . capital to businesses where [it] has leading positions and
where the Firm believes it will have better risk-adjusted returns . . . engaging in a deliberate and
focused reduction of balance sheet-intensive businesses including a resizing of Prime Brokerage, the
exit of select Proprietary Trading strategies, the reduction of Principal Investments and the closure
of Residential Mortgage Origination.
– Q4 Earnings Press Release, Morgan Stanley, December 17, 2008

Roger Freeman (Barclays Capital): With respect to the balance sheet decline this quarter
can you help us think about some of the buckets there?
Colm Kelleher (CFO, Morgan Stanley): Our adjusted leverage has come down as well. So it
was broad. It is easier to reduce a matched book which we did but if you think about it in terms of
where we are it was pretty broad based. About half the reduction came from a reduction in prime
brokerage balances and the rest is pretty much spread out.
