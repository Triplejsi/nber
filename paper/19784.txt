A Note on Variance Estimation for the Oaxaca Estimator of Average Treatment Effects

JEL No. C01,J31,J7
ABSTRACT
We derive the limiting distribution of the Oaxaca estimator of average treatment effects studied by
Kline (2011). A consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance is proposed that makes use of standard
regression routines. It is shown that ignoring uncertainty in group means will tend to lead to an overstatement
of the asymptotic standard errors. Monte Carlo experiments examine the finite sample performance
of competing approaches to inference.

Introduction

In a seminal contribution, Oaxaca (1973) proposed estimation of counterfactual means by applying the
regression coefficients of one demographic group to the mean covariates of another.1 Kline (2011) showed
that a variant of Oaxaca’s technique corresponds to a “doubly robust” estimator of average treatment effects
– estimation is consistent if either mean untreated outcomes or the odds of treatment are linear in the
covariates. An attractive feature of the Oaxaca estimator of treatment effects is that it relies on simple
regression based methods that are easy to implement and adapt to the needs of a particular application.
Several recent studies apply the Oaxaca estimator of treatment effects to program evaluation problems
(e.g. Angrist and Rokkanen, 2012; Busso, Gregory, and Kline, 2013; Kline and Moretti, forthcoming),
however no formal discussion of the estimator’s asymptotic properties has yet been provided. This note
derives the limiting distribution of the Oaxaca estimator of average treatment effects and proposes a simple
computational approach to variance estimation. It is shown that ignoring the variability of the mean values
of covariates will tend to lead to an overstatement of asymptotic standard errors.2 Monte Carlo results are
provided to illustrate the relative performance of competing approaches to inference.

Setup
N

The data are a triple {Yi , Xi , Di }i=1 where Yi is a scalar outcome, Xi a K × 1 vector of covariates which is
assumed to include an intercept, and Di a scalar indicator for treatment status with one indicating treated.
We assume throughout that all variables have finite second moments and that E [Xi Xi0 |Di = 0] is full rank.
Our parameter of interest is:
0
θ ≡ µ1y − µ10
xβ
−1

where µ1y ≡ E [Yi |Di = 1], µ1x ≡ E [Xi |Di = 1], and β 0 ≡ E [Xi Xi0 |Di = 0] E [Xi Yi |Di = 0]. To relate this
to Oaxaca (1973)’s original framework, note that if one takes Yi is log wages and Di as an indicator for being
female then this quantity corresponds to the difference between women’s actual mean wages and their mean
predicted wage based upon the regression coefficients governing the population of men. Quantities such as θ
have traditionally been used to detect labor market discrimination but can more generally be thought of as
measures of average causal effects. Kline (2011) discusses the conditions under which θ identifies the average
treatment effect on the treated – a standard estimand in program evaluation (Heckman and Robb, 1985).
The sample analogue of θ is:

Hence, by the Delta method:
1 A large subsequent literature on decomposition methods reviewed by Fortin, Lemieux, and Firpo (2011) extends Oaxaca’s
original contribution, focusing most recently on identification and estimation of distributional counterfactuals.
2 In a related result, Wooldridge (2002, 2007) shows the conditions under which variance estimates ignoring sampling uncertainty in an estimated propensity score will tend to yield conservative inference. The present analysis considers the effects of
ignoring sampling uncertainty in the mean value of covariates which corresponds to one component of the Oaxaca estimator’s
implicit propensity score estimate.

Asymptotically, there are three sources of uncertainty: i) variability in the treated mean outcome

− µ1y , ii) variability in the regression coefficients among the untreated sample β̂ 0 − β 0 , and iii) vari
ability in the covariate means in the treatment group µ̂1x − µ1x . In general, these three sources of variability
may be correlated, which gives rise to the following asymptotic variance expression:

Because the estimator is asymptotically linear, bootstrap techniques can be applied (see Theorem 23.5
in Van Der Vaart, 2000). However, the bootstrap can be computationally expensive relative to analytical
estimates. Furthermore, it is sometimes of interest to obtain analytical variance estimates for use in obtaining
an asymptotic refinement via the bootstrap.

Ignoring uncertainty in the group means

It is common (e.g.,
 Oaxaca and Ransom, 1994, 1998) for researchers to ignore the variability in the group
means µ̂1x − µ1x , which implies dropping the terms β 00 Vx β 0 − 2β 00 Vxy − 2β 00 Vβx µ1x from Vθ .3 We show
now that this will tend to lead to an over -estimate of the asymptotic sampling error. To see this, note first
0
that typically Vβx = 0 because µ̂10
x and β̂ are estimated on separate samples that are independent of one
−1
4
another. Suppose that this is the case. Define β 1 ≡ E [Xi Xi0 |Di = 1] E [Xi Yi |Di = 1] as the regression
coefficient among the treated units. If the data are independent across observations, then we can write
Vxy = Vx β 1 .5 Hence β 00 Vxy = β 00 Vx β 1 . Thus, for β 0 ≈ β 1 , we have β 00 Vx β 0 − 2β 00 Vxy = −β 00 Vx β 0 which
implies the sampling variance that ignores the variability in the group means will be too large whenever the
regression coefficients in the treated and untreated samples are close to one another – which will typically
be the case.
Thus, it is possible to conduct conservative inference based on plugin estimators of V naive ≡ Vy +
10
µx Vβ µ1x − 2µ10
x Vβy . This is easily accomplished in standard regression packages by running a regression of Yi
on Di and the elements of (1 − Di ) Xi without a constant. Heuristically, the standard error on the coefficient
accompanying Di provides an estimate of Vy , the covariance matrix for the coefficients accompanying the
elements of (1 − Di ) Xi provide estimates of Vβ , and the covariance between these two sets of coefficients
provide estimates of Vβy . Note that in the absence of clustering or cross-sectional dependence Vβy = 0.
Finally, one simply plugs in sample means as estimates of µ1x to obtain the composite variance estimate
V̂ naive .

Full variance estimation

To derive the full asymptotic variance, note that:
3 It

is important to note that there is a distinction between ignoring uncertainty in the group means µ̂x and in conditioning on
the underlying covariates Xi themselves. If one wishes to conduct inference conditional on an experimental design {Di , Xi }N
i=1
1
10
it is necessary to estimate Vθ|x ≡ Vy|x + µ10
x Vβ|x µx − 2µx Vβy|x where Vy|x , Vβ|x , and Vβy|x give conditional asymptotic
variances. In general Vy ≥ Vy|x and so one will again tend to overestimate the conditional asymptotic variance by simply
ignoring variability in the group means µ̂x . See Abadie, Imbens, and Zheng (2011) for further discussion.
4 They may however be correlated if they are in the same clusters or share some other form of cross-sectional dependence.
However, for Vβx

 6= 0 one also needs for the regression model for the control sample to be misspecified so that

A computational trick

The above calculations are rather tedious. Fortunately, standard regression software can be used to compute
the necessary variance estimates in a simple way. The following regression based procedure will provide an
estimate of Vθ :
1) Estimate β̂ 0 via OLS in the untreated
sample.


∗
0 0
2) Form a new variable Yi = Di Yi − Xi β̂ + (1 − Di ) Yi .
3) Regress Yi∗ on Di and the elements of (1 − Di ) Xi without a constant using an appropriate variance
estimation technique (e.g. clustering).
4) The coefficient on Di provides the Oaxaca point estimate θ̂ with (in an abuse of notation) corresponding
variance estimate V̂θ̂ which (given appropriate regularity conditions) will be consistent for the term in (1).
The coefficients on the elements of (1 − Di ) Xi provide estimates of β̂ 0 with corresponding variance estimate
−1
−1
V̂β̂ which will be consistent for the term E [(1 − Di )Xi Xi0 ] V(1−d)x(y−x0 b) E [(1 − Di )Xi Xi0 ] in (2). The
regression also supplies an estimate of V̂β̂ θ̂ which will be zero unless some form of cross-sectional dependence
−1

is allowed. V̂β̂ θ̂ will be consistent for the term E [Xi Xi0 |Di = 0]
5) The full variance estimate is computed as V̂θ̂ +

Monte Carlo

We now consider the performance of the proposed Oaxaca variance estimator in a simple Monte Carlo
simulation design. The data generating process is given by:

Yi

=

Di

=

(1)

(1)

2 + (1 − Di ) (2Xi ) + Di (3Xi ) + ηc(i) + εi
h
i
(2)
1 ηc(i) + vi > 0 ,
(2)

where vi ∼ N (0, 1), and εi , ηc , and ηc are each drawn from independent students-t distributions with
six degrees of freedom. This design ensures a within cluster correlation in both the treatment Di and the
1
composite regression error ηc(i)
+ εi , which necessitates cluster robust inference. Because treatment varies
within cluster, it is possible for Vβy 6= 0. As noted by Chesher (1995), Monte Carlo experiments utilizing
symmetrically distributed
covariates are likely to give overly optimistic results. To avoid this problem, we

set Xi = 4 Xi∗ − 27 + Di where Xi∗ ∼ Beta (2, 5), which yields a regressor with a substantial amount of
skew and a reasonable amount of predictive power.6 In this design, the differences between β 0 and β 1 and
the fact that µ1x = 1 imply the population value of θ equals one.
Table I reports simulation results for several different sample sizes. In all cases each cluster has exactly
10 observations. Columns (3) and (4) use the regression based procedure of Section 5 to compute variance
estimates, while columns (5) and (6) use the procedure of Section 3 which ignores the uncertainty in the
sample means µ̂1x .7 As column (1) indicates, the Oaxaca point estimates θ̂ are essentially unbiased in this
design. Unsurprisingly, the standard error estimates summarized in column (3) slightly underestimate the
true variability of the estimator when few clusters are present, leading to mild over-rejection of hypothesis
tests. With 100 clusters, the standard error estimates yield nearly exact coverage. As expected, ignoring
uncertainty in the mean value of the covariate increases the estimated standard errors, which leads to underrejection. In this case, the problem is relatively mild, with a 6-7% over-estimate of the true asymptotic
standard error. Interestingly, although ignoring uncertainty in µ̂1x asymptotically inflates the standard error
estimate, it does not always do so in finite samples, as column (7) makes clear.

Conclusion

The Oaxaca estimator of average treatment effects studied by Kline (2011) is a simple alternative to matching
and inverse probability weighting methods in evaluation problems involving selection on observables. This
note derived the estimator’s limiting distribution. A simple computational approach to standard error
calculation was proposed that makes use of conventional statistical routines. Naive routines that ignore
variability in the mean values of the covariates are likely to yield conservative inferences.
