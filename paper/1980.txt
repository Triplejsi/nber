Irreversible Investment, Capacity Choice, and the Value of the Firm

ABSTRACT

A model

of capacity choice and utilization is developed

consistent with value maximization when investment is irreversible
and future demand is uncertain.
Investment requires the full
value of a marginal unit of capacity to be at least as large as
its full cost. The former includes the value of the firms option
not to utilize the unit, and the latter includes the opportunity

cost of exercising the investment option.
We show that for
moderate amounts of uncertainty, the firm's optimal capacity is
much smaller than it would be if investment were reversible, and a
large fraction of the firirVs value is due to the possibility of
future growth.
We also characterize the behavior of capacity and
capacity utilization, and discuss implications far the measurement
of marginal cost and Tobin's q.

Introduction.

When investment is irreversible and future demand

conditions are

uncertain, a firms investment expenditure involves the exercising, or
11killing," of an option (the option to productively invest). One gives up
the option of waiting for new information (about

evolving demand and cost

conditions), and using that information to re—evaluate the desirability
and/or timing of the expenditure. This lost option value must be included
as part of the cast of the investment. As a result, the standard investment

rule "Invest when the marginal value of a unit of capital is at least as

large as the purchase and installation cost of the unit" is not valid.

Instead the marginal value of the unit must exceed
installation cost by an amount equal to the value of

the purchase and
keeping the firms

option to invest alive —— an opportunity cost of investing.
This aspect of investment has been explored in

an emerging literature,

and most notably in the recent paper by McDonald and Siegel (1986). They

show that with even moderate levels of

uncertainty, the value of this

opportunity cost can be large, and an investment rule that ignores it will
be grossly in error.

Their calculations, and those in the related papers by

Brennan and Schwartz (1985) and Maid and Pindyck (1985), show that in many

cases projects should be undertaken only when their present value is at
least double their direct cost.1

The existing literature has been concerned with investment decisions
involving discrete prijects, e.g. whether to build a factory.

Ihis paper

examines the implications of irreversibility for capacity choice, e.g. how
large a factory to build. In particular I focus on the marginal investment

decision. This provides a simple and intuitively appealing solution to the

—2—
optimal capacity problem, as well as insight into the sources and evolution

of the firm's value.

In addition, it clarifies issues related to the

measurement of long—run marginal cost, and the interpretation and measurement of Tobins q.

A firm's capacity choice is optimal when the value of the marginal
unit of capacity is just equal to the total cost of that unit. This total
cost includes the purchase and installation cost, plus the opportunity cost
of exercising the option to buy the unit.

therefore involves two steps.

An analysis of capacity choice

First, the value of a marginal unit of

capacity must be determined, given that the firm already has capacity K.
To do this we must account for the fact that if demand unexpectedly falls,
the unit of capacity may be unutilized. Second, the value of the option to

invest in the marginal unit must be determined (it will depend in part on
the value of the marginal unit itself), together with the decision rule for

exercising the option. In essence, this decision rule is the solution to
the optimal capacity problem.

Because a marginal unit of capacity need not be utilized, it is worth

more when demand fluctuates stochastically. This might suggest that the
firm should hold more capacity when future demand is uncertain, but in fact

the opposite is true.

The reason is that uncertainty also increases the

opportunity cost of exercising the option to invest in a marginal unit.
Although the value of the marginal unit increases, this opportunity cost

increases even more, so the net effect is to reduce the firm's optimal
capacity.2 Indeed, for many product markets the volatility of demand is

such that firms should hold far less capacity than standard investment
models would suggest.

-3—
This model of capacity choice also has implications for the valuation
of firms. The value of a firm has two components:

the value of installed

capacity, and the value of the firm's options to install more capacity in

the future. Solutions of the model based on plausible

parameter values

suggest that for typical firms, "growth options" should account for more
that half (and in some cases much more than half) of market value.

This paper, like others cited above, stresses the options that firms
have to productively invest.

These options are important assets of firms.

Firms hold them even if they are price—takers in product and input markets,

and they can account for a good fraction of their market value. What gives
firms these options? It may be a patent on a particular production technology, or ownership of land or natural resource reserves. Rut more general-

ly, a firm's managerial resources and expertise, reputation, market posi-

tion, and possibly scale, all of which may have been built up over time,
enable it to productively undertake investments that individuals

or other

firms cannot undertake.3

The next section lays out a simple model of capacity choice with
irreversible investment, based on the assumption that firms maximize their
market value.

It differs from previous models of this type, e.g. Brennan

and Schwartz (1985) and McDonald and Siegel (1986), in that the focus is on

the marginal investment decision, rather than the decision to invest in

a

discrete project. As the model is developed, a numerical example is used to

show how the marginal value of capital, the opportunity cost of investing,
and the firm's optimal capacity depend on current demand and uncetainty over
future demand.

Remaining sections of the paper use the model to study the

value of the firm, the behavior of capacity and capacity utilization over

—4—
time, and implications for the measurement of

marginal

cost and Tobins q.

4 Model of Capacity Choice.

2.

Consider the investment decisions of a firm that might have monopoly
power, and faces the following demand function:4

6(t)

P =

—

Cl)

(The firm might be a price—taker, in which case

=

0.)

Here 6(t) evolves

over time according to the following stochastic process:
=

a$dt

+

(2)

cr9dz

where d: is the increment of a Weiner process, i.e. dz =
c(t)

a

(t)(dt)1'2,

with

serially uncorrelated and normally distributed random variable.

Eqn. (2)

says that the current value of 9 (and thus the current demand

function) is known to the firm, but future values of

e are

unknown, and are

lognormally distributed with a variance that grows with the time horizon.

Thus even though information arrives over time (the firm observes 9
changing) ,

future demand is always uncertain, as is the case in most

real—world markets.'

Denote by g.. the correlation of 6 with the market portfolio. Now
suppose some asset or portfolio of assets exists with a stochastic return
perfectly correlated with , so that if x is the price of this asset, it
evolves according to:

dx =

pxdt

+

oxdz

By the CPM, the expected return on this asset must be p =

r

+

where

is the market price of risk. We will assume that u, the expected percen-

tage rate of change of 9,

is less than p.

(It will become clear later

that if this were not the case, no firm in the industry would ever install

—5-.
any capacity. No matter what the current level of $,

firms

would always be

better off waiting and simply holding the option to install capacity in the
future.) Denote the difference between p and

by 8, i.e. 8 = p — c.

The firms problem is to determine, initially and over time, its
optimal investment spending on new production capacity.

I assume that the

firm starts with no capacity, so that at t = 0 it decides how much initial

capacity to put in place. Later it may or may not add more capacity,
depending on how demand evolves.
For simplicity

I assume that new capacity can be installed instantly,

and capital in place does not depreciate.' Another assumption ——

important one ——

is

and an

that investment is irreversible. That is, although

capital in place can be sold by one firm to another, its scrap value is
small because it has no alternative use than that originally intended for

it. Thus a factory built to produce widgets can only be used to produce
widgets, so if the demand for widgets falls, its market value will fall.

The fact that investment is irreversible implies that there is an
opportunity cost associated with adding capacity —— adding

capacity today

forecloses the possibility of adding it instead at some point in the future

(or never at all). Put another way, the firm currently has options to
install capacity at various points in the future (options that can be
exercised at the cost of purchasing the capital), and by installing capacity

now, it closes those options. The optimal rule is to invest until the value
of a marginal unit of capital is equal to its total cost ——

the purchase and

installation cost, plus the value of the option on the unit.1
A few more details are needed to finish specifying the model:

unit of capital can be bought at a fixed price k per unit;

(i) each

(ii) each unit

—6—
of capital in place provides the capacity to produce one unit of output per

time period; and (iii) the firm has an operating cost C(Q)

(1/2)c202.

In general c1 and/or c2 can be zero, but if

c1Q +

= 0 (so the firm

is a price—taker), we require c2 > 0 to bound the firm's size.

For purposes of comparison, note that if future demand were certain
(a

0), and if c > 0,

rk)/(2+c2)

= (9 — c1 —
9(K)

:

(2+c2)K

the firm's optimal initial capital stock would be

+

c1

+

rk.

i.e. the firm should add capacity only if

We will see that with moderate amounts of

uncertainty over future demand, the optimal capital stock is considerably
smaller than this.

The Value of a Marginal Unit of Capacity.

To solve the firm's investment problem we first determine the value of

an incremental unit of capacity. That is, given that the firm already has
capacity K, we want to find the value to the firm of an incremental unit,

which we denote by V(K). (Note that V(K) is a function of 9 as well as
K.) This is just the present value of the expected flow of incremental
profits from the marginal unit.

Because the unit does not have to be

utilized, future incremental profits are a nonlinear function of 8, which is

stochastic. In particular, given a current capacity K, the incremental
profit at any future time t resulting from a marginal unit of capacity is:

max CO, (8 — (2r+c2)K

—

ct))

3)

Thus EV(K) can be written a;:

V(K)

t;9(9,t8tdt

(4)

where f($,t) is the density function for 8 at time t, p is the risk—adjusted

discount rate, and ir(K;9) is given by eqn. (3).

It is difficult, however,

—7—
to evaluate (4) directly. In addition, the rate ji might not be known.

Instead we obtain AV(K) by solving the following equivalent problem:
What is the value of a factory that produces 1

unit of output per period,

with operating cost (2+c2)K + c1, where the output is sold in a perfectly
competitive market at a price Ot,

and where the factory can be shut down

(temporarily and costlessly) if the price 9t

falls

below the operating

cost?e It is shown in the Appendix that the solution to this problem is:

A numerical example is useful to illustrate the characteristics of

there is always some chance that it will be utilized over any finite period

0, the first marginal unit will always be utilized.

The fact that AVIK) is larger when a > 0 might suggest that the firm
should hold a larger amount of capacity, but just the opposite is true.

As

shown below, the firms opportunity cost of exercising its option to invest
in the marginal unit also becomes larger, and by an even greater amount.
The Decision to Invest in the Marginal Unit.

Having valued the marginal unit of capacity, we now value the firm's
option to invest in this unit, and the optimal decision rule for exercising

the option. This is analogous to a perpetual call option with exercise
price k, on a stock that pays a proportional dividend at rate 8 and has a
current price AV(K). In the Appendix it is shown that its value, AF(K), is:

AF(K) =

P, P2, and b2 are given under eqn. (5) above, and e*(K) is the critical
value of 8 at or above which it is optimal to purchase the marginal unit of

capacity, i.e. the firm should purchase the unit if 8 > 8*(K). This
critical value $*(K) is in turn the solution to

Eqn. (7) can be solved numerically for 8, and eqn. (6) can then be used to

Recall our assumption that & > 0.

$*(K) 4 .

Unless

The reader can verify that as & -,

0,

8 > 0, the opportunity cost of investing in a unit of

capacity always exceeds the benefit, and the firm will never install
capacity.1t Thus if firms in an industry are investing optimally and some
positive amount of investment is taking place, we should observe 8 > 0.

As with a call option on a dividend—paying stock, both F(K) and the
critical value $0(K) increase as
function of $ for K =

1 and

increases. Figure 3 shows F(K) as a

= 0, .2, and .4.

When u

0, $ = 1.5,

i.e. the firm should increase capacity only if 8 exceeds 1.5. For

.2

and .4, $* is 2.45 and 3.44 respectively. The opportunity cost of exercis-

ing the firms option to invest in additional capacity is tF(K) , which
increases with u, so a higher o implies a higher critical value e*(K).
Also, it is easily shown that 8(K) is monotonically increasing in K.

The Firms Optimal Capacity.

The function 8*(K) is the firms optimal investment rule; if $ and K
are such that 8 > 0(K), the firm should add capacity, increasing K until 8*

rises to 8.

Equivalently we can substitute for b2(K) and rewrite eqn. (7)

in terms of K*e), the firms optimal capacity:

if the opportunity cost of exercising

1.5 units when o = 0.

as opposed to

But at these capacity levels the opportunity co3t of

investing in a marginal unit exceeds the net value of the unit, so the
value of the firm is not maximized. The optimal capacity is only K' =
the largest K for which F(K) =

V(K)

—

k,

.67,

and the solution to eqn. (7).

3. The Value of The Firm.

As noted above, K'($) is the capacity level which maximizes the firm's

— 11 —

market value, net of cash outlays for the purchase of capital. This can be
seen algebraically and from Figure 5 by noting that the value of the firm
has two components, the value of installed capacity, and the value of the

firm's options to install more capacity in the future.

The firm's net

value as a function of its capacity K is thus given by:

The value of the firm's installed capacity, V(K), is just the first
integral in eqn. (8).
from K

In Figure 5 it is the area under the curve V(K) — k

0 to K*, plus the purchase cost kK. The value of the firm's

options to expand is the second integral, which in Figure 5 is the area
under the curve F(K) from K =

K

to .

As the figure suggests, the value

of the firm's growth options is a large portion of its total value.

The sensitivity of firm value and its components to uncertainty over

future demand can be seen from Table 1, which shows K, V(K), F(K), and
total value for different values of u and e. When

=

0, the value of the

firm is only the value of its installed capacity. Whatever the value of

8, the firm is worth more the the more volatile is demand.

A larger

implies a larger value for each unit of installed capacity, and a much
larger value for the firm's options to expand. Also, the larger is a, the

larger is the fraction of firm value attributable to its growth options.

When a = .2 or more, more than half of the firm's value is F(K), the value
of its growth options. Even when a =

.1,

of total value when 0 is 1 or less.

(When demand is currently small, it is

F(K) accounts for more than half

— 12 —

the possibility of greater demand in the future that gives the firm much of
its value.)

And there is always a range of 8 for which K is zero, so that

all of the firm's value is due to its growth options.
As mentioned earlier,

=

.2 or more should be typical for many

industries. A testable implication of the model is that for firms in such

industries, the fraction of market value attributable to the value of
capital in place should not be much more than one half.

A second implica-

tion is that this fraction should be smaller the greater is the volatility
of market demand.

I

have not tried to test either of these implications

(valuing capital in place is itself a difficult task). However, calcula-

tions reported by Kester (1984) are consistent with both of them, He
estimated the value of capital in place for 15 firms in 5 industries by
capitalizing a

flow of anticipated earnings from this capital, and found

it is half or less of market value in the majority of cases. Furthermore,
this fraction is only about 1/5 to 1/3 in industries where demand is more
volatile (electronics, computers), but more than 1/2 in industries with less
volatile demand (tires and rubber, food processing).

4. The Dynamics of Capacity Capacity Utilization, and Firm Value.

If the firm begins with no capacity, it initially observes 8 and
installs a starting capacity K($).

If

8 then increases, it will expand

capacity accordingly, and the value of the firm will rise. The value of its

growth options will also rise, but will become a smaller fraction of total
value (see Table 1).

However if

8 decreases, it will find itself holding

more capacity than it would have chosen had the decrease been anticipated.
The firm's value will fall, and depending on how much 8 decreases, some of

— 13

its

—

capacity may become unutilized.

Because capital does not depreciate in this model, the firm's capacity

is non—decreasing, but will rise only periodically.

The dynamics of

capacity are characterized in Figure 6, which shows a sample path for 8(t),

and the corresponding behavior of K(t).

(The duration of continuous upward

movements in K(t) is exaggerated.) The firm begins at t0 by installing
K. Then 8 increases until it reaches a (temporary) maximum 8 at

t1, and K is increased accordingly to K. Here it remains fixed until t,
when $ again reaches $.

fterwards

K is increased as $ increases, until t3

when 8 begins to decline from a new maximum, and K remains fixed at K.

Thus an implication of the model is that investment occurs only in
spurts, when demand is rising, and only when it is rising above historic
levels.t2 Firms usually increase capacity only periodically, and this is
often attributed to the 'lumpiness' of investment. But lumpiness is clearly
not required for this behavior.

Let us now examine the firm's capacity utilization.
periods of

expansion,

all capacity will be utilized.

Clearly during

When demand falls,

however, some capacity may go unutilized, but only if it falls far enough.
If the firm had unlimited capacity it would maximize current profits by

setting output at Q = (O—cj)/(21+c2).

However K(8) < (8—c1)/(21+c2), and

as shown in Section 2, can be much less even for moderate values of .

for 8 in the range 8(K)

(2+c2)K +

Thus

< 9 < 9((), capacity will remain

fixed but will be fully utilized. Capacity will go unutilized only when 8 <
9(K). In Figure 6 this occurs durinq the intervals (t., tb) and (t6, ta).

The irreversibility of investment induces firms to hold less capacity

as a buffer against unanticipated drops in demand. s a result there will

— 14 —

be periods of low demands when capacity is fully utilized. 4 large drop in
demand is required for capacity utilization to fall below 1007..

The share of the firms value due to its growth options will also fluctuate
with $.

For example as Table

K(O))

this share falls.

It also falls when $ is

falling and K > K*($). Thus as firms in this model evolve over time, growth
options tend to account for a smaller share of value.

5. The Measurement of Long—Run Marginal Cost.

The measurement of long—run marginal cost and its relationship to price

can be important for industry analyses in general, and antitrust applica-

tions in particular.

As shown below, when investment is irreversible,

traditional measures will understate marginal cost and overstate the amount

by which it differs from price, even in a competitive market. This problem
is particularly severe when product markets are volatile.
Suppose o = 0.
AV(K) = 0/8

Then F(K) =
—

[(2+c2)K

0, and the firm sets K (and 0) so that:
+

c1)/r

= k

(10)

Note that V(K), the value of a marginal unit of capacity, is net of
(capitalized) niarginal operating cost. Let us rewrite (10) as follo's:

The left—hand side of

(10') is ca;italized marginal revenue (8 is capital-

8 =

—

The rAght—hand side is full marginal cost, the capitalized operating cost,

plu. the purchase cost of a unit of capital.

Eqn. (10')

is the usual

relation between marginal revenue and marginal cost when the former is
increasing at a deterministic rate.

Now suppose u > 0, and K =

Observe that two adjustments must be made to obtain full (capitalized)
marginal cost, the RHS of (11'). The first term on the RHS of (11')

is the

value of the firm's option to let the marginal unit of capacity go unutil—
ized, and must be subtracted from capitilized operating cost. The last term
is the opportunity cost of exercising the option to invest. As we have seen

in Section 2, the last term dominates the first, so that K must be smaller
to satisfy (11'), and marginal cost as conventionally measured will understate true marginal cost.

If the firm is a price—taker, I =

0

and P = 8.

Price will equal

marginal cost, if the latter is defined correctly as in (11'). Unfortunate-

But if one wishes to compare price with

marginal cost, ignoring them can be misleading.'3

6. Marginal g and Investment.

The q theory of investment says that firms have an incentive to invest

—1
whenever

marginal q ——

the

—

increase in market value resulting from a

marginal unit of capital divided by the cost of that unit ——

exceeds one.

But models based on this theory have not been very successful in explaining

investment.14 There may be several reasons for this but one possibility is

that in such models the cost of a marginal unit of capital typically
includes only the purchase and installation cost. As we have seen, this can
grossly understate the true cost of the unit.

In empirical applications (e.g. Abel and Blanchard), the change in
market value from a marginal unit of capital is measured as the NPV of the
expected profit flow from the unit, i.e. the present value of the unit. In
our notation, q =

clearly q

>

1

LV(K)/k.

But this ignores the opportunity cost F(K);

does not imply that K should be increased. The correct

measure for q is found by noting that the addition of a marginal unit of

capital increases the value of the firms capital in place by V(K), but
decreases the value of the firms growth options by LFUO.
in market value is thus V(K) —
[AV(K) —

Setting q*

F(K),

The net change

so the correct measure for q is:

LiF(K)]/k

(11)

1 yields the optimal K0.

It is easy to see why marginal q as it is usually measured may fail to

explain investment. Note that an increase in demand (i.e. in 8) will
increase V(K), but it will also increase F(K), although by a smaller
amount. And if u increases, both AF(K) and V(K) rise, but V(K) by less,
so that the desired capital stock falls. But the market value of the firm
increases, so that even if market value data is used to measure q, we will
see an increase in q but a decrease in investment.

As mentioned earlier, F(K) is unfortunately difficult to measure. But

— 17

in

—

some cases it may be possible to construct a proxy for F(K) based on the

sample variance of demand fluctuations.

The use of such a proxy miqht

improve the explanatory power of q theory models.

7. Conclusions.

The model presented here is a simple one that ignores complications
such as adjustment costs, delivery lags, and lumpiness of capital expenditures.

It can easily be extended to account for these factors, but

numerical methods may then be required to obtain solutions. Of course once
numerical methods are used, other aspects of the model can also be general-

ized. For example, demand can be a nonlinear Function of

I?,

or

e

could

follow some alternative stochastic process, perhaps including Jumps.
By treating capital in place as homogeneous, we have been able to focus

on the marginal investment decision, and clarify the ways in which irrever-

sibility of investment and uncertainty over future demand affect both the
value and cost of a marginal unit of capacity. Besides yielding a relative—

1y simple solution to the problem of capacity choice, the model provides a

straightforward method for calculating the firm's market value and its
components.

It also provides insight into the measurement of long—run

marginal cost, and Tobin's q.

In many markets output prices fluctuate with annual standard deviations

in excess of 20 percent. Our results show that in such markets, firms
should hold much less capacity than would be the case if investment were
reversible or future demand were known with certainty.

Also, much of the

market value of these firms is due to the possibility (as opposed to the
expectation) of stronger demands in the future. This value may result from

— 18 -

patents

and technical knowledge, but it also arises from the managerial

expertise and infrastructure, and market position that gives these firms (as
opposed to potential entrants) the option to economically expand capacity.
One might ask whether firms correctly compute and take into account the

opportunity cost of investing when making capacity expansion decisions.
Ignoring such costs would lead to overinvestaent. McConnell and Muscarella

(1986) have found that for manufacturing firms, market value tends to
increase (decrease) when managers announce an increase (decrease) in planned
investment expenditures, which is inconsistent with a systematic tendency to
overinvest.15

But there is anecdotal evidence that managers often base

investment decisions on present values computed with discount rates that far

exceed those that would be implied by the CPPM ——

diversifiable

and non—

diversifiable risk are sometimes confused, and an arbitrary 'risk factor' is

often added to the discount rate.

It may be, then, that managers use the

wrong method to get close to the right answer.

Here we derive eqn. (5) for AV(K;8) and eqns. (6) and

(7)

for the

optimal investment rule and value of the investment option F(K;8).
The value of a marginal unit of capacity, iV(k(;$), is found by valuing

an equivalent "incremental project" that produces 1

unit of output per

period at cost (2+c2) + c1, which is sold at price e(t) , and where the firm

can (temporarily and costlessly) shut down if price falls below cost. To
value this, create a portfolio that is long the project and short AV. units

FOOTNOTES
1.

Other examples of this literature include the papers by Bernanke
(1983), Cukierman (1980), Baldwin (1982), and Paddock, Siegel, and
Smith (1984).
In the papers by Bernanke and Cukierman, uncertainty
over future market conditions is reduced as time passes, so firms have
an incentive to delay investing when markets are volatile (e.g. during

recessions). In the other papers cited above and in the model I
present here, future market conditions are always uncertain. But
because access to the investment opportunity is analogous to holding a

call option on a dividend—paying stock, for any positive amount of
risk, an expenditure should be made only when the value of the result-

ing project exceeds its cost by a positive amount, and increased
uncertainty will increase the incentive to delay the investment
Thus the results are similar to those in Bernanke
expenditure.
and Cukierrnan, but for different reasons.
2.

In Abel (1983) and Hartinan (1972) uncertainty over future prices leads
to an increase in the firm's optimal capital stock when the production
function is linear homogeneous and there are convex adjustment costs.
The reason is that the marginal revenue product of capital is a convex
function of price, so that as in our model, a marginal unit of capital
is worth more when price is stochastic. However in Abel and Hartean,
investment is reversible, so that no options are closed when the firm
invests, and the opportunity cost of investing is zero.

3.

A complete model of industry evolution would also describe the competitive processes through which firms obtain these options.
Such a model
is beyond the scope of this paper.

4.

Analytic solutions for this model can be obtained for any demand
function linear in 8, i.e. P

is straightforward to also allow for uncertainty over future

operating cost. The qualitative results would be the same.
6.

Relaxing these assumptions makes no qualitative difference in the
results.
In fact, allowing for lead times in the construction and
installation of new capacity will magnify the effects of uncertainty.
For a related model that looks specifically at the effects of lead
times, see MaJd and Pindyck (1985).

7.

Still another way to see this is to note that the NPV of investing in a
marginal unit of.capital might be positive because of possible future
states of nature that are profitable. But that NPV might be made even
larger by investing at a later date (and discounting the cost).

B.

The valuation of a factory that can be temporarily shut down has been
studied by Brennan and Schwartz (1985) and McDonald and Siegel (1985).
Observe from eqn. (3) that the present value of an incremental profit
at future time t is the value of a European call option, with expiration date t and exercise price (2'+c2)K + c1, on a stock whose price is

— 23 —

8, paying a proportional dividend .

This point was made by McDonald
and Siegel (1985). Thus AV(K), the value of our "equivalent factory,"
can be found by summing the values of these call options for every
future t.
However this does not readily yield a closed form solution,
and I use an approach similar to that of Brennan and Schwartz (1985).
9.

With r and 8 equal, c = 0 if stochastic changes in 8 are completely
diversifiab]e (i.e.
0 so p
r), but
> 0 otherwise. Also, as

can be seen from eqn. (5), U=0, c2=1) and U=.5, c20) give the
same marginal value of capital, and the same optimal behavior of the
firm. In the first case the firm is a price—taker but earns infra—
marginal rent, and in the second case it has monopoly power.
10.

The standard deviations of annual changes in the prices of such
commodities as oil, natural gas, copper, and aluminum are in the range
of 20 to 50 percent. For manufactured goods these numbers are somewhat
lower, but often 20 percent or higher. Thus a value of u of .2 could
be considered "typical" for simulation purposes.

0, V(K) has an expected rate of growth equal to the risk—
adjusted market rate. Since the firm's option to invest is perpetual,
there would be no gain from installing capacity now rather than later.

If we allow for depreciation, investment will occur more frequently and
even when demand is somewhat below historic highs, but it will still

occur in spurts.
13.

Hall (1986) reports that price significantly exceeds marginal cost for
most two—digit industries, and finds no explanation for this disparity
consistent with competition. Hall's test of marginal cost pricing is
based on the relation between the marginal product of labor and the
product wage.
If firms set marginal operating cost equal to a
(constant) proportion of price, his technique will apply, whatever the
capital stock. But as shown in Section 4, there can be a wide range of
prices for which the firm is capacity constrained, and the ratio of
marginal operating cost to price will vary with price.

14. For example, the model developed by Abel and Blanchard (1986) is one of
the most sophisticated attempts to explain investment in a q theory
framework; it uses a carefully constructed measure for marginal rather
than average q, incorporates delivery lags and costs of adjustment, and

explicitly measures expectations of future values of explanatory
variables.
But Abel and Blanchard conclude that "our data are not
sympathetic to the basic restrictions imposed by the q theory, even
extended to allow for simple delivery lags." Also, see Summers (1981).

15. But they find the opposite true for firms in the oil industry, where
there may be a tendency to overinvest in exploration and development.
