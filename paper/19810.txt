ABSTRACT
The theoretical result that there are welfare gains from trade is a central tenet of international economics.
In a class of trade models that satisfy a "gravity equation," the welfare gains from trade can be computed
using only the open economy domestic trade share and the elasticity of trade with respect to variable
trade costs. The measured welfare gains from trade from this quantitative approach are typically relatively
modest. In this paper, we suggest a channel for welfare gains that this quantitative approach typically
abstracts from: trade-induced changes in domestic productivity. Using a model of sequential production,
in which trade induces a reorganization of production that raises domestic productivity, we show that
the welfare gains from trade can become arbitrarily large.

Introduction

The theoretical result that there are gains from trade is a central tenet of international economics.
Assuming perfect competition and no market failures, trade acts like a technological improvement that
expands the set of feasible allocations and enables Pareto superior outcomes to be achieved. A recent
body of research has sought to quantify the magnitude of these welfare gains. In a class of standard
trade models that satisfy a constant elasticity “gravity equation,” the welfare gains from trade can be
computed using only aggregate data: The open economy domestic trade share and the elasticity of
trade with respect to variable trade costs (see Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare 2012). One of
the main …ndings from this literature is that the welfare gains from trade are relatively modest. For
example, in a study of 19 OECD countries, Eaton and Kortum (2002) …nd that the welfare cost of
moving to autarky ranges from 0.2-10.3 percent.
Many extensions to this quantitative approach have been considered, including the introduction of
input-output linkages (e.g. Caliendo and Parro 2012) and multiple sectors (e.g. Ossa 2012). Some
of these extensions can substantially increase the predicted welfare gains from trade, as surveyed in
Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2013), which reports a range of potential values for the welfare gains
from trade.
In this paper, we suggest a channel for welfare gains that the standard quantitative approach typically
abstracts from: trade-induced changes in domestic productivity. Since domestic productivity directly
a¤ects welfare in both the closed and open economy (separately from trade ‡ows and relative prices)
it provides an additional potential channel for trade to a¤ect welfare. We provide a simple example in
which the contribution of this additional channel to the overall welfare gains from trade can be large.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews a simple version of the
standard quantitative approach and highlights its abstraction from trade-induced changes in domestic
productivity. Section 3 develops a simple extension in which trade leads to endogenous changes in
domestic productivity through a re-organization of production. Section 4 concludes.

Quantifying the Gains from Trade

We consider an Armington model of international trade in which goods are di¤erentiated by country
of origin. The world consists of a number of countries indexed by i; n 2 f1; : : : ; N g. Each country is
endowed with a measure Ln of labor. The utility of the representative consumer in each country n is
derived from the consumption of a non-traded …nal good (Cn ):
Un = Cn :
2

(1)

This non-traded …nal good is produced with traded intermediate inputs according to a constant elasticity
of substitution (CES) production technology:
Yn =

N

( i yni )

i=1

#

;

(2)

where Yn is output of the non-traded …nal good; yni is the quantity of the traded intermediate input
from country i used by country n; and

i

parameterizes the quality or productivity of the traded

intermediate input from country i.
Shipping traded intermediate inputs from country i to country n 6= i incurs iceberg variable trade
costs of dni > 1, where dnn = 1. Cost minimization implies that the share of traded intermediate inputs
from country i in costs in country n is:

and the dual unit cost function for …nal goods production is:

Perfect competition and constant returns to scale imply that the price of the …nal good equals its unit
cost:
Pn = Gn :

(5)

Traded intermediate inputs are produced with labor according to the following constant returns to scale
technology under conditions of perfect competition:
yn = 'n Ln :

(6)

Perfect competition and constant returns to scale imply that the ‘free on board’ intermediate input
price equals unit cost:
pn = wn ='n :

(7)

Using the unit cost function (4) and trade share (3) together with prices, welfare can be expressed in
terms of the domestic trade share and parameters:
Wn = wn =Pn = bn

To assess the rough magnitude of the implied welfare gains from trade, suppose that the domestic trade
share is 80 percent (not unusual for a large country such as the United States) and the trade elasticity
is

1 = 4 (a central value among existing empirical estimates). For these values, the above formula

predicts welfare gains from trade relative to autarky of around 6 percent.
However, a crucial assumption behind this expression is that domestic productivity (here a parameter) is constant (bTn = bA
n ). To the extent that domestic productivity is itself endogenous to trade,
this potential source of welfare gains is not captured. If such trade-induced productivity growth is related to the domestic trade share, the above approach can be amended to incorporate this relationship.
However, in this case, the functional form relating productivity to the domestic trade share becomes
important for evaluating the welfare gains from trade. In the following section, we develop one set of
microfoundations for trade-induced domestic productivity growth. But the idea is much more general.
It applies to any mechanism through which trade a¤ects domestic productivity: technology adoption,
research and development, knowledge spillovers, infrastructure, institutions, and so on.

Sequential Production

The model remains exactly the same as in the previous section except that the non-traded …nal good
is produced using a sequence of traded intermediate inputs indexed by their stage of production s =
1; : : : ; S: The …nal good is the output from stage of production S and is produced using the intermediate
input from stage S

1. The intermediate input from stage S

1 is produced using the intermediate

input from stage S

2, and so on. The intermediate input from stage 1 is produced using a primary

input that is manufactured from labor. Each stage of production must be completed for the …nal good
to be produced.1 The production technology for stage s takes the same form as in (2), where traded
intermediate inputs for each stage of production are di¤erentiated by country of origin:
Yns

1 The vertical disintegration of stages of production across national borders can a¤ect the growth of world trade and
empirical estimates of the border e¤ect (see Yi 2003, 2010). Sequential production also can be consequential for the
organization of stages of production within and beyond the boundaries of the …rm (see Antràs and Chor (2013) and across
countries (see Costinot, Vogel and Wang 2013).

stage s; the dual unit cost function takes the same form as in (4). We allow iceberg trade costs to di¤er
across stages of production: dsni > 1 for n 6= i and dsnn = 1. The share of country n’s costs for stage of

(12)

where dsnn = 1. Perfect competition and constant returns to scale imply that the price of each stage of
production equals its unit cost:
Pns = Gsn :

(13)

Using this result and the expression for the unit cost function (12), we can solve recursively for the
price of each stage of production as a function of the price of the previous stage of production:
Pns =

Proposition 1 The domestic trade shares {

and the trade elasticities {

production s 2 f1; : : : ; Sg are su¢ cient statistics for the welfare gains from trade.
Proof. The proposition follows from (16).

Proposition 2 The welfare gains from trade (WTn =WA
n ) become arbitrarily large as the number of
production stages becomes arbitrarily large (limS!1 WTn =WA
n = 1) or the domestic trade share in any
one individual stage of production r 2 f1; : : : ; Sg becomes arbitrarily small (lim

r !0
nn

WTn =WA
n = 1).

Proof. The proposition follows from (16).
Trade has a fractal-like property in this model, in which there are gains from trade at each intermediate stage of production. If one falsely assumes a single stage of production, when production is in
fact sequential, these gains from trade at each intermediate stage show up as an endogenous increase
in measured domestic productivity. As the number of production stages converges towards in…nity, the
welfare gains from trade become arbitrarily large. This captures the idea that trade involves myriad
changes in the organization of production throughout the economy and the welfare costs from forgoing
this pervasive specialization can be large.
As the domestic trade share for an individual production stage becomes arbitrarily small, the welfare
gains from trade also become arbitrarily large. This captures the idea that some countries may have
strong comparative advantages in some stages of production and the welfare losses from forgoing this
specialization can be large. This result for sequential production has similarities and di¤erences with
Ossa (2012)’s result in a multi-sector model that the presence of sectors with low trade elasticities can
generate large aggregate welfare gains from trade. In contrast, our result holds even if all production
stages have the same trade elasticity, because each production stage has to be completed for the …nal
good to be produced.
Our analysis of sequential production is also related to models of ‘roundabout’production, in which
intermediate inputs enter a Cobb-Douglas production technology through a single CES aggregate (e.g.
Krugman and Venables 1995 and Eaton and Kortum 2002). In ‘roundabout’production models, measuring the welfare gains from trade simply involves controlling for aggregate information on the share
of intermediate inputs in production. In contrast, in our setting with sequential production, correctly
6

computing the welfare gains from trade requires disaggregated information on domestic trade shares
and trade elasticities for all stages of production.
While for simplicity we develop these ideas in an Armington framework, the same analysis can be
undertaken in for example the Eaton and Kortum (2002) Ricardian model.

Conclusions

Substantial progress has been made in quantifying the welfare gains from trade using a class of theoretical models consistent with the gravity equation. These models are rich enough to speak to …rst-order
features of the data, such as country-size and geography, and yet are parsimonious enough to permit
model-based counterfactuals. They typically generate relatively modest welfare gains from trade. In
this paper, we highlight a channel for trade to a¤ect welfare that has received relatively little attention
in this quantitative literature, namely endogenous changes in domestic productivity. Trade can induce
a reorganization of production that elevates domestic productivity. Incorporating such endogenous
changes in production organization into a model of sequential production, we show that the welfare
gains from trade can become arbitrarily large.
