Lights, Camera,... Income!: Estimating Poverty Using National Accounts, Survey Means,

ABSTRACT
In this paper we try to understand whether national accounts GDP per capita or survey mean income
or consumption better proxy for true income per capita. We propose a data-driven method to assess
the relative quality of GDP per capita versus survey means by comparing the evolution of each series
to the evolution of satellite-recorded nighttime lights. Our main assumption, which is robust to a variety
of specification checks, is that the measurement error in nighttime lights is unrelated to the measurement
errors in either national accounts or survey means. We obtain estimates of weights on national accounts
and survey means in an optimal proxy for true income; these weights are very large for national accounts
and very modest for survey means. We conclusively reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight
on surveys is greater than the optimal weight on national accounts, and we generally fail to reject the
null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is zero. Using the estimated optimal weights, we
compute estimates of true income per capita and $1/day poverty rates for the developing world and
its regions. We get poverty estimates that are substantially lower and fall substantially faster than those
of Chen and Ravallion (2010) or of the survey-based poverty literature more generally.

Introduction
Our understanding of how rapidly poverty is falling in the developing world critically depends on how

we measure the means of country income distributions. Disagreement over whether this variable is best
captured by GDP per capita from the national accounts or by mean consumption from household surveys
forms the crux of the di¤erences between researchers asserting that world poverty has fallen dramatically
and has ceased to be a major presence in the developing world outside of Africa, and researchers suggesting
that it has declined more modestly, and remains a problem to be grappled with. Thus, Bhalla (2002),
Sala-i-Martin (2002, 2004, 2006), Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009) and Sala-i-Martin and Pinkovskiy
(2010) use national accounts data to …nd that world poverty has declined to 13% of the developing world
population by 2000 (Bhalla 2002) or to less than 6% of the developing world population by 2006 (Pinkovskiy
and Sala-i-Martin 2009), and that Africa is on track to halve its 1990 level of poverty within a few years of
2015. On the other hand, Chen and Ravallion (2001, 2004, 2010) …nd that world poverty was 25% in 2005
(down from 52% in 1992), that the number of the poor (though not the fraction) continues to increase, and
that the developing world outside China (in particular, Africa) is not on track to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals. The major di¤erence in methodology between these two sets of studies is estimation
of the means of country income distributions: survey means have a much lower level and a slower growth
rate than do national accounts-based GDP estimates, and this di¤erence dwarfs any di¤erence in poverty
estimates that can be attributed to di¤ering parametric or nonparametric assumptions about the course of
within-country income inequality. Deaton (2005) discusses the sources of this discrepancy, some working to
bias national accounts and others to bias survey means, and Young (2012) argues that national accounts
(and, a fortiriori, survey means) underestimate economic growth in Africa based on consumption data from
the Demographic and Health Surveys, but so far, to our knowledge, there has been no success in reconciling
national accounts and survey means and in showing which source of data is superior.
In this paper, we hope to contribute to the literature by proposing a way to assess whether national
accounts or survey means perform better in capturing di¤erences in income across countries and over time,
creating a new measure of income per capita that is an optimal combination of national accounts and
survey means data, and presenting estimates of world poverty from 1992 to 2010 using this measure. Our
main idea is to exploit a third, independently collected source of data on economic activity around the
world: satellite-recorded nighttime lights (Elvidge et al. 1997). It is intuitive that nighttime lights should
re‡ect economic activity to some degree because light is a critical input in many production processes and
consumption activities (e.g. outdoor lighting, consumption activities at night in private homes or public
places, transportation of goods and people, productive activity in factories and o¢ ce buildings, and evening

2

consumption of mass media). The main advantage of using nighttime lights rather than a di¤erent proxy
for income is that the data generating process for lights allows us to distinguish the components of national
accounts (or survey means) that re‡ect true income rather than measurement error. In general, a positive
correlation between measured income (national accounts or survey means) and nighttime lights could be
due to two factors: that they are both correlated with true income, or that their measurement errors are
strongly correlated with each other. However, the latter possibility is implausible because the generating
process of nighttime lights data is to a very large degree independent of the generating process either of
national accounts or of survey means. For example, measured income is collected by statisticians interacting
with survey respondents, while nighttime lights are recorded impersonally by satellites. Statistical teams use
di¤erent procedures in di¤erent countries, while lights are recorded homogeneously across national borders.
Both national accounts and survey means may su¤er from nonrandom nonresponse and misreporting, whereas
nighttime lights do not require compliance or truthfulness of the surveyed population to record whatever
lights exist. Moreover, nighttime lights may vary because of climatic conditions such as auroral activity,
cloudiness and humidity, or because of cultural attitudes towards lighting, which presumably do not a¤ect
measurement errors in national accounts or survey means. Therefore, the strength of the correlation between
nighttime lights and measured income is directly related to the strength of the correlation between the given
income measurement and the true income it is trying to measure. We can use the ratios of correlations
between nighttime lights and di¤erent income measurements to assess the relative strengths of the correlations
between these income measurements and unobserved true income.
Our goal in this paper is twofold: …rst, test whether national accounts or survey means better re‡ect
variation in true income across countries and over time, and second, create a new proxy for true income that
will allow us to compute poverty rates in developing countries and assess the evolution of world poverty.
We …nd that under our assumptions, the national accounts GDP data re‡ect variation in income per capita
much better than survey means do. If we wish to construct an optimal loglinear combination of national
accounts and survey means as an improved proxy for true income per capita, we …nd that the weight that
we wish to place on survey means is 18% of the weight that we wish to place on national accounts GDP.
This is very di¤erent from prior methods of combining survey means and national accounts, which have used
Bayesian theory and the principle of insu¢ cient reason to assign equal weights to survey means and their
predicted value based on national accounts GDP; hence survey means got more than 100% of the weight
placed on national accounts (Chen and Ravallion, 2010). This conclusion also does not change whether
we look at predicting cross-country di¤erences or growth rates of true income, or when we allow for the
relationships between the measures of income we consider (GDP, survey means and lights) to be a¤ected by
other variables, or to vary across space and over time.
3

We can use this methodology to compute optimal loglinear predictors of true income in terms of
national accounts and survey means and estimate poverty for the world as a whole over time. The precise
magnitude of our poverty estimates depends on assuming a scale for the unobserved true income measure.
Under the plausible assumption that this scale is at its long-run value given the weights that should be
placed on national accounts and survey means, we …nd that poverty in the developing world is very close in
level and in trend to the national accounts-based measurements. Even if we use the scaling assumption that
is most favorable for replicating poverty estimates obtained with survey means (Chen and Ravallion 2001,
2004, 2010) we …nd that poverty is lower and has declined by more than has been found by research using
survey means alone, the di¤erence being statistically signi…cant if we account for the statistical error in our
computation of the optimal weights. This result is also robust to ‡exible speci…cations of the relationships
between the di¤erent measures of income, or to accounting for the potential mismeasurement (and speci…cally,
underestimation) of the growth in inequality, rather than just growth in mean income, in the surveys.
In this paper, we remain agnostic about the precise reasons for which national accounts appear to be
a superior measure of true income than survey means are. However, an explanation that is consistent with the
literature exploring the discrepancies between national accounts and survey means (Bhalla (2002), Deaton
(2005, 2010)) is that national accounts-based measures of GDP better capture income streams arising from
consumption of owner-occupied housing and from public goods provided by the government than household
surveys do. This explanation is particularly consistent with our results because nighttime lights would be
expected to capture these two sources of income particularly well, as housing stock and public goods are
major sources of private and public lighting. It is also unlikely that nighttime lights capture aspects of public
or private consumption that do not …gure substantially in the consumption of the poor, such as national
defense spending, spending on luxury goods, transfer of money abroad and corruption.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the relevant literatures.
Section 3 describes the lights measure that we use. Section 4 describes our mathematical framework for
computing optimal weights and states the assumptions that we make on the data generating processes for
lights, GDP and surveys. Section 5 presents our results for relative weights. Section 6 presents our poverty
estimates for the world and for some of its regions. Section 7 concludes.

Related Literature
Our paper is most directly in the literature on estimating the world distribution of income, which is

divided into two major strands: papers estimating means of income distributions with national accounts

GDP [Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002), Bhalla (2002), Sala-i-Martin (2002, 2004, 2006), Pinkovskiy and
Sala-i-Martin (2009), Sala-i-Martin and Pinkovskiy (2010), Pinkovskiy (2013)], and papers estimating means
of income distributions with income or consumption survey means [Chen and Ravallion (2001, 2004, 2010),
Milanovic (2005)]. All papers use data from household surveys to estimate within-country inequality in
the distribution of income or consumption, which is also the procedure we will follow here. It is apparent
(Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin 2009, Dhongde and Minoiu 2010) that the most important factor explaining
the di¤erences between various world poverty estimates is whether national accounts GDP or survey means
are used to anchor country income distributions, rather than the way in which the shape of these distributions
is extracted from limited inequality data. Alvaredo and Gasparini (2013) provide a general review of this
literature.
We are not the …rst to combine national accounts GDP and survey means in an attempt to obtain a
better measure of true income. Deaton (2001) notes that if we have two faulty measures of the same thing, it
is reasonable to try to use a weighted average of them to reduce their ‡aws. Chen and Ravallion (2010) draw
on Karshenas (2003) to present a mixed method in which log survey means are averaged with their predicted
value based on national accounts consumption. However, using a simple average of these two measures is
arbitrary when it is possible to exploit auxiliary information to create an optimal, data-driven combination
of national accounts and survey means, which is our contribution in this paper.
Many arguments have been made about the virtues and defects of national accounts and survey
means. On the one hand, it is obvious that surveys su¤er from nonresponse bias, which may have been
growing over time (Bhalla (2002)). It is also the case that surveys may measure certain categories of spending,
which may have been growing in importance as a share of consumption, incorrectly, such as spending on
new goods (Bhalla 2002) or spending on public goods. On the other hand, it is plausible that household
surveys, which are typically carried out by the World Bank itself, may be better implemented than the
national accounts collection in developing countries. National accounts estimates are often constructed under
assumptions that are implausible for many markets in developing countries (e.g. perfect competition), which
may lead to overstating income through the inclusion of rents as value added (Deaton 2005). Moreover, survey
nonresponse is unlikely to be independent of respondent income, with rich people in developing countries
probably unlikely to respond to surveys, or to reveal their incomes. For example, Korinek et al. (2005)
…nds that rich people in America are nearly 50% less likely to respond to surveys as poor people are (but
Bhalla (2002) …nds that consumption of luxuries is not substantially more underreported in India’s 19931994 National Statistical Survey than is consumption of necessities). While it is not theoretically necessary
that increasing nonresponse with income should decrease measured inequality (Deaton (2005) exhibits an
admittedly special model in which nonresponse by the rich leaves inequality unchanged and decreases the
5

survey mean only), there is the possibility that nonrandom nonresponse, growing over time, may mask rising
inequality in developing countries.1
We believe that our analysis can avoid many of the pitfalls of either national accounts or survey means.
Given that light is such an essential input to most meaningful economic activities, it is unlikely that our lights
measure can be critiqued for attributing spurious or deleterious activites, such as monopoly rent extraction,
to economic growth. Nor is it plausible to believe that the part of income that varies with light intensity is
particularly unequally distributed, since light intensity derives from agglomeration of multiple lit structures,
which are unlikely to be very closely owned. We think that nighttime lights most likely re‡ect lighting in
houses, production facilities (stores, factories, ports) and modes of transportation. Since nighttime lights
data is collected through an impersonal, nonintrusive process, concerns about nonresponse do not apply.
While we cannot rule out theoretically that surveys underestimate inequality as well as economic growth, in
our analysis, we can perform robustness checks by assuming counterfactual paths for the growth rate of the
Gini coe¢ cient over time; we …nd only modest e¤ects on poverty estimates for very large mismeasurements
of the Gini coe¢ cients.
More recently, several papers have challenged the quality of national accounts, especially for the
estimation of growth rates. Johnson et al. (2009) …nd large discrepancies between di¤erent vintages of the
Penn World Tables, and show that successive updates of the PWT may yield di¤erent answers to questions
on year-to-year variation in country growth rates. Young (2012) …nds that changes in consumption of
common goods recorded in the Demographic and Health Surveys in a variety of developing countries imply
much higher growth rates in income than are recorded in the national accounts. Our paper also tries to
assess the quality of and improve national accounts data by using external information (as in Young [2012]).
We sidestep the di¢ culties of using the PWT by using PPP-adjusted GDP per capita from the World
Development Indicators, but our focus is ultimately on comparing national accounts and survey means to
each other rather than on assessing both of them against a third measure.
There is a large and growing literature that uses satellite data on lights at night as a proxy for income. Elvidge et al. (1997, 1999, 2007, 2010, 2012) describe the nighttime lights data, show that nighttime
lights correlate well with electricity utilization and GDP, and construct poverty and inequality measures
based on nighttime lights. Henderson, Storeygard and Weil (2009, 2012) (the latter, hereafter, HSW (2012))
and Chen and Nordhaus (2010) (hereafter CN (2010)) argue that nighttime lights are systematically correlated with rates of economic growth and may improve measures of GDP for poor countries. Michalopoulos
1 Survey estimates of disposable income from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) (LIS 2013) …nd mean incomes to be
larger and Gini coe¢ cients to be smaller for the several developing countries and years for which both LIS estimates and survey
estimates used in Chen and Ravallion (2010) are available. For example, the LIS survey for Brazil …nds that mean disposable
income is $6000 and the Gini is 48; the Brazilian survey cited by Chen and Ravallion (2010) …nds that mean income is $3900
and the Gini is 56. Comparisons for Colombia, Estonia, Guatemala, Hungary, Mexico, Peru and Poland are similar.

and Papaioannou (2012, 2013), Alesina, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013) and Pinkovskiy (2013) use
nighttime lights to construct measures of income within African ethnicities, world ethnicities and neighborhoods of national borders respectively. Our paper is closest in spirit to HSW (2012) and CN (2010) in that it
also considers the problem of optimally combining measures of economic activity; however, instead of using
nighttime lights as a component of such a measure, we use it as an auxiliary variable to help uncover the
correlation structure between the measures we do wish to use in our index. We also consider a di¤erent
type of predictor for true income that do either HSW (2012) or CN (2010), which allows us to make fewer
assumptions on the data generating processes that we consider.

The Nighttime Lights Measure
Data on luminosity at night is collected by the DMSP-OLS satellite program and is maintained and

processed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Satellites orbit the Earth
every day between 20:30 and 22:00, sending images of every location between 65 degrees south latitude and
65 degrees north latitude at a resolution of 30 arcseconds (approximately 1 square km at the equator). The
images are processed to remove cloud cover, snow and ephemeral lights (such as forest …res) to produce the
…nal product available for download at

http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html

The nighttime lights data is available from 1992 to 2012, and we use the data up to 2010 because of
the paucity of household surveys after that date that have already been made available for research.
Each pixel (1 square kilometer) in the luminosity data is assigned a digital number (DN) representing
its luminosity. The DNs are integers ranging from 0 to 63, with the relationship between DN and luminosity
being

Radiance / DN3=2
(Chen and Nordhaus 2010). However, pixels with DN equal to 0 or 63 may be top- or bottom-censored.
Another known problem with the lights data is the presence of overglow and blooming: light tends to travel
to pixels outside of those in which it originates, and light tends to be magni…ed over certain terrain types
such as water and snow cover (Doll 2008). Given that we will compute national-level estimates of aggregate
lights, it is unlikely that these sources of error will be large enough or su¢ ciently correlated with important

7

variables that they will confound our analysis. Another problem may be that satellites age in space and are
eventually retired. Hence, they might give inconsistent readings from year to year, or new satellites may
give fundamentally di¤erent readings from old ones.2 While some evdence of this problem exists, we will
show in Sections 5 and 6 that our estimates of the optimal ways of combining national accounts and survey
means are almost invariant to allowing the relationship between national accounts, survey means and lights
to di¤er from year to year.
In our analysis, we will use the nighttime lights to construct an aggregate radiance measure for each
country in each year and use it as a proxy for aggregate income. We construct this measure by computing the
radiance within each pixel in each country and adding up the pixels. Using alternative aggregation formulas
(for instance, adding up the DN’s across pixels) yields very similar results. For years with multiple satellites
available, we average the logarithms of our aggregate luminosity measure, following HSW (2012).
It is well established that lights are very well correlated with national accounts GDP, in levels, growth
rates and business cycle ‡uctuations. Henderson, Storeygard and Weil (2012) provide these correlations, as
well as dramatic pictures of long-term di¤erences in incomes (North vs. South Korea) as well as short-term
‡uctuations (the Asian …nancial crisis of 1997-8) re‡ected in lights. We provide two pictures emphasizing
two poor countries for which national accounts and survey means give completely di¤erent growth estimates:
Angola and India. Figure I presents a picture of nighttime lights over southern Africa in 2000 and in 2009. We
see that Angola, which according to the household surveys has experienced a 5% decline in per capita income,
and according to the national accounts has experienced a doubling of per capita income (for all statistics, see
Appendix Table AII), has many more lights in 2009 than it did in 2000. Most other southern African countries
also have more lights in 2009 than in 2000 (Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa, Malawi), but
Zimbabwe has fewer lights, because of its economic collapse under the disastrous hyperin‡ationary policies of
Robert Mugabe. Figure II gives a view of India between 1994 and 2010. According to household surveys, its
per capita income grew by 29% over this time period, but according to the national accounts its per capita
income more than doubled. We see that lights in India increase dramatically both in their intensity over
the major cities as well as in their extent over previously unlit areas of the country (for example, there is a
marked increase over Bihar in the Ganges valley, one of India’s poorest provinces). The increase in lights in
India and in Angola is much closer to what is suggested by the national accounts than by the survey means,
and it is very unlikely that this additional economic activity bene…ts exclusively the rich because of the
spatial extent of the new lights. Moreover, the fact that we observe Angola growing and Zimbabwe shrinking
over the same period of time and measured with the same satellites suggests that uniform di¤erences in
2 The satellites from which data is available are: F10 (1992-1994), F12 (1994-1999), F14 (1997-2003), F15 (2000-2007), F16
(2004-2009) and F18 (2010-).

brightness between satellites do not dominate the observed variation in lights. While these …gures are only
suggestive (the lights we observe are aggregate rather than per capita lights), they already provide a hint
that economic growth in the developing world may have been more extensive than surveys show.

Mathematical Framework
Calculation of Relative Weights in Optimal Forecasts
Consider the following model of our data. We have N + 1 candidate proxies yin , n = 0; :::; N for log true

income, denoted yi . We also have a vector of covariates xi of length K (which always includes a constant
but may also include other variables). De…ne the loglinear forecast of yi as

zi = (Xi ) +
where yi is a vector of the yin ’s, Xi is an N

0

yi

K matrix of the xi ’s,

is a linear function, and

is a

vector of weights.
To …x notation, we set the log lights-based GDP measure to be yi0 , log World Bank GDP per capita
to be yi1 , log survey means to be yi2 and other GDP-based measures (if any) are yi3 , yi4 etc.
We are interested in two quantities. First, we wish to assess the weight given to log survey means
(yi2 ) in the optimal forecast relative to the weight given to log World Bank GDP per capita (yi1 ). This is
given by
!
^ := ^ 2 =^ 1
where ^ is the optimal weight vector.
We are also interested in computing values for zi itself for all countries and years in our sample and
in using zi in place of yi1 or yi2 as the logarithm of the true mean of the income distribution for the country
and year corresponding to observation i. Doing this will require more assumptions than calculating !
^ , but
our conclusions will be qualitatively robust to a variety of alternatives for the assumptions we have to add.
To calculate !
^ we make the following assumptions:

yin =

n

(xi ) +

n yi

+ "ni , "ni i.i.d. across i.

E ("ni "m
i jXi ) =
9

nm

(A1)

(A2)

E ("ni yi jXi ) = 0

(A3)

E "ni "0i jXi = 0

(A4)

All of these assumptions have been made (without conditioning on controls) in the previous literature,
notably by Henderson, Storeygard and Weil (2012) and Chen and Nordhaus (2010). The iid assumption is
the substance in Assumption A1. Assumption A2 assumes homoskedasticity with respect to Xi . Assumption
A3 mandates that the error in each proxy is an a¢ ne function of true income plus noise that is uncorrelated
with income, and that the linear relationship is stable across the sample. Assumption A4 is the key reason
for the use of the lights data: it says that the random errors in lights measurement are uncorrelated with
the random errors in GDP or survey-based income measurement. This assumption has also been made in
HSW (2012) and CN (2010). This is a plausible assumption because the data generating processes of the
lights data and of GDP (or surveys) are largely disjoint; lights data is collected by satellites without respect
for borders, institutional structures, or people’s desire to respond to surveys, whereas GDP and survey data
are obtained primarily by asking people, who may be unwilling to respond accurately, if at all. There is
a fear that errors in GDP, surveys and lights have a common component; for instance, if the product of
di¤erent industries is di¤erentially accounted for by surveys (because of di¤erential ease of reporting), and
also generates di¤erent amounts of light per unit of true income, then the errors in both light and GDP
will have a common component (though likely with di¤erent coe¢ cients, or even signs). However, since

n

is not necessarily unity, all our GDP proxies are allowed to have a bias that is a¢ ne in true income, so if
di¤erential industrial composition causes a bias that is related to GDP size (which is not an implausible
assumption, at least to …rst order) this will be re‡ected in the

n ’s

not being equal to unity. Moreover, the

framework accomodates including controls that may help make this assumption more credible.
Suppose that the parameters

For the analysis in this paper, we will not include the nighttime lights variable as a component of
our optimal proxy for true income. We do this because its weight depends on the product

vary in a range that permits the relative weight on nighttime lights to be zero, or to be in…nite.3 Therefore,

Calculation of Optimal Forecasts
To calculate absolute magnitudes of ^ (the unbiased estimation weights) and the optimal proxies zi we

need additional assumptions on

and E (yi jXi ) in order to estimate the

i

(X)’s. Intuitively, the vector

^ incorporates information about cross-country income di¤erences and growth rates, but we need to make
assumptions about the average level of our income proxy series. These assumptions are essentially arbitrary
but can matter substantially for the results.
We make the following assumption for our baseline analyses:

so the estimated weights sum to unity and the intercept function of our proxy zi can be set to zero. HSW

(2012) also consider weights that sum to unity (and that, in fact are also nonzero). The second part of
Assumption A5a is motivated by noting that if yin is indexed by time (so i = (j; t) where j indexes countries
and t indexes years) and we have

n
lim yj;t
=1

t!1

(which is reasonable given that income tends to grow at an exponential rate) then the proxy zj;t will
satisfy

lim

t!1

Hence, setting

zj;t

j;t

(Xi ) = 0 will be a good approximation to the value of the optimal proxy for yi in

the long run. Since we have no reason to believe that the system governing the relative errors of the national
accounts and survey means data is not in a long-run steady state, to which it will eventually tend, we take
this normalization as a baseline assumption for computing the optimal proxies.
Another justi…cation for the assumptions on E (yi jXi ) in Assumption A5a is that they yield very
similar results to scaling the optimal proxy to national accounts consumption. Bhalla (2002) scales the
means of country income distributions to national accounts consumption, arguing that national accounts
consumption is an accurate proxy for the fraction of national accounts GDP that is reasonably shared with
the poor, and Deaton (2005) also suggests that national accounts consumption may be a reasonable proxy for
household disposable income. Most interestingly, the harmonized household disposable income estimates of
the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS 2013) seem to con…rm this view, coming very close, or much closer than
do the surveys used by Chen and Ravallion (2010), to matching national accounts consumption. In fact, LIS
household disposable income estimates for OECD countries are virtually identical to World Bank national
accounts estimates of consumption per capita in these countries (the average of LIS household disposable
income in a dataset of 34 country-years in the OECD on the LIS website is $24,550, and the same average of
their World Bank-recorded consumption is $24,549). The LIS has very little data on developing countries,
but for the 12 country-years in developing countries that they have data for, their estimates of household
disposable income are much higher than PovcalNet estimates of mean income or consumption, and for one
of these country-years (Guatemala 2006), the LIS estimate even exceeds the World Bank national accounts
consumption estimate. A table of these 12 country-years with estimates of mean income or consumption for
PovcalNet household surveys, LIS surveys and NA consumption is given as Appendix Table AIII.
We also consider alternative normalizations in which we assume that either national accounts or
survey means have a unit relationship with true income (again based on HSW (2012) and CN (2010)) and
15

that the scale of true income matches that of the national accounts or of the survey means:

Results for Optimal Weights
Data
We use national accounts data from the World Bank (GDP per capita, PPP, constant 2005 international

dollars). The overwhelming majority of countries do not have missing data for this element. National
accounts data (from the World Bank or from the Penn World Tables) is overwhelmingly used in crosscountry studies of determinants of growth [Barro (1991), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992a and b), Mankiw,
Romer and Weil (1992), Barro (1999), Sala-i-Martin (1996), Sala-i-Martin, Mulligan and Gil (2002), Sala-iMartin, Doppelho¤er and Miller (2005), La Porta et al. (1999), Acemoglu et al. (2001, 2002, 2003, 2008),
Spolaore and Wacziarg (2005), Ashraf and Galor (2013) among others]
We use a dataset on mean survey consumption from household surveys collected by the World Bank
(Povcalnet, http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm) and used by Chen and Ravallion (2001,
2004, 2010). This dataset mainly consists of surveys after 1990, although there are a few surveys present
in the 1980s as well. Many of the survey parameters are heterogeneous (for instance, some surveys are
income surveys and others are consumption surveys) but it appears that the heterogeneity is decreasing over
time and is not particularly important for our results (allowing indicators for survey income concept does
not a¤ect our conclusions). On average, there are about 30-40 surveys each year since 1992, and there are
123 countries surveyed. Survey availability is the primary constraint for our baseline sample from which to
estimate the relative optimal weights of national accounts and survey means in the optimal proxy. Overall,
16

we have 701 surveys in this sample, all of which match to national accounts and the lights data for the period
1992-2010.
We also use the lights proxy detailed in Section 3, which we construct by summing up radiance
for each country pixel by pixel, dividing by country population and taking the logarithm. This measure is
available for all countries after 1992, which precludes using the (relatively few) surveys taken before that
date for the analysis. In principle, since we do not use the nighttime lights measure in our index, we could
use the surveys from before 1992 for our poverty estimation, but we choose to concentrate on the period
1992-2010 to avoid assumptions about the out-of-sample validity of the optimal survey weights.
Our sample contains observations from the developing world only: there are no World Bank surveys
for OECD countries because OECD countries have virtually no population below the $1/day poverty line.
Since this paper focuses on poverty, including the OECD countries should not change our analysis. Moreover,
lights are a worse measure of output (in particular, growth rates) in OECD countries than in developing
countries because the lights measure tends to be topcoded at a light intensity corresponding to the luminosity
of a typical developed world city (Doll 2008). Appendix Table AII presents a list of all countries in the base
sample, the number and date range of their surveys, and their income as measured by GDP, surveys and
lights in the …rst and last year of their membership in the sample.
For some speci…cations we also include controls in the function

(X). We have data on log population

and the log fractions rural and urban for each country in each year. For most countries and years, we also have
data on log consumption share, log capital formation as percent of GDP, log shares of GDP in agriculture,
manufacturing and services, log export share, log import share, and log government expenditure share of
GDP. All these variables are from the World Bank. Appendix Table AI presents summary statistics for all
these variables for the whole world between 1992 and 2010, as well as for the base sample.
It is important to verify explicitly that there indeed exist relationships between nighttime lights,
national accounts GDP and true income. To do so, in Table I we provide estimates of the quantity
2
S1;0
= 1 0
S1;1 S0;0
S1;1 S0;0

which is positive if and only if

0

and

1

are both distinct from zero and have the same sign. If

0

were equal to

zero, lights would be a useless indicator of true income and our approach would fail to estimate the structural
parameters of our model (we would not be able to identify
zero and their quotient would be meaningless). If

1

n= 1

because all covariances would be equal to

were zero or of di¤erent sign from

0,

then national

accounts would be a useless (or misleading) indicator of true income if lights were considered an indicator
of true income and vice versa, making the rationale for using lights to proxy for income questionable. We

17

provide these estimates for a variety of speci…cations for

(Xi ) in rows 1-5: constant

(Xi ) (corresponding

to looking at the power of lights to predict true income over all across-country-year variation), year …xed
e¤ects (looking at how well lights predict cross-country variations in income but not world growth rates),
country …xed e¤ects (looking at how well lights predict within-country growth rates but not the cross-country
income distribution), country and year …xed e¤ects (looking at cross-country deviations in growth rates), and
country and year …xed e¤ects with country time trends (looking at country business cycles). Fortunately,
regardless of the type of variation we consider, as Table I shows, lights have predictive power over true
income. We also provide estimates of the correlation
2
S2;0
= 2 0
S2;2 S0;0
S2;2 S0;0

for comparison, which corresponds to the correlation between nighttime lights and survey means. Survey
means are also strongly correlated with nighttime lights, though not as strongly as are national account estimates, and cross-country deviations in growth rates of survey means are not correlated with such deviations
of nighttime lights (column 4).

5.2

Estimates of Relative Weights
Table II presents estimates of the ratio of the weight of the log survey mean to the weight of the log

national accounts mean in the optimal linear proxy for log true income. This ratio corresponds to

!
^ = ^ 2 =^ 1 = ^ surveys =^ N A

or

!
~ = ~ 2 =~ 1 = ~ surveys =~ N A
in the notation of Section 4. Recall that this ratio is estimable under Assumptions A1-A4 without
any need to assume anything about the magnitude of

1.

The interesting hypothesis to test on the relative weights that we obtain are not only whether these
weights are equal to zero but also how they compare to weights implicitly used in the literature. Research
using exclusively national accounts implicitly assumes that ^ surveys = 0, and hence that !
^ = 0. Research
that exclusively uses survey means implicitly assumes that ^ N A = 0 and hence that !
^ = +1. Chen and
Ravallion (2010) consider a mixed method in which they measure income per capita by the geometric mean
of the survey mean consumption and the …tted value of survey mean consumption from a regression of log
18

consumption on a constant and on log consumption in the national accounts. Chen and Ravallion (2010)
report that the coe¢ cient on log consumption from the national accounts in such a regression tends to be
between 0:6 and 0:85, so we can consider

ziCR =

where

1
1
+ yi2 + yi1
2
2

2 (0:6; 0:85). Hence, the Chen-Ravallion (2010) approach assumes that ^ surveys > ^ N A ,

and hence that !
^ > 1.
Each column of Table II presents estimates of optimal relative weights from a di¤erent speci…cation
of our model. We consider estimates with and without control variables, and we also consider treating
each survey as an observation (so countries with more surveys get more weight) or treating each country
as an observation (thus countries are equally weighted and surveys in countries with many surveys are
underweighted relative to ones in countries with few surveys). Both approaches can be rationalized: surveys
within each country di¤er in methodology, but surveys within a country tend to be more similar than surveys
across countries (at least because they are processed by the same statistical o¢ ces). In lieu of standard errors
we present upper and lower 95% con…dence interval bounds for each weight ratio obtained by the bootstrap,
which are more conservative than the asymptotic approximation. We also present (as P (j^
! j > 1)) the
fraction of bootstrap iterations in which the weight ratio !
^ is estimated to be greater than unity in absolute
value, which is evidence towards the null hypotheses !
^ > 1 and !
^ = +1. We present this statistic because
the distribution of !
^ is nonstandard, and under the null hypothesis !
^ = +1 would be bimodal: it would
contain no mass in the interval j^
! j > 1 but a lot of mass outside that interval. The raw con…dence interval
would then be a misleading indicator of the domain of !
^ because this domain would no longer be an interval
but comprise two disjoint intervals. Hence, the statistic P (j^
! j > 1) provides useful information for the few
speci…cations we have with wide con…dence intervals for !
^ by indicating where the mass of the distribution
of !
^ is located.
Each row of Table II presents estimates of this optimal ratio for forecasting di¤erent types of variation
in true income by including richer and richer …xed e¤ects to account for the remaining variation. Row 1
includes no …xed e¤ects, and thus seeks to …nd an optimal proxy to capture di¤erences in income across and
within countries. Row 2 includes year …xed e¤ects; thus allowing world growth to di¤er ‡exibly between
national accounts and surveys (this speci…cation also allows di¤erences between satellites in di¤erent years).
Row 3 includes country …xed e¤ects, thus considering only the relative quality of national accounts and
survey means in forecasting country growth rates. Row 4 includes both country and year …xed e¤ects, which
focuses on country growth deviations from a world trend. Finally, row 5 includes country and year …xed

19

e¤ects as well as country trends, which looks at the relative quality of national accounts and survey means
in forecasting each country’s ‡uctuations around its growth trend, and comparing these ‡uctuations across
countries. Di¤erent types of analyses may wish to use relative weights from di¤erent columns: for instance,
studies of business cycles in developing countries would be most interested in within-country variation around
a trend, which is presented in row 5. Since we will be interested in estimating levels of mean income and
since we do not wish to impose priors on average levels of income for each country over time, we will be
using the estimates from row 1 in our poverty analysis in Section 6.
Our baseline estimate (Row 1 and Column 1 of Table II) suggests that the relative weight of surveys
in an optimal proxy, !
^ , is 0:182, and that with 95% con…dence, it is between

0:072 and 0:541. Note that

we easily reject the null hypothesis that !
^ = 1, or surveys get the same weight as national accounts (Chen
and Ravallion 2010), and a fortiriori, !
^ = +1. We see that P (j^
! j > 1) < 0:01 (which is intuitive based
on the narrow con…dence interval), so virtually all of the distribution of !
^ is outside the region it would
be predicted to be in if surveys had the same weight as national accounts or greater. We also fail to reject
the null hypothesis that !
^ = 0, or surveys get zero weight in the optimal proxy [Sala-i-Martin (2002, 2004,
2006), Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin 2009, Sala-i-Martin and Pinkovskiy 2010]. In fact, for any speci…cation
in rows 1-4 (using cross-country variation in levels or growth rates) and in any column (with or without
control variables for potential common sources of measurement error in nighttime lights, national accounts
and survey means) we reject the hypothesis !
^ = 1, we fail to reject the hypothesis !
^ = 0, and we …nd that
P (j^
! j > 1) is very low. In row 5, we reject the null hypothesis that !
^ = 0 for two speci…cations, and we fail to
reject the null hypothesis that !
^ = 1 for two other speci…cations. However, the magnitudes of our estimated
relative weights in row 5 are similar to those in rows 1-4 (they are all less than 0:42 in absolute value) and our
changes in inference come from di¤erences in the standard errors. In particular, for the speci…cations with
the full set of controls in row 5, the standard errors explode and the estimator distribution has outliers, which
prevents us from rejecting the null that !
^ = 1. This is not particularly surprising because we almost succeed
in explaining our GDP proxies with the covariate controls as well as with the very rich …xed e¤ects and time
trends, leaving little variation to be explained by business cycle variation in true income. It is important to
verify that the wide con…dence interval comes from large standard errors and not from

N A = surveys

being

close to zero; if that were the case, we would see a lot of bootstrap trials with j^
! j > 1. However, even for
these speci…cations, P (j^
! j > 1) is low (it is about 0:15 and 0:06 respectively), suggesting that most of the
distribution of !
^ is still consistent with the hypothesis that the weight on survey means should be lower in
absolute value than the weight on the national accounts.
Table III presents estimates of the optimal relative weight of log survey means for each of four
large subregions of the developing world (Africa, Latin America, Asia and the post-Communist countries of
20

Europe and the former USSR) as well as for three time subperiods of the sample (1992-1997, 1998-2003 and
2004-2010). for the same speci…cations as in Table II. Each cell also presents the estimates of the implied
weights of national accounts and of survey means under the additional assumption A5a. We see that for all
the subregions and the subperiods, the point estimates of the relative weight of log survey means are less than
unity (in fact, less than 0.5), and frequently negative. We also see that the weights on log national accounts
GDP are large and close to unity and the weights on log survey means are relatively small, except for certain
years. However, we see that there is greater heterogeneity in !
^ than in Table II and that we can no longer
reject most hypotheses of interest based on the bootstrap con…dence intervals for our estimates for America,
Asia, and the period 2004-2010. This pattern may be rationalized by noting that Latin American countries
conduct surveys more frequently than other countries do (and hence, they have had more opportunities to
optimize their survey design), that Latin American countries survey income, rather than consumption, and
that surveys conducted in the later period 2004-2010 may have been of better quality than preceding ones.

Estimates of Global Poverty and True Income Per Capita

6.1

Additional Assumptions on Data for Poverty Estimation
Under assumptions A1-A4 and any one of assumptions A5a-A5c we can calculate the optimal proxies for

log true income zi for each country and year and compute the implied estimates of world poverty. Owing to
the paucity of surveys, the literature interpolates or extrapolates survey mean consumption to avoid having
poverty estimates depend drastically on whether or not countries with many poor people happen to have a
survey in a given year. We perform this imputation by 1) linearly interpolating and extrapolating log survey
means for countries with at least two surveys in the Chen-Ravallion database, 2) using the growth rates
of national accounts GDP for countries with only one survey in the database, and 3) dropping countries
with no surveys in the Chen-Ravallion database.4 We drop 33 countries this way, of which the largest are
South Korea, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Somalia, the UAE, Libya, Eritrea and Lebanon.
Altogether we are left with 123 countries in the developing world, which cover 5.66 billion people in 2010,
or about 96.7% of the developing world population.
Having interpolated and extrapolated survey mean consumption, we can easily compute the optimal
proxies zi for the log means of the country income distributions using this interpolated log survey mean
series, the log World Bank GDP series, and a set of weights and intercept terms (Xi ) from the …rst row and
4 Chen

and Ravallion (2010) perform a very similar procedure, using national accounts growth rates to interpolate and
extrapolate survey means.

21

column of Table II. We can then use these estimates of the income distribution means to recover poverty
by assuming the income distribution is lognormal, recovering the distribution / shape parameters from the
Gini coe¢ cients reported with the surveys (which we also interpolate and extrapolate as we do the survey
mean consumption for countries with two or more surveys and leave constant for countries with one survey),
and integrating up to the poverty line.5 We follow the World Bank and the United Nations Development
Programme and use a poverty line of $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP-adjusted dollars, which is approximately 457
dollars a year. We then bootstrap this procedure for each speci…cation and report the mean, the 5% lower
bound and the 95% upper bound of poverty estimates for the years 1992 and 2005 (the …rst year that lights
data are available and the last year of the Chen-Ravallion sample) as well as for each year between 2006 and
2010. The uncertainty in the poverty estimates comes from the fact that the optimal weights and intercept
terms used to construct them are estimated with error.6

6.2

Estimates of Poverty and True Income per Capita for the Developing World:
Baseline Results and Robustness Checks
Table IV presents the poverty rate estimates for the developing world as a whole. Rows 1 and 2 recall

the results of the previous literature by presenting poverty estimates under the assumptions that either
1

= 0 and

2

= 1 (designed to replicate the survey mean-based estimates of Chen and Ravallion (2010),

hereafter CR (2010)) or, respectively, that

1

= 1 and

2

= 0 (designed to replicate the national account-

based estimates of Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009), hereafter PSiM (2009)). Since the interpolation
and extrapolation methods are di¤erent across papers we cannot replicate the results exactly but we come
extremely close. For example, we replicate CR (2010) poverty to be 42% in 1992 and 25.8% in 2005, while
in the original paper these numbers are 39.6% in 1993 and 25.2% in 2005 (Row 2). PSiM (2009) estimate
poverty to be 8.3% in 1992 and 5.6% in 2005, but these numbers are for the world as a whole rather than
for the developing world only, and they also include the countries without surveys. Since it may be safely
assumed that no one in rich countries (the OECD) is poor, the population of the OECD is approximately
14% of the world population, and the population of countries without surveys is relatively small, the poverty
rates for the developing world implied by PSiM (2009) are 9.5% in 1992 and 6.3% in 2005, while we replicate
these rates here to be 9.4% in 1992 and 5% in 2005. The means of the developing world income distributions
for these years are reported in Table VI; we see that the national account-based means are more than twice
5 We use the lognormal distribution as an example, as we have shown in Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2010) that neither
the interpolation procedures nor the parametric form of the country income distributions matter substantially for estimating
the world distribution of income.
6 Bootstrapping the distribution of our estimator also helps us avoid the problem that we estimate log true income whereas
we are interested in estimating true income. We simply use the mean of the distribution of each estimator as our estimate of
the desired quantity. In practice, typically, the bias arising from nonlinearity tends to be small, and we would get similar results
if we used standard asymptotic analysis.

22

as large as the survey-based means.
The rest of Table IV presents our new estimates of developing world poverty based on optimally
combining national accounts and survey means. Row 3 presents our baseline estimates under the long-run
scaling assumption A5a. We see that our poverty estimate for 1992 is 11.8%, which falls to 6.1% in 2005
and 4.5% in 2010. Our estimated poverty rates are very close to the estimates of PSiM (2009), and we
can reject with 95% con…dence the hypothesis that poverty fell by less than half by 2010. Hence (and not
surprisingly given our evidence on relative weights in Table II) optimally combining national accounts and
survey means through the use of the nighttime lights data as an independent benchmark to uncover the
joint relationship of these measures’errors from true income yields poverty estimates much closer to those
deriving from the national accounts than from the survey means. Table VI presents our baseline estimates
of developing world true income per capita levels; they are much closer to the national account-based means
than to the survey-based means.
Rows 4 and 5 present robustness checks of this result by changing assumption A5a to assumptions
A5b and A5c respectively; hence, by normalizing the optimal proxy to the level of the national accounts or
to that of the household surveys. We see that normalization makes a di¤erence: the level of poverty that
we calculate under assumption A5c (normalizing to surveys) is much higher than the one that we calculate
under assumption A5b (normalizing to national accounts). However, even under assumption A5c, which uses
very nearly the same scale for income as do CR (2010) and uses the weights only to compute growth rates
and cross-sectional di¤erences across countries, we see that poverty is estimated to be a third to a half the
size in all years considered than in CR (2010), and that our survey-normalized estimates indicate both lower
and faster-falling poverty rates than do the estimates of CR (2010) with 95% con…dence. Table VI presents
the corresponding estimates of the developing world true income per capita levels; they vary as the poverty
rate estimates do. Figures III and IV present the time paths of world poverty rates, the …rst in levels and the
second as a percentage of the 1992 value. We see that even when we use the survey normalization, poverty
estimated using the optimal weighting method is much lower and falls faster than poverty estimated using
surveys alone.
Rows 6 and 7 again use assumption A5a to scale our optimal proxies, and explore the sensitivity
of our results to assumption A1: the homogeneity of the underlying statistical model across countries and
years. Row 6 presents estimates for which the relative weights have been re-estimated in each year using
a sample of countries and years with surveys in that year only. This check is important because surveys
may be improving or deteriorating over time; also, satellites in di¤erent years may have di¤erent optical
properties and record the same lights di¤erently. To avoid sharp changes in poverty estimates when weights

23

change from year to year, we normalize these estimates using a recursive formula.

7

Since in Row 7 we

allow the weights to vary cross-sectionally rather than longitudinally, no changes to the scaling assumption
are required. We see that the poverty estimates are again quite similar to the baseline, albeit with wider
con…dence intervals. Rows 8 and 9 add covariates to our baseline speci…cation in order to account for factors
that may bias light density away from true income, such as the shares of manufacturing or services in GDP
or the fraction of the population that is urban. Once again, our poverty estimates are very similar to the
baseline. Table VI presents the corresponding estimates of the developing world true income per capita
levels.8
Our last two robustness checks attempt to address conceptual problems with combining national
accounts and survey means. It is obvious (Deaton 2005, 2010) that national accounts GDP and survey mean
consumption measure two di¤erent income concepts, and that a part of their divergence is explained by this
di¤erence. It may be the case that while true income is growing faster than survey consumption, it is not
necessarily re‡ected by national accounts GDP and is in fact much closer in concept to national accounts
consumption. However, since we do not include national accounts consumption as a potential component of
our optimal proxy in our baseline speci…cation, we cannot rule this out. Row 10 adds log national accounts
consumption (household …nal consumption expenditure) as another proxy in our optimal construction of true
income, hence as yi3 in the notation of Section 4. Hence, we now compute our proxy as a weighted average
of national accounts GDP, survey means and national accounts consumption and we have three weights.
Additionally, instead of using assumption A5a to scale our optimal proxy, we instead scale the proxy to the
level of national accounts consumption: we assume that E (yi jXi ) = E yi3 jXi , and that

8 These estimates of the true income per capita levels may seem somewhat puzzling because 1) the year-speci…c weights
estimates are lower than the baseline estimates, although the poverty levels estimated with year-speci…c weights are also lower
than the baseline poverty levels, and 2) the region-speci…c weights estimates of per capita true income appear to be implausibly
large, although the poverty rates are not out of line with our other poverty estimates. However, these apparent puzzles can
be easily reconciled by noting that poverty is a nonlinear function of true income and therefore, that the lower tail of the
distribution of our estimates for true income matters more than does the uppore tail of that distribution, and potentially, more
than does the mean. We see that in fact, the lower 5% percentile of the distribution of the year-speci…c-weights true income
estimates tends to be higher than the lower 5% percentile of the distribution of the baseline true income estimates, and that
the lower 5% percentile of the distribution of the region-speci…c-weights true income estimates is very similar to that of the
baseline true income estimates. The large positive outliers for the region-speci…c-weights true income estimates matter little
for poverty estimation because they replace the top percentiles of the baseline estimates distribution, which also generate very
low poverty rates (since poverty rates are bounded below by zero).
9 Using Assumption A5a yields poverty estimates that are virtually identical to the baseline estimates.

24

poverty estimates hardly change.10 This robustness check is also notable because it shows that assumption
A5a is very similar to just scaling the optimal proxy to consumption, which appears to be consistent with
survey evidence from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS 2013).
A second problem is that if household surveys systematically mismeasure the mean of the income
distribution, they may also systematically mismeasure its dispersion. There is no reason, either based on
theory or on data, to believe that the household surveys understate income inequality, and in our case there
are good reasons to believe that they actually overstate it. Deaton (2005) presents a parametric example
in which nonresponse leads surveys to underestimate the mean but not inequality. Survey estimates of
disposable income from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS 2013) …nd mean incomes to be larger and Gini
coe¢ cients to be smaller for the several developing countries and years for which both LIS estimates and
survey estimates from Chen and Ravallion (2010) are available.11 . Finally, as discussed in Section 2, it is
very unlikely that any supplementary income indicated by the nighttime lights data (arising from proper
valuation of housing and public goods) is particularly unequally distributed as this income is embodied in
capital-intensive and bulky goods that are unlikely to be very closely held. However, in a …nal robusteness
check we will explicitly consider the possibility that the gains from global growth have been increasingly
distributed to rich people in developing countries who do not cooperate with household surveys. Such a
process would cause us to attribute to the poor the income that went to the rich and to overestimate
poverty reduction. To assess the sensitivity of our results to mismeasurement of inequality, we consider the
situation in which the Gini coe¢ cient for each survey is downward biased by a certain number of Gini points.
We select this number by computing the median within-country standard deviation of the Gini coe¢ cient
under a weighted scheme in which each country is weighted by the standard deviation of the years in which
surveys for that country are available (hence, countries with surveys over a longer period of time get more
weight), and by taking 1.96 times this number, which amounts to 5.37 Gini points. (This mismeasurement
is somewhat below the median within-country range of the Gini coe¢ cient (computed in the same manner),
which is 7.6 Gini points.) We compute poverty rates using the new inequality series in which 5.37 is added to
each country’s Gini coe¢ cient. We also compute an additional conservative estimate of the ratio of poverty
in 2010 to poverty in 1992 by using the poverty based on the new inequality data for 2010 and poverty based
on the actual CR (2010) inequality data for 1992. Such a computation would account for the possibility that
surveys become progressively worse at measuring inequality, perhaps because much growth accrues to rich
1 0 This is not surprising because the weight on the surveys remains small (the ratio to the national accounts GDP weight is
0:179). The ratio of the weight on national accounts consumption to national accounts GDP is smaller (0:113) but imprecisely
estimated. Hence, the weights are about 77% national accounts GDP, 14% surveys, and 9% national accounts consumption.
1 1 For example, the LIS survey for Brazil …nds that mean disposable income is $6000 and the Gini is 48; the Brazilian survey
cited by Chen and Ravallion (2010) …nds that mean income is $3900 and the Gini is 56. Comparisons for Colombia, Estonia,
Guatemala, Hungary, Mexico, Peru and Poland are similar.

25

people who do not participate in surveys, and this procedure would make it more di¢ cult to …nd poverty
declines. Row 11 presents the resulting estimates; under the new inequality series, poverty is higher and falls
more slowly, but is much closer to the baseline than to the survey-based poverty series, let alone the CR
(2010) estimates. We also …nd that even under our conservative procedure for computing poverty ratios, by
2010, poverty has fallen to less than 57% of its 1992 level. Table VI presents the corresponding estimates of
the developing world true income per capita levels.
The conclusion that we draw from Tables IV and Table VI is that the developing world has grown
by much more, and poverty has fallen by much more than indicated by the household surveys alone. For
all speci…cations, even the ones in which the overall scale of our true income measure is set to be the same
as that of the household surveys, poverty in 2010 (and in all other years) is estimated to be statistically
signi…cantly lower with our optimal weighting method than by using survey means alone. The di¤erence
is also practically large: our largest estimate for poverty in 2010 is 12.1%, as compared with 20.5% using
only survey means. For all speci…cations except the conservative ratio computation with measurement error
in inequality, we …nd that poverty declined by a larger percentage from 1992 to 2010 than we would …nd
based on evidence from household surveys, and that this decline happened o¤ of a lower poverty baseline.
We …nd that the most important factors a¤ecting our estimates are our choice of scaling of the true income
measure, and to a lesser extent, our assumptions about mismeasurement of inequality by the surveys. It
is intuitive that these two factors should be the most important, as, in principle, assuming very low levels
of true income or assuming that all the income growth since 1992 went to the nonpoor would be enough
to remove any poverty decline whatsoever. However, these assumptions either imply that the data we have
are systematically untrustworthy, or imply that we are away from the long-run steady state of the process
governing the evolution of national accounts and survey means.

6.3

Regional Results
Tables V and VII present poverty and true income per capita estimates for various regions of the

developing world. Each row reports a di¤erent speci…cation, which are the same speci…cations as in Tables
IV and VI. We report only a few poverty numbers for each region in order to present a compact picture, and
we only present the 2010 / 1992 poverty ratio upper con…dence bound as a tool for inference. In Table VII we
just report true income levels for 1992, 2005 and 2010 without con…dence intervals. We see much the same
pattern as for the world as a whole, with East and South Asia experiencing more rapid poverty reduction and
Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing less rapid poverty reduction. Interestingly, for all speci…cations except the
one using the survey mean normalization (row 5) and the conservative ratio using the increased inequality

26

series (last cell of row 11), Sub-Saharan Africa reduces poverty by more than 30% between 1992 and 2010,
which is statistically signi…cantly di¤erent from the 20% reduction one obtains by just using survey means
(row 2 of the table). Since both of these robustness checks are somewhat extreme (given that national
accounts get a much higher weight than surveys do, it is not particularly plausible that the scale of the
optimal true mean proxy should be so far away from its long-run value as are the survey means; it is neither
likely that African surveys drastically undermeasured inequality in 2010 relative to 1992), this suggests that
Africa is doing better than is suggested by the evidence in the household surveys.12

Conclusion
A large number of papers have attempted to estimate poverty rates around the globe. All of them

use survey data to determine the dispersion of income across citizens around a given mean to construct the
distribution of income of each country and then they estimate the poverty rates as the integral of that distribution to the left of a given poverty line. Di¤erent papers use di¤erent types of surveys, di¤erent methods
to parameterize each country’s distribution of income, di¤erent ways to interpolate and extrapolate with
missing observations, di¤erent data sources and di¤erent estimates of the mean of each country distribution
of income or consumption. Our reading of the literature is that the …nal estimates of the global poverty rate
do not depend crucially on the exact parametric speci…cations chosen by the researchers nor do they depend
on the way they interpolate or extrapolate the missing data (Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin 2009, Dhongde
and Minoiu 2010). The determining methodological choice is the choice of anchor of the income distribution.
In this sense, there are two groups of papers. There are those that anchor the distribution of income to
the national accounts’ GDP per capita [Bhalla (2002), Sala-i-Martin (2002, 2004, 2006), Pinkovskiy and
Sala-i-Martin (2009) and Sala-i-Martin and Pinkovskiy (2010)]. And then there are those that anchor the
distribution to the survey means [Chen and Ravallion (2001, 2004, 2010), Milanovic (2005)]. The choice of
the mean of the distribution matters empirically because it turns out that, for many developing countries,
the survey means not only are much smaller than the national accounts’ GDP per capita, but they also
1 2 Sala-i-Martin and Pinkovskiy (2010) use exclusively national accounts to conclude that Africa is on track to achieve the
Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty relative to the 1990 level by 2015. Our poverty ratios compare poverty in 2010
and 1992 only and therefore cannot be used to answer this question; if we forecast poverty to 2015 and compute a 2015/1992
poverty ratio we would get that Africa reduces poverty by 2015 to 55% or less of its 1992 level for all speci…cations except for
the two speci…cations mentioned in this paragraph. Our estimates of the 2010/1992 Africa poverty ratio using our baseline
weights are higher than using national accounts alone (row 2) because the baseline estimates place some positive weight on
survey means, and we know that the growth rate of surveys is smaller than the growth rate of GDP. However, it is likely that
this weight on the survey means is too large in the context of Africa. From Table III we see that the weight on surveys for the
African subsample alone is negative, in contrast with the small positive weight on surveys for the whole world sample. In row
7 of Table V we estimate the 2010/1992 African poverty ratio using the weights estimated o¤ of the African subsample only,
and we see that this ratio is actually lower than the ratio we obtain using national accounts alone.

27

grow much more slowly. Obviously, if one anchors the distribution to a smaller number, one obtains a much
larger poverty rate. And if the anchor grows at a smaller speed, the poverty rate will decline much more
slowly. Hence, the studies that use the estimated average income of the survey as the mean of each country’s
distribution tend to …nd much larger poverty rates than the studies that use per capita GDP. And they also
tend to estimate that these poverty rates fall much more slowly.
Nobody really knows why the survey means are di¤erent from the estimates of GDP per capita
(Deaton 2005). The rationale for using the national account’s GDP per capita is that the distribution
of income should be consistent with all the macroeconomic studies used to evaluate the performance of
countries. When economists say that China grew at x% per year during an entire decade, what they mean
is that its GDP per capita (not its survey means) grew at x% per year. And when they put the growth rate
for China in a cross country comparison analysis, they use the growth rate of GDP per capita. And any
measure of the distribution of income should be consistent with the most widely used measure of income:
GDP. If the survey means are smaller than GDP per capita, it must be due to some kind of misreporting on
the part of the surveyed. Economists using GDP as the anchor implicitly assume that the missing income
occurs proportionally across the entire income distribution.
Researchers that like to use the survey mean, on the other hand, argue that it is possible that
much of the income missing from the surveys goes to the nonpoor (Chen and Ravallion 2010). Hence, even
though GDP is a good measure of overall income, when it comes to estimating poverty the survey means are
much closer to the mean of the “distribution of the poor”. Since nobody knows for sure the source of the
discrepancy between GDP per capita and the survey means, we cannot be sure whose estimates of poverty
rates are more accurate.
We believe that this paper provides an avenue to solve the problem. We use a third, independently
collected data on economic activity to test whether GDP per capita or survey means are a better estimate
of true income. The data we use is satellite-recorded luminosity at night as measured by the DMSP-OLS
satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
In general, a positive correlation between measured income (national accounts or survey means) and
nighttime lights could be due to two factors: that they are both correlated with true income, or that their
measurement errors are strongly correlated with each other. However, the latter possibility is implausible
because the generating process of nighttime lights data is to a very large degree independent of the generating
process either of national accounts or of survey means. For example, measured income is collected by statisticians interacting with survey respondents, while nighttime lights are recorded impersonally by satellites.
Statistical teams use di¤erent procedures in di¤erent countries, while lights are recorded homogeneously
across national borders. Both national accounts and survey means may su¤er from nonrandom nonresponse
28

and misreporting, whereas nighttime lights do not require compliance or truthfulness of the surveyed population to record whatever lights exist. Moreover, nighttime lights may vary because of climatic conditions
such as auroral activity, cloudiness and humidity, or because of cultural attitudes towards lighting, which
presumably do not a¤ect measurement errors in national accounts or survey means. Therefore, the strength
of the correlation between nighttime lights and measured income is directly related to the strength of the
correlation between the given income measurement and the true income it is trying to measure. We can use
the ratios of correlations between nighttime lights and di¤erent income measurements to assess the relative
strengths of the correlations between these income measurements and unobserved true income.
Using data on nighttime lights we test whether national accounts or survey means better re‡ect
variation in true income across countries and over time. We …nd that national accounts do a better job. We
also use the luminosity data to create a new proxy for true income as a log linear weighted average of the
national accounts and the survey means. We …nd that the weight that we wish to place on survey means is
18% of the weight that we wish to place on national accounts GDP.
Finally, we use the new optimal measure of true income to calculate the evolution of poverty at the
worldwide level as well as at the regional level. Not surprisingly, our estimates of poverty rates are between
those of the literature that uses GDP and the literature that uses survey means. Given that our optimal
measure gives a small weight to survey means, our optimal estimates of poverty rates tend to be closer to
those reported in the research that uses GDP as the anchor. An objection could be that surveys not only
mismeasure the mean of the distribution of income, but also inequality, and that it is therefore incorrect to
combine survey-based inequality measures with income distribution means that are constructed on the basis
of national accounts. However, we show that poverty declines more rapidly if measured using our optimally
constructed means than if measured using survey means alone even if we allow for very large survey errors
in inequality measurement.
And this is the main conclusion of this paper: poverty rates have been falling much faster than
predicted by the literature that measures poverty solely using survey means.

The …rst column of Table I presents estimates and 95% con…dence intervals for the correlation between log nighttime lights
per capita and log national accounts GDP per capita, and the second column presents estimates and 95% con…dence intervals
for the correlation between log nighttime lights per capita and log survey mean income or consumption per capita, as described
in Section 5. Correlations estimated over sample of countries and years with available survey and nighttime lights data, with
701 observations and 123 di¤erent countries. Data on nighttime lights from the NOAA, data on national accounts GDP from
the World Development Indicators, and data on survey means is from Chen and Ravallion (2010). Con…dence intervals obtained
by boostrapping countries with 120 repetitions. Each row corresponds to partialling out di¤erent …xed e¤ects, mentioned in
the row headings, from the log income measures (including them in the function (Xi )).

Each column of Table II presents estimates and 95% con…dence intervals for !
^ = ^ surveys =^ N A , the ratio of the weight
of log survey means per capita to the weight of log national accounts GDP per capita in the optimal unbiased proxy zi of the
mean of the true income distribution. The di¤erent column speci…cations involve di¤erent sample survey weighting schemes,
control variables, and inclusion of national accounts consumption in zi . The baseline speci…cation weighs all surveys equally,
does not include covariate controls, and proxies zi by a combination of national accounts GDP per capita and survey means
per capita only. The bolded cell indicates the estimates that will be used in the baseline speci…cations in all subsequent tables.
Data de…nitions, inference procedures and sample selection are as in Table I. Columns 1, 3, and 5 correspond to weighting all
observations equally; columns 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 correspond to weighting all countries equally. The controls in columns 3 and
4 are: log total population, log percentage rural population, log percentage urban population. The controls in columns 5 and
6 are: log consumption share, log capital formation as percent of GDP, log shares of GDP in agriculture, manufacturing and
services, log export share, log import share, and log government expenditure share of GDP. Each row corresponds to partialling
out di¤erent …xed e¤ects, mentioned at the foot of the table, from the log income measures (including them in the function

Each row of Table IV presents estimates and 90% con…dence intervals (5% and 95% con…dence bounds) for developing
world poverty rates in selected years using the estimated proxies zi as the means of the country income distributions. Data
de…nitions, inference procedures and sample selection for the sample used to compute the weights on national accounts and
survey means in the construction of zi are as in Table I. Poverty estimates are constructed using these weights for the whole
sample of country-years of all countries not including the OECD and countries with no household surveys, and all years in the
time period 1992-2010. Poverty estimates are obtained as the fraction of the population below $1.25 a day, with the income
distribution assumed to be lognormal with mean equal to zi and variance implied by the Gini coe¢ cient from the corresponding
household survey. All estimates obtained as means of corresponding bootstrapped distributions; estimates ratios need not equal
exactly to ratios of estimates because of Jensen’s inequality. Row 1 presents estimates in which zi is set to the survey mean
(as in CR (2010)). Row 2 presents estimates in which zi is set to national accounts GDP per capita (as in PSiM (2009)).
Row 3 presents the baseline speci…cation, where the weights corresponds to the speci…cation in the bolded cells of Table II
and Table III, and Assumption A5a is invoked to …x the overall scale of zi . Row 4 presents the baseline speci…cation with the
scale based on Assumption A5b. Row 5 presents the baseline speci…cation with the scale based on Assumption A5c. Row 6
presents the baseline speci…cation from Row 3 but with additional control variables for the estimation of the weights. (log total

37

population, log percentage rural population, log percentage urban population). Row 7 presents the same speci…cation as Row
6 but with further control variables for the estimation of the weights (log consumption share, log capital formation as percent
of GDP, log shares of GDP in agriculture, manufacturing and services, log export share, log import share, and log government
expenditure share of GDP). Row 8 presents the same speci…cation as Row 3 but adds national accounts consumption per capita
as an additional component of the proxy zi , and replaces assumption A5a with an analogous assumption to A5b in which the
parameters associated with national accounts consumption are normalized. Row 9 presents the same speci…cation as Row 3
but assumes all survey Gini coe¢ cients are 5.37 Gini points higher than they are recorded to be in the household surveys. The
conservative ratio in the last cell of Row 9 assumes that the survey Gini coe¢ cients in 1992 are as reported, but the survey
Gini coe¢ cients in 2010 are 5.37 points higher than reported. We also present the upper bound for this ratio.

Each row of Table V presents estimates and 90% con…dence intervals (5% and 95% con…dence bounds) for poverty rates
in selected developing world regions using the estimated proxies zi as the means of the country income distributions. Data
de…nitions, inference procedures and sample selection for the sample used to compute the weights on national accounts and
survey means in the construction of zi are as in Table I. Poverty estimates are constructed using these weights for the whole

sample of country-years of all countries not including the OECD and countries with no household surveys, and all years in the
time period 1992-2010. Poverty estimates are obtained as the fraction of the population below $1.25 a day, with the income
distribution assumed to be lognormal with mean equal to zi and variance implied by the Gini coe¢ cient from the corresponding
household survey. All estimates obtained as means of corresponding bootstrapped distributions; estimates ratios need not equal
exactly to ratios of estimates because of Jensen’s inequality. Row 1 presents estimates in which zi is set to the survey mean
(as in CR (2010)). Row 2 presents estimates in which zi is set to national accounts GDP per capita (as in PSiM (2009)).
Row 3 presents the baseline speci…cation, where the weights corresponds to the speci…cation in the bolded cells of Table II
and Table III, and Assumption A5a is invoked to …x the overall scale of zi . Row 4 presents the baseline speci…cation with the
scale based on Assumption A5b. Row 5 presents the baseline speci…cation with the scale based on Assumption A5c. Row 6
presents the baseline speci…cation from Row 3 but with additional control variables for the estimation of the weights. (log total
population, log percentage rural population, log percentage urban population). Row 7 presents the same speci…cation as Row
6 but with further control variables for the estimation of the weights (log consumption share, log capital formation as percent
of GDP, log shares of GDP in agriculture, manufacturing and services, log export share, log import share, and log government
expenditure share of GDP). Row 8 presents the same speci…cation as Row 3 but adds national accounts consumption per capita
as an additional component of the proxy zi , and replaces assumption A5a with an analogous assumption to A5b in which the
parameters associated with national accounts consumption are normalized. Row 9 presents the same speci…cation as Row 3
but assumes all survey Gini coe¢ cients are 5.37 Gini points higher than they are recorded to be in the household surveys. The
conservative ratio in the last cell of Row 9 assumes that the survey Gini coe¢ cients in 1992 are as reported, but the survey
Gini coe¢ cients in 2010 are 5.37 points higher than reported. We also present the 95% upper bound for this ratio.

Note: Table AII presents a list of countries and relevant statistics for the calibration sample of country-years,
based on which we calculate weights on national accounts and survey means in the optimal proxy for log true income
per capita. We present the number of surveys each country has in the sample, the years of the earliest and latest
survey, and values of log World Bank GDP per capita (PPP-adjusted), log survey mean, and log lights per capita
(NOAA) corresponding to these years.

Note: Table AIII presents a list of survey means from PovcalNet (CR 2010) and from the Luxembourg Income
Study (LIS 2013), as well as a list of national accounts consumption and GDP per capita from the World Bank for
12 country-years for which both a PovcalNet survey and a LIS survey is available. It also presents the corresponding
income concept for the PovcalNet survey (the LIS income concept is household disposable income).
