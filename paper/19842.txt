ABSTRACT
In recent years, many states, including California, Texas, and Oregon, have changed admissions policies
to increase access to public universities for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. A key
concern, however, is how these students will perform. This paper examines the relationship between
high school quality and student success at college. Using newly available administrative data from
the University of Texas at Austin, we take advantage of the unique policy environment provided by
Texas’s Top Ten Percent automatic admissions law, which has not only increased the diversity of
high schools in the state that send students to the university, but also provides an admission criteria
based on a sole observable characteristic: high school class rank. We find that high school characteristics
do affect student performance, and these effects seem more pronounced for women and low-income
students. In addition, there is little evidence that the effects of high school characteristics decay over
time.

I. Introduction
In recent years, many states, including California, Texas, and Oregon, have changed
admissions policies to increase access to public universities for students from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds. As a result, students from lower-performing public high schools
are now more likely to enter a selective public university. A key concern, however, is how these
students will perform. Is their preparation sufficient to enable them to succeed? Importantly,
how can under-resourced public high schools facilitate student success in college?
Despite the obvious policy relevance, there is surprisingly little consensus in the literature
on the characteristics of a high-quality school, particularly at the high school level. Recent
advancements in data collection now enable us to examine the link between high school
characteristics and performance in college to determine which dimensions of high school quality
influence the future success of students. While there are a few recent studies attempting to
address this issue, none has addressed the inherent issues of selection of students into a
university.
This study examines the influence of high schools and high school characteristics on
early college achievement using administrative data from the University of Texas at Austin.
Importantly, we make significant efforts to control for selection into the university. The policy
environment in Texas presents an opportunity to make a unique contribution to the school quality
literature. The Top 10% Rule, passed in 1997, grants automatic admission to UT Austin to all
students who graduate from a Texas public high school ranked in the top 10% of their class.
This suggests that, regardless of school quality, the best students from each high school in Texas
can enroll at the state’s flagship university. Given that our outcome of interest—early college
achievement—is conditional on admission to the university, the law not only increases the

	  

2

diversity of high schools represented in our analysis, but moderates selection problems common
in most school quality studies. In this study, the majority of admissions decisions at UT are
based on a single observable characteristic that we can control for: the student’s high school
class rank. As a result, we focus on those students who were admitted based on the Top 10%
Rule.
In addition to selection based on admission, there is also selection based on who chooses
to enroll conditional on admission. To attempt to deal with this likely non-random selection, we
exploit numerous types of variation. In addition to controlling for an extensive list of observable
student characteristics, we also look within high schools at changes in school quality over time.
As long as student enrollment decisions (conditional on observable characteristics and school
fixed effects) are unrelated to changes in high school quality, our estimates will be unbiased.
While this is ultimately untestable, we present evidence to suggest that this may not be an
unreasonable assumption.
We find that high school quality does influence student performance in college,
regardless of the estimation strategy. High school variables measuring campus socio-economic
status (SES), academic preparation for college, and school resources all are related to college
performance, as measured by freshman year GPA. The effects of campus SES are also
significant in models including school fixed effects, suggesting that even changes within high
schools and not just differences across high schools influence college performance over time.
Importantly, we find evidence that these effects persist over time spent in college, with continued
significant effects of high school characteristics on student GPAs in sophomore and junior years.
The paper unfolds as follows. The second section describes the relevant literature.
Section 3 discusses the Texas policy environment, and Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy.

heterogeneous effects and decay, and Section 8 concludes.

II. Related Literature
There is a substantial literature relating school inputs to student performance on
standardized tests or longer-run outcomes such as earnings. (See work by Hanushek (2006) for a
review of this literature.) Despite the obvious policy relevance, less is known about the
relationship between school inputs and performance in college. Studies of college outcomes
suggest that high school effects fixed effects (Pike & Saupe, 2002; Cyrenne & Chen, 2012), high
school characteristics (Massey, 2006; Wolniak & Engberg 2010), high school curriculum
(Adelman, 1999; Pike & Saupe, 2002), and high school performance (Cohn et al., 2004; Pike &
Saupe, 2002; Cyrenne & Chen, 2012; Bettinger et al., 2011) are predictive of early college
outcomes.
Betts and Morell (1999) use individual-level data to model university GPA as a function
of high school characteristics and family background. Like the present study, Betts and Morell
analyze student data from a single elite public university. They find that individual family
background and characteristics of the high school neighborhood are significantly related to
college grade point average (GPA). They also find that teacher experience has a significant and
positive relationship with college GPA but that, like previous literature, other high school
characteristics such as pupil-teacher ratio and level of teacher education do not. A key limitation
of this work, however, is that it does not fully address non-random selection of students into the
university. Admission and then enrollment are both non-random, and controlling for observed

	  

4

individual characteristics is unlikely to sufficiently account for this selection. As a result, it is
difficult to draw inference from these results.
In related work, Fletcher & Tienda (2010) examine racial gaps in college achievement at
UT Austin, Texas A&M University, UT San Antonio, and Texas Tech University. Not
surprisingly, basic OLS models identified a racial disadvantage in achievement across the four
institutions. However, after controlling for high school fixed effects, they note that the racial gap
disappeared and, at some institutions, minority students actually achieved higher average first
semester grade point averages than white students from the same high schools. In a subsequent
paper, Fletcher & Tienda (2012) used a similar methodology to examine whether racial gaps in
college achievement varied with the economic disadvantage of sending high schools, measured
as the share of students who ever received a school lunch subsidy. Their findings suggest that
racial achievement gaps for minority students relative to white students from the same high
schools did not exist in first semester grade point averages, but appeared between the first and
sixth semesters of college for all strata of high school economic advantage. In contrast to our
own work, their work primarily focuses on racial differences in performance and, similar to the
paper by Betts and Morell, the authors do not address potential problems introduced by nonrandom selection of students into college.
Finally, recent work by Deming, Hastings, Kane and Staiger (2011) addresses the issue of
selection into high school but without detailed data at the university level. The authors find that
students who attend high schools with better observed dimensions of quality are about 6 percent
more likely to earn a bachelor’s degree. The study exploits a lottery-based school choice
program using a value-added approach, which provides the best estimated counterfactual of all
the aforementioned studies. Students who move from low-quality neighborhood schools to

	  

5

higher quality choice schools experience meaningful gains in academic preparation that lead to
degree completion (as opposed to increased information about the college-going process or
decreased the costs of applying). While we are not able to deal with selection in as convincing a
way, the Deming et al. study relies on data from the National Student Clearinghouse, and unlike
the present study, does not benefit from data about college experiences.

III. Texas Policy Environment
Prior to 1997, admission to UT Austin was based on a combination of SAT/ACT scores
and high school class rank, with discretion to increase minority enrollment. In 1996, the
Supreme Court’s ruling in Hopwood v. Texas outlawed the use of race in admissions to public
universities. To maintain racial diversity without targeting race directly, the Texas legislature
granted automatic admissions to public universities for students in the top 10% of their high
school class.

UT Austin began implementing the Top 10% Rule in 1997.

In addition to admitting all top 10% students, the university admits a much smaller
proportion of students based on a more traditional application process including high school
class rank, SAT/ACT score, high school courses taken, admissions essays, leadership,
extracurricular activities, work experience, community service, socio-economic status of the
family and high school attended, and the language spoken at home. Following the Supreme
Court’s more recent ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger, UT includes racial diversity goals as a
component of admissions for these discretionary admissions. Niu & Tienda (2010) find that the
Top 10% Rule increased the diversity of the student body at UT Austin, and increased the
number of Texas public high schools that send graduates to UT.

IV. Empirical Strategy
Much of the existing research has examined the relationship between characteristics of
the social and academic environment of high schools and student performance in college,
controlling for observable student characteristics (for example: Betts and Morell (1999), Fletcher
and Tienda (2010, 2012)). However, failure to account for the selective processes that determine
who attends a particular university from a particular high school threatens the validity of prior
findings. . The first process is selection on who is admitted to a particular university and,
conditional on admission, the second process is selection on who chooses to enroll.
To the extent that selection is not based entirely on observable characteristics and there
remains a residual relationship between college admission, college enrollment, and high school
characteristics, estimates of the relationship between high school characteristics and college
performance are likely to be biased. Importantly, the sign of the bias could go in either direction.
For example, it could be the case that in poorer high schools, only the very best students will
attend a selective public institution, while at the wealthier schools, the very best might attend
elite private universities. If the underlying distributions of student ability are equal across
schools, unobserved student ability at the public university would be negatively correlated with
school quality, which would generate a bias against finding a relationship between school
characteristics and student outcomes. However, if the underlying distributions of student ability
are very unequal across schools, with lower quality students originating from lower quality high
schools, estimates of high school effects will be biased upwards, even if the top students from all
high schools enroll at the same university.
We attempt to deal with both types of selection. In the case of admission to UT Austin,
we take advantage of the automatic admissions policy in Texas and limit our study to students in

	  

7

the top 10% of their high school class. Importantly, the Top 10% Rule is designed so high
school quality will be uncorrelated with admissions, as all schools have top-10%-eligible
students. As a result, by looking only at students from the top 10% of their graduating class, we
are able to perfectly control for admission selection.1
Conditional on admission, there is also selection on who chooses to enroll (Niu, Tienda,
& Cortes, 2006; Berkowitz & Hoekstra, 2011). Our first strategy is to control for observable
student characteristics and see how this affects the coefficient estimates for high school
characteristics. If the coefficients are not sensitive to the inclusion of the individual
characteristics, it may be reasonable to believe that the results would be robust to the inclusion of
omitted unobserved characteristics.
However, this may not be sufficient to adequately address the selection into enrollment.
As a remedy, we also estimate specifications with high school fixed effects. Controlling for
time-invariant high school effects, our identification of the effect of high school characteristics
on student performance comes from within-high-school variation in high school characteristics
over time. If a student’s decision to enroll conditional on admission and her observable
characteristics does not change within high schools over time, this identification strategy will
produce unbiased estimates.2 While we cannot test this assumption directly, as it is based on
changing unobservable characteristics of students choosing to enroll, we can test whether the
observable characteristics of the students who do decide to enroll (conditional on admission) are
varying with the high school characteristics. If we find a systematic relationship between the
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1

Students in the 11th percentile, for example, must have characteristics that warrant a discretionary admittance;
given our inability to observe these admission criteria, we do not focus on students below the top 10%.
2
Even if the decision to enroll is changing within high school over time (conditional on admission and observable
characteristics), as long as this change is not related to the changing characteristics of the high school, estimates will
remain unbiased. For example, an increase in the number of AP courses might increase the probability of
enrollment if AP credit makes college more affordable; however, as long as this is uncorrelated with unobserved
student characteristics, estimates will still be unbiased.

changing characteristics of the high school and the changing characteristics of students who are
choosing to enroll, conditional on admission, we might worry that there are also systematic
differences in unobservable characteristics that vary with high school characteristics as well.
A final source of selection is based on who attends a particular high school. Unlike the
Deming et al. paper, we do not have random assignment to high schools and must attempt to
account for student sorting into high schools. To do so, we include high school fixed effects in
our estimation and use variation within high school over time for identification. If, controlling
for observable characteristics, the unobservable characteristics of students in a high school who
ultimately enroll in UT are not changing with the characteristics of the high school, our estimates
will not be biased. The test described above works similarly for this assumption as well.
It is important to note that, while we have no perfect fix for the selection issues we face,
we are able to look across a variety of specifications that rely on very different sources of
variation to determine how sensitive our results are to the assumptions made. In this way, our
work represents a significant improvement upon the existing work.
Using only those students who were automatically admitted based on the Top 10% Rule,
we estimate the following equation:
yist = β Xist + γ Zst + ηt + εist
where y is the outcome (college GPA) for student i from high school s at time t, X is a vector of
individual student characteristics, and ηt represents year dummies. Zst is vector of high school
characteristics theoretically related to the college preparedness of graduates. We estimate this
equation both with and without high school fixed effects. As high school characteristics do not
vary across UT students from the same high school class, models that exclude high school fixed
effects include robust standard errors for clustering at the campus level.

V. Data and Variables
To test the effects of high school characteristics on college performance, this study
combines administrative student-level data from UT Austin with publicly-available public school
data from the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The UT data include merged student files from
the offices of admissions, financial aid, and registrar. Admissions files provide information on a
student’s high school attended, SAT scores, and high school class rank, along with demographics
including gender, race, family income bracket, and parent education. Financial aid records
provide information on sources of financial support and unmet financial need for all students
who completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Registrar files
include all courses completed at UT Austin or transferred from other institutions, including letter
grades and credits hours. The dataset includes approximately 50,000 entering freshman from
2002 to 2009.
Data on high school characteristics come from the Academic Excellence Indicator
System (AEIS), a public data set maintained by TEA. AEIS contains campus and school districtlevel data for all public schools in Texas including student enrollment and demographics,
staffing and financial resources, and student performance outcomes. As part of the state
accountability system for public schools, high school statistics include measures of college
readiness such as SAT and AP testing rates and performance. Based on the high school
information in a student’s admission records, we merged student and high school data to reflect
the demographic make-up of the school in the student’s senior year in high school. Variables
related to student academic performance were lagged one year to reflect the performance of

	  

10

seniors during the student’s junior year; this avoids endogeneity of student and school outcomes,
particularly at smaller high schools.
Our measure of college performance is the student’s GPA. We calculated an annual
cumulative GPA based on performance in all for-credit courses completed at UT Austin. Our
primary dependent variable is cumulative freshman year GPA. Theoretically, the first year in
college should be the period when high school experiences have the greatest influence on college
performance. We also examine the persistence of high school effects on cumulative sophomore
and junior year GPAs.
High school class rank is used to identify students eligible for automatic admission and to
control for prior student performance. We transform the numeric rank into an integer value
reflecting the student’s percentile rank in his graduating class; in this case, the best student in the
school has a percentile rank of one. We use this value to identify students who graduated in the
top 10% (i.e. high school rank is less than or equal to the top 10th percentile) and were therefore
eligible for automatic admission to UT. As an additional measure of prior performance, we also
control for SAT scores in some specifications, using the combined score on the math and verbal
exams3.
Student characteristics include the student’s age (with a quadratic term to allow for
diminishing effects of age), gender, race, parents’ income bracket, and mother’s education level,
with missing dummies for a small proportion of students with incomplete data. We also include
the log of the amount of unmet financial need to reflect financial obstacles that may influence
performance. Approximately one-third of students do not complete the FAFSA; these students

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
ACT scores were converted to SAT scores using College Board’s ACT-SAT Concordance
tables.

11

were assumed to have zero financial need, and a missing FAFSA dummy was added to the
model.
Measures of high school quality and composition were selected to reflect the important
theoretical influences of social and human capital on college performance. Measures of the
school’s social setting include economic disadvantaged measured by the percent receiving free or
reduced price lunch, racial composition, and the rate of student mobility. Student mobility is the
percent of students who transfer in or out during the school year. Measures of school-level
academic preparation for college include the percent of students taking AP exams and percent
taking SATs. Campuses focused on college preparation are expected to have higher rates of precollege testing. Measures of school resources include average years of teacher experience and
per pupil funding. Because per pupil funding is determined in part by compensatory funding and
equalization for high-risk groups, total per pupil funding is endogenous to school SES
composition. We use a disaggregated statistic of per pupil funding that includes only
expenditures on regular education programs. To measure district capacity and economies of
scale that may support college preparation for students, we include logged total district size. We
also measure pressure on the campus budget to serve high needs students with the campus’
percent special education students. All models also include year effects to reflect changing
economic or academic conditions that are common to all students.
The UT Austin dataset includes admissions and course data for 49,575 students who
entered the university between 2002 and 2009. Table 1 summarizes demographic and
performance variables for this sample. Column 1 includes all students. Column 2 includes only
those students from Texas public high schools who were eligible for automatic admission under
the Top 10% Rule. Column 3 describes the non-top-10% graduates of Texas public high schools

	  

12

who were admitted through the traditional process. Columns 4-6 include graduates of Texas
private schools, out-of-state schools, and international schools, respectively. All students are
first-time-in-college and under age 21 at the time of first enrollment.
Students in the full sample are 56 percent white, 19 percent Hispanic, 17 percent Asian,
and 5 percent Black. Fifty-five percent have a mother who graduated from college, and 50
percent have incomes of $80,000 or above. Approximately 20 percent have mothers who never
attended college, and 20 percent report family incomes below $40,000. Sixty-three percent of
the students completed a FAFSA. Assuming those with no FAFSA have zero unmet need, the
average unmet financial need is approximately $3,000.
Approximately 63 percent of the freshmen enrolled were eligible for automatic admission.
Automatic-admission students are more likely to be female and less likely to be white than
students admitted through traditional applications. They are also more likely to have low family
income and low mother’s education, and they enter college with approximately $200 more in
average unmet financial need than the average student. Not surprisingly, average class rank is
highest among the automatic admits, but average SATs are higher among those admitted through
traditional applications. While the highest average college GPAs are achieved by graduates of
private, out-of-state, and international high schools, automatic admits have a higher average
freshman year GPA than those admitted through the traditional admissions from Texas public
high schools.
Table 2 summarizes high school characteristics at the student level for graduates of Texas
public high schools disaggregated by automatic or traditional admissions. Automatic admits, on
average, come from high schools that have higher rates of free/reduced lunch, minority
enrollment, and student mobility. On average, these high schools also have lower college

	  

13

preparation, with 21 percent AP tested and 69 percent SAT tested, compared to 30 percent AP
tested and 80 percent SAT tested at high schools attended by traditional admits.
Our analytic sample for regression analysis includes all students who qualified for
automatic admissions based on observable class rank and for whom full high school data are
available. A number of high schools had incomplete data in the TEA database; this reduced the
sample to 27,392 students. Table 3 presents summary statistics of individual and school
characteristics of the analytic sample. The analytic sample has slightly higher average class rank
and SAT scores than the full sample of automatically admitted students, but the two samples are
identical across all demographic variables. Mean high school characteristics (for non-missing
variables) are nearly identical for the full and analytic samples.
Importantly, because of the state admission policy, there is significant variation in
sending school characteristics. During the study period from 2002 to 2009, graduates from more
than 800 Texas public high schools entered UT Austin as freshmen. These campuses are
relatively diverse with average free/reduced lunch rates over 40 percent and more than 50
percent minority enrollment (Appendix 1). The diversity of feeder schools has changed over
time following initial implementation of the Top 10% Rule in 1997 (Appendix 2). The number
of feeder high schools rose from 616 in 2002 to almost 700 in 2009, while the number of UT
Austin enrollees per feeder campus declined. As a comparison with a traditional admissions
process, the feeder high schools of automatic admits reflect more student diversity, lower SES,
and lower average college preparation than Texas public schools that graduated traditional
admits to UT during the same time. High school campuses that did not send graduates to UT
Austin display the lowest levels of academic preparation for college with only 5 percent of
students AP tested and less than half of students SAT tested.

VI. Results
Regression results
The first set of regressions estimates freshman year GPA as a function of high school
characteristics with year dummies and a variety of individual level controls. These models
control for selection into admission by limiting the sample to automatic admits (students in the
top 10%). Model (1) includes high school characteristics and year dummies without individual
characteristics, Model (2) adds individual student demographics and high school class rank
(expressed as percent of senior class), and Model (3) adds student characteristics, high school
class rank, and student SAT scores. Note that, in Model 3, we are likely overcontrolling for
student characteristics, as student SAT performance is likely affected by high school quality.
Standards errors in these estimations are robust to clustering at the high school campus level.
High school variables were selected to minimize multicollinearity from related measures,
while reflecting the socioeconomic setting of the school (percent free/reduced lunch, percent
black, percent Hispanic, student mobility rate), the average level of pre-college academic
preparation (percent of students AP tested and percent SAT tested), school resources (logged per
pupil expenditures on regular education programs, average years of teacher experience),
competition for resources from high-needs students (percent special education), and district
economics of scale (logged district total enrollment).4
Table 4 shows the estimated relationship between high school characteristics and
freshman year GPA. With the exception of per pupil expenditures, coefficient estimates are
significant and have the expected sign in all three models: low campus SES and campus percent
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
on individual characteristics are generally as expected and similar across
specifications (Appendix 3). Controlling for other factors, female students have significantly
higher GPAs, while minority race, low mother’s education, and low family income are
associated with significantly lower GPAs.

special education is associated with lower freshman GPA and higher average college preparation,
average teacher experience, and district size are associated with higher freshman GPA.
Observable dimensions of high school quality explain approximately 20 percent of the variation
in freshman GPA.
Importantly, statistical significance and effect sizes are similar across models with and
without student controls, suggesting that observable student characteristics among those who
enroll at the university are not highly correlated with the characteristics of the sending high
schools. This may suggest that once we limit the sample to students admitted solely on the basis
of their class rank, OLS results with individual controls may be sufficient for dealing with
selection.5
Holding student characteristics constant, higher-performing UT students attended high
schools with higher average SES, better average college preparation, more experience teachers,
district economies of scale, and less budget pressure from high needs students. Based on the
estimates from Model (2), district economies of scale and student SES have the largest influence
on college performance. A one standard deviation increase in district size is associated with an
increase of 0.27 grade points in freshman GPA. A one standard deviation increase in the percent
free/reduced lunch is associated with a decrease of 0.10 grade points. The estimated effects of
racial composition are smaller. A one standard deviation increase in the percent Hispanic or
Black on the high school campus is associated with an estimated decrease in GPA of only 0.05 to
0.06 grade points. Student mobility and special education have smaller sizes of less than 0.04
grade points. A one standard deviation increase in percent AP tested is associated with an

We also tested the models using a less restricted sample including all freshmen who graduated from Texas public
high schools and a more restrictive sample including only the top five percent of Texas public high school graduates.
The estimated effects of high school characteristics are similar across alternative samples and across specifications
within samples.

estimated increase of 0.04 grade points, while a one standard deviation increase in the percent
SAT tested is associated with a slightly larger 0.06 increase.
Even with controls for student characteristics, it is possible that these results reflect
student selection into UT conditional on admission or sorting into high schools by unobserved
characteristics. We also estimate the effects of high school characteristics on college GPA
including campus fixed-effects, which controls for unobserved high school campus differences
that influence college performance and that are unchanging over time.
As a test for whether we are adequately controlling for selection into our sample by using
the school fixed effects strategy, we first examine the relationship between high school
characteristics and student observable characteristics, controlling for high school fixed effects. If
changes in high school characteristics within a school over time are unrelated to changing
demographics of graduates enrolled at UT from that school, this suggests that the unobservable
characteristics are also unlikely to be related to changing school characteristics and thus we are
not facing much selection bias.
Some relationships between school composition and individual characteristics are
expected regardless of selection – for example a campus that is becoming more white will
become more likely to send a white student to UT than a campus that is becoming more Hispanic,
and a campus with an increasing number of students on free/reduced lunch will be increasingly
more likely to send a low-income student to UT than a campus that is becoming more affluent.
On the other hand, if the change in a measure of school quality such as average teacher
experience is positively associated with the change in the number of white students enrolling
(even with controls for school composition), we might conclude that admission into UT Austin

	  

17

under the Top 10% Rule and the inclusion of school fixed effects do not adequately control for
selection of whites into higher quality high schools.
Results of these regressions relating high school characteristics and enrolled students
characteristics, including high school fixed effects are displayed in Table 5. Overall, few school
characteristics are significant predictors of student demographics. As expected, free/reduced
lunch significantly predicts the student’s income bracket and campus racial composition predicts
the student’s race in some models. There are a small number of unexpected, significant
relationships, such as percent SAT tested and district size predicting the probability of being
female’ but, overall, the estimations suggest no systematic relationship between changes in high
school characteristics and the changing demographic make-up of freshmen from a particular high
school. The low R-squared statistics (all less than 0.014) also indicate that high school
characteristics are weak predictors of the demographics of automatically admitted UT students.
Given this suggestive evidence that high school fixed effects may help alleviate the
residual selection problem, Table 6 displays results for regressions on the automatic admission
sample including high school fixed effects. Controlling for both high school and time fixed
effects, the regression coefficients estimate the effect of within-school changes in social
environment, academics, and resources on college performance of graduates. Both with and
without student controls, we find a significant negative effect of the percent free/reduced lunch
and percent black, and a positive significant effect of average teacher experience. Effect sizes are
similar to the estimations without fixed effects. A one standard deviation increase in the percent
free/reduced lunch on a high school campus is associated with a decrease of 0.10 grade points,
and a one standard deviation increase in the percent Black is associated with a decrease of 0.08
grade points. The effects of other high school variables are not significant in the fixed effect

	  

18

models. It is likely that many of these high school characteristics did not vary sufficiently within
campuses during the period of this study. The fixed effects results confirm the presence of some
significant changes in high school SES that influence college performance, while also suggesting
that unmeasured aspects of high school quality are also influential.
VII. Decay and Heterogeneous Effects
Decay
It is possible that the effects of high school quality on college performance diminish or
disappear over time after graduation. We test whether the effects of high schools last beyond a
student’s freshman in college year by using cumulative sophomore and junior GPAs as
dependent variables. Approximately 15 percent of the freshman in the automatic admissions
analytic sample dropped out before the end of junior year, leaving 23,411 students with complete
information on freshman, sophomore, and junior year GPAs. Excluding dropouts changes the
composition of the sample to only those students who were socially, financially, and
academically able to remain at UT.6
Table 7 displays the estimated effects of high school characteristics on college GPAs in
the freshman, sophomore, and junior year for this reduced sample. All estimates in Table 7
include year dummies and student covariates, replicating Model (2) above. In order to verify
that our results are not being driven by the changing sample, we first re-estimate the freshman
year GPA regression on the reduced sample for comparison. The estimates of freshman GPA
without fixed effects are similar for this reduced, non-dropout sample and the larger analytic
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

6	  Table

3 compares the subsample of students who persisted through junior year with the full sample of freshman
and the analytic from the regression above. As expected, those who persist are slightly better off in terms of
mother’s education and family income. Persisters are also more likely to be female and less likely to be Hispanic or
Black than the larger analytic sample. High school characteristics also differ slightly. The persistence sample has
lower campus average rates of free/reduced lunch, minority enrollment, mobility, and higher rates of testing and
higher average teacher experience, although all these differences are small.

sample (Column 1). All high school characteristics except per pupil funding are significant
predictors of freshman GPA. Effect sizes for freshman year GPA are statistically similar to the
larger analytic sample. The estimate of freshman year GPA with high school fixed effects for
the persistence sample (Column 4) is also similar to the larger analytic sample with significant
negative effects of campus SES, as well as significant positive effects of SAT testing and teacher
experience.
We see very little decay in the estimated effects sizes of high school characteristics from
the freshman to sophomore and junior years. In the estimates without fixed effects (Columns 13), the same high school characteristics are significant predictors of GPA during freshman,
sophomore, and junior year. The significant estimated effects percent free/reduced lunch, Black,
Hispanic, mobility, AP testing, SAT testing, teacher experience, and special education decrease
by 0.01 grade points or less while in college. The effect of district size diminishes by 0.03.
Overall, these estimates show striking stability of high school effects throughout college for
students that remain enrolled.
Adding high school fixed effects (Columns 4-6), we observe similarly small decreases in
the effects of changes in percent free/reduced lunch and percent Black over time. The positive
significant effects of SAT testing and teacher experience on the persistence sample disappear in
the sophomore and junior years. In terms of effect sizes, a one standard deviation increase in
either percent SAT tested or high school teacher experience would increase freshman GPA by
0.02 points, with no effect in later years. However, these later effects were not significant for the
larger sample of all freshmen.
Heterogeneous Effects

	  

20

Our final analysis examines whether high school effects on college performance are
consistent when we disaggregate across demographic groups. Table 8 displays results for
estimations by gender, race, and income. The first set of results includes controls for student
demographics, high school characteristics, class rank, and year. Table 9 displays similar results
but includes high school fixed effects. The results without fixed-effects are consistent with the
results for the full analytic sample. Coefficients on the high school’s percent free/reduced lunch,
percent Black, and percent Hispanic are significant and negative for all subgroups. The mobility
rate is significant and negative for all groups except high-income students. The percent SAT
tested is significant and positive for all subgroups. District size and percent special education are
significant for all groups but white students. Average teacher experience and percent AP tested
are also significant for some, but not all subgroups.
In general, we find fewer significant coefficients when we add high school fixed effects.
There are a few notable examples that suggest that within school changes in high school
variables have different effects on different types of students. There are significant effects
associated with percent free/reduced lunch and teacher experience for females, but not males,
while males are influenced by a high school’s black minority share while females are not.
Average teacher experience is a significant predictor of freshman GPA for Hispanics but not for
Blacks or Whites. GPAs of low-income students are influenced by percent free/reduced lunch,
while GPAs of high-income students are influenced by teacher quality.
VIII. Conclusion
This study is the first to estimate the effects of high school quality by exploiting an
automatic admissions policy in order to address some of the selection problems inherent to any
study of students’ college outcomes. Student performance in college is dependent on a series of

	  

21

sorting processes including selecting into high schools, selecting into college admissions, and
selecting into college enrollment. Texas policy adds transparency to this process by selecting
into admissions based on a single observed student characteristic. In the Texas case, a large and
diverse group of high schools serve as feeders for the flagship state university through automatic
admissions, offering rich heterogeneity in high school characteristics. Our results suggest that
under this policy, high school characteristics are, for the most part, not predictive of student
background characteristics, and high school characteristics are predictive of student academic
outcomes. .
We find that high school variables measuring campus SES, academic preparation for
college, and school resources are related to college performance, as measured by freshman year
GPA. The effects of campus SES are significant in models including high school fixed effects,
suggesting that even changes within high schools, and not just differences across high schools,
influence students’ college performance over time. Importantly, we find that the effects of high
school on college performance persist at least through junior year.
Although the effect sizes of individual dimensions of high school quality are small, the
aggregate effect of multiple dimensions is meaningful. As an example, we estimate a predicted
GPA for a simulated student with high school characteristics from two different campuses – one
of the highest-ranked and one of the lowest-ranked high schools in the Houston area. Our
simulated student is female, Hispanic, age 18, and has a mother with a high school diploma,
family income between $20,000-40,000, and $1,000 in unmet financial need. Graduating from
the high-performing high school, this student’s estimated freshman year GPA 3.21. Graduating

	  

22

from the low performing high school, her estimated GPA is only 2.30 – a difference of over 1.6
standard deviations.7
Overall, our results support the hypothesis that high school quality matters in college and
continues to influence students throughout their college careers. The population studied reflects
top-ranked graduates of public high schools attending an elite flagship state university where
admissions policies have created a very diverse pool of feeder high schools. Although this
context may not be typical of elite universities with traditional admissions processes, it offers the
opportunity to examine high school effects with reduced selection bias and greater heterogeneity
of high school quality in a single university setting. Overall, the results suggest that the
influence of high school lasts well beyond graduation.
Policy discussions of improving “college readiness” of high school graduates have
largely taken place without information about what components of high school quality matter for
college success. Automatic admissions policies increase access to public universities, but do not
directly influence high schools to implement programs that help graduates succeed in college.
Universities offer many programs to overcome inequities among admitted students (such as
mentoring programs, development education, peer supports, etc.), but lack tools to diagnose need
and target interventions. Particularly under automatic admissions, almost all students enroll at
elite public universities with a history of exemplary academic performance. Without appropriate
controls for selection into college, it is a challenge to apply previous research findings to
determine if interventions should be targeted based on individual characteristics, family
background, or high school experiences. The results of this study suggest that high school
background does influence college academic performance and that students from schools with

The simulation is based on results for Model 2 in Table 4, which controls for student characteristics and excludes
high school fixed effects.

multiple sources of disadvantage are a likely target for interventions at college entry. At the
same time, our results suggest that high school programs that promote college preparation may
be helpful for beneficiaries of automatic admissions policies, particularly those students who
enter college from high schools that have not historically sent a large proportion of graduates to
elite universities.
