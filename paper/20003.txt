ABSTRACT
Guided by a macroeconomic model in which commodity prices are endogenously determined, we
apply a new factor-based identification strategy to decompose the historical sources of changes in
commodity prices and global economic activity. The model yields a factor structure for
commodity prices and identification conditions that provide the factors with an economic
interpretation: one factor captures the combined contribution of shocks that affect commodity
markets only through general-equilibrium forces. Applied to a cross-section of commodity prices
since 1968, the theoretical restrictions are consistent with the data and yield structural
interpretations of the common factors in commodity prices. Commodity-related shocks have
contributed modestly to global economic fluctuations.

Introduction

Between January 2003 and July 2008, the prices of most major commodities grew rapidly: wheat by 120%, copper
by 363%, aluminum by 100% and nickel by 138%. Many observers concluded that the simultaneous rise in prices
across such a broad cross-section of commodities reflected a common cause—an increase in the global demand for
commodities due to growth in emerging Asia and especially China. Other episodes of widespread comovement in
commodity prices have similarly suggested that global demand is a common source of movements in commodity
prices, such in the early 1970s or in the late 1990s. But this explanation is not necessarily the only one: exogenous
changes in the prices of oil and other energy products could simultaneously drive the prices of many non-energy
commodities because of the important role played by transportation costs in their distribution. In addition, changing
preferences on the part of consumers could shift the demand for commodity-intensive products, as could
technological changes that affect the relative importance of raw materials in the production of consumption goods.
Decomposing the sources of commodity price comovement is therefore inextricably linked to identifying the sources
of global business cycle fluctuations.
In this paper, we develop and implement a new methodology for decomposing the sources of commodity
price comovement and global business cycle fluctuations. Underlying this methodology is a general-equilibrium
model of global business cycles with commodities that predicts a factor structure for real commodity prices. The
predicted factor structure decomposes the sources of global business cycle fluctuations and commodity price
movements, and the theory suggests several ways to recover a structural interpretation to the common factors
extracted from commodity prices. In other words, this methodology provides a way to use the comovement in
commodity prices to disentangle the simultaneous determination of commodity prices and business cycles.
The factor structure in commodity prices predicted by the model separates exogenous forces (or “shocks”)
into two types. The first set of shocks includes those that directly shift the supply and demand curves for commodities
and thus would affect commodity prices, even in the absence of general-equilibrium changes in aggregate income,
though such forces may also have general-equilibrium effects on aggregate income and therefore additional indirect
effects on commodity prices. We refer to these factors as direct factors. They potentially reflect a variety of common
shocks to the prices of inputs used to produce commodities, such as labor or energy, common productivity shocks,
or demand factors such as changes in the relative need for commodities to produce final consumption goods. The
second set of shocks includes those that affect commodity prices only indirectly through their effects on aggregate
output. We refer to these as indirect factors. The indirect effects can come through two channels. One is the standard
demand channel. When aggregate economic activity is high, the demand for commodities used to produce the final
good is also high, thereby raising the prices of all commodities. The second is a supply-side channel. When aggregate
income is high, agents may be less willing to supply the inputs used to produce commodities because of income
effects, thereby pushing up the prices of commodities. Both channels induce positive comovement in the prices of
commodities.

2

The theory predicts a new result about indirect shocks. Because their effects on commodity prices are
summarized entirely by their effects on aggregate output, each of the indirect shocks induces the same comovement
among commodity prices. As a result, their combined effect on commodity prices can be aggregated into a single
factor. Furthermore, this factor has a precise structural interpretation in the model. It corresponds to the
counterfactual level of global economic activity that would have been obtained without direct commodity shocks.
Identifying this factor therefore provides a new way to recover historical changes in global economic activity and
commodity prices that reflect endogenous responses to non-commodity-related shocks.
However, because standard empirical factor decompositions identify factors only up to a rotation, one cannot
immediately recover the indirect common factor from a simple factor decomposition of commodity prices. The
second element of our approach is to impose identification conditions, again grounded in the predictions of the
theoretical model, to recover the direct and indirect factors underlying commodity price movements. The theoretical
model provides two ways to do this: sign restrictions on factor loadings of the indirect common factor and
orthogonality conditions with respect to a set of instruments for either the direct or indirect factors. Using a crosssection of 40 non-energy commodity prices available since 1968, we apply both identification strategies to identify
the indirect factor and find similar results across specifications, indicating that the results are robust to the choice of
identification strategy and instruments.
Our main empirical finding is that the vast majority of historical commodity price movements are associated
with the indirect factor, i.e., broad-based changes in commodity prices can largely be attributed to a generalequilibrium response to aggregate non-commodity shocks rather than direct shocks to commodity markets. While
there are a number of historical episodes during which direct shocks to commodity markets played some role in
accounting for commodity price movements and changes in global production (e.g., 1979–80, the run-up in
commodity prices in the 2000s and the decline in prices in 2008–09), the primary source of commodity price
movements is their endogenous response to non-commodity-related shocks.
Our approach is related to the literature on the macroeconomic effects of shocks to oil and commodity prices
(Bosworth and Lawrence 1982; Hamilton 1983; Barsky and Kilian 2002; Hamilton 2009; Blinder and Rudd 2012;
Stuermer 2017) as well as a growing body of recent research on identifying the sources of oil price movements
following Kilian (2009). We differ from this line of research in that we focus on a broad range of non-energy
commodities (rather than just oil), which are essential to implement our identification strategy. Second, our
identification strategy is new: we apply factor methods that decompose the comovement across different commodity
prices then exploit the predictions about this decomposition from a microfounded model to identify the structural
sources of fluctuations in commodity prices and aggregate output.1 Third, while identification in VARs of

We are not the first to apply factor methods to commodity prices. Some papers have examined whether there is excess
comovement among unrelated commodities—that is, price comovement in excess of what one would expect, conditional on
macroeconomic fundamentals (e.g. Pindyck and Rotemberg 1990). Other papers have investigated the forecasting performance
of the common factor in metals prices for individual metals prices (West and Wong 2014) and commodity convenience yields
for inflation (Gospodinov and Ng 2013). But there has been little attempt at interpreting the resulting factors in a structural sense.

commodity markets decomposes shocks into supply and demand shocks, our general-equilibrium model allows for
the fact that exogenous forces should tend to have both supply and demand effects.
Our model provides a structural interpretation of a factor representation for commodity prices along with the
requisite identification conditions, so that we are able to disentangle the different economic channels underlying
commodity price movements. In this respect, our approach is related to work that uses economic theory to assign
factors an economic interpretation (e.g. Forni and Reichlin 1998). Other work identifies the factors driving
macroeconomic aggregates common to all countries and specific subsets of countries (Stock and Watson 2005; and
Kose et al. 2012). Factor methods have also been used to identify relative price changes for specific goods and the
absolute price changes common to all goods (Reis and Watson 2010) and the relative importance of aggregate and
sector-specific shocks for U.S. industrial production (Foerster et al. 2011). Our paper differs from this line of research
in that we use commodity price dynamics to identify the sources of global business cycle fluctuations and in our
identification strategy, which relies on the use of sign restrictions and orthogonality conditions rather than zero
restrictions on the factor loadings.
Finally, we also show that our factor-based method can help with forecasting commodity prices. Using
recursive out-of-sample forecasts, we find that a bivariate factor-augmented VAR with each commodity’s price and
the first common factor extracted from the cross-section of commodities generates improvements in forecast
accuracy relative to the no-change forecast, particularly at short horizons. This result extends to broader commodity
price indices as well as real oil prices. An additional advantage of our approach is that it relies only on commodity
prices that can be readily updated at monthly or quarterly frequencies and does not require information about
production and inventory data that are often unavailable at these frequencies. Our approach thus provides a unified
framework to forecast commodity prices in real-time as well as a structural interpretation of these forecasts.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a general-equilibrium business cycle
model with commodities and shows how the model can be used to assign a structural interpretation to the common
factors in commodity prices. The section also shows how to recover the economic factors from typical factor
decompositions through identification restrictions. Section 3 applies these results to a historical cross-section of
commodity prices. Section 4 uses the indirect common factor in a recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise.
Section 5 concludes.

The Sources of Commodity Price Comovement: Theory

In this section, we present a model that characterizes the sources of commodity price comovement. In particular, we
show that the model yields a tractable factor structure for a cross-section of commodity prices, which permits an
economic interpretation of the factors.
2.1

Model of commodity prices

4

The baseline model consists of households, an energy-producing sector, a continuum of heterogeneous primary
commodities, a sector that aggregates these commodities into a single intermediate commodity input, and a final
goods sector that combines commodities, labor and technology into a final good.
The Household
A representative consumer maximizes expected discounted utility over consumption ( ), labor supplied to the final
good sector (

With

> 0, welfare is decreasing in hours worked in either sector. The

term is an exogenous shock

to the disutility of hours worked in the final goods sector.2
The household pays a price

for labor in the energy sector. The household also can purchase risk-free

that pay a gross nominal interest rate of

The Energy Production Sector
A representative energy firm produces a total supply of the energy good (Σ ) subject to an exogenous energy-specific
productivity shock (Ξ ) and a decreasing returns production function that uses energy-specific labor (
Ξ

,

,

): Σ =

. This representative firm takes the price of the energy good ( ) as given and therefore chooses how

much labor to hire to maximize its profits which are given by

The Primary Commodity-Production Sector
There is a continuum of primary commodities of mass 1. Each primary commodity j is produced by a representative
price-taking firm which uses energy Σ ( ) to produce an amount of the commodity

diminishing returns to energy and is in equilibrium equal to the ratio of firm j’s expenditures on energy to its total

2

One could alternatively model the household as providing a single type of labor which can be used in both the final goods
and energy sector. This would not change the qualitative results. One could also introduce a preference shock to the
household’s willingness to supply labor the energy sector but this would have the same qualitative effects as the productivity
shock in the energy sector.

( ) and the price of energy

, the firm chooses the amount of energy

input to maximize profits.
We assume the steady-state level of productivity ( ) is such that the steady-state level of production in each sector
is equal. Equilibrium in the supply and demand for energy requires that Σ =

Σ() .

The Intermediate Commodity
A perfectly competitive sector purchases

( )=

setup implicitly assumes that no storage of commodities takes place, since all commodities produced must be used
in the same period. We discuss the rationale for this assumption and its implications in more detail in Appendix I.

the final good is purchased by the household, equilibrium in the final goods market requires

. The fact that

may be time-varying allows for exogenous variation in the relative demand for commodities and labor in the
production of the final good.
The Linearized Model
A detailed solution of the model is provided in Appendix A. We assume that exogenous processes are stationary
around their steady-state levels, so that all real variables are constant in the steady state. Lower-case letters denote
log deviations from steady state (e.g.,
level of final goods (e.g.,
( )≡

( ) 1+

( ) ≡ log

≡ log

− log ̅ ), and we normalize the nominal variables by the price
− log( ( )/ ). We normalize commodity-specific productivity as

to simplify the aggregation across commodities, where

/ . 4 We assume that the productivity process for each commodity sector has an idiosyncratic component

3

One could allow the final goods sector to also use energy in its production process without changing any of the qualitative
results in the factor structure of commodity prices.
4
The rescaling of the commodity-specific productivity process ensures that a 1% increase in productivity in each commodity
sector raises the equilibrium level of production of that commodity by equal amounts for each commodity. This would not be
the case without the rescaling because each primary commodity sector’s supply curve has a different slope.

stationary, but we do not need to otherwise specify the specific process followed by each. 5
As shown in Appendix 1, the aggregate level of production of final goods can be expressed in terms of
exogenous forces:

variation in the household’s willingness to supply land, as well as energy-specific and commodity-specific
productivity shocks. Whether output rises when the relative demand for commodities increases (

specific parameter values.
2.2

Comovement and the Factor Structure of Commodity Prices

As shown in Appendix 1, the supply of commodity j can be written in reduced form as:
( )=

( )+

+

+

Ξ ++

+

(2)

Because different commodities have different returns to energy in the production process, the slope of their supply
curves (given by ) will generally differ. The supply curve of each commodity shifts up with increases in aggregate
income

regardless of its source: greater aggregate production raises the price of energy and therefore the price of

commodity j (

>0). The price of energy is higher when aggregate income rises because that higher income induces

the household to reduce its supply of labor to the energy sector (which raises

and therefore the price of energy)

and because higher aggregate income implies a greater aggregate demand for energy which also causes the price of
energy to rise. Hence, any shock that affects aggregate income in this model is a supply shock from the point of view
of a given commodity. In addition, productivity shocks in the commodity sector or productivity shocks to the energy
sector will induce an additional shift of the supply curve, holding constant their effect on aggregate production, as
will shocks to the relative demand for commodities (which affect energy prices and therefore change cost of
producing commodities). Hence, these shocks have a direct effect on the supply of commodities, above and beyond
the general equilibrium effects that all shocks have on supply via their effects on aggregate income.
The demand for commodity j can similarly be written in reduced form as:
( )=−

( )+

+

5

+

Ξ +

.

(3)

Because we do not need to specify the specific time series process followed by each exogenous variable, we will frequently
refer to these exogenous variables as “shocks” with obvious abuse of terminology, instead of referring explicitly to the
innovations that generate variation in each exogenous variable.

7

Given the setup of the model, all commodities have the same elasticity of demand. In addition, all commodities
experience in rise in demand from any increase in aggregate production, regardless of its source (

> 0) which

simply reflects the role of commodities as an input into the production of final goods. This term therefore captures
general-equilibrium demand effects, and all macroeconomic shocks that affect aggregate production in the model
result in an equal upward or downward shift in the demand for each commodity. Thus, all shocks in the model other
than idiosyncratic shocks are both demand and supply shocks. However, in addition to these general-equilibrium
shifts in commodity demand, the demand for commodity j rises with changes in the relative demand for commodities
( ), holding aggregate output constant. It also shifts, holding aggregate output constant, with exogenous common
commodity productivity shocks (which increase the demand for all commodities on the part of the final goods sector)
and exogenous shocks to energy (which affect the relative demand for all commodities).
As can be seen from the supply and demand curves above, there are two aggregate shocks that affect
aggregate output but do not directly impact commodity prices other than through general equilibrium effects on
output:

and

. We will refer to these variables as “indirect” shocks that affect commodity prices only through

their general equilibrium effects on output. It’s helpful to decompose movements in output coming from these
variables vs other exogenous forces:
( ,

=
where

=

[

+

)+

Ξ +

+

] is the level of aggregate output coming exclusively from changes in aggregate

productivity and changes in the willingness of households’ to supply labor to the final goods sector.
As shown in Appendix A, we can then rewrite the equilibrium price of commodity j as

> 1 and

(1 − ) − 1 > 0.

Equation (4) provides a factor structure for real commodity prices with three distinct and orthogonal
components.6 The last term on the right-hand side reflects idiosyncratic shocks to commodity j that have no aggregate
real effects. The second set of terms on the right-hand side consist of a factor for each exogenous force that has both
direct and indirect effects on the commodity market (i.e., that shifts the supply or demand for commodities, holding
aggregate output constant, but also ultimately leads to changes in aggregate output). For this reason, we refer to these

6

The differences in factor loadings across commodities in equation (4) stem only from differences in slopes of commodity
supply curves, which are themselves a reflection of the different energy intensities of production across commodities.
Appendix 2 considers a version of the model where industrial and agricultural commodities are aggregated into two different
intermediate commodity bundles, both of which are used in final production, but in which the aggregation occurs with
different elasticities of substitution. The factor structure is preserved, even though commodities now differ in both the slopes
of their supply curves as well as their demand curves. This alternative representation of the model also illustrates that the
aggregation of shocks underlying the factor structure of commodity prices does not hinge on the use of CES aggregation of all
commodities into a single commodity intermediate input.

factors as “direct common” (DC) factors. In this setup, there are three such factors: exogenous shocks to energy
sector, a common productivity shock to commodities, and a shock to the relative demand for commodities in the
production of final goods. Because these forces have both direct and indirect effects on the market for commodity j,
there is, in general, no guarantee that their respective loadings have the same signs across commodities. However, it
should be the case that commodities which are more intensive in energy (larger

) should have prices which respond

more strongly to exogenous energy price shocks.
The most interesting component of the factor structure is the first term on the right-hand side of (4), which
reflects the combined contribution on the price of commodity j from all shocks whose effects on commodity prices
operate only indirectly through aggregate output (i.e., only through general-equilibrium effects). We refer to this
common factor as the “indirect common” (IC) factor. It captures the fact that, because some shocks affect commodity
markets only through changes in aggregate output, they all have identical implications for the price of a given
commodity, conditional on the size of their effect on aggregate output, and induce the same comovement across
different commodity prices. As a result, they can be represented as a single factor. Furthermore, this factor has a
well-defined interpretation: it is the counterfactual level of global output that would have occurred in the absence of
any direct commodity shocks. Thus, this common factor represents a way to reconstruct the counterfactual history of
aggregate output without direct commodity shocks, as well as to decompose historical commodity price changes into
those components reflecting direct commodity shocks versus all other aggregate economic forces captured by the IC
factor. Unlike the DC factors, another key characteristic of the IC factor is that all the loadings on this factor must
be positive (

> 0 ∀ ). This prediction reflects the fact that the shocks incorporated in the IC factor raise commodity

demand when the shock is expansionary and simultaneously restrict the commodity supply through income effects,
which unambiguously increases commodity prices.7 In short, this factor decomposition provides a new way to
separate causality in the presence of simultaneously determined prices and production levels.
2.3

Recovering a Structural Interpretation of the Factors

A key limitation of factor structures is that, empirically, factors are identified only up to a rotation. For example, if
one estimated a factor structure on commodity prices, one could not directly associate the extracted factors with the
structural interpretation suggested by (4). However, the theory developed in this section has implications that can be
used to identify the unique rotation consistent with those predictions and permits us to assign an economic
interpretation to the factors driving commodity prices.
To see this, suppose that, as in the theory above, the N variables in vector
prices have a factor structure

=

+

where

(N by 1) of real commodity

is a K by 1 vector of unobserved variables, and

7

is an N by K

The prediction that all commodities have the same sign loading on the common factor is sensitive to the assumption of
diminishing returns to scale in production of commodities, which generates upward-sloping supply curves. Downward sloping
supply curves (coming from increasing returns) would imply that when global production is high, the increased demand would
now reduce commodity prices (since supply slopes down), while the income effect would raise it (as before). Whether
commodity prices went up would therefore depend on the relative strengths and slopes of each effect.

factor analysis: (a) ( ) = 0, (b) ( ) = 0, (c) (

( ) = , so that the factors are orthogonal

such that

do not, in general, permit the economic identification of the factors

but rather some rotation

.

However, the model provides additional restrictions on the factor structure that can be used to assign an
economic interpretation to the factors and identify the “structural” factors

from the estimated factors

. For

example, consider the factor structure of equation (4) in section 2.3 in which real commodity prices reflect two
underlying factors, an exogenous energy shock (Ξ ) and the level of aggregate production that would have occurred
in the absence of this shock (

=[

), thus

]′ =

Ξ ′. As we discuss below, this two-factor structure is

the most empirically relevant case. A factor decomposition of commodity prices would yield a rotation of these
factors

such that

cos
− sin

[

where the last equality reflects the properties of rotation matrices. Recovering the “structural” factors
to identifying the parameter θ and the rotation matrix T such that

corresponds

= ′ .

The theory imposes three types of conditions that can be used to identify θ. The first is that

(the IC

factor) is orthogonal to commodity-related shocks (DC factors). Therefore, if one had a S by 1 vector of instruments
that is correlated with the energy shocks Ξ , the orthogonality of
[

would deliver S moment conditions

] = 0. The conditions can be rewritten as
[

]=

cos +

sin

= 0.

(5)

If S = 1, then θ would be uniquely identified. If S > 1, then θ is overidentified, and one could estimate it using
standard generalized method of moments GMM methods by writing the moment conditions as
( )= [
where

is a weighting matrix, such that

=

]

[

]

( ). Letting

(6)
be the inverse of the variance-covariance

matrix associated with the moment conditions, standard GMM asymptotic results apply, including standard errors
for θ and tests of the over-identifying conditions for N and T large enough for the factors to be considered as observed
variables rather than generated (e.g., Stock and Watson 2002; and Bai and Ng 2002).
A second approach would be to make use of the theoretical prediction that

is a linear combination of

exogenous variables that have only indirect effects on the commodity sector such as the productivity shocks or labor
supply shocks considered in the model. If one had a S by 1 vector of instruments

for each period correlated with

one or more of these exogenous drivers, then another set of orthogonality conditions imposed by the theory would
10

be [

] = 0. As in the previous case, one could estimate θ using GMM, given these orthogonality conditions,

and test over-identifying restrictions if S > 1.
In both of these cases, the econometrician must take a stand on whether the chosen instruments should be
correlated with commodity-related shocks or with

. While economic theory may provide clear guidance in some

cases, this choice may be problematic when one is interested in whether an exogenous variable affects commodities
only through general-equilibrium effects or more directly. Within our framework, this question amounts to whether
the exogenous variable should be considered part of

or one of the commodity-related shocks. For example, in

the case of commodity prices, monetary policy shocks could potentially have direct effects on commodity markets
in the presence of storage motives but would otherwise not be expected to have direct effects on commodity markets
if the speculative channel is absent or sufficiently small, as discussed in Appendix I.
A third approach is to make use of sign restrictions on the loadings. The theory predicts that the loadings on
must all be positive (since

> 0 ∀ in equation (4)). Letting be the N by 2 matrix of unrotated factor loadings,

the rotated or “structural” loadings are
) are then

=

cos +

=

=[

] . The loadings on the first rotated factor (corresponding to

sin . Imposing that all of the elements of

to identifying the range of values of θ such that min

cos +

sin

be positive would therefore correspond
> 0. In general, this leads only to a set of

admissible values of θ and associated rotation matrices without uniquely identifying the rotation matrix. This
approach is conceptually similar to the set identification of VARs by sign restrictions (Uhlig 2002).
In short, the theoretical model of commodity prices yields not only a factor structure for commodity prices
but also a set of conditions that can be used to identify (or, in the case of sign restrictions, limit the set of) the rotation
matrix necessary to recover the underlying factors. Furthermore, the factors have economic interpretations. The IC
factor corresponds to the level of production and income net of commodity-related shocks, while other factors
correspond to one or more of these commodity-related shocks. The identification of the rotation matrix, and thus the
underlying economic factors, follows from orthogonality conditions implied by the model, as well as sign restrictions
on the loadings predicted by the theory. The implied factor structure of the model combined with the ability to
recover an economic interpretation of the factors thus provides a new method for separating fluctuations in aggregate
output into those driven by commodity-related shocks and those driven by non-commodity-related shocks.

The Sources of Commodity Price Comovement: Empirical Evidence

In this section, we implement the factor decomposition of real commodity prices suggested by the theory. We first
construct a historical cross-section of real commodity prices for the commodities that conform to the theoretical
structure of the model along several dimensions. We then implement a factor decomposition and identify the factors
suggested by the theory. After considering a wide range of robustness checks, we argue that commodity-related
shocks have contributed only modestly to fluctuations in global economic activity.
3.1

Data
11

Guided by the theoretical model, we use four criteria to decide which commodities to include in the data set and
which to exclude. First, commodities must not be vertically integrated.8 Second, the main use of commodities must
be directly related to the aggregate consumption bundle, and they should not be primarily used for the purposes of
financial speculation.9 Third, commodities must not be jointly produced.10 Finally, the pricing of commodities must
be determined freely in spot markets and must not display the price stickiness associated with the existence of longterm contractual agreements.11
Applying these criteria leaves us with 40 commodities in the sample. It includes 22 commodities that we
refer to as agricultural or food commodities, five food oils, and 13 industrial commodities (see Appendix C for a
detailed list). We compiled monthly data from January 1957 to January 2013 (as available) from a number of sources,
including the CRB Commodity Yearbooks, the CRB InfoTech CD, the World Bank GEM Commodity Price Data,
the IMF’s Commodity Price Indices and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While most of the data are consistently
available from January 1968 until January 2013, in some cases, there are a number of missing observations in the
underlying data, as well as periods when we treat the available data as missing because spot trading was limited.
Appendix C provides details on the construction of each series, their availability and any periods over which we treat
the data as missing because of infrequent price changes. Furthermore, while we can construct price data going back
to at least 1957 for many commodities, we restrict the empirical analysis to the period since 1968, in light of the
numerous price regulations and government price support mechanisms in place during the earlier period. 12
3.2

Common Factors in Commodity Prices

Before conducting the factor analysis, we normalize each price series by the U.S. CPI, take logs of all series and
normalize each series by its standard deviation. Because there are missing observations in the data, we use the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm of Stock and Watson (2002).13 We follow Kilian (2009) in focusing on
8

Vertically integrated commodities would introduce the possibility of price comovement resulting from idiosyncratic shocks
to one commodity affecting prices in other commodities through the supply chain. For example, an exogenous shock to the
production of sorghum would affect the price of non-grass-fed beef because sorghum is primarily used as feed. Thus, this
shock could ultimately affect the price of milk and hides as well.
9
Some commodities, such as precious metals, have long been recognized as behaving more like financial assets than normal
commodities (Chinn and Coibion 2014). Thus, we exclude gold, silver, platinum and palladium from the cross-section of
commodities.
10
Some commodities are derivative products of the production of other commodities. This is particularly the case for minerals,
which are commonly recovered during the mining for metal commodities, making the assumption of orthogonal productivity
shocks clearly inapplicable. We drop any such commodities.
11
While many commodities have long been traded on liquid international spot markets, this is not always the case. For example,
the price measure of tung oil tracked by the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Commodity Yearbooks varies little over time
and is often fixed for periods lasting as long as one year. Because we want to focus on commodities whose prices reflect
contemporaneous economic conditions, we exclude commodities such as tung oil that systematically display long periods of
price invariance. For some commodities in the sample, prices were not determined in flexible markets until much later than
others; for these commodities, we treat early price data as missing values. For mercury, the reverse is true, since its use has
declined over time and its price began to display long periods with no price changes starting in 1995. We treat its prices after
March 1995 as missing. Appendix B provides more details on these adjustments.
12
Appendix D provides detail on the geographic variation in where commodities are produced and how they are used.
13
Specifically, we first demean each series and replace missing values with zeroes before recovering the first K factors. We use
these K factors to impute the value of missing observations, and then do the factor analysis again, iterating on this procedure

12

the (log) level of real commodity prices but document in our robustness checks that our results are qualitatively
unchanged if we take the first difference of real commodity prices or use linearly detrended series.
We consider several metrics to characterize the contribution of the first five factors in accounting for
commodity price movements, summarized in Table 1.14 The first row presents the sum of eigenvalues associated
with each number of factors normalized by the sum across all eigenvalues, a simple measure of variance explained
by common factors. In addition, we present additional metrics based on R2s that explicitly take into account missing
values associated with some commodities: the average across the individual R2s computed for each commodity, the
median across these same commodity-specific R2s, the R2 constructed across all commodities. The key result from
this table is that the first common factor explains a large share of the price variation across commodities, ranging
from 60% to 70% depending on the specific measure used. In contrast, all of the additional factors explain smaller
percentages of the variance in commodity prices. The second factor, for example, accounts for between 6% and 10%,
while the third factor contributes another 5% of the variance. Thus, the first two factors jointly account for
approximately 70–75% of the variance in commodity prices.15
The ability of the first two factors, and the first common factor in particular, to account for so much of the
variance holds across commodity groups. Table 1 includes the contribution of different factors to explaining the
variance across the three subsets of commodities in the sample—agricultural/food, oils and industrials. Differences
across subsets of commodities are quite small: the contribution of the first factor ranges from 55% (pooled R2 across
all commodities in this subset) for industrial commodities to 64% for agricultural/food commodities and 72% for
oils (see Appendix E for commodity-specific results). The decomposition does not suggest that one needs different
factors for different types of commodities. This point is worth stressing because a common concern with factor
analysis is that different factors are needed to explain different subsets of the data. As illustrated in Table 1, this is
not the case for our data.
3.3

Identification of the Rotation Matrix and the Underlying Economic Factors

To implement a structural interpretation of the factors as suggested by the model, we interpret the results of Table 1
as indicating that a two-factor representation adequately characterizes the data. First, additional factors beyond the
first two add relatively little in explanatory power and can be omitted. Second, under the null of the model, it is a
priori unlikely for there to be fewer than two factors. Indeed, such a finding would imply that there are no shocks
that directly affect commodity prices and that all movements in commodity prices reflect either the level of aggregate
economic activity or idiosyncratic commodity factors. We can rule this argument out immediately because there

until convergence. We use K = 5 factors for the imputation; however, the results are not sensitive to the specific number of
factors used.
14
Following Connor and Korajczyk (1993) and Bai and Ng (2002), we use principal components on the variance-covariance
matrix of commodity prices to estimate the approximate factors.
15
Statistical tests of the number of factors point toward parsimonious factor specifications. For example, the PC2 and IC2
criteria of Bai and Ng (2002) each select one factor. The same result is obtained using the test suggested by Onatski (2010) or
the two criteria proposed in Ahn and Horenstein (2013).

13

exists at least one common shock to the supply of commodities: exogenous energy price movements. Because
commodities require energy in production and distribution, exogenous shocks to energy prices necessarily induce
some comovement in commodity prices, as commodities are produced in different parts of the world but consumption
occurs disproportionately in advanced economies, thereby generating significant shipping and distribution costs.
To estimate the rotation matrix, our baseline is to impose orthogonality conditions on the indirect common
factor

. Specifically, we take

, the measure of OPEC production shocks from Bastianin and Manera’s (2014)

updated version of the Kilian (2008) series and define the orthogonality conditions as
1

…

[

production shock series as well as L lags of the shock. The IC factor

there are more moment conditions (L + 2) than parameters (θ), we can estimate the rotation parameter θ using GMM
by minimizing ( ):
( )=

∑(

∑(

(7)

We set L = 36 months for the baseline estimation to capture the fact that the OPEC production shocks have
long-lived effects on commodity prices, although the results are robust to both shorter and longer lag specifications
as well, as we document below. W is the Newey-West (1987) heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation HAC robust
estimate of the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of moment conditions. We iterate over minimizing ( )
and then computing the implied weighting matrix until the estimate of θ has converged (W = I in the first step). Table
2 presents the resulting estimate of θ and its associated standard error. With

= −0.10 and a standard error of 0.31,

we cannot reject the null hypothesis that θ = 0. From this estimate of θ, we construct estimates of the rotation
parameters

and

:

is close to 1, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that

= 0, so the estimated

rotation matrix is not statistically different from the identity matrix. Furthermore, the over-identification conditions
cannot be rejected.
The reason why the estimated rotation matrix is close to the identity matrix is that, while the first unrotated
factor is largely uncorrelated with OPEC production shocks, this condition is not satisfied for the second unrotated
factor, which responds strongly to OPEC production shocks. Because the unrotated factors are already largely
consistent with the theoretically predicted orthogonality conditions (namely, that the first factor is orthogonal to
commodity shocks, but the second is not), the estimation procedure yields only a slight rotation of the original factors.
While the fact that we cannot reject the over-identifying conditions is consistent with the theory, we can
further assess the extent to which the estimated rotation satisfies the theoretical predictions of the model. For
example, an additional theoretical prediction is that the loadings on the indirect factor will all be the same sign. To
assess this prediction, we present in Table 3 the estimated factor loadings for each rotated factor. The loadings on
the IC factor are positive for all commodities, as predicted by the theory. In contrast, the loadings on the commodity14

related factor are of mixed signs. There are no systematic patterns across commodity groups, again confirming that
the factors explaining commodity prices are common across commodity subsets. Without imposing any restrictions
on the loadings as part of the identification strategy for the rotation matrix, we find that the estimated rotation satisfies
theoretical predictions on the factor loadings and those implied by the over-identifying restrictions.16
Given the estimate of θ and the rotation matrix, we construct the rotated factor

that, according to the

model, corresponds to the level of aggregate output and income that would have occurred in the absence of
commodity-related shocks. This factor is presented in Figure 2, after being detrended with a Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter with λ = 129,600, the typical value for monthly data, to highlight variation at business cycle frequencies. In
addition, we draw from the estimated distribution of θ, construct

for each new draw and use this distribution to

characterize the 99% confidence interval of the HP-filtered factor.
This factor displays a sharp rise in 1973–74 before falling sharply during the 1974–75 recession in the United
States. This drop is followed by a progressive increase over the course of the mid- to late 1970s, with the factor
peaking in 1979 before falling sharply during each of the “twin” recessions of 1980–82, and then rebounding sharply
after the end of the Volcker disinflation. Thus, over the course of the 1970s, this structural factor displays a clear
cyclical pattern. During the mid-1980s, the factor drops sharply before rebounding in the late 1980s, and then falls
gradually through the 1990–91 U.S. recession before rebounding through the mid-1990s. It experiences a large
decline in the late 1990s, before the 2000–01 U.S. recession and then rebounds shortly thereafter. After a brief decline
in the mid-2000s, the factor displays a sharp increase from 2005 to 2008, the period when many commodity prices
boomed, and then falls sharply in late 2008 and 2009 before rebounding strongly in 2010. In short, there is a clear
procylical pattern to the IC factor relative to U.S. economic conditions.
3.4

Robustness of the Estimation

To assess the sensitivity of our results, we vary some of the specific choices made for the estimation of θ. For
example, we report in Table 2 results from using fewer moment conditions (L = 12 and 24 months) as well as more
moment conditions (L = 48 months). Neither changes the estimates significantly. Similarly, we repeat the GMM
estimates using a two-step procedure, in which θ is first estimated using a weighting matrix equal to the identity
matrix with no subsequent iterations after updating the weighting matrix, and second using a continuously updated
GMM in which we minimize over θ and W jointly until convergence. In both cases, the results are qualitatively

16

The model developed in section 2 also predicts that commodities that are more energy intensive in production have larger
(in absolute value) loadings on the DC factor. Using the 2007 benchmark input-output tables to characterize energy intensity
of production for 13 commodity groupings (which jointly include 34 of the commodities in our cross-section), we find a
positive relationship between the loadings and the energy intensity of production. These results are reported in Appendix K.
This suggestive evidence is consistent with the model’s predictions and lends credibility to the framework we use to
characterize the common variation in commodity prices. Unfortunately, the input tables are not sufficiently detailed to allow
us to test this prediction for a more differentiated set of commodities.

15

similar. Finally, because non-linear GMM can be sensitive to normalizations, we replicate the baseline estimation
after rewriting moment conditions as

(

+

)

= 0, and the results are again unchanged.17

A more interesting robustness check is to consider the alternative identification strategy suggested in section
2.4, namely to exploit the theoretical predictions for signs of factor loadings: loadings on the IC factor should all be
positive. Thus, one can characterize the set of admissible rotation matrices by restricting them to be consistent with
the sign restrictions implied by the theory, in the spirit of Uhlig (2002). In our case, this procedure consists of
identifying the set of θ such that min

cos +

sin

> 0, where

for i = {1, 2} are the loading vectors

associated with the unrotated factors and min is with respect to the elements of

. We consider values of

∈ [− , ]

(at increments of 0.001) and, for each θ, determine whether the restriction is satisfied. This yields a set of admissible
rotation matrices and therefore a set of possible IC factors. We apply the HP filter to each of these and plot the
resulting minimum and maximum values for each month in Panel B of Figure 2, along with the 99% confidence
interval for the rotated IC factor from the baseline GMM estimation. There is significant overlap between the two
approaches, with the minimum and maximum values from the sign restriction typically being within the 99%
confidence interval of the GMM-estimated IC factor. Thus, despite the fact that the two identification strategies are
quite different, they point toward a remarkably consistent characterization of the non-commodity-related structural
factor.
In Appendix F, we provide a number of additional robustness checks on these results. For example, we
replicate our results dropping either all commodities whose primary use is as food or as feed, or those commodities
disproportionately produced in the U.S.S.R., China or India through much of the sample. We verify that our results
are robust to alternative assumptions about stationarity and find similar results using first differences or linearly
detrended real commodity prices (Appendix G). We also find little sensitivity to dropping commodities for which
imputation was needed or to decomposing the correlation matrix rather than the covariance matrix for the factor
analysis.
3.4

Factor Contributions to Commodity Prices, Comovement and Global Real Activity

We now turn to using the factor structure to better understand the historical sources of commodity price movements
and global real activity. For prices, we decompose the average annual percentage change in commodity prices into
the components driven by indirect and direct common factors. The decomposition follows directly from the rotated
factor structure, yielding
−

=

−

+

−

+(

−

)

where the bar denotes averages across all commodities in the cross-section. The first term on the right-hand side of
the equation represents the contribution of the IC factor to average commodity price changes, the second represents

17

While we rely on standard asymptotics which apply for large N and T, adjusting standard errors to account for smaller N
would only strengthen the main result that one cannot reject the null that the estimated rotation matrix is not different from the
identity matrix.

16

the contribution of the DC factor, and the third reflects average idiosyncratic effects. The results of this
decomposition are presented in the top panel of Figure 3, in which we plot the contributions from the IC and DC
factors each month as well as the actual annual average price change across commodities. The IC factor, which
captures the endogenous response of prices to non-commodity shocks, explains the vast majority of historical
commodity price changes. To the extent that income effects on inputs into the production of commodities are likely
weak, the IC factor can be interpreted as primarily reflecting changing demand for commodities due to changes in
global economic activity. During the commodity boom of 1973–74, for example, indirect shocks to commodity
markets accounted for almost all of the rise in commodity prices, with the remainder reflecting direct commodityrelated shocks. Every other historical episode of large changes in average commodity prices is also accounted for by
the indirect factor, i.e., as an endogenous response of commodity prices to global business cycle conditions not driven
by commodity-related shocks.
We can also quantify how changes in each factor have contributed to the time variation in comovement
among commodity prices. Specifically, we can decompose, each month, annual changes in real commodity prices as
follows:
( )−

( )=

−

+

−

+

−

From this, we can construct each month the cross-sectional R2 coming from both factors (i.e., the ability of changes
in both factors to explain commodity price movements through common forces) as well as the partial R2 coming
from the IC factor. These series are plotted in Panel B of Figure 3. There is significant variation over time in the
overall comovement of commodity prices, as captured by both factors, with the highest degrees of comovement in
commodity prices occurring between 1973 and 1975, in the early to mid-1980s, in the late 1990s, and in the mid- to
late 2000s continuing to 2013. The time variation in comovement is again primarily explained by changes in the
indirect factor. Periods in which commodity prices co-move most strongly have also been periods in which
commodity price changes have been driven by the endogenous response of commodity prices to non-commodity
shocks.
We now assess the contribution of each factor to global economic activity, using the global industrial
production (IP) constructed by Baumeister and Peersman (2011) from 1947Q1 until 2010Q4.
Unlike with commodity prices, the factor structure does not immediately lend itself to a decomposition of historical
changes in global industrial production. To do so, we first rely on the theory presented in section 2 in which the IC
factor corresponds to the level of global activity that would have occurred in the absence of direct commodity shocks
(

). Because the scale of the IC factor is not identified, we normalize it such that the standard deviation of quarterly

changes in the IC is equal to the standard deviation of quarterly percent changes in global IP and treat the resulting
historical changes in the IC as the contribution of indirect shocks to global IP. The difference between the demeaned
quarterly growth rate of global IP and the demeaned change in the IC (defined as

≡

−

) should reflect

the contribution of direct commodity shocks, potentially omitted factors, and mismeasurement in global production
levels. To evaluate the contribution of direct commodity shocks to global IP, we regress
17

on 4 lags of itself and 8

lags of the direct commodity factor (

) at a quarterly frequency and construct the contribution of the DC factor to

global IP net of the contribution of the IC factor. This approach leaves a component of global activity unaccounted
for, potentially reflecting measurement error, omitted variables or model misspecification.
We plot the resulting contributions of the IC and DC factors to global IP growth in Panel C of Figure 3,
again showing only the annual changes to filter out the high-frequency variation in the measurement of global IP.
The correlation between the IC factor and global IP is high (0.59) so that historical changes in global IP are primarily
attributed to indirect non-commodity shocks. This is particularly true from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s,
although commodity-related shocks deepened the decline in global IP during late 1974 and early 1975. As was the
case with the decomposition of commodity prices, the decline in economic activity during the Volcker disinflation
is accounted for by the IC factor. The dynamics of global activity from the late 1980s to mid-1990s are also largely
attributed to the IC factor, although actual changes in global IP exceeded those predicted by the two factors. Growth
in the IC factor during the 2000s also coincides with the growth in global IP during this time period, while
commodity-related shocks in the DC contributed modest downward pressure on economic activity in 2002 and 2003,
then again in 2007–10. To the extent that the DC factor reflects exogenous energy price fluctuations, the negative
contribution of the DC factor from late 2007 through 2010 (subtracting 1–2% from the annual growth rate of global
IP) is broadly consistent with Hamilton (2009), who argues that oil price shocks contributed to the severity of the
Great Recession of 2007–09. Nonetheless, most of the decline in the growth rate of global IP from late 2007 to the
depth of the recession can be attributed to declines in the IC factor.
4

Forecasting Applications

We examine whether the IC factor contains real-time information relevant for predicting commodity prices, broad
commodity price indices and the price of oil in a recursive out-of-sample forecasting exercise. The forecasting model
is a monthly linear bivariate FAVAR(p) model for the real price of commodity j and the IC factor.18 The lag length
p is chosen recursively using the BIC. We assess the ability of the IC factor to forecast the 40 individual real
commodity prices used to compute the IC factor, three widely used real commodity price indices—the CRB spot
index, the World Bank non-energy index and the IMF non-fuel index – and the real price of oil.19 The forecast
performance of the FAVAR is evaluated over two periods. One is commodity-specific and begins either in January
1968 or at the earliest possible date subject to the condition that the initial estimation window contains at least 48
observations. The second one begins in January 1984 and ends in December 2012, with the initial estimation window
ending in December 1983. We evaluate the recursive mean-squared prediction error (MSPE) of the FAVAR-based

18

Because we are unable to reject the null that the rotation matrix equals the identity matrix in section 3, we use the unrotated
first factor in the forecasting exercises.
19
The IMF non-fuel commodity price index begins in February 1980. The price index was backcast to January 1957 using the
IMF agricultural raw material, beverage, food and metals sub-indices with weights obtained from regressing the non-fuel index
on the individual sub-indices. The real price of oil is the U.S. refiner’s acquisition cost of imported oil. All variables are deflated
by U.S. CPI. We apply the EM algorithm recursively to fill in the missing observations.

forecast at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month horizons. All forecast accuracy comparisons are conducted relative to the nochange benchmark. Multiple step-ahead forecasts are computed iteratively using the FAVAR.
Table 4 summarizes the results obtained from the forecasting exercise for the commodity-specific and
common sample periods. A summary measure across all commodities is given by the

For both the commodity-specific and the common forecast evaluation periods, forecasts based on a common
factor generate improvements in forecast accuracy between 2% and 8% relative to the no-change forecast up to the
6-month horizon. The FAVAR-based forecasts improve on the no-change forecast for most commodities at shorthorizons but performance deteriorates over longer horizons.20 The FAVAR does best at predicting the World Bank
non-energy index and the IMF non-fuel index, with improvements in forecast accuracy up to 17% over short
horizons. It also delivers significant improvements relative to the random walk at predicting real oil prices at short
horizons.21
These findings show that the prices of internationally traded commodities are forecastable in a way suggested
by the model presented in section 2. Improvements in forecast accuracy can be economically important at short
horizons, and agricultural commodities and oils tend to be more predictable than industrial commodities. Thus, the
factor structure in commodity prices serves a dual purpose for policy-makers and practitioners: it both provides a
structural decomposition of the forces driving commodity prices and helps forecast commodity price fluctuations.
5

Conclusion

We propose a new empirical strategy, grounded in a microfounded business cycle model with commodities, to
identify the driving forces of global economic activity and commodity prices. The model provides a set of
orthogonality conditions and sign restrictions that can be used to identify the parameters of the rotation matrix that
yield a structural interpretation of the common factors behind commodity prices, with the “indirect” factor
representing the counterfactual level of global economic activity that would have occurred without direct shocks to
commodity markets. The IC factor we identify accounts for about 60–70% of the variance in commodity prices, and
we cannot reject the theoretical restrictions implied by the model. Its behavior during the 1970s and 1980s suggests
that the macroeconomic fluctuations observed during that era were not driven primarily by commodity-related
20

Appendix J provides commodity-specific results. FAVAR-based forecasts generate improvements in forecast accuracy for
some agricultural commodities and oils up to 12 months ahead. For the common sample period, 10 (out of 15) of the agricultural
commodities and 2 (out of 3) oils achieve improvements in forecast accuracy at the 12-month horizon. The improvements in
forecast accuracy in the industrial commodities are concentrated at shorter horizons (i.e., 1- and 3-months).
21
Additional results on the ability of the commodity price factor to forecast the real price of oil are in Appendix Table J.3. It
compares the bivariate FAVAR with a VAR model of the global oil market that performs well at forecasting the real price of oil
out of sample (Baumeister and Kilian 2012; Alquist et al. 2013). The FAVAR model based on the IC factor does well relative
to the oil market VAR model at the 1- and 3-month horizons when the BIC is used but it is dominated by the VAR model when
a fixed lag length of 12 is used, although the IC factor model still delivers improvements in forecast accuracy up to about 14%
relative to the no-change forecast.

19

shocks. Nevertheless, there are episodes during which the direct commodity shocks contributed negatively to global
economic activity, particularly in the early 1990s and during the Great Recession.
The IC factor can also be used to forecast real commodity prices, some commonly used commodity price
indices and the real price of crude oil with a bivariate FAVAR in real-time. Because our identification strategy relies
only on commodity prices themselves, it can be implemented for commodities for which market fundamentals are
unavailable in real time. In sum, we provide a new conceptual framework for identifying the sources and implications
of commodity price comovement and its relationship to global macroeconomic conditions.

Notes: The table presents nonlinear GMM estimates of parameter θ from equation (7) in the text, along with NeweyWest (1987) standard errors (se(θ)), the p-value for over-identifying restrictions (p(over-id)), and the number of
observations used in the estimation (N). The panel on the right presents the implied parameters of the first row of the
rotation matrix, along with the 95% confidence interval implied from the estimated distribution of θ. The baseline
estimates are based on iterative GMM until convergence, using a constant as well as the contemporaneous value and
36 lags of OPEC production shocks for moment conditions. Subsequent rows present robustness to using more or
fewer lags of OPEC production shocks as moment conditions, a two-step GMM procedure, a continuously updated
GMM procedure and an alternative normalization of moment conditions. See section 3.3 for details.

Notes: For the commodity-specific forecast evaluation period, the initial estimation window depends on the commodity. It begins either in January 1968 or
at the earliest date that allows the initial estimation window to contain at least 48 observations. The maximum length of the recursive sample is restricted by
the end of the data sample for each commodity and the forecast horizon. The “Aggregate MSPE Ratio” is the ratio of the sum of the MSPEs for the
bivariate FAVAR forecasts of the real commodity prices relative to the sum of the MSPEs for the no-change forecast. The MSPE ratios of the individual
forecasts of real commodity prices are also computed relative to the benchmark no-change forecast. For the FAVAR-based forecasts, the lag length is
chosen recursively using the BIC. The number of commodities included in the commodity price indices but not in the cross-section of 40 commodities used
to extract the factor is in parentheses.

Primary Commodity-Production Sector

There are a continuum of primary commodity producing firms. The energy good is used in the
production of the primary commodity (Qt (j)), with a decreasing returns to scale (determined by
αj ) production function
Qt (j) = At (j)Σt (j)1−αj
where At (j) is the productivity shock. Let Pt (j) be the price of the commodity j. Then the firm’s
problem is to maximize profits

notation with lower case variables denoting log deviations of real variables (except forΣt (j) and
Σt , which are deviations from steady-state) and variables without a t subscript to denote steadystate values of respective variables. We normalize, without loss of generality, equal production in
steady-state across commodity producers. The log-linear equilibrium is determined by

production function and substitution of the energy good input, the following
yt (j) = at (j) +

Next, we can write out the demand curve for commodity j from the relative demand equation

Given the endogenous determination of Σt however, we need to do further manipulations to

where Ct is consumption and the household supplies labor to the final good (Nts ) and the energy

where Pt is aggregate price, Bt is nominal bond holdings with Rt−1 the interest rate, Wt the wage
in the final good sector, Wte the wage in the energy sector and Tt lump-sum profits from firms.

Primary Commodity-Production Sector

There are two types of “commodity sectors/goods”, say agriculture and industrial, denoted by k.
Here, k = ag, ind. There are a continuum of primary commodity producing firms in each sector.
The energy good is used in the production of the primary commodity (Qkt (j)), with a decreasing
returns to scale (determined by αk,j ) production function
Qkt (j) = Akt (j)Σkt (j)1−αk,j
where Akt (j) is the productivity shock. Let Ptk (j) be the price of the commodity j in sector k. Then
the firm’s problem is to maximize profits
Ptk (j)Akt (j)Σkt (j)1−αk,j − St Σkt (j)
while taking productivity and prices as given. The first-order condition can be written in real terms
as

We now consider a first-order approximation around a non-stochastic steady-state. We use the
notation with lower case variables denoting log deviations of real variables (except forΣkt (j) and
Σt , which are deviations from steady-state) and variables without a t subscript to denote steadystate values of respective variables. We normalize, without loss of generality, equal production in
steady-state across commodity producers. The log-linear equilibrium is determined by

99% CI for "No First-Order Speculation" Commodities

Notes: The figure presents the baseline 99% confidence interval of the (HP-filtered) IC factor from the factor analysis
on the full cross-section of commodities in section 3.3 using the estimated rotation parameters from GMM estimates
(grey shaded area). The blue lines correspond to the 99% confidence interval for the equivalent factor using only those
commodities for which we cannot reject the null of no first-order speculative price effects in Table 4. Confidence
intervals are 3-month moving averages. See section 4 for details.

Appendix I: Storage
The model in section 2 yields a factor structure of commodity prices whose properties conform closely to
the data and permit us to make causal inferences about the relationship between global real activity and
commodity-related shocks. The key to the identification in the factor structure is that all indirect shocks to
commodity markets (i.e., all shocks that affect commodity prices through the general-equilibrium response
of output) are aggregated into a single factor, the IC factor. This conclusion relies on the premise that all
indirect shocks induce identical comovement in commodity prices.
This aggregation property of the factor structure can be broken in the presence of storage. To see
why, suppose that we extend the model to include a perfectly competitive storage sector for each primary
commodity j that purchases or sells that commodity on the spot market, leading it to hold inventories in the
steady state. As illustrated in Deaton and Laroque (1992), the key determinant of whether the storage sector
increases or decreases its inventories is the expected path of prices of the commodity. If a current increase
in prices is not expected to persist, then the storage sector sells a positive amount of its inventories on the
spot market today when prices are high and rebuilds inventories in future periods when prices are lower.
This behavior increases the current supply of the good and reduces it in the future. In contrast, if the shock
is expected to generate a persistent increase in prices, the storage sector does not have an incentive to change
its stock of inventories and therefore is not a net purchaser of the good. Thus, the persistence of the driving
process affects the size of net purchases by the storage sector through its effect on the path of expected
prices. For example, if aggregate productivity shocks in the model were highly persistent while labor supply
shocks were less persistent, the presence of storage would lead these shocks to have different supply
responses, depending on the size of the storage sector’s net purchases. The comovement in commodity
prices would then not necessarily be the same across the two shocks, potentially breaking the aggregation
result.
In practice, this issue is unlikely to be quantitatively important for three reasons. First, if the
aggregation of indirect shocks into a single IC factor were broken, we would expect a factor decomposition
of commodity prices to indicate that many factors were required to explain the comovement of commodity
prices, since a number of different aggregate structural shocks are likely affecting commodity prices
through the indirect channel of global activity, such as financial shocks, markup shocks and fiscal shocks,
in addition to the productivity and labor supply shocks that we explicitly model. But, as documented in
Table 1, the comovement of commodity prices is well-characterized by two factors, with any additional
factors adding little explanatory power. This finding suggests that either different indirect shocks have
common effects on expected price paths of commodity prices (such that the response of the storage sector

is similar across all indirect shocks and, therefore, that the aggregation of indirect shocks still holds) or the
effects of net purchases for the storage motive are second-order in affecting commodity prices.
The second reason why storage is unlikely to be important is precisely because the effects of net
purchases for storage motives appear to be second-order for most commodities. To examine this claim,
suppose again that we integrated a storage sector for each primary commodity into the model, in which
firms purchase or sell the commodity on the spot market as well as store it. The storage sector would
therefore affect spot markets through its forward-looking net purchases, defined as 𝑁𝑃 (𝑗) at time t for
commodity j. The market-clearing condition in the presence of an additional storage sector would then be
given by 𝑄 (𝑗) = 𝑌 (𝑗) + 𝑁𝑃 (𝑗) such that high (low) net purchases by the storage sector to accumulate
(draw down) inventories would increase (decrease) the demand for commodity j at time t, holding all else
constant. Allowing for trend growth in production such that Y/Q and NP/Q are stationary along the balanced
growth path, the log-linearized version of this equation is
(𝑌/𝑄 − 1)𝑛𝑝 (𝑗) = (𝑌/𝑄)𝑦 (𝑗)
where the terms in parentheses are balanced growth path ratios. For the storage sector to have first-order
effects on equilibrium outcomes (including prices), it must be the case that net purchases are different from
zero on average, or equivalently that the ratio of consumption to production (Y/Q) of the commodity is
different from one.
Table I.1 presents estimates of the mean annual ratio of consumption to production (minus 1) for
commodities for which such data could be collected: 𝑟 = 𝑌 /𝑄 − 1.1 Out of 32 commodities, we reject
the null hypothesis that 𝑟 = 0 on average for only nine: apples, bananas, onions, potatoes, rice, sugar, tea,
palm oil and safflower oil. Four of these are highly perishable commodities (apples, bananas, onions and
potatoes), thus one would expect some fraction of the goods to spoil while being transported from
production to retail facilities. But even in the case of these highly perishable goods, the implied gaps
between consumption and production are small—less than 1% per year. Furthermore, in the case of
potatoes, the rejection of the null has the wrong sign (i.e., consumption is larger than production on
average). Among the less perishable agricultural commodities (e.g., grains), there is little evidence that
consumption is significantly less than production, on average, with most of the point estimates being less

1

We use measures of consumption and production of commodities from the CRB. When these are not available, we
rely on measures from the UN FAO for agricultural and oil commodities, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
Food and Agricultural Services (USDA FAS), and from trade associations. Aluminum data were provided to us by
the European Aluminum Association (EAA), data for copper are from the International Copper Study Group
(ICSG), data for tin were provided by the International Tin Research Institute (ITRI), nickel data are from
International Nickel Study Group (INSG), while data for zinc and lead were tabulated from the International Lead
and Zinc Study Group’s Monthly Bulletin. For many commodities, we were able to construct global production and
consumption data going back to 1968. There are only eight commodities for which we could not compile
consumption and production data: beef, hay, orange juice, shrimp, cement, lumber, mercury and wool.

than 1%. This conclusion also applies to industrial commodities, which are highly storable and for which
one would expect inventory motives to be potentially important. In fact, there is little evidence of non-zero
net purchases by the storage sector. Thus, with the exception of a few commodities, it is difficult to reject
the null that speculative motives through storage have only second-order effects on prices. 2 Furthermore,
the failure to reject the null does not typically reflect large standard errors. Rather, the point estimates of
the net ratio are typically smaller than 1%, which suggests that net flows to the storage sector are small on
average. Finally, if we replicate our baseline factor analysis using only the commodities for which we
cannot reject the null of zero net purchases on average, there is little effect on the estimated IC factor
(Appendix H).
A third way to assess the possibility that the effects of storage could break the aggregation of
indirect commodities into a common IC factor is to note that, in the presence of storage motives, interest
rates would play an important role in affecting commodity prices (Deaton and Laroque 1992; and Frankel
2008). As a result, the logic of the model in section 2 would imply that monetary policy shocks would
directly affect commodity prices through changes in desired inventories. Therefore, in a factor
decomposition, these monetary policy shocks would not be incorporated into the indirect factor. Hence, a
testable implication of a quantitatively important storage motive is that monetary policy shocks should not
affect the IC factor.
To test this prediction, we identify U.S. monetary policy shocks using a time-varying-coefficients
(TVC) Taylor rule

,

𝐹 𝑔𝑦 + 𝜑 𝐹 𝑥 + 𝜌 𝑖

in which the central bank responds to real-time forecasts (𝐹 ) of average inflation over the next two quarters
(𝜋

,

), the current quarter’s output growth (𝑔𝑦 ), the current quarter’s output gap (𝑥 ), and the previous

period’s interest rate, as in Kozicki and Tinsley (2009) and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011). We assume
that each of the TVCs follows a random walk, including the intercept that captures changes in the central
bank’s target levels of macroeconomic variables and the natural rate of interest. Following Orphanides
(2003) and Romer and Romer (2004), we use the Greenbook forecasts prepared by the staff of the Federal
Reserve before each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to characterize the FOMC’s realtime beliefs about current and future macroeconomic conditions. The TVCs allow us to distinguish between
systematic changes in the monetary policy rule from transitory deviations captured by the residuals. We
estimate this rule using data on the frequency of FOMC meetings from March 1969 until December 2008.
Because Greenbook data are not available after 2007, we use Blue Chip Economic Indicator forecasts. The
sample ends in December 2008 when the zero lower bound on interest rates was reached. We then define
2

This evidence is also consistent with the well-documented inconsistencies between the standard storage model and
the observed data (see, among others, Ng 1996).

the residuals estimated from equation (8) as monetary policy shocks and construct a monthly time series
from the shock series.
To quantify the effects of monetary policy shocks on the indirect common factor, we use a vector
autoregressive representation of macroeconomic dynamics with four variables: our measure of monetary
policy shocks, the log of U.S. industrial production, the log of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) and
the IC factor. We order the monetary policy shock first, given that it should already incorporate the most
recent economic information obtained from the Greenbook forecasts and to allow other variables to respond
to the impact of this shock. We use data from March 1969 until December 2008 to estimate the VAR with
18 months of lags, midway between the 12-month lag specifications typical of monetary VARs and the 24month lag specification used by Romer and Romer (2004). We then plot in Figure I.1 the impulse responses
of industrial production, the CPI and the IC factor to a monetary policy innovation.
An expansionary monetary policy shock in the VAR leads to higher industrial production, with
peak effects happening one to two years after the shock. The CPI rises moderately but persistently around
six months after the shock, consistent with the delayed effect on prices of monetary policy shocks long
observed in the empirical monetary policy literature (e.g., Christiano et al. 1999). The indirect factor rises
much more rapidly, within the first three months, but does not peak until nearly two years after the shock
before gradually declining back toward zero. The responses are significantly different from zero at the 5%
level for the first 20 months and are briefly at the 1% level.3 Thus, we can statistically reject the null
hypothesis that monetary policy shocks have no effect on the IC factor. In addition, the quantitative
contribution of U.S. monetary policy shocks to the indirect factor is relatively large, accounting for much
of the sustained increase in the IC factor from late 1975 until 1980 and around two-thirds of the subsequent
decline from 1980 to 1982.

3

The reported standard errors do not account for the fact that the IC factor is a generated regressor, and they therefore
may understate the true uncertainty around the point estimates. However, there are at least two reasons to suspect that
this is not quantitatively important. First, one could also test the null that monetary policy shocks have no effect on
the IC factor by regressing it on current and lagged monetary shocks, i.e., 𝐹 = 𝑐 + ∑ 𝛽 𝜀 + 𝑣 , setting I = 36
months to account for the gradual effects of monetary policy shocks on macroeconomic variables. From this
procedure, we can reject the null hypothesis that monetary policy shocks have no effect on the IC factor (i.e., 𝛽 =
0 ∀𝑖) with a p-value of 0.019. The generated regressor issue is not binding in this case, since the IC factor is only on
the left-hand side and the null hypothesis is that the coefficients on monetary policy shocks are zero, thus asymptotic
(Newey-West) standard errors are valid (Pagan 1984). The advantage of the VAR specification is that it also purges
the monetary policy shocks of potentially remaining predictability from macroeconomic variables and is in this respect
a more conservative approach. Second, given that we cannot reject the null of the rotation matrix being equal to the
identity matrix, one can use the unrotated first common factor in the VAR in lieu of the rotated one. Since the unrotated
factor can be treated as observable following Bai and Ng (2002) and Stock and Watson (2002) for large enough crosssections and time samples, the corresponding standard errors are valid. The results from this alternative specification
are almost identical, and we can reject the null of no response at the same confidence level.

In short, while the presence of commodity storage could potentially break the aggregation of
indirect shocks into a common IC factor, there is little quantitative evidence in favor of this claim. 4 First,
the fact that the comovement in commodity prices is well characterized by a small number of factors is
difficult to reconcile with the aggregation result failing to hold. Second, for most commodities, we cannot
reject the null that storage has only second-order effects on commodity prices. And third, monetary policy
shocks have both statistically and economically significant effects on the IC factor, which suggests that the
factor decomposition is not treating them as a direct commodity-related shock, as would be the case if
speculative considerations were economically important. While storage motives are nonetheless likely to
play a role in commodity prices in periods when inventory constraints are close to binding, the results
suggest that, on average, the aggregation result from section 2 provides a succinct and adequate
characterization of the data.

4

Another reason why one might be skeptical of the quantitative importance of the storage mechanism is that recent
work examining the role of speculative shocks in oil markets has found little evidence that these have contributed in
economically significant ways to historical oil price fluctuations, either in statistical VAR models such as in Kilian
and Murphy (2014) and Kilian and Lee (2014) or in DSGE models such as in Unalmis et al. (2012). While little
evidence exists on this question for other commodities, one would expect that oil markets would be most likely to
display sensitivity to speculation, given the relative ease with which oil can be stored (both underground and in aboveground storage facilities) and the potentially large convenience yields to refineries associated with holding oil as
inventories. The fact that storage shocks are not quantitatively important does not imply that storage has no effects on
the response of prices to other shocks, but it is consistent with this result.

Notes: The figures in the top row present estimated impulse responses of U.S. industrial production, the U.S. consumer
price index, and the IC factor to a 100-basis-point expansionary monetary policy shock using the vector autoregression
(VAR) described in section 4. Confidence intervals are constructed from the distribution of impulse responses
generated by drawing 2,000 times from the estimated distribution of VAR parameters. The bottom row presents actual
values of each variable normalized by the predicted values from the VAR given initial conditions and no subsequent
shocks (solid black line), U.S. recessions (light grey shaded areas) and the estimated contribution of monetary policy
shocks to historical variation in each variable (blue areas). For the CPI, the bottom figure presents year-over-year
inflation rates.

Industrial Commodities

Notes: The forecast evaluation period depends on the commodity. It begins either in 1968:1 or at the earliest date that allows the initial
estimation window to contain at least 48 observations. The maximum length of the recursive sample is restricted by the end of the data
sample for each commodity and the forecast horizon. All forecasts are obtained from a bivariate VAR that includes the level of the real
commodity price and the first principal component extracted from the cross-section of real commodity prices. The lag length of the VAR
is chosen recursively using the BIC. The MSPE of the VAR forecast is expressed as a ratio relative to that of the no-change forecast.
Entries smaller than 1 indicate that the VAR forecast is superior to the no-change forecast and are shown in boldface.

Notes: The data for the oil market are from Baumeister and Kilian (2012) and span
the period 1973:1–2012:8. “FAVAR” refers to the bivariate factor-augmented VAR
forecasting model that includes the commodity price factor and the real price of oil.
“VAR” refers to the four-variable VAR of the oil market, as described in the text.
“BIC” indicates that the lag length is chosen recursively using the BIC. “12 lags”
indicates that the lag length is fixed at 12. The MSPE ratios of the real oil price
forecasts are computed relative to the benchmark no-change forecast. Entries smaller
than 1 indicate that the model-based forecast is superior to the no-change forecast
and are shown in boldface.

Appendix K: The Direct Common Factor Loadings and the Energy Intensity
of Production
As a check on the model, we test one of its implications for the loadings on the direct common (DC)
factor. This factor represents the composition of shocks that directly affect the commodity sector in the
model via exogenous shocks to the energy sector. A direct implication of the model is that the loadings on
the DC factor are positively correlated with the share of energy inputs used in the production of the
commodity. We computed the energy input share for several commodity producing industries using the
2007 benchmark input-output table for the United States and linked these industries to the commodities in
our sample. In the cases where several commodities are in the same industry, we use the arithmetic
average of the DC factor loadings for each commodity that belongs in that industry. This approach is
similar to the one that Lee and Ni (JME 2002) used to rank industries by oil intensity.
The first two tables show the industries used in the analysis and the mapping between the commodities in
our sample and the NAICS categories. In the first table, the direct input requirement is the amount of a
commodity that is directly or initially required to produce a dollar of the industry’s output. For example, it
takes 11.9 cents of direct energy inputs to produce one dollar in the grain farming industry. The total
requirement is the direct requirement plus the indirect requirement.
The two figures depict the positive relationship between the energy input requirements and the DC factor
loadings, which is consistent with the prediction of the model. This check provides a validation of one of
the model’s predictions about the loadings and lends credibility to the framework we use to study the
common variation in commodity prices.

Notes: The data are from 2007 benchmark input-output tables computed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index_industry_io.cfm). For the purposes of calculating the energy input requirements,
these industries are classified as energy related: Oil and gas extraction (211000); coal mining (212100); electric
power generation, transmission, and distribution (221100); natural gas distribution (221200); petroleum refineries
(324110); other petroleum and coal products manufacturing (324190); petrochemical manufacturing (325110); and
pipeline transportation (486000). The data are ranked by the direct input requirement.
