Interindustry Wage Differences and Industry Characteristics

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the extent of interindustry wage differences
for nonunion workers and finds that even after controlling for a
wide range of individual characteristics and geographic location

a substantial amount of individual wage variation can be
accounted for by industry differences.
In the
aggrergate
industry effects explain at least 6.7% of inter-personal wage
variation. At most they explain 30%.

While the importance of industry differences is clear, the
reasons for the differences are more difficult to establish.
Independent of the problems of interpreting the correlates of
industry differences, even the sign of the relation of many
variables with wages is difficult to establish when other
variables are included as controls. This conclusion is suggested
by a literature review and confirmed by an analysis of a large
number of alternative specifications of an industry wage equation
individual
data
from the CPS and industry
using
wage
characteristics from a number of recent sources. Only industry

average education and industry profitability have the same
(positive) sign in every specification and in all the studies
reviewed. Of these two only average education was nearly always
significantly related to wages. Average establishment size had a
nearly consistent positive relation.
What does emerge from the analysis is a pattern of correlations.
There appears to be one major dimension (and perhaps other less
important dimensions) along which industries differ. A principal
components analysis of an industry characteristics data set is
used to demonstrate this.
High wage industries have lower quit

rates, higher labor productivity, fewer women, more educated
workers, longer work weeks, a higher ratio of nonwage to wage
compensation, higher unionization rates, larger establishments
and firms, higher concentration ratios and are more profitable.
An analysis of a limited number of industry characteristics in
1939 yields a similar pattern.

The

implications of these results for alternative theories of

wage determination are considered.

I. introduction

It

has long been noted that there are large differences in tages across in-

dustries for workers with similar characteristics doing apparently similar jobs.

Area wage surveys invariably indicate a great deal of wage dispersion for a de-

fined job classification, such as key punch operator or order filer, within a
locality.

Slichter (1950) observes that hiring rates paid for common labor by

85 plants in Cleveland in February 1947 ranged from $.50 to $1.09 an hour. A more

recent wage survey reveals that wages for the job classification key entry operator I ranged from $160 to $480 a week in Cleveland in September 1985 (U.S. Bureau

of Labor Statistics, 1985). Dunlop (1985) notes that consideration of differences

in fringe benefits tends to expand rather than offset the wage differences ob-

served across industries in area wage comparisons.

Substantial industry wage

differentials remain even after controlling for union status and observed worker
and job characteristics.

A textbook competitive labor market model offers several explanations for
interindustry wage differentials. They can arise from systematic differences in

worker ability that are correlated with industry status or from compensating

differentials for non-pecuniary aspects of work that directly affect worker
utility. Alternatively, industry wage premiums may reflect transitory differen-

tials related to shifts in labor demand or supply across sectors and imperfect
short-run labor mobility.
In recent years, a number of alternative theories of wage determination; such

as the efficiency wage theories surveyed by Stiglitz (1984), Yellen (1984), and
Katz (1986) and the union threat model of Dickens (1986); have been proposed as

possible explanations for industry wage differentials, equilibrium involuntary
unemployment, and a wide variety of other labor market phenomena. These alternative explanations focus on potential reasons why firms may find it profitable

to pay above market clearing wages and why the importance of these factors may
differ among establishments both within and across industries.
Efficiency wage models suggest that the potential benefits to a firm of higher

wages include increased effort and reduced shirking by employees, lower turnover

costs, a higher quality workforce, and improved worker morale and better group
work norms. A basic implication of efficiency wage models is that if the conditions necessitating efficiency wage payments differ across industries, then the
optimal wage will differ among industries. This means that workers with identical

productive characteristics are paid differently depending on their industry affiliation.

These wage differences for similar workers may reflect industry

characteristics that do not directly affect the utility of workers and thus would

not require compensating differentials in a standard competitive labor market.

The payment of non-competitive wage premiums may also be related to the
presence of unions or threat of collective action by workers. Firms may find it
profitable to pay greater than competitive wages to unionized workers to prevent
strikes and maintain industrial peace.1

Determining the empirical relevance of these alternative models of wage determination is quite important since the non-competitive models generate positive
and normative implications with respect to issues such as trade, industrial policy

and unemployment insurance that can be quite different from textbook competitive
labor market models or implicit contract models.2 An understanding of the nature

of interindustry wage differentials could prove quite useful in determining the
relevance of alternative models of wage determination. Dickens and Katz (1986),
Krueger and Summers (1986), and Murphy and Topel (1986) have shown that industry
wage differentials are quite persistent over long time periods. This persistence

of the wage premiums appears to rule out transitory skill premiums as a major
factor in explaining industry wage differences. The studies by Dickens and Katz

2

and by Krueger and Summers also indicate that industry wage differentials are
quite similar across countries, across occupational groups, and for both the union

and nonunion sectors.

In this paper, we analyze the industry characteristics

associated with wage premiums.
Simple competitive labor market models suggest that industry characteristics
should only generate persistent wage differences if they affect skill requirements

and working conditions. Product market factors should not matter after control-

ling for relevant worker and job characteristics.

It is widely believed that

collectively bargained wages are set in a manner different from others, and, in

particular, that they may be related to a firm's "ability to pay." We are primarily interested in this paper in the relevance of different theories of wage
determination in the absence of explicit collective bargaining. The union threat
model predicts that the bargaining power of insider nonunion workers should enable

them to capture a part of product market rents. Efficiency wage models suggest
establishment and firm size variables may affect wages by affecting the ability
to monitor worker performance. Normative efficiency wage models (Akerlof, 1984)
postulate that ability-to-pay may affect a firm's optimal wage structure.
The plan of this paper is as follows. The importance of industry affiliation

in explaining cross-sectional wage variation for the nonunion sector as a whole,

the union sector as a whole, and for individual occupational groups is analyzed
in section II.

Previous studies of the impact of industry characteristics on

wages are reviewed in section III. The sensitivity of results in these studies
to the exact specifications chosen and the failure to adequately assess the dis-

tinct impacts of industry attributes on union wages and on wages set in the ab-

sence of collective bargaining within the existing literature motivates our
detailed analysis of the correlates of industry wage differences for both union

and nonunion workers. This empirical analysis is presented in section IV. The

3

implications of the observed relationships among industry characteristics and
wages for alternative wage determination theories is discussed in section V.

II.

The Importance of Industry Affiliation in Wage Variation
To determine the importance of industry affiliation we use analysis of

covariance.3 We begin by postulating an earnings function in which wages depend

on human capital factors, personal characteristics, location, occupation, and
industry:

(1)

logW..p+X.+Z.a+t..

where

V..

X. =

vector

of individual characteristics and locational

variables for individual i,
Z. =

vector

of mutually exclusive dummy variables indicating

industry affiliation,

= random disturbance term,
13

p is the intercept, and

and a are parameter vectors. The total proportion of

wage variation (share of total sum of squares) explained by the covariates (the
variables in X) and industry affiliation is given by the R2 of equation (1).
If the covariates and industry dummy variables were orthogonal to each other,

regressions of log earnings on the covariates alone and on the industry dummies
alone would give a unique decomposition of the contribution of each set of vari-

ables to the total explained variation. The realistic case of multicollinearity
between the covariates and industry affiliation implies there is no unique vari-

ance decomposition. A conservative approach to evaluating the importance of in-

dustry effects is to credit the industry effects only with the increase in
explanatory power arising fror adding

industry

dummies to a log wage regression

4

already including the

covaristes.

This approach attributes all common impacts on

wages of the industry fixed effects and the covariates to the covariatcs.

An

alternative upper bound on the importance of the industry effects is given by the

R2 of a log wage regression including only the industry dummies.

The analysis requires a large micro data set with information on personal
characteristics, occupation, industry, and union status.

All twelve monthly

Current Population Surveys (CPSs) from 1983 were combined to generate a sample
of individuals with these properties large enough to accurately estimate industry

effects for detailed industry categories. The sample consists of private sector,
nonagricultural employees, 16 years of age or older with complete data on industry

and occupation and on either hourly wages or normal weekly earnings and normal
hours of work per week. Average earnings per hour were computed for each individual with complete earnings data. Observations with reported wages of less than
$1.00 per hour or more than $250 an hour were assumed to be coding errors and were

deleted from the data set. Although the CPS is partially a panel data set, only
those individuals in outgoing rotation groups are asked about earnings and people

exit the sample only once a year. Thus, we can be sure that all observations
represent unique individuals. This procedure left us with a sample of 109,735
nonunion workers and 25,193 union workers.4

The basic decomposition of the sources of wage variation for the nonunion

and union samples are presented in Table 1.

The covariates include detailed

controls for individual characteristics, state dummy variables, an SMSA status
dummy variable, and dummy variables for broad occupational groups. The industry

factor measures the explanatory power of a set of three digit 1980 Census of
Population code industry dummy variables (fixed effects).5 These industry effects

account for 7 to 30 percent of the nonunion wage variation and 10 to 29 percent

of the union ag variation.6 The broad ranges arise from the large degree of

5

multicollinearity between the industry effects and the covariates.
F-statistics for the hypothesis that

the

The

industry effects are all zero once the

covariates are present in the earnings equations are 81.45 for the nonunion sample

and 23.17 for the union sample. Thus, the hypothesis that the industry effects
do not matter can be rejected at any conventional significance level.

Industry differentials appear to have a substantial impact on earnings even

when allocating the joint contribution of industry and the covariates entirely

to the covariates. An approximate measure of the impact of the portion of the

industry effects orthogonal to the covariates on earnings can be derived by
multiplying the proportion of sum of squares attributable to industry alone by
the variance of log earnings in the sample, and then taking the square root of
this quantity. This yields a conservative estimate of the standard deviation in

earnings generated by industry differentials after accounting for other
observables.7 This procedure yields a standard deviation in log wages attributable

to industry of .141 for the nonunion sample and .140 for the union sample.
A further issue relevant to assessing the importance of alternative theories

of wage determination is the extent to which the impact of industry affiliation
on wages differs across occupations.

Working conditions, skill requirements,

efficiency wage considerations, and union threat effects that may give rise to
industry wage effects for particular groups of workers are likely to differ substantially across occupational groups.

We performed separate analyses of the

sources of wage variation for each of twelve occupational groups for the nonunion
sample.8 The twelve occupational groups are managers, professionals, technicians,

supervisors, sales, clericals, service workers, craft workers, operators, trans-

port and equipment operators, semiskilled workers, and laborers. The decompositions are based on on a separate set of earnings equations for each occupational

group. Tf

industry

effects are strongly statistically significant and contribute

6

substantially to the explained variation in earnings for each group. The minimum

proportion of the variation in wages

explained

by industry effects ranges from

7.6 percent for clericals to 18.9 percent for professionals, while the maximum
proportion explained ranges from 13.2 percent for clericals to 46.1 percent for
sales workers.

III.

Previous Studies of Industry Characteristics and Wages
The evidence presented in the previous section indicates that industry wage

differentials account for a substantial share of individual wage differences.
Furthermore, Dickens and Katz (1986) find that industry wage differentials are

strongly correlated across occupations. There appears to be a pattern of wage
differentials in which all workers in some industries are highly paid relative
to similar workers in other industries. The pattern of which industries pay high

wages has been very stable over time and across countries with widely varying
methods of determining labor compensation.
What are the attributes of high paying and of low paying industries? In this

section, we present a partial survey of the large empirical literature that has
attempted to answer this question by relating workers' wages to industry characteristics.

Previous studies fall into two broad categories. The first group

consists of studies attempting to relate industry attributes and average worker
characteristics to a measure of industry average wages. Selected industry-level

(or macro) studies are summarized in table 2. The aggregate nature of the data
typically leads to difficulties in adequately controlling for worker characteristics.

A major conceptual problem arises in the interpretation of these macro

estimates. For example, if an individual's wage depends on his or her own union
status as well as the extent of unionization in his or her industry of employment,

the macro estimates of the impact of union density on industry average wages in-

7

volve a combination of the two effects.9 The industry level studies, with the
exception of Moore, Newman and Cunningham (1985), also do not allow one to determine the potential differences in impact of industry characteristics on union
and nonunion wages.

The second group of studies add industry level variables to individual level

data sets which include individual worker characteristics. Selected studies of
this type are summarized in table 3. The large micro data sets utilized in these

studies permit detailed controls for worker characteristics.

Individual level

data with information on the union status of workers potentially allows the in-

vestigator to estimate separate effects of industry attributes on collectively
bargained wages and on nonunion wages. The merging of data on individuals with
industry data also permits one to include both micro and macro features of other

variables that may affect earnings. In particular, an individual's earnings may
depend on his or her own attributes and the characteristics of his or her establishment as well as on the attributes of the industry.

The existing micro studies suffer from several conceptual and econometric
difficulties. A particular problem involves the use of variables from an incor-

rect level of aggregation, such as industry average plant size rather than the
size of the plant in which each individual is employed and a concentration ratio
measure at an aggregation level not closely related to the relevant product mar-

kets. This type of aggregation problem is likely to bias the estimates and lead
to incorrect standard errors (Dickens and Ross, 1964). The inclusion of aggregate
(or grouped) data in a micro specification even if it is at the correct level of

aggregation typically means that the OLS standard errors are incorrect and exaggerate the significance of the included aggregate variables (Moulton, 1965). This
is because there are typicaly common group error components. None of the existing

studies have used CLS to obtain correct standard errors. We shall discuss the

8

statistical significance of the findings in these studies based on the standard
errors presented by the authors of the studies. The

caveats

noted here indicate

that the results for the industry level variables in these equations are probably

less precise than indicated by the standard errors reported by the authors.

A. Extent of Unionization: The extent of union organization of an industry is
likely to affect the wages of both union and nonunion workers employed in the
industry. An increase in the extent of unionization in a product market is likely

to reduce the ability of purchasers to substitute nonunion for union products and

thereby tends to lower the elasticity of demand for organized workers.1° The improved trade-off between wages and membership employment for the union suggests,

all else equal, a positive relationship between union wages and the extent of
industry organization.

11

The direction of the impact of the extent of unionization on nonunion wages

is unclear a priori. Increased union wages may increase the threat of organization for nonunion firms and lead to the payment of higher nonunion wages to help
prevent unionization. Increased costs of union firms may lead to shifts of demand

toward nonunion products raising the demand for nonunion workers. On the other
hand, reduced employment in the union sector may increase the supply of labor to

nonunion firms in an industry. These changes in demand and supply for nonunion
workers should not have permanent effects on nonunion wages in the industry relative to the wages of nonunion workers in other industries given worker mobility
across industries. The typical finding of the studies summarized in table 2 with
respect to the relation between union density and industry wages is that they are

positively related in the presence of limited controls for worker quality and
other industry characteristics.

But, there are the problems of interpretation

discussed above.

9

A number of the studies utilizing micro data on earnings have controlled both

for individual union status and for industry union density. Freeman and Medoff
(1961) estimate separate union and nonunion earnings including an industry extent

of unionization measure as well as controls for other individual and industry
characteristics using pooled CPS data for production workers in manufacturing.
They find that union density has a large positive effect on union wages and little

impact on nonunion wages. In contrast, Podgursky's (1986) results with a similar
sample indicate a large positive effect on industry unionization on the wages of

nonunion workers in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. The Podgursky and
the Freeman and Medoff studies differ in the controls for other industry characteristics included in the wage equations.
Moore, Newman, and Cunningham (1985) separately aggregate CPS data for union

and nonunion workers into fairly broad industry-occupation-region cells. They

also find a positive effect of union density on nonunion wages. Their use of
unweighted regressions with data separately aggregated into union and nonunion
groups is likely to avoid some of the problems in inference from combining data
of different levels of aggregation.

Existing studies generally find that industry union density is positively

related to the earnings of union and nonunion workers. The positive effect on
nonunion wages is consistent with union threats acting to keep nonunion wages in

heavily unionized industries high. The estimates appear quite sensitive to the

particular data set utilized and to the other industry attributes included as
regressors. The studies surveyed which allow differential impacts of extent of
unionism on union and nonunion wages yield coefficient estimates on the industry

percent unionized variables in log wage equations ranging from .045 to .460 for
union workers and from - .013 to .421 for nonunion wages.

10

B. Concentration and other Product Market Power Measures: Alternative

models

of the labor market provide many rationales for an observed relationship between
measures of product market power and wages. A potential competitive labor market

explanation for a positive relationship between product market power and wages

even after controlling for observed worker characteristics is complimentarity

between capital and unobserved skills.

This link relies on a view that

capital-intensive industries are likely to be more concentrated and typically more

likely to generate monopoly rents for incumbent firms. The union threat model
and some other models in which insider workers have bargaining power imply that

workers should share in product market rents in the form of higher wages. The
same relationship arises from efficiency wage models in which workers notion of
fairness are related to the firm's ability to pay.12 Additionally, one attribute
of expense-preference behavior by managers in noncompetitive product markets may
be the paying of higher wages to reduce managerial effort required for monitoring
workers or for dealing with turnover. This type of behavior may not be very costly

to a firm in a market where efficiency wage considerations are important.13

Weiss (1966) and Masters (1969) both find that concentration has a strong

positive relationship to earnings when no labor quality variables are included

as controls. Weiss also finds that the effect of concentration on earnings is
greatly reduced once detailed personal characteristics are included as controls
in a micro earnings equation. Weiss concludes that employers in more concentrated
industries appear to pay their employees more, but that they get higher "quality"

labor in exchange. On the other hand, Kwoka (1983), Long and Link (1983), Mellow

(1982), and Heywood (1986) find a large positive and and significant effect of
industry concentration on wages utilizing individual level data on earnings and
worker characteristics combined with other industry level variables. The studies
presented in tables 2 and 3 indicate that the relationship between concentration

11

and wages is quite ambiguous when detailed labor quality controls are utilized.

Furthermore, concentration has been sharply criticized as a measure of product
market power and monopoly rents (Phillips, 1976).

Pugel (1980) and others have argued that economic profitability is a better

measure of product market power across industries than concentration. The major
problem that arises is getting an empirical measure of of economic profitability

given the lack of a tight relationship between available measures of accounting
profits and the theoretical construct of economic profitability.14 Pugel (1980)

and Hodson and England (1986) find strong positive effects of industry profitability measures on average industry wages even with controls for average worker

characteristics, union density, and other industry variables including the rate
of employment growth. Both these studies find that wages are much more strongly

related to direct measures of profits than to concentration. This positive re-

lationship between wages and profitability is apparent even though the direct
effect of higher wages is to lower profits. Alternatively, Kumar (1972) finds a
much larger impact, on wages of unskilled workers, for concentration than for a

measure of profits in a small sample of Canadian industries.

None of these

studies permit one to determine if product market power has differential impacts

on the wages of union and nonunion workers. Kalachek and Raines (1976) add an
industry rate of return variable to a micro earnings equation and find a significant positive effect on union wages and little impact on nonunion wages.

Industry wage differences appear to be related to ability-to-pay although

measurement problems in variables such as concentration and accounting profits

mean these conclusions should be be viewed as tentative.

Several studies

(Heywood, 1986; Weiss, 1966; Mellow, 1982; and Jenny, 1978) indicate that interaction effects between concentration, extent of unionization, and individual Un-

12

ion status might be important for sorting out the effects of concentration on
earnings.

C.

Plant and Firm Size: Large

employers typically pay more than small employers

within a given industry.b Masters (1969) reports a positive simple correlation
between industry average wages and the industry proportion of workers in large
plants. Most models of wage determination can be made consistent with this positive relationship between wages and employer size. Di (1983) argues that large

employers hire higher quality employees to conserve on managements time since
better workers are easier to monitor. Alternatively, some have argued that the
shirking version of the efficiency wage model implies that higher wages are paid
by large firms, holding worker quality constant, to conserve on monitoring costs

and create incentives against poor performance. It is argued that this relation
holds because monitoring is likely to be quite costly in large organizations and
because large plants often have integrated production processes utilizing expen-

sive equipment. Masters (1969) further suggests that large plants need to pay
compensating differentials for the regimentation of work typically found in these
settings.

Additionally, large nonunion establishments may be potential union

organizing targets and pay high wages to avoid unionization.

The proportion of workers in an industry in large plants and the average
establishment size have typically been found to be positively related to industry
wage levels even in the presence of detailed control variables (Kwoka, 1983; Long

and Link, 1983; Pugel, 1980 and many others). Although establishment size and
firm size appear to have quite important effects on wages within industries, they

cannot explain much of inter-industry wage differentials. The May 1979 CPS con-

tains a special survey including questions on establishment and firms size.
Krueger and Summers (1986) find in analyzing this data set that the inclusion of

I 3

plant size and firm size controls barely affects the estimates of industry wage
differentials. They find the employment weighted standard deviation of two-digit
industry log wage differentials falls only from .104 to .099 when plant and firm
size controls are added to a log earnings equation with controls for occupation,

region, union status and individual characteristics. The raw correlation of the
estimated industry differentials with and without employer size controls is .96.
Katz (1986) finds that estimated industry differentials are only slightly affected

by the inclusion of plant size and firm size dummies when nonunion workers are
analyzed alone.

Brown and ?ledoff (1985)

present the most detailed analysis of the re-

lationships among plant size, firm size and wages.

Brown and Medoff find that

plant size and firm size have distinct positive effects on wages for both union

and nonunion employees. They conclude that most of the employer size effect on

wages occurs within detailed industries and that a large employer size effect
persists even after controlling in detail for worker quality and working condi-

tions in several data sets. Employer size appears to be an important factor in
explaining intra-industry wage differentials, but not very important in explaining differences in wage levels across industries.

D.

Other Industry Characteristics: The

variables

differences in results for

a

variety

of

across studies are highlighted for micro and macro industry wage studies

in tables 4 and 5 respectively. Capital-intensity is one variable that efficiency

wage models and insider bargaining models indicate is likely to be positively

related to worker bargaining power and wages (Dickens, 1986). Haworth and
Rasmussen (1971), Hodson and England (1986), and Lawrence and Lawrence (1986) all

find that the capital-to-labor ratio has a strong positive relationship with in-

dustry average wages. A basic simultaneity problem makes it difficuli tc deter-

14

mine whether these findings mean that capital intensive industries need to pay
high wages or that high wages generated for other reasons lead to the substitution

of capital for labor.

The studies reviewed in this section indicate that conclusions concerning
the industry characteristics that affect wages are quite sensitive to the spec-

ification (e.g. other control variables included) and to the particular sample

analyzed (e.g. time period and group of industries included). These findings
suggest the effects are not uniform across industries and that multicollinearity

makes it quite difficult to sort out the effects of individual industry attributes. These problems are studied in detail in the next section.

IV.

Correlates of

Industry Wages.

As the last section makes clear, there are a number of problems with sole

reliance on the results of previous studies for the purposes of our analysis.

First, only a few of the previous studies have distinguished between wages of
union and nonunion workers.

Most economists would expect the wages of union

workers to be set in a noncompetitive manner, but how wages are set for nonunion

workers is an open question. Below we analyze union and nonunion wages separately. Second, many results reported above are sensitive to the specification
of the wage regression. What we can not tell from the literature survey is whether

the results presented in each study are representative of a wide range of specifications or idiosyncratic to the particular specification chosen. If a result
is idiosyncratic - -

unique

to a particular sample or some unusual set of control

variables -- we may wish to ignore it as not representative of the behavior across

most industries or as being due to the inclusion of theoretically inappropriate
controls.

Below we analyze a large number of specifications to determine which

results are representative and which are idiosyncratic. Finally, the discussion

15

above pointed out several econometric problems with past studies which are reme-

died in the analysis presented below. To avoid

confounding

the effects of indi-

vidual and industry characteristics, we use micro data. One approach would be
to include the industry variables in with the micro data and to use a GLS estimator

to deal with the industry error components. This approach would be expensive and

unwieldy given the number of different specifications we wish to examine.

In

addition, the level of aggregation problems discussed in section III can lead to

biased coefficient estimates. Since we are only concerned with the coefficients
of the industry characteristics, we take a second approach.
We have estimated wage equations in two steps. In the first step, we regress

wages on a number of individual characteristics, geographic dummy variables and
three-digit 1980 Census of Population code dummy variables. In the second step,

the coefficients on the three-digit industry dummies are regressed on industry

characteristics. Dickens and Ross (1984) suggest this approach as a possible
solution to the aggregation problem which results from the correlations between

the characteristics of individual workers and the deviations of the attributes
of their firms' characteristics from industry averages.

For large numbers of

people in each industry, this method produces reliable parameter estimates even
in the presence of such correlations. The results in Dickens (1985) suggest that
the standard errors from an OLS wage equation of this sort may differ insubstantially from those of the ideal GLS estimator where the variances of the individual

and group error components are assumed known. For several specifications we es-

timated standard errors with unweighted data, with data weighted by the square

root of group size and using White's technique.

All three methods gave

qualitatively similar results so we have used and reported unweighted OLS standard
errors.

16

A. Regression Specifications: The
CPS data

first stage regressions are run

using the 1963

set described in section II. The specification is the same as that de-

scribed above including three-digit

industry dummies and occupational dummy var-

iables. All the other covariates were also included. The industry characteristics
used as independent variables in the second stage are described briefly below and

in detail in appendix 1.

There is a problem in that the variables we use are

characteristics of the entire industry - firms -arately.

while

both

union and nonunion workers and

we are estimating equations for the union and nonunion wages sep-

Further, we know from previous studies that at least some of these

characteristics differ between union and nonunion workers within three digit industries (for example the injury rate).

If at least the ordering of the obser-

vations on each variable are correct, we can interpret these variables as indexes

for the factors they are supposed to represent.
A problem in analyzing the correlates of industry wages is that many industry

characteristics are available only for a subset of the industries we wish to examine.

The existence of many different systems for coding industry data aggra-

vates this problem since it is often impossible to impute the values for some
industries using one coding system from the values using another. Since we are

using census (CPS) data on individuals, we use 1980 Census industry codes. We
have two different ways of dealing with missing values.

In one set of specifi-

cations, we eliminated all industries for which information on any variable in-

cluded in a regression was missing.

In the other group, we set missing values

to zero and included a dummy variable for each variable with missing values. Each

dummy variable of this type was set equal to I when data were missing for the
relevant variable and zero when data were present. The first method is unbiased
as long as data are randomly missing. The second is unbiased only if the variables

17

with missing data are orthogonal to all other variables. When these orthogonality

conditions hold, the second method yields unbiased estimates even if data are

non-randomly missing and it also makes more efficient use of available data.
Since the right-hand-side variables used here are not in general orthogonal, the
use of this method involves a compromise between efficient use of available data
and different sources of bias.

The industry characteristics included in our analysis can be thought of as

falling into five groups. The classification presented below is to some extent
arbitrary since some variables could be thought of as falling into several of the
categories.

Human Capital Variables: Although we have already controlled for the standard

human capital variables at the individual level, it is possible that average
levels of observable human capital at the industry level may sti]l be correlated

with wages. Workers in industries where other workers are highly educated, more
experienced and/or have had longer job tenures than themselves may be exceptional

workers. Alternatively, better workers may be attracted to firms paying higher
wages even though those higher wages are not set explicitly to compensate them

for their human capital as in the noncompetitive wage models discussed in the
introduction. The three human capital characteristics we consider are average
years of education in the industry, average years of job tenure with current employer, and average years of labor market experience.

Discrimination or Unobserved Labor or Job Quality:

It has been argued

(Bergmann, 1971) that women and blacks may be "crowded" into certain jobs and that

that crowding may reduce their wages. The crowding would also reduce the wages
of any other workers in that job. For this reason the percent of an industries

work force which is female or black may be related to the average wage in the
industry.

It

might also be related if

skill

requirements or unobservable aspects

18

of job quality differ across industries with different racial and sex compositions. We include the percent of each industry's workers who are female and the
percent who are black as independent variables in our second stage regressions.

Compensating Differentials: Several variables are included in the analysis

because they represent characteristics of employment in an industry for which
workers might receive a compensating wage premium. These variables are the layoff

rate, the injury rate, the number of hours in the work week, the number of hours
of overtime worked, and the ratio of total compensation to wage compensation.
Labor Market Characteristics: Two attributes of industries labor markets are
included --

the

industry unemployment rate and union density. Firms in industries

with high unemployment rates may have to pay workers more to compensate them for
the prospect or frequent or long spells of unemployment.16 Alternatively, if wages
are determined by noncompetitive mechanisms, a high unemployment rate may indicate

the existence of a queue for high wage jobs.

Union density in an industry may

effect the wages of both union and nonunion workers via a number of routes as
discussed in section III.

Technology and Product Markets: Ten variables related to the structure of
each industry's product market or the technology of production were included in
the analysis: two measures of firm size (the number of employees per firm and the

dollar value of sales per firm), the four firm concentration ratio, the
capital-to-labor ratio, the ratio of R&D spending to the dollar value of sales,

the average number of employees per establishment, the fraction of production
workers In each industry's workforce, and three measures of profitability (net
income as a percent of sales, the rate of return on capital and net income per
employee) were also included.

Altogether 432 specifications were tried -- 216 for the union sector and 216
for the nonunion sector.

All specifications included the average tenure of

19

workers in the industry, their average education and job experience, union density, and

the

percent of workers who are female, black and the percent who are

production workers. Half the specifications also included the average number of
employees per firm, the average dollar value of sales per firm, the average number

of employees per establishment, the average number of hours worked each week and

the number of injuries per 10,000 workers resulting in a lost work day. All of
these variables were available for a wide range of industries.

For each of these two basic specifications, four other specifications were
created.

Each of the three profit measures was included individually with each

of the basic specifications. Two other specifications were added in which all
three profit measures were included with each of the basic specifications. These

eight specifications were repeated including the capital-to-labor ratio and the
industry unemployment rate. These two variables were also included with the two
basic specifications without profit variables for a total of ten new specifica-

tions or eighteen specifications altogether. Each of these specifications was
estimated with and without eighteen dummy variables for one and two digit indus-

tries. (See table 7 for a list of the dummies). The inclusion of these dummies
allows us to consider the effects within relatively comparable groups of industries rather than across very different industries.
specifications.

This gives us thirty-six

Each of the thirty-six specifications was repeated again in-

cluding a number of variables only available for manufacturing industries: the
four-firm concentration ratio, the ratio of R&D spending to sales, the ratio of
total compensation to wages and salaries, average hours of overtime per week and

the layoff rate. This gives us seventy-two specifications.
This hierarchical construction of the specifications was developed in part
because of the different industries for which the data on each groups of variables

were available and in part as an attempt to discover patterns with respect to

20

which variables were significant or insignificant in conjunction with what other

variables. 'e were mostly unsuccessful in this second regard.
Each of these seventy-two specifications was run on three different samples.
In the first, all observations with missing values for any of the variables were
deleted.

In the second, only manufacturing industries were included. Hissing

data were handled by setting missing elements to zero and including missing value

dummies for each variable. In the third, all industries were included and again
missing data were handled using the dummy variable technique. Each of these 216
specifications was run with the union fixed effects as the dependent variable and

with the industry fixed-effects from the nonunion regression as the dependent
variable.

B. Regression Results: Table 6 presents the raw correlations of all the variables in the industry data set. Table 7 presents the results of some representative regressions from the 432 we estimated. The results with respect to nearly
all the variables proved sensitive to the specification.

Average years of edu-

cation in the industry was the exception. It was one of only two variables with

the same sign in every specification in the nonunion sector.

It was the only

variable that was positive end statistically significant in every specification
tried. Coefficient values ranged from .04 to .15 with most falling in the middle
of the range.

The results with respect to the other two human capital variables were far

less robust. Minor changes in the specification produced sign changes for both
variables. For example, tenure generally had a positive sign and was sometimes
significant when missing values were deleted; but when dummies were used to deal
with missing values in the full sample, the sign was negative more often than not
and sometimes significant.

though never positive and significant.

Nothing

clearly distinguished these six specifications. The coefficients on the percent
of an industry's workforce which is black were less uniform. In general, it was
positive and occasionally significant though it was often negative when the sample

was restricted to the manufacturing sector or when dummy variables were used to
deal with missing data in the full sample.

The results with respect to the variables included to take account of com-

pensating differences were mixed.

The layoff rate entered most often with a

positive coefficient which was occasionally significant in the nonunion sector,
but it was mostly negative for union workers. In the nonunion sector, the injury

rate was positive and insignificant in all but eight specifications.

It was

negative in five of those and significantly positive in three. In the union sector, there were many more negative coefficients. The coefficient on hours of work

was always positive and often significant in the nonunion sector except when the

sample was restricted to the manufacturing sector. More often than not the coefficient was significant. Negative coefficients were far more common for union

workers. On the other hand, the overtime variable almost always had a negative
coefficient which was often significant. Finally the ratio of total compensation
to wage and salary compensation almost always had a negative coefficient, but the

size of the coefficient was always less than the -l that would be expected if
workers valued a dollar of benefits the same as a dollar of pay.

The relation between the wage and the industry unemployment rate varied
considerably with small changes in the specification. The sign on the coefficient

was as often negative as positive. There were a few specifications where it was

22

positive and significant in the nonunion sector and some where it was significantly negative in the union

sector.

The extent of union coverage also appears to have a somewhat ambiguous re-

lationship to wages. When the full sample was considered for nonunion workers
and missing observations were deleted, this variable was almost always positive
though only significant when the industry dummies were not included. When dummies

were used to deal with missing data, union coverage was nearly always significantly positive. When the sample was restricted to manufacturing industries,
the coefficient was often insignificantly negative. The coefficient on industry
union density was always positive and significant ranging from about .3 to .7 for
union workers.
The sign on the coefficient on the number of employees per firm was sensitive

to the sample. In the full nonunion sample it was always negative and insignif-

icant, but in the manufacturing only sample it was always positive and often
significant.

In the union sample these results were reversed. The results for

the sales-per-firm variable were somewhat more consistent.

nearly always positive and sometimes significant.

The coefficient was

The exceptions were some

specifications in which only manufacturing industries were included. The results
for the establishment size variable were even more consistent, at least for nonunion workers. In every specification the coefficient was positive and was often
significant. Only for union workers was the coefficient ever negative. The ratio

of research and development expenditures to sales was also fairly consistently
positively related to wages in the nonunion sector and was statistically signif-

icantly positive in about half the specifications. This result was reversed for
union workers with most of the specifications having a negative coefficient which

was sometimes significant. The coefficient on the percent of production workers
in the industry's workforce varied considerably depending on the sample. For the

23

full sample for nonunion workers the coefficient was generally negative and significant. For manufacturing it was generally positive and

often

significant. For

union workers the coefficient was generally negative.

The capital-to-labor ratio was nearly always positively and often significantly related to wages. In the manufacturing sample the coefficient was always

positive. The concentration ratio variable had an inconsistent relation to the
wage with both positive and negative coefficient values following no easily discernible pattern. There was only a small difference between the results for union

as opposed to nonunion workers with the coefficients for the union sector being
negative more often than for the nonunion sector.
Finally, the profitability variables performed fairly uniformly for nonunion

workers. The ratio of net income to sales and the average return on capital were
both positively related to wages in all specifications tried and were often sig-

nificantly related when entered by themselves. Profits per employee was nearly
always positively related and often significantly positively related when entered

by itself. Given the point estimates, the wage difference between an industry
with an average net-income/sales ratio two standard deviations above the mean and

one two standard deviations below the mean would range from 5% in the specification with the smallest coefficient to 12% in the specification with the largest.

Most estimates were towards the middle of that range. The same range for the
average rate-of-return on capital was from 2.5% to 15.4% and for net-income per
worker the range was from negative values to 17.6%. When all three profitability
variables were included, one or two of the variables might have a negative coef-

ficient while the other one or two would be positive. Results were less strong

for unionized workers. In those specifications the coefficients on the profit
variables were often negative.

24

An exercise similar to this can be performed for manufacturing industries

in a much earlier year.17 This is a useful comparison given the long-term sta-

bility in industry wage levels reported in previous studies (Slichter, 1950;
Dickens and Katz, 1986; Krueger and Summers, 1986). Although the micro data are

not available and far fewer of the industry characteristics can be identified,
table 9 presents the results of regressing average industry wages on a number of

characteristics of manufacturing industries using 1939 data (see appendix 2 for
a description of the data) and table 8 presents the correlation matrix for these

data. The results are consistent with those reviewed above with one interesting

exception. The average hours worked a week was consistently positive and often
significantly related to wages in the modern data.

In table 8 the correlation

is negative and the regressions yield an insignificant positive coefficient.

C. Principal Component Analysis: The correlation matrices presented in tables
6 and 8 suggest why the results are as unstable as they are. Industry characteristics are fairly highly correlated with each other.

Further, there is a

pattern to the correlation suggesting that there is one or a few underlying fac-

tors which explain the distribution of industry characteristics. This has been

the conclusion of people studying industry

characteristics

from the

"dual-economy" perspective. Several authors18 have factor analyzed industry data

and have found one dominant factor corresponding to the view that there is a
single dimension along which industries vary. At one end of this spectrum are
industries which pay high wages, have substantial market power, tend to be made

up of large firms with large establishments, have a higher union density, have
high capital-to-labor ratios and employ fewer women. At the other end are those
with the opposite characteristics.

25

We have repeated this exercise for both our modern data and the 1939 data
using principal components analyses. For the more recent data we ran two analysis
--

one for manufacturing industries and one for the full sample of industries.

In both of these analyses and in the analysis of the 1939 data, we find that the
first component extracted fits the dual economy description and accounts for over

a third of the standardized variance of the industry variables.

Table 10 presents the results for an analysis of the modern manufacturing
In these data and in the analysis of the full modern sample and the 1939

data.

data the first component accounts for over a third of the variance in the data
set. An examination of the first eigenvector in each analysis, which can be in-

terpreted as the correlation between each of the variables and the respective
component, shows the pattern predicted by the dual economy theory.

The second components of both of the analyses of the modern data are posi-

tively correlated with the average experience and tenure of the the workforce,
union coverage, the unemployment rate, the layoff rate and the injury rate. They

are negatively correlated with R&D spending, percent female and all the profitability variables. This component could reflect a declining vs. growing industry
pattern.

The first two components together account for over half the variance

both in the modern data and the 1939 data.

The remaining components add little explanatory power individually, but to-

gether with the first two it takes six or fewer components to explain
three-fourths of the variance in any of the three data sets. Ninety percent of
the variance can be explained with ten or fewer variables.

This explains the

sensitivity of the coefficient estimates in the preceding analysis.

It is fun-

damentally impossible to untangle the independent effects of all the industry
characteristics on wages with these data. A few variables, such as education,
profitability and establishment size, have sufficient independcn \:riability so

26

that they have a consistent relation with wages controlling for a wide range of
other variables. For most variables this is not the case. In general all we can
do is identify the pattern of the correlations. The principal components analysis

provides a useful summary of these results.

V.

Conclusion

It

has long been noted that wages for apparently similar workers can differ

greatly between firms in different industries. The results presented in section

II support this view.

The most conservative estimates indicate that industry

affiliation accounts for seven percent of all inter-personal wage variance for
nonunion workers.19 An upper bound on the importance of industry effects is that
they explain thirty percent of wage variance.

While the importance of industry differences is clear, the reasons for the

differences are more difficult to establish, independent of the problems of interpreting the correlates of industry differences, even the sign of the relation

of many variables with wages is difficult to discern when other variables are
included as controls. This conclusion is suggested by the literature review in
section III and confirmed by the detailed analysis of alternative specifications

in section IV. What does emerge is a pattern of correlations. There appears to
be one major dimension (and perhaps other less important dimensions) along which
industry wage patterns differ. Over a third of the standardized variation in the
three data Sets we examine can be explained by one underlying factor.
Despite these problems, there are three variables which stand out, from the
literature survey and the analysis of section IV, as having a consistent relation

with wages. Average years of education in an industry is positively related to
wages in every study in which it is included. It is also strongly positively re-

lated to wages in every specification in section IV even after controlling for

27

education at the individual level. Though not significantly related to wages in
every case, the sign on the coefficients of the profit variables included in the

studies surveyed and on two of the three measures used in section IV were consistently positive for nonunion workers.

Since we would expect a negative re-

lation between profits and wages, all else held equal, this is a remarkable
result.

Finally, workers in industries with larger than average establishment

sizes and with high capital-labor ratios appear to earn positive wage premiums
in most of the specifications reviewed in section III and in most of those tried
in section IV for nonunion workers.

The empirical analysis in section IV was not exhaustive. Only one source
of micro data from one year was used, and only a small fraction of the different

samples and specifications which were possible with the data we collected were
estimated. Still, the consistency across the studies reviewed and the equations

estimated in section IV should give us some confidence in these findings. What
can we make of them?
The results with respect to education are consistent with all of the theories

discussed in the introduction.

Those with respect to establishment size and

capital intensity can be reconciled with any of the theories by postulating a

correlation between these variables and some unobserved variable influencing
compensation.

The same is true for the profit variables, but three types of

theories would anticipate a direct relation between profits and wages --

normative

wage, insider collective action threat, and expense-preference theories.

The

observed pattern of correlations can also be reconciled with any of the theories

but would only be anticipated from the perspective of these three. Thus, the

results presented here can be seen as providing weak support for these
non-standard models of wage determination in the nonunion sector.

for our union sample. One can reject the restriction that three digit industry
wage effects do not differ within one digit industries at any standard level of

significance for both the union and nonunion samples. The difference between a
three digit and a one digit industry breakdown also seems to be economically as

well as statistically significant. The standard error for a log wage equation
with the same covariates as listed in table 1 drops from .37 to .35 when one moves

from including one digit to three digit industry dummies.

6. An alternative decomposition involves treating both industry and occupation

as structural variables. This means removing the occupation dummies from the
covariates. The industry and occupation dummies combined explain from 14 to 46
percent of the wage variation in the nonunion sample. The remaining covariates
account for 12 to 44 percent of the variation. The addition of industry-occupation

interaction dummies raises the overall R-squared to .604. One can reject at any

conventional significance level that the interaction terms do not matter. The
industry-occupation cell fixed effects explain 17 to 50 percent of the total sum
of squares.

7. Direct estimation of the variance components attributable to the covariates
and to industry effects is prohibitively expensive for a large data set with a
many unbalanced cells. Groshen (1985) provides a more detailed justification for
the procedure we utilize for calculating the "standard deviations."

11. This improved trade-off between wages and union employment arises when union

managers in a labor market exhibiting efficiency wage behavior. He shows that
wages in an industry are likely to be positively related to industry concentration

in these circumstances. Akerlof and Yellen (1985) and Bulow and Summers (1986)
show that firms paying "too high" wages in labor markets characterized by efficiency wage payments may face only second-order losses. weiss (1966) argues that

little about relative economic profitability or the presence or absence of monopoly.

The 31 industries in the sample are printing, newspaper and magazine; printing,
book and job; automobile; rubber; iron and steel; electrical manufacturing; ag-

ricultural implements; chemicals; paint and varnish; meat packing; lumber and
miliwork; paper products; hoisery and knit goods; furniture; wool; paper and pulp;

leather tanning; boots and shoes; cotton; foundries; machines and machine tools;

heavy equipment; hardware and small parts; other foundry and machine shop products; rubber tires and tubes; other rubber products; silk; woolen and worsted;
other woolen products; cement; and petroleum refining.

The definitions, means, standard deviations, and sources of the variables
in the data set are presented in Table A2-l.

BLS data giving crude measures of

the extent of unionization by industry for 1941 is used as a proxy for 1939
unionization rates. These BLS estimates classify manufacturing industries into
four categories:

Group
Group
Group
Group

I: almost entirely under written agreements
II: large proportion under written agreements
III: about half under written agreements
IV: moderate proportion under written agreements.

We summarize the information from the BLS classifications by assigning each industry the midpoint of Lewis' (1963) informed estimates of the class limits for

each group. The variable UNION for each industry takes on the following values
depending on its BLS classification:

RA is the R-squared from a log wage regression including both the covariates and

industry dummies; RB is the R-squared from a regression of log wage on the
covariates alone; and RC is the R-squared from a regression of log wage on industry dummies alone. The covariates are education (years of schooling) and its
square; experience (age-education-5) and its square; 50 state and 11 occupation
dummy variables; dummy variables for marital status, race, sex, part-time work
and whether or not an individual lives in an S1SA; and interaction terms for both
experience and experience squared with all the other varab1es except the state
and occupation dummies and education squared. Industry refers to 3-digit 1980
Census of Population code industry dummies.

Sample stratification into cells of union and nonunion
workers permits the authors to estimate the distinct impact
of alternative union density measures on union and 000(10100
wages. Industry union density and average plant size are
found to have strong positive effects on both union and
nonunion wages. The authors utilize only a limited range of
controls for worker characteristics relative to the typical
microearningsequation. The inclusionof
the plant size variable substantially reduces the impact
of industry union density on nonunion wages for
manufacturing.

This paper estimates separate industry median earnings
equations for male and females including a large number or
industry characteristics and limited labor quality controls
as independent variables. The extent of unionization and
and profit rate have positive and significant effects on
both male and female earnings. The capital/labor ratio
and proportion of industry sales to government have strong
positive impacts on male earnings and and much weaker
relationships to female earnings. Concentration and firm
size have small and insignificant effects for both groups.

Proportion of workers in large plants and capital/labor
ratio have substantial positive effects on earnings across
specifications and sample years. Concentration found
insignificant for earnings, but positive and significant
in some specifications for total compensation. Unionization
rate has positive, although not consistently significant,
impact on earnings.

Unionization rate, average industry plant size, and
concentration all have positive and significant effects
on wages, while percentage of industry supply from imports
has a negative and significant impact on wages. The other
control variables are median age, percent of industry workers
with high school education, percent female, and proportion of
industry production in the south.
