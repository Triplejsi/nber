Estimating the Impact of Microcredit on Those Who Take It Up: Evidence from a Randomized
Experiment in Morocco

ABSTRACT
This paper reports the results from a randomized evaluation of a microcredit program introduced in
rural areas of Morocco starting in 2006 by Al Amana, the country’s largest microfinance institution.
Al Amana was the only MFI operating in the study areas during the evaluation period. Thirteen percent
of the households in treatment villages took a loan, and none in control villages. Among households
identified as more likely to borrow based on ex-ante characteristics, microcredit access led to a significant
rise in investment in assets used for self-employment activities (mainly animal husbandry and agriculture),
and an increase in profit. But this increase in profit was offset by a reduction in income from casual
labor, so overall there was no gain in measured income or consumption. We find suggestive evidence
that these results are mainly driven by effects on borrowers, rather than by externalities on households
that do not borrow. This implies that among those who chose to borrow, microcredit had large, albeit
very heterogeneous, impacts on assets and profits from self-employment activities, but small impact
on consumption: we can reject an increase in consumption of more than 10% among borrowers, two
years after initial rollout.

Introduction

Several recent randomized evaluations in di↵erent countries and contexts have found that granting communities access to microcredit has positive impacts on investment in self-employed activities, but no significant impact on overall consumption – or on overall income, when that is
measured (Attanasio et al. (2011); Augsburg et al. (2013); Banerjee et al. (2013); Angelucci, Karlan and Zinman (2013); Desai, Johnson and Tarozzi (2013)). A plausible interpretation of these
findings is that the small businesses that the households gaining access to microcredit invest in
have low marginal product of capital. Consistent with this hypothesis, these studies often find
no significant impact of microcredit access on business profits or income from self-employment
activities on average, although several do find an impact on profits for pre-existing businesses
or for businesses at the top end of the distribution of profits (Angelucci, Karlan and Zinman
(2013); Banerjee et al. (2013)). Since the marginal business funded by a microfinance loan is
often more likely to be female-operated, this interpretation (that the impact of microcredit on
overall profits is low because it mainly funds unprofitable businesses) is also consistent with the
cash-drop literature that finds that while the marginal productivity of capital appears to be
large for male-run small businesses, it is much lower for those run by women (de Mel, McKenzie
and Woodru↵ (2008)).
One remaining question about this interpretation, however, is that while the impact on average
self-employment profit is statistically insignificant in all existing studies, the point estimates are
generally positive. Moreover, in most studies, the di↵erential take-up of microcredit between
treatment and control groups is generally low, either because interest in microcredit in treatment
areas is low or because there is also some take-up in the control group (due either to leakage or
entry of competitors into the control area). This implies that the insignificantly positive point
estimates would translate into large (though still insignificant, obviously) instrumental estimates
of the impact of microcredit (as opposed to microcredit access) on the average business profit.
Could it be that the e↵ect on those who take up microcredit is actually large, although perhaps
imprecisely estimated?
The studies where microcredit access is randomized at the area level, however, generally
focus on reporting reduced-form estimates and do not use area-level access as an instrument for

1

microcredit. There are good reasons to believe that microcredit availability impacts not only
on clients, but also on non-clients through a variety of channels: equilibrium e↵ects via changes
in wages or in competition, impacts on behavior of the mere possibility to borrow in the future,
etc. Thus, the exclusion restriction – that the instrument only a↵ects the outcome through its
impact on microcredit borrowing – is likely to be violated, and studies that randomize at the
area level (rightly) avoid using area-level microcredit access as an instrument. On the other
hand, in order to maximize power in the face of low demand, most of these studies use as the
study sample a convenience sample, which surveys people who are eligible and likely to borrow
based on observables (for example demographic characteristics or prior expression of interest).
The results are thus reduced-form estimates on a specific population. Furthermore, (with the
exception of Desai, Johnson and Tarozzi (2013)) identification comes from increased microcredit
access in treatment areas (rather than no access versus some access), and we are thus not
capturing the e↵ect driven by those who want microcredit the most (who may borrow both in
control and treatment areas).
In this paper, we present results from a randomized evaluation of microcredit in rural areas of
Morocco. The study has three features that make it a good complement to existing papers. First,
it takes place in an area where there is absolutely no other microcredit penetration, before or
after the introduction of the product, and for the duration of the study. We are thus capturing
the impact on the most interested households in villages (although those are still marginal
villages for our partner, since they were chosen to be at the periphery of their planned zones
of operation). Second, we designed and implemented a sampling strategy that would give us
sufficient power to estimate the impact on borrowers, and also to capture impacts representative
at the village level Finally, we propose a strategy to test for externalities on non borrowers, and
to estimate direct e↵ect on borrowers.
Existing strategies to estimate spillovers, which use two-step randomization (e.g.Crépon et al.
(2013)) are not feasible for this question, first because excluding a subset of potential clients
once an office is open would be difficult, and second because part of the potential impact of
microcredit on non-participants would only a↵ect those eligible to be clients. We thus propose
a simple strategy, based on the di↵erent probabilities to borrow found among by the households
that were surveyed, and build this strategy explicitly into the sample design.

2

The evaluation was implemented in 162 villages, divided into 81 pairs of similar villages.
The pairs were chosen at the periphery of the zone where Al Amana, our partner microfinance
institution (MFI), was planning to start their operations. We randomly selected one village in
each pair, and Al Amana started working in that village only. In a pilot phase, we collected
extensive data on a sample of 1,300 households in seven pairs of villages (seven treatment, seven
control), before introduction of microcredit. Several months after the program was introduced
in the pilot villages, we estimated a model of credit demand in those villages and selected
a small number of variables that were correlated with higher take-up. For all the remaining
villages, before Al Amana started their operation, we conducted a short survey (which included
the variables correlated to higher take-up) on 100 randomly selected households. We then
calculated for each household a propensity score to borrow based on our model. We interviewed
at baseline and endline (two years after rollout) all the households in the top quartile of the score
(in treatment and control group), plus five households randomly selected from the rest of the
village. In addition, at endline, we added a third group which had an even higher propensity to
borrow, by re-estimating the take-up equation in the whole sample, and using the initial census
(available for all households) to construct a new score. In total, our sample includes 4,465
households at baseline, 92% of which were successfully interviewed at endline (an unusually low
attrition rate), and 1,433 new households that were added at endline.
Our sample thus has three categories of households, classified ex-ante in terms of their probability to borrow. We take advantage of the heterogeneity in the propensity to borrow in our
sample to test the existence of potential externalities from borrowers to non borrowers. We evaluate the e↵ect of the treatment on households who have a high propensity to borrow and those
who have a low probability to borrow. Finding no e↵ect on low propensity households would
indicate the absence of externalities or other e↵ects of microcredit availability on non borrowers.
Since low propensity households come from both villages with low microcredit take-up (where
almost everyone has a low propensity to borrow) and villages with higher take-up, our estimates
on this specific population are likely to capture spillovers from borrowers and anticipation e↵ect
(impact from the mere fact that microcredit is available). For most outcomes we fail to reject
that microcredit has no e↵ect on the low propensity sample. Motivated by this evidence, we use
a treatment as an instrument for borrowing, the last step of our analysis.

3

For consistency with the other papers on microcredit, we first report a complete set of reducedform estimates on the households in the top quartile of ex-ante propensity to borrow, as well
as on households that were added at endline. Even in this sample, we find fairly low take-up
of microcredit (17% in treatment and zero in control). Households in treatment villages invest
significantly more in self-employment activities, particularly agriculture and animal husbandry,
which are dominant ones (65% of the sample engages in either of these activities). We find
a significant increase in total self-employment profit on average but the e↵ect appears to be
very heterogeneous. In particular, the e↵ect on profits is significantly positive at the higher
quantiles of profitability (as in other studies) but significantly negative at the lower quantiles.
The moderate increase in self-employment income is o↵set by a decrease in employment income,
which comes from a drop in labor supplied outside the farm or household business. Overall,
income increases (insignificantly) and consumption declines slightly (again, this is insignificant).
Finally, similarly to other studies, we find a significant decline in nonessential expenditures
(expenditures on festivals), but no change in any of the other “social outcomes” often meant to
be a↵ected by microcredit.
We then present, for our key variables, estimates of the impact of making microcredit available
in a village on the population as a whole. We do this by using our entire endline sample
and applying the sampling probability in order to appropriately weight the observations. The
bottom line is similar. Not surprisingly, take-up of microcredit is even smaller in this sample:
13%. Yet, the relatively small di↵erence between the average household and one determined
to be “high probability” underscores how difficult it is to predict who will take up microcredit.
Correspondingly, the impact on most variables of interest is also smaller. However, even at the
population level, we find that microcredit access significantly increases sales and expenditures
in the business (however there is now a negative and insignificant e↵ect on profits). We also find
significant declines in labor supplied outside the home and salary income, and an insignificant
decrease in consumption.
As we mentioned, our test of externality fails to reject the hypothesis of no externality, on every
variable considered individually except for two (labor supply outside the home and income). Of
course, a caveat could be the lack of statistical power. We nevertheless move on to present
an instrumental variable estimate of the impact of microcredit, using a dummy for being in a

4

treatment village as an instrument for take-up. This essentially scales up our previous estimates,
and gives us a sense of what the relatively modest reduced-form impact at the village level (or
for likely borrowers) implies for those who actually borrow. On average, the point estimate
suggests roughly a 50% increase in asset holding, a doubling of sales, and a more than doubling
of profits. Labor outside the home declines by about 50% both in terms of earnings and hours
supplied.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that our profit estimates imply an average return
to microcredit capital in terms of business profit of around 140%, not taking into account
interest payments. Given this appealing figure, why aren’t more people taking out loans? One
possible reason is that, according to our estimates, the impacts of credit on profits are very
heterogeneous. We present counterfactual distributions for profits among compliers based on
Imbens and Rubin (1997): 25% of the compliers in the treatment groups have negative profits,
while almost no one in the control group does. Given this risk level, it is plausible that individuals
do not fully know what kind of returns to expect and are therefore hesitant to borrow. Another
possibility is that profits do not capture welfare improvement. We observe no change in total
income and consumption and a drop in hours worked outside the home. We do not observe
significant increase in labor supply in the household business, but the confidence interval does
not rule out a relatively large increase, and it is plausible that labor in the business was not
adequately measured, or that the hours spent taking care of a larger business are more stressful
for the households. (Otherwise, it would suggest that the entire increase in total income due to
microcredit is spent on leisure, which seems somewhat implausible given that households do not
work very many hours to start with.)
Overall, our study confirms the key finding from other research: even in an environment with
very little access to credit, the aggregate impact of microcredit on the population at large is
fairly limited, at least in the short term. This holds true even for those who are most predisposed
to borrow. We can reject that household consumption increased by more than 10% monthly
among those who take up a loan. But our study reveals that, at least in this context, these
lackluster impacts appear to result from the combination of several o↵setting factors. First,
the take-up is low, even in these rural areas of Morocco where there is essentially no formal
credit alternative. Second, among those who take up, there are proportionally large average

5

impacts on self-employment investments, sales, and profits although there also appears to be
great heterogeneity in these e↵ects. Third, in the Moroccan context, those gains are o↵set by
correspondingly large declines in employment income, stemming from substantial decline in labor
supplied outside the household. Thus, some households choose to take advantage of microcredit
to change, in pretty significant ways, the way their lives are organized. But even these borrowers
do not appear to choose microcredit as a means to increase their standard of living, at least in
the relatively short run.

Context and evaluation

2.1

Al Amana’s rural credit program

With about 307,000 active clients and a portfolio of 1,944 million Moroccan dirhams or MAD
(235 million USD) as of December 2012, Al Amana is the largest microfinance institution in
Morocco. Since the start of its activities in 2000, Al Amana expanded from urban areas, into
peri-urban and then to rural areas. Between 2006 and 2007, Al Amana opened around 60 new
branches in non-densely populated areas. Each branch has a well-defined catchment area served
by credit agents permanently assigned to the branch.1
The main product Al Amana o↵ers in rural areas is a group-liability loan. Groups are formed
by three to four members who agree to mutually guarantee the reimbursement of their loans.
Loan amounts range from 1,000 to 15,000 MAD (124 to 1,855 USD) per member. It can take
three to 18 months to reimburse loans, through payments made weekly, twice a month, or
monthly. For animal husbandry activities, a two-month grace period is granted. Interest rates
on rural loans ranged between 12.5% and 14.5% at the time of the study (i.e. between 2006 and
2009). To be eligible for a group-liability loan, the applicant must be between 18 and 70 years old,
hold a national ID card, have a residency certificate, and have been running an economic activity
other than non-livestock agriculture for at least 12 months. Unlike most MFIs worldwide, Al
Amana does not restrict its loans to women exclusively, but it does generally require that credit

exact area, and therefore villages, that are eligible to be served by the branch. An intervention area can consist
of one to six rural communities, and several villages belong to a community.

agents have at least 35% of women among their clients. However, this requirement was first
removed among the branches participating in the study and then among all branches.
From March 2008, individual loans for housing and non-agricultural businesses were also
introduced in rural areas. These loans were larger (up to 48,000 MAD, or about 6,000 USD),
had an additional set of requirements, and were targeted at clients that could provide some sort
of collateral. During our period of focus, households almost only took out group-liability loans,
so this study is primarily an evaluation of that product.

2.2

Experimental design and data collection

The design of our study tracked the expansion of Al Amana into non-densely populated areas
between 2006 and 2007. Before each branch was opened, data was collected from at least six
villages located on the periphery of the intervention areas – villages that could either have
been included or excluded in the branch’s catchment area. Villages that were close to a rural
population center or along a route to other areas served by the branch were excluded, as this
would have disrupted Al Amana’s development. A very small number of villages where other
MFIs were present (less than 2%) were also excluded. Selected villages were then matched in
pairs based on observable characteristics (number of households, accessibility to the center of
the community, existing infrastructure, type of activities carried out by the households, type of
agriculture activities). On average, two pairs per branch were kept for the evaluation. In each
pair, one village was randomly assigned to treatment, and the other to control. In total, 81 pairs
belonging to 47 branches were included in the evaluation.
Between 2006 and 2007, Al Amana opened new branches in six phases. These branches
were opened throughout rural Morocco.2 For the purposes of our evaluation, we divided this
expansion into four periods, and conducted the baseline survey in four waves of field operations
between April 2006 and December 2007. Our sampling strategy followed a novel approach to
maximize the evaluation’s power to detect both direct and population-level e↵ects of microfinance
access. Specifically, we selected two samples of households: one containing those with the

2

Our sample is spread throughout rural areas of the entire country. Opened branches, 47 in total, are located
in 27 provinces belonging to 11 regions (out of a total of 16 regions in the country) and cover all main dialects
spoken in the country. Figure B1 in the Online Appendix shows the spatial distribution of Al Amana branches
participating of the study.

highest probability to become clients of the microfinance institution and one containing a random
selection of households from the rest of the population. Using the first sample increases the
probability to detect an e↵ect on those who are the most likely to become clients, if there is one.
Using both samples together, with appropriate weights, allows us to measure the e↵ect on the
whole population of o↵ering access to microfinance services.
To this end, in each of the fourteen villages of the first wave, we sampled 100 households
to whom we administered a full baseline survey. In villages of fewer than 100 households, we
surveyed them all. This wave took place in April-May 2006, six months before the scheduled
launch of the second wave. We used data from this survey and administrative data on credit
take-up in treatment villages over the first six months (reported weekly by credit agents) to
estimate a model to predict the likeliness to borrow for each household. We present the result
of this model in Appendix Table A1.
Based on this model, we designed a short survey instrument including the key variables
predicting a higher likelihood to borrow.

3

For each of the subsequent waves, we started by

administering this short survey to a random sample of 100 households in each village (or all the
households if the village had fewer than 120). We entered survey data on computers on site, and
an Excel macro selected the top quartile of households predicted to be the most likely to borrow
on the basis of the model, as well as five additional households from the rest of the population.
We administered the full baseline survey to this sample.
The baseline survey included questions on assets, investment and production in agriculture,
animal husbandry, non-agricultural self-employment activities, labor supply of all household
members (hours and sectors), as well as a detailed consumption survey. Since microcredit aims
to have broad impacts on behavior and wellbeing, we also included questions on education,
health, and women’s decision-making power in the households.

3

The variables collected in this short survey were the following: household size, number of members older
than 18, number of self-employment activities, number of members with trading or services or handicraft as main
activity, gets a pension, distance to souk (in km), does trading as self-employment activity, has a fiber mat, has
a radio, owns land, rents land, does crop-sharing, number of olive and argan trees, bought agriculture productive
assets over the past 12 months, uses sickle, uses rake (in agriculture), number of cows bought over the past 12
months, phone expenses over the past month (in MAD), clothes expenses over the past month (in MAD), had an
outstanding formal loan over the past 12 months, would be ready to form a four-person group and guarantee a
loan mutually, amount that would be able to reimburse monthly (in MAD), would take out a loan of 3,000 MAD
to be repaid in nine monthly installments of 400 MAD.

8

After the baseline survey was completed in each wave, one treatment and one control village
were randomly assigned within each pair. In treatment villages, credit agents started to promote
microcredit and to provide loans immediately after the baseline survey.4 They visited villages
once a week and performed various promotional activities: door-to-door campaigns, meetings
with current and potential clients, contact with village associations, cooperatives and women’s
centers, etc.
Two years after the start of each wave of the Al Amana intervention, we conducted an endline
household survey, based on the same instrument, in the same 81 pairs of villages (May 2008January 2010). 4,465 households interviewed at baseline were sampled for endline.5 Of them,
92% (4,118 households) were found and interviewed again. To maximize power, an additional
1,433 households (also predicted to have a high probability to borrow based on the credit model
and the data from the short-form survey) were sampled at endline. To select these additional
households, we re-estimated the model to predict the likelihood to borrow for each household
using administrative data on who borrowed by the time of the endline survey (i.e. over the two
years of the evaluation time frame), matched with data collected with the short-form survey
before the rollout of microcredit (and hence not a↵ected by the rollout), updated the dependent
variables including clients over the two-year period, and re-estimated the coefficients of the
model. This allowed us to much better identify likely borrowers. 6 Thus, the endline household
survey was conducted, in total, with 5,551 households.7

4

By the time of the baseline survey, branches were fully operational and were conducting business in the center
of their catchment areas (within a 5 km radius of the branch location). Once the baseline survey was completed,
credit agents started to cover the whole branch catchment area, with the only exception of control villages.
5
In wave 1 villages, we kept for the analysis 25% of households with a high probability to borrow, plus five
households chosen randomly.
6
Note that the sample is still selected using a linear combination of variables collected at baseline (the same
in treatment and control villages) and is therefore not endogenous to the treatment.
7
Out of the 5,551, to remove obvious outliers without risking cherry-picking, we trimmed 0.5% of observations
using the following mechanical rule: for each of the main continuous variables of our analysis (total loan amount, Al
Amana loan amount, other MFI loan amount, other formal loan amount, utility company loan amount, informal
loan amounts, total assets, productive assets of each of the three self-employment activities, total production,
production of each of the three self-employment activities, total expenses, expenses of each of the three selfemployment activities, income from employment activities, and monthly household consumption), we computed
the ratio of the value of the variable and the 90th percentile of the variable distribution. We then computed the
maximum ratio over all the variables for each household and we trimmed 0.5% of households with the highest
ratios. Analysis is thus conducted over 5,424 observations instead of the original 5,551, and no further trimming
is done in the data.

2.3

Potential threat to experiment integrity

The experimental design was generally well respected, and we observe essentially no entry of Al
Amana (or any other MFI, as it turns out) in the control group.8 Villagers did not travel to
other branches to get loans either.
Attrition was not a major concern in the experiment since 92% of the households in the
baseline were found at endline. (Attrition is slightly higher in the treatment group at 8.6%,
compared to 6.8% in control; see Table 1, Panel B.) Tables B3 and B4 compare attrition in the
treatment and the control groups, and examine the characteristics of the attritors compared to
non-attritors. Table B3 focuses on attrition of the baseline sample, while Table B4 uses the
short form survey to examine attrition in the full endline sample (including households that
were not included at baseline). Attritors belong to smaller households with younger household
heads, and are less likely to have a self-employment activity. We then look at whether attritors’
characteristics di↵er between the treatment and control groups (Panel C of Tables B3 and B4).
We find only one characteristic that di↵ers for attritors in treatment villages (they are relatively
more likely to run a self-employment activity).
Next, we examine balance between treatment and control. Table 1 provides means in the
control group and the treatment-control di↵erence for the variables collected in the baseline
survey of 4,465 households. In Appendix Table B1 and B2, we reproduce the same analysis
for the whole sample of 5898 households and for the 4934 households with high probability to
borrow.
Unfortunately, there are some di↵erences between the treatment and control groups, more
than would be expected by pure chance (although we know that the randomization was well
done, since it was carried out in our office, by computer). Jointly, these baseline characteristics
are di↵erent in the treatment and control groups. At baseline, households in treatment villages
had on average a slightly larger access to financial services, but not larger loans. They had higher
probability to be engaged in livestock activity in treatment villages, and hence larger sales and
assets, and lower probability to run a non-farm business. As a result of these imbalances, we
8

A few of the originally selected pairs of treatment and control villages were removed from the sample early
on – before data collection – because it turned out that the treatment and control villages were served by another
Al Amana branch. A few more were removed because Al Amana decided not to operate in their area at all.
Implementation was done e↵ectively and according to plan in the rest of the sample.

include individual-level control variables in our analysis, and present a robustness check without
such control variables in the appendix. Our results are not sensitive to control variables.

Reduced-form results

For consistency with the other papers in the literature, we first report a set of reduced-from
results on the sample of likely borrowers (the top quartile of households selected to be most
likely to borrow). We then turn to population-level estimates, and estimates of the impact of
the treatment on the treated.

3.1

Specification

We estimate the following reduced-form specification.

ypij = ↵ + Tpi + Xpij +

p
X

m 1(p

= m) + !ij

(1)

m=1

where p denotes the village pair, i the village and j the household. Tpi is a dummy for the
introduction of microcredit in village i, ypij is an outcome for household j in village i in pair p.
Xpij is a vector of control variables.9 The regression includes the 81 pair dummies represented
P
by pm=1 m 1(p = m). Standard errors are clustered at the village level.
Equation 1 is estimated on two di↵erent samples. The first is the sample of households more

likely to become clients of the microfinance institution (see Section 2.2). In Section 4.2 we also
present estimation results obtained using the whole sample, using sampling weights to obtain
results representative of the whole village population. As we evaluate the e↵ect of microcredit
on a large number of outcomes, we account for multiple hypothesis testing. Each table of results
we present focuses on a specific family of outcomes for which we produce (in the last column)
an index (which is the average of the z-scores of each outcome within the family). Furthermore

9

The basic set of covariates most of our regression includes the number of household members, number of
adults, head age, does animal husbandry, does other non-agricultural activity, had an outstanding loan over
the past 12 months, household spouse responded the survey, and other household member (excluding the head)
responded the survey. Since part of the sample includes households that were only included at endline, we do not
have baseline information for them. In regressions, we enter a dummy variable identifying them and set to zero
the other covariates. We present in Appendix Table B7 regression results in which no covariates are introduced
and a table in which an extended set is considered.

11

we report both the standard p-value and the p-value adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing
across all the indexes.10

For a reduced set of outcome variables (and still for the sample of likely borrowers), we also
consider the corresponding quantile regressions. To perform the regression we follow Chamberlain (1994) and simply compute the desired quantiles of the considered outcome variable in each
village and then implement minimum distance estimation, explaining the di↵erent estimated
quantiles by the treatment variable and pair dummy variables. We consider quantiles 10, 25,
50, 75 and 90%.

Access to credit

Table 2 presents the results on credit access and borrowing. As in previous studies (Banerjee
et al. (2013); Karlan and Zinman (2010)), we find that households tend to underreport borrowing:
administrative data suggest that 17% of households in this sample borrow in the treatment
villages (and none in the control villages), while in survey data only 11% of households admit
to borrowing. The administrative data is more reliable in this context, and this is what we
will use for the first stage in our instrumental variable regressions below. Access to any other
form of formal credit is very limited. In the control villages, 2% of households report borrowing
from another MFI, 2% from another bank, and 2% from any other formal source. Only 6%
report borrowing from informal sources though this may be underestimated to the extent that
households do not like to admit to borrowing (as it is frowned upon by Islam), or to the extent
that informal loans between villagers are recorded as gifts. The only common source of loans
is the utility companies: 16% of households in control villages borrow from a utility company
to finance their electricity or water and sanitation installation. The pattern is very similar in
treatment villages, except that households report 1pp more borrowing from other formal sources
(there may be some confusion between these other sources and Al Amana, partially accounting
for the underreporting of Al Amana loans). Therefore microfinance was introduced by Al Amana
in our treatment villages in a context where households had very limited alternative access to

finance. This is a unique feature that sets our study apart from most other impact evaluations
of access to microfinance.
Turning to loan amounts, households in treatment villages report additional outstanding
loans of 796 MAD (USD 96) on average from Al Amana over the 12 months prior the survey.11
There are also small but significant increases in reported amounts borrowed from both other
formal credit sources and the utility companies, as well as a small insignificant substitution with
informal loans, which might be related to confusion between various types of loans, as previously
mentioned. In total, average outstanding loan amount increases by 1,193 MAD and repayment
per month increases by 33 MAD, as reported by households in treatment villages. Appendix
Table B5 uses administrative data to provide some characteristics of the loans disbursed by
Al Amana in treatment villages. According to this administrative data, clients in treatment
villages borrowed on average 10,571 MAD. This compares to outstanding loan amounts of 8,872
MAD as declared in our survey data.12 Thus, households underreport borrowing both on the
extensive and the intensive margins. In terms of other loan characteristics, clients most often
form groups of four people who act as mutual guarantors and reimburse their loans in 12 or 18
monthly installments. The average client household took up a loan 5.7 months after microcredit
was made available in the village and 50% of them took a second loan by the end of the two-year
evaluation timeframe. Most of loans were taken within the first six months (67.9%). When
applying for microcredit, most of clients (68%) declared to be planning to use the loan in animal
husbandry activities, mainly cattle and sheep rising, 26.4% in trade-related businesses, and the
remaining 5.5% in other non-agricultural businesses such as services and handicraft. It is not
surprising that no client declared an intent to allocate loans to other agricultural activities (crops
and fruit trees), as Al Amana did not lend for such activities.

3.3

Income levels and composition, and labor allocation

Table 3 shows the impact of the introduction of microcredit on self-employment activities. 83%
of the households in the control group have some form of self-employment activity – the dom-

11

Average outstanding loans of 967 MAD (796+180) represent 2.7% of average household annual consumption
in the control group. If we consider loan amounts declared by actual borrowers in our survey, this share increases
to 24% of annual consumption.
12
This amount can be directly deduced from information in Table 2 as (796+180)/(0.09+0.02)=8872.

13

inant forms being animal husbandry and agriculture – whereas only 14.7% of households have
a non-farm business (see Appendix Table B6). The results of Table 3 suggest that the introduction of microcredit leads to a significant expansion of the existing self-employment activities
in agriculture and animal husbandry, but does not help start new activities. We even find a
small non significant reduction in self-employment of 1.6 percentage points for the households
in treated villages.
Access to microfinance has a positive e↵ect on assets: the estimated impact is 1,454 MAD. We
do not find any e↵ect of microcredit on investments over the last 12 months, probably because
most additional investments caused by the new access to microfinance took place in the first
year of the intervention (since most loans were disbursed in the first six months), thus more
than 12 months before the endline.
Figure 1 shows that quantile treatment e↵ects on asset accumulation are positive at almost all
quantiles. Assets of self-employment activities mainly consist of animals (cows or goats) owned
by the households. Additional results reported in Table B6 show that the impact on the stock
of assets mainly comes from livestock activities. This building-up of assets could correspond to
business investment strategy (the assets representing unrealized profits) or to a self-insurance
mechanism (the assets are in-kind savings) or to a combination of the two.
One other important result in Table 3 is that, summed across all types of activities, there is
a significant expansion in self-employment activities (which comes from existing activity since
there is no impact on the extensive margin): revenues, expenditures and profit all significantly
increase. Profit, defined as the di↵erence between revenues and expenses, increases by 2,011
MAD, a substantial amount compared to the average profit in the control group, 9,056 MAD.
Figure 1 presents the results of quantile regressions. It shows that quantile treatment e↵ects
are significantly negative for the lowest quantile (0.10), non-significant at the median, and significantly positive for the quantiles 80 and 90. The finding that the increase in self-employment
activity is concentrated at the highest quartile echoes Banerjee et al. (2013) and Angelucci,
Karlan and Zinman (2013). Negative profits at the low end of the distribution might be partially due to long-terms investments misclassified as current expenses. These quantile treatment
e↵ects are only reduced forms: they do not necessarily mean that the impact of getting credit

14

itself has the same heterogeneity (since there may be externalities, and we do not know where
the compliers lie in the distribution of outcomes). We return to this question in 4.3.
Table 4 shows the impact of microcredit on di↵erent sources of income. The major result
in this table is that the increase in self-employment profit is o↵set by a significant decrease in
employment income. Note that, despite the fact that 83% of households have a self-employment
activity, employment income accounts for as much as 56.9% of household income while selfemployment activities account for only 32.7%. Most (90%) of employment income comes from
casual (day) labor and very little from stable salaried work (10%). The e↵ect of access to
microfinance is quite substantial, -1,052 MAD, a reduction of 6.7% compared to the control
group mean. As a result of the reduction in wage earnings, the net increase of employment and
self-employment income taken together is small and insignificant. Thus, it appears that, in this
context, microfinance access leads to a change in the mix of activities, but no income growth
overall.
Table 5 reports on the e↵ect of the introduction of microcredit on the time worked by household members aged 6 to 65 over the past seven days, for various age ranges. Column 1 shows that
there is an insignificant reduction in the total amount of hours of labor supplied, and columns
2-4 show there is substitution between the di↵erent types of activities. Considering all members
together, we find a significant reduction in work outside the home of 2.8 hours, or 8.3% of the
control group mean. Time spent on self-employment activities increases, but not significantly
so. Overall, hours of work decline in every age group, although the reduction is significant only
for the youth (16 to 20) and the elderly (51 to 65).
The reduction in labor supplied outside the home is consistent with the results on employment
income (Table 4). The relatively small increase in time spent on self-employment activities
despite increased investment may be due to the fact that investments in agriculture and animal
husbandry may not need to be coupled with a proportional increase in labor input. Still, this is a
remarkable fact: the average quantity of labor (24 hours per week) supplied per adult household
member seems relatively low, suggesting that members may have the opportunity to increase
their e↵orts by a large margin (provided that we measure time allocation correctly). This would
suggest that households take the opportunity of access to credit to invest in less labor-intensive
occupations and increase their leisure time.

15

3.4

Consumption

Table 6 reports the estimated e↵ects of the introduction of microcredit on household consumption
(expenditure and consumption of home production are both included). The table shows the e↵ect
on total consumption, either at the household level (column 2) or per member (column 1), and
by type of consumption expenditures: durables, non-durables, food, health, etc. (columns 3 to
9). Consistent with the lack of e↵ect of overall income, we find a small, negative and insignificant
point estimate on consumption (44.6 MAD per month). This absence of e↵ect on consumption
is confirmed by quantile treatment e↵ect presented in Figure 1, which shows no e↵ect at any
quantile.
Turning to the composition of consumption, we do not find the increase in durable consumption that other papers have reported, but this may be due to the fact that the survey was
administered more than 12 months after most people got the loans. Consistent with all the
other papers, we find a statistically significant reduction in nonessential expenditures (in this
case, festivals, rather than other temptation goods).

3.5

Education and female empowerment

The impact of microfinance is supposed to go beyond the expansion of business activity and
consumption levels. Indirect e↵ects such as the empowerment of women and improvements
in the health status and education levels of children are often considered potential impacts of
microfinance.
We did not see any shift in the composition of household consumption that would support
this hypothesis. Table 7 looks at other “empowerment” outcomes, namely education and female
empowerment. We find no impact on education, despite the reduction in outside labor among
teenagers (other randomized controlled trials have found di↵erent e↵ects, some finding positive
and others negative impacts).
Since the majority of borrowers of our sample are men, the expected e↵ect on female empowerment is less clear-cut than for standard microfinance programs, which tend to focus on
women. Nevertheless, we do examine the impacts on female empowerment using several proxies.

16

The first is the number of income-generating activities managed by a female household member
(column 5). In remote rural areas, such activities are usually managed by male members (1.5
activities on average compared to 0.39 for women). We also use a series of qualitative indicators
to describe female empowerment such as the capacity of women to make decisions, and their
mobility inside and outside the villages. We construct a summary index of these qualitative
variables (column 3) as they are part of the same “family” of outcomes. We find no evidence of
the e↵ect of microfinance on any of these variables or on the index.
These results are in line with the fact that only a small proportion of women borrow in
remote rural areas and that additional borrowing for men is unlikely to change the bargaining
power of women within the household. They are also consistent with the results from all the
other microfinance evaluations except for Angelucci, Karlan and Zinman (2013), which find
improvements in female empowerment in Mexico.

Estimation of externalities and instrumental variable estimates

Section 3 presented reduced-form estimates of the impacts of access to microcredit on the specific
population of households that were ex-ante the most likely to become clients of Al Amana. We
were also interested in two other questions: measuring impacts on the population as a whole,
and disentangling direct e↵ects on those who choose to borrow from indirect e↵ects on others,
such as general equilibrium e↵ects due to changes in prices, or changes in behavior stemming
from the possibility to borrow in the future. We now exploit our experimental design to get at
both questions.

4.1

Impact of access to microcredit over the whole population of selected
villages

Measuring the impact of access to credit on the village population is straightforward given our
design: we just re-estimate the same set of regressions, but using the whole sample, and weighting
appropriately using the sampling weights, so that the estimates are now representative at the

17

village level. Those results are of course representative of the marginal villages selected to be in
our experiment (and not of the entire catchment area of Al Amana branch).
Table 8 presents the results for some key outcome variables. Panel A simply reproduces
the results presented in Section 3 for the population of households likely to become clients
of Al Amana (those who were in the top quartile of the propensity score). Panel B presents
intention-to-treat estimates on the same outcomes but over the whole population selected for
the endline survey (the households in the top quartile plus the five randomly selected), weighted
by the inverse of the probability to be selected in that population. Not surprisingly, takeup of microcredit is even smaller in this sample (13%), although the relatively small (though
statistically significant) di↵erence with the “high-probability” sample underscores how difficult
it is to predict who will take up microcredit. Correspondingly, the impact on most variables
of interest is also smaller. However, even at the population level, still we find that microcredit
access significantly increases sales and expenditures in the business. We also find significant
declines in labor supplied outside the home and in salary income, and an insignificant decrease
in consumption. There is now a negative and insignificant impact on profits: combined with the
estimate on likely borrowers and the quantile regressions, which did show significant negative
treatment e↵ects at the lowest quantiles, this suggests that those who are least likely to borrow
are those with the most negative treatment e↵ect on profit.

4.2

Externalities

Prima facie, results in the previous section are not suggestive of strong externalities. We evaluate
the e↵ect of the treatment on the samples of households with high and low propensity to borrow.
Finding no e↵ect on the households who are predicted not to borrow is an indication that the
no e↵ect on non borrowers (in the form of externalities and anticipation e↵ects). In practice,
we estimate the treatment e↵ect separately for those with the highest 30% and lowest 30%
probability to borrow, and omit the middle group.
To implement this test, we first re-estimate the propensity to borrow based on actual endline
behavior. By using actual borrowing behavior as measured by the endline survey, instead of using
the model based on only pilot phase 1, we increase the predictive power of the model. This is

18

done by estimating a logit regression for the decision to become a client of Al Amana, using the
set of baseline variables obtained from the initial short survey (which we collected at baseline
well before the intervention took place, and which we have for the entire population) and village
dummies. This model is estimated on the whole set of households in treatment villages that
were interviewed at endline. The results are presented in Online Appendix Table B8. Several
characteristics are individually significant in the regression, and they are also strongly significant
taken together. The predicted probability to borrow ranges from almost zero to 0.80. It has
an interquartile range of 20 percentage points, and a 37-percentage-point di↵erence between
quantiles of order 90% and 10%. This allows us to identify reasonably well the heterogeneity
related to the propensity to borrow.
Panel C of Table 8 presents estimation results of the main equation with the two interaction
terms (high and low propensity sample).13 Column 1 presents the results on the probability to
borrow. Households in the high probability sample are 36 percentage points more likely to have
taken a loan from Al Amana than their control counterparts. In the low probability sample, the
di↵erence between treatment and control households is statistically di↵erent than zero but very
small (less than 2 percentage points). A caveat of our analysis is that a significant part of the
low-probability sample comes from villages where there is very little or no access to credit. Thus,
the estimates on the low-probability sample capture the e↵ect of credit availability in areas where
microcredit was o↵ered but where there is no demand and a combination of credit availability
and spillover (from borrowers to non borrowers) e↵ects in villages where some households took
loans.
Column 2 to 11 present the results for the key outcome variables individually. For most
outcomes, estimated values for the coefficient associated to the interaction between treatment
and the low probability sample are insignificant and generally fairly small.
An interesting exception to the finding that externalities do not seem to be important arises
from the variables on time worked by households outside the home and the income derived
from it: there we see highly significant negative impacts on hours worked outside even among

13
This equation is run without weights, to leverage to the maximum extent the power given to us by our design,
which made sure we had enough people in the sample with relatively high probability to borrow. Under the null,
OLS is BLUE and the regressions should not be weighted. With weights, we still reject the hypothesis of no
externalities, but the results are noisier.

19

low-probability households. This is surprising, as prima facie we might have expected the
externalities to run the other direction (if those who borrow free up opportunities, leading to
more jobs or increases in wages ). It could be that the ability to borrow (and thus to smooth
out shocks if needed) reduces the need for income diversification.

4.3

Local average treatment e↵ect

Motivated by the finding that externalities (except for labor supply) do not seem to be very
important, we present suggestive estimates of the impact of microcredit take-up on outcomes,
using a dummy for residing in a treatment village as an instrument for borrowing. This amounts
to re-scaling the reduced-form estimates by dividing them by 0.17. Given how noisy the evidence
on externality is, this is at best tentative; still, it is useful to get an order of magnitude of what
the reduced-form evidence would entail.
The equation we estimate is

ypij = a + bCpij + Xpij c +

p
X

m 1(p

= m) + uij

(2)

m=1

where Cpij is a dummy variable corresponding to being a client of Al Amana. This equation is
estimated using the treatment village dummy variable as an instrumental variable for Cpij , and
for comparison by OLS. The IV strategy is valid only if the assumption of no externalities is
correct.
Table 9 Panel B reports the IV estimates for the main outcome variables selected in Table
8. We present the means for compliers at the bottom of the table, as well as the control group
means.14
The IV estimates imply that, if the entire e↵ect can indeed be attributed to borrowers, the
changes induced by Al Amana are large for those who do take up, although the orders of magnitude remain plausible. Assets (column 1) increase by 64%, and production (column 2) increases
by 153% compared to the compliers’ mean. Similarly, expenses increase by 147% (column 3) and
profits by 168% (column 4). The reduction in weekly hours worked in employment activities and

14

The complier mean in the control group is calculated as E(Y (0)|C) = [E(Y |Z = 0) E(Y |Z = 1, T =
0) ⇤ (1 P (T = 1))]/P (T = 1), where Z indicates treatment assignment, T indicates being a microcredit client
and P (T = 1) the proportion of clients in Z = 1.

20

the derived income (columns 8 and 6) are also sizable, and both represent a substantial share
of compliers’ mean (wage earnings decrease from 18,530 MAD to 12,250 MAD; hours of work
decrease from 42.13 to 24 hours per week).
If we assume that the impact on profits is entirely driven by borrowers, this suggests large
average returns to microcredit loans. In Table 3, we found that impact of the treatment dummy
on profits is 2,011 MAD for the second year of the experiment (the profits are measured over
the previousyear). During that year, the average amount borrowed in the treatment group was
834 MAD (with an average maturity of 16 months).15 . If we do not value any increase in hours
worked, this suggests an average financial return to microcredit capital of 2.4, well above the
microcredit interest rate. While this number is large, it is in line with prior estimates based on
capital drop (de Mel, McKenzie and Woodru↵ (2008)), or for credit to larger firms (Banerjee
et al. (2013)).
The impacts on consumption are small and relatively precise: we can reject with 95% confidence that microcredit take-up increases consumption by more than 10%.
To assess the extent of heterogeneity in the treatment e↵ect, we first estimate, under the
maintained assumptions of no externality, the cumulative distribution of potential outcomes
(with and without treatment) for the compliers. The distribution F1 of potential outcome when
benefiting from the treatment is simply the cumulative distribution over the clients. Following
(Imbens and Rubin (1997)) , the counterfactual cumulative distribution F0 of potential outcome
when not benefiting from the treatment for the compliers/clients is given by:16

F0 (y|C) = (F (y|T = 0)

F (y|T = 1, C = 0)(1

P (C)) P (C)

15
This figure is the product of 9,520 MAD borrowed by people who borrowed, multiplied by 16% (she share of
clients), and by 52.5% (the share of clients who are borrowing in the second year). See Table B5 in the Online
Appendix, where we estimate these figures on a subsample of clients who could be matched into the Al Amana
administrative database.
16
We estimate the underlying cumulative distribution functions as step function with a large number of small
intervals. Although the corresponding estimated function is asymptotically positive and increasing, a problem
documented by (Imbens and Rubin (1997)) is that the estimated function can fail to be either positive or increasing,
and they propose a method to constrain the CDF to be non negative and increasing. Following them, we start the
estimation procedure with the first interval by applying the formula for unconstrained estimation and retaining
either the estimated value if is positive, or zero otherwise. We then estimate the CDF recursively for all the other
intervals by applying for each interval the formula for unconstrained estimation and retaining either the estimated
value if greater than or equal to the estimated value in the preceding interval, or else the estimated value in the
preceding interval. Finally, we rescale all estimates so that the cumulative distribution function reaches 1 on the
last interval.

21

Figure 2 presents the results.17 There are some interesting findings. First, while the distribution among compliers in the treatment group stochastically dominates that in the control for
asset accumulation, and there is visibly no impact on consumption, the two curves are clearly
di↵erent for profits: in the treatment groups, compliers have both more instances of low (negative) profits and high profits. Indeed, among the compliers in the treatment group, it seems
that very few people have negative profit (the estimated CDF is very close to zero), while about
25% of compliers in the treatment group have negative profits. The two curves cross for a value
of profits roughly equal to zero. On the other hand, the compliers with the top 40% of profits
have higher profits in the treatment groups than in the control group.
Turning to income from employment activities, Figure 2 shows that impact of being a client
of Al Amana also appears to be far from homogeneous on the population of compliers. As
can be seen on the graph, there is no e↵ect above the quantile of order 60%; all e↵ects are
concentrated at the bottom of the distribution. In particular, 45% of the compliers who are
clients do not supply any labor outside their own activity, compared to only 30% for the nonclients. Similarly, a higher proportion of compliers rely less on day labor income in the treatment
than in the control for low values (below 15,000 MAD) of the variables. This suggests that the
negative impact of credit on work supplied outside the home is driven primarily by households
that do not rely heavily on casual labor in the first place.
Last, Table 9 Panel A, presents the results of the OLS control variable regression estimates
obtained from a regression of our key outcomes on a dummy variable for being a client of Al
Amana on the sub-sample of households in treatment villages. The di↵erences of these estimates
with the LATE estimates are sizable both in magnitude and sign. This unsderscores the problems
associated with identification of causal e↵ect of microcerdit.

4.4

Robustness checks

In this section we briefly report on robustness checks. We experimented with changes in the
list of control variables and di↵erent ways to compute standard errors. Results are presented
in Appendix Table B7. The first panel considers simple regressions just including the set of

17
Note that we do not present confidence intervals, which would likely be wide, given that the first stage is not
very large.

22

strata dummy variables, and the second panel reproduces our previous results, including a set of
control variables listed in Table 2. This panel also provides standard errors computed assuming
clustered residuals, as well as standard errors without clusters. The last panel provides results
obtained by adding to the previous set of control variables an extended set involving, among
others, the dependent variable at baseline, as well as other variables listed in the footnote of
Table B7. As can be seen from the table, results are very robust. We obtain the same order
of magnitude for all estimated coefficients, as well as for standard errors. Expanding the list of
control variables does not lead to any gain in precision. Finally, the clustered and unclustered
errors in Panel B are quite similar, suggesting that, in this case, clustering did not have a large
impact on our standard errors.

Conclusion

In this paper, we measure the impact of access to microfinance in remote rural areas in Morocco,
where during the span of the intervention there was no access to credit outside that provided
by our partner, Al Amana.
We identified pairs of villages at the periphery of the catchment area of new branches, and
randomly selected one village in each pair for treatment. We surveyed both households that
were identified ex-ante as having relatively higher probability to borrow, as well as randomly
selected households in the village: the objective of this sampling strategy was to be able to
estimate both direct impact and possible externalities on non borrowers.
On average, take-up of microfinance is only 13% in the population and 17% in our “higher
probability” sample (and zero in the control group). Consistent with other evaluations of microfinance programs, we find that households that have access to microcredit expand their
self-employment activity (primarily agriculture or animal husbandry, in this context), and their
profits increase. Our estimates seem to suggest that these e↵ects are driven by those who actually borrow, implying that the modest reduced-form estimates actually come from fairly large
average impacts (we estimate average returns to capital of close to 100% before repayment of
interest) combined with a low take-up.
This presents a puzzle: if the returns are really that high, why are people not borrowing in

23

larger numbers? And why are half of the clients apparently dropping out after a year? We see two
plausible explanations. The first is that although microfinance is associated with large average
increases in profits, the utility gain may not be as large as these estimate suggest: running one’s
own business may be stressful (as (Karlan and Zinman (2010)) find in the Philippines). We may
also not capture increase in labor in the household’s own business, which may be difficult for
survey respondents to remember.
The second possible explanation is the substantial heterogeneity in how profitable microfinance investments are. Although noisy, both the reduced-form quantile regressions and the IV
estimates of the changes in the distribution of profit for the outcomes suggest that for a substantial minority of households (about 25% of those who take up microcredit), the impact on
profit may actually be negative. This large dispersion may explain the fairly low take-up of
microfinance: households may recognize the unpredictable rate of return, and be risk averse.
Another key finding is that despite significant increase in self-employment income (at least
among the population that is most likely to borrow), we see no net impact of microcredit access
on total labor income, or on consumption. This result is similar to what other evaluations
of microcredit programs find. In our context, this appears to be driven by a loss in income
from wage labor, which is large enough to o↵set the gain in self-employment income, and is
directly related to a substantial decline in labor supply outside the home by those who take up
microcredit.18 What is surprising is that this does not appear to be driven by time constraints:
the increase in labor supply on self-employment activities is small and insignificant, although
the confidence intervals does not allow us to rule out an increase in hours spent.
There are two plausible channels for this set of results. The first is that access to microcredit
allows households to invest in agriculture and animal husbandry and increase their profit. Leisure
being a normal good, the income e↵ect leads them to reduce their labor supplied, particularly
outside the home. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a strong disutility associated with
day labor, giving credence to this explanation. A second possible channel is that our results
reflect a shift in the way households cope with risk. Access to credit enables households to
purchase lumpy assets, such as livestock, which are typically used for self-insurance (Deaton

18

On the other hand, we find an increase in labor supply for those who are estimated to have a very low
probability to borrow, which is consistent with a relatively closed labor market: the jobs that are left by the
microcredit clients are taken up by those who do not borrow.

(1991); Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993)). This increased form of insurance can be a substitute
of other ex-ante risk-management strategies such as income diversification through day labor,
which are also taking place in the absence of formal insurance markets (Kochar (1999); Rose
(2001)). Regardless, microcredit appears to be a powerful financial instrument for the poor, but
not one that fuels an exit from poverty through better self-employment investment, at least in
the medium run (two years after the introduction of the program). We are currently following up
with the households, now that a much longer time period has elapsed, to check if the investment
in business assets paid o↵ in the longer run.

households with high probability-to-borrow score surveyed at endline, after trimming 0.5% of observations (3,525 who got both a full baseline and endline
household survey administered, plus an additional 1,409 households who got only the full endline survey administered). (see Section 3 for an explanation of
sample strategy). Coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses) from an OLS regression of the variable on a treated village dummy, controlling for strata
dummies (paired villages) and variables specified below. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. ***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10%.
Controls include: number of household members, number of adults, head age, does animal husbandry, does other non-agricultural activity, had an
outstanding loan over the past 12 months, HH spouse responded the survey, and other HH member (excluding the HH head) responded the survey.

Notes: Data source: Endline household survey. Observation unit: household. Panel A: sample includes households with high probability-to-borrow score. Panel B: sample includes both households with high
probability-to-borrow score and households picked at random. Observations are weighted by the inverse probability of being sampled. Panel C: sample includes both households with high probability-to-borrow
score and households picked at random, but only those in the top 30% and in the bottom 30% of the predicted propensity to borrow (PTB) distribution. All panels include sample after 0.5% trimming of
observations. Panel A & B: coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses) from an OLS regression of the variable on a treated village dummy, controlling for strata dummies (paired villages) and variables
specified below. Panel C: coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses) from an OLS regression of the variable on a treated village dummy interacted with a dummy equal to 1 if HH predicted propensity to
borrow is in the 0-30th percentile of the PTB distribution (Low Predicted PTB), on a treated village dummy interacted with a dummy equal to 1 if HH predicted PTB is in the 70-100th percentile of the PTB
distribution (High Predicted PTB) and on a dummy equal to 1 if HH predicted PTB is in the 0-30th percentile of the PTB distribution (not shown), controlling for strata dummies (paired villages) and variables
specified below. All panels: standard errors are clustered at the village level. ***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10%. Same controls as in Table 2.

Note : Data source: Endline household survey. Observation unit: household. Panel A: Sample includes households with high probability-to-borrow score in treated
villages. Coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses) from an OLS regression of the variable on a client dummy, controlling for strata dummies (paired villages)
and variables specified below. Client is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the household has borrowed from Al Amana. Panel B: Sample includes households with high
probability-to-borrow score in treated and control villages. Coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses) from an instrumental variable regression of the
variable on the variable client , controlling for strata dummies (paired villages) and variables specified below. Client is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the household
has borrowed from Al Amana and is instrumented with treated village , a dummy equal to 1 if the household lives in a treatment village. Standard errors are
clustered at the village level. ***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10%. Same controls as in Table 2.
†	   The complier mean in the control group is calculated as E(Y0|C)=[E(Y|Z=0)-E(Y|Z=1,T=0)*(1-P(T=1))]/P(T=1), where Z indicates treatment assignment, T
indicates being a microcredit client and P(T=1) the proportion of clients in Z=1

Notes: Data source: Mini survey. Unit of observation: household. Panel A: Sample includes households with high probabilityto-borrow score sampled at endline. Panel B: Sample includes households with high probability-to-borrow score sampled at
baseline and at endline. Panel A: coefficients from an OLS regression of the variable on a treated village dummy, controlling
for strata dummies (paired villages). Panel B: coefficients from an OLS regression of the variable on a dummy equal to 1 if
the borrower household was sampled at endline, controlling for strata dummies (paired villages). Standard errors are
clustered at the village level.***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10%.

Notes: Data source: Endline household survey. Observation unit: household. Sample includes households with high probability-to-borrow score surveyed at endline, after trimming 0.5% of observations.
Coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses) from an OLS regression of the variable on a treated village dummy interacted with a dummy equal to 1 if HH was sampled at baseline and on a treated village
dummy interacted with a dummy equal to 1 if HH was sampled at endline . Standard errors are clustered at the village level. ***, **, * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10%. Same controls as in Table 2.
