Model Disagreement and Economic Outlook

NBER Working Paper No. 20190

JEL No. G12
ABSTRACT
We study the impact of model disagreement on the dynamics of asset prices, return volatility, and
trade in the market. In our continuous-time framework, two investors have homogeneous preferences
and equal access to information, but disagree about the length of the business cycle. We show that
model disagreement amplifies return volatility and trading volume by inducing agents to have different
economic outlooks, which generates a term structure of disagreement. Different economic outlooks
imply that investors will trade even if they do not disagree about the current value of fundamentals.
Also, we find that while the absolute level of return volatility is driven by long-run risk, the variation
and persistence of volatility (i.e., volatility clustering) is driven by disagreement. Compared to previous
studies that consider model uncertainty with a representative agent or those that study heterogeneous
beliefs with no model disagreement, our paper offers a theoretical foundation for the GARCH-like
behavior of stock returns.

Introduction

The field of finance is currently grappling with the fact that there are limits to applying the
standard Bayesian paradigm to asset pricing. Specifically, in a standard Bayesian framework,
beliefs are updated with a particular model in mind. However, as noted by Hansen and
Sargent (2007), many economic models cannot be trusted completely, thereby introducing
the notion of model uncertainty. Theoretically, though, as long as the potential set of models
that all agents in an economy consider is the same ex ante, the Bayesian framework can
still apply because agents can update their beliefs about which model explains the economy.
However, if the agents consider different sets of models or they adhere to different paradigms,
then disagreement will persist regarding which model is best to describe the world or predict
the future. It is this notion of model disagreement that we focus on in this paper and
characterize its effects on asset prices, return volatility, and trade in the market.
Empirically, model disagreement appears to be important. For example, in a recent paper by Carlin, Longstaff, and Matoba (2013), the authors study the effects of disagreement
about prepayment speed forecasts in the mortgage-backed securities market on risk premia,
volatility, and trading volume. Indeed, the prepayment models that traders use are often
proprietary and differ from each other, while the inputs to these models are publicly observable (e.g., unemployment, interest rates, inflation). In that paper, the authors show that
disagreement is associated with a positive risk premium and is the primary channel through
which return volatility impacts trading volume.
In this paper, we analyze a continuous-time framework in which investors exhibit model
disagreement and study how this affects the dynamics of asset prices and trading volume.
In our setup, two investors have homogenous preferences and equal access to information,
but disagree about the length of the business cycle. Each investor knows that the expected
dividend growth rate mean-reverts, but uses a different parameter that governs the rate
at which this fundamental returns to its long-term mean. The disagreement is commonly
known, but each agent adheres to his own model when deciding whether to trade.1
Using disagreement about the length of the business cycle is natural and plausible. For
example, Massa and Simonov (2005) show that forecasters strongly disagree on recession
probabilities, which implies that they have different beliefs regarding the duration of recessionary and expansionary phases. The origin of this disagreement may arise from many
sources. Indeed, there still remains much debate regarding the validity of long-run risk
models (e.g., Beeler and Campbell (2012); Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2012)). Additionally,
in practice agents might use different time-series to estimate the mean-reversion parameter
1

This form of disagreement arises if agents are uncertain about the interpretation of public information,
even after observing infinitely many signals (Acemoglu, Bimpikis, and Ozdaglar, 2010).

(e.g., use consumption versus production data). Likewise, their estimation methods may
differ (e.g., fitting the model to past analyst forecast data versus a moving-average of output
growth versus performing maximum-likelihood Kalman filter estimation). Finally, as Yu
(2012) documents, least-squares and maximum-likelihood estimators of the mean-reversion
speed of a continuous-time process are significantly biased. Some investors might be aware
of the existence of this bias and would adjust their estimation accordingly, whereas other
investors might ignore it.2
In our equilibrium model, two distinct quantities turn out to be important determinants
of asset prices and trade in the market. The first is the disagreement over fundamentals,
which is the instantaneous difference in beliefs about the expected growth rate in the economy. The second is the difference in economic outlooks, which affects expectations of future
economic variables and takes into account how both agents will disagree over fundamentals
in the future. The differences in economic outlooks at all horizons into the future are dictated by the term structure of disagreement. Interestingly, different outlooks amplify return
volatility and trading volume, even when the agents agree about the current fundamentals.
To show this, we perform a numerical analysis that compares an economy populated by a
representative agent to that populated by two agents with model disagreement. Both settings are otherwise observationally equivalent in terms of their average expected growth rate
and average uncertainty. Additionally, we set the disagreement over fundamentals to zero.
We show that the volatility with model disagreement is higher than what an observationally
equivalent representative agent economy generates. Also, while there is no trade in the representative agent economy, as the difference in economic outlook increases, trading volume
follows suit. These results imply that model disagreement not only amplifies volatility, but
also provides an important mechanism by which uncertainty affects trade.
Also in the equilibrium of our model, we show that while the absolute level of volatility
is driven primarily by long-run risk, the variation and persistence of volatility (i.e., volatility
clustering) is driven by disagreement. Disagreement is persistent and increases the volatility
of the risk-adjusted discount factor and consequently also the volatility of stock returns.3
Persistent transmission from investors beliefs to stock market volatility via disagreement
causes excess volatility, which is time-varying and persistent. We disentangle the impact of
disagreement from the impact generated by the other driving forces by decomposing stock
return volatility. We show that, indeed, disagreement is the main driving force of persistent
2

We further justify the assumption of different parameters in Appendix A.1 by performing a simulation
exercise in which we let the agents estimate the mean-reversion parameter with different methods. We show
that the difference between the estimated parameters is typically substantial, even though we perform 1,000
simulations of economies of length of 50 years at quarterly frequency.

Persistent disagreement is consistent with empirical findings by Patton and Timmermann (2010) and
Andrade, Crump, Eusepi, and Moench (2014).

fluctuations in stock market volatility, whereas the level of the volatility is mainly driven by
long-run risk, as the long-run risk literature (Bansal and Yaron, 2004) suggests.4
Our results help to explain three well-known characteristics about financial market volatility. First, volatility systematically exceeds that justified by fundamentals (Shiller, 1981;
LeRoy and Porter, 1981). Indeed, we show that model disagreement amplifies volatility,
over and above the usual effect of uncertainty. Second, volatility is time-varying (Schwert,
1989; Mele, 2008). This arises naturally out of our model because disagreement is meanreverting. Last, volatility is persistent (Engle, 1982; Bollerslev, 1986; Nelson, 1991), occurring in clusters. This persistence (or predictability) has been described extensively in the
empirical literature, but there is a paucity of theoretical explanations. We show that model
disagreement generates a new channel of persistence transmission from investors beliefs to
stock market volatility and we fit a GARCH model on simulated stock returns to show that
volatility is indeed persistent. Our paper proposes therefore a theoretical foundation for the
GARCH-like behavior of stock returns.
Finally, we conclude the paper with a survival analysis. Indeed, in any model with
heterogeneous agents, whether all types survive in the long-run is a reasonable concern.
To address this, we perform simulations and show that all agents in our economy with
model disagreement survive for long periods of time, consistent with previous findings in
the literature (Yan, 2008). Based on this, we posit that model disagreement can have longlasting effects on asset prices without eliminating any players from the marketplace, which
likely makes our analysis economically important.
Our approach contrasts with previous work and thus adds to the previous finance literature. As already mentioned, Hansen and Sargent (2007) studies model misspecification
and model uncertainty, but does so for a single investor.5 In contrast, our study investigates
the consequence of disagreement about models in an economy with different investors. We
assume that investors disagree about the model governing the economy. Certainly, there are
many other forms of disagreement; in particular, several papers feature a setting in which
investors agree on the model governing the economy but disagree on the information that
they receive (see, e.g., Scheinkman and Xiong 2003, Dumas, Kurshev, and Uppal 2009, or
Xiong and Yan 2010). These models are able to generate excess volatility but they do not
identify the cause of persistent fluctuations in volatility.
4

We define long-run risk here as the risk associated to a persistent expected dividend growth rate only.
In Bansal and Yaron (2004) long-run risk captures the risk associated to a persistent expected dividend
growth rate, a persistent dividend growth volatility, and a persistent expected dividend growth volatility.
In contrast, we do not assume that any fundamental variable features stochastic volatility. Instead, stock
return volatility becomes stochastic in equilibrium exactly because agents disagree about the magnitude of
long-run risk. We thus argue that long-run risk per se is not a cause of fluctuations in volatility, whereas
disagreement about long-run risk endogenously gives rise to such fluctuations.

Model Disagreement

Consider a pure exchange economy defined over a continuous time horizon [0, ∞), in which
a single consumption good serves as the numéraire. The underlying uncertainty of the
economy is characterized by a 2-dimensional Brownian motion W = {Wt : t > 0}, defined
on the filtered probability space (Ω, F, P). The aggregate endowment of consumption is
assumed to be positive and to follow the process:
dδt
= ft dt + σδ dWtδ
δt

(1)

dft = λ(f − ft )dt + σf dWtf ,

(2)

where W δ and W f are two independent Brownian motions under the objective probability
measure P. The expected consumption growth rate f , henceforth called the fundamental, is
unobservable and mean-reverts to its long-term mean f¯ at the speed λ. The parameters σδ
and σf are the volatilities of the consumption growth and of the fundamental.
There is a single risky asset (the stock), defined as the claim to the aggregate consumption
stream over time. The total number of outstanding shares is unity. In addition, there is also
a risk-free bond, available in zero-net supply.
The economy is populated by two agents, A and B. Each agent is initially endowed with
equal shares of the stock and zero bonds, can invest in these two assets, and derives utility
from consumption over his or her lifetime. Each agent chooses a consumption-trading policy
to maximize his or her expected lifetime utility:

where ρ > 0 is the time discount rate, α > 0 is the relative risk aversion coefficient, and
cit denotes the consumption of agent i ∈ {A, B} at time t. The expectation in (3) depends
on agent i’s perception of future economic conditions. Agents value consumption streams
using the same preferences with identical risk aversion and time discount rate but, as we will
describe below, have heterogeneous beliefs.

Learning and Disagreement

The agents commonly observe the process δ, but have incomplete information and heterogeneous beliefs about the dynamics of the fundamental f . Specifically, the agents agree that
the fundamental mean-reverts but disagree on the value of the mean-reversion parameter λ.
As such, they have different perceptions about the length of the business cycle.

(7)

where WBδ and WBf are two independent Brownian motions under agent B’s probability
measure PB . Both agents agree on the long-term mean of the fundamental f¯ and on the
volatility of the fundamental σf .6
Neither agent uses the right parameter λ. Instead, the true parameter λ is assumed to
lie somewhere in between the parameters perceived by the agents. As such, there are 3
probability measures: the objective probability measure P and the two probability measures
PA and PB as perceived by agents A and B.
The agents both observe the aggregate endowment process δ and use it to estimate
the fundamental f under their respective probability measures.7 Since they use different
models, they have different estimates of f . Define fbA and fbB as each agent’s estimate of the
unobservable fundamental f :
fbit ≡ Eit [fit ] ,

for i ∈ {A, B},

(8)

We have considered extensions of the model where agents have heterogeneous parameters f¯ and σf , with
similar results. The parameter bearing the main implications is the mean-reversion speed λ and thus we
choose to focus on heterogeneity about it and to isolate our results from other sources of belief heterogeneity.
7
We assume that the only public information available is the history of the aggregate endowment process
δ. The model can also accommodate public news informative about the fundamental, but here we chose
not to obscure the model’s implications and we abstract away from additional public news. The effects of
heterogeneous beliefs about public news are well-understood (see, e.g., Scheinkman and Xiong (2003) or
Dumas et al. (2009) among others).

The process in Equation (10) has a simple interpretation. Agent i observes a realized growth
of dδt /δt and has an expected growth of fbit dt. The difference between the realized and the
expected growth, normalized by the standard deviation σδ , represents the surprise or the
innovation perceived by agent i.
The posterior variance γi (i.e., Bayesian uncertainty) reflects incomplete knowledge of
the true expected growth rate. It is defined by9

(11)

Equation (11) shows how γi depends on the initial parameters. The posterior variance
increases with the volatility of the fundamental σf and with the volatility of the aggregate
endowment σδ , and decreases with the mean-reversion parameter λi . Intuitively, if λi is small
then agent i believes the process f to be persistent and thus the perceived uncertainty in the
estimation is large. Since agents A and B use different mean-reversion parameters, it follows
that their individual posterior variances are different, that is, one of the agents will perceive
a more precise estimate of the expected growth rate. Therefore, one of the agents appears
“overconfident” with respect to the other agent, although overconfidence here does not arise
from misinterpretation of public signals as in Scheinkman and Xiong (2003) or Dumas et al.
(2009), but from different underlying models.

See Theorem 12.7 in Liptser and Shiryaev (2001) and Appendix A.2 for computational details.
As in Scheinkman and Xiong (2003) or Dumas et al. (2009), we assume that the posterior variance
has already converged to a constant. The convergence arises because investors have Gaussian priors and
all variables are normally distributed. This generates a deterministic path for the posterior variance and a
quick convergence (at an exponential rate) to a steady-state value.

(13)

A few points are worth mentioning. First, although the economy is governed by two Brownian
motions under the objective probability measure P (as shown in (1)-(2)), there is only one
Brownian motion under each agent’s probability measure Pi . This arises because there is
only one observable state variable, the aggregate endowment δ. Second, the instantaneous
variance of the observable process δ is the same for both agents, which is not the case for
the instantaneous variance of the filter fbi . Because of the “overconfidence” effect induced by
different parameters λ, one of the agents will perceive a more volatile filter than the other.
Furthermore, agreeing to disagree implies that each agent knows how the other agent
perceives the economy and that they are aware that their different perceptions will generate
disagreement—although they observe the same process δ. This important feature (that the
aggregate endowment process is observable and thus it should be the same for both agents)
provides the link between the two probability measures PA and PB . Writing the aggregate
consumption process (12) for both agents and restricting the dynamics to be equal provides a

Equation (14) shows how one can convert agent A’s perception of the innovation process

to agent B’s perception W

on the right hand side of (14). For example, suppose that agent A has an estimate of the
expected growth rate of fbAt = 1%, whereas agent B’s estimate is fbBt = 3%. Assume that
the realized growth rate (observed by both agents) turns out to be dδt /δt = 2%. It follows

The extra drift term in Equation (14) comprises the difference between each agent’s
estimates of the growth rate (fbBt − fbAt ) or the disagreement, which we denote hereafter by
gbt . We can now use this relationship to compute the dynamics of gbt , under one of the agent’s
probability measure, say PB .

Proof. See Appendix A.3
Proposition 1 characterizes the dynamics of disagreement10 , which yields several properties that make it different from previous models of overconfidence that have been studied in
the literature. First, if one of the agents believes in long-run risk, disagreement is persistent.
Second, if agents have different degrees of precision in their estimates (which happens to be
the case when they use different parameters λ), disagreement is stochastic. Third, because
its long-term drift is stochastic, disagreement will never converge to a constant but will
always be regenerated—even without a stochastic term.
To see this, observe that Equation (15) shows that disagreement is mean-reverting around
a stochastic mean, driven by fbB . This arises because λA 6= λB . If agents adhered to the
same models, disagreement would revert to zero, as in Scheinkman and Xiong (2003) and
Dumas et al. (2009). In contrast, in our setup, the mean is driven by fbB because the agents
use different models. In addition, if one of the agents, say agent B, believes in long-run risk,
disagreement becomes persistent because it mean reverts to a persistent fbB .11
To appreciate the relationship between the agents’ precision and the stochastic nature
of disagreement, let us focus on the stochastic term in the dynamics of disagreement expressed in Equation (15). This term arises because γA 6= γB . As previously observed in
Equation (11), different posterior variances are a result of different mean-reversion parameters. This generates stochastic shocks in disagreement. Although models of overconfidence
(Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003; Dumas et al., 2009) generate a similar stochastic term, a
key difference arises in our setup. To see this, suppose we shut down this stochastic term.
This can be done by properly adjusting the initial learning problem of the agents.12 Equation (15) shows that, even though the stochastic term disappears, disagreement will still be
time-varying—and persistent—precisely due to the first term in its drift. In contrast, shutting down the stochastic term in models of overconfidence eliminates disagreement through
prompt convergence toward its long-term mean, zero. This highlights the “structural” form
of disagreement generated by different economic models.

choose to work under agent B’s probability measure PB ; however, by using (14), we could easily switch to
agent A’s probability measure and all the results would still hold.
11
Alternatively, if agent A believes the fundamental is persistent, then we can write the dynamics of
disagreement under PA and the same intuition holds.
12
Precisely, we can consider that agents have different parameters σf chosen in such a way that γA = γB .
This will shut down the stochastic term in Equation (15).

2.2

Economic Outlook

Now, let us consider how model disagreement affects each agent’s relative economic outlook.
Since each agent perceives the economy under a different probability measure, any random
economic variable X, measurable and adapted to the observation filtration O, now has two
expectations: one under the probability measure PA , and the other under the probability
measure PB . Naturally, they are related to each other by the formula
EA [X] = EB [ηX] ,

(16)

where η measures the relative difference in outlook from one agent to the other.

(18)

Proof. See Girsanov’s Theorem.
On the surface, the expression in (17) is simply the Radon-Nikodym derivative for the
change of measure between the agents’ beliefs. But this has a natural economic interpretation
here as the difference in economic outlook between the agents, since it captures the difference
in expectations that each agent has for the future. This contrasts with previous papers that
use ηt to express differences in the sentiment between agents (Dumas et al., 2009). In
our setting, agents do not have behavioral biases like overconfidence or optimism. Rather,
because they adhere to different models of the world, they rationally have different economic
outlooks, which are not a function of how they are feeling per se (i.e., sentiment).
One important implication of Proposition 2 is that disagreement over fundamentals and
economic outlook are different entities. In fact, relative outlook is a function of disagreement,
and there may be differences in the agents’ outlook even though they agree today on the
underlying fundamentals of the economy. This is because disagreement in our setup expresses
the difference in beliefs about the expected growth rate today, while outlook enters into the
expectations of future economic variables and thus captures the way in which agents’ beliefs
will differ into the future.

Figure 1: Different economic outlooks
Expectation of future aggregate consumption computed by agent A (solid blue line) and
agent B (dashed red line). The state variables at time t = 0 are δ0 = 1, fbB0 = −1%, gb0 = 0,
and η0 = 1. Other parameters for this example are listed in Table 1.

This is best appreciated by observing that the relative difference in outlook in (17) is a
function of the integral of disagreement that is realized over a particular horizon, not just the
disagreement that takes place at one particular instant. This implies that two agents may
have very different outlooks, even though they currently agree on the fundamentals in the
market. That is, even though their models currently yield the same fundamentals, because
they use different models, they will have different outlooks for the future. This will drive the
results in future sections where we show that trading volume may be substantial even when
there is currently no disagreement about fundamentals: trade will still take place because
the agents take into account that they will disagree in the future (i.e., they have different
economic outlooks).
To see this more clearly, consider the following example. Suppose that, at t=0, fbA0 =
fbB0 = −1%. Because gb0 = 0, both agents agree that the economy is going through a
recession. Furthermore, assume that agent B believes the economic cycles are longer than
agent A, that is, λB = 0.1 whereas λA = 0.3. Figure 1 shows the different economic outlooks
that agents hold, even though they are in agreement today. It calculates the expectation of
future dividends, Ei0 [δu ]. Agent A (solid blue line) believes that the economy will recover
quickly, in about two years, whereas agent B (dashed red line) believes that it will take six
years for the economy to get back to its initial level of aggregate consumption.
It is also instructive to observe in (18) that disagreement affects the evolution of relative
outlook. It is the primary driver of fluctuations in ηt . When gbt is large, ηt will also have large
fluctuations. Note, however, that even though dηt is zero when gbt = 0, ηt itself can take any
11

positive value and thus it still bears implications for the pricing of assets in the economy.

2.3

Equilibrium Pricing

To compute the equilibrium, we first write the optimization problem of each agent under
agent B’s probability measure PB . Since we have decided to work (without loss of generality) under PB , let us write from now on and for notational ease the following conditional
expectations operator
Et [·] ≡ EB [· | Ot ] .

(19)

The market is complete in equilibrium since under the observation filtration of both
agents there is a single source of risk. Consequently, we can solve the problem using the
martingale approach of Karatzas, Lehoczky, and Shreve (1987) and Cox and Huang (1989).13

The martingale approach transforms the dynamic consumption and portfolio choice problem into a

This assumption greatly simplifies the calculus. To the best of our knowledge, it has been first pointed
out in Yan (2008) and Dumas et al. (2009). If the coefficient of relative risk aversion is real, the computations
can still be performed using Newton’s generalized binomial theorem.

Proof. The proof mainly follows Dumas et al. (2009) and is provided in Appendix A.4. The
moment-generating function in Equation (21) is solved in Appendix A.5.
Equation (22) shows how the state-price density ξ B depends on the outlook variable η.
Since disagreement gb directly drives the volatility of the state-price density (as shown in
Equation 18), it follows from (22) that persistence in disagreement generates persistence in
the volatility of the state-price density. Therefore, even though in our model agents disagree
about a drift component, it directly impacts the diffusion of the state price density and
consequently all the equilibrium quantities.
The optimal share of consumption, stated in Equation (23), is exclusively driven by the
outlook variable η. If η tends to infinity, which means that agent A’s perception of the
economy is more likely than agent B’s perception15 , then agent A’s share of consumption
tends to one. Conversely, if η tends to zero, then ω(η) converges to zero. Unsurprisingly,
agent A’s consumption share increases with the likelihood of agent A’s probability measure
being true.
The single-dividend paying stock, expressed in Equation (21), consists in a weighted sum
of expectations, with weights characterized by the consumption share ω(·), which itself is
driven by the economic outlook η. It is instructive to study first the case α = 1 (log-utility
case), when the price of the single-dividend paying stock becomes

where Situ is the price of the asset in a hypothetical economy populated by only group i
agents. A similar aggregation result is provided by Xiong and Yan (2010). In contrast, when
the coefficient of relative risk aversion is greater than one, the aggregation must be adapted
to accomodate the additional intermediary terms (for j = 1, ..., α − 1) in the summation
(21). In fact, the summation has now α + 1 terms and the price of the single dividend paying

Since the binomial coefficients in (27) sum up to one, the price is therefore a weighted average
of α + 1 prices arising in representative agent economies populated by agents with relative
economic outlook η j/α . Hence, the outlook variable η not only affects the price valuation
through the expectations in (21), but also through the weights in the summation (27).
The weighted average form (27) highlights the origin of fluctuations in stock price volatility and the key role played by disagreement and the relative outlook η. The intuition is as
follows. The relative outlook η fluctuates in the presence of disagreement and causes investors to speculate against each other. This speculative activity generates fluctuations in
consumption shares: if the hypothetical investor j’s model is confirmed by the data, he or
she will consume more and thus his or her weight in the pricing formula (27) increases.
u
The price Stu will therefore approach Sjt
not only through the expectation but also through
changes in the relative weights. These fluctuations in relative weights further amplify the
impact of disagreement on the stock price.

Return Volatility and Trading Volume

We analyze the impact of model disagreement on the stock return volatility and trading volume. We show that economic outlook plays a pivotal role in generating excess volatility and
trading volume in financial markets. We then turn to the implications of model disagreement
and different economic outlook for the level, fluctuations, and persistence of volatility.

Proof. The diffusion of the state vector (ζ, fbB , gb, µ) is obtained from Equations (12), (13),
(15), and (18). Multiply these with Sζ /S = 1, Sf /S, Sg /S, and Sµ /S to obtain (29).
Equation (29) shows that the stock return diffusion σ consists in the standard Lucas
(1978) volatility σδ and three terms representing the long-run impact of changes in the estimated fundamental fbB (denoted by σf,lr ), the long-run impact of changes in the disagreement
gb (denoted by σg,lr ), and the instantaneous impact of changes in the disagreement gb (denoted
by σg,i ). Since we assume the volatility of the dividend σδ to be constant, the volatility of
the price-dividend ratio is exclusively driven by these last 3 terms. Therefore, all the following interpretations apply to both the stock return volatility and the volatility of the
price-dividend ratio.

3.1

Economic Outlook, Excess Volatility, and Trading Volume

We use a numerical example to show how model disagreement leads to excess volatility, even
when gb is currently zero. Specifically, we compare an economy populated by a representative
agent to one populated by two agents with model disagreement, when the two settings
are observationally equivalent in terms of their average expected growth rate and average
uncertainty. By shutting down the direct effect of disagreement, this exercise highlights the
key role played by differences in economic outlook in generating excess volatility.
The calibration is provided in Table 1. These parameters are adapted from Brennan
and Xia (2001) and Dumas et al. (2009), with a few differences. We choose lower values
for the volatility of the fundamental and the dividend growth volatility. For the preference
parameters, we choose a smaller coefficient of relative risk aversion and a positive subjective
discount rate.

Figure 2: Amplification of volatility through model disagreement
The graph compares stock volatility in two economies that are observationally equivalent
with respect to (i) uncertainty, (ii) average views of the agents on the growth rate, and
(iii) disagreement. The only difference between the economies is the existence of model
disagreement in one of them, case represented by the red dashed line. The blue solid line
thus depicts an observationally equivalent representative agent economy. Parameters are
provided in Table 1.

The mean-reversion speed chosen by agent B is 0.1, corresponding to a business cycle
half-life of approximately seven years. Agent B consequently believes in long-run risk. On
the other hand, agent A, who choses λA = 0.3, believes that the length of the business is
shorter with a perceived half-life of approximately two years. We assume that the true λ lies
somewhere in between λB and λA , and thus neither agent has a superior learning model.
Suppose now that in one economy a representative agent uses a mean-reversion parameter
λrep ∈ [0.1, 0.3]. Different levels of λrep result in different levels of uncertainty, denoted
hereafter γrep . As such, if the agent believes the growth rate of the economy to be persistent,
uncertainty is higher—due to the long-run risk effect—and thus volatility is higher. This
is reflected by the blue solid line in Figure 2. If the representative agent believes λrep to
be 0.3, then uncertainty takes the value γA . As λrep decreases, uncertainty rises up to γB ,
which is attained for λrep = 0.1. To keep it simple, we assume that the filtered growth rate
of the representative agent is fbrep = f¯. Figure 2 thus confirms the direct, positive, effect of
uncertainty on volatility in a representative agent economy.
Now, compare this to a second economy where there is model disagreement and assume
that there are equal consumption weights for the agents (i.e., ωA = ωB = 1/2) and equal
expected growth rates (i.e., fbrep = fbA = fbB = f¯). To make the comparison meaningful,
we keep the underlying uncertainty equal to the previous case, so that with λB = 0.1 and
λA ≥ 0.1, uncertainty in the representative agent economy equals the weighted average
16

uncertainty in the heterogeneous agent economy; that is, λA solves
γrep ≡ ωA γA + ωB γB .

(30)

We then compute the volatility that arises for all values of λA which solve (30) and with
λB = 0.1 fixed.
The red dashed line in Figure 2 shows that model disagreement amplifies volatility with
respect to a representative agent economy. This is meaningful because the two economies
are observationally equivalent. Indeed, (i) uncertainty is the same and equals γrep , (ii) the
average views of agents on the growth rate are the same and equal f¯, and (iii) disagreement
is the same and equals gb = 0. The only difference between these economies is the existence
of model disagreement, which presumably is not observable by the econometrician. But
this difference generate excess volatility through different economic outlooks—even if agents
agree today, they hold different economic outlooks about the future.16 Given this, it appears
that, through the different economic outlooks that it generates, model disagreement amplifies volatility beyond that observed in an observationally equivalent representative agent
economy.
Now, we consider how model disagreement affects trading volume in the economy. Trading volume represents the absolute value of the change in agents’ risky position. Measuring
trading volume is straightforward in discrete time. In continuous time, however, diffusion
processes have infinite variation. We therefore follow Xiong and Yan (2010) and proxy trading volume with the volatility of agents’ risky position changes.17 For this matter, picking
agent A or agent B gives the same measure of trading volume. In order to be consistent
with what has been done so far, we choose to focus on agent B.
The number of assets held by agent B, is given by the martingale representation theorem:
πB,t St σt =

∂VBt
σ(xt )
∂xt

(31)

where VBt is the wealth of agent B at time t (provided in Appendix A.4) and xt = (ζ fbB gb µ)
is the state vector of the economy. Equation (31) states that fluctuations in the price of
the risky asset, scaled by the number of assets held by agent B, are perfectly matched to
fluctuations in agent B’s wealth. In other words, the agent’s position in the risky asset is
set in such a way to replicate wealth fluctuations. Naming the term on the right hand side
16

Separate calculations show that volatility is further amplified with respect to the dashed red line when
gbt < 0 (i.e., when the long-term agent B is pessimistic) and remains almost unchanged with respect to the
dashed red line when gbt > 0 (i.e., when the long-term agent B is optimistic).
17
Trading actually occurs in discrete time and it is thus reasonable to measure changes in position across
small intervals (but finite). On average these changes increase with the volatility of investors’ risky position
changes.

Inspecting (33), the last term shows how disagreement directly moves trading volume. Of
course, it does enter indirectly as well through the partial derivatives, as do the other state
variables.
By the same train of thought as before, we assume that gb = 0 so we can compare
economies populated by two agents having model disagreement with those populated by
a representative agent. Table 2 describes the five distinct economies we analyze, which
are different with respect to the set of parameters (λA , λB ) considered. Severity of model
disagreement is measured by the distance between the parameters λA and λB . As such, two
of the economies feature moderate model disagreement (economies 2 and 4), one economy
features more severe model disagreement (economy 3), and the last two economies have a
representative agent (economies 1 and 5).
The last column of Table 2 shows that the level of trading volume increases with the
severity of model disagreement. Clearly, trading volume is zero in the representative agent
cases (economies 1 and 5). In between, agents take on speculative positions against each
other, which increases trading volume. These results also show that investors change their
positions even though disagreement today is zero, i.e., gb = 0. They do so because they know
that their underlying models are different and thus they have different economic outlooks.
Once again, the key variable in generating trading volume is not disagreement per se, but
the relative economic outlook.

3.2

Characteristics of Volatility

We turn now to the analysis of the characteristics of stock return volatility. We highlight the
key role played by the relative outlook variable η in the propagation of disagreement shocks
to volatility shocks. We then show that, while the level of volatility is mostly driven by
long-run risk as in Bansal and Yaron (2004), both the variation and persistence of volatility
are driven by disagreement.
3.2.1

Level and Variation of Volatility

Coming back to Proposition 4, a direct analysis of the stock diffusion formula (29) is obscured
by the presence of the partial derivatives Sf , Sg , and Sµ . These derivatives depend on the
state variables themselves and thus are time-varying. In order to gain more intuition and to
understand which terms drive the level of volatility and which ones drive its fluctuations, we
simulate the last three terms in Equation (29). Simulations are done at weekly frequency
for 100 years. Figure 3 illustrates one simulated path of the stock return diffusion and its
components. The significant driver of changes in stock market volatility is the fourth term
in Equation (29), σg,i , whereas terms representing long-run changes in disagreement, σg,lr ,
and long-run changes in the estimated fundamental, σf,lr , are slightly time-varying but have
less significant impact on the dynamics of volatility.
The fourth term in Equation (29) is therefore key to understanding the impact of disagreement on stock return volatility. This term consists in the partial derivative of the stock
price with respect to the relative outlook variable η multiplied by the volatility of η, which
itself is directly driven by disagreement (according to 18). Both disagreement and economic
outlook therefore play a role in driving volatility, by the following mechanism. When agents
are in disagreement, they hold different economic outlooks and thus the stock price fluctuates
in order to accommodate speculative trading by both agents. Higher disagreement generates
large fluctuations in economic outlook (according to 18) and thus large changes in the stock
price. One can therefore say that disagreement drives the volatility of stock returns through
changes in the relative economic outlook.
To disentangle the role played by disagreement from the role played by the relative
economic outlook, we plot in the left panel of Figure 4 the fourth diffusion component σg,i
and the disagreement gb. The correlation coefficient between the two lines in this particular
example yields a value of 0.95. In the right pannel of Figure 4 we plot the distribution of
the correlation between the diffusion term and disagreement for 1,000 simulations and we
find that the coefficient stays mainly between 0.8 and 1. It is therefore disagreement which
drives the fluctuations in σg,i , whereas the relative economic outlook is the primary channel
through which these fluctuations are transmitted to stock market volatility.

Figure 3: Stock return diffusion and its components
One simulated path (100 years) of the stock return diffusion and its components. Simulations
are performed at weekly frequency, but lines are plotted at quarterly frequency to avoid
graph cluttering. The diffusion components σf,lr , σg,lr , and σg,i are defined in Equation
(29). The calibration is provided in Table 1.

We examine whether the dynamics illustrated on Figure 3 are particular to one simulation.
To this end, we plot in Figures 5 and 6 the distributions of the averages and variances of
σf,lr , σg,lr , and σg,i . Averages and variances are computed over the length of each simulation
which is chosen to be 100 years at weekly frequency.
Figure 5 shows that the diffusion components σg,lr and σg,i do not have a significant
impact on the level of volatility. The level of volatility is primarily determined by the fbB term defined by σf,lr . It is worth mentioning that the fbB -term is negative because in our
model the precautionary savings effect dominates the substitution effect. Indeed, a positive
shock in the fundamental increases future consumption. Because agents want to smooth
consumption over time, they increase their current consumption and so reduce their current
investment. This tendency to disinvest outweighs the substitution effect (which pushes
investors to invest more) and implies a drop in prices as long as agents are sufficiently
risk averse (α > 1). Hence the stock return diffusion component determined by changes
in the fundamental, σf,lr , is negative. The smaller the mean-reversion speed λB , the more
negative the σf,lr component, and consequently the larger stock return volatility becomes.
The reason is that a small mean-reversion speed implies a significant amount of long-run

risk and therefore the stock price is very sensitive to movements in the fundamental, as in
Bansal and Yaron (2004).
We try now to understand which components drive the variability of stock return diffusion. This is shown in Figure 6, which depicts the variances of the diffusion components and
confirms the conclusions drawn from the example depicted in Figure 3. Variations incurred
by the stock return diffusion are almost exclusively generated by variations in the third and

fourth diffusion terms, σg,lr and σg,i , which are both driven by disagreement. Indeed, variations in σf,lr are relatively small. We can therefore conclude that the level of the volatility is
mainly driven by the persistence of the expected consumption growth, whereas fluctuations
in volatility are driven by differences of beliefs regarding the persistence of the expected
consumption growth.
3.2.2

Persistence of Volatility

We turn now to the time-varying properties of volatility and address the question whether
the fluctuations in volatility generated by disagreement are persistent. Indeed, stock return
volatility clusters in our model because of the following mechanism. As shown in Proposition
1, disagreement gb mean-reverts to a stochastic mean driven by fbB . Because one of the agents
(in this case agent B) believes the fundamental is persistent, agent B’s estimation of the
fundamental fbB is persistent and so becomes the disagreement. Given that the disagreement
enters the diffusion of state-price density through the outlook variable η (see Proposition
2) and then enters volatility through the last component in Equation (29), stock return
volatility clusters. This mechanism, new to our knowledge, shows how persistence in the
fundamental (a component of the drift) can transmute into the diffusion of stock return and
generate volatility clustering.
To provide evidence that persistent disagreement indeed implies GARCH-type dynamics,
we simulate 1,000 paths of stock returns over a 100 years horizon at weekly frequency. For
each simulated path we compute the demeaned returns, , by extracting the residuals of the

Figure 7 illustrates the distribution of the ARCH parameter β1 and the GARCH parameter β2 . Their associated t-stats range between 6 and 11 for the ARCH parameter and between
150 and 350 for the GARCH parameter. First, the large t-stats suggest that the estimated
parameters are significant. Second, the values of β1 , β2 , and in particular their sum show
that stock return volatility clusters and is close to be integrated. That is, the model implied
volatility clusters because its main driver—the disagreement among agents—is persistent.
3.2.3

Volatility Clustering in Alternative Theoretical Models

We conclude this section with two questions. First, can a single agent framework generate
volatility clustering? Second, if agents’s difference of beliefs is generated by overconfidence
instead of disagreement (Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003; Dumas et al., 2009), can we also
observe volatility clustering?
To address the first question, we observe that in a single agent model the last two terms
23

in Equation (29) disappear and volatility depends only on σδ and σf,lr . The analysis above
indicates that this second term does not move significantly. Therefore, without disagreement
there are no significant fluctuations in volatility and thus single agent models have difficulties
in generating volatility clustering.
Turning now to the second question, Proposition 1 shows that disagreement mean-reverts
around a persistent fbB and thus itself becomes persistent. In contrast, disagreement generated by overconfidence, as in Dumas et al. (2009), is not easily persistent, even though both
agents would be long-term believers. The reason is that disagreement mean-reverts around
zero with a parameter equal to λ + γ/σδ2 (see Lemma 2 in Dumas et al. 2009). Because of
the second term, this parameter is large under usual calibrations, which is not enough to
generate persistent dynamics.
On a final note, in Appendix A.6, Table 6, we perform a robustness analysis which
further confirms the role played by disagreement for generating persistence and fluctuations
in volatility. The analysis consists in comparing the properties of the model implied volatility
for different calibrations. Consistent with our theoretical results, we find that strong longrun risk increases the average level of volatility, while severe disagreement increases both the
variation and the persistence of volatility.

4

Survival

In our model we make the assumption that the fundamental is unobservable. It is consequently reasonable to assume that both investors have different beliefs regarding the dynamics of an unobservable process. Furthermore, it would be arbitrary and non-realistic
to assume that one of the two agents has the correct beliefs i.e. the right model in mind.
This raises two questions: what is the true data-generating process and how long do agents
survive given this true data-generating process? This section is devoted to a discussion of
these two questions.
In order to investigate how long each agent survives, we have to assume a realistic datagenerating process in the sense that it has to be consistent with agents beliefs. Indeed,
although both agents might realistically have wrong beliefs, they agents are not too far from
the truth. Therefore, we assume that the true data-generating process is

Table 3: Mean-reversion speed and length of the business cycle

To investigate the speed at which agent A or agent B disappears from the economy,
we follow Yan (2008) and compute the P-expectation of the consumption share of agent A.
To this end we first simulate the dividend process using the true data-generating process
provided in (37) and (38). Then, we perform each agent’s learning exercise and we compute
the expectation of the consumption share of agent A, ω(ηT ), for T ranging from 0 to 1, 000
years.
Figure 8 depicts the P-expectation (i.e., under the true probability measure) of the consumption share of agent A over 1,000 years. This expected consumption share slightly
decreases on average. Investors who believe in long-run risk are expected to save more and
thus have a lower survival index (Yan, 2008). Nevertheless, Figure 8 shows that both shares
of consumption remain very close to each other and that both agents survive for more than
1,000 years. This is also consistent with Yan (2008). We conclude therefore that the type of
disagreement considered here is economically important over long horizons.

Conclusion

We consider a theoretical framework in which two agents interpret information using different
economic models of the economy. Specifically, in our setup agents disagree on the length of
the business cycle. We analyze the asset pricing implications of such disagreement.
We first show that the disagreement is strongly persistent, affects the volatility of the
stochastic discount factor and consequently impacts the stock return volatility. Disagreement
generates different expectations of future economic variables, or different economic outlooks,
which further amplify the return volatility and the trading volume. We decompose the
dynamics of volatility and show that disagreement is the main driver of volatility fluctuations,
while the absolute level of volatility is driven primarily by long-run risk. We thus provide a
theoretical foundation of the GARCH-like behavior of stock returns.
Several questions are the subject of our ongoing research. First, we assume that investors
do not change their economic models. It is important to understand how our results would
change if agents were to perform the full learning exercise. Our expectation is that investors’
estimates should end up close to the true model only after a very long time. Indeed, an
accurate estimator of the mean-reversion speed of a relatively persistent process requires
a large sample of data. In addition, the large set of plausible models governing the real
economy makes it virtually impossible for the agents to end up in agreement.
The learning uncertainty is by construction constant in our setup. This is because we do
not consider here any additional news (newspapers, quarterly reports, economic data, and so
on). In a setting with additional news and in which investors’ attention to news is fluctuating,
uncertainty will fluctuate. Our conjecture is that spikes in attention will exacerbate the
disagreement among agents, further amplifying the effects on volatility described in this
paper. It is therefore important to study the synergistic relationships between attention,
uncertainty, and disagreement and their impact on asset prices.
Finally, our model generates a term structure of disagreement whose shape is governed by
the difference between the mean-reversion parameters. Empirically observed term structures
of disagreement (as in Patton and Timmermann (2010) or Andrade et al. (2014)) can therefore help estimating the magnitude of the difference between these parameters. The term
structure of disagreement should also have implications on the pricing of firms with different
characteristics and probably explain well-known anomalies such as the value premium.

We simulate dividend data at quarterly frequency over a 50-year horizon18 using the true datagenerating process defined in Equations (39) and (40) and the parameters provided in Table 4.

random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.
Although agents have the same information at hand, we assume that they use different econometrics techniques to perform their estimation exercise. Agent A estimates the unobservable fundamental and the parameters by applying the Kalman filter together with Maximum-Likelihood
(Hamilton, 1994), while agent B applies the particle filtering algorithm presented in Liu and West
(2001).19
Table 5 shows that agent A and B obtain parameter estimates of the dividend volatility σδ , the
long-term mean of the fundamental f¯, and the volatility of the fundamental σf that are relatively
close to each other. Their estimation of the mean-reversion speed λ, however, differs significantly
from one another. Indeed, the absolute difference between the mean-reversion speed estimated by
agent A and that estimated by agent B is worth 0.1742. Relative to the true value of the parameter,
the difference in the estimated mean-reversion speeds is about 87%, whereas it is less than 25%
for all other parameters. Therefore, this calibration exercise motivates, first, our assumption to
consider heterogeneity in mean-reversion speeds only and, second, our choice to consider meanreversion speeds such that |λA − λB | = 0.2.
18

The frequency and horizon considered match those of the Real GDP growth time-series available on the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s website.

We would like to thank Arthur Korteweg and Michael Rockinger for providing us with various particle
filtering codes. The particle filtering algorithm of Liu and West (2001) estimates, at each point in time, the
unobservable fundamental and the parameters of the model.

where the posterior variance γAt solves the ODE
γ̇At = a1 γAt + γAt a01 + bob − (boB + γAt A01 )(BoB)−1 (boB + γAt A01 )0 .

Assuming that we are at the steady-state yields
a1 γAt + γAt a01 + bob − (boB + γAt A01 )(BoB)−1 (boB + γAt A01 )0 = 0.

State Vector and Transform Analysis

Finding the equilibrium price boils down to computing the following expectation:

Et ηuα δu1−α = Et e(1−α 0 0 j/α 0 0 0)X ,

(91)

where we define the augmented vector of state variables X by

X = ζ fbB gb µ gb2 gbfbB fbB2

(92)

In Equation (92), ζ represents the log aggregate consumption (ζ ≡ ln δ), whereas µ represents
the log relative outlook (µ ≡ ln η). Observe that the vector of state variables (initially four)
has been augmented by adding three quadratic and cross-product terms. By doing so, the initially
affine-quadratic vector (ζ, fbB , gb, µ)> is transformed into the affine vector X (see Cheng and Scaillet,
2007). It follows that the expectation in Equation (91) is the moment-generating function of an
affine vector and thus we can apply the theory of affine processes (Duffie, Pan, and Singleton, 2000)
to compute this quantity, which becomes

Robustness Analysis

Table 6 confirms that disagreement and long-run risk have different impacts on stock-return volatility. Indeed, an increase in long-run risk increases the average level of volatility (Bansal and Yaron,
2004), while an increase in disagreement increases both the variation of volatility and the persistence
of volatility.

Table 6: Properties of volatility for various calibrations
This table presents the mean, minimum, maximum, volatility, and persistence of volatility
in five different models. Persistence is calculated as the sum of the parameters β1 and β2
in the GARCH(1,1) estimation. In bold is the benchmark model considered throughout the
paper. Numbers reported above are (annualized) averages computed over 1,000 simulations
of weekly data over a 100-year horizon.
