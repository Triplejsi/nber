Comparing the Global Performance of Alternative Exchange Arrangements

ABSTRACT

The volatility of the world economy since the breakdown of the Bretton
Woods par value system of exchange rates has led many pol-icymakers and

economists to call for reform of the international monetary system. Many
critics of the current "non—system" call for tighter international rules of
the game in macroeconomic policy making. The proposed systems cover a wide
spectrum of measures including maintaining the current flexible exchange rate
system but with increased consultations between the major economies; a "target
zone " system as advocated by John Williamson; or a full return to a system of

fixed exchange rates as advocated by Ronald McKinnon
This paper presents and applies a methodology useful for studying the
operating characteristics of a number of alternative monetary arrangements using

a large-scale simulation model of the world economy. We consider the
performance of the regimes when policymakers do or do not observe the shocks,
and when policymakers infer the shocks using an optimal filtering rule.
Although the results are model specific and at best illustrative of the issues
involved, the approach does have the advantage of providing a richer framework
of analysis than is possible in simple models of international interdependence.

Introduction

The volatility of the world economy since the breakdown of the Bretton
Woods par value system of exchange rates has led many policymakers and

economists to call for reform of the international monetary system. Many
critics of the current "non-system" call for tighter international rules of
the game in macroeconomic policy making1. The proposed systems cover a wide
spectrum of measures including maintaining the current flexible exchange rate
system but with increased consultations between the major economies; a "target
zone " system as advocated by Williamson (1985) and Roosa (1984); or a full

return to a system of fixed exchange rates as advocated by McKinnon (1984).
This paper presents and applies a methodology useful for studying the
operating characteristics of a number of alternative monetary arrangements

using a large-scale simulation model of the world economy. The model
developed in Sachs and McKibb-in (1985) and McKibbin and Sachs (1986) is

attractive for policy analysis because of several desirable features,
including rational expectations in the asset markets, and careful

specification of stock-flow and long-term growth relations. Using a numerical
technique described below, we examine the asymptotic variances of key
macroeconomic target variables for a range of stochastic disturbances, and

under a variety of exchange regimes. We consider the outcomes when policymakers
do or do not observe the shocks, and when policymakers infer the shocks using an

optimal filtering rule. Although the results are model specific and at best
i11utrative of the issues involved, the approach does have the advantage of

characteristics of this so-called non-system.

providing a richer framework of analysis than is possible in simple models of
international interdependence.

The McKibb-in-Sachs Global (MSG) model, which provides the framework for
the analysis, is summarized -in Section II.

In Section III we discuss a

methodology which -is useful for analysing the performance of alternative rules
under different assumptions about the observab-ility of shocks hitting the

world economy. Section IV contains a discussion of the regimes that we
investigate including the practical implementation of these regimes.

ifl

Section V the simulation results are examined. Conclusions are contained in
Section VI.

II. The MSG Model

The MSG model was developed in Sachs and McK-ibb-in (1985). The reader is

also referred to recent papers by Ishii, McKibbin and Sachs (1985), McKibbin

and Sachs (1986) and Sachs (1985) for several applications of the model. The
MSG model is a general equilibrium macroeconomic model of the world economy.
A detailed description of the model can be found -in Sachs and McKibb-in (1985).

Here we briefly summarize some of the main features of the model.
The world economy is divided into five regions consisting of the U.S.,
Japan, the rest of the OECD (hereafter ROECO), OPEC and the developing

countries. The regions are linked via flows of goods and assets. Stock-flow
relationships and -intertemporal budget constraints are carefully observed.

Budget deficits cumulate into a stock of government debt which must eventually
be financed, while current account deficits cumulate into a stock of foreign

—3—

debt. Asset markets are forward looking so exchange rates and long-term
interest rates are conditioned by the expected future path of policy, as
governed by alternative policy rules.

The internal macroeconomic structure of the three industrialized regions of
the U.S., ROECO and Japan is modelled, while the OPEC and developing country
regions have only their foreign trade and financial structures incorporated.

Each region produces a good which is an imperfect substitute in the consumption
basket of each other region, where the consumption of each good depends on

income and relative prices. Private absorption depends positively on wealth,

disposable income and negatively on long and short term ex ante real interest
rates, along conventional lines. Wages are predetermined in each period, with
the nominal wage change across periods a function of consumer price inflation,

the output gap and the change in the output gap. With the assumption that the
GOP deflator is a fixed markup over wages, we derive a standard Phillips curve.
Residents in different countries hold their own country's assets as well as
foreign assets (except foreign money) based on the relative expected rates of

return. Money demand is assumed to be determined by transactions motives, so
that real balances are a function of real income, nominal interest rates and
lagged money balances.

Trade shares and initial asset stocks are based on actual data for 1983.
Behavioral parameters are chosen based on our interpretation of the empirical

literature. A sensitivity analysis of the selected parameters is not
incorporated in this paper although it is under investigation.
We have analyzed both non-linear and linearized versions of the model,

and have found that the two versions have very similar properties. In the

work presented here, we use the linear version, primarily because our

implementation of dynamic game theory requires the linearized model. The
model -is simulated using numerical techniques which take into account the

forward-looking variables in the model. The technique we use is discussed -in
detail below.

III. Methodology for Analysing Exchange Regimes

There are several ways to analyze the properties of exchange regimes.

One way is to analyze the short-run dynamic adjustment to various shocks. An
alternative is to follow the approach in Taylor (1985) -in which the average

operating characteristics of the global economy are analyzed by calculating
the stochastic steady state variances of a set of targets given a set of

stochastic shocks to the system. The variance measures can then be examined
and, given a utility function, the performance of the rules can be analyzed.

We follow the second of these approaches in this paper. In addition we
provide a summary measure of the performance of each regime using a welfare

function. We do not totally avoid the problem of having to select an arbitrary
welfare function because in deriving the rules for some regimes we assume that
the authorities follow optimizing behavior according to a specific welfare

function. This part of the analysis seems to be unavoidable.

This section is divided into two parts. The first explains our procedures
for deriving a set of rules in a model with forward-looking agents.
The second part discusses the methodology used to analyze the stochastic
properties of alternative regimes.

such as the exchange rates and long term interest rate;

-is the expectation taken at time t of the jumping variables at

time t+1 based on information available at time t

We make several assumptions about the stochastic disturbances. They all

enter additively so that certainty equivalence holds. All shocks are
temporary although the model dynamics make the effects of the shocks

persistent. Where the model dynamics do not add much persistence to
particular shocks, as is the case with shocks to portfolio preferences and
aggregate demand, we assume that the shocks follow an AR1 process of the
following form:

-6-

+

=

The autoregressive shocks (J.L) are then added to the vector of state variables.
Note that shocks to prices and money demand inherently have persistent effects
in the model, because the price shocks get built into a wage-price spiral,
while the structural money demand relationship is specified with a lagged
adjustment process.

The shocks also satisfy the following conditions:

t_i(t)

t_i(€tEt) = E

We use three alternative procedures to select possible rules for the policy

variables, hereafter referred to as control variables (U). In the first
procedure we assume that each country chooses its control variables to maximize
an intertemporal utility function, taking as given the reactions of the other

countries and given the structure of the model. The second procedure is similar
to the first except we assume that a global planner undertakes the optimization,
in order to maximize a weighted average of the utility functions of the

individual countries. In the third procedure we directly specify an explicit
policy rule which is not derived from an explicit optimization problem.

Consider the first procedure in which countries optimize individually. The
outcome of this is a familiar Nash equilibrium of a dynamic, linear-quadratic

game. The welfare function is specified as:

(5)

w =
{w1(Tit)2 + w2(T2t)2

is

the social rate of time discount;

is a weight on target i;

ia a diagonal matrix with each w on the diagonal;

T1 15 target 1.

The targets are assumed to be macroeconomic targets such as the output gap,
inflation, current account, budget deficit, nominal income or the nominal

-8W-

exchange rate. The specific targets depend on the regime we are simulating.
The rule we find is optimal for the given country (in that it minimizes the
dynamic social loss function), taking as given the rules that are being
employed in the other regions.

A direct application of optimal control techniques could be used to solve
this policy optimization problem. As is well known, under optimal control
techniques, the policymaker at time zero is assumed to choose the complete path

of policy instruments at the time of the initial optimization. However, as
pointed out by Kydland and Prescott (1977), the optimal policy rules will not in

general be time consistent. Future governments will not find it optimal to
follow the same policies as envisioned by earlier governments. Instead, we look
for a time consistent policy rule, that is, a rule that is optimal, taking as

given that the same rule will be followed by future governments. The time
consistent solution will yield a different path for the policy instruments than
does a direct application of optimal control techniques.

The problem that we solve can be written formally as follows. Consider a
single controller in the simplest case of no exogenous variables or stochastic

shocks (in order to avoid unnecessary complexity). The structure, from (1) -

is thus:

subject to the constraint

of time consistency.

We search for a solution of the following form. We are looking for a
time-invariant policy rule Ut =

a quadratic value function Vt =

a matrix linking e to X of the form e =

XSX,

I-I1X, such that I', S. Ht have the

is the stable manifold of the

difference equation system (1'), (2') when Ut =

rx.

In words, we are looking for a time-invariant rule Ut =

rx

linking

the policy instruments to the states. This rule is optimal taking as given that
the same rule will be applied in the future. Given this rule, there is a

corresponding matrix S such that XSX =

- t0tTT.

Thus, XSX is the

value of the objective function following the policy rule Ut

I'X. Third,

given the dynamic model of the economy, and the policy rule Ut =

FX,

the

jumping variables must lie on a stable manifold given by e =

For the case of many controllers, the conditions can be rewritten with
country subscripts and the additional constraint that each controller takes as

given the policy rules of the other controllers. The inclusion of exogenous

—10--

variables and stochastic shocks is straightforward. With exogenous variables
and stochastic shocks included, the solution is a set of rules for the control

variables of the form (see (AlO) n appendix A):

Ut =

fiXt

+

f2Et

+ cit

+

and a set of rules for the jumping variables such that the model solution is on
the unique stable manifold (see (A12) in appendix A):

e = HiX

+

H2Et

+

H3c

+

C2

Note that C1 and C2 are intercept terms (shifting over time) that depend on
the time path of the exogenous variables.

In general, it is not possible to find closed—form analytical solutions for

F, S, and H1 (in the muiticontroller game, we look for F, S, and H1 for each
of the countries i).

In our study we employ the technique of numerical dynamic

programming for linear quadratic systems, as in Oudiz and Sachs (1985) and

Currie and Levine (1985a). The details of the solution method, which rely
basically on a backward recursion procedure, are provided in Appendix A.

Another procedure that we use for calculating policy rules is similar to

the first. Instead of assuming that each policymaker maximizes a
country-specific objective function, we assume that a single, global planner

chooses policy rules for each region to maximize a welfare function that is a

weighted sum of the welfare functions of the individual countries. As many
authors have shown (e.g. see Sachs and McKibbin (1985)), this cooperative

solution may avoid the inefficiencies of the Nash equilibrium found by assuming
that each each country chooses its policy rules non--cooperatively.

—11—

It is useful to identify "candidates" for policy rules by maximizing an

explicit objective function. However, many rules are asserted to be "good" or
"robust" without reference to a particular objective function. Thus, in
addition to choosing rules through formal dynamic programming procedures, we

also directly specify some rules linking Ut and X, using suggestions from the
policy literature. Thus, we study choices for f that:

(1) fix exchange rates

across countries; (2) stabilize nominal GOP; etc. Even though such rules do not
expressly maximize a given objective function, they are often asserted to be

desirable, and are therefore worthy of our attention. Note that once we have
specified a rule f, we must use (1) and (2) to find a stable manifold for the
jumping variables et.

B.

Analyzing the Stochastic Properties of Alternative Regimes
In this section we explore the implications of the observability of shocks

and describe the procedures followed to calculate the variance of target

variables in a stochastic steady state. We incorporate stochastic shocks to
the equations for aggregate demand, prices, money demand, and portfolio

preferences in the U.S., Japan and ROECD. There are 12 shocks in total.

1.

Shocks Observed

First consider the procedures used to calculate the variances of the

targets when the shocks are observed. A complete derivation is given in
Appendix A. The key point is that any rule which is chosen is converted into
the form:

(6)

Ut =

fiXt

+

f2Et

+

f3e

+

C1.

—12—

Note that since the shocks are "observed" prior to setting the policies, the

control variables depend explicitly on the shocks. We also find the
corresponding stable manifold for the jumping variables:

e = H1Xt

(7)

+

H2Et

+

H3ct

+

C2

We can now find the target variables as a function of the states, the exogenous

variables, and the stochastic shocks. Using a procedure set out in Appendix A,
section 2 we are able to find the variance of the target variables as a function
of the variance—covariance matrix of the shocks.

2.

Shocks Unobserved When Policy is Selected

When the shocks are unobserved at the time of selecting the control

variables, we set r3 in (6) to zero. Note that H3 will still be non-zero
because the shocks will affect the jumping variables despite the lack of any

policy response. This can be seen from equation (All) in Appendix A. In the
case of unobserved shocks, equations (6) and (7) would become (using notation
from appendix A):

u = r'1x
e = (J

We can then use the procedures described in Appendix A for the case of observed
shocks, to calculate the variances of the target variables.

AFilterin9 Approach When Shocks are Unobserved

A common prescription for policy setting in a stochastic environment is
for policymakers to follow a rule which links policy to a set of
contemporaneously observed variables, or intermediate targets in an attempt to

reach ultimate objectives. We formalize this approach in this section.
Consider the case in which the conditional var-iance-covarjance matrix of a set

of shocks is known but in any period the policymaker cannot directly observe
the shocks hitting the system. The approach which we develop here -is to observe
several variables and infer the underlying nature of the shocks by an optimal
Kalmari filtering rule (see Sargent (1979), p.209 for an illustration of this
process).

The procedure we develop here is completely general, though we illustrate

it in this paper for a single special case. We assume that the monetary
authorities observe the exchange rate and decide on monetary policy based on
this observation as well as knowledge of the underlying model and the properties

of the underlying shocks. This gives a rule linking monetary policy to the
exchange rate which will indicate whether the authorities should optimally "lean
with the wind" or "lean against the wind" (i.e. whether a monetary contraction
or expansion should follow an observed appreciation of the currency).
To make the procedure a little more transparent, -it -is worth considering a

simple example first. Let Mt be an observed variable related to two underlying
shocks in the following way (dropping time subscripts for convenience):

M =

a1c1

where

a =

Suppose that M is observed, but that €1 and

We can now find t(ctIMt) = y Mt =

where )' =

Thus, we can describe the expectations of the shocks conditional on the
observation of M. Now let us turn to the multidimensional case. Suppose that
at any time t, a set of observed variables M is related to the states, lagged

states, jumping variables, control variables, exogenous variables, and the
unobserved shocks in the following way:

Mt =

-15-

Using the same backward recursion technique as outlined in Section lILA, above,
we can find a set of rules for U where, in this case, the rules will be a
function not of the actual shocks, but of their expectation (i.e. projection)
given Mt:

Compare (9) with (6). Because of the linearity of the model and the
additivity of the disturbances, we can appeal to certainty equivalence to show

that the coefficients r1, r, and

The policy rules can be stated in a number of different ways. In (9) we
stated the rule for the control variables as a function of the state variables

and the expectation of the shock conditional on M. We can also state the rule
as a function of the shocks themselves or as a function of the vector of

observed variables. Equation (12) can be substituted into (9) and (10) to find
new rules for the control and jumping variables as a function of the underlying
shocks:

Given these new rules for the control variables and the jumping variables we
can proceed to calculate the variance of the targets by using the same
procedures outlined above.

IV. Design and Implementation of Monetary Regimes

We can now use the methodology developed in Sect-ion III to examine the

performance of alternative monetary regimes. Before turning to the specific
rules, we make some general observations about alternative monetary regimes.
The large literature that has emerged from the debate about fixed versus
flexible exchange rates has produced several helpful insights on choosing a

monetary regime. In the simple theoretical models generally used, it is found
that the appropriateness of any monetary regime depends on the nature of the

shocks impinging on the economy. For example, in a Mundell-Fleming world with

—18--

capital mobility, if the shocks to the domestic economy are in the money demand
equation, then a fixed exchange rate will dissipate the shock to the rest of the

world and be beneficial to the domestic economy. If shocks emanate from the
real economy, then a flexible exchange rate will generally assist in dampening

the effects of the shocks on the domestic economy. If foreign price level
shocks are the main source of disturbance, then a flexible exchange rate is

better for insulating the domestic economy; and if the foreign shocks are shifts
in demand for the home good, a flexible exchange rate is better. A second set

of issues involves the incentive effects of any regime. Problems of
beggar-thy—neighbor policies can emerge under flexible exchange rates where
countries think they can manipulate a bilateral exchange rate to gain some

advantage (see Sachs and Oudiz (1985)). A fixed exchange rate regime may
provide a constraint on national policymakers to prevent beggar-thy-neighbor
policies.

The case for return to more managed exchange rates is examined in more

detail in Sachs (1985b) and Obstfeld (1985). The case for exchange rate rules
is quite attractive and includes arguments about increased predictability of

national authorities and preventing beggar-thy-neighbour behavior. These gains
must be balanced, however, against the argument that a set of international
rules can lead all participants to make the same mistakes on a global scale.
Our study focuses on regimes for monetary policy rather than regimes for
both monetary and fiscal policies. With two, policy instruments the analysis of
strategic interactions becomes more complex, as shown in McK-ibbin and Sachs

(1986). We consider seven alternative monetary regimes in this paper under
various assumptions about the observability of the shocks.
We define a regime as money supply rule for each region in the form

—19—

U. =

i

where

r ii.xt + r2i.E t

+

r 3i.€ t

+c

lit

U -is a vector of control variables for country i (in this case containing

the money supply).

(1) Pure Float
Our first case, a pure floating exchange rate, is an obvious base case to

choose. In this case, the money supplies in the various regions are held fixed,
and do not respond to exogenous shocks or changes in the state variables.

(2) Noncooperation
A model such as the MSG model is particularly useful for analyzing the

problems of beggar-thy-neighbor policies. This is done in the second regime
in which we specify a social welfare function for each of the three OECD

regions. Social welfare in each region is specified as a function of various
macroeconomic targets, such as the inflation rates, the GOP gap, the current

account deficit, and the budget deficit. The social welfare functions are made
intertemporal, by assuming that the level of social welfare depends on the
discounted values of the targets in the current and all future periods.
The specific form of the social welfare function that we employ is quadratic,
as follows:

W =

(18)

12

+

1T + O.5CA

+

where: W is the level of social welfare,

Q

is

the GDP gap,

it is the CPI inflation rate,

CA is the current account-GDP ratio,

o.1D]

—20-

O is the domestic budget deficit-GOP ratio,
o

is

the social rate of time discount.

Clearly, macroeconomic "bliss" is achieved when the GOP gap is zero, CPI
inflation is zero, the current account is in balance, and the budget is in
balance.

Using the techniques discussed in Section III, we calculate a set of
monetary policy rules in the three OECO regions that have the following

"equilibrium" property: each set of rules is optimal for the given country
(in that it minimizes the dynamic social loss function), taking as given the

rules that are being employed in the other regions. We have shown elsewhere
(see Sachs and McKibbin (1985)) that such an equilibrium does not necessarily

yield very attractive outcomes. These rules will likely contain some types of
beggar-thy-neighbor policies, and will therefore show some of the disadvantages

of the classic prisoners' dilemma. For example, Oudiz and Sachs (1985) have
shown that the equilibrium rules are likely to produce excessively tight
monetary policies and high real interest rates in an inflationary environment.

(3) Cooperation
It is very likely the case that the social welfare of all of the
countries can be enhanced by a different set of policies, that provides for

cooperatively selected rules of the game. We can find such a set of rules
by assuming that a single "world" planner maximizes a single social welfare
function, which is a weighted average of the social welfare functions of the

U.S., Japan, and the ROECO. With some arbitrariness, we select these weights to
be GNP shares. The result of this global optimization is a new set of rules
that avoids the problem of beggar-thy-neighbor policies.

An alternative regime that is frequently proposed is to target a measure

of nominal GOP. We implement this rule by assuming that each of the OECD
regions choose monetary policy non-cooperatively to minimize the variance of
its own nominal GOP, taking as given the rules of the other countries.

Exchange

rates are left free to fluctuate. This is the fourth and final of the floating
exchange rate regimes that we consider.

(5) McKinnon Rule
We now come to the regimes of fixed exchange rates. Of course, saying that
a regime has fixed exchange rates does not completely specify the monetary
arrangements of the regime because there are many ways of allocating the
responsibility across the countries for keeping the exchange rates constant.
The first case we consider is that proposed by Ronald McKinnon (1984). Under
the McKinnon rule, exchange rates within the OECD region are held fixed with an
additional constraint that a weighted average of the OECD nominal money stocks
remains fixed (or has a fixed, low rate of growth).
(6)

obal Nominal GDP Targeting
The second fixed exchange rate regime is the global nominal GOP

targeting regime. In this regime we find a set of money supply rules for
each of the three regions which:

(a) fixes the cross-exchange rates; and

(b) fixes the expected nominal GDP of the world economy. The operational
difference of this rule and the McKinnon rule can be best understood with

respect to particular shocks. Suppose a pure velocity shock occurs in the
U.S., which reduces the demand for U.S. money for several periods. In the
McK-innon plan, the world stock of money would remain constant, but the U.S.

—22—

money stock would decline while the money supplies in the rest of the OECO
would increase (these shifts would be necessary to keep the exchange rate

fixed). On balance, an excess supply of money, at initial interest rates and
pr-ices, would develop in the world economy. The result would be an increase in

world output and eventually in prices. Under the nominal GOP targetting plan,
however, the fall -in U.S. money demand will be fully compensated by a

fall in the U.S. money supply. There will be no need for a sustained period
of higher output or prices. The key distinction is that the GOP targetting
rule does not require that the global money stock remains fixed.

(7) Leaning With or Against the Wind
Neither the cooperative rules nor the non-cooperative rules are likely to

produce purely fixed exchange rates as the first best optimum. However, the
rules that do emerge are likely to be too complex for actual implementation.
An alternative set of rules may be easy to implement, although they do not

perform as well as the optimum rules. One such set of proposals has been called
"leaning with the wind" or "leaning against the wind." This is implemented in
this paper as the third technique outlined in Section III. We assume that
policymakers know the variance—covariance matrix of a range of shocks, although

the specific realization of the shocks in any period is not observed. The
authorities in each region maximize a welfare function of the form given in

equation (5') and are assumed to infer the realization of any shocks by

observing movements in the exchange rate. They then apply an optimal rule to
determine the expected value of each shock and adjust policy accordingly. The
rules which arise from this regime depend crucially on the variance—covariance
matrix of the shocks.

—23—

An exhaustive analysis of the seven different rules would require the
study of many types of shocks, with alternative assumptions about their

variances and covariances. In this preliminary study, we consider twelve
temporary shocks in all: shocks to money demand in the U.S., Japan, and
ROECD; shocks to aggregate demand in each region; shocks to prices in each

region including OPEC prices; and shocks to portfolio preferences. We
primarily restrict our attention to stochastically independent shocks. However,
we do consider one case of negatively correlated velocity shocks.

Simulation Results

Impulse responses to 7 of the shocks (of unit size) are illustrated in

figures 1 to 7 in appendix B. The reader is referred to this appendix for
more discussion of the results. These figures contain the responses of U.S.
output, inflation, the current account, exchange rate and short interest rates
for shocks -in the case of a flexible exchange rate with no policy response.

To save space, only the results for shocks to U.S. and ROECO aggregate demand,

prices and money demand are presented. These figures illustrate the dynamics
of the model and the nature of the various shocks under the alternative regimes.

A.

Shocks Observed or Unobserved
Using the procedures outlined in Section III, we calculate the standard

deviations of a set of targets given the set of stochastic shocks under the
first six exchange regimes (the case of leaning with/against the wind is

discussed in the next section). Tables 1 to 12 contain the results for each
of the shocks where the shocks are assumed to be independent. Table 13

-24-

illustrates the results for a negatively correlated monetary shock. Within
each table are the results for the standard deviations of output, inflation,
and the current account, and the budget deficit, for both the U.S. and ROECO,

in the case of observed and unobserved shocks. In order to save space, we do
not include the results for Japan, as they are qualitatively similar to the

ROECD and U.S. results. To read these tables note that each column
corresponds to a rule being followed by the major regions and each row
corresponds to the standard errors of the target variables. Therefore -in

Table 1, with a stochastic portfolio shock (with unit variance) in a flexible
exchange rate regime with no policy reaction, the standard deviation of U.S.

output is 0.323. In the noncooperative regime the standard deviation of U.S.
output is .265 if the shock is unobserved by policymakers and .050 if the

shock is observed. Table 14 contains a calculation of welfare loss for each
region using the intertemporal utility function shown -in equation (27).

Before examining the consequences of each shock in detail, there are
several general points to note about the implications of the observability of

any shock. First, whether or not a shock is observed does not affect the
results for the flexible exchange rate regime or the fixed exchange rate
regimes since monetary policy is set to maintain the fixed exchange rate

independently of the shocks. There is no policy response under the floating
exchange rate case and so observing or not observing the shock makes no

difference. Second, observing a shock generally reduces the variances of
the targets. This is not a general proposition because for a range of welfare
functions, it is possible that when shocks are observed, policymakers could
use that information to choose a rule that raises the variance of some targets

—25—

while lowering the variance of other targets. For example, if a policymaker
cares about targets other than output or inflation, it is possible that -in

minimizing the variance of some other target, the variance of output and
inflation may increase if the shock is observed and the policymaker acts
quickly to offset the effect of the shock on his target variable.
Tables 1 and 2 contain the results for a shock that shifts the demand by
private portfolio holders for dollar assets relative to ECU- or Yen-dominated
assets, respectively. The cooperative rule dominates the other regimes -in

terms of minimizing the variance of the target variables presented. Note that
the difference between the cooperative and noncooperative rules are very

small. This is the case for each of the shocks considered below, and suggests

that the gains to coordination are small in this empirical model. In Sachs
and McKibbin (1985) we also found that policy coordination yielded rather
small gains for the industrialized countries, but that the gains to the developing
countries from coordination of the industrialized countries were potentially

quite large. We do not consider this aspect of policy coordination here.
Depending on the weight one places on the various targets, the nominal
GNP targetting performs about as well as the flexible exchange rate system if
the portfolio shocks are unobserved and better if the policymakers can observe

the shocks and act quickly to offset them. The two fixed exchange rate
regimes perform poorly for this type of shock.

The results for aggregate demand shocks in the U.S., Japan and ROECD are
presented in Tables 3 to 5.

In the case of the U.S. demand shock, cooperation

dominates for the country that does not directly experience the demand shock,

but is worse for the U.S. In the case of the ROECD and Japanese shocks,

-26-

cooperation benefits each region. This result depends on the weights each
region receives in the global planner's objective function. We assume GNP
weights in this analysis. Presumably a set of weights can be found for the
U.S. shock in which cooperation benefits each country.
Nominal GNP targeting now performs marginally better than a flexible

exchange rate in the case of unobserved demand shocks and much better.if the

shocks are observed. The McKinnon rule is again dominated by the other
regimes. The added flexibility of the global GNP targeting shows to be
beneficial. It reduces the variance of targets relative to the McKinnon rule
and reduces the variance of targets relative to the other regimes for the

ROECD. This property is the result of the weights placed on each country in
creating the average measure of world GNP. No weighting will make every
country better off relative to the cooperative regime.

Results for an OPEC oil price shock are shown in Table 6. Cooperation is
again the dominant regime. The McKinnon rule now performs well and dominates
the country-specific and global GNP targeting regimes. This occurs because
the world money supply does not accommodate the price shock and there is

little need for exchange rate adjustment between the U.S. and ROECO. Although
the results are not shown, this is not the case for Japan. This can be seen
in the summary welfare calculations in Table 14. Japan requires a
depreciation relative to the other major regions when oil prices rise (and an
appreciation when oil prices fall) and is hurt by the nonadjustment on nominal
exchange rates.

Tables 7 to 9 contain the results for uncorrelated price shocks in each

region. The small difference between cooperation and noncooperation is

—27—

again seen here. The McKinnon rule and global GNP targeting again stand out as
accentuating the variance of the targets.
To this point the fixed exchange rate regimes have performed poorly

relative to the other regimes. This is not altogether surprising because the
shocks have been from the real economy and real exchange rate adjustment is

required. In our model with sticky prices, no initial adjustment of the real
exchange rate can occur when the nominal exchange rate is also fixed.
Tables 10 to 12 illustrate the results for an uncorrelated shock to money

demand in each region. Compared to the regimes with unobserved shocks, the
McKinnon rule works well for the country in which the shock occurs because the

shock is dissipated to the rest of the world. The other countries suffer from
greater variance of targets relative to the other regimes. This is a familiar
result in which a domestic monetary shock is best handled by a fixed exchange

rate because it dissipates the shock throughout the world economy. Other
countries would prefer a flexible exchange rate to aid in insulating their own

economies against the shock. However, when compared to the case of the
observed shocks the McKinnon rule performs less well because in other regimes

the authorities can directly offset the shock in the money market. Under the
McKinnon rule the constraint on global money supplies necessitates the

transmission of the shock to other money markets. This highlights a problem
with the McKinnon rule even in the case of money demand shocks for which it
was designed. For the shock to be totally offset -it would require a rise in
the world money stock with the only change to national money stocks being in

the region where the money demand shock occurs. If the shocks are negatively
correlated across countries (i.e. money demand rises in one country while it

-28-

falls in another) then the McKinnon rule would totally offset the shocks.

There would not be any need for a change in the global money stock. This is
illustrated in Table 13 which shows the consequences of a negatively

correlated money demand shock in the U.S. and ROECD. This shock assumes that
the unit shocks to the demand for money are perfectly negatively correlated in

the two regions. The McKinnon rule performs very well compared to the other
regimes when the shocks are unobserved. The small deviations result because
the weights on each country in calculating the global money stock are not

equal, yet the shock is the same size in each country. With observed shocks
the other regimes can again completely offset the shock in the money markets
and so the McKinnon rule is marginally outperformed.

In Table 14 we apply the welfare function given in equation (27) to

calculate a summary measure of welfare loss for the U.S., ROECO and Japan under

each regime. The results conform with the discussion on individual variances
above.

In summary, the cooperative and noncooperative regimes under a floating
exchange rate perform better than any of the fixed exchange rate regimes
except in the case of an unobserved negatively correlated velocity shock.

This shows the main advantage of the McKinnon rule. In general, the global
nominal GOP targetting regime outperforms the McKinnon rule because it allows

some flexibility in adjusting the world stock of money when required. This
additional flexibility is not enough to offset a problem with the fixed

exchange rate regimes. With sticky prices, a fixed exchange rate initially
prohibits the adjustment of the real exchange rate when it is required. The
reader is referred to Roubini (1986) for a discussion of the conditions under

—29-

which a fixed exchange rate can lead to the optimal cooperative outcome in a
theoretical three country model.

The analysis so far may be unfair to the McKinnon proposal. There are
many issues which we have not addressed and circumstances which would favor a

rule such as the McKinnon proposal. We have ignored the problems with
uncertain parameter values that would hinder the implementation of any of the

"optimal" rules. One of the appealing features of the McKinnon proposal is the
ease of implementation of the rule. The other rules we investigate are very
complicated functions linking the control variables to the conditions of the
economy and would be difficult to implement.

B.

Leaning With the Wind or Leaning Against the Wind and Optimal Filtering
Many economists have advocated the use of intermediate targets and

indicators to set policy. One such application is the prescription to set

monetary policy by observing movements in the nominal exchange rate. This has
been called "leaning with the wind" -if the policy is to relax monetary policy

when the exchange rate is depreciating and "leaning against the wind" if the

policy is to relax monetary policy when the exchange rate is appreciating. In
the former policy the objective is to push the exchange rate in the direction
that it is already moving and in the latter case it is to dampen any movement.
In this section we formalize the policy using the third technique outlined in

Section III above. We assume that policymakers observe the exchange rate and
apply an optimal filtering rule to find an appropriate feedback rule linking

monetary policy to the exchange rate. To illustrate the key point of this
section we make different assumptions about the underlying nature of the shocks

—30-

and derive the best rule linking the control variables (monetary supplies) to
the observed variable (the effective nominal exchange rate).
Consider the problem faced by the U.S. when the underlying shocks are

known to be either aggregate demand or money demand shocks. Consider how the
policymakers should act if they know which of the two shocks has occurred.
In the case of a known positive aggregate demand shock, without a policy

response, the exchange rate would appreciate and output and inflation would rise

above the desired levels. The appropriate response is to contract monetary
policy to offset the demand shock. In the case of a rise in money demand, with
no policy response, there would be falling output and an appreciating exchange

rate as the result of rising interest rates. The policymaker can completely
offset the effect of the money demand shock by a money supply expansion. There
would then be no spillover effects from the money market to the rest of the

economy. Now suppose that the shocks themselves are unobserved, but that the
the exchange rate is observed to be appreciating. Given a conditional
variance—covariance matrix, the authorities apply the filtering rule to

determine the best rules to link policy to the exchange rates. As an
illustration suppose that shocks have zero covariance. Table 15 shows the
optimizing rule linking the monetary policy to the exchange rate for a range

of variances of the shocks. The calculation of expected value is based on
actual shocks of unit value.

This table illustrates the proposition that if the shock causing the
appreciation is more likely to be an increase in aggregate demand, the

policymaker should contract monetary policy. In this case a rise in aggregate
demand is accompanied by an appreciating currency. The contractionary monetary

—31—

policy will reinforce the appreciating currency and so will be a policy of
"leaning with the wind." If the shock is more likely to be a rise in the demand
for money, the policymaker should accommodate the shock by expanding monetary

policy. In this case, a rise in money demand is also accompanied by an
appreciating currency. The appropriate policy response is to "lean against the
wind" and adopt an expansionary monetary policy which will offset the

appreciating currency. The reason for the large offset coefficient when the
shock is a monetary shock comes from the property that a monetary shock can be

completely offset in the money market. The exchange rate will be independent of
the shock in this case.

The example illustrates a proposition that is central to this paper. The
appropriate policy rule depends crucially on the nature and observability of

the shocks hitting the world economy. This general principal clearly needs
further detailed investigation.

VI. Conclusion

This paper has presented techniques for examining the operating

characteristics of alternative rules for the world monetary system. We have
shown that the performance of each regime depends crucially on the nature of the
shocks impinging on the economy using a dynamic general equilibrium simulation

model of the world economy. For the country-specific shocks considered
above, the fixed exchange rate regimes perform poorly in the sense of leading

to a large variance of a set of macroeconomic target variables. When a shock
requires adjustment of the real exchange rate, a regime of fixed nominal

—32—

exchange rates in a sticky price world, leads to short term nonadjustment of
the real exchange rate which results in increased variance of target

variables. For global shocks, such as a change in OPEC prices, the fixed
exchange rate regime performs tolerably well. For other shocks, such a
negatively correlated monetary shocks, the fixed exchange rate regime proposed
by McKinnon performs quite well.

Although the results are model specific, the techniques we have developed
allow us to more fully explore the implications of any proposal for reforming
the world monetary system than is possible in simple theoretical models of

international interdependence. We are now continuing this work in a more
complete empirical model.

where the subscript i refers to country i.
The trick to solving the infinite horizon case is to assume that the problem is

really of finite-time, with a horizon 1. As is usual with dynamic programming,

we use a process of backward recursion. We first solve the maximization problem

in period T, assuming that period I is the final period. Assuming e11 = eT and
using (A2) gives the jumping variables as a function of the state, control and

exogenous variables. This can be substituted into (A3) to give targets as a
function of state, control and exogenous variables as well as the stochastic

shocks. The problem becomes:

e1 =

13iTT

+ H21E1 + I-I3TeT

These rules can be substituted into the equation for the targets given in (A3),
to find the value of the welfare function in period I as a function of the state
and exogenous variables and the shocks in period T.

WiT =

V1(X1,E1,c1)

To clarify the procedure, consider period t. The problem becomes:

where C31 is a constant depending on the path of all future exogenous
variables. We can use (Al) to solve out for X.1 and to write the problem in
terms of period t variables and constants. The problem can then be solved as we
did for period I.

e+1 =

In terms of the recursion steps we have:

+ H2t+iEt+i

+

H3t+1c

Taking expectations of both sides gives:

e+1 =

where C21 is a constant containing the accumulation of all future exogenous
variables. Substituting for e+1 from (A2) and

from (Al) gives:

next decompose A into its e-igenvalue matrix and eigenvector matrix:
AP = PA

or

A = PAP

where A is a diagonal matrix with characteristic roots along the diagonal

Note that P, A, P1 are complex matrices. Then, (All) may be rewritten as:

Several of the eigenvalues will have unit values because we do not

their rate of change. The V's corresponding to these unit roots have infinite
variances. Thus, we take the subset of V's that have finite variance in the
their rate of change. The V's corresponding to these Unit roots have infinite
variances. Thus, we take the subset of V's that have finite variance in the
next steps. Call this reduced vector y.

A and P1Z are adjusted to conform

with y.

where y signifies the complex conjugate of y. Since

Then from (A14) and assuming constant exogenous variables:

Equation (A15) implicitly defines Q which is the unconditional variance of y.

This equation is solved by an iterative procedure to find Q. The target vector

(A3).

this implies

Very importantly, all V's having unit roots have no effect on Tt. For m

unit roots, the first m columns of (MP) are zero. Thus, by eliminating
the first m columns of MP, equation (Al?) may be rewritten as:

Appendix B: Impulse Response to Shocks

To assist the reader in understanding the nature of the shocks facing
the policymakers, we present results for shocks under a floating exchange rate
regime with no policy response. Figures 1 to 7 contain the impulse responses of

us,

output,

inflation, current account, interest rate and exchange rate to

each of the shocks. The shocks examined are a 1% increase in the demand for ECU
denominated assets, a 1% increase in U.S. and ROECO aggregate demand, a 1% rise
in U.S. and ROCED prices and a 196 fall in U.S. and ROECD money demand. The

results for Japanese shocks are not shown but are similiar (apart from scaling)

to the ROECD shocks. To read the figures note that the results are presented
as: percentage deviation of output and exchange rate from base; change in inflation and interest rates from base; and deviation of the current account from
base as a percent of potential U.S. GNP.
Figures la and lb contain the results for a temporary increase in the

demand for ECU denominated assets. The shock is imposed as an exogenous risk
premium in the portfolio balance equation which is sufficient to lead to a 1.396

impact depreciation of the nominal dollar/ecu exchange rate. The depreciation
improves the U.S. current account immediately by 0.08% of U.S. GNP and leads to

a rise in output of .22%. The output stimulus is quickly crowded out by rising
interest rates and an initial inflation rise, resulting from the depreciation.
The results for exogenous shifts in aggregate demand in the U.S. is

given in figures 2a and 2b. The 1% shock in the U.S. is sufficient to raise output by 1.596 in the first period due to multiplier effects. Interest rates rise

by 1.25 percentage points in the first year. Inflation actually declines in the

—51-

first

year due to our assumption of sticky domestic prices. The exchange rate

appreciation of 2.796 leads to an initial decline 'in consumer price inflation

which quickly rebounds as excess demand pushes up the domestic price component
-in subsequent years. The current account deteriorates by 0.3796 of GNP in the

first year due the the strong domestic demand and an appreciated currency.
Figures 3a and 3b give the effects on U.S. variables of a corresponding
shock to aggregate demand in the ROECO. The foreign demand shock equal to 196 of
ROECO GNP improves the U.S. current account by .1996 of U.S. GNP. The dollar
depreciates 2.696 on impact. The U.S. is faced with rising interest rates,

strong demand and rising inflation. The major difference (apart from scale
effects) between the foreign and the U.S. demand shocks are that a deteriorating
current account and strong dollar accompanies the U.S. shock and improved
current account and depreciated dollar accompanies the ROECO shock.

The results for a U.S. price shock are given in figure 4a and 4b and
for the ROECO price shock in figure 5a and 5b. The shock is implemented by
adding an exogenous term to the Phillips curve -in each country. Note that the
shock affects prices in the second period although the presence of forward

looking asset prices causes some adjustment in the first period. U.S. output
falls by 1.396 when the U.S. price shock -is realized, and the current account

deteriorates for several years following the shock. Global inflation and higher

world interest rates follow each price shock. The nominal exchange rate
appreciates initially and depreciates over time. The jump appreciation follows
from the anticipated nature of the shock. Since nominal U.S. interest rates

exceed foreign interest rates in the first year, by the interest arbitrage

condition, the U.S. dollar must be expected to depreciate. A similar line of

—52—

reasoning applies to the jump depreciation following the ROECO price shock.
Figures Ga, 6b, 7a and 7b contain the response to an exogenous
reduction in money demand in the U.S. and ROECD respectively. For the U.S shock,
the initial excess supply of money causes a fall in nominal and real interest

rates and a rise in output. The exchange rate depreciates in the period of the
shock due to the low interest rate. The strong first period output effect feeds
into inflation in the second period. The rise in prices swings the money market
into an excess demand for real money balances in the second period by which time

the exogenous demand for money has dropped. This leads to a sharp rise in
interest rates and a fall of output. The role of sticky prices in our model is
apparent once again.

The ROECO shock is transmitted very slightly. In this

case the positive effect of strong initial ROECD demand is offset by an exchange
rate depreciation which results in very slight improvement of the U.S. current
account.
