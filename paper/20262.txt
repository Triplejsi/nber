Channeling Remittances to Education: A Field Experiment Among Migrants from El Salvador

ABSTRACT
We implement a randomized experiment offering Salvadoran migrants matching funds for educational
remittances, which are channeled directly to a beneficiary student in El Salvador chosen by the migrant.
The matches lead to increased educational expenditures, higher private school attendance, and lower
labor supply of youths in El Salvador households connected to migrant study participants. We find
substantial “crowd-in” of educational investments: for each $1 received by beneficiaries, educational
expenditures increase by $3.72. We find no shifting of expenditures away from other students, and
no effect on remittances.

Introduction
On a global scale, migrant remittances are one of the largest types of

international financial flows to developing countries, amounting in 2012 to over
US$400 billion (World Bank 2012). By contrast, developing country receipts of
official foreign development assistance in 2012 amounted to just US$126 billion
(OECD 2013). While migrant remittance flows are large in magnitude, they amount
to only a minority of the total developed-country earnings of migrant workers from
developing countries (Clemens et al. 2009, Clemens 2011, Yang 2011). The
prospect that migrants might be encouraged to send even more remittances, and
that these remittances might be better leveraged for the economic development of
migrant-origin countries, has led to substantial interest in academic and policy
circles in development policies related to migrant remittances. 1
A type of remittance-related program that has generated particular interest
is a matching program to stimulate the use of remittances for investment in migrantorigin countries. Such programs have been implemented by home country
governments, but to date have not been rigorously evaluated. For example, the
Mexican “Tres por Uno” (“Three for One”) program encourages Mexican migrants
abroad to invest in their communities of origin. Each dollar invested by migrants is
matched by $3 from the Mexican government. Migrants have contributed an
average of $15 million annually since the program began (Hazán 2012).
Additionally, there has been particular interest in enhancing the positive impacts of
remittances on education. Existing research provides evidence of positive impacts
of migration and remittances on educational outcomes in migrant-origin countries
(Cox-Edwards and Ureta 2003; Yang 2008; Theoharides 2014).
In this paper, we study a novel program that seeks to stimulate migrant

remittances.

remittances for educational purposes by providing subsidies in the form of
matching funds. The program’s target population is migrants from El Salvador and
households in the home country that are connected to these migrants. We designed
and offered migrants a new product, named “EduRemesa,” which allowed migrants
to channel funds towards the education of a student of their choice in El Salvador
for the 2012 school year. 2 EduRemesa beneficiary students in El Salvador received
an ATM card in their name, providing access to the funds, and were told that the
funds were for expenditures related to their own education.
We conducted a randomized controlled trial to measure take-up and impacts
of the EduRemesa at various levels of matching funds. We randomly assigned
migrants (recruited in metro Washington, DC) to a control group or one of a number
of treatment conditions which varied in the degree to which our research project
matched EduRemesa funds for the beneficiary student. In the “3:1 match”
treatment, each dollar contributed by the migrant was matched with $3 in project
funds. In the “1:1 match” treatment, each dollar contributed by the migrant was
matched with $1 in project funds. In a third treatment group (“no match”), migrants
were simply offered the EduRemesa product without matching funds.
Several months after the EduRemesa offers to migrants, we conducted
follow-up surveys to establish impacts of our treatments. Migrants could have sent
EduRemesas to many possible students in El Salvador, so it was important that at
baseline we elicited from migrants, in both the control and treatment groups, a
“target” student whom they would be likely to fund if offered the EduRemesa
product. Our measurement of impacts in El Salvador relies on surveys of these
target students, and of a knowledgeable adult in the student’s household.
Our first key finding is that take-up of the EduRemesa was monotonically
related to the match level. 18.5% of migrants in the 3:1 match treatment executed
2

“Remesa” is the Spanish word for “remittance.” The US dollar is the national currency of El
Salvador.

2

at least one EduRemesa transaction, compared to 6.9% in the 1:1 match group and
exactly zero in the no-match group. 15.1% and 6.0% of migrants with the 3:1 and
1:1 matches, respectively, sent an EduRemesa to their target student.
These results indicate a high elasticity of demand for channeling
remittances towards education with respect to the match rate. The finding of zero
demand for the unsubsidized (“no match”) EduRemesa contrasts with other studies
that have found that migrants seek greater control over how their remittances are
used. Our results may reveal that there is no “pure” or unsubsidized demand for
control over the use of remittances for education in this context. However, it is also
possible that take-up without the matching funds was dampened by non-trivial
transaction costs of using the EduRemesa, as well as liquidity constraints on the
part of migrants who had to pay the entire EduRemesa amount up front.
In addition, we find that the 3:1 match treatment leads to large increases in
educational expenditures on the target student. We find substantial “crowd-in” of
household educational investments in response to the matching funds. Not only are
the EduRemesa funds supplementing (rather than substituting for) existing
expenditures on education, the funds stimulate additional educational investments
on the target student. We find a “crowd-in ratio” (ratio of increased target student
educational expenditure to EduRemesa funds received) of 3.72 (each dollar of
EduRemesa funds leads to $3.72 in additional spending). In addition, the 3:1 match
leads to a higher likelihood of attending private school and to lower labor supply
on the part of target students. To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide
evidence of crowd-in of education expenditures (or any household investment) in
response to a subsidy. Crowd-in is clearly a theoretical possibility, simply
representing the case where education is a normal good while “all other goods” are
collectively inferior goods. 3
3

Crowd-in becomes more likely (and can be large in magnitude) if increasing consumption of
education requires a discrete increase in expenditure. In practice, this could be the case when a

3

Budget constraints prevented us from fielding full income, consumption and
expenditure modules in the follow-up survey, so we are unable to say definitively
where the funds for additional crowded-in educational expenditures came from.
That said, we can say that these crowded-in funds did not come from additional
remittances sent by the migrant, since we find no change in target student household
remittance receipts. We also find that increased expenditures on target students are
not funded via reductions in expenditures on other students in the household.
This paper is related to research on crowd-out of public transfers, in which
findings of incomplete crowd-out are referred to as “flypaper effects” (see Payne’s
2009 review). Several papers find no crowd-out of resources within households in
response to transfers provided to households for particular purposes, such as Jacoby
(2002), Islam and Hoddinott (2009) and Afridi (2010) in the context of child
nutrition programs. Shi (2012) documents a flypaper effect in the context of a
change in school fees in rural China. Conversely, Das et al. (2013) find crowd-out
of household educational expenditures in response to anticipated public grants to
schools. The Angrist et al. (2002) study of Colombian private school vouchers
comes closest to finding crowd-in in response to a subsidy, but that paper does not
provide a formal statistical test of the hypothesis that household educational
expenditures rose by more than the value of the subsidy. 4 In contrast to these
studies, we find evidence of crowd-in of household resources in response to a

subsidy induces a shift from public to private school, and where private schools require discretely
higher expenditures. Peltzman (1973) makes a version of the same point, showing theoretically and
empirically how subsidies for higher education in the form of state universities can lead to overall
reductions in expenditures on higher education because the subsidy is in-kind and not valid at private
institutions. Our results are consistent with this possibility, in that the match leads to large increases
in private school attendance, and that typical expenditures on private schools in El Salvador are
substantially higher than on public schooling.
4
The Angrist et al (2002) crowd-in ratio of 1.26 incorporates the opportunity cost of student labor
hours (which fell in response to the voucher). The corresponding figure in our study is therefore
5.38 (column 3, Table 6), which similarly takes into account the opportunity cost of student time.
Exclusive of the opportunity cost of student time, Angrist et al. (2002) estimate a crowd-in ratio of
0.70; in our study the corresponding figure is 3.72 (column 1, Table 6).

4

transfer that is large in magnitude and statistically significant. 5
Our work is also related to the literature on cash transfers and education. 6
While existing studies have not examined impacts on education expenditures, 7 our
results are reminiscent of certain findings in that literature. Baird et al. (2011) and
Edmonds and Schady (2012) find large effects of unconditional cash transfers on
school attendance, implying substantial elasticities of attendance with respect to
income. Angelucci et al. (2009) find that the Mexican conditional cash transfer
program increased secondary school enrollment only when eligible secondary
school students had eligible primary school students in their family network.
Transfers to households with a secondary school student appear to have crowded
in transfers from other eligible households for secondary students’ expenditures.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the context and field
experimental design. Section 3 provides an overview of the data and sample
summary statistics. Section 4 presents the empirical results, and Section 5
concludes and discusses policy implications.
2. Project Description
A. Overview of education in El Salvador
The education system in El Salvador is divided into four levels: primary
(grades 1-6), lower secondary or middle school (grades 7-9), secondary (grades 1012), and tertiary. Primary school enrollment rates are high in El Salvador, at 95%
in 2009. However, enrollment quickly falls off at the middle and secondary levels.
5

Carneiro et al. (2012) find that a public health intervention (anti-malarial spraying) crowds in
household purchases of another health good (insecticide-treated bednets) in Eritrea, but do not
estimate the change in total household health expenditures.
6
Conditional cash transfer programs now exist in a many countries, and have been shown to lead to
increased school enrollment and reduced dropout. Studies include Schultz (2004), Behrman et al
(2005), Barrera et al (2011), Baird et al (2011), and Glewwe and Kassouf (2012). Benhassine et al.
(2013) show that labeling a cash transfer as intended for education can have similar positive effects
on school participation as imposing conditionality. See Fiszbein and Schady (2009) for a review.
7
Some studies of the impacts of CCTs have gone beyond schooling measures to examine impacts
on household consumption (Hoddinott and Skoufias 2004; Angelucci and Attanasio 2009;
Angelucci and de Giorgi 2009).

5

In 2009, enrollment rates in middle and secondary school were only 56% and 32%
respectively (FUSADES 2011). Although public schools below the tertiary level
do not charge tuition or fees in El Salvador, the costs of attending secondary school
are nonetheless higher than for primary school. Older students have higher
opportunity costs, and secondary schools are often further away and require
expenditures on uniforms and school supplies. These characteristics of the El
Salvador educational system make it an appropriate setting within which to study a
project that is targeted towards secondary and tertiary students.
Most students at the primary and secondary school level in El Salvador
study in public schools. Online Appendix Table 1 shows figures from the 2010
Encuesta de Hogares de Propositos Multiples (EHPM), an annual, nationally
representative, household survey in El Salvador. 89% of primary students and 79%
of secondary students attend public schools. At the tertiary level, private institutions
are much more important, with 60% of enrolled students attending a private
institution. There are significant cost differences between attending public and
private institutions. At both the secondary and tertiary level, average annual
expenditures are roughly two-thirds higher in private than in public schools ($2214
compared to $1442 for secondary schools and $2834 compared to $1868 for tertiary
schools). 8
B. Project overview
Migrants from El Salvador were recruited to participate in this project at the
two locations of the Salvadoran consulate in the Washington, DC area. Baseline
field work ran from November 2011 to early February 2012, overlapping with the
period between the end of the 2011 school year and the start of the 2012 school
year. 9 While waiting for consular services, migrants were approached by project

staff and asked if they wished to participate in the study. Because the product being
evaluated was targeted towards students at the secondary or tertiary level, migrants
were required to have a relative in El Salvador who would be eligible for secondary
or tertiary studies in the 2012 school year. 10 Migrants who agreed to participate in
the study were administered a baseline survey.
A key objective of this research is to measure impacts on students and
households in El Salvador. Thus, a challenge that arises is determining which
students and households in El Salvador to survey, since migrants who are offered
EduRemesas could use them for students in multiple potential households. In
addition, it is important to determine the identity of surveyed students and
households in El Salvador in a consistent manner across treatment conditions, so as
to avoid the possibility that treatment status would affect which El Salvador student
and household the migrant study respondent chose to identify.
Our approach was to identify, for all migrants, the student in El Salvador
whom they would prioritize to receive additional educational financing. Our
presumption was that this student would be the one they would finance with an
EduRemesa (if offered the EduRemesa, and choosing to take up). Specifically, we
asked migrants to enter a student of their choosing in El Salvador (who would be
eligible for secondary or tertiary schooling in the coming year) into a lottery to
receive a $500 scholarship for the 2012 school year. 11 This was done at the
beginning of the baseline survey, before treatment status was revealed, and so rules
out differential selection of target students on the basis of treatment status. We refer
to this student as the “target student” and to the student’s household as the “target
household.” The rest of the baseline survey included questions about demographics,

10

Of those migrants approached, 24% participated. Of those who did not participate, 77% did not
know an eligible student, 14% refused, 7% were not from El Salvador, and 2% did not participate
for other reasons.

Target students were not required to be currently enrolled in school.

remittances, and the target student and household. Immediately following the
baseline survey, project staff implemented the randomized treatments. 12
Follow-up surveys were then conducted from July to October 2012 (the last
third of the 2012 school year), in random order. A phone survey of migrant
respondents collected information about remittances sent to the target household.
We also collected information about the target household via phone surveys,
separately interviewing the target student and a knowledgeable adult in the
household. Students provided information about their education and labor supply,
while the adults provided information related to the education of other students in
the household. We use these follow-up surveys, combined with administrative
information about the take up of the EduRemesas, to analyze treatment impacts.
C. Details of EduRemesa treatments
We partnered with the Fundación Empresarial para el Desarrollo Educativo
(FEPADE), 13 an educational NGO in El Salvador, to develop the EduRemesa.
Migrant participants were randomly assigned to be either part of a control group or
one of three treatment groups that received offers for the EduRemesa at varying
matching levels. In order to avoid spillovers between participants, a first-stage
randomization was conducted at the day-by-location level that assigned migrants
to either the control group or to a group that would receive an offer of the
EduRemesa. On each day and at each location all migrants were either in the control
group or not. One third of days were allocated to the control group and two thirds
to the EduRemesa group. This randomization was stratified by week and location.

12

Following the conclusion of the baseline interaction with the migrant, the target household in El
Salvador was administered a phone survey. These mainly serve to establish a first contact with the
El Salvador household, with the intention of reducing attrition in the later follow-up survey. Because
some time had passed between the migrant treatment in the United States and the survey in El
Salvador (the mean time between surveys was fifteen days), responses and behaviors by El Salvador
respondents could have already been influenced by the treatments, so these phone El Salvador
surveys cannot be considered baseline data.

8

In a second randomization, all migrants who had been selected to receive
an EduRemesa offer were divided into three groups: receiving no match offer, a 1:1
match offer, or a 3:1 match offer. This randomization was done at the individual
level and was stratified within sequentially-numbered groups of six surveys. All
treatment materials were contained in a sealed envelope attached to each survey
that was opened by the surveyor when the survey concluded and the treatment
began. Surveyors did not know before opening the envelope which match treatment
had been assigned. The randomization process is depicted in Online Appendix
Figure 1. The following is a description of the information provided to the different
groups. 14
Control group: Encouragement to send remittances for education
Migrants in the control group were provided with a handout that discussed
the importance of supporting education in El Salvador and suggested sending
remittances directly to students in monthly installments. Project staff reviewed the
handout with the migrant and gave it to the migrant to take home. The control group
was provided with this information to help ensure that any effects found of the
EduRemesa could be interpreted as due to the product itself, and not due to the
encouragement that it provided for directing remittances towards education or to
specific suggestions on how to send remittances for education.
Treatment group 1: EduRemesa with no match (without subsidy)
Migrants in this group were provided with the same information and
handout given to the migrants in the control group. Following that discussion,
migrants were then introduced to the EduRemesa. Migrants were given a pamphlet
that they reviewed with the surveyor that contained all relevant information and
contact information for US based project staff and FEPADE in El Salvador.
EduRemesas were available in the fixed amounts of $300 or $500 for

14

9

secondary school students and $600 or $800 for tertiary students. 15 As part of the
project, migrants were exempted from paying FEPADE’s administrative fees, and
they received a coupon with the informational pamphlet that informed them of
this. 16 Migrants who took up the EduRemesa chose the beneficiary student and
beneficiaries received an ATM card from FEPADE and one tenth of the amount
sent by the migrant would be deposited into their accounts every month during the
ten months of the school year. This money was intended to be used by the student
for expenses related to their education, but this was not enforced. The purpose of
offering the EduRemesa without any subsidy was to analyze the demand for and
impact of a product that allowed migrants to directly channel remittance funds
toward education.
Treatment group 2: EduRemesa with a 1:1 match
Migrants in this group received the same information as migrants in
treatment 1, but their coupon informed them that in addition to not having to pay
the administrative fees, they were being offered a 1:1 match on every dollar sent as
part of an EduRemesa. For example, in order to send a $300 EduRemesa, they
would have to provide only $150 and the project would provide the remaining $150.
Treatment group 3: EduRemesa with a 3:1 match
This treatment was identical to treatment 2, except that the match rate was
3:1. In order to send a $300 EduRemesa, migrants would have to pay only $75 and
the project would provide $225. A description of the amount to be sent by the
migrant for each treatment and EduRemesa amount is in Online Appendix Table 2.
15

The choice of these fixed amounts was motivated by the amounts offered in the existing
scholarship program run by FEPADE. FEPADE designs their scholarships with specific costs in
mind and lacks the administrative capacity to implement a larger number of choices. Additionally,
it was thought that these discrete options provided a simpler choice for the migrant participants.
Ultimately, these concerns outweighed the analytical benefits of allowing migrants free choice for
the amount of the EduRemesa.
16
FEPADE typically charges administrative fees of 15% of the total amount for their scholarship
programs. All migrants, even those in the no match group, were exempted from this administrative
fee (the fees were paid with project funds).

10

In all three treatment groups, the interaction ended by asking the migrants
whether or not they were at all interested in the EduRemesa and whether they would
like to receive a follow up call from the project. Migrants who indicated that they
were interested in sending an EduRemesa filled out a short application indicating
the identity of the student beneficiary and were contacted by phone several days
later to further discuss their interest and answer any questions. Project staff
continued to follow up with all participants until they indicated that they were no
longer interested. Migrants also had contact information for staff in the United
States and FEPADE in El Salvador.
Migrants who decided to take up the EduRemesa did so by sending the
desired amount directly to FEPADE through a money transfer company,
Viamericas Corporation, our other collaborating organization. Once FEPADE had
received the funds, they contacted the beneficiary student to request a copy of the
student’s identification card needed to issue their ATM card. Once received, the
student went to FEPADE’s offices in San Salvador or a regional office in San
Miguel to complete the paperwork. Students and their guardians were reimbursed
for travel expenses. Students were required to sign a letter acknowledging the
amount of their EduRemesa and the rules. The rules required that the students turn
in proof of enrollment, that students must attend school, comply with academic
requirements, and inform FEPADE if they stopped attending school. 17
3. Sample, balance tests, and attrition
Study participants are migrants from El Salvador recruited in the
Washington, DC area, and the target students identified by the migrants. Although
migrants could send EduRemesas to any student they wished, all impacts will be
measured on the sample of target students in both the control and treatment groups.

17

We also implemented a treatment to test the impact of offering a monitoring mechanism to
migrants by giving some migrants the ability to receive a report of student grades after each grading
period. This treatment and analysis of its impacts are described in Online Appendix C.

11

Our “full” sample consists of 991 migrants interviewed at baseline. Of these, 728
target households (the “El Salvador follow-up” sample) completed the El Salvador
follow-up survey (73% completion). Because the main outcomes of interest are
collected in the El Salvador follow-up survey, this will be our main sample of
interest. We also examine some impacts using the sample of 735 migrants who
completed the migrant follow-up survey (the “migrant follow-up sample,” 74%
completion). 18
Amounts for educational expenditures and remittances are derived through
a series of questions and imputed (in a few cases) when missing to allow for a
consistent sample. Target student education expenditures are reported by the target
student. When the target student’s report is missing, the adult’s report is used, and
in the few cases where both are missing the expenditures are imputed. For the total
expenditures category, 4.0% of observations include an adult report for at least one
of the categories and 0.8% include an imputed value for at least one of the
categories. Remittance amounts are reported by migrants, and imputed when
missing. 19.6% of observations for overall total remittances are imputed. The
substance of the results does not change when dropping imputed observations.
Further information about the variable construction for all variables and imputation
procedures can be found in Online Appendix B.
Online Appendix Table 3A provides baseline summary statistics for the El
Salvador follow-up sample. The migrants are 50% female, 37 years old on average,
and have been in the United States for an average of 11 years. Average annual
remittances to the target household are $2,684, suggesting that even though an
existing remittance relationship was not a requirement, most migrants in our sample

18

All regression results in the paper are similar when performed in a sample that was restricted to
those migrant-student pairs where both follow-ups were complete, although precision suffers due to
the reduced sample size.

12

do remit to the target households. 19 The target students are 53% female and 18.5
years old on average. They are related to the migrant in a diverse set of ways: 26%
are the migrant’s child, 25% the migrant’s sibling, 33% the migrant’s niece or
nephew, and 10% are the migrant’s cousin. 92% of target students are in school at
baseline. Online Appendix Tables 3B and 3C provide summary statistics for the
full sample and the migrant follow-up sample respectively. No meaningful
differences are apparent across the three samples at baseline. Additionally, because
migrant participants were recruited at the Salvadoran consulate, a relevant concern
is whether or not they are similar to the greater population of Salvadoran migrants.
In Online Appendix Table 4 we compare the migrants in our sample to Salvadoranborn, non-US citizens living in the Washington, DC metro area in the 2008-2010
American Community Survey (ACS) three year sample. Across a limited number
of basic characteristics the migrants in our sample are comparable to the migrants
in the ACS, with the exception that the migrants in our sample have been in the
United States for slightly less time on average (11.19 years compared to 12.93
years).
Because this is a randomized experiment, it is important to confirm that the
randomization was successful in creating balanced treatment groups. Table 1
examines balance across the treatment groups in the El Salvador follow-up sample
using the variables reported in Online Appendix Table 3. Online Appendix Tables
5A and 5B examine balance in the full and migrant follow-up samples. The first
four columns report the mean of each variable in the control group and each
treatment group. The tables also report the p-values on the F-tests for equality of
those means. The samples are well-balanced at baseline. The number of p-values
below 0.10 or 0.05 is small and not different from what would be expected given
sampling variation.
19

At baseline, 86% of migrants report sending nonzero remittances to the target household during
the past year.

13

Given the attrition from the full sample to the follow-up samples it is also
important to test whether this attrition is related to treatment. Online Appendix
Table 6 presents regression estimates of whether survey completion varies in each
of the three treatment groups compared to the control group. The table also reports
the p-values from tests of the equality of survey completion between the different
treatment groups. The dependent variables are completion of the El Salvador
follow-up, the migrant follow-up, and both surveys in columns 1, 2, and 3
respectively. The results show that attrition is not related to treatment status.
4. Empirical results
A. Estimation
Random treatment assignment allows us to estimate the causal impact of the
different EduRemesa treatments on a variety of outcomes. The main results in this

B. Take-up

14

The first step in our analysis is to examine the take up of the EduRemesa
and how that take up differs by treatment. All take-up related variables come from
the EduRemesa administrative data, provided by both Viamericas and FEPADE.
Panel 1 of Table 2 describes the basic characteristics of the EduRemesas sent. 52
EduRemesas were sent by 41 migrants. 85% of migrants who sent an EduRemesa
(35 out of 41) sent one to the target student they named at baseline. 67% of
EduRemesa recipients were target students (35 out of 52) and most EduRemesas
sent to non-target students were from migrants who sent more than one EduRemesa.
40 EduRemesas were sent in the 3:1 match group and 12 were sent in the 1:1 match
group. No migrants in the no match treatment group chose to send an EduRemesa.
Panel 2 of Table 2 displays average characteristics of EduRemesas,
conditional on the migrant sending at least one EduRemesa. Migrants supported 1.2
students on average in the 1:1 match group and 1.3 students in the 3:1 match group.
In the 1:1 and 3:1 groups respectively migrants sent (inclusive of the match) an
average of $690 and $719 in total, $540 and $465 of which went to target student
beneficiaries. Online Appendix Table 7 shows the number of EduRemesas sent by
amount of the EduRemesa. Migrants take advantage of the match offer by usually
choosing to send the larger available amount. 28 of the 34 EduRemesas sent for
secondary schooling were for $500, and 13 of the 18 sent for tertiary schooling
were for $800.
Table 3 estimates the impact of the treatments on take-up using equation
(1). The results shown in Table 3 are obtained using the El Salvador follow-up
sample and the results of the same analyses in the full and migrant follow-up
samples are shown in Online Appendix Tables 8A and 8B. Take-up in both the
control group and the no match group is zero. Both the 3:1 and 1:1 match
treatments encourage take-up relative to the no-match treatment group and the
control group, but the 3:1 match is much more effective. Column 1 examines
whether a particular migrant sent any EduRemesa, and column 2 the total number

15

of EduRemesas sent. Migrants in the 3:1 match group were 18.5 percentage points
more likely to send an EduRemesa at all and those in the 1:1 match group were 6.9
percentage points more likely. The 3:1 group sent 0.25 EduRemesas on average
and the 1:1 group sent 0.08. Migrant contributions to EduRemesas average $23
and $35 in the 1:1 and 3:1 match groups respectively (column 3). This resulted in
an average of $50 in total EduRemesa funds (migrant contribution plus matching
funds) sent from the 1:1 group and $140 sent from the 3:1 group (column 4).
Columns 5, 6, and 7 examine EduRemesas sent to target students. The 1:1
match increased the likelihood that an EduRemesa was sent to the target student by
6.0 percentage points; the same figure for the 3:1 match was 15.1 percentage points
(column 5). Migrants contributed $18 and $22 in the 1:1 and 3:1 match groups
(column 6), for average receipts by target students of $37 and $86 (column 7).
The take-up results indicate zero demand for the EduRemesa without
subsidy via matching funds. The unsubsidized EduRemesa could have been
attractive to migrants if they had stronger preferences for educational expenditures
than their family members. The existing evidence is mixed on whether migrants
desire control over how remittances are used. Ashraf et al. (forthcoming) find that
migrants demand control over savings in the home country, but Torero and Viceisza
(2013) do not find the same for control over grocery spending (both these studies
were also conducted among migrants from El Salvador in the DC metro area). De
Arcangelis et al. (2014) find, in an artefactual field experiment in Italy, that Filipino
migrants share more resources with family members in the home country when they
can label them as intended for education (a “soft” commitment), but offering a
“hard” commitment (channeling funds directly to schools) on top of the labeling
leads to a much smaller additional increase in remittances.
Zero take-up of the EduRemesa without the matching funds suggests that,
in this context, migrants do not seek greater control over remittance uses, at least
when it comes to education. However, other aspects of the specific mechanism

16

offered may have contributed to zero take-up. In particular, the fact that migrants
had to furnish the entire amount of the EduRemesa up front was probably
detrimental to take-up (given this is a relatively low-income and likely liquidityconstrained population). It is also possible that migrants did not believe that the
product would provide the level of control they desired, since funds were not
actually channeled directly to schools or educational expenditures. Other
transaction costs such as the need to collect documentation and the opportunity cost
of the time spent traveling to the disbursement site may also have impeded take-up.
Despite zero take-up in the no match group, take-up increases
monotonically with the match level and suggests a high elasticity of demand for the
EduRemesa with respect to the match rate. This finding is consistent with Duflo et
al. (2006), who found very low take-up of a savings program (Individual
Retirement Accounts, or IRAs) without a match and participation that increased in
the match level when a match was offered. 20
We interpret this result to indicate that the “demand for commitment,” in
this context, is elastic with respect to subsidies. Our results are consistent with
migrants having a demand for channeling remittances to education, but having no
demand for the unsubsidized EduRemesa because of transaction costs or liquidity
constraints, or because they perceive that the degree of commitment provided by
the EduRemesa is limited. The matching funds overcome these costs, leading to
positive take-up that monotonically increases in the match rate. 21
C. Impact on educational expenditures
We now turn to the principal question of the paper: how did the EduRemesa

20
It contrasts however, with work on charitable donations that finds that take-up does not increase
with the match rate (Karlan and List, 2007).
21
Another possibility, of course, is that migrants have no demand for commitment, are simply
“gaming” the offer to obtain the matching funds, and do not intend to use the funds for education.
As it turns out, this appears not to be the case: in Section 4.D below, we show that the EduRemesa
treatment does lead to increases in educational expenditures.

17

affect the education spending of recipients? Although the EduRemesa was
specifically marketed and designed as a tool to provide education funds directly to
students, because money is fungible it is not obvious that EduRemesa funds would
result in an increase in education expenditures. Follow-up data collected from the
target students and adults in their households allow us to answer this question.
Table 4 reports impacts on target student education expenditures. Column
1 examines total annualized expenditures on the target student’s education and
columns 2 through 9 examine expenditures by category. The main result is that the
target students in the 3:1 match group spend an average of $301 more on
educational expenses, an increase of 22% over the control group. As expected given
lower take-up, there is a smaller increase in the 1:1 match group, but it is not
statistically significant. The overall increase in the 3:1 match group is driven by
large increases in tuition ($106), transportation ($77), and food ($143). The only
statistically significant increase in the 1:1 match group is for tuition ($83). Despite
zero take-up in the no match group, tuition expenditures increase by $67, but this
does not translate to an increase in overall education expenditures. 22
In order to fully understand how the EduRemesa is affecting resources
allocated towards education it is instructive to examine total household education
expenditures. If household expenditures go up by less than target student
expenditures, then the increases documented in Table 4 may be due to shifting of
resources away from other students towards the target student. We perform this
analysis by summing the reports of expenditures on the target student with the
reports of expenditures for others aged 22 or under in the household. 23 The results
22

These results are shown graphically in Online Appendix Figure 2, which plots the cumulative
distribution of total expenditures for the control group and the three treatment groups. The
distribution of the 3:1 match group is clearly shifted to the right compared to the control group, the
no match group, and the 1:1 match group.
23
The expenditures on these other students were reported by the adult interviewed in the target
household and imputed when missing to maintain a consistent sample. 4.5% of observations in the
total expenditures category include an imputed value for at least one of the categories. Further

18

are presented in Table 5. The set-up of the table is parallel to Table 4, but all the
outcomes are for household-level expenditures.
The results mirror those for target student education expenditures.
Expenditures increase overall and this increase is driven by increases in tuition,
transportation, and food. However, the estimates on total household expenditures
are less precise and not all the impacts are statistically significant. Despite this, the
coefficients are similar in magnitude to the coefficients for target student
expenditure alone. This indicates that the increases in target student expenditures
are not accompanied by reductions in expenditures for other students.
Table 4 shows that the 3:1 match treatment increases total target student
education expenditures by $301, which should be compared to average target
student EduRemesa funds received of $85 (Table 3, column 7). It appears that
education spending increases by the total amount of the EduRemesa, and,
additionally that the EduRemesa may actually encourage further investment in
education by the target household. In other words, receipt of the EduRemesa may
actually be “crowding in” educational expenditure.
To examine this explicitly, column 1 of Table 6 reports the results of an
instrumental variables regression estimating the impact of each dollar of
EduRemesa funds on target student educational expenditures. Because the large
increases in educational expenditures occur just in the 3:1 match group, we utilize
only the control group and the 3:1 match group in this analysis. We instrument for
total target student receipt of EduRemesa funds with the 3:1 match group treatment
indicator and estimate the model by two stage least squares. As in equation (1), the
instrumental variables regressions include stratification cell fixed effects and
standard errors are clustered at the day-location level. The first stage coefficient is
85.34 and the F-statistic is 28.17, indicating that the instrument is strong according
details are described in Online Appendix B and all results are robust to the exclusion of imputed
values.

19

to the Stock and Yogo (2005) thresholds.
The estimated coefficient reveals the impact of each dollar of EduRemesa
funds on target student educational expenditures. It can be interpreted as a test of
crowd-out vs. crowd-in: a coefficient statistically significantly smaller than 1 would
reveal crowd-out, while a coefficient statistically significantly larger than 1 would
indicate crowd-in. The coefficient is 3.72, indicating that each dollar of EduRemesa
funds leads to an increase of $3.72 in target student education expenditures. This
estimate is statistically significantly different from unity at the 10% level. Because
this coefficient exceeds 1, we refer to it coefficients as a “crowd-in ratio.” 24
One caveat to the results that we present here is that all of the school
expenditure data is self-reported, leaving open concerns about experimenter
demand effects (reporting bias that is differential by treatment group). Target
students receiving the EduRemesa knew that they were receiving a transfer that was
meant to be used for education and may have overstated their educational
expenditures as a result. Unfortunately, it was infeasible for us to collect
administrative data on expenditures from the wide variety of public and private
schools attended by the students and the diverse categories in which expenditures
were made. Therefore, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that reporting
bias contributes to our large estimated effect sizes.
We can point to some evidence that reporting bias is not likely to be the
only or the principal driver of our results. First, the increases in expenditures are
concentrated in tuition, transport, and food. If target students were inflating their
expenditures, it is not clear why they would limit themselves to those three
categories, instead of increasing all their reports, or concentrating on categories

24
It should be noted that this crowd-in ratio is estimated using the limited number of discrete
amounts offered by the EduRemesa product. One limitation of our design is that we cannot
extrapolate what this crowd-in ratio may have been outside of the amounts that we offer as part of
this experiment. Larger EduRemesas for example may actually decrease crowd-in as more
expenditures are covered by the EduRemesa itself.

20

more directly linked to education such as books. Additionally, though the
EduRemesa was linked to the target student, it is possible that if reporting bias was
severe, it would spill over into reports of expenditures on other children. We find
no evidence of this, as the impacts on household expenditures (Table 5) are similar
to those on target student expenditures (Table 4). However, despite these
arguments, absent administrative data we cannot be definitive about the exact
magnitude of the impact on expenditures. 25
D. Impact on other target student outcomes
Given the finding of crowd-in it is interesting to examine other elements of
the target students’ behavior that may be consistent with these increases in
expenditure. For example, changes in school enrollment decisions could necessitate
large increases in spending that are not fully covered by the EduRemesa. In Table
7, we turn to the impacts on school enrollment and type of school. Column 1
examines whether or not the target student is in school at follow-up and columns 2
through 4 whether the target student is in any private school, parochial school, or
non-parochial private school (the latter two are subcategories of private schools).
The treatments do not have statistically significant effects on school
enrollment. There is, however, a large impact on the probability that the target
student is attending private school. Target students in the 3:1 match group are 11
percentage points more likely to be in private school. This is a large increase
relative to the control group private school attendance rate of 27%. These increases
in private school attendance concord with the increases in expenditure on tuition
and other expenditures discussed above. However, given that private school

25

Another possible interpretation of our expenditure results is that EduRemesa treatment acted to
make EduRemesa recipients simply more aware of education related costs and the differences
between treatment and control are due to improved reporting by the recipient target students. This
explanation would require that target students in the control group are systematically and
significantly under-reporting (and not over-reporting) expenditures. While we cannot be sure that
this is not happening, we see no compelling reason why under-reporting would be the norm.

21

attendance also increases in the no match group by a similar amount, it is not clear
how large a part the private school effect plays in increasing expenditures.
The concerns related to reporting bias discussed for the expenditure results
are also relevant for attendance in private school, particularly given the large size
of the effect relative to the control group. In this case we have access to some
limited administrative data to verify our survey reports. As a condition of receiving
the EduRemesa, all recipients were required to provide FEPADE with proof of
enrollment in school before transfers could begin, and FEPADE recorded whether
this school was public or private. In the sample of target students in the El Salvador
follow-up sample who received an EduRemesa the data indicates that 53% and 50%
of target students are enrolled in private school, reported in the survey data and the
FEPADE data respectively. 26 These reports are very close, and where they do not
agree, the disagreement goes in both directions. It is not only that students who are
actually in public school report that they are enrolled in private school. Although
this is only a small amount of administrative data and its analysis is not probative,
it does not suggest a large amount of reporting bias.
We also examine the impact of the treatments on target students’ labor
supply. Because the EduRemesa had no effect on overall enrollment, it is not
expected that student labor supply would be lower because of decreased drop out,
but the receipt of the EduRemesa funds may have reduced the need of the students
to work. Increased attendance at private schools may have also required target
students to dedicate more time to their studies, reducing their ability to work.
However, it is also possible that target students would have had to increase their
labor supply, given the large crowd-in of expenditures. We examine the impacts of
the match treatments on both the extensive margin (whether a student worked) and

26

This is in contrast to a 27% private school enrollment rate in the control group. Of course, we do
not know the counterfactual enrollment rate for those in the control group who would have received
an EduRemesa had they been offered it.

22

the intensive margin (hours worked per week) in Table 8. We focus here on
columns 1 and 2 which examine all work, but also present results for paid and
unpaid work separately (columns 3 through 6).
Both the 3:1 and the 1:1 matches had a significant effect on target student
labor supply. Students in the 3:1 match group are 14 percentage points less likely
to work and work an average of 4.4 fewer hours per week than students in the
control group. Students in the 1:1 match group are 7.5 percentage points less likely
to work and work 3.2 fewer hours per week. These are large effects: a 64%
reduction in the 3:1 match group compared to the control group. This is evidence
of effects on both the extensive and intensive margins. Students in the 3:1 and 1:1
match groups are much less likely to work at all, but they are also less likely to
work long hours. 27
These large reductions in labor supply for target students can be thought of
as representing another way in which target students are “spending” their
EduRemesa funds, further strengthening the evidence that the EduRemesa leads to
crowd-in of resources. To examine this, in column 2 of Table 6 we estimate the
impact of total EduRemesa funds received by the target student on the wages earned
by the target student, where the EduRemesa funds are instrumented by the 3:1
match group treatment indicator. Because wages are not reported in our survey, we
perform an approximation by multiplying the gender- and age-specific mean hourly
wage reported in the nationally-representative 2010 Encuesta de Hogares de
Propositos Multiples by the number of annual paid hours worked by the target
student. This approximation suggests that for every dollar received, target students
reduce their earnings by $1.66.

27

Online Appendix Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of hours worked by treatment. The
distributions of both the 3:1 and 1:1 match groups are shifted to the right compared to those of the
no match and control groups. The intensive margin is evidenced by the longer tails of the no
match and control group distributions

23

Finally, we can examine the household’s contribution to the target student’s
educational expenditures, net of the target student’s earnings. This is shown in
column 3 of Table 6 where the dependent variable is total target student education
expenditures minus target student estimated earnings. Using the same
instrumentation strategy with the addition of the foregone earnings, we find a large
crowd-in ratio 5.38. Because of the crude manner in which wages were estimated,
strong conclusions should not be drawn from the exact magnitudes of these
estimates. We view the results as giving a rough sense of how the estimated crowdin ratio would change when considering the reduction in target student earnings as
an additional resource contribution to the target student’s education.
E. Impact on remittances
Having examined how the EduRemesa treatments directly impacted
outcomes related to education, it is instructive to consider impacts on remittances
sent by the migrant. These remittances were reported by the migrant in the migrant
follow-up survey. The survey questions used to calculate total remittances
explicitly instructed migrants not to include any funds that were remitted as part of
an EduRemesa. Therefore, we analyze the impact of the EduRemesa treatments on
all remittances sent by the migrant, except for the funds sent as an EduRemesa.
This analysis is presented in Table 9. The dependent variable of interest is
the remittances sent by the migrant between January 1, 2012 and the follow-up
survey date to the target household (column 1), to other households in El Salvador
(column 2), and to all households (column 3). 28 Because of several outliers in the
remittance data, we also show results that trim the top one percent of values
(columns 4-6) and results that utilize the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of

28

Because the information was reported by the migrant during the migrant follow-up survey, the
analysis sample differs slightly from most other analyses in this paper, which are on the El
Salvador follow-up survey sample.

24

the remittance variable (columns 7-9). 29,30
There is no consistent evidence in Table 9 that the 3:1 match treatment (the
treatment with the highest take-up) results in changes in remittances either to the
target household or overall. The estimated coefficients are negative, but not
statistically significant. An oddity is that in columns 1-3 there appear to be negative
effects of the 1:1 and no match treatments. However, these effects are not robust to
trimming or to the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation.
The imprecision of the estimated treatment effects on remittances makes it
difficult to make strong conclusions. The results in Table 9 are suggestive that total
remittances are relatively inelastic with respect to the kind of subsidies we offered
in this intervention. Because the dependent variables in Table 9 exclude funds sent
via the EduRemesa, negative point estimates on the treatment indicators are
consistent with migrants maintaining a relatively constant total resource flow
(remittances plus EduRemesa funds) to El Salvador. Indeed, the negative point
estimate on the 3:1 match treatment in Table 9, column 1 (-167.9) is roughly similar
in magnitude to the positive point estimate on the 3:1 match treatment in Table 3,
column 7 (85.5), which is consistent with migrants reducing remittances to the
target household by roughly the match-inclusive EduRemesa amount.
Overall, it appears that the 3:1 match treatment leaves total remittances
relatively constant, reduces target student labor supply, and does not reduce
educational expenditures on other (non-target) students in the household. Funds for
observed increases in educational expenditures on target students must therefore be
coming from other sources, such as non-education household consumption or
savings.

29
The inverse hyperbolic sine transformation is log(yi+(yi2+1)1/2). It can be interpreted in the same
way as a logarithmic dependent variable, but does not suffer the same problem of being undefined
at zero (Burbidge et al. 1988).
30
All results in previous tables relating to education expenditures (Tables 4 and 5) are robust to
trimming of the top 1% and the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation.

25

F. Discussion, additional analyses, and longer term impacts
Given the long literature exploring differences in education outcomes by
gender in developing countries, we examine whether or not the EduRemesa
treatments differentially affected male and female students. This analysis is
presented in Table 10, where we examine treatment impacts on key outcomes for
female target students in Panel 1 and male target students in Panel 2. 31 The results
show that female target students in the 3:1 match group are more likely than male
target students to receive an EduRemesa (18% compared to 11%) and this translates
into larger impacts across most outcome categories for female students. The
exception are the labor market outcomes, where the impacts are similar, but this
may be due to higher rates of male students working overall. The stronger impacts
for female target students are interesting particularly in light of the fact that while
a majority of target students are female, they are not overwhelmingly so; 43% of
migrants choose male target students.
We provide some discussion and other analyses of our results in Online
Appendix C. We discuss how we rule out marketing effects as the main driver of
our results, and also discuss the relative magnitude of the impacts of the 3:1 and the
1:1 matches. We additionally provide analyses showing that an additional treatment
that varied whether migrants received official grade reports for the EduRemesa
beneficiaries had no statistically identifiable impacts. 32
In Online Appendix D we present the results of a second follow-up survey
conducted roughly one year after the first intended to study the longer-term impacts

31

Online Appendix Tables 9 and 10 show attrition and baseline balance by gender. There is no
consistent pattern of differential attrition or baseline imbalance when separating the sample by
gender. One exception is that there is lower migrant follow-up survey completion for the 1:1 match
treatment in the subsample with male target students. Additionally, there is imbalance between
treatment groups for male target students in baseline school enrollment.
32
In the same sample, using an artefactual field experiment, Ambler (2014) finds that remittance
recipients do not alter spending decisions in response to being monitored by the migrant. This
suggests that, in this context, recipients are not responsive to migrant monitoring.

26

of the EduRemesa program. Due to high attrition (46% completion), we do not
discuss these results in the main text of the paper. Many of the results follow the
same basic patterns, with the exception of the labor supply results which are no
longer present. However, due to the high attrition, small sample sizes do not allow
us to draw definitive conclusions.
5. Conclusions and policy implications
These results can help guide policies aimed at increasing the development
impact of remittances. They indicate that programs subsidizing education in
developing countries can extend the resources available to them via contributions
from two additional sources: 1) international migrants, who respond positively to
matching grant programs for home-country education, and 2) beneficiary
households themselves, who respond to subsidies by contributing additional
resources. Our estimates indicate that each $1 of donor funds provided for
secondary or tertiary education can generate additional contributions amounting to
$0.33 from migrants and $3.62 from beneficiary households themselves. 33
Our finding of zero take up in the no-match treatment may also reveal that
migrants have no or limited unsubsidized demand for control over remittance
recipient expenditures on education. Alternatively, transaction costs in this context
may exceed migrant willingness to pay for the services, suggesting that policy
makers should seek to reduce the administrative burden of such programs.
Beyond the use of matching funds and the payment mechanism, an
additional characteristic of the EduRemesa intervention that differentiates it from
other programs is the fact that the beneficiaries are chosen by the migrants. Given
the magnitude of the effects of the program, it seems that the migrants were
successful in selecting students likely to use the subsidy to make large investments

33

These figures are implied by the crowd-in ratio of 3.72 (column 1, Table 6): of the increase in
expenditures of $3.72, target student households fund $2.72, while the EduRemesa funds $1 (of
which $0.75 is donor-funded and $0.25 is migrant-funded).

27

in their education. In other words, although take-up was low, utilizing migrants to
screen recipients was effective in directing the program towards students who
would benefit. This result suggests that requiring contributions from family
members can do more than simply alleviate the financial burden of such educational
transfer programs, but can also serve to target those transfer programs towards
students who will benefit even with only minimal oversight.
Our results are, of course, limited to the context that we study, and so it is
not known whether self-screening by program participants would be as effective in
other situations, for example if the product was offered to a general household
population in a developing country without international migrant members.
Relatedly, transnational households may respond differently to the offer of an
EduRemesa-like product, because they self-selected into migration and may have
characteristics also associated with higher demand for long-term household
investments (such as education). Therefore, it is important to replicate this study in
other populations and contexts to gauge the generalizability of these results.

Promoviendo la Educación en El Salvador
Estudio de los Hermanos Lejanos para el Desarrollo de El Salvador
(EHLD Salvador)

LA SITUACION
El Salvador está enfrentando un desafío en los niveles educativos superiores. A pesar de que 9 de cada 10 niños en
edad escolar están matriculados en el nivel básico, solamente 3 de cada 10 jóvenes llegan a matricularse en
bachillerato. Los jóvenes Salvadoreños necesitan apoyo para continuar sus estudios en estos niveles educativos superiores y poder desarrollar las habilidades y obtener los conocimientos que necesitan para salir
adelante.

COMO LAS REMESAS PUEDEN AYUDAR
Sus remesas pueden hacer mucho para mejorar esta situación. Una manera efectiva de apoyar a un estudiante es la siguiente:
Cada año, destine una suma de dinero cuyo propósito es apoyar con la educación de un estudiante especifico en El Salvador. De esta manera usted puede estar seguro que el estudiante tendrá soporte económico
para todo el año escolar. Los montos de dinero típicamente destinados están entre $300-$500 anuales para
estudiantes en el nivel bachillerato, y $600-$800 anuales para estudiantes en el nivel técnico superior.
En lugar de enviar el dinero al padre o tutor del estudiante, puede ser más eficaz permitirles a los estudiantes recibir y gastar el dinero que va destinado para su educación. De esta manera, puede estar seguro de
que el dinero será utilizado para apoyar su educación y no en otros gastos del hogar. ¡Esto también enseña
al estudiante a ser responsable y puede ser fuente de motivación para que les vaya mejor en la escuela! Para mandar el dinero directamente al estudiante, una cuenta bancaria puede ser abierta a nombre del estudiante.
Usted puede enviar el dinero en 10 cantidades iguales durante
el transcurso del año escolar con el fin de que el estudiante utilice el dinero responsablemente y no envié todo el dinero a la vez.
Otra manera importante como usted puede ayudar a su familiar
a que tenga éxito es pedirle que le envíe sus calificaciones al final de cada ciclo académico. ¡Su supervisión también puede servir como motivación para que el estudiante se esfuerce más y le
vaya mejor en sus estudios!

Detalles y Preguntas Frecuentes

¿ Qué es EduRemesas?
EduRemesas es un servicio de FEPADE que les permite a
los migrantes salvadoreños patrocinar a un estudiante
en El Salvador.

¿Cómo funciona?
1.

¿A quién puedo patrocinar?
El alumno puede ser cualquier persona que usted conozca, siempre y cuando el estudiante se encuentre en el
nivel de bachillerato o técnico superior durante del año
escolar 2012.

 Su EHLD ID único

2.

¿Cuáles son las ventajas de EduRemesas?



¡Usted puede dirigir su dinero directamente a un
estudiante en vez de mandarlo a otras personas, como su tutor u otro adulto!



¡El estudiante tendrá dinero para pagar sus gastos
educativos a la vez que aprenderá a manejar sus fondos educativos y a ser responsable!



¡Usted hace un solo envío de dinero al inicio del año
escolar y el estudiante recibirá una cuota cada meses,
durante de los 10 meses que dura el año escolar !

¿De cuánto es EduRemesas?
Normalmente, el 15% de cada EduRemesa sería utilizado
para cubrir los costos administrativos de FEPADE. Sin
embargo, por un tiempo limitado y únicamente para participantes del EHLD Salvador, EHLD Salvador subsidiará
todos los costos de las EduRemesas. !Esto significa que
Usted sólo necesita pagar la tarifa del envío de la remesa
a FEPADE!
El monto que usted puede enviar para apoyar al estudiante dependerá del nivel de estudio del estudiante. Hay dos
montos para cada nivel de estudio y usted puede elegir
enviar uno de los dos:
 Bachillerato
USD 300 anual ($30 cada mes por 10 meses)
USD 500 anual ($50 cada mes por 10 meses)

Usted envía a FEPADE una remesa a través de cualquier agente de Viamericas antes del inicio del año
escolar 2012. Usted incluirá con esta remesa:

a FEPADE copias de sus documentos de identificación (DUI y NIT si tiene 18 años o más, o carnet de
minoridad si es menor de 18).

Llenar la Aplicación Inicial ahora, inclusive si es
que no está seguro de que quiere participar. FEPADE necesitará la información para procesar su aplicación, pero no se le obligará a participar!
Si usted no terminó la aplicación durante de su entrevista inicial, llame a IPA parar poder terminarla.
¡También, llame a IPA con cualquier pregunta que
tenga!

FEPADE encargará de abrir una cuenta bancaria al
nombre del estudiante para que puede acceder al
dinero que usted le manda y reunirá con el estudiante para entregarle su tarjeta de debito. FEPADE no
puede abrir esta cuenta si no tiene copias de sus
documentos de identidad.

Hablar con el estudiante y su familia en El Salvador para contarles de esta oportunidad.

FEPADE depositará el dinero enviado por usted
mensualmente en la cuenta bancaria del estudiante
en cantidades iguales durante cada uno de los 10
meses del año escolar 2012.

Mandar una remesa a FEPADE a través de Viamericas con el monto que usted ha elegido.
*Llame 1-800-401-7626 para encontrar un Viamericas cerca a usted.

¡Cada mes el estudiante retirará el dinero depositado
por FEPADE con su tarjeta de débito y con ella pagará los costos relacionados a su educación!

Online Appendix B: Variable definitions
Data used in this paper came from three surveys. Baseline surveys were conducted with migrants
between early November 2011 and early February 2012. Follow-up surveys were conducted by
phone with migrants and the target household in El Salvador (both the target student and a
responsible adult) from mid July 2012 to late October 2012. A second follow-up was conducted
approximately one year after the first in October and November 2013. We also use
administrative data from the EduRemesa project. Because El Salvador uses the US dollar as its
official currency, all monetary figures are in US dollars. Following are descriptions of all
variables used for baseline summary statistics and dependent variables in regressions.
Variables from baseline survey
Migrant is female is equal to one if migrant is female and zero if migrant is male.
Migrant age is migrant’s age in years, calculated from reported date of birth.
Migrant is married is equal to one if migrant reports being married or cohabiting and zero
otherwise. It is derived from asking for the migrant’s civil status.
Migrant household size in the US is the total number of persons (including the migrant) living in
the migrant’s home in the United States.
Migrant annual remittances to target household is the total amount sent by the migrant to the
target household in the 12 months preceding the survey. This equals the frequency of regular
remittance transactions over the past 12 months multiplied by the average amount per regular
remittance transaction, plus the total amounts reported to have been sent for special occasions in
various categories.
Migrant annual remittances to other households is the total amount sent by the migrant to
households that are not the target household in the 12 months preceding the survey. This equals
the frequency of regular remittance transactions over the past 12 months multiplied by the
average amount per regular remittance transaction for each household, plus the total amounts
reported to have been sent for special occasions in various categories.
Target student is female is equal to one if the migrant reports the target student is female and
zero if migrant reports the target student is male.
Target student age is the migrant’s report of the target student’s age.
Target student is migrant’s child is equal to one if the migrant reports the target student is his/her
child and zero if a different relationship is reported. It is derived from a question that asks the
migrant to describe his/her relationship with the target student.

8

Target student is migrant’s sibling is equal to one if the migrant reports the target student is
his/her sibling and zero if a different relationship is reported. It is derived from a question that
asks the migrant to describe his/her relationship with the target student.
Target student is migrant’s niece/nephew is equal to one if the migrant reports the target student
is his/her niece/nephew and zero if a different relationship is reported. It is derived from a
question that asks the migrant to describe his/her relationship with the target student.
Target student is migrant’s cousin is equal to one if the migrant reports the target student is
his/her cousin and zero if a different relationship is reported. It is derived from a question that
asks the migrant to describe his/her relationship with the target student.
Target student is in school is equal to one if the migrant reports that the target student currently
attends school and zero if the migrant reports that the target student does not currently attend
school.
Target student years of education is the target student’s total number of years of education
reported by the migrant. It is the total number of years completed for those students not currently
in school and includes the current year for those still in school. It is derived from questions about
current level of schooling and number of years within that level.
Variables from EduRemesa administrative data
EduRemesa sent is equal to one if the migrant sent at least one EduRemesa to any student and
zero otherwise.

These variable descriptions refer to the main variables from the 2012 follow-up surveys. Parallel
variables from the 2013 follow-up data are constructed in the same way, but refer to 2013 instead
of 2012.
Target student expenditures on education:
Spending on all categories is asked with reference to the period since January 1, 2012 (2013 for
second follow-up) and then annualized in the manner described below for each category. For all
categories both target students and the responsible adult were asked if there were expenditures in
each category. If yes, they were asked how much was spent. The student report is given priority
and the responsible adult report is used when the student report is missing. If both are missing,
the value is imputed to allow for consistent sample size. Imputations were performed by
regressing expenditure in each category on student age, gender, whether student is in school, the
type of school, education level, and number of people 22 and under in the student’s household
using the control group. The data comes from the student reports in El Salvador follow-up
survey. This regression is then used to predict values for the missing values in each expenditure
category.
Target student expenditure on:
Tuition is the annual amount spent on tuition for the target student. It is sum of two
categories: annual tuition paid in a lump sum at the beginning of the school and monthly
tuition paid every month. Monthly tuition report is multiplied by ten (for ten month
school year) to arrive at annual figure.

Total household expenditures on education:
Spending on all categories is asked with reference to the period since January 1, 2012 (2013 for
second follow-up) and then annualized in the manner described below for each category. For all
categories amounts are the target student amount described above plus the amount spent on each
additional child in the household in that expenditure category. The additional student reports
come from the responsible adult. For each category and for each additional child the responsible
adult was asked if there were expenditures in each category. If yes, they are asked how much
was spent. If report is missing, the value is imputed to allow for consistent sample size.
Imputations were performed by regressing expenditure in each category on additional student
age, gender, whether student is in school, the type of school, education level, and number of
people 22 and under in the student’s household using the control group. The data comes from the
adult reports in El Salvador follow-up survey. This regression is then used to predict values for
the missing values in each expenditure category.
Total household expenditure on:

Total household education expenditures is the sum of all the preceding household education
expenditure variables.
At least one imputed value:

2013: 5.9%
Target student education outcomes:
Target student is in school is equal to one if the target student reports he/she is currently
attending school and zero if he/she reports that he/she is not.
Target student is in any private school is equal to one if the target student reports that he/she
attends either parochial school or non-parochial private school. It is equal to zero if target student
reports attending public school or the target student is not currently in school.
Target student is in parochial school is equal to one if the target student reports that he/she
attends parochial school. It is equal to zero if target student reports attending non-parochial
private school, public school, or the target student is not currently in school.
Target student is in other private school is equal to one if the target student reports that he/she
attends a non-parochial private school. It is equal to zero if target student reports attending
parochial private school, public school, or the target student is not currently in school.
Target student labor force outcomes:
Paid work is equal to one if the target student reports currently spending time working at a job
where he/she receives pay and zero otherwise.

14

Average hours per week paid work is the number of weekly hours the target student reports
spending on average at the job(s) where he/she receives pay. It is equal to zero for target students
who said they did not perform paid work.
Unpaid work is equal to one if the target student reports currently spending time working at a job
where he/she does not receive pay and zero otherwise.
Average hours per week unpaid work is the number of weekly hours the target student reports
spending on average at the job(s) where he/she does not receive pay. It is equal to zero for target
students who said they did not perform unpaid work.
Any work is equal to one if the target student reports doing any work and zero otherwise. It is
derived from responses to paid work and unpaid work.
Average hours per week any work is the number of weekly hours the target student reports
spending on average at any job. It is the sum of average hours per week paid work and average
hours per week unpaid work.
Variables from the migrant follow-up survey
Remittances sent by migrant:
All remittance variables refer to the total amount sent by the migrant since January 1, 2012. For
each category (regular and special occasion remittances to the target household and other
households) missing values are imputed to ensure consistent sample size. Imputations are done
by regressing the amount in each category on migrant age, migrant gender, years the migrant has
been in the US, annual regular and special occasion remittances to the target household and other
households, migrant years of education, an indicator variable for whether or not the migrant’s
spouse is in the US, the number of children the migrant has living in the US, and an indicator
variable for whether or not the migrant has a child under 23 living in El Salvador using the
control group. The data comes from the baseline survey. This regression is then used to predict
values for the missing values.
Remittances to target household is the total amount sent by the migrant to the target household
since January 1, 2012. This equals the number of regular remittances sent since January 1, 2012
multiplied by the average amount of each remittance, plus the total amounts reported to have
been sent for special occasions in various categories since January 1, 2012. This figure does not
include any funds that may have been sent as an EduRemesa.
Imputed value: 16.2%
Remittance to other households is the total amount sent by the migrant to households that are not
the target household since January 1, 2012. This equals the number of regular remittances sent to
other households since January 1, 2012 multiplied by the average amount per regular remittance
for each household, plus the total amounts reported to have been sent for special occasions in

15

various categories. This figure does not include any funds that may have been sent as an
EduRemesa.
Imputed value: 4.6%
Overall total is the sum of remittances to the target household and to other household.
Imputed value: 19.6%
Inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of remittance variables is the three above remittance
variables transformed as follows: log(yi+(yi2+1)1/2).

Online Appendix C: Discussion and Additional Analyses
In this online appendix we provide additional discussion and analyses to clarify the
interpretation of results. We also report on results of an additional treatment.
Ruling out marketing effects
One might be concerned that some other aspect of the 3:1 match treatment is contributing
to the observed increase in education expenditures, aside from the EduRemesa funds provided. In
particular, participants received encouragement to channel remittances to education as part of the
marketing of the EduRemesa, so it is possible that some of the increase in expenditures could be
the result of a marketing effect.
Our experiment was designed precisely to eliminate such concerns. While migrants in the
control group did not receive the offer of an EduRemesa, they did receive a flyer that suggested
ways migrants could enhance remittance impacts on education that highlighted the features of the
EduRemesa (specifically, the flyer suggested sending funds directly to the sponsored student and
disbursing funds in monthly installments).
In addition, we can compare the results in the 3:1 match group to the no match group where
the EduRemesa was also offered but without subsidy. The marketing effect should be the same in
both groups, while take up was zero in the no match group, so the difference in outcomes between
these groups should only be due to the EduRemesa funds received. Across most of the outcomes
where the 3:1 match treatment had a statistically significant effect (target student education
expenditures, household education expenditures, and the labor supply outcomes), the 3:1 match
effect is also statistically significantly different from the effect of the no match treatment. The
exception to this is the impact on private school attendance. We therefore view the results as ruling
out the possibility that the 3:1 match effect is partly due to the encouragement to invest in education
that was part of the marketing of the EduRemesa. 1
Relative magnitudes of the 3:1 and 1:1 match treatment effects
We focus most of our attention on the substantial impacts of the 3:1 match, but it is also
important to consider these effects next to the effects of the 1:1 match. Take up was highest in the
3:1 match group, but it was also positive in the 1:1 group. For example, take up for target students

1

We also note that the marketing treatments were administered to the migrants, not the family members. If the
marketing of the EduRemesa increased migrant interest in promoting education in target student households, we
would expect to see increases in remittances sent to these households. But as discussed above, we find no increase in
remittances sent by migrants to the target households.

17

was 6% in the 1:1 group compared to 15% in the 3:1 match group (Table 3, column 5). Given this
level of take up and the large effects of the 3:1 treatment, one might have expected to see positive,
but smaller, effects of the 1:1 treatment on expenditures and other outcomes. We do find this for
some key outcomes: the 1:1 match increases tuition expenditures and reduces labor supply (point
estimates are smaller in magnitude than those of the 3:1 match, but not statistically significantly
so). However, we do not find statistically significant increases in total target student expenditures
due to the 1:1 match (although the coefficient on total expenditures for the 1:1 match treatment in
column 1 of Table 5 is positive.) Looking across outcome variables, the broad pattern of these
findings is that the 1:1 match also has positive effects but that are smaller in magnitude and less
often statistically significant compared to the effects of the 3:1 match.
EduRemesa with and without monitoring of beneficiary student grades
During the first stage randomization migrants offered the EduRemesa were randomized
into being offered one of two versions of the product: half of migrants were randomly assigned to
be offered a version of the EduRemesa where they would receive official reports of their
beneficiary students’ grades at the end of every grading period (“EduRemesa with grades”), and
the remaining migrants were offered the EduRemesa without this grade reporting (“EduRemesa
without grades”).
We included this randomization to test whether the impact of the EduRemesa offer could
be enhanced by providing the migrant improved monitoring of student performance. We
hypothesized that migrants offered the EduRemesa with grades might take up the product at higher
rates. In addition, conditional on taking up, the EduRemesa with grades could have provided
greater incentive for households to spend more on education.
Online Appendix Table 11 analyzes take up separately for the EduRemesa with grades and
the EduRemesa without grades. Take up in the 3:1 match group does not vary by whether or not
the migrant was offered grade reports, and this is true across all measures of take up. The similarity
in treatment effects for the EduRemesa with and without grades is also evident in the analysis of
target student educational expenditures (Online Appendix Table 12). The only evidence of
differences across the EduRemesa with and without grades is in take up in the 1:1 match group,
which is higher for the EduRemesa without grades. It is not obvious why the EduRemesa without
grades would have led to higher take up, but we speculate that migrants may have not wanted to
bear the effort cost of monitoring students in El Salvador that would be expected with the

18

EduRemesa with grades treatment. We do not place great emphasis on this result, however, since
the corresponding pattern (higher take up for the EduRemesa without grades) does not hold for the
3:1 match treatment. Overall, we conclude from this analysis that migrants do not appear to place
value on monitoring the performance of students funded via the EduRemesa.

19

Online Appendix D: Longer-Term Impacts
In this section we present the results of the second follow-up survey intended to study the
longer-term impacts of the EduRemesa program. Because the EduRemesa transfers were offered
only for the 2012 school year, this longer-term follow-up, conducted at the end of the 2013 school
year, examines impacts on behavior after the EduRemesa transfers have ended. The second followup was almost identical in content to the first, and was also conducted over the phone, but was
limited to the target student and a knowledgeable adult. Because the second follow-up survey
instrument was similar to the first, we are able to replicate the same analyses, using the same
econometric specifications. A larger degree of attrition resulted in a smaller estimation sample for
the second follow-up (459 target students), but in Online Appendix Table 13, we show that attrition
is not related to treatment for the combined student-adult sample or either sample separately. The
combined sample will be used for all analyses in this section. Table structure is as in the main
analysis.
Online Appendix Table 14 reports the effect of the EduRemesa treatments on annualized
target student education expenditure for 2013. Although the coefficients are imprecise, the pattern
and magnitude of the results are similar to the results in Table 5 for expenditures in 2012,
suggesting that the EduRemesa may have led families to maintain this higher level of expenditures
even after the transfer ended. However, only two coefficients are statistically significantly different
from zero at the 10% level (food expenditures for the 3:1 match and tuition expenditures for the
1:1 match) so very little should be interpreted from these results. It should also be noted that while
the impact of the 3:1 match treatment on total target student expenditures is larger in magnitude
for females than for males, this difference is much more subtle than in the results in Table 5, and
again, neither coefficient is statistically significant.
The impacts of the EduRemesa treatments on household education expenditures in 2013
are presented in Online Appendix Table 15. Again, the same very rough pattern of results from
Table 6 is present, but the standard errors are even larger here than in the estimates presented in
Online Appendix Table 14, and the coefficients are not stable across treatments and subsamples.
Overall, the results on educational expenditures, both at the target student and household level, are
somewhat suggestive of continued impacts, but due to lack of power no definitive conclusions can
or should be drawn from the results. Given the lack of a first stage in these analyses, we do not

20

repeat the instrumental variables regressions from Table 7 with the data from the second followup.
Online Appendix Table 16 shows the estimates for the impact of the EduRemesa treatments
on target student education outcomes in the second follow-up sample. Again, the coefficients are
imprecise due to our small sample, but, as in the first follow-up, there is no evidence that the
EduRemesa treatments affect whether or not a target student is in school (column 1). In contrast
to the first follow-up, here the point estimate for whether or not a target student is in private school
(column 2) is close to zero in the pooled sample. That point estimate is however larger in
magnitude and positive in the female sub-sample only, which is more consistent with the results
from the first follow-up round. This would suggest that some of the female target students who
switched to private school because of the EduRemesa were able to stay in private school for the
2013 school year. However, again, none of these coefficients are statistically significant and the
confidence intervals are large enough to encompass a wide range of possible outcomes.
As a final analysis using the second follow-up, we analyze the impact of the EduRemesa
treatments on student labor force participation in 2013. The results are shown in Online Appendix
Table 17. Here, as in the other analyses, there are not statistically significant results for labor force
participation either on the extensive or the intensive margin. In contrast to the large impacts found
for both male and female target students in 2012 (Table 9), not only are the coefficients for 2013
imprecise, but they are also much smaller in magnitude than in 2012, suggesting that the labor
supply effects did not, in fact, persist into 2013.
