Expanding the School Breakfast Program: Impacts on Children's Consumption, Nutrition
and Health
Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach and Mary Zaki
NBER Working Paper No. 20308
July 2014
JEL No. I12,I21
ABSTRACT
School meals programs are the front line of defense against childhood hunger, and while the school
lunch program is nearly universally available in U.S. public schools, the school breakfast program
has lagged behind in terms of availability and participation. In this paper we use experimental data
collected by the USDA to measure the impact of two popular policy innovations aimed at increasing
access to the school breakfast program. The first, universal free school breakfast, provides a hot breakfast
before school (typically served in the school’s cafeteria) to all students regardless of their income eligibility
for free or reduced-price meals. The second is the Breakfast in the Classroom (BIC) program that provides
free school breakfast to all children to be eaten in the classroom during the first few minutes of the
school day. We find both policies increase the take-up rate of school breakfast, though much of this
reflects shifting breakfast consumption from home to school or consumption of multiple breakfasts
and relatively little of the increase is from students gaining access to breakfast. We find little evidence
of overall improvements in child 24-hour nutritional intake, health, behavior or achievement, with
some evidence of health and behavior improvements among specific subpopulations.

School meals programs are a front line of defense against childhood hunger, particularly for the
22.4 percent of children who live in households that experience food insecurity. While the school lunch
program has long been nearly universally offered, availability of the school breakfast program (SBP) has
lagged behind. There have been recent – and highly successful – attempts to expand access to the SBP. For
example, between 1989 and 2000 the total number of breakfasts served doubled (McLaughlin et al. 2002).
According to our calculations from NHANES data, as of 2009-10 almost three-quarters of children attend a
school that offers the SBP, up from approximately half of students in the 1988-94 wave.
A large research literature supports the commonly held notion that breakfast is an important meal.
Children who skip breakfast have lower nutrient and energy intake across the day – in other words, they do
not make up for the skipped meal by consuming more calories later in the day. Briefel et al. (1999)
summarize the research evidence on cognitive impacts, and conclude “skipping breakfast interferes with
cognition and learning, and that this effect is more pronounced in poorly nourished children.” Despite the
importance of breakfast, only 86 percent of elementary school children aged, and 75 percent of children
aged 12-19, consume any type of breakfast on a typical day (USDA ARS, 2010).
Policy makers have long been troubled by the low take-up rate of the SBP, which was 26 percent
in 2010 (compared with a 63 percent participation rate in the school lunch program, see Fox et al. 2013).
This is in part troubling because there is evidence that school breakfast is nutritionally superior to breakfast
at home (Bhattacharya et al. 2006; Devaney and Stuart 1998; Millimet et al. 2010). Two factors appear to
drive the low take-up of breakfast: stigma and timing. Recent policy innovations have attempted to
ameliorate these barriers to participation.
To address (perceived) stigma associated with participation in the school breakfast program, some
districts have offered universal free school breakfast instead of the standard program that provides free
breakfast only to students who are income-eligible for a subsidy.1 There is some evidence, described below,
that this policy change increases take-up rates. The limitation remains, however, that in order to participate
in the breakfast program a student generally has to arrive at school prior to the start of classes and this is
reported to be an important barrier for some children. To address this, another recent policy innovation has

programs.

been to serve breakfast in the classroom (BIC) during the first few minutes of the school day. BIC
eliminates the need for students to arrive to school early to participate in the school breakfast program, and
dramatically increases participation in the SBP (FRAC 2009; FNS undated). This program has recently
gained momentum, with major expansions in cities such as Washington, D.C., Houston, New York City,
Chicago, San Diego and Memphis.
In this paper we re-analyze experimental data previously collected by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture to measure the impact of these two popular policy innovations: universal free breakfast, and
breakfast in the classroom. As described below, re-analysis of the data is necessary because the original
evaluation of the experiment was incomplete. In particular, it did not separately estimate the impacts of the
two policies even though the experimental design allowed such estimates to be conducted. In this reanalysis, we calculate experimental estimates of both the impact of universal free cafeteria breakfast and
the impact of BIC.
We extend the analysis in three additional directions. First, in order to improve statistical power of
the analysis and following the recent program evaluation literature (Kling et al. 2007; Anderson 2008;
Hoynes et al. 2012), we combine similar outcomes into summary indexes covering areas such as nutrition
at breakfast, nutrition over 24 hours, and child health outcomes. Second, we implement an instrumental
variables approach to estimate the causal impact of eating breakfast on student outcomes. Third, in an
appendix we address the policy decision facing a school district by constructing difference-in-difference
estimates of the relative effectiveness of BIC compared with universally free cafeteria breakfast.
I.

Literature Review
Two recent types of policy innovations have attempted to increase breakfast takeup, and there has

been recent evidence on their impacts using a variety of difference-in-differences research designs. The
first type of policy is the introduction of universal free breakfast, which allows children to participate in the
school breakfast program at no charge regardless of whether they are typically eligible for free or reducedprice school meals. Ribar and Haldeman (2013) study the introduction and discontinuation of universal free
school breakfasts in Guilford County, North Carolina, and find that take-up of school breakfast increases by
12 to 16 percentage points when the program is universally free of charge. While most of the increased
participation was among students formerly ineligible for subsidized meals, they also find an increase

3

among those who were eligible for free meals all along. When the program was discontinued, there were no
changes in attendance rates or test scores. Leos-Urbel et al. (2013) compare New York City public schools
that implement universal free school breakfast to those that retain the traditional program in a tripledifference framework. They find strong impacts on participation but no impacts on student test scores, and
a small positive impact on attendance for some subgroups.
The second area of recent policy innovation is offering breakfast in the classroom during the
school day. Imberman and Kugler (2014) investigate the very short-term impacts of the introduction of a
BIC program in a large urban school district in the southwestern United States. The program was
introduced on a rolling basis across schools, and the earliest-adopting schools had the program in place for
up to 9 weeks before the state’s annual standardized test was administered. They find an increase in both
reading and math test scores, but no impact on grades or attendance. Additionally, there was no difference
in impact between those schools that had adopted the program for only one week vs. those that had the
program for a longer time. The pattern in the results led the authors to conclude that the test score impacts
were driven by short-term cognitive gains on the day of the test due to eating breakfast and not underlying
learning gains.2 Dotter (2012), on the other hand, finds stronger longer-run impacts of the staggered
introduction of a BIC program in elementary schools in San Diego. Using a difference-in-differences
approach, he finds that BIC increases test scores in math and reading by 0.15 and 0.10 standard deviations,
respectively. He finds no test score impacts on schools that previously had universal free breakfast, and no
impacts on attendance rates. As shown below, our results from the randomized experiment are consistent
with the earlier literature in that we find no consistent attendance impacts.3 On the other hand, we also find
no positive impact of BIC on test scores and can rule out effect sizes as large as those found in the earlier,
quasi-experimental literature.

2

This interpretation is consistent with earlier research by Figlio and Winicki (2005), which found that
schools with much at stake in a test-based accountability system served higher-calorie lunches during
testing weeks.

We find modest positive attendance impacts in year 3 only.

II.

Empirical Approach
This paper uses data from a randomized experiment implemented in 153 schools across 6 school

districts designed to test the impact of universal free school breakfast.4 That is, at baseline all schools in the
experiment at least offered the standard school breakfast program. Control group schools continued to offer
the standard program, which serves free or reduced-price (maximum price of 30 cents) breakfast to those
that are income-eligible and can be purchased at full price for those ineligible for a meal subsidy (current
average price $1.13, Fox et al. 2013). The breakfast is typically served before school in the cafeteria.
Treatment schools offered school breakfast free of charge to all students regardless of their usual eligibility
for subsidized meals.5 The experimental design first matched schools into pairs (or occasionally groups of 3
schools), and then treatment status was randomly assigned within the pair. There are 70 matched pairs in
the experiment, which we call “randomization pools” because random assignment is done within each of
these 70 pairs. After randomization occurred, the treatment schools got to choose whether to implement
their universal school breakfast as a traditional program – that is, in the cafeteria before school – or as a
BIC program. The treatment lasted for 3 years.
The original evaluation found that treatment schools nearly doubled their SBP participation, and
that students in treatment schools were 4 percentage points more likely to consume a “nutritionally
substantive breakfast.” There were no statistically significant impacts on most other measures of food
intake, food security, student health, or achievement outcomes.

A.

The Need for Re-analysis
In the original evaluations of the experiment (Bernstein et al. 2004), outcomes were presented

separately for the overall treatment and control groups, and then the treatment group outcomes were
presented separately by whether they adopted a cafeteria-based or classroom program. But it is
inappropriate to compare the separate treatment groups to a pooled control group, and may lead to biased

4

The experiment was conducted by the USDA in conjunction with Abt Associates from 1999 through 2003
and was entitled the School Breakfast Pilot Project. We obtained the public-use data by requesting it from
USDA.

Under normal circumstances, a child is eligible for free meals if his or her family’s income is less than or
equal to 130 percent of the poverty threshold, and is eligible for reduced-price meals if the family income is
less than or equal to 185 percent of the poverty threshold.

estimates of the policy impacts if different types of schools selected into cafeteria vs. classroom breakfast
programs. In practice, this is an important concern because there is evidence that the treatment schools
differed prior to program implementation. In the year before the experiment began, schools that would go
on to implement a cafeteria-based program had a 14 percent participation rate in the SBP, while those that
would opt for a BIC program had a 22 percent participation rate (see Table 1). As shown below, the two
types of treatment schools also differed along other characteristics such as rates of disadvantage. As a
result, impact estimates separately comparing them to a pooled control group may be seriously biased.
Appropriate impact estimates can be constructed, though. As described above, in the experimental
protocol schools were first paired on observable characteristics and then treatment or control status was
randomly assigned within pairs. Subsequently, treatment schools were allowed to choose the location of
their universal school breakfast program. The design of the experiment is represented in Figure 1, below.
Since random assignment was conducted within treatment pairs, it is possible to measure the causal impact
of the universal cafeteria breakfast and the causal impact of BIC by comparing each treatment group to its
matched control group. To graphically demonstrate how to estimate the impact of the program in this
experimental design, see that outcomes for groups should be compared vertically. That is, the impact of a
universal cafeteria breakfast could be estimated as the difference between A and A’. Similarly, the impact
of the BIC program can be estimated as the difference between B and B’. Of course, the overall impact of
universal school breakfast (regardless of location) can be estimated as the difference between average
outcomes in the set A + B compared to those in the control group A’+B’.

Surprisingly, the official USDA evaluation failed to provide the experimental impacts separately
for BIC vs. cafeteria-based programs. Below, we first reanalyze the data using the appropriate control
group. This will allow us to make separate conclusions about the impacts of a universal cafeteria breakfast
and universal breakfast in the classroom, which to date have not been known because of the limitations of
the original analysis.

Outcomes to be measured
Many prior analyses of school breakfast programs are limited by the outcome variables that are

available. Among the quasi-experimental literature, studies have looked either at take-up (Ribar and
Haldeman, 2013), or academic achievement (Frisvold 2012; Imberman and Kugler 2014; Dotter 2012), or
detailed nutrition outcomes (Bhattacharya et al. 2006), or a combination of take-up and achievement (LeosUrbel et al. 2013). To our knowledge, no paper in the prior literature has access to all of these outcomes in
the same dataset. Not only do we have detailed information on a range of outcomes, but we also have three
years of outcome data, allowing us to investigate the impacts of the programs as they mature.
We start by analyzing the impact of each of the programs on take-up, and how the impacts vary
across characteristics such as prior income-eligibility for free breakfast, gender, race, and other
characteristics that were measured prior to the experiment. Next, we turn to nutrition and health outcomes.
We measure whether a student consumed any breakfast, or consumed a “nutritionally adequate” breakfast
as defined in the prior literature. We also measure whether a student consumes two breakfasts (typically,
one at home and one at school), and the household’s food security status. We analyze consumption of total
calories and micronutrient intake as percent of RDA and measure these both for breakfast and over a 24hour period. For measures of student health, we have parent-reported health status, and height and weight
(from which we calculate BMI and obesity). Finally, we analyze behavioral and cognitive measures such as
test scores, school attendance, and tardiness.
Because we observe many outcome variables and in order to increase statistical precision, we
follow the recent literature (e.g. Kling, Liebman and Katz 2007; Anderson 2008; Hoynes, Schanzenbach
and Almond 2012) and estimate summary standardized indices that aggregate information over multiple
treatments. The summary index is the simple average across standardized z-score measures of each
component. The z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the
pooled control group. In particular, we form five indices. Two nutrition indices cover nutrient intake at
breakfast and over 24-hours, respectively. The health outcomes index includes parent-reported health
status, whether the child has a chronic health problem, and (separate) indicators for whether the child is

7

obese or overweight6. The behavior measures include measures of whether a student is inattentive, defiant,
and so on. Finally, the index of academic outcomes combines math and reading test scores across the three
years of the experiment. Summary statistics of the five indices and their component parts are presented in
Appendix Table 1.

C.

Impact of SBP participation and Breakfast Consumption
We address whether participation in the SBP improves student outcomes. There are conflicting

and sometimes perverse-signed impact estimates in the literature (summarized in Briefel et al. 1999, also
Waehrer 2007), though most prior studies have been correlational.7 The prior literature is severely limited
because there are few research designs available to isolate the causal impact of SBP participation on
outcomes.
We are also able to make statements about the causal impact of breakfast consumption by using
the experimental data and an instrumental variables approach. In particular, we use a school’s random
assignment to treatment status to instrument for a student’s breakfast consumption. This will allow us to
estimate the impact of breakfast consumption on the so-called “compliers” in a local average treatment
effect framework – that is, the impact on students who were induced to eat a breakfast in the program by
the universal school breakfast policy (Angrist and Pischke 2009). The impacts of the program on this group
are of particular interest to policy makers.

Results

A.

Validity of the Experiment
Table 1 presents means of pre-determined characteristics across the treatment and control groups.

As described above, we present three groups of estimates: first the pooled results for the impact of
universal free breakfast regardless of the type of program adopted, then separately those for the BIC
experiment and cafeteria-based experiment. The first two columns in each set of results presents means for

Following the standard CDC definition, a student is defined as “overweight” or “obese” if he/she is at or
above the 85th or 95th percentile, respectively, of a standardized BMI distribution.

the control and treatment groups, respectively. The third column presents the p-value of a test for whether
the means are the same across groups after conditioning on randomization pool fixed effects. In general, the
treatment and control groups are well-balanced across background characteristics, with no statistically
significant differences for the pooled group or the cafeteria group. Among the BIC group, however, there is
a small difference in student-level eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch, with the treatment group being
slightly less disadvantaged than the control group. The differences are not statistically significant across
other measures of disadvantage, such as family income less than $20,000 per year, minority status, or
whether the student is from a single parent household. Our subsequent analyses are largely unchanged if we
control for these background characteristics. There are no significant differences in school-level
characteristics (shown in panel B). Note that the schools in the BIC sample are substantially more
disadvantaged than the cafeteria sample. Among the control groups, 61 percent of the BIC group is eligible
for free or reduced-price lunch, compared with 51 percent of the cafeteria-based group. When restricted to
free lunch only, the rates are 45 and 34 percent, respectively. Furthermore, students in the BIC control
group take up school breakfasts in 22% of school days in the base year as compared to 14% for the
cafeteria-based group. These differences underscore the need to compare the BIC treatment group to the
appropriate control group.

B.

Outcomes
Table 2 shows results for participation and nutrition intake during the first year of the experiment.

The table presents coefficients on an indicator for treatment group in a regression that controls	  for	  
randomization-­‐pool	  fixed	  effects	  and	  the	  following	  covariates:	  free	  and	  reduced	  lunch	  eligibility,	  
household	  income,	  race,	  single	  parent	  household,	  gender	  and	  age. Standard errors (adjusted for
homoscedasticity at the school level) are shown in parentheses. Participation is measured as the proportion
of days that a student has taken a school breakfast, whether or not the child took the school breakfast on the
day that the nutrition information was collected. The overall (pooled) impact on SBP participation is 18
percentage points, a near doubling of participation compared with the control group. There is a substantial
difference in treatment effects, however, across program type. The BIC program increased year 1
participation by 38 percentage points, or a 144 percent increase in participation. The cafeteria-based

9

program also significantly increases participation, but by a more modest 10.5 percentage points, or a 52
percent increase in rate. Since breakfasts are reimbursed on a per-pupil basis, a child’s participation in SBP
determines the total cost of the program. Another way to measure participation is whether a child “usually”
takes a school breakfast. When we define “usually” as participation in 75 percent or more days, the impacts
on participation are even larger in percentage terms. The impacts are a 13 percentage-point increase in
participation in the pooled sample (an increase of over 160 percent), and 29 percentage points in the BIC
sample (a 242 percent increase). These increases in program participation could reflect students going from
consuming no breakfast to a school breakfast, but could also reflect substitution of a home breakfast for a
school breakfast, or consumption of multiple breakfasts. The total impact on nutritional intake depends on
the extent of the substitution.
The impact on breakfast consumption varies depending on the definition of breakfast chosen.8 At
one extreme, we can define any positive caloric intake in the morning to be breakfast consumption.
According to this definition, 96 percent of the pooled control group eats some breakfast. Overall, universal
school breakfast does not change this probability, although the BIC program increases the likelihood that a
child eats any breakfast by 2 percentage points. If we implement a more stringent threshold for what counts
as breakfast – a “nutritionally substantive” breakfast that requires consumption of at least 2 food groups
and at least 15 percent of the daily allowance of calories – then the impact is stronger. The pooled impact is
an increase of 3 percentage points, compared to a control group level of 59 percent consuming that quality
level of breakfast. This is driven almost entirely by a 10 percentage-point increase among the BIC group,
with an insignificant 1 percentage-point estimate among the cafeteria-based program group.9 BIC
substantially increases both participation and the likelihood that a student actually eats breakfast, while a
universal cafeteria-based program increases participation in the program but primarily alters where – and
not whether – students eat breakfast.
The next row displays the impact on whether a student reports eating two nutritionally substantive
breakfasts, one at school and one at another location. Here again the impact is primarily driven by the BIC
8

“Breakfast” includes all foods and beverages, excluding water, consumed between 5:00 a.m. and 45
minutes after the start of school, and also any foods consumed before 10:30 a.m. that the student/parent
reported as being part of breakfast.

Impacts are similar if we use alternate definitions of breakfast commonly used in the literature, such as
consuming 2 food groups and 10 percent of RDA of calories, or consuming 3 food groups and 25 percent
of RDA of calories.

10

group, which causes a 5-point increase in eating two breakfasts. This represents more than doubling the
likelihood of eating two breakfasts. The BIC program reduces the likelihood that a student eats breakfast
only outside of school by 45 percentage points, while the universal cafeteria-based program reduces this
likelihood by 13 points.
The final set of rows report impacts on calorie and nutrient intakes, both at breakfast(s) and over a
24-hour period, as well as on food security. Consistent with the reported meal intake patterns, BIC
participants consume an additional 1.7 percent of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of calories
(adjusted for child’s age) at breakfast. There is no measured difference in calorie intake among the
cafeteria-based program group. The program does not appear to be increasing the nutrient intake at
breakfast for either treatment group.10 The 24-hour dietary impacts suggest that any increase in
consumption at breakfast is offset at other times during the day, and 24-hour calorie and nutrition intakes
are no higher for the treatment groups. Finally, neither program appears to impact household food security
status.
Overall, the universal cafeteria-based program appears to shift where students consume breakfast,
but does not substantially alter whether or how much breakfast is consumed. On the other hand, the BIC
program changes where students eat breakfast as well as how much they eat. It raises the likelihood that a
child eats any breakfast, and also raises the likelihood that he or she eats two breakfasts. Since the
cafeteria-based program does not change students’ nutritional intake, it would be surprising to find that it
impacts other outcomes. On the other hand, since BIC increases nutritional intake (both in terms of
increasing the likelihood that a child eats any breakfast, and in terms of meal quality) and also potentially
crowds out some classroom instructional time, the expected impacts are ambiguous.
Table 3 shows impacts on academic, behavioral and health outcomes during the first year of the
experiment. For completeness, we include the impacts from the pooled sample and the cafeteria-based
program, but we concentrate our discussion on the BIC results11. The BIC treatment does not statistically
significantly improve any outcome. The point estimate for the test score index is -0.052 indicating a

10

The index consists of consumption of vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, riboflavin, folate, calcium, iron,
magnesium and zinc.
11
Further analysis of the relative impact of BIC vs. cafeteria based universal breakfast programs using a
difference-in-difference approach is presented in the Appendix. Such an analysis may be useful as schools
often face the decision to introduce universal school breakfast in the cafeteria or in the classroom.

11

statistically insignificant 5 percent of a standard deviation decline in average math and reading test scores.
The standard errors allow us to reject a positive impact as small as 0.03 standard deviations, which is
smaller than the results found in the quasi-experimental literature.12 When broken out separately by subject,
the estimated impact (standard error) for math is -0.085 (0.052) and reading is -0.023 (0.037). The
estimated impact of BIC on attendance and tardiness is wrong-signed but not statistically significant. The
BIC impact on the “bad behavior index” is right-signed, in that the point estimate indicates a decrease in
misbehavior, but not statistically different from zero. There is no impact on child health as measured by
child’s (age-adjusted) BMI, an indicator for being overweight or the health index. Note that the control
group means across many of these characteristics indicate that the BIC sample is more disadvantaged than
the cafeteria-based sample.
Table 4 shows impacts for subsequent years. We define the BIC sample consistently over time
based on their status in the first year of the program, even though six BIC treatment schools switched to a
cafeteria-based program at some point during the experiment. The impact on SBP participation is relatively
stable over time, with the pooled impact essentially doubling takeup, BIC increasing takeup by about 150
percent, and the cafeteria-based program increasing it by approximately 54 percent. There is no evidence of
a positive impact on test scores, with small and insignificant impacts in year two and three, and when the
data are pooled across all 3 years of outcomes. Impacts on attendance rates are positive and significant in
year 3 only, with an estimated 1.05 percentage-point increase in attendance rate for the BIC group. The
pooled impacts on attendance rates across all 3 years, however, are small or wrong-signed and not
statistically significantly different from zero. The BIC appears to increase tardiness significantly in some
years, though, again, the magnitude of the impact is quite small (i.e. less than a day per school year).
Table 5 explores whether the BIC impacts are different across subgroups. Each triplet of columns
represents a different subgroup. The first column in each pair presents the control group mean, the second
column presents the impact of BIC treatment after conditioning on randomization pool fixed effects and
previously mentioned demographic controls and the last column presents the number of observations.
There is some variation in the impact on participation and breakfast eating. Free-lunch ineligible students

12

In order to increase precision of the estimates, we control for baseline test scores in the models. As
expected, addition of these controls does not change the impact estimates but they do reduce the standard
errors by 20-30 percent.

12

increase their participation rates by more in response to BIC than do free-lunch eligible students, but the
impact on breakfast consumption is slightly stronger among the more disadvantaged group. Similarly, BIC
increases the likelihood that boys participate in the program more than girls, but has a stronger increase on
the likelihood that a girl eats a nutritionally substantial breakfast. Among high-poverty, urban schools, BIC
increases participation by 138 percent, and increases breakfast eating by over 27 percent. Despite
differences in treatment intensity, there is no significant positive impact on test scores or attendance.13
Results are generally stable across the behavior index measure (indicating an improvement in behavior),
but only reach statistical significance among the subset of minority students. However, the BIC treatment
statistically significantly increases health and decreases the incidence of overweight when the sample is
limited to certain sub-populations, such as students who attend high-poverty, urban schools.

C.

Impact of Eating Breakfast
An elusive question in the literature has been what is the impact of eating breakfast – whether at

home or school – on a child’s outcomes. As shown in Table 2 above, being randomly assigned to the BIC
treatment increases the likelihood that a student consumes breakfast. We can thus use the school’s random
assignment to BIC as an instrument for breakfast consumption, and estimate the causal impact of breakfast
consumption. It is important to emphasize that this is a local average treatment effect, and provides an
estimate of the causal impact of breakfast consumption for those students who were induced to start eating
breakfast because of the treatment. Results are presented in Table 6, and are limited only to the BIC sample
(i.e. the randomization pools in which the treatment group participated in BIC).
The first triplet of columns shows results for a nutritionally substantial breakfast (i.e., as before
this includes consumption of food from 2 food groups and at least 15 percent of daily RDA of calories).
The first column shows the OLS relationship between breakfast eating and a variety of outcomes, after
controlling for other background characteristics. Consistent with the prior literature, eating breakfast is
correlated with better dietary outcomes. Eating breakfast is associated with a 0.46 standard deviation
increase in nutritional intake as measured by the 24-hour micronutrient index, and a 16 percentage-point
increase in daily calories as a percent of RDA. There is no systematic relationship in these data between
13

We constructed the urban, high-poverty sample to be similar to the sample used in Dotter (2012) and we
can rule out impacts as large as he finds on test scores.

13

breakfast eating and child’s BMI, or whether the child is overweight. There is also no statistically
significant association between breakfast eating and child outcomes such as behavior, attendance or test
scores.
Moving to column 2, we can estimate the causal impact of being induced to eat a substantive
breakfast by the BIC program. The instrument predicts a 10-point increase in breakfast eating, and is a
strong predictor with an F-statistic of over 16. Instrumenting for breakfast consumption flips the signs of
most of the estimates, suggesting that the correlations in the OLS results are largely driven by selection.
The standard errors are quite large and most of the IV estimates are not statistically significantly different
from zero. Nonetheless, the point estimates from the IV results for behavior, health and overweight status
suggest that eating breakfast may improve these outcomes. On the other hand, the estimates on attendance,
and test scores become more negative when instrumented.
Instead of defining breakfast as a binary variable equal to one if consumption is at or above a
floor, an alternative measure of breakfast, displayed in columns (4) and (5), is the total calorie consumption
in the morning. In this case, the instrument is considerably weaker with an F-statistic of 4.8. Results are
generally similar as those in the first two columns, with the point estimates in the IV results suggesting
declines in overweight and bad behavior but wrong-signed, though small, estimates on attendance and test
scores. The standard errors are large and none of the estimates are statistically significantly different from

Discussion and Conclusions
The USDA implemented an extremely important experiment on the impacts of making school

breakfast uniformly available at no cost, both in the cafeteria before school and in the classroom. Our
reanalysis isolated the impact of each of these programs on nutrition, health, attendance and achievement.
We find that expanding the school breakfast program substantially increases program takeup, especially
under the BIC treatment. Furthermore, universal free school breakfast and BIC also increase the likelihood
that a child eats a nutritionally substantive breakfast. BIC also increases the likelihood that a child eats two
breakfasts. The additional consumption appears to be offset across the rest of the day, so there is no
measurable impact on 24-hour nutrition as measured by calories or nutritional intake.

14

Despite the increase in breakfast consumption under BIC, we find no positive impact on most
other outcomes. In contrast to the earlier, quasi-experimental literature, we find no positive impact on test
scores and some evidence of negative impacts. Similarly, there appears to be no overall positive impact on
attendance rates or child health. There is suggestive evidence that BIC may improve behavior and health in
some highly disadvantaged subgroups, though.
Of course, the results should be viewed with the important caveat that our results do not indicate
that the school breakfast program is not effective. There is already a reasonably high program participation
rate among the control group, and a higher breakfast consumption rate among the control group, indicating
that some children who do not participate in the school program eat breakfast at home. In other words, our
results do not shed light on what would happen if the school breakfast program were reduced or eliminated,
nor do they suggest that reducing or eliminating the school breakfast program is warranted. The results
speak only to attempts to further expand the program, through universal access or BIC programs. These
results indicate that much of the increase in program participation induced by program expansions
represents substitution from consumption of breakfast at home to school. A substantial share of children is
induced to start consuming breakfast by the program, and a slightly smaller share is induced to consume
two breakfasts. The relatively modest measured benefits suggest that policy-makers should carefully
consider how to trade these off against the increased program costs.

Appendix
Difference-in-difference estimates
The more relevant policy question for a school or district considering implementing a universal
school breakfast program is the relative effectiveness of a traditional cafeteria-based school breakfast
relative to breakfast in the classroom. To experimentally address this policy question, schools would need
to have been randomly assigned across these groups. Referring back to Figure 1, this would mean that
schools should have been randomly assigned to columns in addition to rows (i.e. randomly assigned to
group A or group B). Under a design like this, a simple difference-in-difference estimate (i.e. comparing
outcomes across cells [A – A’] – [B – B’] = δ) would yield an unbiased estimate of the relative impact of
universal breakfast in the cafeteria vs. the classroom.
Unfortunately, schools were not randomly assigned but instead self-selected into treatment type.
Under the arguably palatable assumption that schools choose the program that will improve their outcomes
the most, we can estimate an upper bound on the relative effectiveness of the two types of universal
breakfast programs by comparing effect sizes across the groups. The relative effect of a classroom vs.
cafeteria universal program is an important policy-relevant question, with little evidence to date on it.
Therefore we calculate the difference-in-difference estimates, attempting to estimate the relative
effectiveness of BIC compared to a cafeteria-based program, even though this parameter is not
experimentally identified.
We calculate the difference-in-difference estimates, comparing each treatment type to its randomly
assigned control group, then test for differences in impact across the two treatment types. Results are
shown in Appendix Table 2. Most notably, BIC increases participation relative to universal cafeteria
breakfast by an average of 28 percentage points. Similarly, BIC increases the likelihood of actually eating
breakfast (not merely participating in the program) by between 2 and 8 percentage points depending on the
definition of breakfast. It also raises the likelihood that a child eats two breakfasts by 5 points relative to the
cafeteria-based program. On the other hand, there are signs that the cafeteria-based program, relative to the
BIC program, increases the likelihood that a child is not tardy (by around 1.2 days over a 180-day school
year according to the pooled-year results). This makes sense, as participation in the cafeteria-based
program requires a child be present at school before school starts. Since there are few statistically

18

significant impacts of universal breakfast, the difference-in-differences estimates also show no impact of
BIC relative to a cafeteria breakfast on other nutrition, health, attendance, behavior or achievement
outcomes.
