ABSTRACT
Which firms issue equity and debt in domestic and international markets and what happens to their
assets, sales, and number of employees? To answer these questions, we assemble a new dataset on
firm-level capital raising activity during 1991-2011, which we match with firm attributes for 45,527
listed firms from 51 economies during 2003-2011. We find that only a few of the largest firms issue
securities in the median country. Firms issuing bonds are even larger than those issuing equity. Moreover,
issuers grow much faster than non-issuers, particularly (a) during the year of issuance, (b) among smaller
and younger firms, and (c) in countries with market-based financial systems. Furthermore, the firm
size distribution (FSD) of issuers behaves differently from that of non-issuers. Among issuers, smaller
firms grow faster than larger ones, tightening their FSD; but among non-issuers, larger firms grow
faster than smaller ones, widening their FSD.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we address two questions related to capital market development and firm financing
around the world. First, which firms issue debt and equity in domestic and international markets?
Second, what happens to assets, sales, and the number of employees of firms that issue securities
relative to non-issuers? Though very basic, these questions have not been answered using a broad
cross-section of countries over an extensive period of time. We thus assess these questions by
documenting several new patterns concerning capital market financing, firm growth, and the
associated evolution of the firm size distribution (FSD). We also discuss how these findings relate
and contribute to several strands of research in finance and economics.
To investigate these questions, we assemble a new dataset on firm-level capital market
issuance activity during the period from 1991 through 2011, which we match with data on firm
attributes for 45,527 listed firms from 51 countries over the period from 2003 to 2011. We then
study which firms use securities markets to issue and how they perform during a period of
exceptionally rapid capital market development around the world. For instance, between 1991-1995
and 2006-2011 the stock market capitalization as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP)
rose from 35% to 84% for the median developed country and from 17% to 59% for the median
emerging country. Over the same period, the annual amount raised through equity or corporate
bond offerings as a percentage of GDP almost doubled for the median country.
We find, first, that for the median country only a small number of large firms issue equity or
bonds, and among these issuing firms a small subset receives the majority of funds raised through
security issuances. Namely, in the median country, about only 20 listed firms per year issue securities
in either their domestic capital market or in an international financial center. Moreover, of these few
issuers, the top-5 firms receive over 66% of the funds raised through bond issuances and over 77%
of the funds raised through equity issuances. We also find that bond issuers are much larger than
1

equity issuers. The median listed firm that conducts an equity offering is more than twice as large (as
measured by total assets) as the median non-issuing firm. But the median bond-issuing firm is more
than 36 times as large as the median non-issuing firm. Issuers of equity and bonds are larger than
non-issuers at every decile of the FSD; the distribution of issuing firms lies to the right of nonissuing firms.
Second, issuers grow faster than non-issuers in terms of assets, sales, and employment. For
example, the median issuer by size experiences asset growth of 12% per annum, while the median
non-issuer grows at 4.5%. Similar patterns are observed for the average sized issuers and non-issuers
and for other deciles of the FSD. Consequently, the FSD of issuing firms moves more to the right
over time than that of non-issuing firms. Moreover, issuers experience a significant boost in assets,
sales, and employment in the year they sell securities.
Third, the additional average growth of issuers (relative to non-issuers) is not homogeneous
along the FSD. The positive growth gap between issuers and non-issuers is particularly pronounced
among smaller firms. Although firm age and firm size are correlated and younger firms tend to grow
faster than older ones (Cooley and Quadrini, 2001; Albuquerque and Hopenhayn, 2004; Clementi
and Hopenhayn, 2006; Haltiwanger et al., 2013), firm age does not fully explain our results. Smaller,
issuing firms grow faster than larger, issuing ones across the different age groups.
Fourth, the FSD of issuers and non-issuers behave very differently. Because smaller, issuing
firms grow faster than larger, issuing ones, their FSD tightens. But, among non-issuing firms, larger
firms grow faster than smaller ones; so they experience a widening of their FSD.
Fifth, the statistics on the median country mask differences across countries. In developed
countries with market-based financial systems (measured using the ratio of total banking claims on
the private sector to equity market capitalization), firms that issue equity are not necessarily larger
than non-issuing firms. Smaller firms issue equity as well. Moreover, the extra growth of issuing
2

firms relative to non-issuing ones is larger than in developed countries with bank-based financial
systems. In emerging economies, larger equity issuing firms grow faster than smaller equity issuing
ones, contrary to the patterns observed in developed countries.
These results contribute to several lines of research. First, corporate finance theory provides
predictions on which firms issue securities in general and equity and debt in particular (Harris and
Raviv, 1991; Myers, 2003). For example, Dang et al. (2014) argue that firms will use banks less and
securities markets more when there are smaller information asymmetries between firms and
potential investors. Focusing on debt versus equity, Jensen and Meckling (1976), Myers (1984),
Myers and Majluf (1984), and Jensen (1986) indicate that more opaque firms will be more
constrained in issuing equity than debt due to the comparatively intensive information asymmetries
and transactions costs associated with equity issuances. The pecking order view of corporate finance
suggests that more opaque firms will have a greater tendency to tap bond markets before issuing
equity (Myers and Majluf, 1984; Fama and French, 2002; Frank and Goyal, 2003, 2008). Researchers
often use firm size to proxy for transparency as larger firms tend to be older and more thoroughly
researched than smaller firms.
Our finding that larger firms are more likely to issue securities than smaller firms is
consistent with the view that firm transparency is positively related to the issuance of securities.
However, we also find that, among listed firms, bond issuers tend to be larger than equity issuers. To
the extent that firm size is a proxy for transparency, this finding conflicts with the view that opaque
listed firms tap bond markets before raising additional funds through equity issuances.
Second, corporate finance theory also provides differing views on why firms issue securities.
The textbook explanation is that firms issue securities to fund positive net present value projects. A
second, not necessarily contradictory, view is that firms issue securities to change their capital
structure. Rather than issuing securities primarily to fund new projects, corporations might do so to
3

alter debt-equity ratios, replace expensive financing with cheaper funding, reduce free cash flows,
minimize taxes, or change the duration of debt, with corresponding effects on corporate
governance, profits, and risk exposure (Jensen, 1986; Hart, 1995; Graham and Harvey, 2001; Brealey
et al., 2011; Shin and Zhao, 2013; Shin, 2014). Because changes in capital structure might be related
to corporate investment decisions, it is difficult to distinguish between these two motives for issuing
securities.
Our results suggest that the capital structure is not the only factor that changes when firms
issue securities. In fact, debt and equity issuances are associated with an immediate and enduring
boost in firm size. Issuers grow comparatively rapidly in the year they issue securities and this
growth does not simply represent an increase in corporate assets. Sales and the number of
employees grow, too. Therefore, the issuance of securities is related to changes in the real side of
firms.
Third, as reviewed by Levine (2005), researchers debate whether and how capital markets
influence economic growth. Although the size of capital markets and the liquidity of secondary stock
markets are positively associated with aggregate growth (Levine and Zervos, 1996, 1998; DemirgucKunt and Maksimovic, 1998; Henry, 2000; Beck and Levine, 2004; Bekaert et al., 2005), researchers
have not determined whether the activity in primary markets is associated with growth across a
broad cross-section of countries. Namely, is there a direct connection between a firm issuing
securities and the growth of its assets, sales, and employment?1 Some research suggests that capital
markets foster economic growth by lowering the cost of diversifying and pooling risks (Levine,
1992; Obstfeld, 1994; Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 1997). Other research stresses that large, liquid
markets increase the expected benefits from researching firms, with positive repercussions on the
While in this paper we examine the growth of firm assets, sales, and employment around security issuances, the
literature has studied why firms issue securities and cross-list and the evolution of capital structure and corporate
valuation around these events (Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1998; Henderson et al., 2006; Karolyi, 2006; Claessens
and Schmukler, 2007; Gozzi et al., 2008, 2010).

creation and dissemination of information (Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980; Holmström and Tirole,
1993). From these perspectives, well-functioning capital markets help listed firms through different
channels, not necessarily through new security issuances.
Our findings indicate that when firms choose to issue securities they experience a material
boost in assets, sales, and employment relative to listed firms that do not issue securities and relative
to their own performance before issuing. This suggests that there is a direct, positive connection
between capital raising activity and growth at the firm level. Although issuance is not random and
firms might issue when they have growth opportunities, these findings indicate that firms grow
faster when they issue, and that it is not just the availability of well-functioning securities markets
that fosters the growth of listed firms.
Fourth, a large and rapidly growing literature examines the evolution of the FSD to
understand firm dynamics under the presence of financial (and other) frictions. Whereas early papers
found support for the Gibrat’s law, stating that firm growth is independent of firm size (Simon and
Bonnini, 1958; Mansfield, 1962; Ijiri and Simon, 1964), later work found that smaller firms grow
faster than larger ones (Evans, 1987). More recently, a growing literature finds for individual
countries that (1) smaller and younger firms are more financially constrained, (2) a relaxation of
financial constraints has a larger impact on those firms, and (3) the development of financial systems
is related to the extent of financial constraints, the evolution of the FSD, and firm dynamics (Cabral
and Mata, 2003; Angelini and Generale, 2008; Arellano et al., 2012; Buera et al., 2014; Midrigan and
Xu, 2014).
Our findings relate to this literature. We examine a much wider array of countries than
previous studies and focus only on listed firms, which tend to be less financially constrained than
non-listed firms and are a more homogeneous group than a sample of all firms. Nevertheless, we
find notable heterogeneity even among listed firms. Whereas previous studies find that smaller firms
5

grow faster than larger ones, we find that this depends on whether the firms are issuers or nonissuers. Among issuers, smaller firms grow faster, so that their FSD tends to tighten. But among
non-issuers, larger firms grow faster than smaller firms, so that their FSD tends to become wider.
Our results also emphasize potential connections between financial constraints and the evolution of
the FSD. Our finding that small issuing firms grow faster in terms of assets, sales, and employment
than larger ones is consistent with the view that financial constraints are especially binding on
smaller firms. Moreover, to the extent that issuing securities signals that a firm experiences a
relaxation in financial constraints, then our finding that issuing firms enjoy a boost in growth when
issuing securities is consistent with the view that financial constraints materially constrain the growth
of firms. Furthermore, our finding that the additional growth of issuing firms (vis-à-vis non-issuing
ones) is greater in countries with relatively well-developed capital markets than in other economies is
consistent with the view that market-based financial systems ease constraints on security issuances,
with positive ramifications on the ability of firms to realize their growth opportunities.
Fifth, a large literature emphasizes that capital market development can expand access to
finance, loosen financing constraints, and disproportionately boost the growth of small, capable
firms (Demirguc-Kunt and Levine, 2001; Myers, 2003; Stein, 2003; Ayyagari et al., 2013). The
findings in this paper provide qualified support for this view. For most countries, only a few large
firms issue securities and then grow rapidly. Thus, capital market development around the world has
not, in general, involved smaller firms issuing securities to fuel growth. The qualification is that this
finding depends on where firms are located. In developed countries with market-based financial
systems, it is not just larger listed firms that raise capital through equity offerings. This suggests that,
as securities markets across countries develop, the extensive margin among listed firms might
expand, so that smaller firms could participate more in these markets.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3
6

briefly describes the evolution of capital market development and how many firms use and capture
the capital market activity. Section 4 presents the results on which firms use these markets. Section 5
shows the results on firm performance and the evolution of the FSD. Section 6 explores the
heterogeneity in firm behavior according to the type of securities issued, market of issuance, and
firms’ home market. Section 7 studies the role of firm age. Section 8 concludes.

2. Data
To assess which firms issue securities, the comparative performance of issuing and non-issuing
firms, and the evolution of the size distribution of firms as they issue securities, we assemble a
comprehensive dataset covering firm bond and equity issuances in capital markets around the world
as well as balance sheet information on publicly listed firms. The data on firm capital raising activity
cover the period 1991-2011 and come from the Thomson Reuters Security Data Corporation (SDC)
Platinum database, which provides transaction-level information on new issuances of common and
preferred equity and publicly and privately placed bonds with an original maturity of more than one
year.2 Given that the SDC Platinum database does not collect data on debt issuances with maturities
shorter than one year, the dataset does not cover commercial paper. For offerings in more than one
market, we consider each market a separate issuance. The dataset includes 532,423 security
issuances: 138,968 equity issuances and 393,455 bond issuances. Security issuances are classified as
domestic or international based on the location of the main exchange where the issuances take place
and compared with the issuing firm’s nationality. The dataset includes 411,180 issuances in domestic
markets and 116,811 issuances in foreign markets (4,432 issuances are not possible to be classified
and have been assigned missing values).

2 SDC

Platinum collects data on security issuance mostly from filings with local regulatory agencies and stock exchanges.
These data are augmented with data from other sources such as offering circulars, prospectuses, surveys of investment
banks, brokers, and other financial advisors, news sources, trade publications, and wires.

7

To examine the comparative characteristic and performance of issuing and non-issuing
firms, we match the dataset on security issuances from SDC Platinum with 2003-2011 firm-level
balance sheet information from the Orbis (Bureau van Dijk) database. The latter covers publicly
listed companies from 155 economies, providing a rather homogeneous sample of firms. By
omitting unlisted firms, the sample excludes firms that are (a) relatively small and sometimes
informal, (b) likely to have different accounting standards, and (c) less likely to issue in capital
markets. Moreover, because of a lack of coverage of capital raising activity in domestic bond
markets, Canada and the Republic of Korea are not included in the final sample. Firms from
countries with less than 10 issuing firms between 2003 and 2011 are excluded from the final sample
and so are the firms from offshore financial centers. The final matched dataset covers 45,527 firms
from 51 countries. Overall, our matched dataset covers at least 85% of the listed firms in each
country and 479,501 security issuances.3,4
We classify firms as issuers or non-issuers based on whether they issued equity or bonds at
any point during our sample period. Because firm-level balance sheet information is only available
for the period from 2003 to 2011, we classify a firm as an issuer if it had at least one equity or bond
issuance during that period. We further classify whether firms are equity or bond issuers depending
on whether firms issued any equity or bonds, respectively. If a firm raised capital through equity and
bonds between 2003 and 2011, it is classified both as an equity and as a bond issuer. We also classify
firms as domestic or foreign equity issuers and as domestic or foreign bond issuers, depending on
whether they issued equity or bonds in domestic or foreign markets. Foreign issuers are the firms
that had at least one capital raising issuance in foreign markets between 2003 and 2011. Domestic

Appendix Table 1 reports the list of countries and the number of non-issuing and issuing firms from each country
covered in the final matched dataset.

several firms that issue securities, especially bonds, do not have balance sheet data in Orbis.

issuers comprise firms that issued only in domestic markets.5 Hence, firms that raised capital in both
domestic and foreign markets over the sample period are classified as foreign issuers. The sample of
non-issuing firms is held fixed throughout the paper. Non-issuing firms are those that did not have
any capital raising activity between 2003 and 2011. In the SDC-Orbis data 18,342 firms are issuers
(16,198 firms are equity issuers and 5,134 are bond issuers) and 27,185 are non-issuing firms.
We classify the countries in the sample into developed and emerging economies following
the World Bank classification of countries. In particular, developed countries are those with a gross
national income (GNI) per capita in 2009 above $12,195 (U.S. dollars). All other countries are
classified as emerging economies. The developed countries are further classified according to their
financial structure—whether they have bank- or market-based financial systems. For emerging
economies, we do not have enough variation to split this group by bank- and market-based financial
systems. However, in additional exercises we classified all countries as bank- or market-based.
Following Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2001) we construct a measure of financial structure based on
relative size. The developed countries with an average ratio of total banking claims on the private
sector to equity market capitalization above the sample median are classified as bank-based
economies, while all the other developed economies are classified as market-based ones.6 The final
matched dataset comprises firms from 20 emerging countries and 31 developed countries, of which
16 have bank-based financial systems. Appendix Table 1 reports the list of countries in each of these
categories.
Our analyses focus on firm size and growth, measured by the level and growth rate of total
For robustness, in unreported results, we considered overlapping groups of domestic and foreign issuers. That is,
foreign issuers are the firms that had at least one capital raising issuance in foreign markets between 2003 and 2011,
whereas domestic issuers comprise firms that had at least one capital raising issuance in domestic markets over the same
period. The results are qualitatively similar to the ones reported in the paper.
6 To classify countries, we use data between 2000 and 2003, but these measures tend to be fairly stable over time.
Moreover, several papers show that measures of financial structure based on size are very similar to measures based on
activity, such as the ratio of bank credit to value traded in equity markets. Indeed, Beck and Levine (2002) show that the
correlations between these two measures are over 0.65 and significant at the 1% level. Also see Levine (2002),
Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (2002), Ergungor (2004), and Demirguc-Kunt et al. (2013).

assets (or assets), sales, and the number of employees. Firm assets and sales are measured in
constant 2011 U.S. dollars, using the consumer price index (CPI) to discount nominal values. The
analysis also examines firm age (measured in 2011), firm profitability, and other financial indicators
such as return on assets (ROA), leverage (including bank and other types of financing), and the
maturity profile of liabilities.
We also match the SDC-Orbis dataset with the SDC Platinum database on mergers and
acquisitions (M&A) to assess whether firms with M&A activity around their capital raisings display a
similar performance than other firms raising capital. This helps us analyze whether the patterns we
uncover are driven by M&A activity and whether the expansion of firms comes from their own
internal growth. To do so, we identify whether issuing firms engage in some M&A activity as the
acquirer firm in the year of the capital raising or the following year. Of the 18,342 issuing firms in
the sample, 8,919 firms conducted an M&A transaction (about 50% of the issuing firms). The results
using the M&A data are mentioned in the text but not reported to save space.
Although in this paper we use the firm-level data for 2003-2011 due to the wide coverage of
firms by SDC Platinum, we also match the data on security issuances from SDC Platinum with
balance sheet information from the Thomson Reuters Worldscope database. One advantage of the
matched SDC-Worldscope dataset is that it covers a longer time span, including the 1990s.
However, due to the Worldscope coverage, the matched Worldscope dataset contains a smaller set
of firms (38,622 firms) than the matched Orbis dataset and does not include the United States. A
comparison of the sample of firms in Orbis and Worldscope suggests that the Worldscope sample is
biased toward larger firms. As for the results using the M&A data, the results using the Worldscope
data are mentioned in the text but not reported.

3. Capital Market Growth: The Intensive and Extensive Margins
Capital markets have grown markedly since the early 1990s in both developed and emerging
economies (Figure 1). The median developed country’s equity market expanded from an average of
35% of GDP over the period 1991-1995 to an average of 84% over 2006-2011. Even more
pronounced growth patterns are observed in emerging countries, where markets grew from 17% to
59% of GDP over the same period in the median country. Corporate bond markets also grew,
especially in emerging economies where they increased more than 6-fold, albeit from a low base. In
the median developed country, corporate bond markets expanded from an average of 27% of GDP
in 1991-1995 to 41% in 2006-2011. As a comparison, private credit by deposit money banks
increased from 81% to 117% (27% to 36%) of GDP in the median developed (emerging) country
during the same period.
The expansion in primary capital market activity has also been sizeable (Figure 2, Panel A).
For the median country in our sample, the per annum amount of new equity issuances as a
proportion of GDP almost doubled, from about 0.7% during 1991-1995 to 1.3 % during 2006-2011.
There has also been pronounced growth in the issuance of corporate bonds, especially in the late
2000s. Bond issuances rose from 1.8% of GDP per annum for the median country in the early
1990s to 3.1% in second half of the 2000s. Thus, whether considering market size or primary
activity, the median country has experienced a noticeable expansion of equity and bond markets.
Capital market growth has been associated mainly with a growth in the intensive margin: a
small number of firms have materially increased their use of capital markets since the 1990s. And
there has not been much of an increase in the extensive margin, in the number of firms issuing
securities. For the median country, the average number of firms issuing equity per year increased
from 18 in the early 1990s to 23 in the late 2000s (Figure 2, Panel B). In the case of bonds, the
average number of firms per annum issuing them in the median country was 27 in the early 1990s
11

and 22 in the late 2000s.7
Not only do few firms raise funds in capital markets, an even smaller number of firms raise
the bulk of the financing and account for the rapid growth of security issuances. For example, the
amount raised in equity markets per year by the top-5 issuers in the median country remained at
about 80% of the total amount raised over the entire period 1991-2011 (Figure 2, Panel C). The top5 bond issuers in the median country captured close to 70% of the total amount raised, with the top20 issuers capturing over 90%.
Although there is cross-country heterogeneity, the patterns described above exist for most
economies. Even for the most developed markets, a small proportion of listed firms raise capital
through equity or bond issuances (Appendix Figure 1). For example, in France, Germany, the
United Kingdom, and the United States less than half of the firms in our sample conducted an
equity offering or sold a bond over the period 2003-11. There is also remarkable skewness across
virtually all countries. Only in Australia, China, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, the United Kingdom, and
the United States is the amount raised by the top-5 equity issuers less than 50% of the total amount
raised in equity markets. Even in other G7 economies like Germany, France, and Italy, the top-5
equity issuers captured 61%, 65%, and 71% of the total amount raised in our sample period,
respectively. The concentration of funds raised by a few large firms in corporate bond markets is
also pronounced across most countries.
This concentration in capital market activity does not simply reflect concentration in
economic activity.8 Within our sample of listed firms, economic activity is indeed concentrated: the
top-5 firms in sales capture about 45% of the total sales (Figure 3, Panel A). However, capital
If we use a 5-year window, instead of examining issuances per year, the total number of firms issuing equity in the
median country increased from 72 in 1991-1995 to 103 in 2006-2011. In the case of bonds, it declined from 87 to 76
firms over the same period.
8 Although Gabaix (2011), di Giovanni and Levchenko (2012), Eaton et al. (2012), and Freund and Pierola (2012) find
that the top firms in a country play a crucial role in aggregate outcomes, we find that the concentration in capital market
financing does not simply involve the same firms that are concentrated in terms of economic activity.

market activity is concentrated in a different set of firms: the top-5 firms in terms of sales actually
capture less than 15% of the total amount raised in capital markets (Figure 3, Panel B). Consistent
with this, the top-5 issuing firms capture 15% or less than the total sales by the firms in our sample
(Figure 3, Panel C). In other words, although capital markets seem to be a source of financing for
relatively few firms, the top issuing firms are not necessarily the top firms in terms of sales.

4. Which Firms Use Capital Markets?
To assess which firms access capital markets, we compare the characteristics of non-issuing firms,
issuing firms, and the different types of issuing firms. We compare (a) firm size (measured by assets
and sales in 2011 U.S. dollars and the number of employees), (b) firm growth (measured by the
growth rate of assets, sales, and employees), (c) firm leverage, (d) the liability structure of firm debt
(measured by the ratio of long-term debt to total firm liabilities), (e) firm profitability (measured by
retained earnings over assets and return on assets, or ROA), and (d) firm age. Besides differentiating
by whether firms issue equity or debt, we also examine whether firms issue equity domestically,
equity in foreign markets, bonds domestically, or bonds in foreign markets. In comparing firm traits
across non-issuing and issuing firms, we use the median across countries of the median firm in any
given country, after obtaining the average over time for each firm. Because for the rest of the paper
we use the matched dataset on capital raisings and balance sheet information, the sample is restricted
to 2003-2011.
Issuing firms are different from non-issuing firms along many dimensions. Issuers are
typically much larger than publicly listed firms that do not issue stocks or bonds (Table 1). The
median issuer in the median country (of either equity or bonds) has assets of $317 million, while
non-issuers have $100 million in assets. There are also large size differences across firms that issue
equity and bonds and across those that issue securities in domestic and foreign capital markets. The

median bond issuer has assets of $3.7 billion, while the median equity issuer has assets of $256
million, which is more than a 14-fold difference. Moreover, the median firm that issues securities
abroad is much larger than the median firm that sells stocks or bonds in domestic markets. The
median bond issuer in domestic markets has assets of $1.5 billion, whereas the median bond issuer
in foreign markets has assets of $4.9 billion. The results are qualitatively similar when focusing on
either sales or the number of employees rather than assets.9
Issuing firms also tend to grow much faster than non-issuing firms (Table 1). While the
assets of non-issuing firms grew at a 4.3% a year during the sample period, the assets of equity and
bond issuers grew at 10.5% and 9.4% a year, respectively. As a comparison, for the median country
(Brazil and Bulgaria), the average GDP growth during this period was 3.9%. Furthermore, firms that
issue equity abroad tend to have faster growth rates than those that issue equity in domestic markets
only. The differences in growth rates are also sizeable if we analyze sales and the number of
employees. For example, growth in the number of employees for issuers averaged 4.4% a year, but
only 0.9% for non-issuers between 2003 and 2011.
Do the differences between issuing and non-issuing firms exist before an issuance takes
place? Or do they primarily emerge as firms issue equity or bonds? To address this, we estimate
Probit models that measure the probability of issuing equity or bonds during the 2005-11 period
based on firm-level attributes in 2004 (firms with capital raising activity only in 2003 and/or 2004
are excluded from these regressions).10 In each regression, we use only one explanatory variable for

The median issuing firm tends to be much larger than the median non-issuing firm in virtually all countries. For
example, the assets of the median equity-issuing firm are larger than the assets of the median non-issuing firm in all
countries except in a handful of cases (Australia, France, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore,
Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom). For about half of the countries, the median equity issuing firm is at least
2.5 times larger than the median non-issuing firm. In the case of bonds, in all but two countries (Australia and
Luxembourg) the median bond issuer is at least five times as large as the median non-issuer.
10 In unreported results, we estimated Cox proportional hazard models to capture the probability of raising capital
through equity or bonds. The Cox model estimates the determinants of the probability of issuing equity and bonds by
employing all available information up to the year before an issuance takes place. The estimates obtained are consistent
with the ones presented using Probit models.

size and one for growth due to multi-collinearity. All the regressions include country dummies to
control for country-specific effects.11
Many differences between issuers and non-issuers exist before firms issue securities. The
results show that larger firms and those with higher growth rates are more likely to raise capital in
equity or bond markets (Table 2). Firms with longer-term debt are also more likely to issue.
Although issuing firms are ex ante bigger and faster growing, they tend to be less profitable. 12 With
respect to economic significance, firm size is generally the most important predictor of future capital
raising activity. For example, a one standard deviation increase in the log of assets for the average
firm raises the likelihood of issuing in capital markets by around 18 percentage points.13 A one
standard deviation increase in asset growth is associated with an increase of about 6 percentage
points in the probability of issuing a stock or bond. The results using sales or the number of
employees as a proxy for size are quantitatively and qualitatively similar. Moreover, a one standard
deviation increase in ROA lowers the probability of new capital market activity by about 6
percentage points.
We also estimate the Probit models for the probability of issuing only equity and the
probability of issuing only bonds in both domestic and foreign markets. The results are qualitatively
similar to the ones obtained by estimating the probability of raising capital in general (Table 2, right
panels). The estimations show that firm size, firm growth, and the longer liability maturity structure
are positively and statistically related to the use of capital market financing, while firm profitability is

In unreported results, we used industry dummies to control for sector-specific effects, following the major industry
divisions of the SIC classification at the two-digit level (agriculture, forestry, and fishing; construction; finance,
insurance, and real estate; manufacturing; mining; public administration; retail trade; services; transportation,
communications, and utilities; and wholesale trade). The results are similar to the ones reported here.
12 In unreported results, we explored whether changes in profitability occur around the capital raising activity. We find
that profitability does not increase in the year following an issuance.
13 The estimates reported in Table 2 show the marginal effects on the probability of issuance of a unit change in each
explanatory variable. These variables, however, are in different units, making these effects not directly comparable across
variables. Thus, in the text, we discuss the marginal effects associated with a one standard deviation change in the
explanatory variables.
11

15

negatively associated with issuance activity. The main difference between firms issuing equity and
bonds is that the marginal effect of size on the probability of capital raising activity is much higher
for bond issuers than for equity issuers. For example, a one standard deviation increase in the log of
assets raises the likelihood of an issuance by about 3 percentage points for equity issuances and by
about 30 percentage points for bond issuances.
In sum, as the capitalization of equity and bond markets and the aggregate capital raising
activity increased markedly since the 1990s, we find that throughout our sample (i) only a few firms
issued securities in the median country, and indeed in the vast majority of countries, (ii) of the few
firms that issued securities, only a handful of those accounted for the bulk of the funds raised by
listed firms in capital markets, and (iii) the ones that did issue securities in domestic and foreign
markets tended to be large and fast growing.

5. How Do Assets, Sales, and Employment Evolve for Issuing and Non-issuing Firms?
This section assesses (1) whether issuers grow faster than non-issuers, (2) whether a bump in growth
materializes immediately after a firm issues securities, and (3) how the growth gap between issuers
and non-issuers differs across the full distribution of firm size.
We begin by estimating four probability density functions that capture the FSD: two for
2003 (one for issuers of either equity or bonds and one for non-issuers) and two analogous ones for
2010. Due to data availability on firm-level balance sheets in Orbis, we focus the rest of the paper on
the 2003-2010 sample. That is, issuing firms that raised capital through equity or bonds only in 2011
are excluded from the analysis henceforth. However, the results are qualitatively similar if we use the
full sample available for 2003-2011.
As illustrated in Figure 4, three key findings emerge about the FSD when using assets, sales,
or the number of employees to measure firm size. First, the distribution of issuers in 2003 is to the
16

right of that of non-issuers, indicating that issuing firms are typically larger ex ante than non-issuing
firms. These patterns are consistent with the evidence presented in the previous section that larger
firms are more likely to issue equity and debt securities. Second, the FSD for both issuing and nonissuing firms shifted to the right from 2003 to 2010, indicating that publicly listed firms typically
grew over this period. Third, the distribution of issuing firms shifted farther to the right than that of
non-issuers, implying that issuing firms grew more than non-issuing ones while they issued
securities. The differences in the FSD are statistically significant based on unreported KolmogorovSmirnov statistics.
To further assess whether issuing firms are typically larger and faster growing than nonissuing ones across the distribution of firm sizes, we estimate quantile regressions using differencesin-differences specifications. More specifically, we use information on firm size for 2003 and 2010
for all firms in the sample, and estimate quantile regressions on a constant, a dummy for issuer
firms, a 2010 dummy variable that takes the value of one for observations in 2010, and a term
interacting these two dummy variables. We estimate these regressions using the log of assets, sales,
or the number of employees as dependent variables.
The estimated coefficients from the quantile regressions in Table 3 are reported in
exponential form and need to be interpreted as follows. For a given quantile, the constant term
measures the size in 2003 of non-issuing firms. The coefficient on the dummy for whether it is an
issuing firm measures the size of issuers relative to the size of non-issuers in 2003. The coefficient
on the 2010 dummy measures the growth rate of non-issuing firms between 2003 and 2010.14 The
coefficient on the interaction term (the interaction between the dummy for an issuing firm and the
dummy for observations in 2010) measures the growth of issuers relative to non-issuers; therefore, it

The level of the
quantile of size for non-issuing firms in 2010 can be obtained by multiplying the constant and the
reported coefficient on the 2010 dummy variable. Similar calculations make it possible to recover the levels of the
quantiles for the other distributions.
14

17

captures whether the distribution of issuers shifts more to the right than that of non-issuers between
2003 and 2010. Thus, the coefficient on this interaction term is of special interest.
Consistent with the kernel density estimates, the results of the quantile regressions show that
issuing firms are ex ante larger than non-issuing firms. Importantly, not only are the top firms in the
distribution of issuers larger than the top firms in the distribution of non-issuers, but these
differences also exist at every decile of the distributions, including the bottom ones. That is, the
entire distribution of issuing firms lies to the right of that of non-issuing firms. The results are
statistically significant for all estimates, except for the bottom deciles of the distribution of the
number of employees. These differences are also economically significant. For example, issuing
firms at the 1st decile are larger than non-issuing firms at the same decile of the distribution by 63%
in assets, 24% in sales, and 7% in the number of employees.
Issuing firms not only start larger than non-issuing firms, but they also grow much faster
than non-issuing firms at all deciles of the distribution. In other words, there is actually ex post
divergence in firm size between issuers and non-issuers. The coefficients on the interacted term are
larger than one and statistically significant for every estimated decile, with the exception of the top
decile of the FSD in all three specifications (assets, sales, and the number of employees), thus
providing evidence that issuing firms grew faster than non-issuing firms over the same period. There
is in fact a sizeable additional shift in the distribution of issuing firms vis-à-vis that of non-issuing
firms between 2003 and 2010, after taking into account the initial differences in size between issuers
and non-issuers. For example, as shown by the estimated interacted term, the ratio of firm size
between issuers and non-issuers at the bottom 1st decile of the distribution of assets increased 115%
over this period; issuing firms were 63% larger than non-issuing firms in 2003 and became 250%
larger by 2010. The implied differential in annualized growth rates is substantial. Non-issuing firms
at the 1st decile of the distribution of assets grew 1.6% per year between 2003 and 2010, whereas
18

issuing firms at the same decile of the distribution grew 13.3% per year over the same period.
Qualitatively similar differences are estimated for sales and the number of employees.
Figure 5 plots the growth rate of issuers and non-issuers implied by the regressions for the
different deciles of the distribution of assets, sales, and the number of employees. Table 4 shows the
inter-quantile tests of equality of coefficients and compares the 5th decile with the 1st decile, the 6th
with the 2nd, and so forth. These tests not only provide quantitative evidence on the statistical
differences across deciles, but also capture the monotonicity of these effects.
For non-issuing firms, there is divergence in the distribution of firm size. The estimated
coefficients on the 2010 dummy variable in Table 3 are larger for higher deciles than for the lower
ones. While one observes growth for all deciles of non-issuing firms, we find faster growth among
the larger non-issuing firms. For example, firms at the 1st decile of the distribution of assets grew
1.6% per year between 2003 and 2010, whereas firms at the 9th decile of the distribution grew 6.4%
per year. The increase in growth rates is more subdued for the distributions based on sales and the
number of employees.
In contrast, there is convergence in the distribution of firm size among issuing firms. That is,
smaller firms typically grow faster than larger firms. Moreover, the growth rates of issuing firms
actually decrease monotonically with firm size as indicated by the negative inter-decile tests in Table
4. The decline in growth rates is particularly accentuated in the top half of the FSD, with tests
between the 9th and the 5th deciles statistically significant for all three distributions. These differences
in growth rates are in fact quantitatively large. For instance, issuing firms at the 9th decile typically
grew around 52% less than issuing firms at the 5th decile of the distribution of assets between 2003
and 2010.
These growth patterns imply that the growth differential between issuing and non-issuing
firms is much greater for smaller firms than for larger firms (Figure 5). Namely, issuing firms grow
19

faster than non-issuing firms at each decile of the distribution of firm size, but the growth gap
between small issuing and non-issuing firms is much larger than the growth gap between large
issuing and non-issuing firms. The negative and statistically significant inter-decile tests (Table 4)
show that this growth differential for issuers relative to non-issuers declines monotonically with firm
size. In fact, as indicated by the interacted coefficients (Table 3), at the 9 th decile the differences in
growth rates between issuing and non-issuing firms are no longer statistically significant.
The previous estimations of the FSD do not distinguish firms by country (they pool all the
observations) because for most countries very few firms issue securities and the FSD cannot be
estimated at the country level. But to assess whether the patterns we find are driven by countryspecific effects (in particular, by countries growing at different rates), we estimate cross-sectional
regressions of total firm growth between 2003 and 2010 on country fixed effects and a dummy
variable that captures whether the firm is an issuer (Table 5). Analogous to the estimations in Table
3, we split firms into deciles according to their size in 2003 and estimate standard linear regressions
using observations within each decile. The results are consistent with the findings in Table 3. Issuing
firms grew faster between 2003 and 2010 than non-issuing firms. Moreover, the estimated
coefficients for the issuing dummy are typically larger at the lower deciles than at the upper deciles,
indicating convergence in size within issuing firms over time.
We next assess whether growth rises at the time of issuance. Because the estimations in
Tables 3 and 5 show results for the entire 2003-2010 period, they do not show what happens in the
year when firms actually issue. To do so, we first conduct an event study, computing the growth rate
of issuers versus non-issuers in each year (+/- 3 years) around the time of issuance, grouping firms
by their year of first issuance. The results show that while issuers grow faster than non-issuers before
and after they issue, the growth rate at the time of issuance increases significantly (Figure 6).
We then pool the groups of firms issuing in different years and estimate panel regressions.
20

On average, the assets of issuing firms continuously rise over the 7-year window around a capital
raising issue (Table 6, Panel A). Moreover, the average asset growth of issuers is higher than that of
non-issuers, particularly so during the year of issuance: 8.6 percentage points one year before issuing,
22.7 percentage points the year of issuance, and 8.2 percentage points the year after issuance (Table
6, Panel B). This differential growth becomes smaller two and three years before and after issuing.
Similar patterns are obtained when using sales and the number of employees.
These estimates provide additional evidence on two key features of security issuances. First,
it is not just that fast growing firms are more likely to issue securities. Rather, firm assets, sales, and
employment tend to rise substantially in the year they issue securities. Second, firms do not issue
securities simply to adjust their capital structure. Instead, the estimates in levels and growth rates
show that assets, sales, and employment rise as firms issue securities.
We conducted a number of additional robustness tests. First, the results presented in this
paper are quantitatively and qualitatively robust to the exclusion of financial and utility firms.
Moreover, the results hold when using only financial and utility firms, suggesting that they do not
behave differently than firms in other industries. Second, the results hold when controlling for M&A
activity. In particular, the results are robust to the exclusion of firms that engage (as acquirer) in an
M&A activity in the year of the capital raising or in the following year. Third, Chinese and Indian
firms represent a relatively large fraction of the sample (about 16%) and the patterns documented in
this paper are similar in these two countries (Didier and Schmukler, 2013). However, the results are
qualitatively similar to the ones reported here when excluding China and India, which indicates that
these countries are not driving the results. Fourth, the results are robust when considering only the
second half of the sample, namely 2006-2010. Fifth, the results are also qualitatively similar to the
ones reported here when using the Worldscope balance sheet database that covers a longer time
span (1995-2011). In particular, we estimated the regressions over three different sample periods
21

(1995-2011, 1995-2002, and 2003-2011) to verify the robustness of our findings to these different
partitions. Sixth, although the analysis considers both IPO (initial public offerings) and non-IPO
capital raising activity, the results are robust to the exclusion of IPO capital raising activity. Seventh,
the reported estimates from quantile regressions use bootstrapped standard errors with 400
replications clustered at the firm level. The results are robust to the alternative use of more
replications, non-clustered standard errors, and other levels of clustering (country, sector, and
country-sector level).
Overall, firms that use capital market financing are larger to begin with, grow faster,
especially in the year of issuance, and become larger than non-issuing firms. There is not only
divergence in size between issuing and non-issuing, but also within non-issuing firms, as the growth
rates of non-issuing firms increase with firm size. However, within issuing firms the growth rates
decrease monotonically with firm size, indicating convergence in size among them. Furthermore, the
growth differential between issuing and non-issuing firms is significantly larger for smaller firms.

6. Heterogeneity in Firm Behavior
To provide additional information on the characteristics and performance of issuing firms, we split
these firms by (1) type of securities issued (equity versus bonds), (2) issuing market (domestic versus
foreign), and (3) the level of financial development of the firms’ home market (bank-based
developed countries, market-based developed countries, and emerging countries). In additional tests,
we compared developed versus emerging countries and bank-based versus market-based countries
(pooling developed and emerging countries) and obtained qualitatively similar conclusions. We do
not report those results to reduce the number of tables. For the same reason we provide results
based only on assets, but the findings are robust to using sales or the number of employees.
For the split between equity and bond financing, we define equity issuers as those firms that
22

raised capital through equity securities between 2003 and 2010. The issuing firms that raised capital
through just bonds (not equity) between 2003 and 2010 are excluded from this sample. We use an
analogous definition for bond issuers. As in the previous section, the issuing firms with capital
raising activity only in 2011 are also excluded from the sample. The control group of non-issuing
firms is the same in both cases and it is the same as in the previous section, namely, the firms that
did not issue either equity or bonds over the sample period.
The results show that bond issuers are much larger than equity issuers at all deciles of the
FSD (Table 7, Panels A and B). For example, equity issuers at the 1st decile of the distribution were
17% larger than non-issuers in 2003, whereas bond issuers were 1,391% larger. Moreover, equityissuing firms grew relatively faster than bond issuing firms between 2003 and 2010. For example,
after taking into account the initial differences in size between issuers and non-issuers, equity issuers
at the 5th decile of the distribution grew 73% more than non-issuers, whereas bond issuers at the
same decile of the FSD had an expansion in assets of 41% more than non-issuers. These differences
are statistically significant according to unreported tests. In sum, firms that issue equity are smaller
than bond issuers and tend to experience faster growth than bond issuers.
To assess whether there are differences between domestic and foreign capital raising activity,
we define foreign issuers are the firms that had at least one capital raising issue in foreign markets
between 2003 and 2010. Domestic issuers comprise firms that issued only in domestic markets. The
control group consists of those firms that did not issue equity or bonds in domestic or foreign
markets over the sample period. The results reported here are quantitatively and qualitatively robust
to separately analyzing the patterns for domestic equity issuers, foreign equity issuers, domestic bond
issuers, and foreign bond issuers.
The core findings that issuers are larger and grow faster than non-issuers hold across
markets (Table 7, Panels C and D). Firms that use domestic capital market financing, be it equity or
23

bond financing, start out larger and grow faster than non-issuing firms. For instance, the median
firm issuing domestically is twice as large as non-issuers. In contrast, the median firm issuing abroad
is 26 times as large. Despite being considerably larger, firms issuing in foreign markets also typically
grow faster than non-issuing firms. Complementing and reinforcing the previous results, the
differential growth of issuers in foreign markets relative to non-issuers also declines monotonically
with firm size. At the 9th decile, the differences in growth between both equity and bond foreign
issuers and non-issuers are typically no longer statistically significant. Small, foreign issuers grow
faster than small, domestic issuers.
Next, we examine the characteristics and performance of issuing firms by differentiating the
nature of their home securities markets. Tables 8 and 9 show quantile regressions for equity and
bond issuers for developed and emerging countries separately, the former are also split according to
whether they have bank-based or market-based financial systems.
In terms of ex ante firm size, equity issuers at the bottom half of the distribution in marketbased developed economies are significantly smaller than non-issuing firms, contrary to the trends
observed in developed bank-based economies. For example, equity-issuing firms at the 1st decile of
the distribution in developed bank-based economies are four times larger than non-issuing firms at
the same decile, while in developed market-based economies equity issuers are 52% smaller than
non-issuing firms.
There are also some differences in the growth patterns for issuing firms across countries. In
particular, the magnitude of the growth differentials between issuing and non-issuing firms in
market-based developed countries is consistently larger than in developed bank-based economies for
firms of different sizes, especially those at the bottom deciles. In emerging countries, both nonissuing firms and equity-issuing firms at the top deciles of the distribution typically grow faster than
those at the bottom deciles. These patterns imply a divergence in the FSD for both equity-issuing
24

and non-issuing firms. Furthermore, the growth differential between equity-issuing and non-issuing
firms is somewhat stable across the different deciles. In the case of bonds, the growth differential
between issuing and non-issuing firms declines with firm size.
To summarize, there is heterogeneity in firm size and performance around capital raising
activity depending on whether the securities are equity or debt, whether they are issued in domestic
or foreign markets, and whether the firm’s home market is emerging, or a more bank-based or
market-based financial system. First, firms that issue equity are smaller than bond issuers and tend to
experience faster growth than bond issuers. Second, firms that issue securities in foreign markets are
typically much larger than domestic issuers, and small, foreign issuers tend to grow faster than small,
domestic issuers. Thus, firm attributes and performance vary with the location of issuance. Third,
equity issuers at the bottom half of the distribution of firm size in market-based developed
economies are significantly smaller than non-issuing firms, which is the opposite of the patterns
observed in developed bank-based economies. Among listed firms, being large is not a defining
characteristic of equity-issuing corporations in developed economies with highly developed stock
markets. Fourth, the growth differential between issuers and non-issuers in developed market-based
economies is consistently larger than the growth gap in developed bank-based countries. And in
emerging economies larger equity issuing firms grow faster than smaller issuing firms, contrary to
the patterns observed in developed countries.

7. The Role of Firm Age
The results presented above suggest that (1) firms that issue securities tend to be larger than those
that do not, (2) issuers tend to grow faster than non-issuers, and (3) smaller issuing firms grow faster
than larger issuing firms, indicating that the FSD of issuing firms tends to converge over time. In
this section we assess whether these results simply reflect firm age, because size, age, and the degree
25

to which firms issue securities are correlated and because the median issuing firm (in the median
country) is typically younger than the median non-issuing firm (Table 1).
We explore the degree to which firm age accounts for our results in two ways. To capture its
average effect, we first estimate panel regressions of firm size in 2003 and 2010 and cross-sectional
regressions of firm growth between 2003 and 2010, both on age and issuance activity as explanatory
variables. Second, we assess whether the evolution of the FSD for issuing and non-issuing firms
differs across three firm age groups: young firms (10 years or younger in 2011), mature firms (11-30
years in 2011), and old firms (older than 30 years in 2011).15
After controlling for firm age, Table 10 indicates that our core results hold: issuing firms
start out larger and grow faster than non-issuing firms. Moreover, the results in Panels A and B for
the three proxies for firm size (assets, sales, and the number of employees) are quantitatively similar
to those reported in the last columns of Tables 3 and 5, respectively. These patterns hold on average
for both equity and bond issuers in bank-based and market-based developed countries and in
emerging economies.
Our findings regarding the FSD are qualitatively robust to the split of the sample by firm age
(Table 11). The estimated coefficients on the issuer dummy show that issuing firms are ex ante
larger than non-issuing firms for firms in all age groups. The results are statistically significant for all
estimates across all deciles. Issuing firms are not only larger to start with, but they also grow faster
than non-issuing firms across the three age groups. Also consistent with our previous findings, the
regressions show as well that while non-issuing firms of all ages expanded between 2003 and 2010,
their growth rates increased with firm size, especially for young and mature firms. In contrast, within

The results are robust to the use of other thresholds on firm age. In particular, we obtained qualitatively similar results
with the following splits: (i) based on the deciles of the firm age distribution (17 years and younger, 18-32 years, more
than 32 years in 2011); (ii) balanced split of firms into three groups (18 years and younger, 19-40 years, more than 40
years in 2011); (iii) 15 years and younger, 16-25 years, more than 25 years in 2011; (iv) 10 years and younger, 11-20 years,
more than 20 years in 2011.

issuing firms, smaller firms typically grew faster than larger firms. Hence, these results indicate that
there is some divergence in the distributions of firm size for non-issuing firms and convergence for
issuing firms. These patterns are observed for young, mature, and old firms.
In addition, the growth differential between issuing and non-issuing firms declines with firm
age. The growth differential for younger firms is larger than that for mature firms, which in turn is
larger than that for old firms. For example, the growth differential between issuing and non-issuing
firms in the 1st decile of the distribution of young firms is 36 percentage points per year between
2003 and 2010, whereas the differential in the same decile of the distribution of mature and old
firms is 10 and 4 percentage points per year, respectively. The estimations show that, controlling for
firm size, firm age and growth are negatively associated, especially for issuing firms, as younger firms
typically expanded faster than older ones between 2003 and 2010.
Overall, our results show that even after controlling for age, firms that use capital market
financing are larger to begin with and grow faster than non-issuing firms. There is not only
divergence in size between issuing and non-issuing, but also within non-issuing firms across firms in
the three age groups. Within issuing firms the growth rates decrease with firm size. Furthermore, the
growth differential between issuing and non-issuing firms is significantly larger for smaller firms
across firms of all age groups. These patterns suggest that smaller firms (after controlling for age)
and younger firms (after controlling for size) tend to grow faster after issuing securities than larger
and older firms.

8. Conclusions
During the boom in capital market activity around the world that started in the 1990s, which firms
accessed those markets and how did they perform? Using a new dataset on firm-level capital raising
activity and balance sheet information, this paper shows that relatively few firms use equity and
27

bond markets to obtain financing. The data on capital raising activity show that, for the median
country, only around 20 firms per country per year issue equity or bonds, and not many firms do so
even in developed countries. Moreover, the capital raising activity is concentrated in large, fastgrowing firms, with the top-5 issuers capturing 66%-93% of the activity. In particular, the assets of
issuing firms grew on average at 12% per year between 2003 and 2010, while those of non-issuers
grew at 4% per year. During the year of issuance, firms tend to grow at a much more rapid rate
relative to other years, and relative to non-issuing firms. As a consequence of the faster growth, the
FSD of issuing firms shifts to the right of the FSD of non-issuing firms (issuing firms become
larger). While there is divergence between issuing and non-issuing firms, there is convergence within
issuing firms because smaller firms grow faster than larger ones. Among non-issuing firms, however,
there is divergence as growth rates increase with firm size.
The findings in this paper indicate that the expansion of primary market activity is much less
widespread than some might infer from, for example, simply observing the large increases in market
capitalization around the world. Capital markets have not been a significant source of financing for
the majority of listed firms. The few, large firms that typically issue equity and bonds across most
economies tend to grow faster than non-issuers. And among issuing firms, the smaller firms are the
ones that experience the largest boost in growth.
There are some notable differences across countries depending on the degree of economic
and capital market development. Whereas in most countries issuing firms are larger than non-issuing
firms, in market-based developed economies relatively smaller firms also issue equity. Moreover, the
growth differential between issuers and non-issuers is systematically larger across all firm sizes in
market-based developed economies than in other developed countries. This is consistent with the
view that the benefits of using capital markets are greater in countries where capital markets play a
larger role and that better developed markets are associated with a wider array of firms accessing and
28

benefitting from the services provided by those markets.
The findings in this paper shed new light on debates concerning the mechanisms through
which capital markets influence firm growth. We find a strong, positive association between firms
issuing securities and firm growth. It is not just that firms grow faster in economies with better
functioning capital markets. Rather, we find that within an economy, issuers (especially smaller ones)
grow much faster than non-issuers. This evidence does not reject theories that predict that firms do
not need to sell securities to reap the benefits of better capital markets, but it does establish that
there is a strong positive relation between issuance and firm growth across a wide array of
economies. Future research needs to identify the degree to which supply side factors (such as
improvements in capital markets that relax financing constraints) drive the positive association
between capital raising and firm growth.
The findings in this paper also suggest that capital market financing is not just associated
with changes in corporate capital structure. Assets, sales, and the number of employees expand as
firms sell equity or bonds, so firms are not merely using the issuance of securities to alter debt-equity
ratios or to replace internal financing or bank lending. Moreover, the fact that firms expand not only
in terms of assets but also in terms of sales and the number of employees suggests that their growth
is not just related to a balance sheet expansion.

This figure shows the estimated kernel distributions for firm size for issuing and non-issuing firms in 2003 and 2010. Panel A uses
the log of total assets as a proxy for size, whereas panels B and C use the log of sales and the log of the number of employees,
respectively. Issuing firms are those that raised capital through equity or bonds between 2003 and 2010. Firms that issued equity or
bonds only in 2011 are excluded from this figure. Non-issuers are the other firms in our sample. Only firms with data in both 2003
and 2010 are included in this figure. The kernel type used is a Gaussian with a band-width of 1.5.

TABLE 1. FIRM CHARACTERISTICS
This table reports the median firm attributes for the 2003-2011 period. The firm attributes are calculated as the median across countries of the median firm per country. The firm-level data are averages across time per firm. The
table also reports the statistical significance of median tests for each group (in the different columns) vs. non-issuers (in the first column). Issuing firms are those with at least one capital raising issuance between 2003 and 2011.
Non-issuing firms are those that did not issue during this period. Firms classified as domestic issuers did not have any issuances abroad. Firms classified as foreign issuers could also have domestic issuances. Total assets and sales
are reported in thousands of 2011 U.S. dollars. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 2. PROBABILITY OF CAPITAL RAISING ACTIVITY
This table shows the marginal effects of Probit estimates of the probability of capital raising activity during the 2005-2011 period as a function of firm attributes in 2004. The first three columns use different measures for firm size and growth. Issuing firms that only
issued in 2003 and/or 2004 are dropped from the sample in this table. Total assets and sales are in logs of thousands of 2011 U.S. dollars. Robust standard errors are reported in brackets. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 3. QUANTILE AND MEAN REGRESSIONS
This table reports quantile and mean regressions of firm size on a constant, a dummy variable for 2010, a dummy variable for issuing firms, and an interaction term of these two dummies. The table also shows the average annual growth rates implied by these
estimates for issuing and non-issuing firms. The dependent variable pools the data on firm size at two points in time (2003 and 2010) for all firms with data in both years. Issuing firms are those that raised capital through equity or bonds between 2003 and 2010.
Firms that issued only in 2011 are excluded from this table. Panel A uses total assets as a proxy for firm size, panel B uses sales, and panel C uses the number of employees. Total assets and sales are in logs of thousands of 2011 U.S. dollars; number of employees is
in logs. All coefficients are reported in exponential form. Standard errors, shown in brackets, are bootstrapped (using 400 replications) and clustered at the firm-level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 5. 2003-2010 GROWTH AS A FUNCTION OF INITIAL SIZE
This table reports mean regressions of total firm growth between 2003 and 2010 on a dummy that equals one for companies that issued between 2003 and 2010, and zero otherwise. Firms that issued only in 2011 are excluded from this table. The regressions are
estimated separately for each decile of the distribution of firm size according to their size in 2003. The deciles are calculated by pooling all countries together. Mean regressions for the whole sample of firms are reported in the last column of each panel. Robust
standard errors are reported in brackets. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 6. EVENT STUDY OF FIRMS DYNAMICS AROUND ISSUANCE ACTIVITY
This table reports panel regressions of firm attributes on a seven-year window around the capital raising issuances that took
place between 2003 and 2011. The seven-year windows are captured by a dummy variable for the issuance year, three dummies
for the three preceding years, and three dummies for the three subsequent years. The regressions include firms with no
issuances as part of the control group. Total assets and sales are in logs of thousands of 2011 U.S. dollars; number of
employees is in logs. Standard errors, shown in brackets, are clustered at the country level. *, **, and *** denote statistical
significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 7. QUANTILE AND MEAN REGRESSIONS
This table reports quantile and mean regressions of total assets as a proxy for firm size on a constant, a dummy variable for 2010, a dummy variable for issuing firms, and an interaction
term of these two dummies. The dependent variable pools the data on total assets at two points in time (2003 and 2010) for all firms with data in both years. Issuing firms are those that
raised capital through equity (panel A) or bonds (panel B) between 2003 and 2010. Issuers are also split into domestic and foreign (panels C and D, respectively) according to whether
they issued in the country of their domicile or not. Firms that issued only in 2011 are excluded from this table. See the main text for more details. Total assets are in logs of thousands
of 2011 U.S. dollars. All coefficients are reported in exponential form. Standard errors, shown in brackets, are bootstrapped (using 400 replications) and clustered at the firm-level. *, **,
and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 8. EQUITY MARKET FINANCING: QUANTILE AND MEAN REGRESSIONS BY COUNTRY GROUP
This table reports quantile and mean regressions of total assets as a proxy for firm size on a constant, a dummy variable for 2010, a dummy variable for issuing firms, and an interaction term of these
two dummies. The dependent variable pools the data on total assets at two points in time (2003 and 2010) for all firms with data in both years. Issuing firms are those that raised capital in equity
markets between 2003 and 2010. Firms that issued only in 2011 are excluded from this table. Non-issuers include firms that did not issue (equity or bonds) in our sample. The table presents separately
the results for bank-based developed economies (panel A), market-based developed economies (panel B), and emerging economies (panel C). Total assets are in logs of thousands of 2011 U.S. dollars.
All coefficients are reported in exponential form. Standard errors, shown in brackets, are bootstrapped (using 400 replications) and clustered at the firm-level. *, **, and *** denote statistical
significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 10. MEAN REGRESSIONS CONTROLLING FOR FIRM AGE
This table reports in panel A mean regressions of firm size on a constant, a dummy variable for 2010, a dummy variable for issuing firms, an interaction term of these two dummies, and a variable for firm age. The dependent variable pools the data on firm size at two points in time (2003 and 2010) for all
firms with data in both years. All coefficients in this panel are reported in exponential form. Panel B reports regressions of firm growth between 2003 and 2010 on a dummy variable for issuing firms, a variable for firm age, and a variable for firm size in 2003. All regressions in this panel include country
fixed effects. For both panels in this table, the issuer dummy equals one for companies that issued between 2003 and 2010, and zero otherwise. Firms that issued only in 2011 are excluded from the sample. The headings in each column indicate the type of issuer and the proxy for firm size used in the
regression estimates. Total assets and sales are in logs of thousands of 2011 U.S. dollars; number of employees is in logs. Robust standard errors, shown in brackets, are clustered at firm level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

TABLE 11. QUANTILE AND MEAN REGRESSIONS CONTROLLING FOR FIRM AGE
This table reports quantile and mean regressions for total assets as a proxy for firm size on a constant, a dummy variable for 2010, a dummy variable for issuing firms, and an interaction term of these two dummies. The dependent variable pools the data on firm size at two points in time
(2003 and 2010) for all firms with data in both years. Issuing firms are those that raised capital through equity or bonds between 2003 and 2010. Firms that issued only in 2011 are excluded from this table. The sample of firms vary in the different panels: panel A comprises young firms
(younger than 10 years old in 2011), panel B comprises mature firms (10-30 years old in 2011), and panel C comprises old firms (31 years old or older in 2011). Total assets is in logs of thousands of 2011 U.S. dollars. All coefficients are reported in exponential form. Standard errors, shown
in brackets, are bootstrapped (using 400 replications) and clustered at the firm-level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.
