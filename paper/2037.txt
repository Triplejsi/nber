Wages, Employment, Training and Job Attachment
in Low Wage Labor Markets for Women

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes economic behavior and the effects of training and

income support policies in the low wage labor market for women.

The

opportunity set takes account of nonlinearities and discortinuities
associated with career interruption, part—time work, and government

programs. There are two sectors, one which rewards training and individual

ability, the other which does not and oers only the minimum wage.
Effects of policies are found to vary importantly among heterogeneous
groups of women according to ability and taste for children and household

work. Some preliminary empirical evidence is presented to narrow the
choice of specification.

Introduction

This paper analyzes economic behavior in the low waqe labor market for
women, and derives leplications for tralninp end

policies. On the

demand side, the opportunity set is based on a two sector model which
Incorporates the effects of trainino, career interruption and part—time
work on the path of wage offers over

the life cycle. On the supply side,

women with different abilities and preferences for children and home time

sort themselves among available opportunities. The incentive effects of
policies such as training, transfer and workfare programs are derived.

implications of the very different effects of policies on women with

dffprent abilities and tastes, and the implications of the findings for
the design of policy evaluations are discussed. Preliminary empirical
evidence is presented to narrow the choice between alternative
specifications of the model.

A number of economic relationships have been identified by previous
investigators as importantly influencing the life cycle pattern of labor

market and household outcomes. Women with different ability levels and
different preferences far children and home time (market work) will be

1978; Heckman, 1974 a and b; Heckman and Willis, 1977; and Moffitt, 1984).
One strand in the relevant literature has focused on the linkage between

the wage offer and career interruption (Polachek, l975 Mincer and
Polachek, 1974; Weiss and Gronau, 1981; Sandeli and Shapiro, 1978 and 1980;

Corcoran, 1979; Mincer and Ofek, 1982; Corcoran and Duncan, 1983). Another
aspect of the budget equation which has received attention is the the
nonlinear and discontinuous relation of the wage offer to hours of work

Roser. 197, a relationship that among other things may reflect a

reduction in intensity per hour of market work once women have children and

increased household responsibilities (Becker. 1985). Special attention has
also been given to the labor supply—fertility relation, especaliy in
reconciling findings from reduced form and structural specifications of
life cycle models (Rosensweig and Wolpin, 1980; Lehrer and Nerlove, 1981;

Carliner, Robinson and Tomes, 1984.
The model developed in the present paper incorporates those features
from previous studies which are relevant to an. analysis of policy in the
lOW wage labor market for women.

proper account of heterogeneity.

To be more specific about the opportunity set, the model of demand and
supply for low wage women specifies two types of full—time jobs.

Those in

the primary sector offer wages which reflect individual specific

differences in productivity. The wage offers in the primary sector also
reflect the costs and benefits of general training and any shared casts and

benefits of specific training. Jobs in the secondary sector pay all who
hold them at or close to the minimum wage and thus do not reward ability or
training to any significant degree.

considered and related

to measures of ability and mx ante measures of preference for homework and

pertaining to the role of opportunities for part—time work.
The organization of the paper is as follows.

The next section

discusses the specification of the opportunity set and the utility function
for a model of female labor supply and fertility decisions. The following

section characterizes the solution to the basic model.

Section IV

considers how individuals in such a model would react to training

subsidies to changes in the guarantee or benefit reduction rate of a
transfer program and to workfare under the assumption of rationing of low

wage jobs. Implications for current evaluations of training policies are
also noted. The following section discusses various possible extensions to
the model. Section VI presents the empirical results.

contains further observations about the model and a braef conclusion.

the children have left. During each of these periods, the wocan must
choose the level of her labor force participation and additionally in the
second period she must choose whether or not to have children.

These

decisions are influenced by her earnings possibilities in each of the
periods and by her relative preferences for income, vs. children and time
in the household.

that is specific and must be repeated after an interruption of primary

sector work. Thus in this model it is not depreciation and restoration of
human capital that accounts for reductions in the wage offer after
interruption, but only loss of specific human capital.

Previously trained primary sector workers may also work part—time at a

wage which depends on their ability and motivation. Denote this part—time
wage by w (s) .

Various assumptions may be made about the nature of the

relationship between w

and
p

a.

At one extremes it may be assumed that

C

w () is a constant function whose value is independent of

s.

This would

p

correspond to a situation where part—time work is available only in jobs
(perhaps in the secondary sector) where ability is not of real importance.

At the other extreme, it may be assumed that w (s) =
p

. In this case a

trained primary sector worker may cut back her hours without incurring any

waqe penalty. As will be shown shortly, the general nature of the model is
somewhat sensitive to the particular assumptions which are made concerning
the relationship between part—time wafles and ability.

For the secondary sector all individuals have the same value
of productivitv w_, a value that is at or slightly above the minimum wage,
and any woman who wants work in the secondary sector can qet this wage if

she works full—time. Waes for part—time work in the secondary sector

are given by w which may be taken to be equal to w5 or may be taken
to be somewhat lower.

Not every woman will have enough ability to earn as much in the

primary sector as she can in the secondary sector. Furthermore, even among
those who could earn more in the primary sector, not all of them will be
able to work there because the minimum wage may interfere with the training
required for employment in that sector.

At first glance, it might appear

that firm; would not be willing to train any woman whose productivity s(l

during her training period fails below the minimum wage w5 since

if they did so they would have to be paying her a wage above her

productivity during the training period. However, firms may be willing to
engage in an implicit contract to finance some of the traininq costs and
recoup the costs by paying wages below productivity for a period after the
training period.

employer plus the difference between productivity at the current firm once
training is completed and net productivity elsewhere is the maximum amount
that an employer would be willing to pay to a woman in training. Dividing

As a final consideration regarding earnings opportunities. the model

assumes that there are fixed costs C per time period if the woman engages
in either part—time or full—time work. This reflects the costs of getting

to and from work and additionally for women with children, the costs of

arranqing for child care. C thus represents the costs that are incurred
reqardless of the lenqth of the period that is worked. High fixed costs
are expected to make part—time work less attractive relative to full—time
work, since with part—time work there are fewer hours over which to spread
the costs.
The lJti 1 ity Function

The utility function summarizing preferences may be expressed as

U[y h(t), c 3), where y is total lifetime income,

is a binary variable with a

c

path of home time in the second period,

h<t) is the time

value of unity if the woman has children in the second period, and 8

is

an individual effect indicating relative preferences for children and home

tirne.O individuals with a high value of 8 place a hiqh value both on
having children and on home time spent with them, with the opposite being
true for individuals with a low value of

8.

To provide a basis for a tractable model, we suppose that this utility
function is separable in income:

U

= u(y)

J ÷T,
+ c

(t) v[ht) 8] dt

The function u, which describes the utility of income, is taken to be
such

that

the elasticity of marginal utility of income is qreater than zero
1

but does not exceed one.

The function v describes how the utility of a

woman who has children and home time h(t) compares to utility when there
are no children. For sirnplicity of exposition, it is assumed that the
value

of home time is less than the minimum wage, except for women with

children at home. Therefore, all women in the modei will work jr

the

first

and third periods, with the only question in those periods beinq the chojc

arid women without children will work U11 tlme in the S000fid

full—time, as at point D. A woman with a moderate desire for children, in
contrast, might find it preferable not to have children if she were to work
full—time, as indicated by the fact that point E lies below point A, but
would prefer to have children if she were to work only part—time or not at
all, and thus enjoy utility from children and home time as indicated either

by point F or point B. Finally, a woman who has little desire at all for
children might be characterized by HIJ, wherein utility actually rises when
she is workinq and is away from children (but note that the utility of this
individual never is as hiqh with children as can be obtained without
children)

This implies that a woman with higher ability will reenter the

appendix). However, these are the derivatives of the dates of reentering
the labor force and of resuming full—time work with respect to the desires

for children, and we would expect that in the normal case both of these

derivatives would be positive. Hence, in the remainder of the analysis
(except where noted to the contrary) we will assume that the conditions are
in fact met for these derivatives to be positive and refer to such
preferences as "normal,' remembering that cases are theoretically possible
for one (but not both) of them to be negative.

Given the signs of these derivatives, the slopes of IJ JK and KL are

For that reason the lines EF and GH, which indicate

the boundaries between full-time work and part—time work and between part—

time work and being out of the labor force respectively, are horizontal.
The line CD, which represents the boundary between women who have children

and those who do not. is also horizontal, primarily ama result of the fact
that the level of

for which the woman is indifferent between full-time

work with and without children in Figure 1 does not depend on
The exact positions of these boundaries are sensitive to, among other

things. the fixed costs of employment. In the appendix, it is shown that

positive and 3tJ3C is negative. Thus, women with higher

fixed costs of employment will begin part—time work. later and full—time

work sooner than will otherwise identical women with lower fixed costs
This is to be exoected. since the nioher faxed costs have a higher
proporti

full—time work.

The resulting effect of higher fixed costs is shown in

Fiqure

In

this

figure, higher-

fixed

costs shift the boundaries froe the

dashed lines to the solid lines. The figure indicates that the higher
fixed costs shrinks the areas of part—time employment in both panels. More
formally, the horizuntal direction of the shift of a segment such as

the panel (a, due to a higher value of C,

is given by

dtf/dS

Hence, this segment shifts leftwar-d with an increase in C The formal
derivations for the shifts of the other segments are similar.
In combination, these boundaries serve to separate the women at time
t.1

into four oroups: those with children who are working full—time, part—

time, and not at all, and those without children who are working full—time.
Over time during the second period, the

boundaries demarcating the area of

full—time work from the areas of either part—time work or nonparticipatin
and the boundary separating the areas of part—time work and

nonparticipation, must be moving uniformly downward. The only exception
occurs at the beginning of the second period, where the boundaries
involving full—time work in the primary sector [along IJL in Panel (a) of
Figure 2 or along 13 in Panel (b) of the figure] will remain stationary for

a while. this occurs because the retraining costs for dropping out of and
then reentering the primary sector will imply a minimum length for any
periods of nonparticipation and/or part—time work at the beginning of the
second period, with the result that the corresponding boundaries do not
move until this minimum length of time has passed.

IV.

Analysis of the Effects of Policy Changes

15

This section examines the effects upon fertility arid labor force

participation decisions of: a subsidy for the training of mothers with
children, an increase in the income guarantee available to low—income
mothers with children, and an increase in the marginal tax rate on earnings
of individuals who are receiving benefit payments.

In addition, reductions

in the guarantee and tax rate, or more directly a return to the market
situation analyzed earlier where there is no transfer program, may be taken
as an indication of the effects of a simple workfare program which replaces

the transfer for the full term of the life cycle. Note, however, that
because minimum wage jobs are available to all who want them, the
'workfare' is provided by low wage firms in the private sector.

For each

of these policy changes, the effects are to cause some individuals near
particular margins to change their behavior, which in Figure 2 amounts to
shifting some of the boundaries separating the regions at a particular
point in time.

If the policy changes are restricted to some subset of the

general population, then the analysis of this section will apply only to

the potentially eligible subpopuiation. In particular, most of the
programs of the type under consideration apply only to women who are heads

of households. Although the model does consider the decision to have
children as endogenous, marital status is not considered and hence is
effectively taken to be exogenous in determining who is eligible for a
program and who is not.

First consider the introduction of a training subsidy to be made

available to mothers with children. it is assumed that such a subsidy is
not available in the first period, before the fertility decision is made,

but is available in both the second and third per1os to individuals who

perverse result emerges. Individuals will tend to stay out of the labor
force longer than without a subsidy, and they will return to full—time work

later. This result stems primarily from the fact that among this qroup the
traininq subsidy induces only an income effect since these individuals
would have been

retrained anyway when they returned to

full—time work.

For some individuals with an ability level just below

the

subsidy may enable them to overcome the minimum wage obstacle and be
trained for work in the primary sector when they return to full—time work

after having their children. Whether or not this happens depends upon
whether an individual would be eligible for another subsidy if she were to
be trained by a second employer.

employers, then the equations in the first part of Section II which

the disutility of working full—time while raising children implies that the
additional income available as a result of being trained is insufficient to
compensate for the fact that the receipt of the training subsidy is

conditional on having children. The analysis thus implies that there is a
group of women with abilities between

and

above M'N and below

otherwise had in order to qualify for the subsidy.

In summary, then, the effects of a training subsidy depend critically
on the individual 's ability level. For ability levels between

the effects are as intended, with the trained women returning to full—

than they otherwise would have.

For ability levels above

the

of the training subsidy may well be perverse, while for ability levels

below , there

is no effect because the minimum wage will still prevent

these women from obtaining training.

There are implications of this discussion for econometric studies

designed to evaluate training programs. In the analysis of training
subsidies, the sharply different effects among different groups of women
imply that attempts to evaluate the effects of training programs which do
not carefully consider the differences and discontinuities in the wage
offer with ability interacted with sector of employment, stage of the life
cycle and full—time or part—time work, will produce numbers which are not
measuring what is intended.

If such studies are to isolate true program

be modeled in the conte>t of a structural model specified along the line of
the model outlined above so that those in each group can be distinguished.
FroQram effects can only be measured by comparing outcome differences

The result of an increase in the benefit reduction rate are
illustrated in Figure 6.

The net effect of such a change is to reduce the

effective returns to part—time work at relatively lower wages. The returns
to full—time work or part—time work at relatively higher wages are not
affected4 since there are no benefits to be reduced, and the returns to
nonparticipation are likewise riot affected, since there is no income upon

which the benefit reduction rate will operate. The result is to generate
substitution effects alonqall the boundaries involving part—time work at
relatively lower wages, so that individuals will begin part—time work later
and end part—time work in favor of full—time work sooner. The analyses of
both an increase ir the benefit reduction rate and of an increase in the
guarantee illustrate the importance of the distinction emphasized by Levy
(1981) and others between those whose earnings are beyond the breakeven and
those whose earnings are low enough to leave them eligible for the
program.

V.

Extensions of the Model.

The model that has been analyzed in the previous sections appears to
be amenable to several refinements which would increase its complexity

without changing its basic nature. First, note that the first period could

be eliminated without major changes in the analysis. This would occur if

the woman made the choice between having and not having children at the
beginning of her potential work career. Technically, this would do two
things to the model. One is to eliminate the

1 +

Y term

from the budget

constraint, since under these circumstances any work in the primary sector
would not be broken up

and as a

result retrairlir!q costs would be

irrelevant. The second would be ta eliminate the short period discussed at
the end of the last paragraph during which the boundaries would not move,
since this period of nonmovement was motivated by the retraining costs.

4 second refinement would be to allow

for productivity to be a

function of tenure, at least in the primary sector. Such an allowance
would have the effect of changing the exact expression of the marginal
conditions defining the boundaries between the various areas but should not

refinement would be to allow

more than one birth in the
sequence of births,

it seems

fairly clear tha.t the analysis before the first birth and after the last

birth would be largely unchanged, and that during the childbearing period a

model may well predict alternating labor force states. For instance, a
woman might drop out of the labor force for a year immediately succeeding
the birth of each child and then work part—time until the birth of the next

child.

Considerably more complex would be attempts to model additional

behavior within the actual childbearing period, including possibly attempts

to model the joint decisions regarding how many children to have, the
spacing between children, and the total length of the childbearing period.
Another refinement would consider the value of home time during

periods when children are not at home. For a woman who chooses not to have
children, for whom the value of home time is likely to be changing
relatively smoothly over time, a traditional life—cycle analysis of labor

force decisions should be applicable. For a woman who does choose to have
children, it is clear that the utility function used in the above analysis
could be extended to cover the first and third periods, probably without

severely affecting the analysis. In particular, this refinement would only
affect those women with children who are still at home or working part—time
at the end of the second period. since any woman working full—time toward
the end of the second period will presumably find it advantageous to work
full—time during the first and third periods, when the value of home time

is presumably less. A complete decision would then entail calculating the
optimal labor force behavior conditional both on having and not having
children, and making the choice regarding children so as to pick whichever
of the two paths yields a higher overall utility.
Finally, the model could introduce education as an alternative means
to acquire the necessary general training for primary sector workS

A

relatively simple but informative case would allow both the intensity and

23

duration of required general training to be inversely related to the amount

of education an individual has acquired. The monetary cost of the
education would be reflected in the budget constraint, and the time costs
would be reflected in a reduced amount of time available in the first

period. Such a modification would not affect the signs of the slopes
calculated for the various segments in Figures 2 and 3
movement in Figures 4 through 6.

or the directions of

However, the modification does have

implications for the effectiveness of a training subsidy.

In the original

modei there is a discrete utility difference between individuals just
below and just above the critical ablility level required for primary
sector employment, resulting in the implication that a marginal training
subsidy may result in non—marginal utility improvements for some

individuals. With endogenous education, the lower ability individuals can
use education to get around minimum wage constraints which are restraining

on—the—job general training in the primary sector. This process will be
carried to the point where the individual with marginal ability is just
indifferent between getting the education and working in the primary sector
and remaining in the secondary sector.

In this setting, marginal training

subsidies will result only in marginal utility improvements for the
individuals it induces into primary sector employment.

VI. Empirical Analysis
In this section we will begin the job of exploring the empirical

implications of the odi. ecause the model speaks to labor force
patterns traininq wage offers, the role of

ability

and tastes for

children and the interrelations among these variables, there are a large
number of empirical implications which are testable, and a number of
parameters which may be estimated by using increasingly complex econometric
n

techniques. Our

hope is to provide sufficient information tc determine

whether the outcomes highlighted by this approach are important, whether
the

general structure of the model seems reasonable and to provide

guidance for specification to be used in estimating a full structural
version of the model.
The empirical evidence

comes

from the National Longitudinal Survey of

Young Waen, which has surveyed for fifteen years women who were 14 to
years

24

old in 1968, the initial year of the survey. bout two—thirds of the

individuals

remained

in the survey in 1983, the last

year for which the

data have been made available. Thus for individuals who remained with the
survey for the full fifteen years, the survey covers the age spans from 14—

29 to 24-39. Particularly for women who were in their late teens when the
survey began, this fifteen year span covers just. the age range which is of
particular interest in terms of evaluatinq this model.

In evaluating the

statistics presented in this section, however, a word of caution is in
order.

higher

One might expect the general

levels of participation to be even

today than in the period covered by the

survey. Ultimately the

model should be able to account for these changes, but significant aspects

of behavior remain exogenous to our analysis. Accordingly simple
extrapnlation of the relations fitted here to future periods may be
inappropriate.

In the results which follow, the sample is restricted in several ways.

First, individuals are eliminated if they lack information on critical

variables. This most frequently arises in the cases of the ability (JQ)

variable and the taste variable. Regarding the ability variable, the NLS
lacks information on this variable for about 35 percent of the sample. As
for the taste variable, since this variable is constructed on the basis of

25

questions asked in the 1972 survey, it is missing for individuals who did
not remain

with

the survey until at least this time.1 The sample further

omits individuals who had not reached the age of 30 by the time of the last

survey which the particular individual completed. This is done to
eliminate cases in which the observed pattern of work behavior is too short

to impart meaningui information.
For each individual, the labor force behavior is examined in every
survey year following the survey year in which the individual last reported
full—time enrollment in school.

In each of these surveys, the individual

is classified as working full—time U , working part—time (pt) , or not in
the labor force (nlfl. The resulting sequences of labor force behavior
were then separated into four groups: (ii full—time work in all applicable
survey years, (ii) either full—time work or part—time work in all
applicable years, with at least some part—time work, (iii) sequences which
ir,clude at least some part—time work and some years not in the labor force,

and iv) either full—time work or a not in the labor force status in all

applicable years, with at least some years not in the labor force. These

four groups are denoted in the tables by ft, ft/pt, ft/pt/nlf, and
ft/nlf, respectively.
Table 2 presents regressions of each of these four groups on a set of
10 and taste variables, with standardization for birth year and race.

In

each regression, the dependent variable is a dummy variable ta:ing on a
value of unity if the individual had a labor force participation pattern of

the indicated type. The 10 and

taste

variables are each separated into

three categories so that roughly equal numbers of those with a high school
education or less -fall into each category. For the 10 variable, the low
category is 1 and the high category is 3, whereas for the taste variable a
value of 1 indicates a

strong

taste for children and home time and a value

26

of 3 indicates a weak taste.

It should be kept in mind that ID is

admittedly an imperfect measure of the underlying theoretical construct of
ability—related earnings power.

lable 3 is derived from the estimates of Table 2 and attempts to

present the information in a more useful form. For each of the reqres5jon
in Table 2, the coefficients of each of the ID—taste combinations is
adjusted up or down so that the weighted sum of the coefficients is zero.
Then the resulting coefficients are arranged in a grid corresponding to the
various ID—taste combinations, and corresponding also in a rough manner to

the axes of Figure 2 of Section Ill. The actual entries in Table 3
indicate the amounts by which the average fraction of individuals in a
particular sequence must be adjusted up or down for the particular cell.
For example, the first entry indicated that for the low ID and high taste
for children and home life combination, there would be 11.6 percent fewer
individuals with continuous full—time participation than there would be for
the complete sample (again, correcting for birth year and race).
In comparing the entries of Table 3 with the two panels of Figure 2,
it is evident that they correspond much better to panel (b) of the figure
than to panel (a).

To see this, consider the figure to be pictured for the

time immediately after the second period begins.

In this case, any

individuals below the lines EFIJL in panel (a) and EFIJ in panel (b) should

always be observed in the full—time status. Sequences

involving only -full—

time and part—time work should originate from areas of the figure in which
the individual elects part—time work at the beginning of the second period.
Sequences involving some part—time work and some time not in the labor
force should arise if the individual is in the area above GHKJ in panel (a)

or above GHKL in panel (b). Finally,

27

sequences involving some time not in

the labor force but no part—time work can arise from an individual
initially above JL in panel (a).

These sequences can also arise in panel

(b) if the fixed costs of employment are sufficiently high so that the
left—hand portions of EF and 6H and of IJ and KL became coincident. In
this regard, it may be more appropriate in an empirical model to regard the
fixed costs of employment as a stochastic variable which varies from

individual to individual. In a situation such as panel (b), lower ability
individuals with high fixed costs who begin the second period not working
would proceed directly to full—time work, while individuals with similar
ability but lower fixed costs would go through a period of part—time work.
For higher ability individuals, high fixed costs are less likely to induce
a transition directly from not working to full—time work. The empirical
implication is that in this panel, lower ability workers as a group should
be less likely to have work patterns with at least some part—time work.

in looking at Table 3 it is evident that continuous full—time work is
depressed in the upper left part of the table and enhanced in the lower

right part of the table. This is exactly what one would expect from either
panel of the figure, however4 and although it is consistent with the model
it does little to distinguish which panel in the figure is closer to the
truth.

The situation is much different when the last kind of sequence is

examined4 however. This is the sequence which contains some years not in
the labor force but no part—time work.

In the table, it is seen that this

hind of behavior is considerably more common among individuals with lower
IG scores., contrary to what would be expected if panel

(a) of the figure

were correct. Given relatively high fixed costs of employment, however,
this behavior is consistent with panel (b) of the figure.

In this case,

what is happening is that the high fixed costs of employment make part—time
work

what might be expected on the basis of the theoretical model, since
sequences involving some time not working should begin in the upper part of
the diagram where tastes for home and family time are high.
There is

another

piece of

evidence which also suggests that Panel (b)

of Figure 2 may be the closer to the true model. For any woman who
experienced both full—time and part—time work, and for whom valid wages
could be calculated for both, the full—time wages are averaged into a
single number, and the same is done for all part—time wage observations.
Siven a single full—time average wage and a single part—time average wage
for each woman, the correlation between the two was calculated for the

women in the sample. The simple correlation is 0.41 over 1586 individuals,
and the implied regression coefficient of part—time on full—time wages is
0.70.

These imply a fairly strong positive relationship between the full—

time and part—time wages, which is somewhat more consistent with Panel (b)
than Panel (a) in the figure.

VII. Summary and Conclusions
This paper has presented a model which incorporates a number of

L

features from the low waqe labor market for women. The model has been used
to analyze alternative patterns of labor market participation and home time

over the life cycle. The critical labor market choices are whether or not
to interrupt the career, whether or not to work part—time, and when to
return to full—time work, with all these choices conditioned on the

individuals own ability, on the penalties for career interruption and for
part—time work, and on the woman s preference for home time and children.
Reasons for differences in wage offers associated with each regime were
analyzed in the context of a two sector model of the labor market.

In one

sector there was traininq, which was a mix of specific and general, while
the other offered jobs with wages at or just above the minimum wage.
Ability differences were assumed to be associated with wage offer
differences for full—time work in the primary sector, but not for full—time
work in the secondary sector.

Among the policy measures which can be analyzed in the context of this
model, the most interesting results are obtained for a training subsidy for

mothers with children. Such a subsidy does permit some women with marginal
ability levels to qualify for training programs whereas they would not be

able to obtain training without the subsidies. For higher ability women,
however, the result is perverse in the sense that it delays both the return
to the labor force and the resumption of full—time work after the

childbearing period. On the other hand, changes in the guarantee and/or
marginal tsx rates on benefits for low income mothers have the effects

which might be more or less expected from casual observation. An increase
in the guarantee will tend to reduce full—time work and increase both part—
time work and nonparticipation, at least on the assumption that full—time

workers earn sufficient income to be ineligible for the benefit. On the

same assumption. a reduction in the marginal tax

rate

will tend to increase

part—time work at the expense of both full—time work and nonparticipation.
Perhaps the strongest implications of the analysis pertain to

evaluations of training programs. These evaluations frequently attempt to
isolate program impacts by comparing outcomes for program completers with

those who are thought to be comparable due to their demographic

characteristics and earnings histories. There are a couple of particularly
treacherous problems for evaluation studies suggested by the model.

First,

it is important not to confuse changes in wage rates which are brought
about by training programs with changes which are due to changes in labor

supply. This is particularly likely to be a problem for ar individual who
is working part—time before entering into the program. Secondly, the
analysis shows that a training program affects two quite different groups.
There is a fairly small group whose members would not obtain training at
all without the program, and for these individuals the effect of training
is a good measure of the effect of the program. However, there is a larger
group for whom the program affects only the timing of training and work
decisions, and for this group the relation between having participated in a
training program and the subsequent wage is likely to overstate
substantially the effect of the program.
The empirical analysis is more suggestive than conclusive, but it does
appear to indicate that the general implications of the model are broadly
consistent with data drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young
Women.

It indicates fairly strongly that a more complete empirical

ifiodel of the sequences of work and home decisions of young women should

embed a part—time wage that is correlated with full—time wages, and that
such a model should probably also consider fixed employment costs which are
possibly different from one woman to the next.

31

In view of these results,

it would appr appropriate to pursue further this analysis with the
eventual aim of developing a structural empirical model suitable for policy
analysis

Footnote a
I.

In addition to the choices about labor supply and whether or not

to have children, choices analyzed n the model, a young woman makes
related choices about schooling, marriage, and concerning number, spacing
and quality of children, perhaps making preliminary plans simultaneously
for each, some more tentatively than others, and then modifying these plans

in light of realizations of stochastic variables. Considerable work has
been done on these issues.

(For two examples of many, see Weiss and

Sronau, 198l and Heckman, Hotz and Walker, 1985.)

In order to focus on

the basic labor market decisions and their interactions with the decision
as to whether or not to have children, the model abstracts from the

marriage and schooling decisions, treats fertility as certain ignores
questions about number and spacing of children, and adopts certain
assumptions that will have the effect of fixing the woman's age at first

birth. Thus while the model brings together many important determinants of
behavior, there is a long way to go.

Some of the problems created by conditioning parts of the empirical
analysis on what are endoqenous outcomes are discussed by Heckman and

Willis (1977). Although the model conditions on formal schooling, note
that its structure is compatible with the model developed by Lehrer and
Nerlove (1981), where the endogeneity of the schooling decision is
emphasized,

it would be straight forward to extend our model to include

the decision, but would, of course, add to the complexity of the solution.

In this case,

There are two reasons for specifyinq the consumption argument in the

utility function in terms of lifetime income. First preferences are
specified in terms of lifetime income rather than in terms of income spent
in each period separately because the model is not particularly concerned
with the pattern of consumption over time.

(Problems created by borrowing

constraints and the implications of these problems for this analysis are

discused in footnote 13 below.) Second, an assumption that the minimum
wage is fixed in terms of primary sector output allows us to specify this
argument as a function of income rather than of consumption of each of the

two goods produced by the economy. The reason is that the least capable
group of secondary sector workers must be paid the minimum wage, and fixing
its value in terms of primary sector output has the effect of dictatina the

price ratio between the outputs of the two sectors. Then the composite
commodity theorem implies that preferences may be expressed in terms of
income rather than in terms of the consumption amounts of the two goods

If the elasticity exceeds unity

In section II, on the job training costs were assumed to involve a

fraction of the real wage.

In this circumstance, as long as the rate of

real wage growth and the real interest rate are similar, OJT itself creates
no incentive to work earlier in the second period. Otherwise, if the woman
were to leave the labor force for the same amount of time later in the

period she would not earn any more income, but would lose more utility
than she would were she to leave the labor force for an equal length of

time at the beginning of the period. Similarly, if the woman works part—
time at any time during the second period, it should be after she has taken
her time (if any) out of the labor force, but before any full—time work
during the period.

As is shown jr the appendix, the condition .3t/.3s

is strictly required only if the fixed costs of employment are small.

0therwise the sign of this derivative is indeterminate.
11.

Another general solution exists for the model, as illustrated in

Appendix Figure Al. This solution, however, corresponds to a situation in

which no low—wage women (i.e. those who can only work in the secondary
sector) with children are working full—time at the beginning of
period.

This would rot be true if the discounted value of the subsidy to the

subsidy, since this individual is restricted to the lower part—

time wage until after she returns to full—time work in the second period.
with the higher wages available only then. (In all other cases, individuals
who could expect higher earrings after the childbearing period would find

them available in the first period as well.) However, there are a couple
of considerations which might mitigate the effects of any borrowing

constraints. First, there is the characteristic of children that younger
children tend to be expensive in terms of time while older children tend to

be expensive in terms of resources. This means that by the time the
financial demands of children are reaching their peaks, the woman may well

have already returned to full—time work. nd secondly, the period of
children is not the only stage of the life cycle in which expenditures may

exceed income there is also the phase of retirement, which may be regarded

as occurring after the third period in the model. Hence some of the
increased earning power after the individual returns to full—time work may
simply enable individuals to service their expected retirement needs.
Despite these considerations, it may nevertheless be the case that
individuals in the second period are constrained by borrowing constraints.
If so, the utility function must be written in terms of income available in
each period rather than in terms simply of total income.

In this

circumstance, one might expect the major points of the paper, including the

anomalous effects of training subsidies and the cautions regarding

evaluation studies of training subsidies to persist even in a borrowing
constrained model if the utility function entails a reasonable degree of

substitutability of income in different periods. The analysis would become
more complicated, thouqhq and consideration would have to be given to the
possibility that there may be particular sets of circumstances in which
these findings might no longer hold.
14.

Our analysis assumes that training programs are permanent arid well

understood. Evaluation studies based either on econometric techniques or
on a classic experimental desiqn, must also deal with the difficulties
created by temporary programs. The introduction of new programs and
subsequent reoptimization, and the inability to count on current programs
being around in future years will lead to behavior different from what
would be observed with a permanent program available over the long term.

If a training program is perpetually availabie there is an optimal time
for the individual to enroll that may not be available when the program is
temporary.
15.

The taste variable is formed on the basis of twelve attitudinal

questions which were asked in the 1972 survey. (Specifically, these

variables are reference numbers 3867—3878 in the survey.) For each
question, the five possible responses are arranged so that the lowest
response corresponds to an attitude of wanting to be home during periods
when children are present and the hiohest response reflects an attitude
that work is all right snd even desirable during periods when young

children are present in the household. The responses so ordered are
assigned values of i to 5 for each question and are summed across the

twelve questions. The resulting sums are broken into three categorical

The first term on each side of this expression is the rate at which the

However, the fractions

of diminishing marginal utility one would expect the marginal utility of

full—time hours to be greater. Hence, whether the above relation holds or
does not hold depends upon the specific parameters in the utility function.

As a final topic in the appendix, we consider the situation where no
low—wage women with children elect to work full—time in the early part of

the second period. This is the case illustrated in Figure Al, and it
corresponds to an instance in which the slope of the segments in Figure 1
between full—time and part—time work are relatively steeper, so that at

51

sufficiently low waqe levels women would not find it advantaqeous to work

full-time if they have children. Ps time passes in the second period, the
areas corresponding to nonparticipation and to part--time work will move

upward in the diaqram, for exactly the same reasons as discussed in the

text and earlier in this appendix. However, the boundary separating women
with children and women without children must remain fixed throuqhout the
period, so that although later on in the period the boundaries between

full—time wurk part—time works and nonparticipation will look much like
Figure 2. the boundary between women with and without children will not be
the horizontal segment pictured in Figure 2 but will continue to be the

segment pictured in Figure 1. Note that in this case there is a positive
association between the

ard the minimum level of 9 for which the

woman will choose to have children.
