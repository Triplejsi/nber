ABSTRACT
The price-rent ratio is highly volatile and predicts future returns for commercial real estate. Price-rent
variations in commercial real estate also tend to comove with investment and output. We develop a
general equilibrium model that explicitly introduces a rental market and incorporates collateral constraints
on production as a key ingredient. Our estimation identifies discount-rate shocks as the most important
factor in (1) driving price-rent variations, (2) producing the long-horizon predictability of real estate
returns, and (3) linking the dynamics in commercial real estate to those in the production sector.

DISCOUNT SHOCK, PRICE-RENT DYNAMICS, AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

1

I. Introduction
The rise and fall of real estate prices in the past decades and the 2008 financial crisis
triggered by the collapse of real estate prices have generated a great deal of research on the
impact of real estate prices on the macroeconomy. Most research has focused on consumers’
behavior and the residential real estate market. When we study firms’ investment dynamics,
it is often the commercial real estate market that becomes relevant. In a recent paper,
Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmar (2012) provide micro evidence that links the commercial real
estate price to investment. They estimate that a $1 increase in a representative U.S. firm’s
value of real estate raises its investment by $0.06. At the aggregate level, however, the link
between commercial real estate prices and investment dynamics has been largely unexplored.
In this paper we develop a medium-size dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
model and show that this model is capable of reproducing quantitatively a variety of stylized
facts about the commercial real estate price and the business cycle if one incorporates two
key ingredients: shocks to households’ discount rate and collateral constraints on firms’ production. We confront our model with financial and macroeconomic time series and estimate
the model using the Bayesian method to account for the following facts:
(1) Volatility: Commercial real estate price fluctuates much more than rent and output
do. Over the past 20 years, while the volatility (measured by the standard deviation
of quarterly changes) is 1.245% for rent and 0.697% for output, the volatility of real
estate prices is 4.171%.
(2) Long-horizon predictability: Price-rent variation predicts long-horizon real estate returns.1 Simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of real estate returns at
different horizons on the rent-price ratio (the valuation ratio) show that the slope
coefficients are significantly positive and they increase with the horizon and that the
fit measure, R2 , also increases with the horizon. Figure 1 plots the contemporaneous
price-rent ratio against real estate returns of the subsequent five years to capture the
key fact: high prices relative to rents have preceded many years of low returns and
low prices have preceded high returns.
(3) Comovement: The price-rent ratio tends to comove with output as demonstrated by
Figure 2. The contemporaneous correlation between output and price-rent ratio is
0.83 for log level and 0.48 for year-over-year growth.2
How to reproduce all these macro-finance facts within one structural framework has been a
central but challenging task in the macro-finance literature. Our model builds on the DSGE

literature with a combination of two distinctive features: we introduce a rental market
of commercial real estate and assume that firms face collateral constraints when financing
working capital. Without modeling the rental market explicitly, the existing macroeconomic
models (Iacoviello, 2005; Iacoviello and Neri, 2010; Liu, Wang, and Zha, 2013; Liu, Miao, and
Zha, 2016, for example) show that real estate price and rent move in comparable magnitude
so that there is little price-rent variation in comparison to the data. But price-rent variation
is central to both the long-horizon predictability of real estate returns (Cochrane, 2011;
Ghysels, Plazzi, Torous, and Valkanov, 2013) and the business cycle (Figure 2).
By controlling for an array of commonly used shocks such as technology and labor supply
shocks, we find that shocks to the discount rate are the key to generating the data dynamics
that quantitatively reproduce stylized facts (1)-(3). The key intuition is that the rental price
of commercial real estate is determined by the marginal product of the real estate property
in firms’ production, but the real estate price is a forward looking variable, equal to the
discounted present value of future rents. Shocks to such a discount are intertemporal and
affect future appreciations of the price; they do not directly affect the current rent.
The discount-rate shock is a parsimonious way of modeling the variation in discount rates
stressed by Hansen and Jagannathan (1991), Campbell and Ammer (1993) and Cochrane
(2011) and can sometimes be interpreted as a sentiment shock as in Barberis, Shleifer, and
Vishny (1998) and Dumas, Kurshev, and Uppal (2009). In the macroeconomic literature
(Smets and Wouters, 2003; Primiceri, Schaumburg, and Tambalotti, 2006; Galı́, 2015, for
example), the discount-rate shock is called a “preference” shock to capture shifts in aggregate
demand; its asset pricing implications were first discussed by Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo,
and Rebelo (2016), who construct a general equilibrium model of an endowment economy to
show that discount-rate shocks can generate the observed risk premium and weak correlation
between consumption growth and stock returns. In their model, however, these shocks do
not affect macroeconomic movements or generate the long-horizon predictability of excess
stock returns.
We follow Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2016) by introducing discountrate shocks and extend their model to a production economy with an emphasis on the
implications of commercial real estate prices on investment and the business cycle. One key
contribution of our paper is to show that in our production economy model, discount-rate
shocks can generate price-rent fluctuations over the business cycle. Because firms’ collateral
assets provide the collateral (liquidity) premium, discount-rate shocks can also generate the
long-horizon predictability of excess real estate returns. These discoveries are important
for several reasons. First, the long-horizon predictability is prevalent in the asset pricing
literature in general and the real estate literature in particular. Which shock in general
equilibrium models can generate the data dynamics reproducing the predictability result has

DISCOUNT SHOCK, PRICE-RENT DYNAMICS, AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

been an open and challenging issue. Second, the discount-rate shock in our model is an
macroeconomic shock commonly used in the literature. What is new in our paper is the
finding that the collateral channel for firms’ production, as documented by Chaney, Sraer,
and Thesmar (2012), is essential for reproducing facts (1)-(3). Third, our estimation shows
that the discount-rate shock is an empirically important source for the linkage between the
real estate market and the business cycle. Moreover, the quantitative importance of the
real estate value for investment at the macro level is consistent with the findings of Chaney,
Sraer, and Thesmar (2012) at the micro level.
The existing general equilibrium models with real estate markets typically fail to generate
price-rent variation.3 One exception is Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Nieuwerburgh (2017), who
study a calibrated two-sector overlapping-generations model of housing and non-housing
production in which heterogeneous households face limited opportunities to insure against
aggregate and idiosyncratic risks. They examine how a relaxation of financing constraints
leads to a large boom in house prices. Another exception is Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante
(2017), who study house prices and their impact on household consumption by incorporating
several macroeconomic shocks. They introduce a rental market in residential real estate and
find that shocks to agent beliefs about future demand of real estate are the main driver of
price-rent variation. Their belief shocks are similar to our discount-rate shocks in the sense
that both types of shocks affect the expectations of future house price appreciation.
Our emphasis is different: we develop a general equilibrium model with a production
economy that is tractable to be estimated against the data and focus on some key asset
pricing aspects of the general equilibrium model. We find that discount-rate shocks are
the only macroeconomic shocks driving the large movements of commercial real estate price
relative to rent. In our model, moreover, price-rent variation generated by discount-rate
shocks is central to the dynamic interactions between the commercial real estate price and
the business cycle. Traditional business-cycle shocks, such as shocks to technology and
labor supply, cannot explain price-rent movements that are quantitatively comparable to
the observed time series.
Although price-rent variation is necessary for the long-horizon predictability of real estate
returns, it is by no means sufficient. We show that in response to discount-rate shocks,
firms’ real estate values used as collateral play a key role in generating both the long-horizon
predictability and the high volatility of real estate prices observed in the data. The rise

of real estate prices relaxes a firm’s collateral constraint and thus facilitates its production,
while the rental price determined by the marginal product of real estate property does not
move much. This result underlies the comovement between price-rent ratio and output. In
the decomposition of real estate price, our estimation reveals that collateral values contribute
to one third of the volatility of real estate prices while rents contribute very little.
Our estimated discount-rate shock itself exhibits an extremely small volatility (0.067%),
but this small persistent shock contributes to not only all of the observed large price-rent
fluctuation (3.91%) but also 48% of the observed investment fluctuation (1.68%) and a quarter of the observed output fluctuation (0.70%). Although the discount-rate shock connects
the dynamics in the real estate market to those in the production sector, it is the model’s
internal transmission mechanism that amplifies this small shock into the large volatilities
of price-rent ratio, investment, and output. Thus, our findings demonstrate the importance
of incorporating discount-rate shocks and firms’ collateral values in an otherwise standard
DSGE model, in order to account for various asset pricing facts and their relationship to the
business cycle.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we construct a medium-size
general equilibrium model with a production economy. In Section III we estimate the model
against several U.S. time series, report the estimated results, analyze the impulse responses,
and discuss the linkage between price-rent dynamics and aggregate fluctuations. Section IV
presents the empirical results of the predictability of real estate returns and the volatilities of
real estate price, investment, and output. Section V studies a simplified version of the model
to gain intuition into our empirical findings by deriving the closed-form theoretical results.
Section VI concludes the paper. Detailed derivations, proofs, and estimation procedures are
provided in appendices.

II. The model
We study an economy with a representative household, a continuum of intermediate-goods
producers, and a continuum of heterogeneous final-goods firms. The representative household
maximizes its utility and accumulates physical capital. There are a variety of intermediate
goods and each good is produced by a continuum of identical competitive producers. The
heterogeneous final-goods firms are indexed by idiosyncratic productivity shocks. They trade
commercial real estate properties among themselves and rent out real estate properties to
intermediate-goods producers. Financial frictions occur in the final-goods sector; firms in
this sector borrow against their real estate value to finance working capital.

intermediate good j ∈ [0, 1] is produced by a continuum of identical competitive producers
of measure unity. The representative producer owns a constant-returns-to-scale technology
to produce good j by hiring labor Nt (j), renting real estate property Ht (j) from final-goods
firms, and renting capital Kt (j) from the household. The producer’s decision problem is

III. Estimation and analysis
III.1. Data and estimation. We take the Bayesian approach and estimate the log-linearized
version of the model presented in Section II. The model has six commonly used macroeconomic shocks represented by AR(1) processes (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6). It is estimated
against a number of key U.S. time series over the period from 1995Q2 to 2017Q2:5 the pricerent ratio in commercial real estate, the quality-adjusted relative price of investment, real

lags in estimation. Therefore, the sample including four lags begins in 1995Q2.

per capita consumption, real per capita investment (in consumption units), and per capita
hours worked.6 Since our model features long-run growth, we detrend our model to make it
stationary. We use x̃t to denote the detrended variable of xt and use x̂t ≡ log x̃t − log x̃ to
denote the log deviation from the steady-state value x̃. The detailed description of data and
estimation method are provided in Appendices A and B.7
There are five structural parameters to be estimated: the inverse Frisch elasticity ν, the
collateral elasticity χ, the steady-state elasticity of capacity utilization δ 00 /δ 0 , the habit formation γ, and the investment adjustment cost Ω. In particular, the collateral elasticity parameter χ measures a percentage change in the endogenous total factor productivity (TFP)
in response to a one-percent change in the collateral value relative to output (see Appendix
C for interpretations). The other structural parameters are either calibrated or indirectly
estimated by solving the steady state (see Appendix B and Supplemental Appendix G for
details).
The five directly estimated parameters are reported in Table 1, along with 90% probability
intervals. The posterior probability intervals indicate that all these structural parameters are
tightly estimated. The estimated inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply is 0.34, consistent
with a range of values discussed in the literature (Keane and Rogerson, 2011). The collateral
elasticity is tightly estimated around 0.045. According to Appendix C, we calculate that
aggregate investment through the endogenous TFP increases by 0.2% for a 1% increase in
the collateral value (relative to output).8
The steady state elasticity of capacity utilization δ 00 /δ 0 is 0.85, in line with a range of
values reported in the literature (Jaimovich and Rebelo, 2009). The small value means that
an increase in the marginal cost is small when capacity increases, which implies that capacity
is responsive to shocks. The estimated habit formation γ and capital-adjustment cost Ω are
very small. Hence, these factors are not important in driving the dynamics of consumption
and investment.
Table 2 reports the estimated persistence and standard-deviation parameters of exogenous
shock processes. Among all shocks, the discount-rate shock is the most persistent. But its
estimated standard deviation is considerably smaller than those of all other shocks except the
stationary investment-specific shock. The probability intervals for the estimated standard
6In

Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmar (2012), commercial real estate prices are approximated by house prices

because these two series are highly correlated (the correction is over 0.90). All our empirical results hold
for house prices as well; see our previous working paper (Miao, Wang, and Zha, 2014). In this paper, we
construct the time series of commercial real estate price ourselves.
7The complete equilibrium system, the detrended stationary equilibrium system, the steady state, and
the log-linearized equilibrium system are presented in Supplemental Appendices E, F, G, and H.
8This estimated elasticity is in line with the observed evidence during the Great Recession period when
investment dropped by 11% while commercial real estate price (relative to output) dropped by 39%.

deviation of the discount-rate shock are particularly tight. Such a small standard deviation
implies that any large effects on real estate price and aggregate variables must come from
the model’s internal propagation mechanism, which is discussed in Section III.3.

III.2. Impulse responses of discount-rate and technology shocks. Our focus in this
paper is on the financial and real impacts of discount-rate shocks after controlling for all
other common shocks studied in the literature. Among other common shocks, the permanent
neutral technology shock is most important in driving the business cycle. We thus compare
the estimated dynamic responses to a discount-rate shock with those to a technology shock
in Figures 3 and 4. Although the discount-rate shock process is assumed to be of AR(1) and
the estimated capital-adjustment cost is extremely small, the discount-rate shock generates
a sizable hump-shaped response of investment in magnitude comparable to the dynamic
response to a technology shock. In the following subsection (Section III.3), we explain the
model’s propagation mechanism for generating such a hump shape.
The dynamic responses of labor hours to discount-rate and technology shocks also have a
similar magnitude, although the initial two-quarter response of hours to a technology shock is
negative due to the wealth effect of a permanent nature of this shock. Large differences show
up in the dynamic responses of real estate price, rent, and consumption. To a technology
shock, the dynamic responses of these three variables are comparable in magnitude, but
the comparability breaks down for the responses to a discount-rate shock (Figure 4). The
dynamic response of real estate price to a discount-rate shock is considerably larger than the
response to a technology shock, while the dynamic response of rent to a discount-rate shock
is much smaller than the response to a technology shock. As a result, the price-rent ratio
responds more to a discount-rate shock than to a technology shock by orders of magnitude.
It can be seen from Figures 3 and 4 that the price-rent ratio comoves with investment and
therefore output in response to a discount-rate shock, as we observe in the data (Figure 2).
The dynamic response of aggregate output to a discount-rate shock is about one third
of the response to a technology shock (top row of Figure 3). This difference is because the
consumption response to a discount-rate shock is much smaller than to a technology shock.
Although the consumption response to a discount-rate shock is negative initially for the first
year, it rises subsequently for most of the five-year horizon. Without financial frictions,
by contrast, the consumption response to a discount-rate shock is negative for almost the
entire forecasting period of five years while the responses of investment and hours remain
positive (solid lines in Figure 5). Moreover, the response of real estate price from the model
without financial frictions is significantly smaller than the response from the benchmark
model. Thus, the two ingredients commonly used in the modern macroeconomic literature,
credit constraint and endogenous TFP, are essential to mitigating the opposite movements

between consumption and investment responses as well as to generating a large volatility of
real estate price.
III.3. Propagation mechanism. A tractable feature of our heterogeneous model is that
one can obtain a closed-form solution to the aggregation problem. The closed-form solution is
essential to make our estimation and empirical analysis feasible. In Supplemental Appendix E
we list all the equilibrium equations for solving and estimating the model. In this subsection
we emphasize the key equilibrium dynamics and highlight the role of financial frictions in
the transmission mechanism.

Proposition 1 states that the average cost of intermediate goods, a∗t , is also a threshold
productivity level, above which productive firms choose to produce. For a given value of Yt ,
equation (11) describes the relationship between the threshold productivity a∗t and the real
estate price pt . This relationship is represented by an upward sloping curve on the (a∗t , pt )
graph (see the bottom panel of Figure 6). Since equation (11) is derived from the collateral
constraint, we call this relationship the collateral constraint curve.
The asset pricing equation (13) in Proposition 2 departs from the standard one in that
the SDF and rent are not the only factors moving the real estate price. In addition to the
future rent, the future collateral premium represented by
Z

∞

a∗t+1

a − a∗t+1
f (a)da
a∗t+1

also influences the real estate price. For productive firms (ait+1 ≥ a∗t+1 ), the collateral
premium reflects the average profit generated by a one-dollar credit. Our estimation shows
that the collateral premium, not the rent, accounts for at least one third of the volatility in
the real estate price.
Equation (14) shows that the discount-rate shock does not affect the current rent Rct
directly. It has an indirect effect through its impact on other variables such as Nt and a∗t .
On the other hand, the discount-rate shock has a direct effect on the expected appreciation
of future prices through its impact on the SDF (βΛt+1 /Λt ) as in equation (13). Consequently,
the discount-rate shock has the potential to explain the high volatility of price-rent ratios.
The relationship between a∗t and pt represented by the asset pricing equation is negative,
holding everything else fixed. An increase in the current threshold productivity level a∗t raises
the future threshold productivity level a∗t+1 . As a∗t+1 rises, the future collateral premium falls.
Since the real estate price is a forward looking variable, the current price falls as well. Thus,
the asset pricing curve representing (13) is downward sloping on the (a∗t , pt ) plane. The two
curves, collateral constraint and asset pricing, determine a∗t and pt jointly in the financial
market as plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 6.
To make transparent the connection between the real estate market and the production
economy, one should note that the real wage and labor hours are jointly determined by the
labor supply equation

The top panel of Figure 6 plots two curves on the (Nt , Yt ) graph, with the convex curve
representing the production equation (12) and the concave curve representing the labormarket equation (15).
A discount-rate shock affects both real and financial sectors simultaneously. Figure 6
illustrates the transmission mechanism of this shock. Suppose that the initial equilibrium is
Point A at the steady state. According to equation (13), a positive shock to discount rate
delivers a direct impact on the real estate price through the SDF (βΛt+1 /Λt ), shifting the
asset pricing curve upward and raising the threshold productivity. As
Z ∞
1
T F Pt ≡
af (a)da

is driven by the response of a∗t to the discount-rate shock, a rise of threshold productivity
increases aggregate output through the endogenous TFP and thus demand for investment
and credit to finance working capital. An increase of aggregate output shifts the collateral
constraint curve upward according to equation (11). The direct effect of the discount-rate
shock on asset prices dominates the indirect effect on aggregate output so that the net effect
on the threshold productivity is positive (bottom panel of Figure 6). The equilibrium moves
from Point A to Point B on impact, with an increase of both threshold productivity and real
estate price.
As an increase of threshold productivity raises aggregate output on impact and shifts the
production curve upward, it simultaneously shifts the labor-market curve upward so long as
the endogenous TFP relative to the average cost a∗t

increases with a∗t and its impact on consumption (and its marginal utility Λt ) is relatively
small.
With capital accumulation, it is optimal for households to postpone consumption for
investment. Thus, the hump-shaped response of investment propels a further increase of
aggregate output and thus shifts the asset pricing curve further in subsequent periods. As
a result of higher investment and output, the collateral constraint curve moves up further,
generating an even higher real estate price. As long as the discount-rate shock is persistent
as in our estimation, both the asset pricing curve and the collateral constraint curve continue
to shift upward, moving the equilibrium from Point B to Point C (bottom panel of Figure 6),

DISCOUNT SHOCK, PRICE-RENT DYNAMICS, AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

13

with a persistent increase in the real estate price. In equilibrium, however, the threshold
productivity level a∗t does not have to move much as shown in the figure.
At the same time, a higher level of investment continues to shift the production curve and
the labor-market curve upward, moving the equilibrium from Point B to Point C (top panel
of Figure 6) and generating even higher output. The ripple effect through such interactions
between the financial setor and the production sector is the key feature of this propagation
mechanism.
IV. Predictability and volatility
The preceding section documents the dynamic responses of key financial and economic
variables to a discount-rate shock and explains the propagation mechanism behind the linkage
between financial and production sectors. In the real estate sector, a key fact is that the pricerent ratio has a long-horizon predictability of real estate returns (Ghysels, Plazzi, Torous,
and Valkanov, 2013). The observed linkage between real estate and production sectors is the
comovements between price-rent ratio, investment, and output. These comovements imply
that the volatility of price-rent ratio and the volatilities of investment and output are not
isolated. From the lense of our general equilibrium model, the discount-rate shock is the
only shock that relates price-rent variation to the volatilities of investment and output. An
important question is how much of the observed predictability and volatility can be explained
by the dynamics generated by discount-rate shocks.
IV.1. Empirical results of predictability. Ghysels, Plazzi, Torous, and Valkanov (2013)
argue that the price-rent ratio should have power in predicting real estate returns and propose
to run the predictive regression
rt→t+k = α0 + α1 log (Rct /pt ) + εt,k ,
where the real estate return from t to t + k is defined as rt→t+k = log (pt+k /pt ) and the
slope coefficient α1 is positive.9 Table 3 reports the regression results of the slope coefficient
α1 and the fit measure R2 from both actual and model-simulated data at different horizons
(k = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24). Using the posterior mode estimates of model parameters, we simulate
a sample of time series of model variables with only discount-rate shocks for 88 periods (the
same length as the actual sample size). For each simulated sample, we run the previous
predictive regression. We repeat the simulation 100,000 times and compute the median
9Following

Ghysels, Plazzi, Torous, and Valkanov (2013) and the real estate literature, we use returns

without rent in our empirical estimation. Since the time series data on real estate price and rent are available
only in index format, we are unable to construct returns with rent. But in the simulated data from our model,
we can calculate returns with rent as well as excess returns and our predictability results do not change much.
See Section V.3 for further disccusions.

DISCOUNT SHOCK, PRICE-RENT DYNAMICS, AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

values of α1 and R2 as well as the corresponding 90% probability intervals. As one can see,
the 90% probability interval of R2 contains the regresson estimate from the actual data at
each horizon. Conversely, the 90% confidence interval of α1 from the actual data contains
the median value of α1 from the simulated data at each horizon. Both α1 and R2 increase
with the forecasting horizon k.10 Overall, the model results are consistent with the data,
especially for the model’s ability to predict long-horizon real estate returns by the price-rent
ratio.
The samples generated by other shocks in our model do not have such a predictive power.
Table 4 reports the regression results from the samples simulated by growth technology
shocks. At each horizon (k = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24), the median estimate of α1 is negative and
outside the 90% probability interval implied by the actual data. The median values of R2
are all less than 0.05 and their 90% probability intervals implied by the simulated data do
not contain the value of R2 calculated from the actual data except for the short horizon
of 8 quarters. Thus, the samples generated by technology shocks do not have a power in
predicting future real estate returns.11 The failure to predict applies to the samples generated
by other shocks as well. A comparison of Tables 3 and 4 indicates clearly the essential role
of discount-rate shocks in predicting the long-horizon returns of real estate by price-rent
variation.
IV.2. Empirical results of volatility. Using the same samples simulated with discountrate shocks as in the preceding section, one can compute the volatilities of investment,
consumption, output, rental price, real estate price, and price-rent ratio. Table 5 reports
these volatilities for the simulated data against the actual data. For the model-simulated
data, the table reports the median values of volatilities with 90% probability intervals (the
last three columns). Judging by the median values, one can see that although discount-rate
shocks account for only 11% of the observed volatility for consumption and 7% for rent, these
shocks explain 48% of the observed volatility for investment, 25% for output, 94% for real
estate price, and 100% for price-rent ratio. The volatility of discount-rate shocks is by itself
diminutive, with the median value of 0.00067. Through the model’s propagation mechanism
discussed in Section III.3, however, these shocks are capable of generating the dynamic data
that link the volatilities in the financial sector to those in the production sector.12
10In

Section V we use a simplified version of our general equilibrium model to obtain a closed-form solution

to the first-order approximation. This solution enables us to provide a formal proof of this empirical result.

magnitude similar to the volatility of the discount rate. Indeed, its median estimate is 0.0005 with the tight
90% probability interval [0.00046, 0.0006]. The relatively small fluctuation of Rf is the reason why our model
is capable of generating the long-horizon predictability of excess returns, as discussed in Section V.3.

In the counterfactual economy with no financial frictions, by contrast, discount-rate shocks
can explain only 63% of price-rent variation or the volatility of real estate price as shown in
Table 6. To see how financial frictions play such an important role in the real estate sector,
we establish the following proposition by log-linearizing equation (13).
Proposition 3. Define η =

a∗ f (a∗ )
.
1−F (a∗ )

Under a suitable normalization of distribution f , the real

estate price can be decomposed into three components:
p̂t = p̂1t + p̂2t + p̂3t ,
where

Proof. The decomposition uses a log-linearized method similar to the Campbell and Shiller
(1988) decomposition. The detailed proof is provided in Appendix D.3.



The first component p̂1t is the contribution from the stochastic discount factor, which is
mainly driven by discount-rate variation. The second component p̂2t reflects the contribution
from rent. The third component p̂3t represents the contribution from the collateral premium.
Using the simulated data with discount-rate shocks alone, we calculate std(p̂t ) = 12.91%,
std(p̂1t ) = 8.20%, std(p̂2t ) = 0.34%, and std(p̂3t ) = 4.40%, where std stands for standard
deviation. In this case,
std(p̂t ) ≈ std(p̂1t ) + std(p̂2t ) + std(p̂3t ).
The estimated volatility contribution from the collateral premium is about one third:13
std(p̂3t )

std(p̂t )
12.91
This estimation result reveals that the collateral premium is an important force in driving the
fluctuation of real estate price. The absence of the contribution from the collateral premium,
therefore, is the main reason for the only 63% explanation of the volatility in the real estate
sector as reported in Table 6 for the counterfactual economy without financial frictions.
13We

perform a similar exercise for the growth rate of real estate price from our simulated data. The

corresponding volatilities are std(∆p̂t ) = 3.9%, std(∆p̂1t ) = 2.46%, std(∆p̂2t ) = 0.10%, and std(∆p̂3t ) =
1.36%. Thus, the volatility contribution from the collateral premium is also about one third:

V. Understanding amplification and predictability
To understand how discount-rate and technology shocks play disparate roles in predicting
real estate returns and in amplifying the fluctuations of real estate variables relative to the
volatility of output, we simplify our model by fixing the supply of labor at Nt = 1 and
removing investment from the original model. This simplification enables us to solve for
a closed-form solution to the log-linearized model and thus gain insight into the empirical
results we have obtained in this paper.
V.1. The simplified model. In the simplified stationary model we focus on two exogenous
shocks: the technology shock At and the discount-rate shock θt . The household maximizes

as in the original model. With this simplification, we have the following closed-form results.

V.2. Theoretical results of volatility. The volatility derivation follows directly from
Proposition 4. For the data generated by technology shocks, we have
std(p̂t )
std(R̂ct )

= 1,

std(p̂t − R̂ct )
std(Ŷt )

= 0.

DISCOUNT SHOCK, PRICE-RENT DYNAMICS, AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

17

The real estate price and the rental price fluctuate in the same magnitude so that technology
shocks are unable to produce price-rent variation. For the time series generated by discountrate shocks, by contrast, we have
std(p̂t )
std(R̂ct )

= 1 + η,

std(p̂t − R̂ct )
std(Ŷt )

= η.

Clearly, the real estate price is always more volatile than the rental price and as long as
η > 1, which is the case in our estimation, the price-rent ratio is more volatile than output.
The intuition is that, unlike technology shocks, discount-rate shocks are intertemporal shocks
that do not influence the current rent or output directly. They have a smaller indirect effect
on rent through endogenous TFP as revealed by the term â∗t , but a larger effect on the future
appreciation of real estate price.
V.3. Theoretical results of predictability. To gain economic intuition behind our empirical predictability results, we begin with the standard asset pricing equation
Et Mt+1 Rit+1 = 1,
where Rit+1 denotes the one-period return of any asset i and the pricing kernel, denoted by
Mt+1 , is

θt+1 βu0 (Ct+1 )
.
u0 (Ct )
Because the asset pricing equation also holds for the risk-free interest rate
Mt+1 =

Rf t Et Mt+1 = 1,

(20)

the log-linearized solution leads to
Et R̂it+1 − R̂f t = 0.
For standard models, therefore, there is no equity premium and hence no predictability.14
The asset pricing equation in our model is different as it involves the collateral premium
for the first-order solution. For the risk-free interest rate, equation (20) continues to hold.
But for the real estate return, we rewrite the asset pricing equation represented by (13) as

+ Lt+1 = 1,
(21)
re
where Rt+1
denotes the real estate return

taking into account second-order Jensen term, Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2016)

show that the equity premium remains constant in their baseline model even when the valuation ratio
fluctuates with discount-rate shocks. This result implies no predictability for excess returns. The reason is
simple: discount-rate shocks drive returns and risk-free rates in the same magnitude and hence cancel out
both terms.

One can see from Proposition 4 that θ̂t+1 has a direct impact on a∗t+1 and hence on L̂t+1 .
Since the stochastic process for θ̂t is very persistent, the discount-rate shock θ̂t moves the
excess return of real estate directly by influencing both Rf t and Et L̂t+1 . While this result is
intuitive, it is challenging to turn this intuition into the theoretical result of predictability.

Specifically, if one runs the OLS regression of excess return R̂t+k

v̂t ≡ R̂ct − p̂t , is the coefficient of the valuation ratio positive? For our model, the answer is

values and run the OLS regression of R̂t+k
− R̂f t on the valuation ratio v̂t ≡ R̂ct − p̂t for

different horizons k. The results have a pattern remarkably similar to what is reported in
Table 3 (thus, not reported to save the space). Since the rent and price time series in actual
data are available only in terms of index, the real estate return is often computed without
rent in the real estate literature (Ghysels, Plazzi, Torous, and Valkanov, 2013). For the
theoretical underpinning of the empirical results pertaining to the real estate return without
rent as reported in Table 3, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 6. Denote the k-period return of real estate (without rent) by r̂t+k ≡ p̂t+k − p̂t .
For the time series generated by discount-rate shocks, the following two results hold:

For the time series generated by technology shocks, however, α1 ≡ E [r̂t+k | v̂t ] = 0.



According to Proposition 6, there is no predictability of real estate returns from the time
series driven by technology shocks. For discount-rate shocks, the opposite is true. The
regression coefficient α1 increases with the forecast horizon but is always less than one; the
fit measure R2 increases with the forecast horizon to around 0.5 for long forecast horizons.
These closed-form results are in line with our empirical results obtained from the more
realistic benchmark model (Table 3).
In summary, the simplified model illustrates the special role played by discount-rate shocks
in generating the data dynamics that feature the two distinct asset pricing properties observed in actual data: predictability and volatility. To be sure, the simplified model excludes
investment and is incapable of explaining the relationship between price-rent variation and
the business cycle (fact (3) discussed in the introduction). But the insight gained from
the closed-form results provides a theoretical explanation of the empirical results we have
obtained in this paper.
VI. Conclusion
We argue to imbed households’ discount-rate shocks and firms’ collateral constraints in
the dynamic general equilibrium framework. This addition keeps the model tractable to be
estimated and at the same time substantially improves the model’s performance in accounting
for (i) the large volatility of price-rent ratio relative to investment and output, (ii) the longhorizon predictability of real estate returns, and (iii) the dynamic relationship between pricerent variations and the business cycle. For dynamic general equilibrium models, the longhorizon predictability has proven difficult to obtain. We find that the collateral premium is
the most important factor in generating the predictability result as well as the comovements
among financial and economic variables. Fluctuations of discount-rate shocks are extremely
small in magnitude but the model’s internal propagation mechanism translates these small
shocks into the large volatilities of price-rent ratio, investment, and output.
Because the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by the collapse of real estate prices and
the sharp fall of investment, this paper focuses on commercial real estate and its relation
to investment and inevitably abstracts from other dimensions that merit further study in
the future. One such dimension is to include mortgage markets for households. Another
dimension is to extend the model to explain asset pricing facts in the stock market. We hope
that the mechanism and insight developed in this paper lays the groundwork for extending
the model along these and other important dimensions.

Appendix A. Data
All the quarterly time series used in this paper were constructed by Patrick Higgins at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, some of which were collected directly from the Haver
Analytics Database (Haver for short). In this section, we describe the details of data construction.
The model estimation is based on six U.S. aggregate time series: the real price of comData
mercial real estate (pData
), the real rental price (Rct
), the quality-adjusted relative price
t

of investment ((1/Zt )Data ), real per capita consumption (CtData ), real per capita investment
(ItData ), and per capita total hours (HtData ). All variables except hours and relative price
of investment are deflated by the price of nondurable consumption goods and non-housing
services.
These series are constructed as follows:

Sources for the constructed data, along with the Haver keys (all capitalized letters) to the
data, are described below.
pCommRE: Commercial real-estate price index. The construction of this series is based on
the series named as “FL075035503” from the Flow of Funds Accounts database provided by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.15 Note that the price
index through 1996Q1 is not based on repeated sales but instead relies on a weightedaverage of three appraisal-based commercial property price series (per square foot):
retail property, office property, and warehouse/industrial property. These series come
from National Real Estate Investor (NREI). The weights applied to the NREI are not
revised and are calculated using annual data from the Survey of Current Business.
From 1996Q2 on, the commercial property price index is the Costar Commercial
Repeat Sales Index published by “National Real Estate Investor.”
TortoTotalRent: Rental price index for commercial real estate. Tornqvist aggregate of
Torto Wheaton Research Index for rental prices of retail properties, Torto Wheaton
Research Index for rental prices of office properties (commercial excluding retail), and

the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ website http://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/

Torto Wheaton Research Index for rental prices of industrial properties. Detailed
description of the series is available at http://www.cohenasset.com/pdfs/
Torto%20Wheaton%20Research%20Methodology.pdf. The data, downloaded
from the CBRE Econometrics Advisors website, were constructed by the Torto
Wheaton Research (TWR) hedonic approach (Wheaton and Torto, 1994) and (Malpezzi,
2002, Chapter 5).
PriceNonDurPlusServExHous: Consumer price index. Price deflator of non-durable
consumption and non-housing services, constructed by Tornqvist aggregation of price
deflator of non-durable consumption and non-housing related services (2009=100).
GordonPriceCDplusES: Price of investment goods. Quality-adjusted price index for consumer durable goods, equipment investment, and intellectual property products investment. This is a weighted index from a number of individual price series within
this category. For each individual price series from 1947 to 1983, we use Gordon
(1990)’s quality-adjusted price index. Following Cummins and Violante (2002), we
estimate an econometric model of Gordon’s price series as a function of time trend
and several macroeconomic indicators in the National Income and Product Account
(NIPA), including the current and lagged values of the corresponding NIPA price
series. The estimated coefficients are then used to extrapolate the quality-adjusted
price index for each individual price series for the sample from 1984 to 2008. These
constructed price series are annual. We use Denton (1971)’s method to interpolate
these annual series at quarterly frequency. We then use the Tornqvist procedure to
construct the quality-adjusted price index from the interpolated individual quarterly
price series.
NomConsNHSplusND: Nominal personal consumption expenditures. Nominal nondurable
goods and non-housing services (SAAR, billion of dollars). It is computed as CNX USNA
+ CSX USNA - CSRUX USNA, where CNX USNA is nominal non-durable goods
consumption (SAAR, million of dollars), CSX USNA is nominal service consumption (SAAR, million of dollars), and CSRUX USNA is nominal housing and utilities
consumption (SAAR, million of dollars).
POPSMOOTH USECON: Population. Smoothed civilian noninstitutional population
with ages 16 years and over (thousands). This series is smoothed by eliminating
breaks in population from 10-year censuses and post-2000 American Community
Surveys using the “error of closure” method. This fairly simple method is used by
the Census Bureau to get a smooth monthly population series and reduce the unusual
influence of drastic demographic changes.16

methodology/intercensal_nat_meth.html.

CDX USNA: Consumer durable goods expenditures. Nominal personal consumption expenditures: durable goods (SAAR, million of dollars).
nominveqipp: Nominal equipment and intellectual property products investment (SAAR,
million of dollars).
AggHours: Total hours in the non-farm business (NFB) sector. It is calculated as (Average
hours per workers in NFB sector) times (Total civilian employment from Household
Survey). The series is normalized to one at 1948Q1.

Appendix B. Estimation procedure
We apply the Bayesian methodology to the estimation of the log-linearized medium-scale
structural model, using our own C/C++ code. The advantage of using our own code instead
of using Dynare is the flexibility and accuracy we have for finding the posterior mode. We
generate over a half million draws from the prior as a starting point for our optimization routine and select the estimated parameters that give the highest posterior probability density.
The optimization routine is a combination of NPSOL software package and the csminwel
routine provided by Christopher A. Sims.
In estimation, we use the log-linearized equilibrium conditions, reported in Appendix E, to
form the posterior probability function fit to the six quarterly U.S. time series from 1995Q2 to
2017Q2: the price-rent ratio in commercial real estate, the quality-adjusted relative price of
investment, real per capita consumption, real per capita investment (in consumption units),
and per capita hours worked. Excluding the four lags, the sample for estimation begins with
1996Q2 when the repeated-sales price of commercial real estate became available.
We fix the values of certain parameters as an effective way to sharpen the identification of
some key parameters in the model. The capital share α(1 − φ) is set at 0.33, consistent with
the average capital income share. The share of land in production is estimated at φ = 0.07 by
solving the steady state (see Appendix G). The growth rate of aggregate investment-specific
technology, gz = 1.01, is consistent with the average growth rate of the inverse relative price
of investment goods. The growth rate of aggregate output, gγ = 1.003, is consistent with the
average common growth rate of consumption and investment. The interest rate Rf is set at
1.01. The steady state capacity utilization u is set at 1. The steady-state labor supply as
a fraction of the total time is normalized at N = 0.3. To solve the steady state, we impose
three additional restrictions to be consistent with the data: 1) the capital-output ratio is
1.125 at annual frequency; 2) the investment-capital ratio is 0.22 at annual frequency; and
3) the rental-income-to-output ratio is 0.1.17
17The

output data used in our model is a sum of personal consumption expenditures and private do-

mestic investment. Consumption is the private expenditures on nondurable goods and nonhousing services.

DISCOUNT SHOCK, PRICE-RENT DYNAMICS, AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

We estimate five structural parameters as well as all the persistence and volatility parameters that govern exogenous shock processes. The five structural parameters are the inverse
Frisch elasticity of labor supply ν, the collateral elasticity χ, the elasticity of capacity utilization δ 00 (1)/δ 0 (1), the habit formation γ, and the investment-adjustment cost Ω. The
remaining parameters are then obtained from the steady state relationships that satisfy the
aforementioned data ratio restrictions. These parameters are: the capital depreciation rate
(δ = 0.0437), the subjective discount factor (β = 0.993), the collateral elasticity (χ = 0.045),
the capacity utilization rate (δ 0 (1) = 0.0638), and the labor disutility (ψ = 4.027).
For the estimated parameters, we specify a prior that covers a wide range of values that are
economically plausible (Table 7). The prior for ν, χ, γ, or Ω has a distribution with the shape
hyperparameter a = 1. This hyperparameter value is specified to allow a positive probability
density at the zero value. The implied 90% prior probability bounds are consistent with the
values considered in the literature. The prior distribution for δ 00 (1)/δ 0 (1) is designed to cover
the range consistent with Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009).
The prior for the persistence parameters of exogenous shock processes follows the beta
distribution with the 90% probability interval between 0.01 and 0.45. Such a prior favors
stationarity. The prior for the standard deviations of shock processes follows the inverse
gamma distribution with the 90% probability interval between 0.0001 and 2.0. The standard
deviation prior specification is far more diffuse than what is used in the literature.

economic meaning. Log-linearizing the endogenous TFP

Investment is the private expenditures on consumer durable goods and fixed investment in equipment and intellectual property. Accordingly, we measure capital stock using the annual stocks of equipment, intellectual
products, and consumer durable goods.

The first order condition for intermediate goods producers’ optimal problem with respect
to real estate gives
αφPXt (j)At Kt (j)α(1−φ) Nt (j)(1−α) Htαφ−1 (j) = Rct .
Given the symmetric equilibrium in the intermediate goods sector and the market clear
conditions, the previous equation becomes
Rct = αφa∗t At (ut Kt )α(1−φ) Htαφ−1 Nt1−α .

Since the collateral constraint (8) binds for firms with ait ≥ a∗t , aggregating this constraint

Since PXt = a∗t and Xt = At Nt1−α = At , we have
PXt Xt = [1 − F (a∗t )]λpt = a∗t At .

The predictability result for real estate returns, as shown above, also holds for excess
returns. One can see from equations (17) and (18) that the risk-free interest rate in response

Note that ρθ − ρkθ ≥ 0. As long as η is sufficiently large, the term in the square brackets
is positive, which is true for our estimated parameters. Hence if we run a regression of the
excess return on the log value of the rent-price ratio R̂ct − p̂t , the coefficient will be positive.

equilibrium condition:

With technology shocks, however, the log value of the rent-price ratio is v̂t = R̂ct − p̂t = 0.
Clearly, there is no predictability for technology shocks.
