Can a Summer Make a Difference? The Impact of the American Economic Association Summer
Program on Minority Student Outcomes

NBER Working Paper No. 20407

JEL No. I21,I24,J15
ABSTRACT
In the 1970s, the American Economic Association (AEA) was one of several professional associations
to launch a summer program with the goal of increasing racial and ethnic diversity in its profession.
In this paper we estimate the effectiveness of the AEA’s program which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first to rigorously study such a summer program. Using a comparison group consisting of those
who applied to, but did not attend, the program and controlling for an array of background characteristics,
we find that program participants were over 40 percentage points more likely to apply to and attend
a PhD program in economics, 26 percentage points more likely to complete a PhD, and about 15 percentage
points more likely to ever work in an economics-related academic job. Using our estimates, we calculate
that the program may directly account for 17-21 percent of the PhDs awarded to minorities in economics
over the past 20 years.

Introduction
Underrepresentation of minorities in higher education has been the focus of

sustained attention in the U.S. for decades.

Lack of preparation, information, and

resources as well as residual discrimination have been identified as potential reasons for
this underrepresentation, prompting policymakers and educators to adopt counteracting
strategies such as affirmative action in admissions, scholarships, and enrichment
programs. Perhaps the most controversial of these programs is affirmative action in
admissions. Studies examining the impact of affirmative action bans generally find that
these bans decrease the likelihood that minority students apply to and enroll in top-tier
institutions (e.g., Long, 2004; Dickson, 2006; Backes, 2012; Hinrichs, 2012). Similarly,
interventions in the spirit of affirmative action, such as quotas and preferential treatment
in laboratory designs, suggest that this approach is effective at increasing gender and
racial diversity (e.g., Balafoutas and Sutter, 2012; Niederle, Segal, and Vesterlund, 2013;
Schotter and Weigelt, 1992).

1

However, given political and legal controversies

surrounding affirmative action, many have turned to other strategies for increasing the
representativeness of minority students in institutions of higher education.
Providing enrichment for students so that they are better prepared for further
academic study is a well-established, though little-researched approach, to increasing
academic diversity. For example, for the past fifty years the federal government has
funded college preparatory programs, such as Upward Bound and Talent Search. While
the research base for these programs is relatively thin, the estimated impacts on student
educational outcomes (such as college attendance or the type of institution attended) have
1

In addition, several theoretical studies have examined the implications of affirmative action for college
admission, future earnings, and wage inequality (see, e.g., Chan and Eyster, 2003; Moro and Norman,
2003; Arcidiacono, 2005).

2

been surprisingly mixed (see, e.g., Haskins and Rouse 2013). There is even less evidence
on the effectiveness of enrichment programs to prepare students for graduate programs
with the aim of addressing underrepresentation in specific professions, although such
programs exist in several fields. For example, the American Economic Association
(AEA), American Political Science Association (APSA), and the Public Policy and
International Affairs Program (PPIA) have sponsored summer enrichment programs for
the past 30 or more years.2,3
It is straightforward to understand why the AEA elected to focus on increasing
diversity in its profession: in the late-1970s only 3 to 5 percent of doctorates in
economics received by US citizens and permanent residents were awarded to minorities
traditionally underrepresented in the profession (African Americans, Hispanics, and
Native Americans), or about 23 new PhDs, each year (Collins 2000). This lack of
diversity was worrisome because economic analysis is likely to benefit from differing
perspectives and priorities among those in the profession; in addition, a lack of role
models in institutions of higher education may have been discouraging younger

2

Other professions offer slightly different kinds of programs with the shared goal of increasing diversity.
For instance, the American Sociological Association runs the Minority Fellowship Program that provides
mentoring and financial support to minority applicants to graduate programs and current PhD students. As
another example, the Minority Legal Education Resources operates the Bar Process Management Program
to assist minorities in passing the Illinois Bar Exam and provide them professional advice.
3
Around the time that efforts were starting to increase racial and ethnic diversity in many professions, there
were also efforts to increase representation of women. For example, the American Economic Association
started focusing efforts on increasing the proportion of women in economics in the 1970s. Since then, the
percentage of women receiving doctorates in economics has increased from 11 percent in 1975 to 35
percent in 2011, a trend that can be attributed to a variety of factors, including programs designed to
address the imbalance (American Economic Association, 1976; McElroy, 2013; Kahn, 1995; Ginther and
Kahn, 2004; Hale and Regev, 2013). Notably, Blau, et al. (2010) report findings from the first randomized
study of the AEA’s mentoring program for junior female economists. They find that the mentoring
program had a positive effect on a number of professional outcomes, such as the number of top-tier
publications, the total number of publications, and the number of successful federal grants earned by
individuals randomly assigned a mentor compared to those randomly assigned to the control group.

3

generations of minority students from entering the profession (Collins 2000; Chung 2000)
and may have adversely affected minority students’ performance (Fairlie et al., 2014).
Unfortunately, after some initial improvement, progress has stalled more recently.
As shown in Figure 1, the percentage of economics PhDs awarded to minorities has
fluctuated around 8 percent since the mid-1990s, which means on average about 30 new
PhDs each year.4 As a sobering contrast, the percentage of minorities receiving doctorates
has experienced a steady increase in other social sciences and in the science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.
Given the lack of significant improvement in the racial and ethnic
representativeness of doctorates in economics, a key question is whether the AEA’s
Summer Program has been effective at improving the diversity of the economics
profession. To address this question and evaluate the success of the program, we use data
from over one-third of AEASP participants between its inception in 1974 and 2010, and a
comparison group of students who applied to the program but did not attend. While not a
randomized control group, the comparison group enables us to assess the program’s
impact on a variety of graduate school and professional outcomes. Although we control
for a variety of background characteristics, we note that there may be residual unobserved
differences between the AEASP participants and those in the comparison group that bias
the estimated impacts. That said, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation
that uses a comparison group to assess an (summer) enrichment program that focuses on
disadvantaged and minority groups.5

4
Similarly, the percentage of bachelor’s degrees in economics awarded to minorities has remained around
10-12 percent since 1995 (Rouse 2013).
5
In a related paper, Price (2005) examines the research productivity of Black American economists, and
alternately using propensity score matching (on observables) and Heckman corrections (to control for

4

Overall, we find that the AEA’s Summer Program participants were over 40
percentage points more likely to apply to and attend a PhD program in economics, 26
percentage points more likely to complete a PhD, and about 15 percentage points more
likely to ever work in an economics-related academic job. Using these estimates, we
calculate that the program may directly account for 17-21 percent of the minority PhDs in
economics over the past 20 years. As such, the results from this analysis suggest that
relatively intensive, but short, enrichment programs can be an effective tool for
improving diversity in at least economics, and likely other professions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the
AEA Summer Program and its student population. In section III we present the data,
including our survey and its implementation and the estimation strategy. We present the
results in section IV. Section V concludes.

II.

Background on the American Economic Association Summer Program
The Program
With the stated objective of increasing the numbers of professional economists

from underrepresented minority groups who have been historically disadvantaged in the
American context, the AEA Summer Program began regular operation at the University
of California, Berkeley in 1974.6 Laudably, the program completed its 39th session in

unobserved selection), finds that conditional on being an economist, AEASP participants were somewhat
more likely to have published in major journals, received support from the National Science Foundation,
and to have NBER membership than those who did not attend.
6
Initially, “underrepresented in the American context” largely meant African American and Native
American. Since about the mid-1970s this has broadened to include Hispanics, Filipino-Americans, Pacific
Islanders, and others. Scholarship support was generally, but not always, restricted to these groups,
although a small number of non-minority participants also have received financial aid. There have also
been a very small number of foreign, non-permanent resident participants; to our knowledge, these students
did not receive scholarship support unless they had refugee status. The presence of non-minority students

5

2013.7 Table 1 shows the universities that have hosted the program since its inception,
the years of operation, and the annual average number of participants at each institution.8
Since the beginning, the AEASP has included just fewer than 1,000 participants, or about
25 per year; hosts have run the program for an average of 3.7 years.
The program itself has varied over time. One reason for the variation is the
resources of the host institution and external funding support. As a result, while the
typical program has been 7-8 weeks long, it has ranged from as few as 5 weeks at the
University of New Mexico (UNM) to 9 weeks at Duke. Further, while on average about
25 students have participated each year (see Table 1), participant numbers have ranged
from fewer than 20 at University of Texas, Austin (Texas) to over 30 at Duke. Another
reason for the variation has been the director’s interpretation of the objective of the
program.

Some directors, especially those earlier on, have aimed to increase the

likelihood that students already interested in economics and from relatively competitive
undergraduate institutions could enroll in and successfully complete a graduate program
in an academically rigorous (think “Top 10”) department. Others have focused on “high
value added” students who were also interested in economics but who may have been
from a less competitive undergraduate institution, who may have not thought seriously of
pursuing a career in economics that requires training beyond the bachelor’s level, or who
may have had lower grades. Leeds (1992) articulated this issue slightly differently in
noting that students whose parents were professionals earned substantially higher grades
was driven by legal rulings and university policy, but at no institution were the numbers of non-minority
students large.

See Alexis (1975) for a description of the history and first year of the AEASP, and see Collins (2000) for
an earlier discussion of the AEA’s efforts to increase the representation of minorities in the economics
profession.

The program has operated nearly continuously since its inception. The only year the program did not
operate was in 2011 as it transitioned from the University of California at Santa Barbara to the University
of New Mexico.

6

in their undergraduate programs. As a result, directors faced a trade-off between those
applicants with the greatest need (and who presumably were least likely to progress on
their own) and those applicants most likely to do well (and more likely to progress to
doctoral programs on their own). Although the outcomes of interest (e.g., success in a
doctoral program and a career in an economics-related profession) are similar, the focus
would have affected several decisions of the program directors, such as recruitment and
curriculum. While potentially important for the evaluation, as with other aspects of the
program that varied, because of small sample size we do not attempt to estimate
differential treatment effects by specific program characteristics.
In terms of curriculum, at the outset the program offered what amounted to study
of advanced intermediate undergraduate material and an introduction to mathematical
economics using Alpha Chiang’s classic text (Alexis, 1975).

Over the years,

econometrics and research components were added; since time constraints were binding,
something – usually macroeconomics – had to give. In more recent years, advanced
coursework at various hosts has included real analysis, probability and mathematical
statistics, time series econometrics, and research seminars that focused on micro data
analysis.9 At some hosts, the content has been delivered in formal course structures that
met university requirements and received academic credit; elsewhere, this was not the
case. At the University of Colorado, Denver (UC-Denver) and Duke, an average of
roughly 6 participants per year returned for a second summer.10 Elsewhere, students took

9

Grove et al. (2007), Grove and Wu (2007), and Krueger and Wu (2000) find that better math and
economics preparation are related to success in graduate programs in economics, suggesting that these
elements of the Summer Program should result in improved outcomes for participants.
10
We treat AEASP recipients as having been exposed to a single treatment regardless of whether they
attended for one or two summers. Descriptive statistics also do not count students who return for a second
summer. The impact of the second summer may well be important (as detailed in Becker and Price, 2008),

7

a single program regardless of background level. Even excluding from consideration
those hosts that provided two levels, it is safe to say that the content has varied
substantially from one host to another.
In terms of cost, it was recognized from the outset that most students needed to
earn money during the summer to cover living and tuition costs in the coming academic
year; moreover, given the caliber of the students attracted, many if not the majority had
competing paid internship opportunities. Thus, the Summer Program generally has paid
student living and travel costs, books and software costs, and also has provided a modest
stipend, which in recent years has been in the $2000 to $2500 range.11
In addition to student costs and stipends, the program also recruited faculty and
teaching assistants. In most years, the program has had a faculty member who served as
the director, along with a staff assistant. Some of the faculty and teaching assistants
came from the host institution; those who did not were provided transportation and
housing. Most faculty and all teaching assistants, regardless of institution, were paid for
their work effort. These costs were covered by support from the AEA, public and private
foundation grants, university (generally in-kind) contributions, and sponsor in-kind

but the recency and number of second-year participants make it difficult to assess the impact on PhD
completion and career outcomes with any reliability.
11
The stated intent of the AEASP has been to increase minority representation in the economics profession
and to our knowledge, all students prior to 1996 received scholarship support. However, starting with the
Texas program, the Hopwood v. Texas court ruling that forbade explicit consideration of race in admission
or other academic decisions caused the formal distinguishing of admission and financial aid decisions, and
also led to the admission of non-minority students. Since Texas offered credit for the summer program
courses, resident economics majors also were allowed to register for the courses and to participate in the
AEASP. Local students were awarded a tuition scholarship from Department of Economics funds and
included both minority and non-minority scholars. While the Hopwood ruling was later significantly
relaxed, the successor institutions no longer excluded non-minority students. Host institutions UCD and
Duke also offered course credit, and allowed regular students to take Summer Program courses. These
hosts also gave a small number of non-minority students need-based financial aid. Note that in our analysis
non-AEA Summer Program students from the host institution who were enrolled in the courses are not
regarded as AEASP students.

8

contributions. 12 Institutional in-kind support included (at some, but not all, hosts)
classroom and other space, telephones, computer labs, and dormitories. Some hosts also
have opened the courses to other students and transferred tuition revenue to the program.
Examples of sponsor in-kind support include Coors Brewing Company’s hosting of the
2002 and 2003 graduation ceremonies, or the Federal Reserve Board of Governor’s
sponsoring of a Fed-based faculty member for the four years that the program was at
Duke.
Program costs have varied through the years, in part because input costs changed
over time and location, in part because input quantities varied markedly and in part
because hosts or supporters provided varying amounts of unrecorded in-kind support.
Faculty salaries also varied, both because cost structures differ across institutions, and
because some schools treated instruction as regular teaching credit, while others paid
summer school rates or hired visitors. Above all, inputs varied. At UCD and Duke, costs
were higher because some participants returned for a second summer. Administrative
commitments also increased (generally to 0.5 of an academic year full-time equivalent
for the director) and at Duke, UC-Santa Barbara, and New Mexico there was extensive
use of recent alumni as teaching assistants and mentors. Overall, based on budget reports
submitted to the AEA to which we have access, costs ranged from $576,634
($22,178/participant) in 2003 to $776,676 ($25,889/participant) in 2006. In contrast, the
budget for the first AEASP program was well under $300,000 (and under
$12,500/participant; Alexis, 1975).13

12

The program has received support from the National Science Foundation and private foundations, such as
the Ford, Mellon, and MacArthur Foundations.

All costs are converted to 2013 dollars using CPI-U.

Applicants
We do not have complete records on applicants, but based on what we have, it
appears that the size of the applicant pool has varied from about 50-75 at Texas to 150 at
the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Applicant pool size has varied with economic
climate, host institution effort and prestige, and the program’s geographic accessibility.14
Program directors had little reason to generate a large pool of highly-qualified applicants
only to reject most of them. As such, the incentive was to ensure there was a large and
diverse pool yielding 50-75 “quality” applicants, and not much of an impetus to go
beyond that (and, in any event, recruiting budgets were tight). In short, the program’s
applicant pool was not large but was highly competitive and in a typical year there would
have been at least two or more admissible applicants for each offer made. Further,
acceptance rates tended to be high. For example, at Duke and UCD, about 90 percent of
those admitted accepted the offer and attended. We have no reason to believe that the
percentages elsewhere were different. As a result, few alternates were extended offers.
Overall, program size was constrained by funding and host administrative capacity rather
than by the size of the applicant pool.

Participants
The composition of the minority student body also changed from one program to
another. Reflecting the two potential targets of the program discussed earlier, some
schools, such as Temple (Leeds, 1992) and UCD, targeted students from less elite schools

14

The pool often declined during periods of high employment and economic growth. Evidence of this
during the years at Temple University is described in Leeds (1992). Data on applicant pools other than
Temple come from personal communication and information provided by program directors at Texas and
Wisconsin.

10

for practical as well as ideological reasons; Duke and Stanford did so to a lesser extent as
a matter of policy.
Consistent gender and race/ethnicity data for all programs do not exist, but the
following points can be made from the (unpublished, but available from the authors) data
that do exist.

In the early years of the AEASP, the student composition was

overwhelmingly African-American. In more recent years, the student bodies have been
more evenly divided between African-American and Hispanic backgrounds, though there
has been substantial oscillation from one year and host to the next. There also have been
small contingents of students (just over 15 percent of our alumni survey respondents)
who were Native American or from other historically underrepresented Asian-American
groups (of Filipino, Pacific Islander, Hmong, or Vietnamese origin). Some students also
have self-identified as multiple racial/ethnic backgrounds.

Finally, throughout the

program’s history, women have comprised slightly less than half of the AEASP student
body, though in some years women were the majority. There is no apparent time trend in
the share of students who are women.

III.

The Survey and Empirical Strategy
The Survey
We started by putting together a sample frame of AEASP participants. We did so

with a list of participants from 1974-2007 that we believe to be complete. These data
included addresses and, for more recent years, virtually complete e-mail addresses.
While e-mail and physical addresses change, informal and some formal (e.g., Facebook

11

pages) contacts remain strong, and ultimately it was possible to contact a very large
majority of participants.
Fortunately, we also had relatively complete records on all applicants from
Stanford, UCD, and Duke with which to construct a comparison group. The advantage of
this comparison group is that it represents a group of students who were motivated to
apply for the AEA Summer Program and therefore are likely relatively comparable to the
participants. At the same time, most of them were not accepted to the program and we
only have such data from a limited number of program years.15
We conducted a web-based survey from October 2010 to March 2011 to 1,464
individuals. We offered $25 as an incentive for participation. In total, 473 individuals
responded (for a response rate of 32 percent): 329 applied to and attended the program,
and 144 applied to but did not attend.16 Of all applicants, 19 percent reported that they
were not admitted and 6 percent reported having declined the offer or not attended for
reasons such as poor health. Figure 2 shows the number of respondents by treatment and
comparison status by the year in which they applied to the program. We had the highest
number of responses from the summer sessions of 1989-96 and 2000-07 though there
were a remarkable 14 respondents from the 1981 class.
The survey asked for background information, such as parental educational
attainment, and about college experiences, any post-graduate studies, and labor market
15

In an attempt to broaden the comparison group, we also asked survey participants to nominate someone
with whom the individual went to college but did not apply to the AEA Summer Program, a form of
“snowball sampling” (Goodman, 1961). While broadening the sample, this group of students is likely more
dissimilar to the participants (on both observable and unobservable characteristics) than those from the
unsuccessful applicant comparison group and, importantly, only increased the overall sample by 3
observations. As a result, we focus the analysis on only the applicant comparison group although results
are similar when we use all available data and are available on request. Unless otherwise mentioned, no
statistics in this paper involve the snowball sample.
16
There were 8 respondents who did not respond to any outcome-related variables; 5 were AEASP alums
and 3 had not attended. We treat them as survey non-respondents.

12

experiences. Specifically, we asked about six educational outcomes including: whether
the respondent had graduated with an economics major, applied to an economics graduate
program, applied to an economics doctoral program, attended an economics graduate
program, attended an economics doctoral program, and completed a doctoral degree in
economics.

We also asked about seven employment-related outcomes: whether the

respondent currently has an economics-related job, has an economics-related job at an
educational or research institution, has an economics-related job in academia, ever has
had an economics-related job, ever has had an economics-related job at an educational or
research institution, ever has had an economics-related job in academia, and current gross
annual salary.

Empirical Strategy
We think of a potential AEA Summer Program participant as choosing future
outcomes as an optimization strategy, subject to constraints on time, financial resources,
ability, alternative options, and behavioral parameters, such as his or her discount rate.
Empirically, we model the impact of participating in the AEA Summer Program on a
variety of “economics-related” outcomes, Y, for individual i as follows:
Yi = α + βAEASPi + XiΘ + νi ,

(1)

where AEASPi is a treatment status indicator for individual i having participated in the
AEA Summer Program, Xi is a vector of baseline characteristics, νi is the error term, and
α, β, and Θ are parameters to be estimated; β represents the average effect on outcome Y
of having participated in the Summer Program. In the tables that follow, we estimate

13

equation (1) using a linear probability model for ease of interpretation; however, we have
also implemented probit models which yield similar results (see Appendix Table 1).
We focus our analysis on three subsamples of our dataset. First, we use the full
sample, which consists of every individual who applied to the AEASP and all of the
available comparison group observations (which we highlight are only from Stanford,
UC-Denver, and Duke University). The second “balanced” sample only consists of data
from the years the program was at Stanford, UC-Denver, and Duke University; thus, the
treatment group also only consists of applicants to those programs. The final sample
further limits this “balanced” sample to individuals who applied to those programs
through 2002 (“pre-2003”) to allow for sufficient time to observe some of the longer-run
outcomes.
The key challenge in this analysis is addressing potential unobserved
heterogeneity between AEASP participants and non-participants.

Table 2 compares

background characteristics between participants and non-participants in different
subsamples. Columns (1) and (2) present the mean of characteristics of the two available
comparison groups: those who applied in all available years to a program at Stanford,
UC-Denver, or Duke in column (1) and those who applied to one of these programs
before 2003 in column (2). Columns (3), (5), and (7) present the mean characteristics of
the treatment groups from our three samples, and columns (4), (6), and (8) show the pvalue of the t-test of the difference in means between treatment and comparison groups.
In each subsample, treatment and comparison groups are fairly similar, although
there are some differences.

That said, we highlight that nearly all differences are

statistically indistinguishable across all of the available observable characteristics using

14

the balanced and pre-2003 balanced samples. Specifically, the AEA Summer Program
participants were less likely to have graduated from a Historically Black College and
University (HBCU) in the full sample and the balanced sample.

In addition, non-

participants are about 5 years younger than participants in the full sample, due to the
inclusion of older alumni in the treatment group. They are also 1.5 years older than
participants in the pre-2003 balanced sample. Despite these individual differences, an
omnibus F-test only suggests that overall the treatment and comparison groups are
different when using the full sample where the p-value was 0. The p-value on the
omnibus F-test was 0.57 for the balanced sample and 0.42 for the pre-2003 balanced
sample, suggesting that the treatment and comparison groups are statistically similar in
these two samples.

Nevertheless, we control for observable characteristics in the

subsequent analyses.
Due to a low survey response rate (32 percent), we also attempt to explore
whether survey respondents were different from non-respondents. Ideally, we would
have liked to have regressed a survey response dummy on a series of baseline
characteristics, such as those reported in Table 2 using the survey sample. Unfortunately,
the only characteristic that we observe for the entire survey sample is whether the
individual was female. Across all three subsamples, the coefficient on female is nearly
zero and statistically insignificant, which suggests that it is not systematically associated
with the survey response decision.17 Even more importantly, the impact of whether the
individual was female on the decision to respond is not statistically different between the
treatment and comparison groups. Appendix Table 2 reports the regression results in

17

As mentioned in footnote 16, we treat the 8 respondents who did not respond to any outcome variables as
survey non-respondents. Treating them as respondents does not change any of the results in this exercise.

15

detail.18 While admittedly a limited exercise, the estimates suggest that the estimates of
the impact of the AEASP on subsequent outcomes are not affected by differential survey
response bias.

IV.

Results
Table 3 presents the main results of the impact of the AEASP on “economics-

related” outcomes. In columns (1)-(3) we present results using the full sample, columns
(4)-(6) show results using the “balanced” sample using data from Stanford, the UCDenver, and Duke, and columns (7)-(9) show results using the subset of data from the
balanced sample through 2002 (“pre-2003”). Further, we show estimates of the “raw”
impact of the AEA Summer Program on these outcomes as well as estimates conditional
on a variety of background characteristics. Specifically, we control for a quadratic in the
individual’s age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of undergraduate institutions attended,
whether she or he received a bachelor’s degree from an HBCU, whether she or he
received a bachelor’s degree from an “elite” institution, and whether at least one parent
has a graduate degree. 19 Estimated coefficients from the full set of covariates are
presented in Appendix Table 3.

Impacts on Education Outcomes
18

We also obtained AEA membership status as of June 2014 for the entire survey sample and regressed a
survey response dummy on AEA membership. Different from gender, current AEA membership status is
not a baseline characteristic. Again, we found no statistically significant difference in the coefficent
between treatment and comparison groups. Because AEA membership changes over time and thus may be
correlated with other time-varying characteristics such as age, we do not report the results here although
they are available upon request.
19
We control for the age of the respondent as a quadratic in the results shown here. In unreported
regressions we have included up to a quartic in age and also limited the sample to those born after 1965.
Both strategies generated results similar to those presented here and are available from the authors on

The first panel of Table 3 presents the impact of the AEA Summer Program on
education outcomes such as the likelihood that an individual majors in economics
(defined as economics, agricultural economics, and business/applied economics) or
applies to, enrolls in, or completes a graduate program. Starting with the impact on
interest in economics at the undergraduate level, we find across the samples that AEASP
participants were about 10 percentage points more likely to graduate with a major in
economics (broadly defined) although this impact is not statistically significant in the pre2003 balanced sample.
Further, we observe that AEA Summer Program participants were significantly
more likely to apply to and attend graduate programs in economics. Specifically, AEA
Summer Program participants were nearly 30 percentage points more likely to have
applied to and attended a graduate program in economics and over 40 percentage points
more likely to have applied to and attended a doctoral program in economics relative to
the comparison group. Further, program participants appear to have been about 26
percentage points more likely to complete a PhD in economics relative to the comparison
group in the most restrictive sample – those who applied before 2002 and who have had
the greatest amount of time to complete one (see column (9)). Note that while the point
estimates vary, the estimated impact of an over 200 percent increase in the likelihood of
completing a doctorate in economics (relative to the comparison group mean) holds
across the samples, and with and without available covariates.

Impacts on Labor Market Outcomes

17

The bottom panel of Table 3 presents estimates of the AEA Summer Program on
longer-run “economics-related” career outcomes, such as currently having an economicsrelated job or an economics-related academic job, or ever having held a job related to
economics. In general, 45 percent of those who applied to the AEA Summer Program
were holding an economics-related job at the time of the survey and nearly 60 percent
had ever held such a job. These percentages are quite high and reflect the fact that those
who applied to the program already had some interest in economics. We focus our
discussion on results from the pre-2003 balanced sample below.
We estimate that the AEA Summer Program increased the likelihood that
participants were holding, or ever held, a job in an economics-related occupation at the
time of the survey by about 11 percentage points, although the estimates are not
statistically significant at conventional levels. In contrast, we find that the program
significantly improved diversity in the profession as reflected in other measures. For
example, we estimate that participants were over 15 percentage points more likely to
currently have, or ever had, an academic job related to economics; participants were 30
percentage points more likely ever to have held an economics-related job in an
educational or research institution. Given that only about 5 percent of the comparison
group had an academic job related to economics at the time of the survey, only 9 percent
had ever had such a job, and around one-fifth had ever held a job in an educational or
research institution, these impacts are economically quite large.
While impressive, we caution that these estimates must likely be interpreted as
upper-bounds of the impact of the program as we do not have a randomly-assigned
control group. However, it is notable that the estimates are fairly stable across the three

18

samples and with and without controlling for available background characteristics.
Further, as shown in Appendix Table 1, they are also robust to using a non-linear probit
and to employing propensity score matching. We also note that given the program
appears to have encouraged more students to apply to graduate programs, the marginal
students may have been weaker which would bias against finding positive impacts on
PhD completion and later outcomes.20

The AEASP’s Cumulative Impact on the Number of Economics Doctorates
Taking the estimates at face value, we ask what impact the AEASP has likely had
on increasing diversity in the economics profession. We limit this thought exercise to the
impact on the number of doctorates awarded to minority students as we have outside
estimates of the total number of such doctorates from which to form a “universe.” Based
on the estimates in Table 3, AEASP alumni were 26 percentage points more likely to
complete a doctorate in economics than were unsuccessful applicants. To estimate the
cumulative impact of the AEASP on the number of doctorates awarded in economics, we
use the following simplified calculation. Let P be the number of minority undergraduates
who were potential applicants for economics PhD programs in a typical year, r the
likelihood that these students would have eventually completed an economics PhD
without the AEASP intervention, k the AEASP program effect, A the number of students
who attended the AEASP in a particular year, and G the total number of minority
students from that year who eventually completed an economics PhD. We then have,

20

As evidence of the program encouraging more marginal students to apply, the coefficient estimate on
AEASP participation in a linear probability model predicting PhD completion, is negative (although
statistically insignificant) conditional on having enrolled in a PhD program in the pre-2003 balanced
sample. These results are available on request.

19

 −  +  +  = .
This simplifies to
 +  = .
In any one year the contribution of the AEASP to the proportion of doctorates
awarded to minorities is (A×k)/G. The aggregate contribution is therefore the sum of A×k
divided by the sum of G over T years:
∑  x 
.
∑
Assuming the effect of the program on completing an economics PhD estimated in the
pre-2003 balanced sample is similar in other years, we use kt = 0.26 for all t.21 Between
1993 and 2012, a total of 628 or 777 economics doctorates were conferred to minorities,
depending on the data source.22 On average 25 students attended AEASP annually (i.e.,
500 students total in 20 years). Therefore, between 1993 and 2012, between 17 and 21
percent (500/628 × 0.26 and 500/777 × 0.26) of the doctorates in economics conferred to
minorities can be directly attributed to the AEASP.23 These estimates imply that the
program was responsible for an additional 130 PhDs earned in economics and related
fields by American minorities over the 20-year period. Given that AEASP operation
costs during this period were roughly $12 million ($600,000×20, in 2013 dollars), and

21

We assume that the applicants to the AEASP were potential applicants for economics PhD programs in
the year following their college graduation and that the treatment effect of the program applies to all
minority students who might have applied to a doctoral program in economics.
22
We obtain the number of degrees conferred to minorities from two sources, both through NSF's
WebCASPAR database. 777 is from the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates/Doctorate Records File and 628
is from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions Survey (IPEDS CS). Note that
IPEDS CS data are only available since 1995. We impute 1993 and 1994 values using the average of 19951999 data. Both numbers include U.S. citizen and permanent residents only. Minority is defined as Native
American, Black and Hispanic, the same way as defined in Figure 1.
23
In this simple calculation, we assume that minority students awarded an economics PhD between 1993
and 2012 are equal in numbers to future PhDs generated by potential PhD applicants during this same 20year period.

20

ignoring individuals’ opportunity costs, the implied financial cost of “producing” a new
minority PhD is about $92,500.
To get a sense of the magnitude of this figure, consider the cost of alternative
strategies to increase racial and ethnic diversity. One strategy might be to identify
talented students at institutions that rarely send students directly to doctoral programs
(call them “solid-but-non-elite”) and pay the cost differential to send them to institutions
that do send students directly to doctoral programs (call them “elite”), and, further, set up
the students to succeed. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this strategy,
ignoring administrative and advising costs, would require at least $500,000 per PhD
produced – roughly five times that of the AEASP.24 Alternatively, one might support a
program to help minority students to get a master’s degree in preparation for doctoral
programs. There are an increasing number of these types of programs, and they vary in
cost and duration. To our knowledge, of those with a doctoral placement focus, only
Duke and Howard have large minority student populations in their economics graduate
programs. A back-of-the-envelope calculation, ignoring administrative costs, suggests
that this strategy would cost about $300,000 per PhD produced – that is, three times that
of the AEASP.25

24

In this thought experiment, we assume that the selected participants would need to complete four years of
undergraduate study at the elite institution, since most students entering these institutions, and especially
those going on to doctoral programs, typically start with calculus and other AP credits. Based on tuition and
costs for the 2013-2014 academic year at Duke and North Carolina A&T State University, we assume that
the cost differential between “elite” and “solid-but-non-elite” institutions is roughly $17,500/semester, or
$140,000 for a four year course of study (Duke, 2014; NC A&T, 2014). Living cost differentials add
roughly another $16,000. The likelihood of a selected student entering a doctoral degree program in
Economics is surely no more than 0.5, while the likelihood of completion conditional upon entering a
doctoral program is about 0.6 (Stock et al., 2006; Stock and Siegfried, 2013). The cost of producing a PhD
this way is at least $520,000 = $156,000/(0.5*0.6).
25
The cost of completing a master’s degree at Howard is approximately $94,000 ($25,000 tuition/year +
$22,000 expenses/year). The cost at Duke is approximately $128,000 ($44,000 tuition/year + $20,000
expenses/year). The unweighted average is $111,000; if we generously assume that half of those selected

21

We are confident there are other, potentially lower cost, ways to increase the
number of minority PhDs and our estimates should not be interpreted as dispositive.
However, these simple thought experiments imply that the AEASP is inexpensive relative
to obvious alternatives.

V.

Conclusion
In this paper we estimate a sizeable impact of the AEA summer program (AEASP)

on racial and ethnic diversity in the economics profession. Specifically, we find that the
program may have increased the likelihood that students pursued graduate work in
economics, were more likely to complete a doctorate and were more likely to pursue
careers related to economics. These estimates do not, however, take into consideration
the impact of the Summer Program on the caliber of the PhD programs attended by
participants nor any indirect impacts generated by having more role models and peers in
the profession.
Obviously these estimates did not derive from a controlled experiment. They are,
however, fairly robust across a variety of specifications and with the inclusion of
covariates. While it is conceivable that residual unobserved differences between the
AEASP participants and the comparison group are biasing the estimated impacts, we are
encouraged that the coefficient estimates are relatively insensitive to the inclusion of
additional covariates. Furthermore, while ultimately we suspect that any selection bias is
likely positive, it is also worth noting that many of those AEASP alumni who were the
most talented and with the best social skills may have found non-academic careers more

will enter doctoral programs and three fourth will complete the PhD conditional upon entering a doctoral
program, the cost of producing a PhD via a master’s degree program is nearly $300,000 per PhD.

22

financially rewarding and exciting. The program also appears to have encouraged more
marginal students to apply to graduate school which would work against finding a
positive impact on post-doctoral outcomes. Finally, selectivity is unlikely to be time
invariant, but rather would likely reflect opportunity costs (and the selection goals of the
different hosts). Clearly a more rigorous evaluation could (and should) be contemplated
to generate more reliable and nuanced estimates of the program, such as the value of a
second year.
This final caveat in mind, it is useful to consider why the program has likely been
so successful.

Most obviously, it has provided mathematics, statistics, writing,

presentation, and economic modelling skills of direct use to graduate study. In addition,
the shock of being confronted with an overwhelming work load and learning how to deal
with it, and more generally improve time management skills, may also have helped to
better prepare the students for graduate work. Students have also received advising on
how to prepare for graduate study, on the institutions at which they might thrive, on
which courses to take in the upcoming academic year prior to applying, and ongoing
mentoring from AEASP faculty and administrators while in graduate school and links to
subsequent support systems. Finally, the program may have had psychological effects,
by boosting confidence, providing a peer support group and introductions to wider
networks, and exposure to role models. Better understanding of the mechanisms by
which the program may be improving student interest and success in economics would be
useful to designing and improving the program in the future.

Note: Treatment effects of propensity score matching are estimated using the kernel matching method. The propensity score satisfies
the balancing property in all samples. Marginal effects at means are reported for the probit estimation. All treatment effects are
estimated using the same specification as in Appendix Table 3A-3M. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, *** represent
p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.1, respectively.

Note: Regressions with covariates impute missing values in covariates. For continuous covariates,
we impute the missing values by the treatment/comparison group mean and include imputation
dummies in regressions. For dummies, we impute the missing values by 0 and include imputation
dummies in regressions. The list of covariates listed in this table, plus imputation dummies and a
constant term, constitute the full specification for column (2), (4), and (6). It is also the
specification used for treatment effect with covariates in Table 3 and Appendix Table 1."Elite"
institutions are those identified as those that are "very competitive and very high research activity"
by the 2010 Carnegie Classification. Robust standard are errors in parentheses. *, **, *** represent
p<0.01, p<0.05, p<0.1, respectively.
