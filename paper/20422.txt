ABSTRACT
Can we identify the members of a community who are best- placed to diffuse information simply
by asking a random sample of individuals? We show that boundedly-rational individuals can, simply
by tracking sources of gossip, identify those who are most central in a network according to “diffusion
centrality,” which nests other standard centrality measures. Testing this prediction with data from
35 Indian villages, we find that respondents accurately nominate those who are diffusion central (not
just those with many friends). Moreover, these nominees are more central in the network than traditional
village leaders and geographically central individuals.

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

1. Introduction
“The secret of my influence has always been that it remained
secret.” – Salvador Dalı́
Knowing who is influential, or central, in a community, can be important
for the community’s members as well as for businesses and policymakers. In
particular, the extent to which a piece of information diffuses among a population often depends on how central the initially informed are within the network
(see Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955); Rogers (1995); Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos
(2003, 2005); Borgatti (2005); Ballester, Calvó-Armengol, and Zenou (2006);
Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, and Jackson (2013)). Policymakers and organizations can thus benefit from targeting the right individuals in efforts to
effectively spread valuable information.
However, learning who is central in a social network has the potential to be
difficult. For policymakers, collecting detailed network data is costly. Even
for members of the community, knowing the structure of the network beyond
their immediate friends is far from automatic. Do people know how central
other people, outside of their immediate circle, are? In this paper, we answer
this question theoretically and empirically.
First, we develop a simple model, building upon our previous work (Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, and Jackson, 2013), to show that individuals in a
network should be able to identify central individuals within their community
without knowing anything about the structure of the network. Our model is
about a process we call gossip, where nodes generate pieces of information
that are then stochastically passed from neighbor to neighbor. We assume
that individuals who hear the gossip are able to keep count of the number of
times each person in the network get mentioned.1 We show that for any listener in the network, the relative ranking under this count converges over time
to the correct ranking of every node’s ability to send information to the rest
1

We use the term “gossip” to refer to the spreading of information about particular people.
Our diffusion process is focused on basic information that is not subject to the biases or manipulations that might accompany some “rumors” (e.g., see Bloch, Demange, and Kranton
(2014)).

of the network. The specific measure of a node’s ability to send information
that we use is given by the “diffusion centrality,” introduced in Banerjee et al.
(2013) which answers the question of how widely information from a given
node diffuses in a given number of time periods and for a given random per
period transmission probability. We relate diffusion centrality to other standard measures of centrality in the literature, proving that it nests three of the
most prominent measures: degree centrality at one extreme (if there is just one
time period of communication), and eigenvector centrality and Katz-Bonacich
centrality at the other extreme (if there are unlimited periods of communication). For intermediate numbers of periods diffusion centrality takes on a wide
range of other values.
In other words, by listening and keeping count of how often they hear about
someone, individuals learn the correct ranking of community members from
the point of view of how effectively they can serve as a source of information
to the rest of the community.
Second, we use a unique dataset to assess whether this holds empirically. We
asked every adult in each of 35 villages to name the person in their village best
suited to initiate the spread of information. We combine their answers (which
we call their “nominations”) with detailed network data that include maps of
a variety of interactions in each of the 35 villages. We show that individuals
nominate highly diffusion/eigenvector central people (on average at the 71st
percentile of centrality). We also show that the nominations are not simply
based on the nominee’s leadership status or geographic position in the village,
but are significantly correlated with diffusion centrality even after conditioning
on these characteristics, and are better predictors of centrality than these
characteristics. This suggests that people understand our questions and are
doing more than simply naming traditional leaders or geographically central
individuals. Furthermore, there is suggestive evidence that they nominate
people who are indeed diffusion central, not only people with many friends.
In sum, our model shows how individuals can learn who are the most central
people in their network, and our empirical work suggests that individuals have
learned this (although, of course, the data could be consistent with other
models of how people choose individuals to nominate). To our knowledge, this

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

is the first paper to demonstrate that members of communities are able, easily
and accurately, to identify highly central people in their community. It is also
the first to describe a simple process by which people can learn things about
part of their broader network that may intuitively seem outside their ambit.2
This is a result of practical importance, since asking people who is the best
person to spread information is a much cheaper way to collect this information
than collecting data on the entire network.

2. A Model of Network Communication
We consider the following model.
2.1. A Network of Individuals. A society of n individuals are connected
via a possibly directed3 and weighted network, which has an adjacency matrix
g ∈ {0, 1}n×n . Unless otherwise stated, we take the network g to be fixed
and let v (1) be its first (right-hand) eigenvector, corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue λ1 .4 The first eigenvector is nonnegative and real-valued by the
Perron-Frobenius Theorem.
Throughout, we assume that the network is (strongly) connected in that
there exists a (directed) path from every node to every other node, so that
information originating at any node could potentially make its way eventually
to any other node.5
2.2. Diffusion Centrality. Banerjee et al. (2013) defined a notion of centrality called diffusion centrality, based on random information flow through a
network according to the following process, which is a variation of a standard
diffusion process that underlies many contagion models.6
2

There are some papers (e.g., Milgram (1967) and Dodds et al. (2003)) that have checked
people’s abilities to use knowledge of their friends’ connections to efficiently route messages
to reach distant people, but those rely on local knowledge.
3When defining g in the directed case, the ij-th entry should indicate that i can tell something to j. In some networks, this may not be reciprocal.
4v (1) is such that gv (1) = λ v (1) where λ is the largest eigenvalue of g in magnitude.

5
More generally, everything we say applies to the components of the network.

See Jackson and Yariv (2011) for background and references. A continuous time version of
diffusion centrality appears in Lawyer (2014).

A piece of information is initiated at node i and then broadcast outwards
from that node. In each period, each informed node informs each of its neighbors of the piece of information and the identity of its original source with a
probability p ∈ (0, 1], independently across neighbors and history. The process
operates for T periods, where T is a positive integer.
There are many reasons to allow T to be finite. For instance, a new piece
of information may only be “news” for a limited time. Because of boredom,
arrival of other news, the topic of conversation may change. By allowing for
a variety of T ’s, diffusion centrality admits important finite-horizon cases, as
well as more extreme cases where agents discuss a topic indefinitely.7
Diffusion centrality measures how extensively the information spreads as a
function of the initial node. In particular, let
H(g; p, T ) :=

T
X

(pg)t ,

t=1

be the “hearing matrix.” The ij-th entry of H, H(g; p, T )ij , is the expected
number of times, in the first T periods, that j hears about a piece of information originating from i. Diffusion centrality is then defined by
DC(g; p, T ) := H(g; p, T ) · 1 =

T
X

!
t

(pg)

· 1.

t=1

So, DC(g; p, T )i is the expected total number of times that some piece of
information that originates from i is heard by any of the members of the society
during a T -period time interval.8 Banerjee et al. (2013) showed that diffusion

7Of course this is an approximation and, moreover, different topics may have different T ’s.
The current model and definition already moves beyond the literature, but even richer
models could also be studied.
8 We note two useful normalizations. One is to compare it to what would happen if p = 1
and g were the complete network gc , which produces the maximum possible entry for
each ij subject to any T . Thus, each entry of DC(g; p, T ) could be divided through by
the corresponding entry of DC(gc ; 1, T ). This produces a measure for which every entry
lies between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to the maximum possible numbers of expected
paths possible in T periods with full probability weight and full connectedness. Another
normalization is to compare
P a given node to the total level for all nodes; that is, to divide all
entries of DC(g; p, T ) by i DC i (g; p, T ). This normalization tracks how relatively diffusive
one node is compared to the average diffusiveness in its society.

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

6

centrality was a statistically significant predictor of the spread of information
– in that case, about a microfinance program.
Note that this measure allows people to hear the information multiple times
from the same person and count those times as distinct reports, so that it is
possible for an entry of DC to be more than n. There are several advantages
to defining it in this manner. First, although it is possible via simulations
to calculate a measure that tracks the expected number of informed nodes
and avoids double-counting, this expression is much easier to calculate and
for many parameter values the two measures are roughly proportional to each
other. Second, this version of the measure relates nicely to other standard
measures of centrality in the literature, while a measure that adjusts for multiple hearing does not. Third, in a world in which multiple hearings lead to
a greater probability of information retention, this count might actually be a
better measure of what people learn.9
2.3. Diffusion Centrality’s Relation to Other Centrality Measures. It
is useful to situate diffusion centrality relative to other prominent measures of
centrality in the literature.
P
Let d(g) denote degree centrality (so di (g) = j gij ). Eigenvector centrality
corresponds to v (1) (g): the first eigenvector of g. Also, let KB(g, p) denote
Katz-Bonacich centrality – defined for p < 1/λ1 by:10
KB(p, g) :=

· 1.

It is direct to see that (i) diffusion centrality is proportional to degree centrality at the extreme at which T = 1, and (ii) if p < 1/λ1 , then diffusion
centrality coincides with Katz-Bonacich centrality if we set T = ∞. We now
show that when p > 1/λ1 diffusion centrality approaches eigenvector centrality as T approaches ∞, which then completes the picture of the relationship
between diffusion centrality and extreme centrality measures.
9One

could also further enrich the measure by allowing for the forgetting of information,
but with three parameters the measure would start to become unwieldy.
10See (2.7) in Jackson (2008) for additional discussion and background. This was a measure
first discussed by Katz, and corresponds to Bonacich’s definition when both of Bonacich’s
parameters are set to p.

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

7

The difference between the extremes of Katz-Bonacich centrality and eigenvector centrality depends on whether p is sufficiently small so that limited
diffusion takes place even in the limit of large T , or whether p is sufficiently
large so that the knowledge saturates the network and then it is only relative
amounts of saturation that are being measured.11
Theorem 1.
(1) Diffusion centrality is proportional to degree when T = 1:
DC (g; p, 1) = pd (g) .
(2) If p ≥ 1/λ1 , then as T → ∞ diffusion centrality approximates eigenvector centrality:

(3) For T = ∞ and p < 1/λ1 , diffusion centrality is Katz-Bonacich centrality:
DC (g; p, ∞) = KB (g, p) ; p < 1/λ1 .
All proofs appear in the Appendix.
The result shows that as T is varied, diffusion centrality nests three of the
most prominent and used centrality measures: degree centrality, eigenvector
centrality, and Katz-Bonacich centrality. It thus provides a foundation for
these measures and spans between them.12, 13 Between these extremes, diffusion centrality measures how diffusion process operates for some limited

connected network, if one entry diverges, then all entries diverge). Nonetheless, the limit
vector is still proportional to a well defined limit vector: the first eigenvector.
12This formalizes a result we mention in (Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, and Jackson,
2013). An independent formalization appears in Benzi and Klymko (2014).
13We also remark on the comparison to another measure: the influence vector that appears
in the DeGroot learning model (see, e.g., Golub and Jackson (2010)). That metric captures
how influential a node is in a process of social learning. It corresponds to the (left-hand)
unit eigenvector of a stochasticized matrix of interactions rather than a raw adjacency
matrix. While it might be tempting to use that metric here as well, we note that it is the
right conceptual object to use in a process of repeated averaging through which individuals
update opinions based on averages of their neighbors’ opinions. It is thus conceptually
different from the diffusion process that we study. One can define a variant of diffusion
centrality that works for finite iterations of DeGroot updating.

number of periods. Importantly, as in Banerjee et al. (2013), the behavior in
the intermediate ranges can be more relevant for certain diffusion phenomena.

3. Relating Diffusion Centrality to Network Gossip
We now investigate whether and how individuals living in g end up with
knowledge of others’ positions in the network that correlates with diffusion
centrality without knowing anything about the network structure.
3.1. A Gossip Process. Diffusion centrality considers diffusion from the
sender’s perspective. Let us now consider the same stochastic information
diffusion process but from a receiver’s perspective. Over time, each individual
hears information that originates from different sources in the network, and in
turn randomly pass that information on. The society discusses each of these
pieces of information for T periods. The key point is that there are many such
topics of conversation, originating from all of the different individuals in the
society, with each topic being passed along for T periods.
For instance, Arun may tell Matt that he has a new car. Matt then may
tell Abhijit that “Arun has a new car,” and then Abhijit may tell Esther that
“Arun has a new car.” Arun may also have told Ben that he thinks house
prices will go up and Ben could have told Esther that “Arun thinks that house
prices will go up”. In this model Esther keeps track of the cumulative number
of times that bits of information that originated from Arun reach her and
compares it with the same number for information that originated from other
people. What is crucial therefore is that the news involves the name of the
node of origin – in this case “Arun” – and not what the information is about.
The first piece of news originating from Arun could be about something he has
done (“bought a car”) but the second could just be an opinion (“Arun thinks
house prices will go up”). Esther keeps track of the fact that she has heard
two different pieces of information originating from Arun.
Recall that
H(g; p, T ) =

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

is such that the ij-th entry, H(g; p, T )ij , is the expected number of times j
hears a piece of information originating from i.
We define the network gossip heard by node j to be the j-th column of H,
N G(g; p, T )j := H(g; p, T )·j .
Thus, N Gj lists the expected number of times a node j will hear a given
piece of news as a function of the node of origin of the information. So, if
N G(g; p, T )ij is twice as high as N G(g; p, T )kj then j is expected to hear news
twice as often that originated at node i compared to node k, presuming equal
rates of news originating at i and k.
Note the different perspectives of DC and N G: diffusion centrality tracks
how well information spreads from a given node, while network gossip tracks
relatively how often a given node hears information from (or about) each of
the other nodes.
To end this sub-section two remarks are in order. First, one could allow
passing probabilities to differ by information type and pairs of nodes.14 Indeed,
in Banerjee et al. (2013) we allowed different nodes to pass information with
different probabilities, and in Banerjee et al. (2014) we allow the probability
of communication to depend on the listener’s network position. Although
one can enrich the model in many ways to capture specifics of information
passing, this simple version captures basic dynamics and relates naturally to
centrality measures. Second, we could allow nodes to differ in how frequently
they generate new information which is then transmitted to its neighbors.
Provided this transmission rate is positively related to nodes’ centralities, the
results that we present below still hold (and, in fact, the speed of convergence
would be increased).
3.2. Identifying Central Individuals. With this measure of gossip in hand,
we show how individuals in a society can estimate who is central simply by

that Pij can depend on characteristics of those involve and encode strategic behavior based

counting how often they hear gossip about others. We first show that, on
average, individuals’ rankings of others according to how much gossip they
hear about the others, given by N Gj , are positively correlated with diffusion
centrality.
Theorem 2. For any (g; p, T ), j cov(DC(g; p, T ), N G(g; p, T )j ) = var(DC).
Thus, in any network with differences in diffusion centrality among individuals, the average covariance between diffusion centrality and network gossip is
positive.
P

It is important to emphasize that although both measures, N Gi and DCi ,
are based on the same sort of information process, they are really two quite
different objects. Diffusion centrality is a gauge of a node’s ability to send
information, while the network gossip measure tracks the reception of information by different nodes. Indeed, the reason that Theorem 2 is only stated
for the sum rather than any particular individual j’s network gossip measure is
that for small T it is possible that some nodes have not even heard about other
nodes, and moreover they might be biased towards their local neighborhoods.15
Next, we show that if individuals exchange gossip over extended periods
of time, every individual in the network is eventually able to perfectly rank
others’ centralities.
Theorem 3. If p ≥ 1/λ1 , then as T → ∞ every individual j’s ranking of others under N G(g; p, T )j will be according to the ranking of diffusion centrality,
DC(g; p, T ), and hence according to eigenvector centrality, v (1) .
The intuition is that individuals hear (exponentially) more often about those
who are more diffusion/eigenvector central, as the number of rounds of communication tends to infinity. As such, in the limit, they assess the rankings
15

One might conjecture that more central nodes would be better “listeners”: for instance,
having more accurate rankings than less central listeners after a small number of periods.
Although this might happen in some networks, and for many comparisons, it is not guaranteed. None of the centrality measures considered here ensure that a given node, even the
most central node, is positioned in a way to “listen” uniformly better than all other less
central nodes. Typically, even a most central node might be farther than some less central
node from some other important nodes. This can lead a less central node to hear some
things before even the most central node, and thus to have a clearer ranking
P of at least
some of the network before the most central node. Thus, for small T , the
is important
in Theorem 2.

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

11

according to diffusion/eigenvector centrality correctly. The result implies that
with very little computational ability beyond remembering counts and adding
to them, agents come to learn arbitrarily accurately complex measures of others’ centralities, even for people with whom they do not associate.
More sophisticated strategies in which individuals try to infer network topology, could accelerate learning. Nonetheless, this result holds even in a minimal
environment wherein individuals do not know the structure of the network and
do not tag anything but the topic of conversation (“Arun has a new car”).
The restriction to p ≥ 1/λ1 is important. For example, as p tends to 0, then
individuals hear with vanishing frequency about others in the network, and
network distance between people can matter in determining whom they think
is the most important.

4. Data
To investigate the theory presented above, we examine new data, coupled
with detailed network data gathered from villages in rural Karnataka (India).
The network data consist of network information combined with “gossip” data
for 35 villages.
To collect the network data (described in more details in (Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, and Jackson, 2013), and publicly available at http://economics.
mit.edu/faculty/eduflo/social), we surveyed adults regarding with whom
they interact.16 We have data concerning 12 types of interactions for a given
survey respondent: (1) whose houses he or she visits, (2) who visit his or her
house, (3) his or her relatives in the village, (4) non-relatives who socialize with
him or her, (5) who gives him or her medical advice, (6) from whom he or she
borrows money, (7) to whom he or she lends money, (8) from whom he or
she borrows material goods (e.g., kerosene, rice), (9) to whom he or she lends
material goods, (10) from whom he or she gets advice, (11) to whom he or she
gives advice, (12) with whom he or she goes to pray (e.g., at a temple, church
or mosque). Using these data, we construct one network for each village, at

65% of all adult individuals aged 18-55.

the household level where a link exists between households if any member of
any household is linked to any other member of any other household in at
least one of the 12 ways.17 The resulting objects are undirected, unweighted
networks at the household level.
To collect the gossip data, we later asked the adults the following two additional questions:
(Loan) If we want to spread information about a new loan product to everyone
in your village, to whom do you suggest we speak?
(Event) If we want to spread information to everyone in the village about tickets
to a music event, drama, or fair that we would like to organize in your
village, to whom should we speak?

deviation of 61.7, while the average degree is 17.7 with a standard deviation
of 9.8.
We see that only 5% of households were named in response to the Loan
question (and 4% for the Event question) with a cross-village standard deviation of 3%. Thus there is a substantial concordance in who is named as a good
initiator of diffusion within a village. In fact, conditional on being nominated,
a household was nominated nine times on average.18 This is perhaps a first
indication that the answers may be meaningful.
The fact that less than half of the households were willing to name someone,
is itself intriguing. Perhaps people are unwilling to offer an opinion when they
are unsure of the answer19 or possibly were afraid of offending someone, given
that they were asked to name just one person.
We label as “leaders” self-help group leaders, shopkeepers, teachers, etc.:
13% of households fall into this category. We use the term as it was defined by
the microfinance organization Bharatha Swamukti Samsthe (BSS) as part of
their strategy for identifying people to initiate diffusion for their product. BSS
approached such social leaders because they were a priori likely to be important
in the social learning process and thereby would contribute to more diffusion
of microfinance. In our earlier work, Banerjee et al. (2013), we show that there
is considerable variation in the centrality of these “leaders” in a network sense,
and that this variation predicts the eventual take up of microfinance.

5. Empirical Analysis
Our theoretical results suggest that people can learn others’ diffusion or
eigenvector centralities simply by tracking news they hear through the network.
Thus, they should be able to name central individuals when asked whom to
use as a “seed” for diffusion. If this is the case, such direct questions can easily
be added to standard survey modules to identify central individuals without
obtaining detailed network data.
18We work at the household level,

in keeping with Banerjee et al. (2013) who used households
as network nodes; a household receives a nomination if any of its members are nominated.
19See Alatas et al. (2014) for a model that builds on this idea.

5.1. Descriptive Evidence. Figure 1 shows a village network where we highlight both the nominees and the village leaders used by BSS as seeds for microfinance information, and thus the best guess of this organization of the most
highly central people.20 We see in the figure that “leaders” include central
households but also some peripheral households. However, nominees appear
to be more central and are rarely peripheral. Additionally, nodes that are both
leaders and nominated are highly central.
Let us examine the relative network position of nominees in detail. Since
the relevant number of periods to compute diffusion centrality is in principle
application-dependent, we start with eigenvector centrality, which is a limit as
T → ∞ of diffusion centrality for large enough p (above the inverse of the first
eigenvalue). We return to compare what happens with other p and T , below.
Figure 2 builds on the theme presented in Figure 1. Examining the likelihood that a nominated household is highly central, we find that 47% of
households that are both nominated and have a leader are within the top 10%
of the eigenvector centrality distribution. Furthermore, 23% of the households
that are nominated but are not leaders are in the top decile of the centrality
distribution.
This contrasts with households that are not nominated, irrespective of whether
they have a leader. Only 16% of households that are not nominated but have a
leader, and only 7% of households that are not nominated and have no leader,
are in the top decile of the eigenvector centrality distribution.21 Another way
to see this is that the average percentile in the distribution of eigenvector centrality for those nominated for the loan question is 0.71 (and 0.7 for event),
while it is 0.62 for the traditional leaders.
Not only are nominated nodes more central in the network, but more central
nodes also receive more nominations, as predicted by the theory. Figure 3
shows that households with higher levels of eigenvector centrality receive more

20This

is not a geographic representation of nodes but, rather, a representation using a
simple algorithm to visually represent the sub-community structure of the network.
21The difference between the 23% of households that are in the top decile given that they are
nominated but not leaders and the 16% in the top decile given that they are not nominated
but are leaders is significant with a p-value of 0.00 under a Welch test.

through the social network, we might imagine that individuals would only
nominate households to whom they are directly connected. Panel A of Figure
4 shows that fewer than 20% of individuals nominate someone within their
direct neighborhood. At the same time, over 27% of nominations come from a
network distance of at least three or more. Taken together, this suggests that
information about centrality does indeed travel through the network.
From Panel A of Figure 4, we also see that, while people do nominate
individuals in households who are closer to them than the typical household
in the village, respondents generally name people outside of their immediate
neighborhoods and sometimes quite far. Moreover, it is important to note
that highly central individuals are generally closer to people than the typical
household, so, if they did nominate the most central people, this is what we
should expect to find.

vs. the quintile of the households’ eigenvector centralities.

It is plausible that individuals may not have good information about who is
central in parts of the network that are far from them. However, in Panel B
of Figure 4 we see that the average eigenvector centrality percentile of those
named at distance 1 is the same as at distance 2 or distance 3 or more. This
suggests that individuals have reasonable and comparably accurate information about central individuals in the community who are immediate neighbors
or at greater distance from them.
5.2. Regression Analysis. Motivated by this evidence, we present a more
systematic analysis of the correlates of nominations, using a discrete choice
framework for the decision to nominate someone.
Our theory suggests that if people choose whom to nominate by picking
someone whom they hear about most frequently, then diffusion centrality
should be a leading predictor of nominations. While the aforementioned results are consistent with this prediction, there are several plausible alternative
interpretations. For example, individuals may nominate the person with the
most friends, and people with many friends tend to be more diffusion central
than those with fewer friends (i.e., diffusion centrality with T = 1 and T > 1

Figure 4. Distribution of centralities of nominees
can be positively correlated). Alternatively, it may be that people simply nominate “leaders” within their village, or people who are central geographically,
and these also correlate with diffusion/eigenvector centrality. There are indeed
a priori reasons to think that leadership status and geography may be good
predictors of network centrality, since, as noted in Banerjee et al. (2013), the
microfinance organization selected “leaders” precisely because they believed
these people would be informationally central. Similarly, previous research
has shown that geographic proximity increases the probability of link formation (Fafchamps and Gubert, 2007; Ambrus et al., 2014; Chandrasekhar and
Lewis, 2014) and therefore one might expect geographic data to be a useful
predictor of centrality. In addition to leadership data we have detailed GPS
coordinates for every household in each village. We include this in our analysis
below.22
22To

operationalize geographic centrality, we use two measures. The first uses the center of
mass. We compute the center of mass and then compute the geographic distance for each
agent i from the center of mass. Centrality is the inverse of this distance, which we normalize
by the standard deviation of this measure by village. The second uses the geographic data
1
to construct an adjacency matrix. We denote the ij entry of this matrix to be d(i,j)
where
d(·, ·) is the geographic distance. Given this weighted graph, we compute the eigenvector
centrality measure associated with this network. Results are robust to either definition.

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

19

Of course, the correlations below are not a “test” that the causal mechanism
is indeed gossip, as in our model, but they do rule out that our diffusion
centrality measure simply picks out degree centrality, geography or traditional
leadership.
To operationalize our analysis using diffusion centrality, we need to first
identify p and T . We use the average of the transmission probability parameters estimated in Banerjee et al. (2013), which studies the diffusion of
information about a loan, and finds p = 0.2. We set T = 3, since the average distance between nodes in our network is 2.7 and thus 3 represents the
distance to which information travels before it begins to echo backwards. In
what follows, we use DC(0.2, 3) when we refer to diffusion centrality.
We estimate a discrete choice model of the decision to nominate an individual. Note that we have large choice sets as there are n − 1 possible nominees
and n nominators per village network. We model agent i as receiving utility
ui (j) for nominating individual j:
ui (j) = α + β 0 xj + γ 0 zj + µv + ij,v ,
where xj is a vector of network centralities for j (eigenvector centrality, DC(0.2, 3),
and degree centrality), zj is a vector of demographic characteristics (e.g., leadership status, geographic position and caste controls), µv is a village fixed
effect, and iv,j is a Type-I extreme value distributed disturbance. For convenience given the large choice sets, we estimate the conditional logit model by
an equivalent Poisson regression, where the outcome is the expected number
of times an alternative is selected (Palmgren, 1981; Baker, 1994; Lang, 1996;
Guimaraes et al., 2003).
Table 2 presents our estimates of β and γ. First we show that DC(0.2, 3)
is a significant driver of an individual nominating another (column 1). A one
standard deviation increase in eigenvector centrality is associated with a 0.634
log-point increase in the number of others nominating a household (statistically
significant at the 1% level). In column 2 we see that this is robust to controlling
for leadership status, geographic centrality of households, as well as village and
caste fixed effects: a one standard deviation increase in diffusion centrality is
associated with a 0.616 log-point increase in the number of others nominating

Notes: The table reports estimate of a Poisson regression where the outcome variable is the expected number of
nominations under the loan question. Degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and DC(0.2, 3) are normalized by
within-village standard deviation. Standard errors (clustered at the village level) are reported in parentheses. ***

the household (significant at the 1% level). Leadership status does affect the
number of nominations as well, as we saw in the descriptive evidence, but the
point estimate of the diffusion centrality coefficient hardly changes.
In columns 3-5 we add eigenvector and degree centrality as points of comparison. It seems that it is indeed diffusion centrality that best predicts nominations. A one standard deviation in DC(0.2, 3) corresponds to a 0.639 log-point
increase in the number of nominations (statistically significant at the 5% level)
as compared to -0.005 log-points when looking at eigenvector centrality (not
statistically significant, column 3). Similarly, including both DC(0.2, 3) and
degree centrality leaves the coefficient on DC(0.2, 3) mostly unchanged, a 0.749
log-point increase in the number of nominations associated with a one standard
deviation increase in centrality, whereas there is no statistically significant association with degree centrality and the point estimate is considerably smaller
(-0.117, column 4). However, parameter estimates are noisy and one cannot
reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on DC(0.2, 3) and eigenvector centrality as well as DC(0.2, 3) and degree are statistically the same, despite the

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

21

difference in the point estimates. The p-values of a test of equality of coefficients are 0.248 and 0.279 in columns 3 and 4, respectively (see the last row
of the table). Further, we include all three centrality measures in column 5
and are unable to reject that any individual coefficient is statistically different
from zero, although they are jointly significant with a p-value of 0.00). The
point estimate of DC(0.2, 3) remains similar to those in column 4, and both
degree and eigenvector centrality have negative point estimates. However, due
to the colinearity of the three centrality variables, standard errors are more
than twice as large than in the previous columns. Columns 6-8 repeat the exercises of columns 3-5, now including leadership status and geographic centrality
as extra control variables. Additionally, we add village and household caste
fixed effects. As before we find that DC(0.2, 3) enters significantly and with
similar effect sizes, unless all three centralities are included, where the estimates become noisy. Moreover, in our pairwise comparisons neither degree nor
eigenvector centrality coefficients are large and statistically significant drivers
of the number of nominations.
Our results provide suggestive evidence that a key driver of the nomination decision involves diffusion centrality with T > 1 although, given the high
degree of correlation of these metrics in our sample, we cannot statistically reject that all centrality variables matter equally. The point estimates, however,
point towards the diffusion centrality as the most robust factor. Overall, it is
clear that individuals are able to accurately name highly central individuals,
well beyond using other status variables.

6. Concluding Remarks
Our model illustrates that it should be easy for even very myopic and nonBayesian agents, simply by counting, to have an idea as to who is central in
their community (according to fairly complex definitions). Motivated by this,
we asked villagers to identify central individuals in their village. They do not
simply name locally central individuals (the most central among those they
know), but actually name ones that are globally central within the village. This

GOSSIP: IDENTIFYING CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK

22

suggests that individuals may use simple protocols to learn valuable things
about the complex systems within which they are embedded.
Our findings have important policy implications, since such nomination data
are easily collected and therefore can be used in a variety of contexts, either on
its own, or combined with other easily collected data, to identify who would be
a good seed for an information. For instance, if a household is both a nominee
and a leader, it has a 47% likelihood of being in the top 10% of the centrality
distribution.
It is also worth commenting that our work focuses on the network-based mechanics of communication. In practice, considerations beyond simple network
position may determine who the “best” person is to spread information, as
other characteristics may affect the quality and impact of communication. An
avenue for further research is to investigate whether villagers take such characteristics into account and thus may nominate individuals who are even more
successful at diffusing information than the most central individual in the network. Beyond these, the work presented here opens a rich agenda for further
research, as one can explore which other aspects of agents’ social environments
can be learned in simple ways.

Appendix A. Proofs
We prove all of the statements for the case of weighted and directed networks.
Let v (L,k) indicate k-th left-hand side eigenvector of g and similarly let v (R,k)
indicate g’s k-th right-hand side eigenvector. In the case of undirected networks, v (L,k) = v (R,k) . In the case of directed networks, eigenvector v (1) in the
main body corresponds to v (R,1) .
The following lemma is used in proofs of the theorems.

Lemma 1. Consider a positive and diagonalizable g. Then g has a unique
e = g/λ1 ,
largest eigenvalue. Moreover, letting g

[geT ]ij →T vi

Proof of Lemma 1. The uniqueness of the largest eigenvalue follows from
the Perron-Frobenius Theorem (given that g is positive). By diagonalizability
we can write g as
g = VΛV−1
where Λ is the matrix with eigenvalues on the diagonal (ordered from 1 to n in
order of magnitude) and V is the matrix with columns equal to the right-hand
eigenvectors, and V−1 is not only V’s inverse, but is also the matrix with rows
e = g/λ1 , it follows that

Since the largest eigenvalue of g is unique, it also follows that

It helps to write the ik-th entry of V as vi

Proof of Theorem 1. We show the second statement as the others follow
directly.
First, note that in any neighborhood of any nonnegative matrix g, there
exists a positive and diagonalizable matrix g0 . Next, consider any nonnegative
g. If the statement holds for any arbitrarily close positive and diagonalizable
DC(g;p,T )
g0 , then since P
T
t is a continuous function (in a neighborhood of a nont=1

(pλ1 )

negative and strongly connected g) as is the first eigenvector, the statement
also holds at g. Thus, it is enough to prove the result for a positive and
diagonalizable g, as in what follows.
In fact, we show the following strengthening of the statement for a positive
and diagonalizable g.
• The ‘tail terms’ approach eigenvector centrality:

which completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 3. Again, we prove the result for a positive diagonalizable g, noting that it then holds for any (nonnegative) g.
Again, let g be written as
g = VΛV−1 .
Also, let λ̃k = pλk . It then follows that we can write

to any other entries with higher or lower eigenvector centralities.
