International Capital Mobility in
Developing Countries vs. Industrial Countries:
What do Saving—Investment Correlations Tell Us?

ABSTRACT

The finding of Feldstein and Horioka (1980) that countries'
investment rates are highly correlated with their national saving rates has
by now been confirmed by many subsequent studies, even though their
inference that international capital mobility must be low has not been as
widely accepted. This paper examines the statistical relationship between
national saving and investment in a sample that includes not Only 1 L

industrialized countries, but also 50 developing

countries. The paper

addresses some of the econometric critiques that have been aimed
at the
Feldstein—Horioka work. Contrary to what one would expect from
consideration of capital mobility, the coefficient appears higher for
industrialized countries than for developing countries, and higher after
1973 than before.
Our interpretation of the saving—investment evidence is that the
hypothesis of a high degree of substitutability for claims on physical
capital located in different countries is not supported by the data.
International substitutability for financial capital may be high, but this
is a separate condition (which is properly tested by looking directly at
rates of return). High international substitutability for bonds would
inply high international substitutability for physical capital if capital
were perfectly substitutable for bonds within each country, but there is no
reason for this to hold, any more than there is for all goods to be perfect
substitutes.

Many subsequent studies have by now confirmed the finding of Feldstein
and Horioka (1980) that countries' investment rates are highly correlated

with their national saving rates. Nonetheless their inference that international capital mobility must be low has not been as widely accepted.

This paper examines the statistical relationship between national saving
and investment in a sample that includes not only 14 industrialized

countries, but also 50 developing countries. Contrary to what one would
expect from considerations of capital mobility, the coefficient appears
higher for industrialized countries than for developing countries, and

higher after 1973 than before. We find that these results survive
econometric techniques designed to deal with some of the critiques that

have been aimed at the Feldstein—Horjoka work.
Our interpretation of the saving—investment evidence is that the

hypothesis of a high degree of substitutability for claims on physical

capital located in different countries is not supported. There is no
contradiction between this conclusion and the hypothesis that some financial assets are perfect substitutes in the portfolios of international

investors. This is a separate condition (which is properly tested by
looking directly at rates of return). It could hold, and yet real
interest parity fail, if goods are not perfect substitutes. 1/

The puzzle of higher saving—investment correlations for industrialized
countries than for developing countries could then be explained by higher

real exchange rate variability among the former. Alternatively, if direct
international substitution between claims on physical capital--imperfect
as it is——is considered more relevant than the roundabout route through
financial capital and goods, then one could explain greater effects on
investment in industrialized countries than in developing countries, even
for the same degree of independent variability in rates of return, by
assuming that investment in physical capital is more responsive to the
domestic market rate of return in industrialized countries than in
developing countries.

I. Econometric Critiques of Savings—Investment Correlations
Most of the econometric criticisms of Feldstein and Horioka can
be subsumed in the general complaint that the righthand—side variable
is correlated with the error term, that is, that national saving is

endogenous. Though this problem is an ever—present danger in macroeconomics, it is particularly likely when the lefthandside and righthand—
side variables, together with the current account, are linked by an
identity.

Three conditions must hold before one could expect no relationship

between investment and saving rates. Each is strong.
Condition 1: a country's investment rate depends only on a "representative" national real rate of return r but not upon other variables

that are correlated with domestic savings. For convenience we assume
the relation to be linear:

—3—
(1) I/Y = a — hr + €.
The statistical support for the relationship
between investment and the

real interest rate has in fact

always been disappointingly weak. We know

that, at a minimum, there must be a large error term c.

But if investment

saving, it is crucial that this error term be

purely random, that it be uncorrelated not

only with the national rate of

return, but also with national saving.

investment and savings decisions

must equal the foreign expected rate of

If we think of the capital account as a function of

the differential in returns,

(2) KA = k(r—r*)
then the hypothesis is that k is infinite.

This is the only one of the

three conditions that could properly be associated with the phrase "inter-

national capital mobility" as traditionally understood. (The other two
Conditions are econometric ones.)

But, we will argue, financial capital

mobility may not be sufficient to produce

even this condition, if the

condition is interpreted as the international equalization of expected
real yields on physical capital.

Condition 3: the foreign expected rate of return relevant for
saving and investment is determined

exogenously. In other words, the

domestic country is not large enough in world financial markets to affect
the world interest rate.

— 4-..

The statistic in question is Cov(I/Y, NS/Y), where NS/Y is the ratio

of national saving (private plus public) to income. 1/ Using equation (1),
we can decompose this covariance into three parts:

(2) Cov(I/Y, NS/Y) = Cov(c, NS/Y) — h Cov(r_r*, NS/Y) — h Cov(r*, NS/Y)
Condition 1 says the first term is zero, condition 2 the second term, and

condition 3 the last term. If any of the three fails to hold, if any one
of the links is broken, then there is no reason to expect the investment
rate to be uncorrelated with the saving rate.

Each of the three conditions in fact often fails to hold. In order
to gauge the empirical importance of these failures, this paper examines
the statistical relationship between national saving and investment in
a sample that includes not only 14 industrialized countries, but also

50 developing countries. 2/ The paper addresses some of the econometric

critiques that have been aimed at the Feldstein—Horioka work. Contrary
to what one would expect if physical capital was mobile across countries,
the coefficient relating investment and national saving appears to be higher
for industrialized countries than for developing countries, and higher

after 1973 than before. Moreover, among developing countries there is a
clear difference in the behavior of domestic saving and investment rates
between countries that obtained external resources primarily through
international capital markets and those that receive substantial official

transfers. The saving and investment correlations for developing

countries that rely on international capital markets are difficult to
distinguish from industrial countries.

The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections.
Section I first considers the econometric problems associated with
examining the relationship between domestic saving and investment

ratios. Section II considers empirical results for saving and investment relationships for different groups of developed and developing

countries. Section III provides a rationale for the observed integration
of markets for some financial instruments and

the apparent isolation of

national markets for real saving and investment.

[I. Endogeneity of National Savings and Investment
One obvious version of the endogeneity problem that arises in time
series studies is the strongly procyclical nature of both saving and

investment, even when expressed as shares of GNP. If an exogenous boom
causes both to rise, we do not want to attribute the correlation to low

capital mobility. For this reason, Feldstein and Horioka restricted
their analysis to cross—section data, as did most who followed in their

footsteps. 1/ But even in time series studies, one can cyclically adjust
the saving and investment data. 2/

An alternative version of the problem that is relevant even for
cross—section studies is the fact that the saving and investment rates
both depend on the rate of growth of national income, as determined for
example by population growth or productivity growth. This problem is

1/ Other cross—section studies include Fieleke (1982), Feldstein (1983),
Penati and Dooley (1984), Murphy (1984), Caprio and Howard (1985), and
Summers (l985a).
2/ Sachs (1981) included a GNP gap variable in his regressions. Frankel
(1985) tried two approaches: decade
averages on a 10 year time sample of
U.S. data, and cyclically—adjusted annual saving and investment rates on
shorter postwar time samples. A third time—series study is Obstfeld (1985).

—6—
particularly relevant if the sample includes both industrialized countries

and developing countries. One solution that has been applied is to add
the rate of growth as a second explanatory variable.

But the finding has

been that holding the growth rate constant, like holding the business
cycle constant, does not reduce the coefficient in the saving—investment

regressions. 1/
The most popular version of the endogeneity critique is that governments react systematically to current account imbalances so as to offset

them. For example, if the government reacts to a trade deficit induced
by an increase in investment by cutting government

expenditure or rais-

ing taxes, then national saving and investment will be correlated for
reasons having nothing to do with capital mobility. 2/
It is important to realize how general the endogeneity argument is.
Any economic variable, in addition to the cost of capital that influences
the investment rate, will probably be correlated with the national saving

rate. This is true not just of the level of income, population growth,
and productivity growth, but also energy shocks, real wages, strikes, and

so forth. 3/ If factors, other than the cost of capital, that determine
1/ Fry (1984) and Summers (l985a) both argue, in the context of
developing countries in particular, that the influence of the growth
rate on the other two variables explains the saving—investment correlation. Obstfeld (1985) makes the argument carefully, in the context of
OECD countries. But Summers (l985a, p. 22) added the rates of population
growth and GNP growth to his regressions and found no effect on the
saving coefficient.
2/ The "policy reaction" argument has been made by Fieleke (1982),
Tobin (1983), Westphal (1983), Caprio and Howard (1984) and Summers
(l985a, b). Summers calls it the "maintained external balance"
hypothesis.
3/ Many of these factors would probably bias the correlation upward.
But some would go the opposite way, in the direction of a negative correlation. If a country discovers oil, investment should go up but saving
should go down. Similarly, an investment tax credit should raise investment but lower the budget surplus and therefore national saving.

—7—
investment happen to be uncorrelated with national saving, then there

will be no econometric problem. (This is true even if government policy
reacts systematically to current account imbalances.) But such a lack
of correlation, with or without t,erfect capital mobility, is an absurdly

strong condition. Since the difference between national

savings and

investment is identically equal to the current account it would imply
that the factor in question has the identical effect on the current
account as on investment.

If national saving depended on only the national rate of return and
other factors thought to be random (uncorrelated not only with the rate
of return but also with investment), we could invert the equation and

regress national saving against investment. The hypothesis that foreign
capital is in infinitely elastic supply at a given rate of return would

imply a zero coefficient. This test would be equivalent (given the
national saving identity) to regressing the current account against

investment. The null hypothesis would in that case be a unit coefficient, implying that any exogenous changes in investment are fully

financed by borrowing from abroad. This in fact is the equation run by
Sachs (1981, 1983). But the idea that the rate of return is the only
systematic determinant of both private and public saving has received
even less support than the analogous assumption for investment. Clearly
the right answer is that national saving, investment and the current
account are all endogenous, and that some covariance among these
variables is to be expected.
The question remains, however, as to why there is so little independent

variation among these variables. Surely some of the factors that influence

—8—
domestic savings do not have an equal and positive effect on investment.
Yet it is shown in the next section that a positive covariance "near" to
one is evident for very different country groups and over very different

time periods. Moreover, the country group with the lowest correlation is
also the group that relies the least on market—determined capital flows.
It follows that factors which generate high correlations between national
savings and investment in the presence of capital mobility must be
remarkably similar both across country groups and over long time periods.
It seems important therefore to confront the "endogeneity" problem
directly through an instrumental variables approach.

Indeed, the original

Feldstein and Horioka paper used instrumental variables. 1/ Two candidates for instruments for national savings are military expenditure and
the dependency ratio (the population less than 15 years or 65 years or
over in age, divided by the working age population in between). The
former is most immediately a determinant of the government budget deficit
(government dissavings) and the latter of private saving. It is possible
to think of ways that either could be endogenous; it is conceivable that
military expenditure could be cut back in response to trade deficits 2/
and that the age composition of the population could respond to the

growth rate. But these two variables seem to meet the criteria for

III. Results for the Relationship Between Investment
and National Saving
In this section, we examine the relationship between national saving,

defined to include both private and

public sector saving, and investment

for a sample composed of 14 industrial countries and 50 developing coun-

tries. 1/ Our first objective is to consider whether the empirical
results obtained for industrial

countries (e.g., Feldsteln and Horioka

(1980) and Penati. and Dooley (1984)) also extend to the developing coun-

tries, and whether the developing countries

can be treated as a homogenoug

group or differ according to the nature of the resource transfer they
receive from foreign sources.

Table 1 summarizes some of the empirical results based on ordinary
least squares regressions that have been obtained in past studies for
the savings and investment relationships for the industrial countries.

Three preliminary conclusions are evident in these results. First,
industrial countries that had relatively high rates of gross fixed
investment also had relatively high

gross domestic savings rates.

Second, examined over time, industrial

countries that accumulated capital

increases in
more rapidly in the most recent periods also experienced

saving as a share of GNP. However, conflicting evidence was developed
with regard to the relationship between investment ratios and current

account ratios. For example, Sachs (1981, 1983) found a negative and
significant slope coefficient in cross section regressions for either
the levels or changes in. current account balances and investment ratios.

Such a relationship would be consistent with a high degree of capital

mobility. In contrast, Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Penati and
Dooley (1984) did not find a significant negative

coefficient; as a

result, this evidence generally supports the view that changes in the
propensity to save or to invest of residents of an industrial country
were reflected in changes in that country's investment share or saving
share.

To examine whether such relationships exist for developing as well
as developed countries, our analysis first examines saving and invest—
ment behavior in these two groups of countries in two periods: 1960—73

and 1974—84. The first of these time periods represents the Bretton
Woods era of fixed exchange rates. It might be expected that the degree
of integration of markets for real savings and investment would be much
higher in the second period, as the largest industrialized countries
removed their capital controls, the OPEC surpluses were recycled, and
the EurocurrenCy markets experienced rapid growth.

coefficients are highly significant statistically. Moreover,

the coeff i—

cients are higher for the industrialized countries than for the developing
countries, although we find that the difference in these coefficients is
not statistically significant when the entire sample is pooled. This is

the same finding as Summers (1985a): there is no sign of the greater
ease that one would expect the more open industrialized countries to have

in financing saving shortfalls. Nor is there any sign of the expected
increase in capital mobility after 1973. The coefficient for all coun-

tries rises from 0.47 to 0.60. This failure of the coefficient to decline
over time is the same result found by Feldstein (1983) and Penati and
Dooley (1984, p. 9—10). 1/

These results are also supported by examining the relationship between
the changes in the average saving and investment ratios over the periods

1960—73 and 1974—84. As indicatedin Table 1, the slope coefficient
relating the change in the average investment to income ratios to the
change in the average savings to income ratio is positive and significant
(at the 99 percent level) for both industrial and developing countries
although the coefficient for the industrial countries is considerably
higher.

are approximately the same size and positive in both the OLS and instrumental variables equations, but the coefficient is not
different from zero in the

significantly

instrumental variables case. However for the

— 16 —

industrial

countries, the comparable savings coefficient rises quite

sharply in value but again becomes insignificant.
One possible explanation for these different results for industrial
and developing countries is that the set of 50 developing countries is
too diverse to treat as all having the same degree of capital mobility.
In Tables 4 and 5, we focus on the distinction between a group of 21
market borrowers and 14 countries that depend primarily on official

financing. (Fifteen countries are not classified by the Fund as either
sort of borrower.) In the OLS regressions (Table 4) the positive and
significant coefficients for the market borrowers, the official borrowers,
and the combined set of market and official borrowers that was evident

in Table 1 are still evident. Moreover, the coefficients are higher
after 1973 than before, and they are also higher for the market borrowers
than the official borrower.

The use of the instrumental variables technique

(Table 5) has a much

less important effect on the size and significance of the coefficients as
it did when all the developed countries were included together, especially

for the post—1973 period. For the market borrowers in particular, the
point estimate of the coefficient now even exceeds unity, as it did with
the industrialized countries in Table 2.
To sum up the results, the instrumental variables

estimation does

little to clear up the mysteries of the saving—investment correlations:

why they are so high generally, and why they are even higher for the
industrialized countries than for the developing countries, for the market
borrowers than for the official borrowers, and after 1973 than before.

IV.

Country Size and the Saving—Investment Correlation

We noted at the outset three conditions, all of which taken together
were sufficient if investment were to be uncorrelated with national

saving: (1) investment depends only on the national rate of return (and
purely random factors); (2) the domestic real rate of return equals the
world real rate of return; and (3) the world real rate of return is

exogenous. It was argued that, even if condition (2) holds, condition
(1) is very unlikely to hold since the gap between the domestic and world

rates of return may be affected by endogenous domestic factors. The
instrumental variable regressions are a way of attempting to deal with
the econometric problems created by such endogeneity.
The failure of condition 3 is another possible econometric problem

that has been pointed out by a number of authors. For a country large
enough to affect world financial market conditions, a fall in national
savings might drive up interest rates and crowd out investment everywhere

in the world. It would be erroneous to conclude from the fact that
domestic investment fell when domestic savings fell that there was low
capital mobility, if the rise in interest rates and fall in investment

were as large abroad as in the domestic country. This argument is of
particular interest here because it might seem to explain our findings in
Section III, that the saving investment coefficients appear to be higher

for industrialized countries (which of course tend to be larger in world
financial markets) than for developing countries.

— 23 —

Of the Feldstein—Horioka critiques, Murphy (1984) focuses most
explicitly on the failure of the world interest rate to be exogenous,
cov(r*, NS/Y)

0 in our equation (2). 1/ As a way of addressing the

effect of country size, he divides his sample of 17 OECD countries in
two, and finds that the seven large countries have a higher coefficient

on saving (0.98) than the ten small countries (0.59). He interprets the
results as supporting the claim that the high Feldstein—Horioka coeff i—

cients could be due to country size rather than to imperfect capital
mobility.

The argument is very relevant in the case of time series studies.
Obstfeld (1985), for example, attributes the high correlation coefficient
he gets for a U.S. time series to the size of the United States in world

narkets. As a fix—up, Tobin (1983) proposes including, in the equation
for any given country's investment, the saving rates for all the other
individual countries in the sample; he argues that under the hypothesis
of perfect capital mobility, a country's saving will have no more effect

on its own

investment

than on other countries' investment. 2/ This tech-

nique would use up too many degrees of freedom. But a natural solution is
to include the saving rates of the rest of the world aggregated. Frankel
(1985) converts the U.S. saving rate to deviations from the world saving
rate, converts the U.S. investment rate to deviations from the world

1/ Harberger (1980), Tobin (1983), and Obstfeld (1985) also criticized
Feldstein and Horioka on the grounds of the "large country" problem.
2/ Tobin acknowledges that the solution is relevant only for time
series studies, not cross—section, but he seems to believe that the
problem itself is relevant and serious even in cross—section studies.

— 24 —

investment rate, and finds that the two variables remain highly correlated. The argument is that if capital were perfectly mobile, and crowding out of investment were due only to the large size of the United States
in world capital markets, then there should be no effect of saving on the
U.S. investment rate beyond the effect on the rest of the world's invest-

ment rate. The rejection of this hypothesis suggests that the saving—
investment correlation cannot be attributed to the large country effect.
In cross section studies, the endogenous foreign interest rate r*

is not a problem to begin with. The statement, "a country's saving rate
affects r*," is a statement about alternative states of the world, as in

time series. It is not possible that cross—section effects on the saving
rate can be attributed to r*, for the simple reason that all countries

share the same r*. In equation (2), cov(r*, NS/Y) is necessarily zero
when r* is the same for every observation.
If one expressed national rates of saving and investment as deviations from world levels as in the time series regression, it would only

change the constant term in the cross—section regression. To take the
concrete example of the fall in the U.S. national savings rate in the
1980s, the large—country effect alone could in theory explain high real

interest rates and a depressing effect on U.S. investment. But if real
interest rates were equalized, the large—country effect alone could not
explain a combination of low saving and investment rates in the United
States together with simultaneous high saving and investment rates in
Japan.

— 25 —

Harberger (1983) offers an argument why the Feldstein results are
spurious that relies on the factor of country size, but in a way unrelated

to the endogeneity of the world interest rate. The argument is that
large countries tend to be more diverse than small countries (more like

U.S. states and less like city blocks, in Harberger's words). For this
reason, multiple saving and investment shocks tend to cancel out, and
there is proportionately less of a need for the country in the aggregate

to borrow or lend to the rest of the world. When there is a drought in
a small country, it affects the whole economy; the country has to borrow

from abroad. But when there is a drought in Kansas, there may be a good
harvest in California, or a high—tech boom in Massachusetts, or an oil
discovery in Alaska, so that there is proportionately less need for the

United States to borrow from abroad. The argument is analogous to the
optimum currency area literature of the early 1960s which relied on the
regularity that the larger and more economically diverse a region was,
the less need did it have (proportionately) for trade in labor or goods.

with other regions. 1/
Harberger (1983) specifically addresses the issue of industrialized
versus developing countries:

The point to be borne in mind here is that the evidence of the
Feldstein—Horioka paper was assembled from the OECD countries only.
Casting the net wider would have surely thrown up indications of
much greater divergence between saving and investment rates (p. 334).
Harberger's point is a convincing explanation of why current account!
GNP ratios such as calculated by him, Feldstein and Horioka (1980),

1/ It followed that if two regions joined together, the aggregate unit
would be less open than either taken individually. Mundell (1962) put
the argument in terms of labor mobility and McKinnon (1963) in terms of
openness to trade.

Feldstein

(1983), Sachs (1981, pp. 233—37), and Penati and Dooley (1984),

Caprio and Howard (1984), and Summers (1985), might be closer to zero

for large countries than for small countries. But it does not seem in
itself to explain why the investment—saving regression coefficient would

be higher for large countries than for small countries. If the variance
of the saving rate SlY (or of the investment rate disturbances) is smaller
for large countries because shocks cancel out, but changes in net capital
unit change in the current account are the same, then the

inflow

variance of the current account will also be smaller but the regression
coefficient need not be.

The last term is zero in large samples, in the event (extremely unlikely
without the use of instrumental variables, as we saw in Section III) that

the error term is well behaved. If Var(S/Y) and Var(s) are smaller
for large countries, then Var(CA/Y) will be smaller as well, as Harberger

claims. Nevertheless, a regression coefficient will be estimated as

where again the last term is zero in large samples in the event that the
error term is well behaved. The important point is that we should expect
to be no higher among large countries than among small countries. 1/
Murphy (1984) pursues Harberger's suggestion that one should find

more apparent capital mobility for smaller units than for large. He
regresses the investment rate against the saving rate for a cross section

of 143 U.S. corporations and finds a significant coefficient. He argues
that since the corporate capital market is "by almost all standards, a
well integrated capital market with a high degree of capital mobility,"

(p. 335), the correlation test must not be correct. But there is an
element of circularity to this argument. On the one hand, the proposed
explanation for the spurious Feldstein—Horioka results, an endogenous
market—wide interest rate, is not relevant for the cross—section of cor-

porations. On the other hand, there are perfectly good theoretical and
empirical reasons for thinking that corporations' liabilities are not, in
fact, perfect substitutes for each other in investors' portfolios and that
corporations cannot borrow unlimited amounts at the going interest rate.
We are left doubting the perfect integration of the corporate capital
market more than the reliability of the test.

V. Financial and Real Capital Mobility
In our view the evidence that levels and changes in national savings
and investment ratios move together stands up to the empirical issues

— 28 —

raised

in the previous sections. In terms of the three conditions laid

out at the beginning of this paper, it is the failure of the second
condition, r =

r*,

that remains the most likely explanation for the

position covariance of national savings and investment. One reason
why many observers continue to resist the implications of this evidence
is that it seems so clearly at odds with the apparent integration of
financial capital markets, especially those of developed countries.
If by capital mobility we mean the tendency for investors to equalize
expected rates of return on a subset of liquid, short—term, default—free,
financial assets denominated in different currencies or issued by residents
of different countries, then there can be little doubt that capital is

mobile among the major industrial countries. 1/ This definition of
capital mobility, however, is of limited value. It is analogous to
measuring the degree of integration of international goods markets by
noting that prices (measured in a common currency) are equalized for a

subset of goods. There certainly are a large number of agricultural and

1/ However it should be noted that, even if capital is sufficiently
mobile to equalize internationally expected rates of return on two assets,
the equalization will take place in terms of any common currency or
other numeraire, not in terms of the countries' respective goods. Thus,
real Interest parity, which is the condition relevant for saving and
investment, need not hold unless we have not only uncovered interest
parity, but also purchasing power parity. See Frankel (1985) for an
elaboration of this point.

— 29 —

mineral

commodities for which this condition holds quite strictly. It

is clear, however, that this condition tells us nothing about the tendency
of prices of goods in general to be equalized across countries.

In

fact, this more interesting purchasing power parity measure of "goods

mobility" has failed to hold in recent years. The key to this more
general condition is that within countries the relative prices of goods
change by substantial amounts and with no apparent tendency to return to
their original levels.

An analogous argument can be made in the context of international

markets for securities. The fact that a subset of financial instruments
issued by residents of different countries appear to be perfect substi-

tutes does not mean that the financial markets are fully integrated. As
is also true for goods markets, a useful measure of "capital mobility"
would require that "traded" and "nontraded" financial assets be perfect
substitutes in residents' portfolios so that the relative yields on
these assets within countries are largely independent of international
influences.

The existence of "nontraded" securities is, of course, not obvious.
It can be argued, however, that the possibility of ex post taxation of
some types of international positions acts as a barrier to trade in such

assets. Moreover, it is possible that the net indebtedness of a country
is an important determinant in its incentive to impose such taxes.
The idea that net claims on a given country might be important to

wealth holders is difficult to model. There is no aggregate asset called
"net claims" that we can identify nor can we directly measure the yield

— 30 —

necessary in order to induce wealth holders to hold this net position.
In most cases net claims on a given country are a small difference

between two large numbers, gross claims and gross liabilities. Thus
while it may be clear that a risk exists when a country's net debt to
the rest of the world grows it is not clear who holds that risk, that
is, how a loss would be allocated among holders of various financial
claims on the country.

The government, for example, may perceive different costs in

damaging the reputation of various forms of investments. Its own securities might be an example of an asset unlikely to be taxed, particularly

if these are held by foreign governments. Equity claims, however, might
be relatively easy to identify as owned by nonresidents and, because
they impart control of domestic firms, constitute a relatively attractive
tax base for political reasons.

If assets such as Treasury securities and equity claims are
imperfect substitutes within countries the structure of yields between
countries and within countries will reflect a complex set of expectations
concerning the likely incidence of an ex post tax on nonresident claims

as well as "arbitrage" conditions that will determine how and by whom
such risks are borne.

It follows that arbitrage among a select set of internationally
traded "safe" financial assets need not imply that yields on more

vulnerable nontraded assets are also equalized. What is necessary is
that differentials that might arise within a country are not closely

arbitraged. That is, the yields on Treasury securities and other

— 31

tradable

—

securities would have to diverge from yields on equities and

other nontradable assets. The analogy in goods markets would be that
prices of traded goods are equalized across countries but the relative
prices of traded and nontraded goods within countries will change in
response to economic conditions.

This framework might be made more clear by illustrating the financial

and real linkages between and within two very simple economies. Financial
assets consist of claims on physical capital, E, interest—bearing claims

on the government, B, and fiat money, M. The yield on equity claims is
the marginal revenue product of the capital stock, r. Interest—bearing

government bonds yield a nominal rate of rp and fiat money, which
is also a liability of the governments, yields no nominal return.

In describing the linkages between the two countries' financial
systems it is assumed that government bonds are traded securities while

equity claims are nontraded securities. As with goods and services the
terms traded and nontraded securities are an analytical convenience that

represents a continuum of assets. For simplicity it is assumed that
government—issued securities are perfect substitutes across countries so
that

each country are as follows. Real investment is defined as transforming
current output into a capital good which has an "own" rate of return in

terms of future output. Investment will be positive when the present
value of the expected future output exceeds the cost of the capital.
As discussed above, the discount rate,

need not be equal to the

government security rate since domestic savers might require a variable
differential in order to hold willingly existing government debt and
claims on the capital stock.

1/ In terms of the literature we are thus assuming "perfect capital
mobility" but no currency substitution. Note however, that the addition of nontraded securities to the model will alter the "standard"
interpretation of "capital mobility" as defined by (4).

Savings in each country is a function of two independent rates of
return, the two government bond yields (which are assumed equal because
of arbitrage across countries) and the yield on the domestic capital
stock.

(6) S =

S(r,

rg)

The real sector linkages between countries are derived from the

above conditions and the balance of payments constraint. That is, a
net excess demand for the traded security must be identically equal

to the differences between output and absorption (or public plus private

savings and investment) in each country. The mechanism that insures this
equality is left in the background. It may or may not involve income,
prices and real exchange rate changes, which are assumed unchanged in
this discussion.

The essential features of this framework are illustrated below

(Figure 1). Because these relations are drawn with respect to returns on
traded securities, the yield on nontraded securities, rp, is a parameter

in the savings and investment functions. Since government bonds are

perfect substitutes across countries, rg and rg* are always equal. In
the initial position, domestic savings for both countries are set equal to

domestic investment plus the domestic fiscal deficit at r by assumption.
It is evident that shifts in the 1, 1* or S, S functions, or a
change in either countries' fiscal deficit, will result in some net trade
of government bonds and a current account imbalance in this framework.

But there is no presumption that this trade in tlsafe!I securities will be

sufficient to equalize r and r. In general the disturbance in this
model will be dissipated by both a change in the structure of yields,
savings and investment behavior within countries, and net trades of goods

and securities between countries. The relative importance of these
equilibrating mechanisms depends on the degree of segmentation of financial markets, the response of savings and investment to the two financial
yields, and the nature of the shock to the system.
Suppose in this system the domestic fiscal deficit increases (due to
a bond financed increase in government expenditures), shifting the I + G
curve to the right to I + G' (Figure 1). In autarky rg would be bid
up, and if rp was bid up only slightly, so that shifts in I and S were

negligible, r would rise to r. If we now open the economy, and
assume that r is about unchanged, r will also be bid up and the new

— 35 —

equilibrium

will be at r =

r2.

At this point the traded security

yields will have risen sufficiently to increase S + S so that the
domestic fiscal deficit is covered. This will generate a current account
deficit in the home country, a b, equal to the difference between domestic
savings and I + G', and a current account surplus, c d, in the foreign

country. There is an equivalent net trade of government securities.
If we assume that the financial markets are highly integrated within
each country, a rise in rg =

rg* will tend also to raise r and r. In

this case the S and S curves in Figure 1 would shift to the right and the
I + G' and 1* +

curves would shift to the left as private investment

is crowded out. If the two countries were identical, the rise in rg =
would be less but we would observe the same current account deficit
following a fiscal deficit as described above.

A shift in the investment schedule or the saving schedule would
differ in at least one important respect from the fiscal deficit shock

discussed above. Assume that the private investment function shifts to
the right by the same amount as the fiscal deficit discussed above so

that I ÷ G shifts to I' + G (Figure 2). The effects of such a shift

appear to be similar as described above in that r =

would rise

However, in this case the shift in the domestic investment function would
tend to raise rp directly and this would shift II +

G

to I" + C.

More-

over, the rise in rp would cause S S in Figure 2 to shift to the right

to S' S'. For these reasons an ex ante shift in the domestic investment
schedule would have a smaller effect on the traded securities market

shown as shown by the dashed curves in Figure 2. The initial disequilibrium in the domestic traded securities market would be mitigated by a

rise in rp. It follows that the size of the shock transmitted to the
other country is smaller as compared to a fiscal deficit if the domestic

financial market is poorly integrated. For this reason the current
account imbalance would also be smaller.
In general, it apears that a more complete description of the
linkages among financial markets within and between countries might
help to explain the correlations between domestic savings and domestic

— 37 —

investment.

The very simple model proposed above suggests that these

correlations should break down in cases where the dominant shocks to the
system are unusually large fiscal deficits that are uncorrelated across

countries. In the absence of such conditions, differences or changes in
domestic savings and investment functions might have limited impact on
current account imbalances.

VI. Concluding Remarks
The evidence brought together in this paper suggests to the authors
that a close association between national savings and national investment

is a robust empirical regularity. This finding casts considerable doubt
on the widely held view that national markets for physical capital are

highly integrated. The positive correlations between levels and changes
in national saving rates and investment rates, which are apparent both
for industrial countries and developing countries and which are higher
in recent years as compared to earlier time periods, stand up to a

variety of econometric objections. The only data set for which the
empirical regularity is not apparent includes developing countries that
depend primarily on aid to finance current account imbalances.

The fact that national markets for some types of financial capital
are integrated may be irrelevant in evaluating the degree of integration

of national markets for physical capital. The tendency for expected
returns on liquid, default free financial assets to be equalized does not
imply that expected returns on physical capital are also equalized.

— 38 —

We

do not know why the apparent isolation of national markets for

physical capital has persisted in the face of substantial expansion of

trade in goods and services and financial capital. Further research into
these matters might focus on the impediments to net transfers of real

savings to "foreign" political jurisdictions. A better understanding of
such factors might suggest policy measures that would encourage more
productive use of world savings.
