Capital Accumulation and Annuities in an Adverse Selection Economy

ABSTRACT

This paper suggests that adverse selection problems in competitive annuity

markets can generate quantity constrained equilibria in which some agents
whose length of' lifetime is uncertain find it advantageous to accumulate
capital privately.

This occurs despite the higher rates of return on

annuities. The welfare properties of these allocations are analyzed.

It is

shown that the level of capital accumulation is excessive in a Paretian
sense. Policies which eliminate this inefficiency are discussed.

Introduction

This paper investigates the nature of annuity markets and the
composition of private portfolios when there exists cx ante private
information

existence

regarding individual specific survival probabilities. The
of such private information leads to equilibrium annuity

contracts which constrain subsets of agents with respect to the quantity

annuities that they can purchase. When the magnitude of agents'
investments in some non—annuity type asset is non—observable, these

of

quantity constraints may be sufficiently binding to lead sane agents who

do not have bequest motives to finance a portion of their old age
consumption via bequeathable wealth. This can occur despite the fact that
the equilibrium rate of return on bequeathable wealth is lower than the
equilibrium rate of return on annuities • Given uncertain lifetimes, the
voluntary private accumulation of bequeathable wealth generates
involuntary bequests.

In contrast to Kotlikoff and

convenience and because the qualitative features of our results will be

robust to the inclusion of standard types of bequest motives (see for
example Barro (1974), Shezhinski and Weiss (1981) and Abel (1984)). It is

true that if agents had bequest motives, not all intergenerational
transfers would be involuntary.

However some individuals would still be

quantity—constrained with respect to annuity purchases so that some
personal

consumption would be financed from bequeathable wealth.

Put

somewhat differently, bequeathable wealth uld not be held solely for
bequest purposes • This is consistent with findings by Diamond and Hausman

(1982), King and Dicks—Mirseaux (1982), Bernheim (1984) and Bernheim,
Shleifer and Sunmers (1985) which imply

type assets in order to finance their consumption.

Such

behavior is inconsistent with models in which agents can purchase, without

quantity constraints, actuarially fair annuities, regardless of whether or
not they have standard types of bequest motives.

It is convenient to divide annuity contract equilibria into one of

The fact that some agents may choose to finance second period
consumption by holding bequeathable wealth follows from the nature of the

equilibrium annuity contracts. In particular, as Theorem 1 indicates, the

competitive provision of annuities guarantees that agents with high
survival

probabilities will not be constrained regarding annuity

purchases. However, agents with low survival probabilities may be
sufficiently constrained with respect to annuity purchases that they find

necessarily the case for group A, since q&(W...SH,SH6/u) may be positive.

Hence, because of quantity rationing in the group A equilibrium annuity

contract, the members of that group may hold positive quantities of t
distinct assets, one of which has a higher rate of return from their point
of view. This possibility is depicted in Figure 1, where the members of
group A attain the allocation H' by storing privately from H. Put
differently, the members of group A may hold capital and annuities even in
the absence of bequest motives.

and sufficient conditions for the existence of an El equilibrium.

begin with. It follo that the members of group B prefer the pooling
contract even if they cannot engage in private storage.
Thus, the
observability of private non—annuity type assets suffices to eliminate
to

private capital accumulation (and involuntary bequests) when there is an
E2 pooling equilibrium in annuity markets. However the equilibrium

pooling annuity contract itself does

not

change.

Instead, the

observabi],jty of private storage simply eliminates the ability of certain
agents to engage in additional. non—insurance savings activities.

Consider next the situation depicted in Figure 1, in bthich the
separating equilibrium with unobservable storage involves the holding of
bequeathable wealth by the members of group A. In that equilibrium
private holding of capital allows the members of group A to increase their

utility by moving from allocation H to allocation H'.

In order to be

incentive compatible, the equilibrium group A annuity contract must have

the property that the final group B allocation obtainable from it lies

on

the indifference curve (labelled 'B in Figure 1) passing through the group
B annuity contract. Thus, when storage is observable, the binding

constraint on group A's final allocation is that it lies along

13.

From

group A's point of view the best actuarially fair allocation on that curve
is denoted by the point G. An annuity contract attaining allocation G may

require the imposition of no private storage in order to be incentive
compatible.

Such a constraint on private savings may be binding for the
members of both groups at allocation G. However, this constrained annuity

contract is still preferred by the members of group A to any other

type assets are observable.

In concluding this section we briefly consider an additional market

that is made possible when agents with uncertain lifetimes hold capital.

Specifically, suppose that in the first period of their lives, agents
issue claims to one unit of the consumption good, redeemable in the second

period only if the issuer of the claim is not alive. Since the level of
private capital holdings, which backs such claims, is not observable in

the first period, the supply of these claims will be infinite at any
positive price. It is possible, however, to get around this difficulty by
considering the following extended annuity contract. In addition to a

first period contribution level and .a rate of return payable if

the

annuity holder is alive in the second period • the purchaser of the annuity

agrees to preocit ownership of his private capital holdings —— whatever
they may be —to the annuity issuer if he dies in the second period. This

precoemitment of estates potentially allowe for rates of return in excess
of group specific actuarially fair rates. If the equilibrium turns out to
be a separating one, then this extension is superfluous; the group B
contract makes private capital holdings unattractive for members of

that

grotç, but the implied incentive compatibility constraint prevents any
improvement in the rates of return for group A. Moreover, without cross
subsidization of contracts across different groups, precommitment of
estates

by members of group A cannot be used to improve the terms of group

B contracts •

On

the other hand, the nature of

the

pooling equilibrium may

12

change as a result of introducing this type of extended annuity contract.
In particular, the rate of return payable on annuity investments will be
higher than ! if the members of group B choose to hold capita]. privately.
In this case, private capital acci.anulation by the members of group B does

to involuntary bequests. Instead, their estates revert to
annuity issuers and are re—distributed, in the form of higher rates of
return on annuities, to the surviving members of groups A and B.
