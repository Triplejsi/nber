The Biocultural Origins of Human Capital Formation

JEL No. J10,N30,O10
ABSTRACT
This research explores the biocultural origins of human capital formation. It presents the first evidence
that moderate fecundity and thus predisposition towards investment in child quality was conducive
for long-run reproductive success within the human species. Using an extensive genealogical record
for nearly half a million individuals in Quebec from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, the study
explores the effect of fecundity on the number of descendants of early inhabitants in the subsequent
four generations. The research exploits variation in the random component of the time interval between
the date of first marriage and the first birth to establish that while higher fecundity is associated with
a larger number of children, an intermediate level maximizes long-run reproductive success. Moreover,
the observed hump-shaped effect of fecundity on long-run reproductive success reflects the negative
effect of higher fecundity on the quality of each child. The finding further indicates that the optimal
level of fecundity was below the population median, lending credence to the hypothesis that during
the Malthusian epoch, the forces of natural selection favored individuals with lower fecundity and
thus larger predisposition towards child quality, contributing to human capital formation, the onset
of the demographic transition and the evolution of societies from an epoch of stagnation to sustained
economic growth.

Introduction

The transition from an epoch of stagnation to an era of sustained economic growth has triggered one
of the most significant transformations in the course of human history. While living standards in
the world economy stagnated during the millennia preceding the Industrial Revolution, income per
capita has experienced an unprecedented twelvefold increase over the past two centuries, profoundly
altering the level and distribution of education, health, and wealth across the globe.1
Over most of human existence, the process of development was marked by Malthusian stagnation. The Malthusian pressure has governed the evolution of the size of the population, and conceivably, via the forces of natural selection, has shaped the composition of the population as well.
Lineages of individuals whose traits were complementary to the economic environment generated
higher income, and thus higher reproductive success. The gradual increase in the representation
of these growth-enhancing traits in the population presumably has contributed to the process of
development and the take-o↵ from stagnation to growth (Galor, 2011).2
In particular, it was hypothesized that during the Malthusian epoch, natural selection brought
about a gradual increase in the representation of traits associated with predisposition towards
o↵spring quality in the population. The e↵ect of this evolutionary process on investment in human
capital stimulated technological progress and contributed to the reinforcing interaction between
investment in human capital and technological progress that triggered the demographic transition
and brought about a state of sustained economic growth (Galor and Moav, 2002).
This research explores the biocultural origins of human capital formation. It presents the first
evidence that moderate fecundity and thus predisposition towards investment in child quality was
conducive for long-run reproductive success within the human species. It further suggests that individuals with lower levels of fecundity than the median in the population generated an evolutionary
advantage in the pre-demographic transition era. These findings lend credence to the hypothesis
that during the Malthusian epoch, natural selection favored individuals with lower fecundity and
thus larger predisposition towards child quality, contributing to human capital formation, the onset of the demographic transition and the evolution of societies from an epoch of stagnation to
sustained economic growth.3
1

The transition from stagnation to growth and the associated divergence of income per capita across the globe
have been the subject of intensive research in the growth literature in recent years (Galor and Weil, 1999, 2000; Galor
and Moav, 2002; Hansen and Prescott, 2002; Lucas, 2002; Galor, 2011).
2
Evidence suggests that the composition of existing genetic traits may experience rapid evolutionary processes.
Voight et al. (2006) detected about 700 regions of the human genome where genes have been reshaped by natural
selection within the last 5,000 to 15,000 years. Other notable evidence suggests that lactose tolerance was developed
among Europeans and Near Easterners since the domestication of dairy animals in the course of the Neolithic
revolution, whereas in regions that were exposed to dairy animals in later stages, a larger proportion of the adult
population su↵ers from lactose intolerance. Furthermore, genetic immunity to malaria provided by the sickle cell
trait is prevalent among descendants of Africans whose engagement in agriculture improved the breeding ground for
mosquitoes and thereby raised the incidence of malaria, whereas this trait is absent among descendants of nearby
populations that have not made the transition to agriculture (Livingstone, 1958; Wiesenfeld, 1967; Durham, 1982).

The interaction between human evolution and the process of development, as was further explored theoretically
by Galor (2005); Lagerlöf (2007); Dalgaard and Strulik (2011); Galor and Michalopoulos (2012), is applicable to either
cultural or genetic intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurial traits (Cavalli-Sforza, 1981; Boyd, 1988; Weibull,

The influential life-history theory in the field of evolutionary biology suggests that observed
fecundity of organisms reflects a trade-o↵ in reproductive success between the quantity and quality
of o↵spring, given the evolutionary history of the organism. Central to the theory is the supposition that there exists an optimal level of fecundity beyond which fitness diminishes.4 A negative
association between the quantity and the quality of o↵spring has been documented in a wide variety of species, ranging from plants to humans. In particular, researchers uncovered an inverse
relationship between the number of seeds and their size as well as between the quantity and quality of o↵spring within and across mammals.5 Moreover, a trade-o↵ between fertility on the one
hand and o↵spring survival probability and education on the other hand has been documented for
pre-industrial human societies.6
Nevertheless, the presence of a static trade-o↵ between the quantity and quality of o↵spring is
merely a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the presence of an adverse e↵ect of fecundity
on reproductive success in the long run. In particular, a priori, during the Malthusian epoch
individuals with the highest level of fecundity could have had the largest reproductive success if for
any feasible number of children, an additional child would have contributed directly to the number
of o↵spring in the long-run more than the adverse indirect e↵ect of this additional child on the
quality of hence the reproductive success of these children.7
This research explores the e↵ect of fecundity on long-run reproductive success within the human
species. Using an extensive genealogical record for nearly half a million individuals in Quebec
between the 16th and the 18th centuries, the study examines the e↵ect of fecundity on the number
of descendants of early inhabitants of this Canadian province in the subsequent four generations. In
particular, in light of the social norm observed in pre-industrial Quebec, in which marriage marked
the intention to conceive, the research exploits variation in the random component of the time
interval between the date of first marriage and the first birth during this time period to capture the
e↵ect of fecundity on fitness. The research establishes that while higher fecundity is associated with
a larger number of children, an intermediate level of fecundity is conducive for long-run reproductive
success.
The research finds that the maximal reproductive success is attained by couples with a moderate
level of time to first birth (i.e., those whose first delivery occurs 65 weeks after their marriage, in
comparison to a sample median of 53 weeks). In particular, in comparison to highly fertile couples
whose first child is born 38 weeks after the marriage, those individuals have on average 0.3 fewer
children, but 0.6 more grandchildren, 9.5 additional great-grandchildren, and 15 added great-greatgrandchildren (in comparison to a sample mean of 294). In light of the heritability of fecundity, the

on comparative development have been established by Galor and Moav (2007); Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009); Ashraf
and Galor (2013); Ashraf et al. (2014).

Furthermore, few attempts to examine the related phenomenon of the e↵ect of the number of children on fitness
are largely inconclusive (Kaplan et al., 1995; Borgerho↵ Mulder, 2000).

2

finding that the optimal level of time to first birth is above the population median suggests that
in pre-industrial Quebec, the representation of individuals with lower levels of fecundity, and thus
higher pre-disposition towards child quality, has gradually increased in the population.8
The research identifies several mechanisms that had contributed to the trade-o↵ associated with
higher fecundity and to the observed hump-shaped e↵ect of fecundity on reproductive success in
the long run. While individuals with lower fecundity had fewer children, the observed hump-shaped
e↵ect of fecundity on long-run reproductive success reflects the adverse e↵ect of fecundity on the
quality of each child. In particular individuals with lower fecundity were more likely to have children
that: (i) survived and got married, (ii) married at an earlier age, and (iii) were educated. Thus,
despite the positive e↵ect of fecundity on the number of children, the adverse e↵ect of fecundity
on child quality and the reproductive success of each child, generated the observed hump shaped
relationship between fecundity and long-run reproductive success.
The evidence from pre-industrial Quebec suggests that the forces of natural selection favored
individuals characterized by moderate fecundity,, increasing the population’s predisposition towards
investment in child quality. Interestingly, the conditions that were faced by the founder population
of Quebec during this high fertility time period resemble the environment that anatomically modern
humans confronted during their migration out of Africa, as they settled new territories where the
carrying capacity of the new environment was an order of magnitude greater than the size of the
founder population. Thus, the findings support the hypothesis that during the Malthusian epoch,
natural selection favored individuals with a larger predisposition towards child quality, contributing
to human capital formation, the onset of the demographic transition and the evolution of societies
from an epoch of stagnation to sustained economic growth.

2

Empirical Strategy

Two major obstacles a↵ect the identification of the e↵ect of fecundity on long-run reproductive
success. First, omitted correlates of the quantity of children may also be correlated with their
quality, obscuring the e↵ect of the nubmer of children on long-run reproductive success. For instance, if variations in resources across individuals (e.g., income) enable some parents to produce
more children as well as higher quality children, failing to account for the e↵ect of resources will
obscure the e↵ect of child quantity on long-run reproductive success. In particular, an observed
monotonically positive relationship between the number of children and that of grandchildren may
misleadingly be interpreted as indicative of a lack of an optimal level of quantity beyond which
fitness diminishes.
Second, reverse causality from the quality of children to their aggregate quantity may obscure
the presence or the absence of an optimal level of fecundity beyond which fitness diminishes. For
instance, the adverse e↵ect of low child quality on the child survival rate may contribute to the
total number of children born (via the child replacement channel), generating a negative correlation
8
For the heritability of fecundity, see Christensen et al. (2003); Pettay et al. (2005); Ramlau-Hansen et al. (2008);
Kosova et al. (2009). In the Quebec sample the time from marriage to first birth is heritable (h2 = 0.04).

Weeks from marriage to first birth
Figure 1: The histogram depicts the durations (in weeks) from first marriages to first births of
53,154 mothers in Quebec between the 16th and the end of the 18th century who gave birth
between the 7th and 728th day of their marriage date.
between the long-run reproductive success and the quantity of o↵spring that has no bearing on the
presence or the absence of an optimal level of quantity beyond which fitness diminishes.
This research mitigates these major hurdles by focusing on the e↵ect of fecundity, rather than
fertility, on reproductive success. Furthermore, it designs an empirical strategy that exploits the
inherent uncertainty in the process of human reproduction to identify the e↵ect of fecundity on
reproductive success. In particular, in light of the social norm observed in pre-industrial Quebec,
in which marriage marked the intention to conceive, the research exploits variation in the random
component of the time interval between the date of first marriage and the first birth to capture the
e↵ect of fecundity on fitness.
As depicted in Figure 1, a marriage over this period signaled a deliberate attempt to conceive.
A sharp spike in birth rates occurs starting in the 35th week after marriage and nearly a third
of births occurs within the 36–44 weeks time interval.9 Furthermore, premarital conception is
insignificant, reflecting possibly an adherence to the social and religious norms existing at the time.
9

Full term babies are born upon 38 weeks of gestation. Nevertheless, pregnancy is considered at term if the
gestation period is within the interval 36-40 weeks. However, since the marriage age may coincide with the ovulation
period and may occur at most 4 weeks before it, time to first birth within the interval 36–44 weeks would correspond
to babies born at term.

4

In particular, only 7.9 percent of the births over this period occurred within 35 weeks of marriage,
and the incidence of premature births suggests that even this small fraction overstates the share of
babies conceived prior to marriage.10
Since fecundity reflects genetic and socio-environmental factors, the time interval between
the date of first marriage and the first birth (TFB) is a↵ected by genetic predisposition, socioenvironmental conditions, as well as the realization of random elements that a↵ect conception.
Accounting for a range of genetic and socio-environmental confounding factors that may a↵ect the
time to first birth, reproductive success, and the quality of o↵spring, the study attempts to isolate
the e↵ect of the random variations in TFB across individuals. In particular, genetic, as well as
cultural and socio-economic factors that may a↵ect fecundity are accounted for by the inclusion of
Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects. Namely, the e↵ect of fecundity on reproductive success is identified
based on variations in reproductive success among siblings, capturing the similarities in the genetic
predisposition of these genetically linked individuals, as well as their cultural and socio-economic
proximity.
Additional confounding variations between siblings are accounted for by the inclusion of dummies for their marriage age, birth year, gender, and literacy. Furthermore, additional control
variables include the geographic location at birth and death, birth order, month of birth, month of
birth of the firstborn, number of marriages, and immigration and emigration status of the spouse,
for each head of lineage.
Finally, to assure the external validity of the empirical analysis for significant evolutionary patterns in fecundity during most of human existence, the research focuses on this evolutionary process
among the founder population of Quebec during the pre-industrial, pre-demographic transition era
– a high fertility environment that had naturally led to rapid evolutionary changes in the composition of the population. The conditions that were faced by the founder population of Quebec during
that time period capture the environment that anatomically modern humans confronted during
their migration out of Africa, as they settled new territories where the carrying capacity of the new
environment was an order of magnitude greater than the size of the founder population. Thus, the
evolution in fecundity in Quebec during this time period is likely to capture the dominating trend
in this evolutionary process during the Malthusian epoch as a whole.

Data and Main Variables

This section sets the stage for the empirical examination of the hypothesis that higher fecundity
in the pre-demographic transition era was associated with a larger number of children, while an
intermediate level of fecundity maximized long-run reproductive success.

10

In the sample of all 59,238 mothers, 3.2 percent of births occurred prior to the marriage date, 5.5 percent of
the births occurred after two years and 38 weeks of marriage (i.e., two years after first conception), and 1.6 percent
of births occurred within one week of marriage (reflecting possibly a tendency of mothers who gave birth before
marriage to baptize their firstborn at or shortly after their wedding date).

3.1

Data

The data is based on the demographic history of Quebec, using the reconstructed genealogy of
the entire parish registers of Quebec, covering 471,412 individuals born between 1572 and 1799,
spanning the French settlement and colonization of Quebec.11 The data covers all parishes of
Quebec, and thus in light of negligible inter-provincial migration, intra-provincial migration does
not prevent the tracking of reproductive success of individuals over several generations. Indeed,
more than 94% of these individuals were born and died in Quebec.
The analysis focuses on the reproductive success of individuals who were born in Quebec prior to
and including 1685, died in the province, and had at least one great-great grandchild.12 The focus
on the reproductive success of heads of lineages born prior to and including 1685 permits tracing
of most descendants of these individuals in the subsequent four generations, while accounting for
the Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects.13
Furthermore, immigrants among heads of lineages are excluded from the sample for two reasons.
First they may di↵er systematically from natives, reflecting the circumstances that led to their
decision to immigrate as well as the e↵ects of immigration on their socio-economic status and thus
their reproductive success. Second, reproduction of immigrants prior to their arrival to Quebec is
unknown. Similarly, emigrants are excluded as well since they may possess unique attributes and
their subsequent marriages and births outside of Quebec are not observed.
The study focuses on individuals whose time from first marriage to first birth is at least 38
weeks.14 Moreover, the study follow the convention in the literature (e.g. Milot et al. (2011)) and
restricts the sample to individuals whose time to first conception is less than 2 years (i.e., TFB less
than 2 years and 38 weeks), excluding 10.9% of this subset.15 This further restriction is designed to
mitigate the e↵ect of extreme values of time to first birth which may reflect measurement errors or
underlying biological conditions that may directly a↵ect long-run reproductive success. Thus the
analysis focuses on the reproductive success of 3,798 heads of lineages in the pre-1685 period that
satisfy the entire sample restrictions.16
11

The data is provided by Le Programme de recherche en démographie historique at the University of Montreal.
All children of these heads of lineages, virtually all grandchildren, and most of the descendants in the third and
the fourth generations are observed. In particular, fewer than 2.5% of the head of lineages that satisfy the sample
selection criteria produced a birth after age 60, implying that fewer than 0.1% of lineages produced a grandchild after
115 years. Systematic association between the birth year of the head of the lineage and the number of unobserved
descendants in the third and fourth generations are accounted for by the inclusion dummies for the birth year of the
heads of lineages.
13
The use of alternative time intervals would not a↵ect the qualitative results. In particular, as established in
Tables 3 and 4, the main results are qualitatively unchanged if the analysis focuses on the reproductive success of
heads of lineages born: (i) in 1660–1685 or (ii) over the entire sample period.
14
For the 8.2 percent of the individuals in the sample of non-migrating heads of lineages whose firstborn’s date of
birth is unknown, it is estimated to be one week prior to the date of baptism.
15
The use of alternative cut-o↵s would not a↵ect the qualitative results. In particular, focusing on individuals
whose time from first marriage to first birth is at least 36 weeks, the hump-shaped relationship remains highly
significant. Likewise, focusing on individuals whose time from first marriage to first birth is at least 40 weeks, the
hump-shaped relationship remains significant. Furthermore, exploiting alternative estimation methods that do not
rely on a quadratic specification reveals qualitatively similar patterns in the presence of observations with TFB
exceeding 2 years and 38 weeks.
16
The summary statistics for this sample can be found in Table A.1.

Main Variables
Dependent and Independent Variables

In the main analysis that explores the e↵ect of the time interval between the first marriage date
of the head of a lineage and the birth date of the individual’s first child (TFB) on reproductive
success, the dependent variable is the number of o↵spring of each head of lineage in the subsequent
four generations (i.e., children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren).
In the additional analysis that examines the mechanism through which TFB a↵ects long-run reproductive success, the dependent variables are the fraction of ever-married children among children
observed to have survived to age 40, the average marriage age of children with observed marriage
age, and the fraction of literate children among children with observed literacy status (recorded at
marriage). The independent variable throughout the analysis is the time interval between the first
marriage date of the head of a lineage and the birth date of the individual’s first child (TFB).17
3.2.2

Maternal Founder Fixed E↵ects

The e↵ect of fecundity on reproductive success may be a↵ected by variation in genetic predisposition among genetically distinct individuals, as well as variation in cultural and socio-economic
background. Hence, similarities in the genetic, cultural, and socio-economic characteristics across
siblings within each household are exploited to isolate the e↵ect of random variation in TFB on
reproductive success. Accounting for Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects, as well as the confounding
factors underlined below, the analysis explores the e↵ect of random variation in TFB on long-run
reproductive success within lineages headed by siblings, as opposed to across all heads of lineages.18
3.2.3

Control Variables

The analysis accounts for the confounding e↵ects of the marriage age, birth year, literacy, and the
maternal identity, for each head of lineage. Furthermore, additional control variables include the
geographic location at birth and death, birth order, month of birth, month of birth of the firstborn,
number of marriages, and immigration and emigration status of the spouse, for each head of lineage.
The confounding associations between the marriage age of heads of lineages and their a✏uence,
fecundity, and reproduction is accounted for by the inclusion of dummy variables indicating the
17
In couples where neither spouse remarried, TFB is identical for the husband and the wife. Nevertheless, given
that the frequency of remarriage over this period is substantial, reflecting in part a considerable mortality rate, TFB
and the number of o↵spring of each spouse often di↵er. The correlation in reproductive success between parents
sharing the same firstborn, and therefore the same TFB, is accounted for by clustering the standard errors for heads
of lineages sharing the same firstborn.
18
Accounting for the family characteristics of the spouse of the head of dynasties would restrict the sample for
siblings who married siblings from a di↵erent household. Accounting for these fixed e↵ects would reduce the sample
size by more than 90%, and more importantly, would introduce biases associated with the unique characteristics of
these families and their matching technology. Reassuringly however, the Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects do accounts
for the characteristics of the spouses of heads of households in the likely scenario of non-random (assortative) mating.
Moreover, since the regression analysis is nearly una↵ected by the introduction of Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects, the
potential e↵ect of random mating does not compromise the analysis and further control for fixed factors in the family
of the spouse of the head of lineage are unlikely to alter the results.

marriage age of heads of lineages. The marriage age is associated with reproductive success through
three channels. First, fecundity is a↵ected by age (Baird et al., 2005). Second, the marriage
age a↵ects the length of the reproductive period of the couple. Third, in the pre-demographic
transition era that corresponds to our sample, the marriage age was inversely related to the a✏uence
of individuals, and marriage age and its potential association with a✏uence could have had an
independent e↵ect on long-run reproductive success.
The time-path of socioeconomic and demographic factors may di↵erentially a↵ect fecundity and
reproductive success across cohorts of heads of lineages. In particular, the a✏uence, fecundity, and
reproductive success of heads of lineages may be a↵ected by the socioeconomic and demographic
conditions during their lifetime, as partly captured by their birth year. These confounding factors are accounted for by the inclusion of dummy variables indicating the birth year of heads of
lineages.19
The human capital attainment that may reflect the socioeconomic status of heads of lineages
may a↵ect their TFB and reproductive success. This confounding factor is partly accounted for by
the inclusion of the literacy status of heads of lineages, inferred from the existence of a signature
(rather than a mark) on the marriage certificate. Additional confounding variations between heads
of lineages are accounted for by the inclusion of dummies capturing gender, geographic location at
birth and death, birth order, month of birth, month of birth of the firstborn, number of marriages,
and immigration and emigration status of the spouse.
Finally, variations in socioeconomic and physiological factors across heads of lineages may generate variation in the length of the reproductive period that may obscure the e↵ect of TFB on
reproduction. In particular, conditional on the marriage age, the age at last delivery determines
the length of the reproductive period. Hence, to account for the potential e↵ect of the stoppage
age, the analysis is shown to be robust to the inclusion of dummy variables indicating the stoppage
age of heads of lineages, in addition to the marriage age, are introduced to account for this confounding factors, permitting the study to capture the e↵ects of TFB on fertility, for a given length
or reproductive period.20

Empirical Analysis

This section examines the proposed hypothesis that higher fecundity in the pre-demographic transition era was associated with a larger number of children, while an intermediate level of fecundity
maximized long-run reproductive success. The examination proceeds in two stages. The empirical
regularities that emerge from the data are examined initially semi-parametrically, using cubic spline
regression models, followed by an examination using OLS regressions models.

19

In addition, the inclusion of birth year dummies mitigates the potential systematic associations between the
birth year and the number of unobserved descendants after three or four generations.
20
As depicted in Figure A.1, the stoppage age over this period marked the decline in fecundity and onset of sterility
associated with age-related infertility and onset of menopause, with a modal stoppage age of 41.

4.1

Semi-Parametric Analysis

The proposed hypothesis is confirmed initially using restricted cubic spline regression models. It
establishes that while a higher fecundity is associated with a larger number of children, an intermediate level of fecundity maximizes long-run reproductive success.21 The e↵ect of TFB of heads
of lineages on their number of descendants in the subsequent four generations, accounting for the
birth year and the marriage and stoppage age of heads of lineages, with confidence intervals based
on standard errors clustered for heads of lineages sharing the same firstborn is depicted in Figure
2.
The correlation in reproductive success between parents sharing the same firstborn, and therefore the same TFB, is accounted for by clustering the standard errors for heads of lineages sharing
the same firstborn.
In line with the proposed hypothesis, panel A shows an approximately linear negative partial
e↵ect of TFB on the number of children, confirming the conventional presumption that ceteris
paribus, a short time to first birth in the pre-demographic transition era increased the number
of children. In contrast, as hypothesized, an intermediate TFB maximizes long-run reproductive
success. In particular, panel B depicts a hump-shaped relation between TFB of heads of the
lineages and their number of grandchildren. The TFB of heads of lineages that maximizes the
number of grandchildren is associated with 48 grandchildren. Panels C and D reveal a similar
a hump-shaped relation between TFB of the heads of the lineages and their great-grandchildren
and great-great-grandchildren. The TFB of heads of lineages that maximizes the number of greatgrandchildren is associated with 194 great-grandchildren, whereas the optimal TFB of heads of
lineages for reproductive success in the 4rd generation (62 weeks) is associated with 306 greatgreat-grandchildren.
Figure 2 shows that, in accordance with the proposed hypothesis, TFB of heads of lineages has a
monotonically negative e↵ect on the number of children and a hump-shaped e↵ect on the number of
grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.22 Thus, heads of lineages with
an intermediate level of TFB achieved the maximal number of descendants in the long run, despite
having a smaller number of children relative to those with lower TFB.

4.2

Econometric Model

The negative relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and the number of children, as well as
the hump-shaped relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and long-run reproductive success,
is further assessed by estimating a series of regression models.
First, the e↵ect of TFB of the head of lineage on the number of children born to the head of
lineage is estimated using the OLS regression model:

Estimation based on Variation across all Heads of Lineages

The baseline OLS estimates of the e↵ect TFB of the head of lineage on reproductive success are
presented in Tables 1 and 2, accounting for the marriage age and the birth year of heads of lineages.
The initial estimates in Table 1 are based on variation in TFB across all head of lineages, whereas
those in Table 2 accounts for Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects, and thus presents estimates based
on variation in TFB within heads of lineages that are originated from the same mother. The
correlation in reproductive success between parents sharing the same firstborn, and therefore the
same TFB, is accounted for by clustering the standard errors for heads of lineages sharing the same
firstborn.
Consistently with the first element of proposed hypothesis, and the pattern depicted in Figure
2, panel A, column 1 of Table 1 establishes a highly significant negative association between TFB
of heads of lineages and the number of children. An increase in the TFB by one year results in a
reduction of 0.068 in the log number of children. In particular, an increase in TFB from 38 weeks
to 1 year and 38 weeks would result in a reduction of approximately 0.72 children.24
The positive association of an intermediate level of TFB and long-run reproductive success
is confirmed in columns 2–3, resembling the pattern depicted in Figure 2, panel C–D. Column 2
establishes a significant quadratic relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and the number of
23

To ensure that the logarithmic transformation is defined for extinct lineages, 1 is added to the number of
descendants in all generations. The results are robust to alternative methods that could account for extinct lineages.
In particular, Table 5 and Table A.5 demonstrates that the results are robust to the use of a GLM model with a
negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function.
24
Throughout the analysis, estimates on the original scale of numbers of descendants are corrected for retransformation bias in accordance with Duan (1983).

This table presents the results of a series of OLS regressions of the number of descendants in generation t on time to first birth, i.e. T F B and T F B 2 for heads of lineages
born prior to 1685. Birth year and marriage age dummies are included as controls. Furthermore, stoppage age dummies are included in columns 10–12. A dummy indicating
unknown literacy is included in the regressions underlying column 4–12. Standard errors clustered at the level of the firstborn are reported in parentheses. * p <0.10, **
p <0.05, *** p <0.01.

great-grandchildren.25 In particular, the first-order e↵ect of the quadratic expression is positive and
significant at the 5% level and the second-order e↵ect of the quadratic expression is negative and
significant at the 5% level. Similarly, column 3 establishes a highly significant quadratic relationship
between TFB of heads of lineages and the number of great-great-grandchildren. The first and
second-order e↵ects are both significant at the one percent level, and jointly highly significant
(p=0.007). Moreover, an additional test (not reported in the table) establishes a highly significant
hump-shaped relationship under this specification (p=0.009).26
Columns 4–6 establish that the results are robust to the inclusion of parental literacy as a
control variable. The highly significant negative association between TFB of heads of lineages and
the number of children is maintained and the coefficient is rather stable (column 4). Furthermore, a
significant quadratic relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and the number of descendants
in the second, third, and fourth generations is stable, although somewhat less significant (column
5–6). Moreover, a test of the joint significance of the two coefficient estimates related to the fourth
generation establishes that they are jointly highly significant (p = 0.009). Additionally, literacy is
positively associated with long-run reproductive success (columns 5–6). As will become apparent
in Table 6 and 7, literacy (and its potential association with a quality bias) is positively associated
with the fraction of surviving children that got married as well as their average marriage age, and
is thus rewarding in the long run.
Furthermore, columns 7–9 establish that the results are robust to the inclusion of a control
for gender. The highly significant negative association between TFB of heads of lineages and the
number of children is maintained and the coefficient is rather stable (column 7). Moreover, a
quadratic relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and the number of descendants is stable
and significant at the 5% level in the third and fourth generations (column 8–9). In addition, a test
of the joint significance of the two coefficient estimates related to the fourth generation establishes
that they are jointly highly significant (p = 0.006).
Finally, columns 10–12 establish that the results are robust to the inclusion of a control for the
stoppage age. The highly significant negative association between TFB of heads of lineages and
the number of children is maintained and the coefficient is rather stable (column 10). Furthermore,
the quadratic relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and the number of descendants in the
3rd and the 4th generations is rather stable and significant (column 11–12). In addition, a test of
the joint significance of the two coefficient estimates related to the fourth generation establishes
that they are jointly highly significant (p = 0.003).

4.4

Estimation based on Variation within Head of Lineages traced to the same
Maternal Founder

The e↵ect of fecundity on reproductive success may be a↵ected by variation in the genetic predisposition among genetically distinct heads of lineages, as well as their variation in cultural and
socio-economic background. Thus, the study attempts to further isolate the random variations in
TFB across head of lineages by accounting for common characteristics across heads of lineages originated from the same mother. In particular, similarities in the genetic, cultural, and socio-economic
characteristics across siblings, as opposed to across the population as a whole, are exploited to isolate the e↵ect of random variation in TFB on reproductive success. Accounting for these Maternal
Founder fixed e↵ects, as well as additional confounding factors and clustering of standard errors on
the level of the firstborn, the analysis explores the e↵ect of random variation in TFB on long-run
reproductive success.
As established in Table 2, the qualitative results established in Table 1 are una↵ected by the
inclusion of Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects. In particular, consistently with the first element of
proposed hypothesis, column 7 establishes a highly significant negative association between TFB of
heads of lineages and the number of children, accounting for the marriage age, birth year, literacy
status and gender of the heads of lineages. An increase in the TFB by one year results in a reduction
of 0.052 in the log number of children. Hence, an increase in TFB from 38 weeks to 1 year and 38
weeks would result in a reduction of approximately 0.76 children.
The beneficial e↵ects of an intermediate level of TFB on long-run reproductive success is confirmed in columns 8–9. They establish a significant hump-shaped e↵ect of TFB of heads of lineages
on the number of descendants in the third and fourth generations, accounting for the marriage age,
birth year, literacy status and gender of the heads of lineages. In particular, the first and second order terms are highly significant for great-great-grandchildren. In addition, the first-order coefficient
and second-order coefficient estimates are jointly highly significant. Furthermore, as established in
columns 10–12 the findings are robust to the inclusion of control for the stoppage age. In particular, the first and second order terms are highly significant for great-great-grandchildren and the
additional test for a hump-shaped relationship for great-great-grandchildren is highly significant
(p = 0.007).
The analysis suggests that the maximal reproductive success is attained by heads of lineages
with a moderate TFB (i.e., those whose first delivery occurs 65 weeks after their marriage, in
comparison to a sample median of 53 weeks), suggesting that the forces of natural selection may
have had a positive e↵ect on the median TFB in the population over this time period. In particular,
in comparison to highly fertile couples whose first child is born 38 weeks after the marriage, those
individuals have on average 0.3 fewer children, but 0.6 more grandchildren, 9.5 additional greatgrandchildren, and 15 added great-great-grandchildren.
25

The analysis focus on the e↵ect on long-run reproductive success and hence on the 3rd and the 4th generations.
As is apparent from Figure 2, the e↵ect on the 2nd generation is similar qualitatively but somewhat less significant.
26
See Lind and Mehlum (2010).

15

Thus, the regression analysis presented in Table 2 confirms the hypothesis that higher fecundity
in the pre-demographic transition era was associated with a larger number of children, while an
intermediate level of fecundity maximized long-run reproductive success.

5

Robustness

This section establishes the robustness of the qualitative results to (i) alternative sample periods,
(ii) a wide range of potential confounding factors, accounting for geographic location at birth and
death, birth order, month of birth, month of birth of the firstborn, number of marriages, and
immigration and emigration status of the spouse, for each head of lineage, and (iii) alternative
estimation method (GLM).

5.1

Alternative Sample Periods

While the analysis accounts for cohort e↵ects by the inclusion of birth year dummies, the economic
and ecological environment may have changed over the sample period, shifting the costs and benefits
of investment in o↵spring and thus a↵ecting the existence or the nature of a long-run reproductive
trade-o↵. Therefore, it might be a concern whether the baseline regression analysis is representative
of alternative sample periods. Reassuringly, the main results are qualitatively unchanged if the
analysis focuses on the reproductive success of heads of lineages born over a significantly shorter
period, for example the period 1660–1685 (Table 3), as well as over a longer period, for example
the entire sample period (Table 4).

5.2
5.2.1

Additional Attributes of Heads of Lineages
Spousal migration

Immigrants may di↵er systematically from natives reflecting the circumstances that led to their
decision to immigrate as well as the e↵ects of immigration on their socio-economic status and
thus their TFB and reproductive success. Thus, the migration status of the first spouse may have
a↵ected the TFB and the reproductive success of heads of lineages. In the sample, heads of lineages
were neither immigrants nor emigrants. Nevertheless, 23.5% of their first spouses were immigrants
and 0.5% were emigrants. To account for the potential e↵ect of spousal migration, dummy variables
indicating the immigration and emigration status of heads of lineages are included in the regression
analysis performed in Table 2. As established in Table A.2, the qualitative results are una↵ected
by the migration status of the first spouse of the head of lineage.
5.2.2

Remarriages

Some head of lineages and their spouses, remarried, possibly multiple times, reflecting in part a
considerable mortality rate over this period. The formation of additional unions may a↵ect the
reproductive success of heads of lineages via various channels, reflecting possibly the health and

This table presents the results of a series of GLM regressions, with a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function, of the number of descendants in generation
t on time to first birth, i.e. T F B and T F B 2 . All regressions include dummies for Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects (the results without the Maternal Founder Fixed E↵ects
is presented in Table A.6). Birth year and marriage age dummies are included as controls. Furthermore, stoppage age dummies are included in columns 10–12. A dummy
indicating unknown literacy is included in the regressions underlying column 4–12. Standard errors clustered at the level of the firstborn are reported in parentheses. * p <0.10,
** p <0.05, *** p <0.01.

socioeconomic circumstances that led to these remarriages, as well as the potential di↵erential
treatment of previous and new children in the newly formed household. To account for the e↵ect
of remarriages, dummy variables indicating the number of marriages experienced by each head of
lineage are included in the regressions performed in Table 2. As established in Table A.2, the
qualitative results are una↵ected by accounting for remarriages.27
5.2.3

Gender

Reflecting an earlier marriage age of women relative to men, the sample of heads of lineages is
unbalanced across gender. Although men on average married at a later age than women (i.e., 26.6
for men versus 19.4 for women), their average age at last delivery was higher (i.e., 46.3 for men
versus 38.3 for women), and they remarried more often, resulting in a higher number of children
per male (i.e., 10 for men versus 9.4 for woman). The e↵ect of gender is directly accounted for as
a control in the regressions performed in Tables 1 and 2. As an additional robustness check, Table
A.3 demonstrate that the results are qualitatively similar in a sample that includes only females.
5.2.4

Birth and Death Parishes

The parishes of birth and death may a↵ect TFB of heads of lineages and their reproductive success
due to the influence of cultural and socioeconomic factors in a parish on the resources and preferences of heads of lineages. To account for the e↵ect of these confounding geographical factors,
dummy variables indicating the parishes of birth and death of each head of lineages are included
in the regressions performed in Tables 2. As established in Table A.4, the qualitative results are
una↵ected by accounting for these parish fixed e↵ects.
5.2.5

Month of Marriage and Month of Birth of Firstborn

The month of marriage may a↵ect TFB and reproductive success of heads of lineages due to influence
of climatic conditions on resources, nutrition and human physiology. In addition, the month of birth
of the firstborn may a↵ect the resources of heads of lineages and thus their reproductive success. To
account for these confounding seasonal factors, dummy variables indicating the month of marriage
for each head of lineage and the months of birth of the first born of each head of lineage are included
in the regression performed in Tables 1 and 2. As established in Table A.4, the qualitative results
are una↵ected by accounting for these seasonal factors.
5.2.6

Birth Order

The birth order of heads of lineages may a↵ect their TFB and reproductive success due to its e↵ect
of their nourishment as children, physiology, intergenerational transfers of wealth, and therefore
27

Excluding remarriages of head of lineages would reduce the sample size considerably and thus would a↵ect the
significance of the estimations. Nevertheless, the qualitative results would not be altered and the existence of the

resources as adults. To account for the potential e↵ect of birth order, a dummy variable indicating
if the head of lineage is the first birth among individuals sharing the same mother is included
in the regressions performed in Tables 2. As established in Table A.5, the qualitative results are
una↵ected by accounting for the firstborn status of heads of lineages. Moreover, the firstborn status
has no significant e↵ect on reproductive success. Furthermore, accounting for the entire birth order
of each head of lineage does not alter the qualitative results.

5.3

Alternative Estimation Method

The negative relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and the number of children, as well as
the hump-shaped relationship between TFB of heads of lineages and long-run reproductive success,
is established using quadratic OLS regression models. Table 5 and A.6 demonstrate that these
negative relationships are robust to an alternative estimation method, using a generalized linear
model (GLM) with a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function.

Mechanism

The section identifies several mechanisms that had contributed to the trade-o↵ associated with
higher fecundity. In particular, it establishes the observed hump-shaped e↵ect of TFB on reproductive success in the long run reflects the positive e↵ect of reduced fertility and thus higher child
quality on the reproductive success of each child. While higher TFB reduced the number of children, it contributed to the quality of each child, as reflected by health, survivability, education, and
earning capacity, and had therefore a↵ected the long-run reproductive success of the lineage.28
The findings suggest that child quality enhanced the likelihood that: (i) a child would reach the
reproductive age and would have the qualities that would permit a success in the marriage market
– preconditions for reproductive success, (ii) a child would have the qualities and the necessary
income to be able to marry and start the process of reproduction earlier in life, and (iii) a child
would become educated and thus would have higher earning capacity and reproductive success.
In particular, the fraction of children that survived till the end of their reproductive age, and
succeeded to get married determined the fraction of o↵spring that contributed to the number of
descendants and thus long-run reproductive success. Moreover, among children that got married,
the average marriage age determined their average age of onset of reproductive activity and therefore
the long-run reproductive success of the heads of lineages.
These marriage channels are explored in Table 6 and 7. The e↵ect of TFB on the likelihood
that a child married is explored in Table 6.29 As established in column 1, the negative association
28

The interaction between demography and human capital formation is at the center of Unified Growth Theory
(Cervellati and Sunde, 2005; Boucekkine et al., 2007; Galor, 2011).
29
Due to the fact that the outcome variable is a fraction, the estimates presented in this table are based on the
fractional logit model (Papke and Wooldridge, 1996). The results are robust to the inclusion of marriage age, birth
year and stoppage age as continuous variables. In particular, the coefficient on TFB in the first, second, third and
fourth column would all increase in size to 0.316 (p = 0.005), 0.268 (p = 0.015), 0.255 (p = 0.020), and 0.256
(p = 0.020), respectively. Furthermore, the results are robust to the use of a linear probability model. In particular,

This table presents the results of a series of fractional logit regressions of the
fraction of children surviving to age 40 that got married on time to first birth,
i.e. T F B and T F B 2 for heads of lineages with at least one child surviving
to age 40. Birth year and marriage age dummies are included as controls.
Furthermore, stoppage age dummies are included in column 4. A dummy
indicating unknown literacy is included in the regressions underlying column
2–4. Standard errors clustered at the level of the firstborn are reported in
parentheses. * p <0.10, ** p <0.05, *** p <0.01.

between the fraction of children surviving to age 40 that got married and the TFB of heads of
lineages is highly statistically significant.30 In particular, accounting for the marriage age and
birth year of heads of lineages, as well as gradually for their literacy status as well as gender,
there is a significant negative e↵ect of TFB on the fraction of children surviving to age 40 that
got married. Thus, it appears that the marriage success channel plays a role in accounting for the
established hump-shaped pattern between TFB and long-run reproductive success.31
The e↵ect of TFB on the average marriage age of married o↵spring is explored in Table 7. As
established in column 1, the association between the average marriage age among o↵spring that got
married and TFB of heads of lineages is negative and highly significant statistically. In particular,
the coefficient on TFB in the first, second, third and fourth column would be 0.018 (p < 0.005), 0.015 (p < 0.016),
0.014 (p = 0.029), and 0.013 (p = 0.035), respectively. Since the Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects constitute an
unbalanced panel, the fractional logit model does not account for these fixed e↵ects (Papke and Wooldridge, 2008).
However, accounting for these fixed e↵ects in a fixed-e↵ects linear probability model yields similar results, although
less precisely estimated. In particular, the estimate in column 4 would be 0.10 (p = 0.127). Under an alternative age
criteria of 30 years instead of 40 years the estimate the estimate would be 0.011 (p = 0.087)).
30
This finding is robust to the use of alternative age cut-o↵s. In particular, the e↵ect of TFB on the fraction of
surviving children that got married is statistically significant at the 5% level in all specifications when using 30, 35
or 45 as the surviving cut-o↵ age.
31
Underlying, in part, this positive e↵ect of TFB on the marriage probability of o↵spring surviving to age 40
may be a positive association between TFB and the average longevity of o↵spring. Indeed, OLS regressions on
the basis of the entire sample period, i.e., the regression sample underlying Table 4, suggests there is a positive
association between TFB and the average longevity of o↵spring. In particular, measuring average longevity in years,
the coefficient on TFB in the first, second, third and fourth column would be 1.063 (p = 0.038), 0.963 (p = 0.060),
0.980 (p = 0.056), and 1.033 (p = 0.043), respectively. It should be noted that this results depend on the abscence of
control for Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects and the larger sample period.

This table presents the results of a series of fractional logit regressions of the share

of lineages with at least one surviving child with observed literacy status. Birth
year and marriage age dummies are included as controls. Furthermore, stoppage age

accounting for the marriage age and birth year of heads of lineages, as well as gradually for their
literacy status and gender, there is a significant negative relationship between TFB and the average
marriage age of children that got married.32 Thus, it appears that the marriage success channel
plays a role in accounting for the established hump-shaped pattern between TFB and long-run
reproductive success.
The education channel is investigated in Table 8. As established in column 1, TFB of heads of
lineages has a highly significant positive association with the fraction of literate children, accounting
for the marriage age and birth year of heads of lineages. As controls are gradually introduced
to account for the confounding e↵ects of the literacy status, gender, and stoppage age of heads
of lineages, the positive coefficient remains stable and significant at the 1% significance level.33
Moreover, literacy of heads of lineages has a highly significant positive e↵ect on the literacy of their
children.

Concluding Remarks

This research explores the biocultural origins of human capital formation. It presents the first
evidence that moderate fecundity and thus predisposition towards investment in child quality was
conducive for long-run reproductive success within the human species. Using an extensive genealogical record for nearly half a million individuals in Quebec from the sixteenth to the eighteenth
centuries, the study explores the e↵ect of fecundity on the number of descendants of early inhabitants in the subsequent four generations. The research exploits variation in the random component
of the time interval between the date of first marriage and the first birth to establish that while
higher fecundity is associated with a larger number of children, an intermediate level maximizes
long-run reproductive success. Moreover, the observed hump-shaped e↵ect of fecundity on long-run
reproductive success reflects the negative e↵ect of higher fecundity on the quality of each child.
The research further indicates that the optimal level of fecundity was below the population
median, suggesting that the forces of natural selection favored individuals with a lower level of
32

In fixed-e↵ects regressions accounting for Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects, the coefficient estimate drops somewhat resulting in decreased statistical significance. However, the finding remains statistically significant at the 10%
significance level in the entire sample period, i.e., the regression sample underlying Table 4. In particular, in the
regression corresponding to that underlying column 4, controlling for Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects in the entire
sample period, the e↵ect of TFB on the average marriage age of o↵spring is 0.181 (p = 0.082).
33
As in Table 6, the regressions underlying Table 8 are based on fractional logit models. The results are robust to
the inclusion of marriage age, birth year and stoppage age as continuous variables. In particular, the coefficient on
TFB in the first, second, third and fourth column would be 0.392 (p < 0.001), 0.334 (p < 0.001), 0.314 (p < 0.001),
and 0.311 (p < 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the results are robust to the use of a linear probability model. In
particular, the coefficient on TFB in the first, second, third and fourth column would be 0.071 (p < 0.001), 0.060
(p < 0.001), 0.054 (p < 0.001), and 0.055 (p < 0.001), respectively. Since the Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects constitute
an unbalanced panel, the fractional logit model does not account for these fixed e↵ects (Papke and Wooldridge, 2008).
Accounting for the fixed e↵ects in a fixed-e↵ects linear probability model on the baseline sample also yields positive
estimates of the coefficient on TFB, although the estimates are insignificant. However, focusing on heads of lineages
born prior to and including 1660, the positive e↵ect of TFB on the average literacy of o↵spring is statistically
significant. In particular, the estimate in column 4 would be 0.137 (p = 0.002). Thus, the statistical evidence of
the positive e↵ect of lower TFB based on variation within siblings sharing the same Maternal Founder on o↵spring
literacy is strongest for the first part of the baseline period.

fecundity and thus higher predisposition towards investment in child quality. The research lends
credence to the hypothesis that during the Malthusian epoch, natural selection favored individuals
with a larger predisposition towards child quality, contributing to human capital formation, the
onset of the demographic transition and the evolution of societies from an epoch of stagnation to
sustained economic growth.

The moderate increase in the mean and median number of descendants from the third to the fourth

this e↵ect is more pronounced among men.

This table presents the results of a series of fixed-e↵ects regressions of the number of descendants in generation t on time to first
birth, i.e. T F B and T F B 2 . All regressions account for Maternal Founder fixed e↵ects. Birth year, marriage age and stoppage
age dummies are included as controls. A dummy indicating unknown literacy is also included in the regressions. In columns 1–3,
dummies for the total number of marriages experienced during the lifetime of the heads of lineages, as well as dummies for the total
number of marriages experienced by the first spouses of the heads of lineages, are included. In columns 4–6, dummies indicating the
immigration and emigration statuses of the head of the first spouses of the heads of lineages are included. Standard errors clustered
