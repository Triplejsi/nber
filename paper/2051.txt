The Competitiveness and Comparative Advantage of U.S. Multinationals,
1957—1983

ABSTRACT

The share in world exports of manufactured goods of U.S. multinational
firms, including their majority—owned overseas affiliates, has been nearly
stable since 1966. This stability, over a period in which the export share
of the U.S. as a geographical entity was declining for the most part,
suggests that it was not declines in the competitiveness of American
firms' management and technology that were responsible for the deterioration of the U.S. trade position. That view is reinforced by the fact that
a good deal of the change in U.S. export shares can be explained by changes
in U.S. prices relative to those of other countries.
The comparative advantage of both the U.S. and U.S. multinational
firms, especially the latter, has been in chemicals, machinery, and
transport equipment, industries with relatively fast growth in worldwide
exports. The growth of U.S. exports in 1966—77 fell far short of what
it would have been if the U.S. had retained its share in each industry.
The growth of U.S. multinationals' exports fell a little short of that
implied by constant—shares but surpassed that of the U.S. as a country in
almost every industry. After 1977, both the U.S. and its multinationals
kept up with their constant share growth rates and the U.S. even ran a bit
ahead. The multinationals' position as exporters, now supplying almost
half their exports from their majority—owned overseas affiliates, seems to
have been quite insulated from changes in U.S. policies and circumstances.

THE COMPETITIVENESS AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE OF U.S. MULTINATIONALS
1957—1983*

Robert E. Lipsey and Irving B. Kravis

Introduction

In an earlier study it was shown that the share in world manufactured
exports of firms located in the U.S. moved differently from the share of U.S.
multinational firms, including both their domestic and their overseas opera-

tions. The U.S. share fell steadily from the 1950's through the mid-1970's,
but the share of U.S. multinational firms did not decline at all or even
increased (Lipsey and Kravis, 1985). That contrast suggests that it is important to distinguish between the factors that determine the competitiveness of
the U.S. as a production location and those that determine the competitiveness
of U.S. firms. The latter might include characteristics such as the firms'
management and technology, since the firm characteristics would affect the
firms' performance in both home and foreign operations.

Much of the standard analysis of trade developments explains increases or
decreases in a country's exports and imports or shares in world trade by

*We are indebted for valuable comments and suggestions to the participants in a meeting at the National Science Foundation. Linda Molinari
was responsible for much of the programming and statistical work and Rosa
Schupbach and James Hayes for the preparation of the manuscript.
This research, part of the National Bureau's program in International
Studies, was done mainly as a part of a study of the competitiveness of
U.S. firms supported by a grant to the National Bureau from the National
Science Foundation (PRA-8513944) and a grant to the University of
Pennsylvania by the Ford Foundation (No. 855-0678). Some support was also
received through the NBER's program on U.S. Trade Policy, Competitiveness,
and Capital Mobility in the World Economy (NSF Grant No. PRA-8116459). Any

changes in the country's prices relative to those of its competitors and
suppliers and by changes in incomes in its markets. That emphasis on price
developments is the reason for the belief that the very high exchange value of
the U.S. dollar was a major factor accounting for the large U.S. trade and
current account deficits of recent years.

A rival explanation for U.S. trade difficulties that has been offered in
recent years is that the problems are internal to U.S. firms; they have lost
their technological lead or their management skills and, therefore, alterations in monetary and fiscal policies will not restore the competitiveness of
the U.S. (See, for example, Abernathy et al., 1983). The decline of U.S. firms
is seen as stemming from defects in the training of managers, from the emphasis in U.S. firms on short—term results, from the deterioration of technical
education in this country, or from the declining U.S. lead in research and
development investment.

Factors internal to firms are just the ones that have, in the last few
years, become the main explanations for the phenomenon of direct investment.
They are the elements of the competitiveness and comparative advantage of
individual firms that enable them to produce in countries outside the ones
where they originated in competition with local firms that have the advantage
of familiarity with local product and factor markets and the favor of local
governments. In the literature on multinationals (e.g., Dunning, 1981), these
are treated as belonging to firms rather than to countries, and as being
readily transferable from country to country within, but not between, firms.
The more transferable these attributes are geographically, the less they can
be the basis for national competitiveness and comparative advantage.
The implication for national trade policy is that factors that contribute

—3—

to firm competitiveness and comparative advantage will not necessarily contribute to national competitiveness and comparative advantage. Subsidies to
R & D, to innovation, or to management or technical training may enhance the
competitiveness of national firms in world markets, but that competitiveness
may be exploited by producing outside the home country.
A corresponding implication is that the factors producing firm comparative advantages should be studied by examining measures of the competitiveness and comparative advantage of firms rather than that of their home
countries. And any large difference between the fortunes of a country and
those of the firms based in it helps us to determine whether the responsibility for changes lies with macroeconomic policy or with the determinants
of firm advantages, such as management or technology.

The Export Share of the U.S.
Although our main interest in this paper is in the competitiveness of
U.S. multinationals, we begin by examining, for comparison, developments in
the competitiveness of the U.S. as a country. U.S. export shares of manufactured goods declined from the early or mid-1950's to the early or late 1970's,
the date depending on the series used for measurement. The years 1976—78 were
the lowest points so far in most series, and there was some recovery after
that. Ratios for the years covered by surveys of U.S. investment abroad were
as follows:

The period from 1977 to 1982 saw a slight reversal of that trend, although it
may turn out to be only a temporary one.

The Role of Prices
Of the two broad explanations for changing export shares suggested above,

we explore only very briefly here the role of prices. A measure of the change
in U.S. prices relative to those of its main competitors, or what we might
call the price competitiveness of the U.S. is shown in Appendix Table U-16.
It is an index of U.S. export prices relative to an index of world prices of
manufactured exports, based on prices of the U.S. and of six main competitors,

weighted by the importance of commodities in U.S. exports as described in

—5—

Bushe, Kravis, and Lipsey (1986).

We ask first whether movements in the relative U.S. price level explain
annual U.S. shares in exports of manufactures in the period from 1955 through
1983.

The export share of the U.S. as a country is explained by a downward trend and
by the current and lagged price levels. The equation implies that a higher
relative U.S. price level is associated with a higher U.S. export share the
year it occurs but a lower share the year after. By the end of the year after
the U.S. price increase, the U.S. export share would be below the one preceding the price rise.
in this equation is accounted for by the

trend term. An alternative approach is to explain changes in the U.S. export
share by changes in relative prices.

The equation, explaining a little more than a third of the variation in
shares, again indicates that a rise in the relative U.S. export price first

-6increases the U.S. export share in the year of the price increase and then
reduces it the next year. The total decrease in share resulting from the price
increase is about 11 per cent of the price change, implying a cumulative
elasticity of substitution a little over one.

We can also test whether a high price level has any independent influence
on changes in the U.S. export share aside from that of the price change

aAfter correction for serial correlation
The price level coefficient is negative even when the current and lagged price
changes are included in the equation, suggesting some additional unfavorable
effects of high prices. However, the price level adds little to the explanation of trade shares once lagged price changes are included.
These results indicate that a good deal of the competitiveness of the
U.S. as a country can be attributed to U.S. price levels and changes in them,
relative to the rest of the world. Earlier work on machinery and transport
equipment (Kravis and Lipsey, 1981, and Bushe, Kravis, and Lipsey, 1986) has
suggested that a more thorough analysis would reveal still longer lags and
price elasticities or substitution elasticities further above unity.
These export responses to price levels and price changes include the

behavior of U.S. parent companies and must reflect their actions to a considerable extent, since they account for about two thirds of U.S. exports of
manufactured goods. We now turn to the analysis of their exporting patterns.

The Competitiveness of U.S. Multinationals
We saw earlier that the U.S. share in world manufactured exports declined
between 1957 and 1966 from 21 or 22 per cent to 16-18 per cent. It then
dropped to the 13 to 14 per cent range in 1977, where it remained in the early
1980's. The figures are repeated in line 1 to make comparisons with the export
record of multinationals easy.

It can be seen (line 4) that the overall share of U.S.-based multinationals, including exports by parents and majority-owned affiliates (MOFA5),1

was essentially stable. Exports from the U.S. by multinational parents
shared, though to an attenuated degree, the decline between 1966 and 1977 in

total U.S. exports. However, the growth of affiliate exports more than offset
this decline.

As is implied by the fact that parent export shares declined less than
those of the U.S. as a whole, the share of parent firms in U.S. exports of

manufactures rose substantially between 1966 and 1977. Some of that rise was
lost between 1977 and 1982.

multinational to multinational status. In fact, the number of firms reporting
as multinationals actually decreased slightly from 1966 to 1977, as can be

seen in Appendix Table U-b. However, in the period when the multinationals'
share decreased, between 1977 and 1982, there was a substantial decline in the
population of U.S. multinational firms.2
The shares of majority-owned affiliates in exports of both developed and
LOC host countries shows a pattern of sharp increases and, f or developed

countries, rough stability since 1977. The MOFA share in exports of developed
countries increased by more than 50 per cent in the 20 years before 1977 and
then remained fairly stable through 1983. And the share of U.S. affiliates in
LDC exports grew by almost 75 per cent from 1957 through 1977 at a time when
the share of these countries in world exports was also increasing

substantially,3 and continued to rise at least through 1982. Thus, in both
developed and less developed host countries, there was a period of active
development in which the majority-owned affiliates outpaced other host-country

2Part of this reduction in population may be illusory and the growth of
parent exports therefore understated. The cutoff point below which full data
for affiliates did not have to be reported was increased from $500,000 in 1977
to $3 million in 1982. Any parent firm with no affiliates above the cutoff
size was exempt from reporting on its own activities. We were able to make an
adjustment, quite small, for the effect of this change on affiliate exports,
but we are not able to guess the effect on parent exports or other parent
variables. The impact on aggregate affiliate measures is limited by the unimportance of affiliates of that size in the totals, but it is conceivable that
quite large parents with only marginal overseas production were eliminated
from the list even without making any changes in their overseas activities.
Thus, we do not know what the decline in parents' share of U.S. exports represents. It could be mostly a statistical artifact, it could represent a
turning away from multinationality by U.S. firms, or it could represent a
decline in the competitiveness of U.S. multinationals relative to other U.S.
firms, or a shift in U.S. comparative advantage away from industries in which
U.S. multinationals have their advantages. A conclusion on this issue requires
disaggregation by industry and the study of fixed groups of firms.
3This result seems to contradict the findings of a paper by Nayyar (1978)
to the effect that the share of U.S. majority-owned affiliates in developingcountry exports fell from about 10.6 per cent to below 9 per cent in the early
1970's. The growth of affiliate exports to 1974 in Nayyar's data seems very

-10-

firms, followed by a period of less dynamic growth (for both the countries and
the affiliates), in which the affiliates' exports increased in step with those
of other host—country firms.

As is implied by what has been said about parents and affiliates,
majority-owned overseas affiliates' shares in exports by U.S. multinationals
jumped substantially from 1966 to 1977, and their share of exports by all U.S.
firms more than doubled from 1957 to 1977. Then the affiliates' share
decreased slightly between 1977 and 1982 before increasing again, to its
highest recorded level, in 1983.

That switch in the 1977-82 period suggests a move by U.S. multinational firms

toward producing in the U.S., perhaps as a response to the low values of the
U.S. dollar in the late 1970's and early 1980's, before shifting back toward
foreign production as the dollar recovered.

To what may the superior foreign export performance of U.S.-controlled
firms be attributed? Several possibilities suggest themselves. One is that

slow in view of our 1977 census total. Furthermore, he defined aggregate developing country manufactured exports much more narrowly than in our calculations.

—11—

American affiliates were sharing in the superior (to the U.S.) export growth
of their host countries. This would involve behavior like that of other
domestic firms in the host countries. Another is that U.S. parents systemati—
cally shifted export operations to foreign bases through diminution or slower
growth in U.S. exports. Perhaps in the end the basic factors underlying export
sourcing decisions are riot very different for these two possible explanations.

However, if U.S. affiliate exports merely kept pace with the rate of growth in
host country exports, there may be a stronger presumption that the ME was

simply responding to the host country's competitive opportunities. Affiliate
export performance in host countries superior to that of both local firms and
U.S. parents, on the other hand, suggests an active policy of shifting exports
and a role in promoting host-country export growth.

The Comparative Advantage of U.S. Multinationals
Before examining how different industries contributed to these changes in
exports and export shares we use the distribution of exports among industries
to identify the comparative advantage of the United States and of its multina-

tional firms. We identify the comparative advantage in terms of the relative
distributions of exports. U.S. multinationals, for example, are regarded as
having a comparative advantage in the chemical industry relative to the U.S.
as a country (or to the world as a whole), if the share of chemicals in their

exports is larger than the share of chemicals in U.S. (or world) exports. It
would be desirable to use net exports as the criterion for countries, but we
have not so far made such calculations for the multinationals, and it is also
not as clear for them what the figures would mean. One reason for the uncertainty is that their exports are classified by industry rather than by pro-

—12—

duct, and while we consider it reasonable to assume that their exports are
within that industry, the assumption that their imports were also in the same
industry would be more questionable. Another drawback to this method of
assessing comparative advantage is that it ignores distortions in the composition of trade due to government interventions.

The differences between the distributions of U.S. and U.S. multinationals'
exports and those of the world and of developed countries in 1966, the first
year for which all are available, are given below. They show that the U.S. had
comparative advantages relative to the world in chemicals, machinery, par-

ticularly non-electrical, and transport equipment. U.S. multinational firms'
comparative advantage ran along the same lines, but to an exaggerated degree.
Their concentration in chemicals and machinery was slightly greater than that
of the U.S. and in transport equipment, much greater, while they exported a
smaller proportion of foods, metals, and other manufactured products.

The corresponding comparisons for 1982 show a similar pattern for the U.S.

However, there were some shifts. The U.S. had less of a comparative advantage
in chemicals and transport equipment and more in non-electrical machinery, and

larger disadvantages in metals. The breakdown of transport equipment into
motor vehicles and equipment and other transport equipment reveals that the
U.S. comparative advantage was in the latter subgroup, mainly aircraft and

parts. In motor vehicles the U.S. showed comparative disadvantages relative
to the world and to developed countries as a group.

For U.S. multinational firms, a finer breakdown by industry for 1982 than was
available for 1966 reveals that they possessed comparative advantages relative
to the world as a whole and to developed countries in both electrical and nonelectrical machinery. Largely, the industry pattern of their comparative

-14-

advantage was similar in 1982 to the earlier one, with some shift towards chemicals and a large decline in their comparative advantage in transport equip-

ment. The breakdown of the transport equipment industry into the two
subgroups indicates that U.S. multinationals held comparative advantages in
both, and that the margins were larger for motor vehicles than for other
transport equipment.

The 1982 comparison between U.S. multinationals and the U.S. as a country
(Col. 5) shows that the multinationals' comparative advantage in machinery
relative to that of other U.S. firms had disappeared; the U.S. as a production
location showed a large comparative advantage relative to U.S multinationals,
although the latter enjoyed a smaller, but noticeable, comparative advantage
in electrical machinery relative to the U.S. The multinationals, by 1982, had
increased their advantage in chemicals but reduced that in transport equipment

relative to the U.S. Within transport equipment, U.S. multinationals had a
large comparative advantage in motor vehicles relative to the U.S. but the

US. as a country had a noticeable comparative advantage in other transport
equipment relative to U.S. multinationals. The contrast reflects the fact
that the motor vehicle industry is one of the most multinational of U.S.
industries in its operations, -in the sense that a high proportion of its

employment is overseas (Kuichycky and Lipsey, 1984, p. 2) and it does much of
its exporting from abroad, while the other transport equipment industry is
among the least multinational and does most of its exporting from the U.S.
Even among parent firms, other transport equipment companies have small proportions of their employment abroad relative to parents in other industries,
and tend to fill export demand from the U.S.

The differences between the comparative advantages of the U.S. and of U.S.

-15-

multinationals would show up more strongly if we compared the multinationals, or
the parent companies themselves, with non-multinational U.S. companies. However,
that comparison is difficult because of incompatabilities in the classification
of exports between the product classification for the U.S. and the industry
classification we used for the multinationals. That problem is obvious in
industries such as chemicals and- electrical machinery that are almost completely

dominated by multinationals, as can be seen in Appendix Table U-3. where estimated electrical machinery industry exports from the U.S. by U.S. multinational parents and foreign-owned firms in the U.S. are larger than total U.S.
exports of electrical machinery.4 It is clear, in any case, that U.S. parents
possess large comparative advantages relative to non-multinational U.S. firms
in chemicals and electrical machinery, but that the non-multinational firms
have a strong comparative advantage in non-electrical machinery.
A different set of observations on the comparative advantage of the U.S.
and of U.S. multinationals can be made by comparing U.S. firms in general and

U.S. parents with foreign—owned firms in the U.S. In this case we are comparing U.S. firms not with foreign countries in general but with foreign
multinationals, holding constant the production conditions of the U.S.

4me problem is not only one of product and industry classification but
also reflects the fact that there is some duplication between the firms listed
as U.S. multinationals and those listed as foreign-controlled U.S. firms.

Data on exports by foreign—owned firms in the U.S. are not available for

1966 but we can make the comparisons for 1977 and 1982. The earlier year may
be affected by the fact that many of the foreign-owned operations were new or
had been foreign-owned for only a short time.
The most striking characteristic of the exports by foreign-owned U.S.
firms in 1977 was the high concentration in chemicals, mainly by German multinationals, and the absence of exports of transport equipment, both areas of

U.S. and U.S. firms' comparative advantage. The concentration of exports by
the foreign multinationals -in chemicals increased substantially between 1977

and 1982. Thus, although chemicals was an industry of U.S. and U.S.
multinationals' comparative advantage relative to the rest of the world, there
are indications that at least German multinational firms possessed greater
firm-specific advantages -in this area. The comparative disadvantage of
foreign multinationals in transport equipment was still large in 1982 but had
diminished greatly, especially relative to the U.S. in general.

Competitiveness Within Industry Groups
The decline in the competitiveness of the U.S. relative to other developed
countries and to the world between 1966 and 1982, as manifested in its falling
shares of exports, was spread across all the major industry groups.

However, it was smaller in non-electrical machinery than in the other groups.
Relative to developed countries, the decline was smaller in the whole machinery industry than in any of the others except miscellaneous manufactures.
As we know from the aggregate data presented earlier, the story was quite
different for the worldwide operations of U.S. multinationals, including those
of parents and their majority-owned affiliates.

U.S. multinationals gained in world export shares in food and chemicals and
lost shares in the other industries. Even where their world shares declined,
they held up better than those of the U.S. as a country. That relationship
can be seen clearly in the ratio of the export share changes for U.S. multinationals to those for the U.S. as a country.

On the average, U.S. multinationals' export shares increased more or decreased
less than those of the U.S. by a margin of about 20 per cent. In no industry
group did they lose relative to the U.S. as a whole, but in machinery the
growth of their exports from developed countries just kept pace with that of
the U.S.

In the case of machinery, both U.S. multinationals and the U.S. as a
country lost ground, but neither by much. In the case of transport equipment,
both the U.S. as a country and U.S. multinationals lost export shares by
around a quarter of the 1966 level.

Comparative Advantage, Growth in Demand, and Overall Competitiveness
Changes in the overall competitiveness of a country or of its multinational firms can be factored into several elements. One is the set of changes in
competitiveness within industries. A second is their comparative advantage,
which determines the extent to which they produce and export in each industry.
And a third is the rate at which world trade grows in each industry. The last is
partly a reflection of the rate of growth of demand and partly a result of

—20-

shifts in the degree to which demand is met by each country's local output in
each industry. The first two of these elements have already been touched upon.
The third element has varied a good deal among industries. In the whole
period covered, and in each of the sub-periods, world exports of chemicals,
electrical machinery, and transport equipment grew more rapidly than manufactured exports in general, while exports of foods and metals grew less and those
of non-electrical machinery and other manufacturing clustered close to the
average.

Both the U.S. and U.S.—owned multinational firms were oriented toward the
faster-growing industries in this breakdown, with their below-average
weighting of foods and metals and high weights for chemicals, machinery, and
transport equipment. This was even more the case for the U.S. multinationals
than for the U.S. Thus, if the U.S. and its multinational firms had retained

—21—

their shares of exports within these industry groups, their shares of aggregate
manufacturing exports would have increased.

We can compare the actual changes in U.S. and U.S. multinational firms
exports with those that would have occurred if they had retained their 1966
shares within industries. We refer below to this calculated export growth as
"constant share" export growth.

The bias of the U.S. and U.S. multinationals toward fast-growing industry
groups is indicated by their high "constant share" growth rates, a little
higher for the multinationals than for the U.S. but both above the world

growth rate. Actual U.S. exports fell far short of that hypothetical growth
and the export growth of multinationals fell short as well, although not by as
much. That means that the stability in the U.S. multinationals' share of world
exports was the result of a combination of declining shares within at least
some industry groups with an orientation toward the faster-growing industries.

In the decade from 1966 to 1977, the comparative advantage of both the U.S.

and U.S. firms favored above-average export growth, given the rates of growth
of the seven industry groups. The prospective margin in the constant-share
growth ratio for the U.S. was .16 over the world growth ratio and for U.S.

multinationals the margin was .38. In actuality the U.S. fell far below the
hypothetical constant share growth rate and far below the world growth rate

despite its favorable composition of exports. U.S. multinationals' exports
grew at close to the world rate because their export composition was
favorable, and the favorable export mix made up for the loss of shares within
groups.

Given the industry growth rates over the next five years, the U.S. and
U.S. multinational firm export mixes in 1977 would have produced roughly

constant shares in total manufactured exports. In fact, U.S. exports grew at
a little more than both the world rate and their constant share rate. For U.S.
multinationals, actual export growth was close to the world rate, as in the

earlier period. However, their growth was below the U.S. rate, as had not
been the case for the earlier decade.

If the composition of exports in 1966 had been that of 1982 for the U.S.,
U.S. multinationals, and the world, and if the industry export growth rates of
the 1966-1982 period had been as they were, the comparisons would have come out
as follows:

In 1982, the U.S. multinationals continued to show the greatest bias
toward what had been the fast-growing export sectors of 1966-1982. That bias was
stronger than that of the U.S., which was, in turn, more oriented to such sectors than was the world as a whole. However, the rest of the world moved
toward the rapidly growing export industries a little faster than either the
U.S. as a country or U.S. multinationals.

Conclusion
The worldwide share of U.S. multinational firms (U.S. parent companies
plus their majority-owned affiliates) in manufactures exports has been nearly
stable since 1966. We do not know what happened to parent exports from the

U.S. before 1966, but the very large growth in affiliate exports makes it
probable that the total share of U.S. multinationals increased between 1957
and 1966. The early growth (1957—66) and later stability (1966-77) of overall

U.S. multinational export shares occurred while the share of the U.S. as a
geographical location declined substantially, from over 20 per cent to 13 or
14 per cent. Since 1977, there have been no clear trends in the shares of all

U.S. firms, of parents, and of majority-owned affiliates in the aggregate,
although the affiliate share continued to increase in developing countries.
Thus, U.S. multinationals conformed to the market performance of local firms,

-24—

both in the U.S. and in developed countries abroad during these years. This
is in contrast to their rapid expansion of exports prior to 1977. In those
years, they increased their exports from virtually all foreign locations at a
faster rate than other host-country firms, and their exports from the U.S.
faster than non—multinational U.S. firms.

This record is consistent with the view that American management and technology remained competitive, and is at variance with the argument sometimes made
that the fall in the share of the U.S. in world manufactures exports was due to
management failures and declines in technology. Perhaps the greater integration
of the world economy with respect to transport and communications, and hence to
the ease of managerial control over activities in distant locations, facilitated
the expansion of affiliate exports in the 1957-77 period, but even so, American
management should be credited with taking advantage of these opportunities. And
since 1977, American-controlled firms abroad have maintained their shares in a
rapidly growing world market, with powerful competition from Japan and some
other industrial countries and the advent of new competitors.
While we do not attempt to explain fully the decline in the U.S. country
share in export markets, we find that a substantial part of the changes in share
during a thirty-year period could be accounted for by movements in U.S. export
prices relative to those of its main competitors. That finding is further evidence, in our view, that much of the explanation for the export performance of
the U.S. as a geographical entity must be looked for in the factors that determine price levels. Over the short run, at least, these are presumably monetary,
fiscal, and related policies that affect exchange rates and rates of inflation.
The loss of U.S. shares between 1966 and 1982 extends to each of the

major branches of manufacturing. The shares of U.S. multinationals, however,

—25—

increased in foods, chemicals, and, relative to developed countries, in other

manufactures. They also showed smaller declines than those of the U.S. in
most other categories.
The comparative advantage of the U.S. has been in chemicals, machinery, and
transport equipment, and this is even more true for U.S. multinationals. These
have been fast-growing exports in world markets. They contributed substantially
to an export composition weighted in favor of products with relatively strong

demand growth. However, the growth of manufactures exports between 1966 and
1977 by all firms located in the U.S. fell short, by almost a third, of what
it would have been if the U.S. had maintained a constant share in each
industry and thus participated proportionately in the expansion of world trade
in each industry. The exports of U.S. multinationals also fell short of
constant-share growth, but by less than 10 per cent. Between 1977 and 1982, in
contrast to the earlier period, the export growth implied by constant shares

f or the U.S. and for U.S. multinationals was close to the world and
developed-country averages. That is, the composition of exports for both was
a little less favorable relative to other countries than it had been before.

The growth in U.S. exports in those years was close to or even slightly
greater than would have been produced by constant 1977 shares in each

industry, while that of U.S. multinationals was slightly less. Thus, in the
latest period for which we have data, when U.S. exports kept pace with those
of other countries, as they had failed to do in the preceding quarter-century,
the differentiation between U.S. multinationals and the U.S. as a country was
greatly reduced.

The major conclusion about U.S. multinationals is that they have continued

to hold a very steady share in world exports. That has been true while the

-26U.S. country share was declining and it remained true when U.S. country share
rose. The multinationals position in exports thus seems to have been quite
insulated from changes in home-country policies or circumstances.

Notes to Appendix Table U—la
aFor 1975 and 1966 comparable to 1957, SITC 0, 1, 4—8, less 041—045.
These totals include substantial amounts of non—manufactured products but
were the best approximations that could be made for these two years. For
other years the definition of manufactured products follows that used in
the BEA direct investment surveys. That definition is itself adapted from
the U.S. Census Bureau's ESIC. One important difference is that petroleum
refining is not included in manufacturing but is placed in a separate
petroleum industry that we do not include here.

aSource gives only total machinery (2,490). The breakdown between non—electrical and electrical machinery was estimated assuming that the ratio of exports to income (7,016 for non—
electrical machinery and 5,319 for electrical machinery) was identical in the two subgroups.
The export ratios in 1977 re 36.1% for non—electrical machinery and 33.4% for electrical
machinery (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1981, Tables III F.3 and III.H.2.
b0f which 90,898 were goods and 934 were services (Table III.E11).

Notes to Appendix Table U—4

1957: U.S. Department of Commerce (1960),
By industry, to countries other than U.S., p. 36.
To U.S., by product, Table 26, Manufactures and semimanufactures
plus meat products.
Foods = meat products
Metals = aluminum
Transport equipment = motor vehicles, aircraft, and equipment
Other = Newsprint and pulp; Scientific instruments, Rubber
products, and Other.
To U.S., by industry, total from Table 57 allocated between Canada
and Europe using total for all countries from Table 58 and allocated
by industry using product distribution and assuming that difference
between product and industry total consisted of fabricated metals
other than aluminum.
To All Countries, by Industry, breakdown between Canada and Europe
for all manufacturing from Table 58 and industry breakdown sum of
exports to U.S. and exports to other countries.
The share of metals is probably overstated in comparison to data for
later years because of the Inclusion of publicly—owned companies,
50% or more owned by U.S. citizens, but with no controlling U.S.
interest.

1966: U.S. Department of Commerce (1975), Tables L—1 through L—6.
1977: U.S. Department of Commerce (1981), Tables III.H4 and III.H5. All
affiliate export totals from the source multiplied by 1.0016, the
ratio of sales of all nonbank affiliates ($649,749 mill.) to sales
of reporting nonbank affiliates ($648,708 mill.), from U.S. Dept.
of Commerce (1981), Table A, p. 2.
1982: U.S. Department of Commerce (1985a), Tables III.E2, III.E4, and III.E5.
All affiliate export totals from the source multiplied by 1.010155,
the ratio of sales of all nonbank affiliates ($949,213 mill.) to
sales of reporting nonbank affiliates ($939,671 mill.), from U.S.
Dept. of Commerce (1985), Table 1, p. 2.
