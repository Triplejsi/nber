The Value of Informativeness for Contracting
Pierre Chaigneau, Alex Edmans, and Daniel Gottlieb
NBER Working Paper No. 20542
October 2014
JEL No. D86,J33
ABSTRACT
The informativeness principle demonstrates qualitative benefits to increasing signal precision. However,
it is difficult to quantify these benefits - and compare them against the costs of precision - since we
typically cannot solve for the optimal contract and analyze how it changes with informativeness. We
consider a standard agency model with risk-neutrality and limited liability, where the optimal contract
is a call option. The direct effect of reducing signal volatility is a fall in the value of the option, benefiting
the principal. The indirect effect is a change in the agent's effort incentives. If the original option is
sufficiently out-of-the-money, the agent can only beat the strike price if he exerts effort and there is
a high noise realization. Thus, a fall in volatility reduces effort incentives. As the agency problem
weakens, the gains from precision fall towards zero, potentially justifying pay-for-luck.

A major result in contract theory is the informativeness principle (Holmstrom
(1979), Shavell (1979), Gjesdal (1982), Grossman and Hart (1983), Kim (1995)). It
argues that the principal should maximize the precision of the performance measure
used to evaluate the agent. Greater precision (in the sense of second-order stochastic
dominance) allows the principal to use a cheaper contract to implement at least the
same e¤ort level. However, increasing informativeness is costly in practice. Investing
in a superior monitoring technology involves direct costs. Engaging in relative performance evaluation (“RPE”) involves the indirect costs of forgoing the bene…ts of
pay-for-luck documented by prior research (e.g. Oyer (2004), Raith (2008), Axelson
and Baliga (2009), and Gopalan, Milbourn, and Song (2010)). Potentially for this reason, numerous violations of RPE have been found in practice. Aggarwal and Samwick
(1999) and Murphy (1999) show that CEO pay is determined by absolute, rather than
relative performance. Jenter and Kanaan (2013) …nd an absence of RPE in CEO …ring
decisions. Whether these violations are an e¢ cient response to the indirect costs of
RPE is unclear. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) show pay-for-luck is strongest in
poorly-governed …rms, consistent with the view that it is ine¢ cient. Indeed, Bebchuk
and Fried (2004) argue that the absence of RPE is a key piece of evidence that CEO
compensation results from rent extraction by CEOs rather than e¢ cient contracting
with shareholders.1
The informativeness principle argues that there are qualitative bene…ts to increasing signal precision. However, for a principal to decide whether to invest in greater
precision, she must quantify these bene…ts –in particular, relate them to the underlying
parameters of the contracting problem –so that she can compare them against the cost
of precision. Similarly, to evaluate whether the general absence of RPE is e¢ cient, it is
useful to understand under which settings the bene…ts of informativeness are smallest,
and compare them against the cases in which RPE is particularly absent in reality.
Such quanti…cation is di¢ cult under the general framework in which the informativeness principle was derived. As is well-known (e.g. Grossman and Hart (1983)), in a
general setting it is not possible to solve for the optimal contract. We cannot analyze
precisely how the contract changes in response to increased informativeness, and thus
quantify the cost savings from contract redesign.
This paper addresses this open question. We consider the standard setting of risk

neutrality and limited liability on the agent, which allows us to take an optimal contracting approach. These restrictions lead to optimal contracts that we observe in
practice –as shown by Innes (1990), the agent has a call option on the signal. A fall in
the strike price increases the option’s delta and thus the agent’s e¤ort incentives, but
also augments the value of the option and thus his expected wage. Thus, the strike
price is the minimum possible to satisfy the agent’s incentive constraint.
We start by considering general signal distributions. We show that an increase
in informativeness has two e¤ects, each of which has a clear economic interpretation.
First, ignoring the incentive constraint, a fall in volatility reduces the value of the
option and thus the agent’s expected wage: the direct e¤ect. Second, the increase in
precision changes the agent’s incentives. The heart of the paper analyzes this incentive
e¤ect and shows how its direction depends on the model’s underlying parameters.
The agent’s e¤ort incentives stem from the di¤erence in value between two options
–the (less valuable) option that he receives when he shirks (“option-when-shirking”),
and the (more valuable) option that he receives when he works and improves the signal
distribution (“option-when-working”). Changes in signal precision a¤ect the values
of these options di¤erentially. If the option satis…es increasing di¤erences, i.e. e¤ort
and precision are complements (an increase in precision raises the sensitivity of the
option’s value to e¤ort), then a rise in informativeness augments e¤ort incentives. The
principal can thus increase the strike price of the option, i.e. reduce its delta, without
violating the agent’s incentive constraint. This strike price increase further reduces
the expected wage, and reinforces the …rst, direct e¤ect. In contrast, if the option
satis…es decreasing di¤erences, i.e. e¤ort and precision are substitutes, an increase in
informativeness weakens e¤ort incentives, o¤setting the …rst e¤ect. In the limit, it fully
o¤sets it, rendering the total bene…t of precision zero. The key result from the general
model is that we derive a simple condition, which holds for any signal distribution
and is easy to verify, that governs whether the option satis…es increasing or decreasing
di¤erences and thus whether a rise in informativeness raises or lowers e¤ort incentives.
We then consider signal distributions with a location parameter, i.e. where e¤ort
shifts the signal distribution rightwards but does not change its shape. Doing so allows
us to relate whether the option satis…es increasing or decreasing di¤erences to its initial
strike price, which in turn depends on the severity of the agency problem: a severe
agency problem (i.e. a high cost of e¤ort) requires the principal to set a low strike
price to induce e¤ort. We can thus relate the e¤ect of informativeness on incentives to
3

the underlying agency problem.
When the initial strike price is below a threshold, i.e. the agency problem is suf…ciently strong, then e¤ort and informativeness are complements. The intuition is as
follows. A decrease in informativeness, i.e. an increase in signal volatility that augments both tails of the distribution, raises the value of an option. The magnitude of the
gain is thus increasing in the asymmetry of the option’s payo¤. For a low initial strike
price, the signal distribution when the agent shirks is centered around the strike price.
Thus, the option’s payo¤ is highly asymmetric: high signal realizations lie to the right
of the strike price and lead to the option being exercised, and low signal realizations
lie to the left and lead to no exercise. As a result, when volatility increases, the agent
bene…ts from the greater probability of very high signal realizations and does not lose
from the greater probability of very low signal realizations, and so the value of the
option-when-shirking rises signi…cantly. Put di¤erently, for a low initial strike price,
the option-when-shirking is relatively close to at-the-money, and thus has a relatively
high vega (sensitivity to volatility).
In contrast, if the agent works, the signal distribution lies largely to the right of
the initial strike price, and so the payo¤ function is less asymmetric: most signal
realizations lead to the option being exercised. Thus, the agent bene…ts less from
increases in volatility – he gains from the growth in the right tail, but loses from
the growth in the left tail. Put di¤erently, for a low initial strike price, the optionwhen-working is signi…cantly in-the-money, and thus has a low vega. Thus, a fall in
informativeness increases the value of the option-when-shirking more than the optionwhen-working, and lowers the agent’s incentives. Intuitively, when volatility is high,
the agent’s e¤ort incentives are weak because, even if he shirked, he would still earn
a high wage if he received a positive shock. The agent is not worried about the fact
that, if he shirks and receives a negative shock, the signal will be very low, because his
payo¤ cannot fall below zero due to limited liability.
When the initial strike price is above a second (higher) threshold, i.e. the agency
problem is su¢ ciently weak, then e¤ort and informativeness are substitutes due to
the reverse intuition. The option-when-shirking is deeply out-of-the-money, and the
option-when-working is closer to at-the-money. Thus, the vega of the latter option is
greater, and its value increases with volatility faster than the option-when-shirking,
raising incentives. Intuitively, when the strike price is high, the agent will only receive
a positive wage if he exerts e¤ort and receives a su¢ ciently positive shock. When
4

volatility rises, such shocks are more likely, and so the agent is more likely to be paid
if he works. Thus, his e¤ort incentives increase.
For initial strike prices between the two thresholds, e¤ort and informativeness can
either be complements or substitutes. This is because, for general distributions, a
decrease in informativeness may not have a consistent e¤ect on the signal distribution.
While it is clear that it increases the left and right tails, thus leading to unambiguous
results for low or high initial strike prices, a fall in informativeness can have any e¤ect on
the center of the distribution. For example, it could shift some mass away from a tail, as
long as it also moves mass towards a more extreme tail point. Under a simple regularity
condition which guarantees that decreases in informativeness consistently shift mass
from the center of the distribution to the tails, the two thresholds now coincide at a
single point and there is no ambiguous intermediate region. A su¢ cient (although not
necessary) condition for regularity is that the signal distribution has a scale as well as
a location parameter –i.e. can be characterized by its mean and standard deviation,
as with the Normal, uniform, and logistic distributions. Intuitively, when volatility can
be fully characterized by a scale parameter, changes in this parameter have a consistent
e¤ect on the shape of the distribution, moving mass towards its tails.
Under regular distributions, the e¤ect of informativeness on incentives depends on
whether the initial strike price of the option is above or below a single threshold. Thus,
when incentives are strong (weak) to begin with, e.g. for CEOs (rank-and-…le workers),
an increase in informativeness further increases (reduces) incentives, amplifying (lowering) the gains from informativeness. In contrast, an analysis focusing only on the
direct e¤ect of informativeness, and ignoring the incentive constraint, would suggest
that the gains from informativeness are highest when the option is at-the-money –i.e.
a moderate initial strike price and a moderate agency problem.
In addition to studying whether a …rm should endogenously choose to increase
informativeness, our analysis also investigates the impact of exogenous changes in informativeness. An exogenous increase in volatility (see Gormley, Matsa, and Milbourn
(2013) and DeAngelis, Grullon, and Michenaud (2013) for natural experiments) will
increase (reduce) the e¤ort incentives of agents with out-of-the-money (in-the-money)
options. Thus, if …rms recontract in response to these exogenous shocks, …rms with
in-the-money options should increase their CEOs’incentives relative to …rms with outof-the-money options, either by granting additional options, or reducing the strike price

5

of new grants or existing options.2
For tractability, the analysis features a binary e¤ort level. In the continuous-e¤ort
analog, in order to implement a given e¤ort level, the contract must ensure that the
agent will not deviate to a slightly lower or a slightly higher e¤ort level (i.e. the
incentive constraint will be “local”). This situation resembles a binary model in which
the low e¤ort level is very close to the (implemented) high e¤ort level. In this case, the
threshold for the initial strike price –that determines whether informativeness increases
or decreases e¤ort – is the expected value of the signal. If the initial strike price is
above (below) this threshold, increases in informativeness lower (raise) the strike price
towards the threshold. Thus, improvements in informativeness (e.g. increases in stock
market e¢ ciency) move the strike price closer to the expected value of the signal, and
thus closer to at-the-money. Bebchuk and Fried (2004) argue that the almost universal
practice of granting at-the-money options is suboptimal and that out-of-the-money
options are more e¤ective because the agent is paid only if performance is very high
(see also Rappaport (1999)). Our analysis suggests that at-the-money options can be
close to optimal if informativeness is high. This result also suggests that accounting or
taxation considerations that favor at-the-money options need not induce suboptimal
contracting.
Dittmann, Maug, and Spalt (2013) also consider the incentive constraint when assessing the bene…ts of a speci…c form of increased informativeness –indexing stock and
options –and similarly show that indexation may weaken incentives. They use a quite
di¤erent setting, which re‡ects the di¤erent aims of each paper. Their primary goal is
to calibrate real-life contracts, and so their model incorporates risk aversion to allow
them to input risk aversion parameters into the calibration. However, under risk aversion, it is di¢ cult to solve for the optimal contract. They therefore restrict the contract
to comprising salary, stock, and options, and hold stock constant when changing the
contract to restore the agent’s incentives upon indexation. They acknowledge that the
actual savings from indexation will be di¤erent if the principal uses an initially optimal
contract and responds optimally to changes in incentives. In contrast, our primary
goal is theoretical. We incorporate risk neutrality and limited liability, allowing us to
take an optimal contracting approach and to achieve analytical solutions. In addition,
2

Acharya, John, and Sundaram (2000) also study the repricing of stock options theoretically,
although in response to changes in the mean rather than volatility of the signal. Brenner, Sundaram,
and Yermack (2000) analyze repricing empirically.

6

our model allows the analysis of reductions in volatility through other means than
indexation, for example investing in a superior monitoring technology.
Other explanations for pay-for-luck have been proposed in the literature, partially
reviewed by Edmans and Gabaix (2009). Oyer (2004) shows that pay-for-luck may be
optimal if the value of workers’outside options vary with economic conditions and if
re-contracting is costly. Raith (2008) shows that it may be preferable to base compensation on measures of output rather than input when the agent has private information
on the production technology. Axelson and Baliga (2009) argue that, for contracts to
be renegotiation-proof, the manager must have private information that causes him
to have a di¤erent view from the board on the value of his long-term pay. Industry
performance is an example of such information, and so it may be e¢ cient not to …lter it
out. Gopalan, Milbourn, and Song (2010) show that tying the CEO’s pay to industry
performance induces him to choose the …rm’s industry exposure correctly.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 presents the model. Section 2 shows that
the optimal contract takes the form of a call option. Section 3 derives the gains from a
reduction in the variance of the performance measure. Section 4 concludes. Appendix
A contains all proofs not in the main text.

1

The Model

We consider a standard principal-agent model with risk neutrality and limited liability,
similar to Innes (1990). The timing is as follows. At time t = 1, the principal (…rm)
o¤ers a contract W to the agent (manager). At t = 0, the agent chooses his e¤ort level
e 2 f0; eg. E¤ort of e = 0 is of zero cost to the agent, and e = e costs him C > 0. We
will sometimes refer to e = e as “high e¤ort” or “working”, and e = 0 as “low e¤ort”
or “shirking”.
At t = 1, the agent’s contribution to …rm value (“output”) q is realized. As in the
literature on performance measurement (e.g. Baker (1992)), output is not contractible:
for example, it is di¢ cult to measure an employee’s contribution independently of his
colleagues’. Instead, contracts can depend on a performance measure (“signal”)
s=q+ ;
where

is a mean-zero random variable that is uncorrelated with e¤ort: E [ je] = 0.
7

For example, may be a market or industry shock, the contribution of other workers,
or measurement error.
We assume that output q is not contractible and the contract depends on a separate signal s, so that we can change signal precision without a¤ecting output volatility.
However, the model allows for the case in which output is contractible, which corresponds to the degenerate distribution concentrated at = 0 (i.e. signal equals output).
Our results also hold in the case in which output equals the signal, and so the analysis
considers changes in the variance of output.
Conditional on e¤ort e, the signal s is continuously distributed on the real line
according to the probability density function (“PDF”) f (sje), although it needs not
have full support over the real line. Let F (sje) denote the cumulative distribution
function (“CDF”) of s. A high signal is good news about e¤ort in the sense of the
strict monotone likelihood ratio property (“MLRP”). Formally, for all and for all
signals s1 and s0 with s1 > s0 ,
f (s0 je)
f (s1 je)
>
:
f (s1 j0)
f (s0 j0)
Strict MLRP implies that the distribution of the signal is ordered according to strict
…rst-order stochastic dominance (“FOSD”): F (sj0) > F (sje) 8 s; . Combined with
E [ je] = 0, the above also implies that e¤ort improves output in terms of FOSD.
The real-valued parameter , which lies in an interval , captures the informativeness or precision of the signal, and orders the distributions in terms of second-order
stochastic dominance. Formally, the mean of the signal is independent of , and

sense of mean-preserving spreads.
Our analysis solves for the optimal contract for each given level of precision . This
approach applies to settings in which signal precision depends on exogenous forces
(such as technological change); the analysis derives empirical predictions on how these
changes a¤ect the optimal contract. Our approach can easily be extended to settings in
which the principal can choose the level of precision at a cost ( ). Under the inter-

8

pretation that arises from measurement error, removing the shock corresponds to improving the monitoring technology at cost ( ). For example, Cornelli, Kominek, and
Ljungqvist (2013) show that boards of directors engage in extensive (and thus costly)
monitoring to gather soft information on the CEO’s competence, strategic choice, and
e¤ort. Under the interpretation that is a market or industry shock, increasing
corresponds to relative performance evaluation (RPE), in which case the cost ( )
stems from two sources. First, it can arise from the literal cost of implementing RPE.
While the actual calculation of industry performance, given a peer group, is relatively
costless, the determination of the peer group may involve the hiring of compensation
consultants. Second, the cost can also represent the loss of the bene…ts of pay-for-luck
highlighted by prior work, e.g. Oyer (2004), Raith (2008), Axelson and Baliga (2009),
and Gopalan, Milbourn, and Song (2010).
The discount rate is normalized to zero. Given a contract W ( ) and a level of e¤ort
e, the agent’s expected wage is
E [W (s) je] =

W (s) f (sje) ds:

The agent is risk-neutral and so maximizes his expected wage, less the cost of e¤ort.
His reservation utility is zero. The principal is also risk-neutral and chooses a contract
W ( ) and an e¤ort level e to maximize expected output E [q] less the expected wage
E [W ].
Following Innes (1990), we make two assumptions on the set of feasible contracts.
First, the agent is protected by limited liability: W (s)
0 8 s. Second, payperformance sensitivity lies between 0 and 1:
W (s + )

W (s) and s +

W (s + )

for all s and all
0. These constraints must be satis…ed if the agent can freely
borrow to arti…cially increase output and the principal can freely destroy output. If
the constraint on the left did not hold, the agent would arti…cially increase output,
increasing the signal and thus his payo¤. If the constraint on the right did not hold,
the principal would exercise her control rights to “burn” output, reducing the signal

9

and increasing her payo¤. These constraints can be expressed as
1

W (s + )

W (s)

8 . It thus follows that W ( ) is Lipschitz continuous and, therefore, di¤erentiable
almost everywhere. Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume that the contract
W ( ) is a cadlag function satisfying 0 W 0 (s) 1 at all points of di¤erentiability.3
In the …rst best, e¤ort is veri…able. There is no incentive constraint and only a
participation constraint. If the principal wishes to induce high e¤ort, the participation
constraint is given by:
(3)
E[W (s)je] C 0:
To satisfy (3), the principal pays an expected wage E [W (s) je] that equals the agent’s
cost of e¤ort C. Thus, if
E [qje] E [qj0] > C;
(4)
high e¤ort is optimal for the principal. We assume (4) throughout, else even under the
…rst-best, the principal would not want to induce e¤ort.
In the second best, the agent’s e¤ort is unveri…able and so the contract must satisfy
an incentive constraint. The agent will exert e¤ort if and only if:
E[W (s)je]

E [W (s)j0]

Following standard arguments, this incentive constraint will bind, in which case the
participation constraint will be slack and can be ignored in the analysis that follows.

We will show in Lemma 1 that X exists and is unique. The intuition behind (6) is
that, if the agent is given a call option on s, X is the strike price such that working
increases the value of the agent’s option by an amount equal to the cost of e¤ort, so
that the incentive constraint is satis…ed with equality.

The …rst term, E [qje] E [qj0], is the bene…t to the principal of inducing e = e. The
second term is the cost of the contract required to do so. If (7) did not hold, the
principal would allow the agent to shirk, in which case the problem would be trivial
and the contract would involve a constant wage.
Given informativeness , the principal’s problem is to choose a contract W ( ) to
minimize the expected wage E [W (s) je] subject to the agent’s incentive and limited
liability constraints, plus the constraints on the slope of the contract:

(10)

Our contracting problem is the dual to the one in Innes (1990). In his model, the
agent (entrepreneur) chooses a …nancing contract subject to his own incentive constraint and the participation constraint of the principal (investor). Here, the principal
(…rm) chooses an employment contract subject to the incentive and participation constraints of the agent (manager). In both models, the optimal contract has the same
form; the only di¤erence is in the division of the rents. Since Innes studies a …nancing
setting, the optimal contract for the principal is debt. Thus, the agent has equity,
which is a call option on the …rm’s assets; here, we will show that the agent receives a
call option on the signal.
Another di¤erence is that Innes features a continuous action set. His focus was
to derive the form of the optimal contract and thus he wishes to do so in the most
general setting. Our goal is di¤erent: given that the optimal contract is a call option,
we study how changes in informativeness a¤ect the agent’s incentives and thus the
strike price. We thus specialize to a binary e¤ort level. With a continuous e¤ort level,
a change in informativeness may alter the optimal e¤ort level. It is well known that
solving for the optimal e¤ort level in addition to the cheapest contract that induces a
given e¤ort level is extremely complex (see, e.g., Grossman and Hart (1983)), and thus
many papers focus on the implementation of a given e¤ort level. For example, Biais et
11

al. (2010) consider a binary e¤ort choice and conditions to guarantee that high e¤ort
is optimal, as in our setting, and Dittmann and Maug (2007) and Dittmann, Maug,
and Spalt (2010, 2013) consider the implementation of a given e¤ort level out of a
continuum. (Indeed, Innes (1990) does not solve for the optimal e¤ort level or study
how it is a¤ected by the parameters of the setting, but shows that an optimum exists.)
Edmans and Gabaix (2011) show that, if the bene…ts of e¤ort are multiplicative in …rm
size and the …rm is su¢ ciently large, it is always optimal for the principal to implement
the highest e¤ort level and so the optimal e¤ort level is indeed …xed. We thus consider
a binary e¤ort setting where high e¤ort is optimal.

The Optimal Contract

This section solves for the optimal contract for a given level of informativeness . The
analysis is similar to Innes (1990). Our main results will come in Section 3, which
analyzes the gains from increasing .
Let W ( ) denote the optimal contract for a given . Lemma 1 establishes that
W ( ) is a call option on s, where the strike price X is chosen to satisfy the incentive
constraint (6).
Lemma 1 (Optimal contract): For each given , there exists a unique optimal contract, characterized by e = e, and
W (s) = maxf0; s

X g;

(11)

where X is determined by the unique solution of (6).
The setting is slightly di¤erent from Innes (1990), since the principal is contracting
on a signal rather than output. We show that the Innes (1990) result of the optimality
of a call option extends to this case, and the intuition is the same. The absolute value
of the likelihood ratio is highest in the tails of the distribution of s, so the signal is
most informative about e¤ort in the tails. The left tail cannot be used for incentive
purposes due to limited liability, and so incentives are concentrated in the right tail.
This maximizes the likelihood that positive payments are received by a working agent.
With an upper bound on the slope, the optimal contract involves call options on s with
the maximum feasible slope, i.e. W 0 (s) = 1.
12

Lemma 2 below shows that the strike price falls with the cost of e¤ort, which
parameterizes the severity of the agency problem.
Lemma 2 (E¤ect of e¤ort cost on strike price): Let X be the strike price in the
optimal contract for a given . Then, X is strictly decreasing in the cost of e¤ort C.

The Value of Informativeness

This section calculates the gains from increasing informativeness. Section 3.1 considers general signal distributions and provides a condition under which increases in
informativeness raise e¤ort incentives. Section 3.2 studies distributions with a location
parameter and shows that whether this condition is satis…ed depends on the initial
strike price and thus the severity of the agency problem. Section 3.3 graphically illustrates the bene…ts of informativeness for the Normal distribution. It also proves
analytically that, for this distribution, the bene…ts from informativeness are monotonically increasing in the cost of e¤ort, and thus monotonically decreasing in the initial
strike price.

The …rst component is the direct e¤ect, @@ E [W (s)je]. Holding constant the strike

that this e¤ect is negative. This reduction in the cost of compensation is the bene…t
of informativeness highlighted by Bebchuk and Fried (2004) in their argument that
the lack of RPE is ine¢ cient. In the Holmstrom (1979) setting of a risk-averse agent,
an increase in informativeness reduces the risk borne by the agent and thus allows
the principal to lower the expected wage without violating the agent’s participation
constraint. In our setting of risk neutrality and limited liability, an increase in precision
reduces the value of the option.

The following de…nition will be useful:

and e are
complements if g ( ; e) satis…es increasing di¤erences, substitutes if g ( ; e) satis…es
decreasing di¤erences, and neutral if g ( ; e) satis…es both increasing and decreasing
di¤erences.
The increasing di¤erences condition (13) means that the incremental gain (i.e., increase in g) from e¤ort, g ( ; eH ) g ( ; eL ), is increasing in : e¤ort and informativeness
are complements in terms of their e¤ect on g. Conversely, decreasing di¤erences means
that the incremental gain from e¤ort is decreasing in : Thus, e¤ort and informativeness are substitutes. Indeed, increasing (decreasing) di¤erences is the most common
de…nition of complementarity (substitutability).4 In our setting, if g is di¤erentiable,
increasing di¤erences is equivalent to the single-crossing condition:

We are concerned with how changes in precision a¤ect the incentive constraint (5).
The agent’s incentives stem from the fact that exerting e¤ort increases the value of his
option. If he works, his option is worth E [W (s) je]; we refer to this as an “optionwhen-working.”If he shirks, he receives an “option-when-shirking”worth E [W (s) j0].
His e¤ort incentives are given by the di¤erence in the values of these options, i.e.
E [W (s) je]

E [W (s) j0] :

(14)

There is a very large literature using these concepts for understanding outcomes of games – e.g.
Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985) and Milgrom and Roberts (1990).

14

Since a change in precision a¤ects the option-when-working and the option-whenshirking to di¤erent degrees, it a¤ects the agent’s e¤ort incentives (14). When precision
and e¤ort are complements, i.e. E [W (s)je] satis…es increasing di¤erences, increases in
precision augment the agent’s e¤ort incentives:

(15)

We thus wish to understand the conditions under which E [W (s)je] satis…es increasing
di¤erences. We do so by using integration by parts (see Appendix A) to rewrite the
agent’s expected wage as
E [W (s)je] = E [sje]

where the last equality follows from integration by parts. Therefore, equation (16)
can be interpreted as the put-call parity equation. The agent’s call option equals the
expected value of the signal, minus the strike price, plus the value of a put option. Let

By second-order stochastic dominance (equation (1)), the value of the put option is

decreasing in ( @X ( ; e) 0).5
To study whether E [W (s)je] satis…es increasing di¤erences, we examine each of the
three terms on the right-hand side (“RHS”) of (16). While E [sje] depends on e, it is
independent of since changes in represent mean-preserving spreads. In addition, X
depends on but not e. Thus, and e are neutral in their e¤ect on both of these terms,
RX
and non-neutral only in their e¤ect on the third term 1 F (sje) ds. This observation
leads to the following Lemma:
5

In the Black-Scholes model, we have a strict inequality. This is because the Black-Scholes model
assumes a lognormal distribution for stock returns, so an increase in precision (which corresponds
to a decrease in volatility) a¤ects the whole distribution. However, in our setting with a general
distribution, a change in may only a¤ect the part of the distribution above the strike price X ,
where the put option has zero payo¤, and so its value does not change.

RX
satis…es increasing di¤erences if and only if the area under the CDF, 1 F (sje) ds,
satis…es increasing di¤erences.
The usefulness of Lemma 3 lies in the fact that, while the value of the call option
(16) involves several terms, it is relatively easy to verify whether the area under the
RX
CDF 1 F (sje) ds satis…es increasing di¤erences. While it may seem intuitive that
the value of the call option satis…es increasing di¤erences if and only if the value of
the put option satis…es increasing di¤erences, the value of Lemma 3 is that we can
check whether expected pay satis…es increasing di¤erences by studying a single term
RX
F (sje) ds –not that this term can be interpreted as the value of a put option. The
1
condition in Lemma 3 is simple to check and general: it holds for all signal distributions
that satisfy MLRP (so that the optimal contract is a call option). De…nition 1 then
allows us to determine the e¤ect of informativeness on the strike price X :
RX
Proposition 1 (E¤ect of informativeness on strike price): Let X ( ; e)
F (sje) ds:

The optimal strike price X is increasing in informativeness if X ( ; e) satis…es increasing di¤erences at X , decreasing in informativeness if X ( ; e) satis…es decreasing
di¤erences at X , and constant if it satis…es both increasing and decreasing di¤erences
at X .
When precision and e¤ort are complements, exerting e¤ort augments the value of
the call option by a greater amount when precision is high. As a result, the agent’s
marginal bene…t from e¤ort (equation (14)) is increasing in informativeness. Increases
in precision loosen the incentive constraint and allow the principal to increase the strike
price while still inducing e¤ort. Thus, in addition to the direct bene…t of informativeness (it reduces the expected wage, holding constant the strike price X ), the principal
further bene…ts from its incentive e¤ect (it allows the strike price X to increase, further
reducing the expected wage). Proposition 1 in turn leads to Corollary 1 below.

Even when dX

outweigh it. The total e¤ect dd E [W (s)je] is always weakly negative, i.e. increasing
precision weakly reduces the expected wage. This result arises from revealed preference.
If reducing precision reduced the expected wage, the principal would have added in
randomness to the contract, and so the initial contract would not have been optimal.
Even though the incentive e¤ect cannot outweigh the direct e¤ect, it is still important
to consider as it a¤ects the optimal level of precision that the principal should choose,
since increasing precision is costly. Indeed, it is possible that the incentive e¤ect exactly
o¤sets the direct e¤ect, and so that the total gains from informativeness equal exactly
zero: see Appendix B for an example.6

While we consider the e¤ect of changes in signal informativeness, Chaigneau, Edmans, and Gottlieb (2014) derive a general condition for whether the addition of a new signal has strictly positive
value for contracting.

3.2

Distributions in the Location Family

Section 3.1 shows that, with general distributions, the e¤ect of precision on incentives
depends on whether e¤ort and precision are complements or substitutes. We now gradually add more structure to the signal distribution, which allows us to relate whether
we have complements or substitutes – and thus the e¤ect of precision on the agent’s
incentives –to the underlying parameters of the agency problem.
Since the expected signal is strictly increasing in e¤ort, we can always normalize
e¤ort to be measured in units of the average signal: e = E[sje]. Hence, for any signal
distribution, we can write the signal as s = e + "; where we de…ne the noise term "
as the di¤erence between e¤ort and the signal. Thus, if G (") denotes the CDF of
the noise, we have G (") = G (s e) = F (sje). While the conditional mean of noise
is zero (E["je] = 0), higher moments of " may, in general, depend on the e¤ort e.
We now assume that the whole distribution of noise G (not only its …rst moment) is
independent of e. This assumption is equivalent to specifying that the distribution of
s has a location parameter –changes in e¤ort shift the location of the distribution but
do not change its shape.
To ensure that lim"& 1 G (") and lim"%1 G (") are di¤erentiable with respect to ,
we make the technical assumptions that G is di¤erentiable with respect to and that
the sequences fG ( n)gn2N ; @G
( n) n2N ; fG (n)gn2N ; @G
(n) n2N are uniformly
@
@
convergent. These assumptions are automatically satis…ed if the noise has bounded
support and are also satis…ed under standard unbounded distributions (such as the
Normal, logistic, Cauchy, and Laplace distributions).
With a slight abuse of terminology, we say that s belongs to a location family if the
two above conditions –independence between e and and the technical di¤erentiability
condition –are satis…ed. When the signal belongs to the location family, we can show
that whether e¤ort and informativeness are complements or substitutes depends on the
level of the initial strike price:

The intuition is as follows. Recall from inequality (15) that the e¤ect of informativeness on e¤ort depends on its di¤erential e¤ects on the values of the option-whenworking and the option-when-shirking. We thus study how changes in informativeness
a¤ect the value of each option.
A decrease in informativeness (from to 0 ) increases both the left and right tails
of the signal distribution. If the initial strike price of the option is su¢ ciently low
b1 ), then the signal distribution upon shirking lies on both sides of X . The
(X < X
agent bene…ts from high signal realizations (s > X ), since the option-when-shirking
is in-the-money (“ITM”) and so he exercises it, but does not lose from low signals
(s < X ) as he does not exercise the option. Thus, when informativeness falls, a shirking
agent bene…ts from the growth in the right tail, but does not lose from the growth in
the left tail, and so the value of the option-when-shirking increases signi…cantly.
Since the signal distribution has a location parameter, working shifts it rightwards.
b1 , the signal distribution upon working is mostly to the right of X ,
Thus, for X < X
and remains this way after informativeness falls. Since the option usually ends up ITM,
the agent usually exercises it. Thus, a working agent bene…ts from the growth in the
right tail and loses from the growth in the left tail, and so the value of the option-whenworking is relatively unchanged. Put di¤erently, reductions in informativeness increase
the value of an option due to its asymmetric payo¤: the agent bene…ts from s > X ,
but does not lose from s < X . When X is low and the agent shirks, the mean
signal 0 is close to the kink X and the agent bene…ts from the asymmetry. When
the agent works, the mean signal e is far from the kink X , and so he enjoys little
asymmetry. Overall, a fall in raises the value of the option-when-shirking more than
the option-when-working and reduces e¤ort incentives: e¤ort and informativeness are
complements. In simple language, the agent thinks “I’m not going to bother working
hard, because even if I do, I might be unlucky and so pro…ts will be low. I might as well
shirk, because even if I get unlucky and pro…ts become very low, that doesn’t matter,
because I can’t get paid less than zero no matter how low pro…ts get.”
The existence of a location parameter is central to the above intuition, as it means
that e¤ort shifts the signal distribution rightward and reduces the probability of very
low signals (s < X ). If, in contrast, e¤ort increased the dispersion of the signal in
addition to its mean, it could increase the probability of very low signals. Thus, the
e¤ect on e¤ort incentives would be ambiguous.
b2 ), the signal distribution upon shirking
For a su¢ ciently high strike price (X > X
19

is mostly to the left of X –and remains this way even after informativeness falls and
the right tail expands. Thus, the option-when-shirking remains usually OTM and its
value is little changed. In contrast, if the agent works, this shifts the signal distribution
rightward and so decreases in informativeness now push the right tail above X . Thus,
when informativeness falls, a working agent bene…ts from the growth in the right tail
(since he can now exercise the option) but does not lose from the growth in the left tail
(since he does not exercise the option). Put di¤erently, when X is high and the agent
works, the expected signal e is close to the kink X and the agent bene…ts from the
asymmetry. When the agent shirks, the expected signal 0 is far from the kink X , and
so he enjoys little asymmetry. Overall, a fall in informativeness raises the value of the
option-when-working more than the option-when-shirking, and increases the agent’s
e¤ort incentives: e¤ort and informativeness are substitutes. In simple language, the
agent thinks “If informativeness were high, I wouldn’t bother working because the
target X is so high that I wouldn’t meet it, even if I did work. But, now that the
signal is more noisy, I will work –because if I do, and I get lucky, I’ll meet the target.”
From Lemma 2, the initial strike price X is decreasing in the cost of e¤ort, and
thus the severity of the agency problem. When the agency problem is mild (severe),
the initial strike price is high (low); increases in informativeness reduce (increase) e¤ort
incentives, causing the strike price to fall (rise).
However, without any restrictions on the distribution, it is unclear how changes in
b1 and X

a¤ect the tails of the distribution between X
is that, for arbitrary distributions, decreases in precision in a SOSD sense need not
consistently shift mass from the center of the distribution towards the tails. It may be
that a fall in shifts some mass away from a tail, as long as it also moves mass towards
a more extreme tail point. Figure 1 shows that, while a fall in increases G (s) for
low s below a threshold s1 (i.e. increases the left tail) and increases 1 G (s) for high
s above a threshold s2 > s1 (i.e. increases the right tail), the e¤ect of on G (s) is

In addition to being su¢ cient for regularity, the presence of a scale parameter also

in volatility . We can thus examine how changes in a¤ect the values of the two
options using the familiar concept of the option “vega”: the sensitivity of its value to

. In turn, the vega of each option will depend on the initial strike price, and thus the
underlying parameters of the agency problem. With a scale parameter, equation (15)

@
The left-hand side (“LHS”) of inequality (19) – the vega of the option-when-working
minus the vega of the option-when-shirking – represents the e¤ect of changes in
on incentives. The vega of an option is always positive, highest for an at-the-money
(“ATM”) option (see Claim 2 in Appendix C7 ), and declines when the option moves
either ITM or OTM. Thus, the vega of the option-when-working is highest at X = e,

2
When the initial strike price is high (low), a fall in volatility reduces (increases) e¤ort
incentives, causing the strike price to fall (rise). In the current discrete model, there
are two e¤ort levels, e and 0. In a continuous-e¤ort analog, where the principal wishes
to implement e¤ort of e, the contract must ensure induce the agent to exert e¤ort of e
rather than e + " or e ", i.e. the incentive constraint must be “local”. In our discrete
model, a local incentive constraint resembles the case in which the (implemented) high
b ' 0. Moreover,
e¤ort level (e) is very close to the low e¤ort level (0). If e ' 0, then X
since the contract induces the agent to exert e¤ort of e, the mean value of the signal
is e and so an ATM option will have a strike price of e ' 0. Thus, if the initial strike

price is higher (lower) than X
in stock market e¢ ciency) will lower (raise) the optimal strike price towards 0, i.e.

It is well-known that for lognormal distributions, the vega is highest for ATM options. Claim 2
in Appendix C extends this result to all distributions with a location and scale parameter.

bring the option closer to ATM. (Indeed, Appendix E sketches a continuous e¤ort
model which shows that increases in informativeness bring the option closer to ATM.)
Bebchuk and Fried (2004) argue that the almost universal practice of granting ATM
options is ine¢ cient and that OTM options would be cheaper for the …rm. Similarly,
Rappaport (1999) advocates OTM options as they reward the agent only for exceptional
performance. However, such views ignore the incentive e¤ect: OTM options have lower
deltas and so more would be required to achieve incentive compatibility. Murphy (2002)
notes that ITM options would provide the strongest incentives, but that the tax code
discourages such options. One interpretation is that the tax code leads to …rms choosing
ATM options when ITM options may be more e¢ cient. Our analysis instead suggests
that increases in informativeness lead to options optimally being close to ATM.8
In addition, Proposition 2 suggests that exogenous increases in informativeness will
have di¤erent e¤ects on the incentives of agents depending on the moneyness of their
options. In particular, it will reduce (increase) the incentives of agents with OTM
(ITM) options. Thus, …rms may wish to reduce the strike prices of OTM options to
restore incentives. Option repricing is documented empirically by Brenner, Sundaram,
and Yermack (2000), although they do not study if it is prompted by falls in volatility.
Acharya, John, and Sundaram (2000) also study the repricing of options theoretically,
although in responses to changes in the mean rather than volatility of the signal.
Finally, note that the above analysis takes an optimal contracting approach, so the
slope of the contract is the maximum possible without violating the constraint (10).
We thus have W 0 (s) = 1: the agent is the residual “claimant” of any increase in the
signal (as long as s X ). Thus, the principal changes X to ensure that the incentive
constraint binds. An alternative approach is to restrict the contract to comprising ATM
options, e.g. for accounting or tax reasons9 , and instead meet the incentive constraint
by varying the slope of the contract. Appendix D demonstrates an analogous result for
b = e and so e¤ort and precision are
this case. With ATM options, we have X = e X

substitutes. An increase in informativeness requires the number of options granted to
8

Hall and Murphy (2000) restrict the contract to consist of options, rather than taking an optimal
contracting approach, and calibrate the optimal strike price depending on the CEO’s risk aversion,
the proportion of his wealth in stock, and the proportion of his wealth in options. They show that, in
most cases, the range of optimal strike prices includes the current stock price, i.e. corresponds to an
ATM option. In contrast, Dittmann and Yu (2011) feature a risk-taking as well as e¤ort decision, and
restrict the contract to consisting of …xed salary, stock, and options. They show that ITM options are
typically optimal.

increase to maintain incentive compatibility. This augments the expected wage, just
like a decrease in the strike price, and so the total e¤ect of informativeness on expected
b
pay is less than the direct e¤ect. Thus, the results of the core model, where X > X,
extend to the case of ATM options.

The total e¤ect dE[Wd (s)je] combines these direct and incentive e¤ects. While the direct e¤ect is initially increasing in X, this is outweighed by the fact that the incentive
e¤ect is initially decreasing in X. Thus, in Figure 3, the total gains from increased
informativeness are monotonically decreasing in X. Indeed, focusing on the Normal
distribution allows us to prove this result analytically: C is the exogenous parameter that drives X, and Proposition 4 shows that the gains from informativeness are
monotonically increasing in C.

An analysis focusing purely on the direct e¤ect would suggest that the gains from
informativeness are greatest when the initial option is ATM, which in turn corresponds
to a moderate strike price and a moderate cost of e¤ort. In contrast, considering
the total e¤ect (which incorporates the incentive e¤ect) shows that the gains from
informativeness are monotonically increasing in the severity of the agency problem.
Thus, workers with high-powered incentives (such as CEOs) should be evaluated more
precisely than those with low-powered incentives (such as rank-and-…le workers).
Corollary 3 shows that, as the cost of e¤ort goes to zero, the gains from informativeness also approach zero, as does the total gain relative to the direct e¤ect.

As the moral hazard problem becomes weaker, the total e¤ect of informativeness
becomes very small relative to the direct e¤ect. Thus, ignoring the incentive e¤ect
and considering only the direct e¤ect would substantially overestimate the gains from
informativeness. Indeed, in Figure 3, the direct e¤ect signi…cantly overestimates the
total gains for su¢ ciently large X. For example, for
= 1 and X = 2 (which is
only one standard deviation away from the expected performance of e = 1), the gains
from a marginal change in are 10:8 times larger with the direct e¤ect than with
the total e¤ect. Thus, even for non-extreme parameter values, gains from improved
informativeness can be much lower if the incentive e¤ect is taken into account. This
ratio becomes much greater for higher X, because the total bene…ts of informativeness
fall towards zero.

Conclusion

This paper studies the principal’s bene…ts from increasing the informativeness of the
signal used to evaluate the agent. The direct e¤ect is that higher signal precision
reduces the value of the agent’s option and thus expected pay. The core focus of the
29

paper is on the indirect e¤ect –how changes in precision a¤ect the agent’s incentives.
By taking an optimal contracting approach, we can be speci…c on how the contract
changes in response to increases in informativeness. With general signal distributions,
we show that, if e¤ort and informativeness are substitutes, increases in precision weaken
the agent’s incentives. Thus, the principal must reduce the strike price of the option
to preserve e¤ort incentives, increasing the cost of compensation and o¤setting the
direct e¤ect. Indeed, we derive a simple condition that governs whether e¤ort and
informativeness are substitutes or complements, that holds for all distributions that
satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property.
Focusing on signal distributions with a location parameter allows us to relate
whether e¤ort and informativeness are substitutes or complements to the initial strike
price of the option, and thus the severity of the underlying agency problem. When the
initial strike price is above a threshold, i.e. incentives are low-powered to begin with,
an increase in informativeness reduces the agent’s e¤ort incentives and thus the bene…ts
of informativeness. The principal therefore optimally invests less in improving informativeness, potentially rationalizing the scarcity of relative performance evaluation for
some agents in reality.
In contrast, if the initial strike price is below a second (lower) threshold, i.e. incentives are high-powered to begin with, an increase in informativeness augments the
agent’s e¤ort incentives. This provides an additional gain from informativeness over
and above the direct e¤ect of reducing volatility traditionally focused upon. Thus, the
gains from informativeness depend critically on the strength of incentives, and thus
the magnitude of the moral hazard problem to begin with. For regular signal distributions, where an increase in informativeness consistently moves mass from the tails
of the distribution to the center, both thresholds coincide at a single point. This regularity condition is satis…ed by any distribution with a location and scale parameter,
such as the Normal, uniform, and logistic distributions. Furthermore, with a Normal
distribution, the bene…ts from informativeness are monotonically increasing in the cost
of e¤ort, and thus the severity of the agency problem. Finally, if incentive constraints
are local, i.e. the implemented e¤ort level is close to other feasible e¤ort levels, then
increases in informativeness cause the strike price to move closer to at-the-money.

Proofs

Proof of Lemma 1
Denote the lower bound of the support of s by s, and the upper bound by s. We
will adopt a two-step approach. First, we solve for the optimal contract for a …xed
minimum payment W (s) = Z 0. As we will show, the solution involves an “option”
with a …xed minimum payment Z. Then, we will show that the ‡oor is zero.
Formally, for a given constant Z 0, consider the following “relaxed”program:

Introduce the auxiliary variables y (s) W
H (W; y; ; ; s)

W (s)f (sje) + [W (s) [f (sje)

f (sj0)]

C] + (s) y(s);

where W are state variables, y are control variables, are co-state variables, and is
a (state-independent) Lagrange multiplier. The necessary optimality conditions are:

where LR (s) ff (sj0)
is the likelihood ratio, which we assumed to be increasing. Thus,
the LHS of the last inequality above is decreasing in s while the RHS is constant. Hence,
there exists a threshold s 2 [s; s] such that _ (s) > 0 for s < s and _ (s) < 0 for
s > s . (Notice that if s = s or s = s, one of these intervals vanishes). Therefore,
is bell-shaped, with a unique maximum at s and (at most) two local minima –one at
s and and another at s.
We claim that s < s, i.e. is increasing 8 s if s = s. Then, the transversality condition (s) = 0 and condition (24) implies that W (s) is constant (W (s) = W (s) = Z
8 s), which violates the incentive constraint. Thus, it cannot be a solution.
There are two possible solutions depending on whether (s) 0 or (s) < 0. In
the former case, we must have (s) > 0 8 s 2 (s; s) (since the only candidates for
global minima are s and s and (s)
0 = (s)). In the latter case, there exists a
threshold s 2 (s; s ) such that (s) < 0 if s < s and (s) > 0 if s > s . We can
combine both cases by letting s 2 [s; s ) denote the threshold below which we have
(s) < 0. The solution is then

W (s) = Z + max fs

(26)

s ; 0g

for some s 2 [s; s). This concludes the …rst part of the proof.
It remains to be shown that the solution entails Z = 0. Substitute the agent’s
payment from (26) in the principal’s expected cost

Note that monotonicity is automatically satis…ed under (26) and, as before, the limited

subject to (27). Since Z increases the expression in (28) but does not a¤ect the incentive
constraint in (27), the solution entails Z = 0. Thus, the solution of the relaxed program
is
W (s) = max fs s ; 0g ;
With this contract, and setting X = s , we show in the proof of Lemma 2 that
Rs
the LHS of the incentive constraint (5) becomes X [F (sj0) F (sje)] ds. By FOSD,
the LHS of (27) is decreasing in X . Since both the expected cost to the principal and
the LHS of the incentive constraint are strictly decreasing in X , the optimal level of
X satis…es the incentive constraint with equality:
Z

Finally, we establish that X exists. Evaluated at X = s, the LHS of the incentive

is …rst-best e¢ cient, the expression in (29) exceeds C. Thus, the intermediate value
theorem and the monotonicity of the LHS ensure that a unique solution to (30) exists.
In sum, we have established that the optimal contract is
W (s) = maxfs

where the strike price X is such that the incentive constraint holds with equality.

Suppose that, under low e¤ort, s is uniformly distributed in [0; 1] for any level of

F (sj0) = s 1 (0 s 1) :
This assumption is for concreteness only; the example can be generalized to distributions that, conditional on low e¤ort, are not functions of : F (sj0) = (s).
Assume two possible informativeness levels: L and H . Under high informativeness,
s is uniformly distributed in [0; 2]:

of the option-when-working and option-when-shirking are equal for X = 2e .
Claim 3 For symmetric distributions with unbounded support parameterized by e and
such F (sje) = G s e , the vegas of the option-when working and the option-whenshirking are equal for X = 2e .
Proof. We rely on (70) and use the fact that, for a distribution with unbounded
support, s = 1.
12

With high e¤ort, e = e, so the option-when-working is ATM for X = e. With low e¤ort, e = 0,
so the option-when-shirking is ATM for X = 0.

At-The-Money Options

This Appendix shows that the model’s main results continue to hold when the principal
is restricted to granting ATM options.
We consider the same problem described in Section 3.1, except that we assume that
the contract takes the form of ATM options. Considering ATM options requires that
we complement the model by deriving the t = 0 stock price. To simplify the exposition,
we assume that the …rm has a single share outstanding. Denoting the stock price at
time 0 by S0 , we have S0 = E[q] given the assumptions of a zero discount rate and risk
neutrality. In addition, with a symmetric distribution with location parameter e, we
have S0 = e.
Since the strike price is …xed (at the stock price), the number n
1 of ATM
13
options granted adjusts to satisfy the incentive constraint. It follows that e = e in
equilibrium, and S0 = e. With ATM options, the exercise price is therefore X = e.
Considering the same distributions as in section 3.3, we have the following results:

We only consider the cases such that there exists an incentive compatible contract with ATM

ATM options, i.e., with X = e. We conclude that the numerator of the fraction on the
RHS of (74) is strictly positive with ATM options.
Second, for an agent who receives n ATM options, the denominator of the fraction
on the RHS of (74) is equal to

with ATM options.
If informativeness is improved (i.e. falls), n must increase to maintain incentive
compatibility. This is because X = e > 2e with ATM options: the exercise price
is higher than the threshold 2e , so that an increase in informativeness reduces e¤ort
incentives, ceteris paribus (the intuition is the same as in Section 3.3). Incentive
compatibility then requires that the agent be given additional options.
Corollary 4 is the analogy of Corollary 1 in the main paper and compares the partial
and total e¤ects of changes in informativeness on the expected wage.

Corollary 4 then follows from this inequality and Lemma 7.
With ATM options, the total change in expected pay that follows a change in informativeness is smaller than the partial change: while an improvement in informativeness
lowers the value of the agent’s options, it also requires that the agent receives more
options for incentive compatibility. This incentive e¤ect partially o¤sets the bene…ts
to the principal.

Continuous E¤ort Model

In this section, we sketch a continuous e¤ort analog of the core model. The model
remains the same, except for the following assumptions:
(A1) The agent chooses e¤ort in e 2 [0; 1).
57

(A2) The agent’s objective function is E[W (s)je] c (e), with c > 0, > 0; 0 >
0; 00 > 0.
n
o
fe (sje)
d
(A3) MLRP: ds
> 0, where f ( je) denotes the PDF of s conditional on e,
f (sje)
and fe ( je) denotes its …rst derivative with respect to e.
(A4) E[maxfs X ; 0gje] c (e) is concave in e, and W (s) is piecewise smooth with
a right derivative, which guarantees that the …rst-order approach to the e¤ort choice
problem applies (see footnote 12 in Innes (1990)).
As in the core model, the principal induces a given level of e¤ort e > 0. As in
Proposition 3, we consider continuously distributed symmetric and regular distributions
with a location parameter, denoted by e. This implies that we can write s = e + ",
where E ["je] = 0.
For a given informativeness parameter , the principal’s problem is to choose a cadlag function W ( ) to minimize E[W (s)je] subject to the same constraints on contracting
as in the core model and the following incentive constraint:

W (s)f (sje)ds = c 0 (e):

Then applying Proposition 1 in Innes (1990) implies that, for a given , the optimal
contract is characterized by
W (s) = max f0; s

X g:

(78)

As in the core model, there is a unique X that satis…es the incentive constraint in (77)
with equality. Subsequent calculations require that the W (s) function be of class C 2
on the whole domain. This can be achieved by an arbitrarily small change in W (s) on
(X
u; X + u), where u ! 0, which smooths out the kink at X (Zang (1980)) while
leaving expected pay conditional on any e approximately unchanged.
Denoting by and the PDF and CDF of the distribution of ", respectively, the
incentive constraint in (77) can be rewritten as

For a given exercise price, an improvement in informativeness reduces the LHS of

The …rst term is equal to zero since ( 1) = ( 1) = 0 and (1) = (1) = 1. In
addition, W 00 (s) > 0 on (X
u; X + u), and is equal to zero elsewhere. Since u ! 0
and is continuous, it follows that (81) is satis…ed if and only if (X e) > (X e).
In turn, because of single crossing of the CDFs at zero and the symmetry of , this is
satis…ed if and only if X > e.
As in the baseline model, the LHS of the incentive constraint is strictly decreasing in
X. Therefore, for the incentive constraint to still be satis…ed following an improvement
in informativeness (i.e., a higher ), we have
