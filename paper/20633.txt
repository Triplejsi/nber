Social Insurance, Information Revelation, and Lack of Commitment
Mikhail Golosov and Luigi Iovino
NBER Working Paper No. 20633
October 2014
JEL No. D82,D86,E61,H3
ABSTRACT
We study the optimal provision of insurance against unobservable idiosyncratic shocks in a setting
in which a benevolent government cannot commit. A continuum of agents and the government play
an infinitely repeated game. Actions of the government are constrained only by the threat of reverting
to the worst perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE). We construct a recursive problem that characterizes
the resource allocation and information revelation on the Pareto frontier of the set of PBE. We prove
a version of the Revelation Principle and find an upper bound on the maximum number of messages
that are needed to achieve the optimal allocation. Agents play mixed strategies over that message set
to limit the amount of information transmitted to the government. The central feature of the optimal
contract is that agents who enter the period with low implicitly-promised lifetime utilities reveal no
information to the government and receive no insurance against current period shock, while agents
with high promised utilities reveal precise information about their current shock and receive insurance
as in economies with full commitment by the government.

Introduction

The major insight of the normative public …nance literature is that there are substantial bene…ts
from using past and present information about individuals to provide them with insurance
against shocks and incentives to work. A common assumption of the normative literature is
that the government is a benevolent social planner with perfect ability to commit. The more
information such a planner has, the more e¢ ciently she can allocate resources.1
The political economy literature has long emphasized that such commitment may be dif…cult to achieve in practice.2 Self-interested politicians and voters –whom we would broadly
refer to as “the government” –are tempted to re-optimize over time and choose new policies.
When the government cannot commit, the bene…ts of providing more information to the government are less clear. Better informed governments may allocate resources more e¢ ciently
as in the conventional normative analysis but may also be more tempted to depart from the
ex-ante desirable policies. The analysis of such environments is di¢ cult because the main
analytical tool to study private information economies –the Revelation Principle –fails when
the decision maker cannot commit.
In this paper we study optimal information revelation and resource allocation in a simple
model of social insurance – the unobservable taste shock environment of Atkeson and Lucas
(1992). This environment, together with closely related models of Green (1987), Thomas and
Worrall (1990), Phelan and Townsend (1991), provides theoretical foundation for a lot of recent
work in macro and public …nance. This set up and its extensions was used to study design of
unemployment and disability insurance (Hopenhayn and Nicolini (1997), Golosov and Tsyvinski (2006)), life cycle taxation (Farhi and Werning (2013), Golosov, Troshkin and Tsyvinski
(2011)), human capital policies (Stantcheva (2014)), …rm dynamics (Clementi and Hopenhayn
(2006)), military con‡ict (Yared (2010)), international borrowing and lending (Dovis (2009)).
In the key departure from that literature we assume that resources are allocated by the government, which, although benevolent, lacks commitment. We study how information revelation
a¤ects incentives of the government to provide insurance in such settings and characterize the

The seminal work of Mirrlees (1971) started a large literature in public …nance on taxation, redistribution and
social insurance in presence of private information about individuals’types. Well known work of Akerlof (1978)
on “tagging” is another early example of how a benevolent government can use information about individuals
to impove e¢ ciency. For the surveys of the recent literature on social insurance and private informaiton see
Golosov, Tsyvinski and Werning (2006) and Kocherlakota (2010).

There is a vast literature in political economy that studies frictions that policymakers face. For our purposes,
work of Acemoglu (2003) and Besley and Coate (1998) is particularly relevant who argue that ine¢ ciencies in
a large class of politico-economic models can be traced back to the lack of commitment. Kydland and Prescott
(1977) is the seminal contribution that was the …rst to analyze policy choices when the policymaker cannot
commit.

1

properties of the optimal contract.
Formally, we study a repeated game between the government and a continuum of atomless
citizens in the spirit of Chari and Kehoe (1990) and focus on the perfect Bayesian equilibria
(PBE) that are not Pareto-dominated by other PBE. The economy is endowed with a constant
amount of perishable good in each period and the government allocates that endowment among
agents. Agents receive privately observable taste shocks that follow a Markov process, which
is assumed to be iid in the baseline version of our model. Agents transmit information about
their shocks to the government by sending messages. The government uses these messages
to form posterior beliefs about realization of agents’types and allocate resources. The main
friction is that ex-post, upon learning information about the agent’s type, the government
has the temptation to allocate resources di¤erently from what is required ex-ante to provide
incentives to reveal information. The more precise information the government has about the
agents’types, the higher its payo¤ from deviation is.
Our paper makes three contributions. First, we construct a recursive formulation of our
problem. The key di¢ culty that we need to overcome is that the value of the worst equilibrium
depends on the implicit promises made to all agents. The standard recursive techniques,
that characterize optimal insurance for each history of past shocks in isolation from other
histories, do not apply directly since information that any agent reveals a¤ects the government’s
incentives to renege on the promises made to other agents. We make progress by showing how
to construct an upper bound for the value of deviation which coincides with that value if
all agents play the best PBE and takes weakly higher value for any other strategy. This
upper bound can be represented as a history-by-history integral of functions that depends only
on the current reporting strategy of a given agent, and thus can be represented recursively.
Since the original best PBE strategies still satisfy all the constraints of this modi…ed, tighter
problem, the solution to this recursive problem allows us to uncover the best PBE. The resulting
recursive problem is very simple. It is essentially a standard problem familiar from the recursive
contract literature with two modi…cations: agents are allowed to choose mixed rather than
pure strategies over their reports and there is an extra term in planner’s objective function
that captures "temptation" costs of revealing more information.
Our second contribution is to show a version of the Revelation Principle for our settings. It
is well known that standard direct revelation mechanisms, in which agents report their types
truthfully to the government, are not e¢ cient in this type of settings. Bester and Strausz
(2001) showed that, in a repeated game between one principle and one agent whose type can
take N values, the message space can be restricted to only N messages over which agents play

2

mixed reporting strategies. These techniques do not apply to economies with more than one
agent.3 We show that in our baseline version of the model with continuum of agents and iid
shocks it is without loss of generality to restrict attention to message spaces with at most 2N 1
messages. This result follows from the fact that with iid shocks our recursive characterization
satis…es single-crossing property, and therefore all messages that give any type n the highest
utility can be partitioned in three regions: those that also give the highest utility to types
n + 1 and n
2N

1 and those that give the highest utility to only type n: There can be at most

1 of such partitions and convexity of our problem implies that it is su¢ cient to have one

message per each partition.
Our third contribution is the characterization of the properties of the optimal contract and
the e¢ cient information revelation. As in the full commitment case of Atkeson and Lucas
(1992), it is optimal to allocate resources to agents with temporality high taste shocks by
implicitly promising to increase future lifetime utility of agents with temporarily low taste
shocks. As agents experience di¤erent histories of shocks, there is a distribution of promised
utilities at any given time. We show that it is e¢ cient for agents who enter the period with
di¤erent promised utilities to reveal di¤erent amounts of information. In particular, we show
that under quite general conditions agents who enter the period with low promised utilities
reveal no information about their idiosyncratic shock in that period and receive no insurance.
In contrast, under some additional assumption on the utility function and the distribution of
shocks, agents who enter the period with high promised utilities reveal their private information
fully to the government. The optimal insurance contract for such agents closely resembles the
contract when the government can commit.
The intuition for this result can be seen from comparing costs and bene…ts of revealing
information to the government. The costs are driven by the temptation to deviate from the exante optimal plan and re-optimize. When the government deviates from the best equilibrium,
it reneges on all the past implicit promises and allocates consumption to each agent based on
its posterior beliefs about agent’s current type. Therefore, the incentives for the government
to deviate depend only on the total amount information it has but not on which agents reveal
it. On the contrary, the bene…ts of information revelation depend on the e¢ ciency gains from
better information on the equilibrium path, which in turn depend on the implicit promises
with which an agent enters the period. The general lesson is that the agents for whom better

mechanism in a game between one buyer and one seller. Bester and Strausz (2000) provide an example of an
economy with two agents to illustrate that that with more than one agent message spaces with only N elements
are restrictive.

information leads to the highest e¢ ciency gains on the equilibrium path should send precise
signals to the government. In Atkeson and Lucas (1992) multiplicative taste shock environment
those are the agents with high promised utility.
Participation constraints of the government prevent the emergence of the extreme inequality, known as immiseration, which is a common feature of environments with commitment. The
optimal contract exhibits mean reversion, so that agents with low current promised utilities
receive in expectation higher future promises, and vice versa. This implies that in an invariant
distribution no agent is stuck in the no-insurance region forever, and in a …nite number of steps
he reaches a point when he reveals some information about his shock and some insurance is
provided. Thus, we show that in the invariant distribution there is generally an endogenous
lower bound below which agent’s promised utility never falls.
Our paper is related to a relatively small literature on mechanism design without commitment. Roberts (1984) was one of the …rst to explore the implications of lack of commitment for
social insurance. He studied a dynamic economy in which types are private information but
do not change over time. More recently, Sleet and Yeltekin (2006), Sleet and Yeltekin (2008),
Acemoglu, Golosov and Tsyvinski (2010), Farhi et al. (2012) all studied versions of dynamic
economies with idiosyncratic shocks closely related to our economy but made various assumptions on commitment technology and shock processes to ensure that any information becomes
obsolete once the government deviates. In contrast, the focus of our paper is on understanding
incentives to reveal information and their interaction with the incentives of the government.
Our paper is also related to the literature on the ratchet e¤ect, e.g. Freixas, Guesnerie and
Tirole (1985), La¤ont and Tirole (1988). These authors pointed out that without commitment
it is di¢ cult to establish which incentive constraints bind, which signi…cantly inhibited further
development of this literature. Some papers have thus focused on the analysis of suboptimal
but tractable incentive schemes. We show that the problem substantially simpli…es when the
principal interacts with a continuum of agents since any agent’s report does not a¤ect the
aggregate distribution of the signals received by the principal. In this case we can obtain a
tight characterization of the optimal information revelation for high and low values of promised
utilities.
Our results about e¢ cient information revelation are also related to the insights on optimal
monitoring in Aiyagari and Alvarez (1995). In their paper the government has commitment but
can also use a costly monitoring technology to verify the agents’reports. They characterize how
monitoring probabilities depend on the agents’promised values. Although our environment and
theirs are very di¤erent in many respects, we both share the same insight that more information

4

should be revealed by those agents for whom e¢ ciency gains from better information are the
highest. Work of Bisin and Rampini (2006) pointed out that in general it might be desirable
to hide information from a benevolent government in a two period economy. Finally, our
recursive formulation builds on the literature on recursive contracts with private information
and a patient social planner. Work of Farhi and Werning (2007) provides recursive tools that
are particularly useful in our settings.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our baseline environment
with iid shocks. Section 3 derives the recursive characterization and shows a version of the
Revelation Principle. Section 4 analyzes e¢ cient information revelation and optimal insurance.
Section 5 extends our analysis to general Markov shocks.

The model

The economy is populated by a continuum of agents of total measure 1 and the government. There is an in…nite number of periods, t = 0; 1; 2; ::: The economy is endowed with
e units of a perishable good in each period. Agent’s instantaneous utility from consuming
ct units of the good in period t is given by

tU

(ct ) where U : R+ ! R is an increas-

ing, strictly concave, continuously di¤erentiable function. The utility function U satis…es
Inada conditions limc!0 U 0 (c) = 1 and limc!1 U 0 (c) = 0 and it may be bounded or un-

bounded. All agents have a common discount factor

2.1

The game between the government and agents

The physical structure of our environment corresponds exactly to the model of Atkeson and
Lucas (1992). The constrained e¢ cient allocations that they characterize can be achieved by
the government which is able to commit in period 0 to in…nite period contracts. We focus
on the environment without commitment. We model the interaction between the government
and individuals along the lines of the literature on sustainable plans (Chari and Kehoe (1990),
Chari and Kehoe (1993)). Before formally de…ning the game we brie‡y outline its structure.
The government does not observes agents’types, so it collects information by having the agents
submit messages. More speci…cally, at the beginning of any period t the government chooses
a message set Mt from some space M: All agents observe their types and submits messages
mt 2 Mt . The government allocates consumption to agents as a function of current and past
reports.

To capture the main trade-o¤ in information revelation we assume that the government
cannot commit even within a period: it can pick any feasible allocation of resources after
collecting agents’reports. This allows for a simple and transparent analysis in our benchmark
case of iid shocks. As we discuss in Section 5, much of the analysis carries through to the case
when shocks are persistent.4
We now formally de…ne our game. We start with information sets. Let S t

A small recent literature on social insurance without commitment sidesteps the possibility that the government may misuse information when it deviates from equilibrium strategies. For example, Acemoglu, Golosov
and Tsyvinski (2010) allow agents to stop interacting with the government if it deviates, while Sleet and Yeltekin (2008), Farhi et al. (2012) assume that shocks are iid but there is commitment within the period. All
these environment are constructed so that the information about individuals becomes obsolete if the government
deviates.

The recursive problem and the Revelation principle

In this section we discuss two intermediate results that are necessary for our analysis of optimal
information revelation. First, we derive the recursive problem solution to which characterizes
the optimal reporting strategy and consumption allocation in best PBEs. Recursive techniques
are the standard tool to solve dynamic contracting problems, which essentially allow to solve
for optimal insurance after any given history of shocks separately from the other histories.
In our game-theoretic settings the standard approach to constructing Bellman equations is
not applicable: the government’s incentive to deviate from a best equilibrium depends on the
reporting strategies of all agents making the usual history-by-history separation of incentives is
impossible. To overcome this di¢ culty, we consider a constrained problem in which we replace
the function that characterizes the value of deviation for the government with another function
which is linear in the distribution of the past histories of reports. We show that this function
can be chosen such that a solution to the original problem is also a solution to the constrained
problem. The advantage is that the linearity of the constrained problem in the distribution
of past reports allows us to solve for the optimal contract recursively, history-by-history. The
key insight for this construction is that the Lagrange multiplier on resource constraint in the
best one shot deviation from best equilibrium strategies summarizes all relevant information.
The second result of this section characterizes the minimum dimension of the message space
M that is needed to support best PBEs. Reduction of an arbitrarily message space M to a
smaller dimension object is important for tractability of the maximization problem. This step
is similar in spirit to invoking the Revelation Principle in standard mechanism design problems
with commitment, and we refer to this result as the (generalized) Revelation principle.
Although these steps are crucial for our ultimate goal – characterization of e¢ cient information revelation – these tools are of interest in themselves. A lot of environments without
commitment share the feature that value of deviation for the “principal”depends on actions of
many agents, and the recursive techniques developed in our settings should also be applicable
to such environments. To the best of our knowledge, there is no version of the Revelation
Principle for economies with multiple agents when the principal lacks commitment. A well
known paper by Bester and Strausz (2001) developed a version the Revelation Principle for an
economy with one agent, but their approach and the main result do not extend to multi-agent
settings.

3.1

The recursive problem

We start by describing a PBE that delivers the lowest payo¤ to the government, to which we
refer as the worst PBE. It is easy to show that there are worst equilibria in which no information
is revealed.5 To see this, let m? (M ) be an arbitrary message from a set M 2 M. Consider a
w;

strategy pro…le (

w)
G

in which all agents report message m? (M ) with probability 1 for all

M , and the government allocates the same utility uw

Proof. The best response of the government to agents’reporting strategy

w

is to allocate

the same utility to all agents since its beliefs pw do not depend on m and C is strictly convex.
Given this allocation rule, playing

w

is optimal for agents, therefore (

that delivers the government payo¤ U (e) = (1

) : Strategy

is feasible for any reporting

strategy that agents choose, so the government can attain payo¤ U (e) = (1
which proves that (

w ; pw )
G

) in any PBE,

is a worst PBE for the government.

Standard arguments establish that best equilibria are supported to reverting to the worst
PBE following any deviation of the government from its equilibrium strategies. We split
our problem in two parts. First, we …x any sequence of message sets M and describe the
maximization problem that characterizes the best PBE given that sequence of message sets,
which we call the best equilibria given M: We then show that the same payo¤ can be achieved
with a much simpler message set that has only a …nite number of messages. That set is
independent of M and hence without loss of generality it can be chosen as the message set in
the best PBE.
We start with several preliminary observations that simplify the notation. Since there is no
aggregate uncertainty the aggregate distribution of reports and allocations is a deterministic
sequence. Therefore, it is redundant to keep track of the aggregate history S t in best equilibria
and we drop this explicit dependence from our notation. Moreover, without loss of generality
we can restrict attention to reporting strategies
on the past history of shocks
since as long as

5
In fact, a stronger statement is true that in any worst equilibrium no information is revealed. This statement
follows from our Lemma 2.
6
In the Supplementary Material we show that for any PBE ( 0 ; 0G ; p0 ) there is another PBE ( ; G ; p) which
delivers the same payo¤ to all agents and the government as ( 0 ; 0G ; p0 ) (i.e. ( ; G ; p) is payo¤ -equivalent to
( 0 ; 0G ; p0 )) and has the property that t does not depend on t 1 :

ht ;

t

can replicate each other strategies for all past

t 1

: This implies that all information

about agents at the beginning of period t can be summarized by the distribution of reports
t 1:

We now turn to setting up the maximization problem that characterizes best equilibria
given M: Since any deviation by the government from a best equilibrium triggers a switch to
the worst PBE, it is su¢ cient to consider only the best one-shot deviation from equilibrium
strategies by the government. The government that observes the distribution of personal

The main di¢ culty in the analysis of problem (9) is that the sustainability constraint (10)

depends on W

Before formally proving this result, it is useful to introduce some de…nitions. We say that

( ) = 1 a.s., i.e. for almost every
message m with respect to the measure generated by

reveal no additional information other than the unconditional expectation of : All other

interpret ^ as the e¤ective discount factor of the government in the best equilibrium. It is

greater than agents’discount factor

because the government also needs to take into account

how its actions a¤ects the sustainability constraints in the future. This is a general result
about the role of the lack of commitment on discounting that was highlighted, for example, by
Sleet and Yeltekin (2008) and Farhi et al. (2012).
The maximization problem (17) shows costs and bene…ts of information revelation. The
more information the agents reveal, the easier it is for the planner to maximize the costweighted utility function of the agents,

t ut

tC

(ut ) : At the same time, better information

also increases the temptation to deviate, captured by the term

t Wt :

This trade-o¤ is at the

heart of our characterization in Section 4.
We make two assumptions on the properties of these Lagrange multipliers which we maintain throughout the analysis, lim sup

t

> 0 and lim inf

t

> 0: These conditions simplify

technical arguments and in the Supplementary material we provide su¢ cient conditions for
C that ensure that these assumptions are satis…ed. Since the Langrange multipliers should
satisfy these properties much more generally – for example whenever the economy converges
to an invariant distribution and the long-run immiseration is a feature of the optimal contract
with full commitment –we opted to make assumptions on the multipliers directly.8
An important simplifying feature of the modi…ed maximization problem and the Lagrangian
(17) is that the distribution of past reports

t 1

enters the objective function and the con-

straints linearly. This allows us to solve for the optimal allocations and reporting strategies
separately for each history ht

1:

We do so by extending the recursive techniques developed by

Farhi and Werning (2007) who study an economy with commitment but in which the principal
is more patient than agents.
7
This representation is possible since allowing the government and agents to condition their strategies on
z convexi…es the maximization problem (9). The formal arguments are straightforward but cumbersome, we
present their sketch in the Supplementary Material.
8
Immiseration is a common feature of long-term contracts with commitment. See Ljunqvist and Sargent
(2004) for a textbook discussion and Phelan (2006) and Hosseini, Jones and Shourideh (2013) for recent contributions to the literature. We discuss existence of the invariant distribution in Section 5.1.

Most of the proof of this proposition follows the arguments of Farhi and Werning (2007) and
is provided in the Supplementary materials. The solution to this Bellman equation is attained
by some function gtu (v; ; z) ; gtw (v; ; z) and gt (v; ; z) : We can use these policy functions to

Standard arguments establish when these (u; ) are a solution

3.2

The Revelation Principle

The recursive problem (20) is similar to the usual recursive dynamic contract formulation
with commitment with two modi…cations. First, agents play a mixed reporting strategy over
set M rather than a pure reporting strategy over set
t Wt

: Second, there is an additional term

that captures the cost of information revelation. In this section we further simplify

the problem by showing that incentive constraints (22) impose a lot of structure on agents’
reporting strategies and simplify the message space that needs to be considered in best PBEs.
Since incentive constraints (22) hold for each z; we drop in this section the explicit dependence of strategies on the payo¤ irrelevant variable, and our arguments should be understood to
apply for any z: Let fu (m) ; w (m)gm2Mt be any allocation that satis…es (22). Let Mt ( )
be the subset of messages that give type

the highest utility, i.e.

u m0 + w m0

u (m) + w (m)

for all m 2 Mt ( ) ; m0 2 Mt :

Sum this inequality with an analogous condition for type
0

0

u (m)

u m0

Mt

0

to get

for all ; 0 ; m 2 Mt ( ) ; m0 2 Mt

0

:

(24)

One immediate implication of this equation is that any incentive compatible allocation is
monotone in types, i.e.

>

0

implies u (m)

u (m0 ) and w (m)

w (m0 ) : It follows that

each message set Mt ( i ) can be partitioned into three regions: the messages that also belong
to Mt (

i+1 ) ;

the messages that also belong to Mt (

i 1 ),

and the messages that do not belong

to any other Mt ( j ) :
The next proposition shows that it is without loss of generality to assume that agents send
only one message per each partition. Since there can be at most 2j j

1 of such partitions, it

also gives an upper bound on the cardinality of the message space needed in best PBEs.
Proposition 3 Any best PBE is payo¤ equivalent to a PBE in which agents report no more
than 2j j

1 messages after any history ht : Furthermore such PBE can be constructed so that

if m0 6= m00 then the utility allocation in equilibrium, ut , satis…es ut ht ; m 6= ut ht ; m
^ :
We brie‡y sketch the key steps of the arguments. Consider any partition Mt ( i )\Mt (

i+1 ) :

Equation (24) implies that (u (m) ; w (m)) must be the same for all m 2 Mt ( i ) \ Mt (

i+1 ) :

Therefore, all reporting strategies

that keep the same probability of reporting messages m 2
=

Mt ( i )\Mt ( i+1 ) have the same on-the-equilibrium-path payo¤ E

C

t+1 t+1

Thus, in a best BPE the reporting of messages in Mt ( i ) \ Mt (

i+1 )

must minimize the o¤-

the-equilibrium-path payo¤ E [ t Wt ]. Convexity of Wt implies that such reporting strategy
15

keeps posterior beliefs of the government the same for all m 2 Mt ( i ) \ Mt (

without loss of generality to allow only one message for each Mt ( i ) \ Mt (

i+1 ) :

Then it is

i+1 ) :

The reverse arguments allow to reach the same conclusion for the subset of Mt ( i ) that does

not intersect with any other Mt ( j ) ; which we denote Mtexcl ( i ) : Conditional of observing any
message sent with a positive probability from subset Mtexcl ( i ) ; the government learns that the
sender is type

i

with certainty. Therefore the o¤-the-equilibrium-path payo¤ does not depend

on the exact probability with each type

i

reports messages in Mtexcl ( i ) : Strict convexity of the

on-the-equilibrium-path payo¤ implies that the government chooses that same (u (m) ; w (m))
for all m 2 Mtexcl ( i ), which again implies that it is without loss of generality to restrict

attention to only one message.

Proposition 3 is very useful for the characterization of the optimal incentive provision and
information revelation in the next section. It also allows us to prove a version of the Revelation
Principle in our economy. Let M be any set of cardinality j j:
Corollary 1 Any best PBE given M is payo¤ equivalent to a best PBE given Mt = M
for all t: The incentive constraint (22) for such equilibrium can be written, for each z; as
(m2i

1 j 2i 1 )

> 0 and
i u (m2i 1 )

(mj i ) [( i u (m2i

+ w (m2i

+ w (m2i

1 ))

1)

i u (m)

+ w (m) ;

(25)

( i u (m) + w (m))] = 0 for all i = 1; ::; j j; m 2 M :

This result shows that in general the dimensionality of message space with a continuum of
agents is …nite but bigger than the dimensionality of the message space with only one agent.
In the latter case Bester and Strausz (2001) showed that without loss of generality one can
restrict attention to a message space M =

: Their result does not extend to economies with

multiple agents.10 Corollary 1 shows that even with a continuum of agents the dimensionality
of the message space remains small.

Characterization

In this section we characterize properties of the e¢ cient information revelation. We start with a
simpli…ed environment that illustrates the main trade-o¤s very transparently. We then extend
the insights developed by this example to our general settings.
10

See Bester and Strausz (2000) for a counterexample with two agents.

4.1

A simpli…ed environment

We make two simplifying assumptions in this section. First, we assume that the government
can deviate from its implicit promises in period t only if it deviates in period 0. This simpli…es
the analysis of the best equilibrium as it is su¢ cient to ensure that government’s sustainability
constraint (10) holds only in period 0. This case is isomorphic to our Lagrangian formulation
with

t

= 0 for all t > 0: Secondly, we assume that agents’preferences can be represented by

a utility function U (c) = ac1=a when 1=a < 1; with U (c) = ln c when 1=a = 0:
Under the …rst simplifying assumption the Lagrangian (17) can be written, up to a constant,
as

subject to (11) and (12). First, consider the sub-game starting from t = 1: Since the sustainability constraints do not bind for all t

1; the standard Revelation principle applies and the

maximization problem that characterizes the optimal allocations is identical to that in Atkeson
and Lucas (1992). It is easy to show that the value function with CRRA preferences takes the
form

1 (v)

With public randomization the maximum is taken over the convex hull of the function on the
right hand side.
Consider …rst the case when j j = 2 and agents can only play two reporting strategies:

a full information revelation strategy

when each type reports a distinct message with

probability 1, and a no information revelation strategy

when each type randomizes between

all messages with the same probability. Since the former strategy has higher payo¤ both onand o¤- the equilibrium path, d

for all v < v2 and lower value for all v > v2 :

Allowing public randomization may further increase the government’s payo¤ and create an
intermediate region (region (v1 ; v3 ) on the graph) in which the reporing strategy is stochastic
but it does not alter the main conclusion: no information revelation is optimal for low values
of v and full information is optimal for high values of v.
To understand the intution for this result, it is useful to compare the on the equilibium
path bene…ts of information revelation,

Given our CRRA assumption, it is easy to see that the bene…ts

are monotonically increasing in v; equal to zero as v ! v and to in…nity as v ! v: The o¤ the

equilibrium path costs of information revelation do not depend on v: Therefore, there must
exist a region of low enough v where the costs of better information revelation exceed the
bene…ts and a region of high enough v where the opposite conclusion holds.
This conclusion does not depend on the fact that we restricted attention to only two
reporting strategies. When j j = 2; any

and therefore no information revelation

is optimal for low enough v. However, full information revelation no longer gives strictly higher
value than any other reporting strategy on the equilibrium path. The reason for it is that
bunching might be optimal even in standard mechanism design problems with commitment.
Our result for high values of v extends if the distribution of types is such that no bunching
is desirable with commitment (equation (33) provides a su¢ cient condition for that). More
18

generally, it can be shown that some information revelation is desirable for high v, in particular
it is optimal for

1

to reveal his type perfectly.

Finally, we comment on the role of the assumption of constant relative risk aversion. Our
arguments for no information revelation for low values of v only used the fact that

un

provides

the lowest value to the government o¤ the equilibrium path. This is true for any preferences.
The arguments for e¢ ciency of full information revelation rely on the fact that
0 (v;

0

v;

in

) becomes unboundedly large for high values of v: A su¢ cient condition for this is that

the absolute risk aversion goes to zero as consumption goes to in…nity, and our conclusion
holds for all preferences satisfying this condition.
This example illustrates the general principle that goes beyond the particular taste-shock
model that we consider in this paper. Since the o¤ the equilibrium path costs of information
revelation do not depend on past promises (the principal simply reneges on them when deviates)
but the bene…ts do, it is optimal to reveal less information for those agents for whom the on
the equilibrium gains are lowest. The gains from better information are monotone in v in the
taste shock economy that we consider in this paper; which allows us to get sharp cut-o¤s, but
the general principle holds regardless of this property.

4.2

Characterization of the general case

In this section we study e¢ cient information revelation in our baseline model of Section 3. Let
(uv ; wv ;

v)

be a solution to (20). To streamline the exposition, in the body of the paper we

focus on interior optimum when the lower bound U (0) does not bind; many arguments are
simpler if the lower bound binds.
We start with two key optimality conditions. The …rst order conditions for uv and wv can
be re-arranged as
^

t+1

E

v

0
kt+1
(wv ) jz = kt0 (v)

(26)

C 0 (uv ) jz :

(27)

and
kt0 (v) = 1

tE

v

The …rst condition describes the law of motion for promised utilities. Since ^ t+1

with strict

inequality when the sustainability constraint binds in period t + 1; it shows a version of meanreversion in promised utilities. Since kt and kt+1 are concave functions with interior maxima,
it implies that period t + 1 promises have a drift towards the value that maximizes kt+1 : This
drift component implies higher future promises for low-v agents and lower promises for high-v
agents. This mean-reverting drift helps the government to relax sustainability constraints in

19

future periods. The second condition provides a linkage between promised and current utility
allocations.
For our purposes it is important to establish bounds for uv and wv : The optimality conditions (see Appendix for details) imply that

Equation (28) shows the role of private information. If agents’ types were observable,

the planner would equalize the marginal costs of providing 1 util to type , 1

tC

0 (u) ;

to the shadow cost of past promises, kt0 (v) ; while allocating the same promised utility w
to all types. This would give more consumption to higher

types, which is not incentive

compatible. With private information the dispersion of current period consumption allocations
is smaller, which can be seen by the bounds (28). Equation (29) shows, in addition, how the
sustainability constraints in future periods interact with the provision of incentives in the
current period. It shows that bounds for future promises 1

0
kt+1
(wv ) shrink as v ! v:

When future sustainability constraints bind, the government realizes that more dispersion of
inequality tomorrow makes it harder to sustain e¢ cient outcomes, which limits the dispersion
of promises that the government gives and prevents the long run immiseration.
Conditions similar to (26)-(29) also appear in the problems in which the government can
fully commit (see Atkeson and Lucas (1992) and Farhi and Werning (2007)). Our analysis
generalizes those conditions to the environments with no commitment. A novel feature of such
environments is that complete information revelation is generally suboptimal. We next turn
to the characterization of the e¢ cient information revelation.

Equation (30) captures bene…ts and costs of information revelation. The left hand side of
the equation captures the bene…ts of better information revelation on the equilibrium path.
It compares the “cost-weighted” utility that the government obtains for type
messages m0 and m00 : This term is the general form of the expression

0

v;

if it receives

in

0 (v;

un )

that appeared in our simpli…ed example in Section 4.1. The right hand side of the equation
captures the cost of information revelation o¤ the equilibrium path. If message m00 reveals
more information about
further from

than m0 ; in a sense that the expectation of

conditional on m00 is

than the expectation conditional on m0 ; this expression is positive. The right

hand side of (30) is the analogue of

0

W0

in

W0 (

un )

in Section 4.1.

Equation (30) develops the key intuition for e¢ cient information revelation. First, consider
information revelation for low values of v: Bounds (28) and (29) imply the expression on the
left hand side of (30) converges to zero as v ! v; so that the gains from information revelation

disappear for low values of v. Therefore, the optimal reporting strategy must converge to
a strategy that minimizes the o¤ the equilibrium path cost of information revelation. Such
strategy must be uninformative by Lemma 2. Note that the uninformative strategy assigns
the same posterior belief for any reported message, so that that right hand side of (30) is zero.
In the Appendix we prove a stronger result that the uninformative strategy is optimal for all
v su¢ ciently low.
Theorem 1 Suppose that the sustainability constraint (10) binds in periods t and t + 1: There

exists vt > v such that for all v 2 v; vt
strategy

v

the allocation (uv ; wv ;

v)

does not depend on z;

is uninformative and (uv (m) ; wv (m)) = (uv (m0 ) ; wv (m0 )) for all m; m0 :

We now turn to the analysis of information revelation for high values of v: Consider the
case when j j = 2: By Proposition 3 we can restrict attention to at most 3 messages, such that

reporting two of those messages reveals the type of the sender perfectly. Therefore the left
hand side of (30) compares on-the-equilibrium-path bene…ts from a message that reveals full
information about a sender and a message that reveals only some of the information. Bounds
(28) and (29) can be used to show that as long as the coe¢ cient of absolute risk aversion,
U 00 (c)=U 0 (c) goes to zero for high c; the informational gains from better information must go
to in…nity as v ! v: Since the informational costs are bounded by Lemma 2, this implies that
equation (30) cannot hold and each agent must reveal his type fully for all v high enough.
Formally, suppose that utility satis…es
Assumption 1 (decreasing absolute risk aversion) U is twice continuously di¤ erentiable

21

and
lim U 00 (c) =U (c) = 0:

(31)

We say that

Theorem 2 Suppose that Assumption 1 is satis…ed and j j = 2: Then there exists vt+ < v

such that for all v

v

reveals full information about each type.

Previous arguments can also be extended for the …rst and the last type of arbitrary message
spaces.
Corollary 2 Suppose that Assumption 1 is satis…ed.
1. (no informational distortions at the top). Then

reveals full information about

The …rst part of this Corollary shows that full information for the lowest type

1

is optimal

for high v: It is an informational analogue of the “no distortion at the top” result from the
mechanism design literature (see, e.g. Mirrlees (1971)). In the mechanism design version of
our environment, the incentive constraints bind upward, so that
that no other type wants to pretend to be

1:

1

is the “top type”in a sense

This property of the top types drives both the

“no distortion at the top” result in standard mechanism design models with commitment and
part 1 of Corollary 2 in our environment.
Part 2 of Corollary 2 shows that informational distortions are suboptimal for the highest
j j

as long as the types are not too close to each other. The extra condition is needed to

rule out bunching. When some types are close, it might be optimal to give them the same
allocations even if they reveal their type fully (as, for example, in models with commitment)
in order to provide incentives for other types. Since bunching is suboptimal with two types,
no additional conditions were necessary in Theorem 2.
More insight into the behavior of the interior types can be gained from assuming that the
utility function satis…es U (c) = ac1=a for a > 1: In this case it is easy to …nd the limiting
allocations towards (uv ; wv ;

v)

converge as v ! v: In particular, we can use homogeneity of
22

C and boundedness from below of u to show that for any v; kt (v0 v) =v a ! k~t (v) as v0 ! v;
where function k~t (v) is de…ned by

( j )2 (M )

subject to (22) and (21). Moreover,

v

converges to a solution ~ of this problem.

The limiting problem (32) has no cost of information revelation. It is equivalent to a
standard mechanism design problem in which agents can send reports over a redundantly large
message set M : If it is suboptimal to bunch di¤erent types when agents report over

, it

is also suboptimal to bunch types when agents report over M : A su¢ cient condition to rule
out bunching in mechanism design problems is an assumption that types are not too close,
which we state as Assumption 2. It turns out to be a su¢ cient condition for full information
revelation for high enough v in our economy without commitment.

Note that this assumption is satis…ed both in Theorem 1 and Corollary 2. Suboptimality of
bunching in the limit implies that information revelation is suboptimal for all su¢ ciently high
v: The proof of this result is a tedious but mostly straightforward application of the Theorem
of Maximum and we leave it for the Supplementary material.
Proposition 4 Suppose that U (c) = ac1=a for a > 1 and Assumption 2 is satis…ed. Then
there exists vt+ < v such that for all v

Extensions

We discussion two extensions of the baseline analysis.

5.1

Invariant distribution

In the previous sections we used arbitrary distributions of initial lifetime utilities

: In this

section we brie‡y discuss two implications for our analysis if
is an invariant distribution.
In this case multipliers ^ ; and do not depend on t, with ^ > ; > 0 needed to prevent
immiseration.12
For given ^ ; ; one can follow the arguments of Farhi and Werning (2007) to show that there exists initial
distibution ~ with a property that t generated by a solution to (20) is such that t = ~ for all t: This
distribution is invariant if feasibility and sustainabilty constraints hold with equalities. We leave it for future
research to explore under which conditions these constraints are satis…ed.
12

23

One implication of the invariant distribution is that no agent is stuck forever in the region
in which no information is revealed. To see this, note that equation (29) shows that agent’s
promised utility strictly increases with positive probability if vt < v and strictly decreases with
positive probability if vt > v ; where v is given by k 0 (v ) = 0: Suppose there is no information
revelation for all v

v + a where a

0: Then the invariant distribution must assign all

the mass to v and, moreover, no information about agents is revealed. But in this case the
sustainability constraint is slack, which is a contradiction. Therefore the “no information”
region lies strictly below v .
Another implication of Theorem 1 and bounds (29) in this case is that there must exists
an endogenous lower bound beyond which agents’lifetime utility never falls. Once an agent’s
utility reaches that bound, he bounces from it with a positive probability. This dynamics
resembles that of Atkeson and Lucas (1995), except that in their case the utility bound was set
exogenously. Near the endogenous lower bound agent may reveal no information and receive
no insurance against that period’s shocks.

5.2

Persistent shocks

We chose to focus on iid shocks in our benchmark analysis. Most of our key results extend
with few modi…cations to Markov shocks. When the shocks are Markov, let
the probability of realization of shock
assume that

j

conditional on shock

> 0 for all ;

conditional on shock
t

: Let

j

j

denote

in the previous period. We

be the probability of realization of

being realized t periods ago.

Many arguments in the persistent case are straightforward extentions of our previous analysis. We brie‡y sketch them in this section leaving the details for the Supplementary material.
Following the same steps as before, we can show that in the worst equilibrium there is no
information revelation for the government. The payo¤ in that equilibrium, unlike the iid case,
depends on the prior beliefs that the government has. The maximum payo¤ that the government can achieve in any period t is given by

then Lemma 2, and in particular bound (14), can be extended to Wt ( t ; pt ) : It is straightforward then to obtain the analogue of Lagrangian (17).

In the environments with commitment each agent plays a pure reporting strategy and

is that the posterior belief p replaces

The analysis of dynamic mechanism design problems with persistent shocks is more involved

since the recursive problem with additional state variables is more complicated. The broad
lessons about desirability of information revelation for high and low promised values (now
in the sense of increasing each element of vector v) still holds. First of all, the example in
13

Strictly speaking m should be replaces with any Borel set A of

Section 4.1 remains virtually unchanged. More speci…cally, in the Supplementary material we

0 (xv;

0 if 1=a 2 (0; 1) and v < 0 if 1=a < 0: We can

then conclude that no information revelation is optimal for low values of xv (i.e. x ! 0 if
1=a 2 [0; 1) and x ! 1 if 1=a < 0) and, when no bunching is desirable with commitment,

full information is optimal for high values of xv. We can also generalize Theorem 1 to the

persistent case (see the Supplementary material for details).

Final remarks

In this paper we took a step towards developing of theory of social insurance in a setting in
which the principal cannot commit. We focused on the simplest version of no commitment
that involves a direct, one-shot communication between the principal and agents, and showed
how such model can be incorporated into the standard recursive contracting framework with
relatively few modi…cations. Our approach can be extended to other types of communication. For example, a literature starting with a seminar work of Myerson (1982) considered
communication protocols that involve a mediator. Such protocols may further increase welfare (see, e.g. Bester and Strausz (2007)) but they require some ability to commit by the
policy maker to use the mediating device. The key di¤erence is that, after sending any message m; the agent receives a stochastic allocation, so that the incentive constraint (25) holds
in expectation rather than message-by-message. Two main insights of the paper – recursive
characterization and Theorems 1 and Theorems 2 –depend little on the detailed structure of
the incentive constraints. We believe that our analysis can be extended to such settings in a
relatively straightforward way and leave it to future research.
Another important direction that needs to be explored in future work is how the allocations
in best equilibria can be decentralized through a system of taxes and transfers. Some of the
most fruitful way to proceed may be to extend our basic set up to incorporate such margins as
labor supply or job search e¤ort, and consider decentralizations along the lines of labor taxation
in Albanesi and Sleet (2006) and unemployment insurance in Atkeson and Lucas (1995).

(Lemma

= 0 the problem is isomorphic to the standard

mechanism design problem and usual arguments apply to show that j j distinct allocations

represent a solution). The outcomes that occur with probability zero can be replaced with any
outcome from that set of 2j j

M can be restricted to at most 2j j

1 messages in (20), and hence, by Proposition 2, to M

in the modi…ed problem (17).

It remains to verify that it is a best equilibrium since not every solution to (17) needs to be
a PBE. Let (

;

G; p

) be a best PBE that generates (u ; M ) along the equilibrium path. By

the arguments leading to construction of problem (17), (u ;

given M : It is easy to show that any equilibrium is payo¤-equivalent to one in which the alP1 s t

((ut ; E

If removing all non-distinct messages leaves fewer than jM j messages, extra messages can

be added and agents strategies extended to keep posterior probabilities for such messages the

same as for some of the original messages. By appropriately choosing which messages to add it
is possible construct strategies that satisfy (25). This argument extends for all histories, and
hence any value that k0 (v) achieves given any M; can also be achieved given Mt = M for all
t: This completes the proof of Corollary 1.

Proofs for Section 4

First, we use Proposition 3 to simplify our problem. We drop explicit dependence of all
variables on z and throughout this section all the results are understood to hold for all z: By
Proposition 3 we can restrict attention to messages in a set Mv of cardinality no greater than
2j j

1 such that no two distinct reports give the agent the same allocation. We use Nv to

denote cardinality of Mv and Mv ( ) to denote the set of messages in Mv that maximize agent
’s utility. The incentive constraints (22) can be written as
u m0 + w m0 ;

u (m ) + w (m )
m0 j

u m0 + w m0

( u (m ) + w (m ))

so that uv (m1 ) < ::: < uv (mNv ) ; which also implies that wv (m1 ) > ::: > wv (mNv ) : Let
0

( ; m ; m0 ) and

00

( ; m ; m0 ) be Lagrange multipliers on the …rst and second constraint

(38). We set ( ; m; m0 ) = 0 for all m 2

v and observe that it can be maximized for each z separately, which yields (39).

which is expression (26).
For what follows, it is useful to establish bounds on the Lagrange multipliers. Consider

This, together with monotonicity of wv (m) ; establishes the upper bound in (29). Analogous

for low v:

First, suppose that utility is bounded below, without loss of generality by zero. From

converge to zero. Hence in the limit equation (47) becomes

is such that in the optimum it holds with equality.

Lucas (1992), who showed that for a wide range of cost functions C (including those satisfying

arbitrarily close to the lower bound v; the result known as the immiseration. Immiseration

Sketch of proofs of Propositions 1 and 2

We now adapt the arguments of Farhi and Werning (2007) to write problem (17) recursively.
When

t

is strictly positive with lim inf

t

> 0; the series f t gt are bounded away from zero

uniformly in t. The arguments of Lemma A2 of Farhi and Werning (2007) extend with minimal
modi…cations to problem (17) to show that it can be written in a recursive form
kt (v) = max E

where kt (v) is convex. To achieve convexity of this problem, it is su¢ cient to randomize between only two points in

t

Golosov and Tsyvinski (2008)), and hence this problem can be written as

adaptation of arguments in Farhi and Werning (2007). We show all the results for k0 ; for
all other kt the arguments are identical. For brevity we drop explicit conditioning of all
expectations on v:

a function V can be constructed separately for v

v0 and v > v0 : This shows that k0 (v) is

di¤erentiable.
To establish the value of the derivatives in the limits, note that when utility is bounded,

We are now ready to prove Proposition 4.
Proof of Proposition 4.

The solution to Bellman equation (20) may involve random-

ization over several v~v (z) that in expectations deliver v; but v~v (z) ! 1 for all z as v ! 1.

Consider maximization problem for a given z and assume that agents send reports over the
message set M

for all v: Using homogeneity properties of kt (v) ; if (u0v ; w0 ;

^

Since u; w are bounded from below by 0, arguments analogous to (45) establish that
h

wx (m)

lished that kt+1 (w; x) is continuous in x; the Theorem of Maximum applies and solution
correspondence (ux ; wx ;

x)

is u.h.c. in x:

We show that there cannot be several types

that send the same message m with a positive

probability for low x; which establishes the result of the Proposition. First, observe that there
must be some threshold x; such that for all x

x no two types send the same message with

probability 1. If this is not the case, we can choose a sequence xn ! 0 with solution
xn

satisfying such property, which by u.h.c. of

0

would imply that

xn

satis…es this property,

violating Lemma 15.
Next we rule out that several types send the same message with positive probability. Suppose that for any x we can …nd some x < x with this properties. There must be some type
who is indi¤erent between messages m0 and m00 : In this case condition (30) holds and takes

Arguments for case with persistent types

In the following proofs we assume that the set of feasible utility is bounded and, without loss
of generality, we set the lower bound to 0. Also, we assume that the message set Mt chosen by
the planner is …nite for all t. The proof that in the worst equilibrium there is no information
xvi

revelation to the government is the same as in the iid case. The payo¤ of this equilibrium
depends on the government’s information that dissipates slowly due to the persistence of the
shocks. Thus, the best payo¤ for a government that deviates at time t is

By Langrange duality we can prove the analogue of Lemma 2 in the iid case.

Lemma 16 The multiplier

pact set for all t and s. Therefore, uw

Finally, we adapt the arguments in Fernandes and Phelan (2000) with minor modi…cations
and obtain a recursive representation of (71). In particular, we …rst rewrite the constranit
set in a recursive form by adding the promise-keeping constraint (34) for each type

. Since

it is no longer optimal for agents to always report their types truthfully, unlike in the case
studied in Fernandes and Phelan (2000), the agent’ previous type,

, cannot be used as a

state variable. Instead, the recursive formulation keeps track of the planner’s posterion beliefs

We now extend the arguments of the simple example in Section 4.1 to the persistent case.
As in the iid case, the assumption that the government can deviate at time t

1 only if it

deviates at t = 0 implies that the Lagrangian (71) can be written as
( 1
)
X
t
L = max E
t C (ut )
0 W0
u;

t=0

subject to (72) and (73). Consider the subgame starting from t = 1. From past reports, the
planner has beliefs p 2
not bind at t

( ). Also, as in the iid case, since the sustainability constraint does

1, the standard Revelation principle applies and the agent will report his type

truthfully (let m denote the message corresponding to type .) Thus, as in Fernandes and
Phelan (2000), from time t
type. At time 1, let
1 (v; p)

The constraints are linear in (u; w), hence, if (u; w),

equation for some (v; p), it is immediate to see that (x u; x w),
also solve the Bellman equation for (x v; p) ; x > 0. Thus,

1 (v; p)

solve the Bellman

1 (v; p)

is homogenous in v. Also,

since the objective function is linear in p and the constraints are independent of p,

1 (v; p)

is

convex in p.

To prove Proposition 5 we need the following Lemma.
Lemma 17 Pr (uv;p (m; z) ! 0) ! 1 and Pr (wv;p (m; z; ) ! 0) ! 1 as v ! 0, for all m; ;

Here the fourth and …fth lines follow from nonnegativity of u and w; and the third line follows
R
from (75). Thus, limv!0 Z wv;p (m; z; ) dz = 0, 8m; ; p: Analogous arguments prove that
R
limv!0 Z uv;p (m; z) dz = 0, 8m; p. Since uv;p and wv;p are bounded below by 0; the latter
implies that Pr (uv;p (m; z) ! 0) ! 1 and Pr (wv;p (m; z; ) ! 0) ! 1 for all m; ; and p.

From Lemma 17, Pr (uv;p (m; z) ! 0) ! 1 and Pr (wv;p (m; z; ) ! 0) ! 1 for all m; ; and p

similarly to the iid case, Lemma 3 in Acemoglu, Golosov and Tsyvinski (2008) implies that it
