Liquidity and Foreign Asset Management Challenges for Latin American Countries

NBER Working Paper No. 20646
October 2014
JEL No. F15,F31,F32,F36,O13
ABSTRACT
We analyze the degree to which the growing importance of sovereign wealth funds [SWFs] and the
diffusion of inflation targeting and augmented Taylor rules have impacted the post crisis adjustment
of Latin American Countries (LATAM) to the challenges associated with terms of trade and financial
shocks. We confirm that active international reserves management reduces the effects of transitory
Commodity Terms of Trade (CTOT) shocks to the real exchange rate [REER] and the real GDP in
LATAM economies. These buffer effects work more against the risks of real appreciation than against
depreciations, under relatively high levels of external debt and in economies that are less open to trade.
Fixed exchange regimes act as a substitute policy to reserve accumulation. In contrast to reserves,
SWFs buffers the REER from CTOT shocks with fixed exchange rate regimes and in relatively closed
economies. The buffer effect of reserve accumulation appears to be strongest during the 1980-2007
period. While the stock of reserves fails to smooth the transmission of CTOT shocks to REER during
the Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009), SWFs stepped up as substitutes to traditional reserve assets.
The international reserve buffering role resumes during the post-great recession period (2010-2013),
but not at the levels observed prior to the crisis. We observe a "substitution" between reserves and SWFs,
where SWFs take over the buffering role of the REER and the real GDP during the Great Recession
and the post-Great Recession period. Inflation targeting (IT) policy matters: IT countries give up the
use of reserves to buffer against CTOT shocks, relegating this role to the SWFs. In LATAM countries
that follow augmented Taylor rules, their monetary authorities place large weights on output gaps;
while inflation gains importance for IT countries. Countries switch from REER stabilization targets
to inflation targets when committing to a formal IT rule. SWFs may provide IT countries with an
alternative form of liquidity management against foreign shocks when traditional reserves are committed
to other macroeconomic goals. This is true for both REER and output growth stabilization.

1. Introduction
The Global Financial Crisis put to the fore the challenges of managing liquidity and foreign
assets at times of heightened volatility. Earlier concerns of some observers regarding the costs of
precautionary hoarding notwithstanding, the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) validated the buffer value of
international reserves and active management of buffer funds. These issues are especially pertinent for
commodity exporters, where the high volatility of their commodity terms of trade translates into large
shocks impacting the real exchange rate, and the GDP.

The history of Latin American countries

provides ample examples where adverse terms of trade shocks terminated spells of ‘good time,’ leading
to capital flight and financial crises.
Intriguingly, ‘this time has been different’ for countries that followed during the 2000s the
dictum of “save for rainy day,” opting for counter-cyclical macro policies, Chile being the prime
example of it [Céspedes and Velasco (2012, 2014)]. Frankel (2011) found that since 2000, fiscal policy
in Chile has been governed by a structural budget rule that has succeeded in implementing
countercyclical fiscal policy.1 Furthermore, Frankel, Vegh and Vuletin (2011) found that, over the last
decade, about a third of the developing world has been become countercyclical.
In commodity exporting countries, pro-active liquidity, exchange rate and foreign assets
management have supported such fiscal policy. Using the pre GFC data, Aizenman and Riera Crichton
(2008) found that international reserves cushion the impact of terms-of-trade shocks on the real
exchange rate (REER), and that this effect is especially significant for countries exporting natural
resources. Financial depth reduces the buffer role of international reserves in developing countries. In a
more detailed analysis, Aizenman, Edwards and Riera-Crichton (2012) found that active reserve
management not only lowers the short run impact of commodity terms of trade (CTOT) shocks
significantly, but also affects the long run adjustment of REER, effectively lowering its volatility.
Relatively small increases in the average holdings of reserves by Latin American economies, to levels
still well below other emerging regions current averages, provided a policy tool as effective as a fixed
exchange rate regime in insulating the economy from CTOT shocks. Reserve management could be an
effective alternative to fiscal or currency policies for relatively trade closed countries and economies
with relatively poor institutions or high government debt. Céspedes and Velasco (2012), using
A crucial ingredient accounting for Chile’s success is the official estimates of trend output and the 10-year price
of copper – which are key to the decomposition of the budget in Chile into structural versus cyclical components
– are made by independent expert panels and thus insulated from the political process.

commodity price boom and bust episodes, provided empirical evidence that commodity price shocks
have a significant impact on output and investment dynamics. Economies with more flexible exchange
rate regimes exhibit less pronounced responses of output during these episodes. They also found that the
impact of those shocks on investment tends to be larger for economies with less developed financial
markets. Moreover, international reserve accumulation, more stable political systems, and less open
capital accounts tend to reduce the real exchange rate appreciation (depreciation) in episodes of
commodity price booms (busts), respectively.
The purpose of this paper is to revisit these issues, extending earlier analysis by looking at the
degree to which the more recent data (up to 2013), and the new institutional developments validate the
earlier results that relied on pre-GFC data. Specifically, we analyze the degree to which the growing
importance of sovereign wealth funds [SWFs], and the diffusion of inflation targeting and augmented
Taylor rules have impacted the post crisis adjustment of LATAM to the challenges associated with
terms of trade and financial shocks.2
Extending the dataset to 2013, we are able to replicate our previous results: stock of reserves and
active management reduce the effects of transitory Commodity Terms of Trade (CTOT) shocks to real
exchange rate in LATAM economies. This “buffer effect” seems to work more against risk of real
appreciation than against risks of depreciations. Fixed exchange regimes acts as a substitute policy to
reserve accumulation, and this buffering policy seems to work under relatively high levels of external
debt, and in economics that are less open to trade. We confirm the income effects of CTOT - positive
correlation of CTOT shocks and the real GDP growth. The positive association between the two seems
to be stronger with negative shocks, for low debt and opener economies.

Accumulation (de-

accumulation) of reserves helps in buffering the transmission of positive (negative) CTOT shocks to
output, respectively.
SWFs add new dimensions to foreign asset managements. In contrast to reserves, SWFs seem
important to buffer the real exchange rate [REER] from CTOT shocks with fixed exchange rate regimes
and in relatively closed economies. SWFs also reinforce the effects of CTOT shocks on real output
during negative shocks with fixed exchange rate regimes, and buffer the effect for relatively high
external debt levels. Our buffer story seems to show its strongest version during the 80’s, 90’s and the
end of the Great Moderation (2003-2007). Yet, during the great recession (2008-2009) we observe
See Aizenman and Glick (2010) for overview of the diffusion of SWFs, and possible division of labor between SWFs and
Central Banks. See Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007), Aizenman, Hutchison and Noy (2011) and Céspedes, Chang, and
Velasco (2012) for analysis on Inflation Targeting in practice.

disconnect between CTOT and REER, and the role of reserves. The REER-CTOT relationship seems to
resume during the post-great recession period (2010-2013) and reserve buffering returns but not at the
levels observed previous to the crisis. The same story applies for active use of reserves, except that our
buffer story returns in a stronger fashion during the post-recession period.
There seems to be a “substitution” between reserves and SWF, where SWFs take over the
buffering of the REER and the real GDP during the Great Recession and the post-Great Recession
period. Inflation targeting policy seems to matter, potentially diverting resources to the preservation of
domestic price stability: IT countries seems to give up the use of reserves to buffer against CTOT
shocks, relegating this role to the SWFs. In LATAM countries that seem to follow augmented Taylor
rule, their monetary authorities seem to place large weight of output gaps; while inflation seems to gain
importance for IT countries. The nature of the regime matters - non IT countries seem to switch from
REER stabilization target to an inflation target when committing to a formal IT rule.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we define the data used in the paper
as well as present a set of summary statistics describing the evolution of external liquidity as well as
CTOT shocks over the last three decades. Section 3 presents our econometric strategy to uncover the
way CTOT shocks affect macroeconomic performance measures such as the real exchange rates and
Output growth, both in the short and long runs. We also show the proposed methods to capture the role
of international reserves in smoothing temporary TOT shocks under a set of alternative macroeconomic
regimes. In Section 4, we discuss our econometric results from the analysis of the buffering effect from
the stock of reserves and the stock of sovereign wealth funds. These results include an investigation of
the buffer effect of liquidity management following positive versus negative CTOT shocks, under
different exchange rate regimes, different stocks of external debt and different degrees of trade
openness. Section 5 looks at the changes in the CTOT-REER and CTOT-Growth relationship as well as
our buffer story over different sample periods. Specifically, we look at the turbulent period from 1980 to
2002, the Great Moderation, the Great Recession and the period following the global crisis up to the
present. Section 6 looks at the relationship between reserves and sovereign wealth funds as competing
tools for international liquidity management. Section 7 explores the role of other monetary policies
implemented in Latin American economies in the last two decades. The section focuses on the adoption
of inflation rules by half the countries in our sample. Section 8 concludes.

2. Macroeconomic performance, Commodity TOT shocks and liquidity management in Latin America
Looking at the macroeconomic performance of the largest economies (LAC-7) in Latin America
over the last two decades as shown in Table 1, we see that “this time was really different”. LAC-7
economies did experience a slowdown in growth and increase in volatility during the Great Recession
relative to the “good times” of the Great Moderation. Nevertheless, the slowdown did not turn into a
crash as in previous occasions and most countries continued to experience real appreciations against the
dollar throughout the worst of the crisis. Furthermore, the recovery was “fast and furious” with average
rates of annual growth above five percent, rates of real appreciation of almost three and a half percent
per year and lower macroeconomic volatility than in the Great Moderation. In this paper we investigate
the role of active liquidity management in this success story.
Traditionally, one of the main transmission mechanisms of global real shocks to Latin American
economies has been sudden changes in relative international prices. In this paper, we use a “commodity
terms of trade” (CTOT) data set to analyze the way in which shocks to commodity prices affect key
macroeconomic performance measures such as changes in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) or
Output Growth. Our analysis focuses on the twelve largest Latin American economies: Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela. As shown in previous work, this set of emerging countries has the highest volatility in
CTOT. Our current work covers the period 1980-2014 but focuses special attention to the period of
relatively low volatility before the great recession, dubbed the end of the great moderation (2002-2007),
the great recession (2008-2009) and the period post great recession (2010-2013). Our key measure, the
concept of “commodity terms of trade”, follows Ricci et. al (2008), and differs from the traditional
measure in that it only includes the relative prices of a country’s commodity exports and imports,
weighted by their country specific GDP shares. By excluding industrial goods, and concentrating on
commodity prices, we focus on the most volatile component of import and exports prices. Specifically,
this commodity terms-of-trade data set was constructed as follows: CTOTi  j ( Pj / MUV ) X / j ( Pj / MUV ) M ,
i
j

i
j

where Pj is the price index for six commodity categories (food, fuels, agricultural raw materials, metals,
gold, and beverages), and ( X ij , M ij ) are the average shares of commodity j in country i‘s exports and
imports over GDP for the period 1980 through 2012, respectively. Commodity prices are deflated by the
manufacturing unit value index (MUV). Since X ij and M ij are averaged over time, the movements in
5

CTOT are invariant to changes in export and import volumes in response to price fluctuations, and thus,
isolate the impact of commodity prices on a country’s terms of trade.3 Another useful property of this
measure of CTOT arises from the use of export/import over GDP as our weights, this allows us to
reinterpret CTOT shocks as income shocks to the home economy and builds a direct link to effects on
aggregate income and production.
Figure 1gives us an overview of the evolution of CTOT shocks volatility overtime as well as the
accumulation of international liquidity and composition of this liquidity by Latin American economies
over the last three decades. While CTOT shock volatility doubled during the Great Recession, volatility
was already persistently high across the previous twenty years. In spite of this high volatility, LATAM
economies managed to achieve low output and REER volatility during the last decades, including the
Great Recession. Part of this success may have been achieved thanks to a set of countercyclical fiscal
policies and, more relevant to our work, a set of monetary policies dedicated to carefully manage
international liquidity in order to lower price and output volatility. In this light, figure 1A shows how
Latin American economies had started to accumulate large amounts of foreign reserves well before the
last crisis. This accumulation drove LATAM economies to move from an average stock of reserves of
7.5 percent of GDP before the Great Moderation to more than 15% after the Great Recession.
Figure 1B showcases the appearance of stabilization sovereign wealth funds (SWF) as an
alternative source of International liquidity. Most of these SWFs acted as automatic stabilizers following
some fiscal rule dedicated to manage the windfalls from abnormal high prices of the commodities
typically exported by each country. Table 2 in the appendix depicts the SWF used in this analysis.
Figure 1C shows the country composition of the aggregate balance of these stabilization funds in
the region. While Chile has been the clear leader of the pack, accumulating close to 20 billion dollars in
its copper fund before the crisis, other countries like Mexico, Colombia and later in the sample Peru
have been increasing their SWFs thanks to windfalls from their energy (oil and gas) funds. Venezuela
was able to accumulate a large amount of funds in the early 2000’s but then their fund was liquidated
and has not been active since. Another relevant policy change adopted by LATAM countries during the
nineties was a set of explicit inflation targets. As shown in table 3, up to half of the countries in our
3

By construction, a percentage increase (decrease) in the commodity terms of trade measure is approximately
equal to the aggregate net trade gain (loss) relative to GDP from changes in real individual commodity prices (see
Spatafora and Tytell (2009)). See the Appendix of NBER working paper # 17692 for further details regarding the
derivation of CTOT, Data Definitions and sources.

sample became inflation targeters. Potentially, Inflation targeting represents an important part of our
buffer story since inflation-targeting (IT) countries may to deviate resources from REER stabilization to
internal price stabilization.
3. Macroeconomic adjustment and commodity terms of trade shocks
Following previous work, in this paper we use a fixed effects error correction model to capture
the effects of CTOT shocks and the dynamic adjustment of REER and Output Growth. Our basic
framework is represented by equation (1):
Ln( X )it  i  1Ln( X )it1  2 ECMX it1 [1   2Yit1 ] TCTOTit1  2Yit1  it

(1)

where X corresponds to one of our two measure of macroeconomic performance: 1) REER, the
effective (trade weighted) real exchange rate4. 2) Real GDP. ECTX is the error correction term for (the
logarithm of) the X. As usual, this term is defined as the log deviations of X from its equilibrium value.
In order to compute the equilibrium/long-run REER, we use a co-integrating approach. 5 The long run
value of output growth is obtained applying an HP Filter to the original series with a smoothing
parameter set at 1600. Similarly, the term TCTOT represents transitory CTOT shocks, and is defined as
the log deviations of current CTOT from its long run value. The latter, again, is obtained applying an HP
Filter to the original series with a smoothing parameter set at 1600. Finally, Y represents our liquidity
measure. In this paper we will use the stock of international reserves to GDP ratio, the stock of SWF to
GDP ratio and the change of these ratios as our proxies for liquidity management policy.
To investigate the potential differences in our buffer story over different sample periods, different
macroeconomic/policy structures or asymmetric underlying shocks, we use another layer of nonlinearities to our approach:
Ln( X )it   i  1Ln( X )it1   2 ECMX it1 [( 2 * Z)  ( 4 * Z)Yit1 ] TCTOTit1  2Yit1  it

(2)

For the rest of the empirical section REER is defined as foreign currency in terms of the domestic currency, e.g.
an increase in REER corresponds to a real appreciation of the domestic currency
5
See Edwards (1989), Montiel (1999) derivation long-run REER is detailed in the appendix.

Where Z is defined as a vector of dummy variables that splits the regression by sample period or by
different economic structure such as degree of trade openness, indebtedness or exchange rate regime.
To provide a more dynamic look of the effects of CTOT shocks to REER and Output and the
potential for our buffering effect under different conditions, we set up a series of accumulated impulse
response functions (IRF). To build these IRF, we follow the single-equation approach advocated by
Jorda (2005) and Stock and Watson (2007), which does not impose the dynamic restrictions implicitly
embedded in the SVAR methodology and can conveniently accommodate non-linearities in the response
function. We use these linear local projections (LP) of real appreciation and output growth on our
dynamic error correction model:

Ln( X )ith 

i,h  1,h Ln( X )it1   2,h ECMX it1 [( 2,h * Zit )  ( 4,h * Zit )Yit ] TCTOTit  2,hYit1  it

(3)

where Ln( X )ith  Ln( X )ith  Ln( X )it1 .It is important to note that, in this approach, each step in the
accumulated IRF is obtained from a different individual equation. We thus obtain the IRF values directly
from the coefficients in each equation “h”. As explained in Jorda (2005), there are multiple advantages
in the use of LP. In particular, LP (i) can be estimated by single-regression techniques (least-squares
dummy variables or LSDV in our case), (ii) are more robust to potential misspecifications, and (iii) can
accommodate highly non-linear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate
SVAR (Structural vector autoregression) context.

4. Has liquidity and foreign asset management buffered LATAM countries from external real shocks?
Results from a pooled regression.

8

We start our results section updating our previous work on the buffer role of foreign reserves
with quarterly data until 2013. All regressions include all available data. The pooled regressions include
a quarterly sample that ranges from 1980 to 2013. Not all countries have a full sample of data so our
panel regressions are unbalanced. Descriptive statistics of all the variables are summarized in table 4.
Tables 5 and 6 corroborate our previous findings in our updated dataset. Table 5 reports the estimation
of the basic model using the stock of reserves over GDP as a proxy for “liquidity availability”.
Meanwhile, table 6 uses the change in reserves as a proxy for “active reserve management”. In both
tables the first column confirms a positive correlation between TCOT and REER, column two
showcases our basic reserve buffer story: a stock of reserve of 15 percent of GDP or a change in reserve
holdings of 3 percent of GDP can, in average, decrease the REER effects of CTOT shocks on impact in
half. To see the gains of this policy more clearly and in a dynamic environment we show the dynamic
IRF in Figure 2. Moving the stock of reserves from 5 percent to 15 percent decreases the REER
volatility (measured as the standard deviation of the point estimates on the IRF) in almost 30 percent
over the following two years.
Columns 3-6 in tables 5 and 6 use dummy variables to estimate the differences in our buffer
story given different policy and macroeconomic structure. Results in both tables are very similar; the
buffer effect works against risk of real appreciation more than against risk of depreciation. 6 Fixed
exchange regimes seem to act as a substitute policy to reserve accumulation. Reserve management
appears to be a more effective policy under relatively high levels of external and the buffer policy works
in relatively trade close economies.
Given the potentially direct relationship between CTOT shocks and income shocks, countries
may choose to stabilize output rather than REER. In tables 7 and 8 we explore the role of reserve
accumulation and active reserve management as output stabilizing polices. The first column in both
tables confirms the direct income effect of CTOT shocks with a strong positive correlation between both
measures. Interestingly, columns 3, 5 and 6 show this income effect being stronger under negative
shocks, low debt and relatively open economies. While column three does not provide clear evidence of
our buffer effect for neither stock of reserves nor change in reserves, column for on table 8 shows that
6

This asymmetry may reflect country’s concern that losing reserves during a downturn might increase
its vulnerability to deleveraging and sudden stops. In addition, deflationary shocks (drops in commodity
prices, collapsing export demands, etc.) may mitigate concerns of the inflationary consequences
associated with depreciation, increasing the perceived gain of depreciation as a form of demand
switching policy, improving the competitiveness of a country.
9

accumulation and de-accumulation of reserves buffers the transmission of positive and negative CTOT
shocks to output. Results from the IRF in this last specification portray a slightly different picture.
Figure 3A shows a clear role of active reserve management on stabilizing output volatility under
positive shocks. Increasing the rate at which the country accumulates reserves from 1 percent to 3
percent of GDP helps decrease the volatility of the output after positive CTOT shocks by 26 percent
over the following two years. On the opposite end, figure 3B shows that while de-accumulation of
reserves seems to help decrease the effect of negative CTOT shocks into output on impact, this policy
seems to have an insignificant role buffering the CTOT shock in the following periods.
As mentioned above, an important extension to our previous work with reserves consists in
looking at the effects of managing foreign assets in the form of SWF balances. The SWF included in this
study follow a set of fiscal rules that allow countries to manage windfalls from increases in the
international prices of the exporting commodities. Tables 9 and 10 report the estimated coefficients for
our basic model using the balance of SWF as our proxy for access to international liquidity. While the
most significant effects are obtained in the study of different periods (see table 11 and text below), there
are some interesting results captured by tables 9 and 10; first, in contrast to what we observed with
reserves, SWF seem to act as an important buffer to REER under fixed exchange rate regimes and
relatively close economies. Additionally, SWF buffers the effect on Output growth for relatively high
debt observations. Interestingly, holding large SWF balances seem to increase, instead of decrease, the
effects of CTOT shocks on real output during negative shocks and under fixed exchange regimes. As
explained in the next section of the paper, this effect may reflect the period of SWF accumulation just
before the Great Recession. Once we divide the sample in different periods of interest, we observe that
SWF start buffering the CTOT effects on Output during and after the Great Recession, replacing
reserves on this role.
5. What were the effects of the Great Recession on our buffer story?
One of the more important questions in this project is to examine the effects of the Great
Recession. In this section we apply our basic model of liquidity buffer to four distinct periods in time,
each with a special economic significance for LATAM region. Our first sample period covers data
ranging from the beginning of 1980s to the end of 2002. These are turbulent times in Latin America. Just
10

to cover a few of the major economic crises we have the debt crisis in 1982 that led to the lost decade,
the Tequila crises in 1994-95 and the Argentinian crises in 2001-02. Many Latin American economies
were plagued by hyperinflation during this period and carried high output and real exchange rate
volatility. From Table 11 we see how the buffer effect, measured from either the stock of reserves or its
active management, is strongest during this period. To further this point we compare the IRFs from
holding 5% or 15% of GDP in reserves in Figure 4A. From this figure we observe a very large decrease
in REER volatility, specifically volatility in the IRF drops by almost 45%. We could argue that in the
absence of credible inflation rules or other countercyclical fiscal policies, liquidity (through international
reserves) management was one of the strongest tools for emerging LATAM economies to lower
inherited macroeconomic volatility. These two decades are the poster child for our international liquidity
buffer story.
The second period of interest runs from 2003 to 2007. Due to the relatively low macroeconomic
volatility in many emerging regions, this period it’s commonly dubbed as the end of the Great
Moderation (GM). During this time the relationship between CTOT shocks and real appreciation
remains positive but we lose some significance in our regressions. As shown by the IRFs in Figure 4B,
the buffer effect of reserves remained strong, delaying any reaction of REER to changes in CTOT by
more than a year. The Great Recession (GR) brings a change in the previously found empirical
regularities. In short, the link between CTOT and REER seems to decrease substantially and any role for
reserves to buffer the shocks disappears. Figure 4C clearly represents this change. Finally, we observe
the relationship between CTOT and REER and our buffer story reappear during the years following the
GR (2010 to 2013). Nevertheless, neither the link between CTOT and REER nor the buffer effect of
reserves return to the levels observed before the crises.
Interestingly, while the stock of reserves fails to smooth the transmission of CTOT shocks to
REER during the Great Recession, we observe SWF stepping up as a potential substitute to traditional
reserve assets. Figure 5A and 5B show how moving the stock of SWF assets from 1 to 3 percent of GDP
decreased volatility in the GR and the post GR period by 16 and 32 percent respectively. Column 6 of
table 11 shows that SWF were also effective smoothing the transmission of CTOT shocks to real output
growth during the GR and the post GR periods.
6. International Reserves versus Sovereign Wealth Funds: Substitutes or Complements?

11

Results in the previous section show that during the Great Recession (2007-9) and the following
years, SWF seemed to inherit the role of buffering LATAM economies against real external shocks
previously assigned to international reserves. In this section, we want to look closely at the relationship
between the two different tools of liquidity management over last two decades. In order to understand
the short run relationship between movements in the stock of reserves and movements in the balance of
SWF we build two error correction models as follows:

∆

where RES and SWF represents the stock of reserves and the total balance of SWF as a ratios of GDP.
The results of running these regressions for the full sample of countries and years, starting from 2003
(where most SWF start to arise) and restricting the sample to countries that had Stabilization SWFs are
shown in Table 12. Interestingly, we observe that an increase on assets in SWFs seems to be associated
to a significant decrease of International reserves on impact in all specifications. These negative
correlations range from .32 to .54 percent of GDP decrease in reserves in the face of a 1 percent of GDP
increase in SWF balances. Moreover, looking at the three lags in our specification, we find joint
significance for all betas at 99 percent confidence level. The same cannot be said when we look at the
SWF equation; we find that changes in reserves are not associated to significant changes in SWF.
Looking at the impulse responses over a two-year time horizon in figures 6 and 7, gives us an
even clearer picture. In figure 6A we observe that a 1 percent of GDP increase in SWF balances carries a
negative and significant (at 95% confidence level) accumulated effect on reserves of approximately .34
percent of GDP on impact and a maximum effect of .56 percent after one quarter. Again, looking at
figure 6B, there seems to be no reaction on SWF after changes on reserves. Figures 7A and 7B show
similar results if we consider only countries with active SWFs over our sample (Chile, Colombia,
12

Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela).

This evidence seems to reaffirm our substitution story. The

emergence of SWF during the 2000’s seemed to provide a valid substitute tool for active liquidity
management policies in LATAM countries.

While further analysis of these interesting policy

interactions seems warranted, we leave a more in-depth analysis for future work.

7. Liquidity management and Inflation Targeting
A key monetary policy change to explain macroeconomic performance in Latin American over
the last decade and a half is the move by half of our sample to inflation targeting. In this section we
investigate how target rules affected the ability or willingness of LATAM economies to use international
liquidity to reduce the macroeconomic volatility inherited from external shocks.
In order to understand the policy goals of LATAM economies we start by setting up an
augmented Taylor rule were we fit the domestic policy rate to a measure of the output gap, CPI inflation
and real appreciation. In an alternative specification we use non-linear dummy approach to separate the
sample between IT and Non-IT countries. Table 13 reports the estimated coefficients. Interpreting these
coefficients as the weights across macroeconomic policy goals, we observe that output gaps seem to be
the most important component for setting up the policy rate. While inflation seems to gain importance
for IT countries, the weight in the Taylor rule seems relatively small. Importantly for our study, Non-IT
countries seem to switch from a REER target to an inflation target when committing to an IT rule. This
means, potentially, that liquidity management is not-longer used towards the stabilization of REER
under an IT rule. To investigate this possibility, we adjust our basic specification to account for IT
countries and show the results in table 14. Figure 8 builds the IRF for Non-IT vs. IT countries. As
expected, liquidity management seems to be efficient only across Non-IT countries reducing CTOT
volatility by 35 percent over two years in the IRF. The relationship between CTOT and REER becomes
more chaotic and the buffer story disappears among IT countries. Based on columns 2 and 4 from table
14, SWF seem to provide IT countries with an alternative form of liquidity management against foreign
shocks when traditional reserves are committed to other macroeconomic goals. This is true for both
REER and output growth stabilization.

13

8. Conclusion
Our paper documents and validates the growing importance of liquidity management for
commodity exporting countries, mitigating the transmission from terms of trade shocks to the real
exchange rate, stabilizing thereby the domestic economy. We find evidence that SWFs may provide
another margin of stabilization, and this role may be of greater relevance for IT countries, and in periods
of heightened volatility. This division of labor is consistent with Tinbergen rule in policy design: to
reach n targets, one may use n independent instruments. International reserves are useful in dealing with
balance sheet exposure, aiming at short and intermediate run stabilization objectives. Yet, hoarding
international reserves is not a panacea, as the opportunity cost of reserves imposes a fiscal cost, and
hoarding reserves may require sterilization to mitigate their inflationary consequences.

Thereby,

an inflation targeting regime may relegate the goal of real exchange rate stabilization to a sovereign
wealth fund. Such a fund may have greater risk tolerance, and its accumulation impacts directly the
fiscal stance and the real exchange rate.7 Remarkably, the buffering roles of reserves and SWFs does
not need East Asian levels of hoarding – they are operative in LATAM at relatively modest levels of
reserves/GDP and SWF/GDP.

7

This assignment is consistent with the view that IR has comparative advantage in dealing with balance sheet
exposure, SWF with longer term saving, and fiscal stabilization.

Appendix A Data Definition and Sources
CTOT: Commodity terms-of-trade data set was constructed following Ricci et. al (2008):
Xi

CTOTi  ( Pj / MUV ) j / ( Pj / MUV )
j

j

M ij

,

where Pj is the price index for six commodity categories (food, fuels, agricultural raw materials, metals,
gold, and beverages), and (Xij , Mij) are the average shares of commodity j in country i‘s exports and
imports over GDP for the period 1980 through 2012, respectively. Commodity prices are deflated by the
manufacturing unit value index (MUV). Sources: UN ComTrade, IMF, World Bank
TCTOT: Transitory CTOT shocks are defined as the log deviations of actual CTOT from long run
values calculated through a HP filter.
REER: Real effective exchange rate is defined a trade based weighted average of nominal bilateral
exchange rates deflated by the relative consumer price indexes. An increase in REER represents a real
appreciation of the domestic currency. DREER represents the log change in REER. Sources:
DataStream, IMF
RES: The stock of foreign reserve assets is measured in millions of us dollars and deflated by the five
year moving average of the interpolated annual nominal Gross Domestic Product. DRES represents the
change in the reserves to GDP ratio. Global Financial Data, IMF
ECMREER: Error correction REER is the log difference between current REER and long term REER.
In order to compute the equilibrium/long-run REER, we use a co-integrating approach. The
methodology calls for a series of co-integrating regressors. Following Edwards (1989), Montiel (1999)
and others, we estimate the following equation:



Ln(REER)t     

(A-1)

The term CTOT is commodity terms of trade, Gov represents the share of Government Expenditures
over GDP, TradeOpen is a measure of Trade Openness (Exports plus Imports over GDP), USINF is a
measure of inflation in the US based on the US CPI and represents world inflation and IntSpread is the
domestic market reference interest rate spread from the 3-month US T-Bill. Once we obtain the
coefficients from equation (A-1), we use the HP filter to find the long run values of the fundamentals,
we then use these values, jointly with the estimated coefficients, to generate what we refer to as the
Long Run REER (LRREER). Sources: World Bank, Penn Tables.
RGDP: Real GDP is taking at a true quarterly frequency from different sources. The table below shows
the source and data availability. DRGDP represents the log change in RGDP.

FIXED vs FLEX FOREX DUMMIES: Using the de facto exchange rate regime classification of
Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2008), we define, a nominal fixed exchange regime as one where the
country either has no legal tender, a hard peg, a crawling peg, and de facto or pre-announced bands or
crawling bands with margins of no larger than +/- 2%. All other arrangements are classified as nominal
flexible regimes (we exclude episodes of “Free Falling” from the sample of the regression). Sources:
TRADE OPEN VS. CLOSE DUMMIES: Based on the literature we consider a country to be “Open”
if our ratio (EX+IM)/GDP is larger than 40% and close if its lower than 40%.
HIGH VS. LOW DEBT DUMMIES: We consider High Government Debt any amount over 45
percent of GDP.

IT: Inflation targeting is a dummy with value 1 if the country is officially targeting inflation and zero
otherwise. The table 3 shows the IT country/periods. Target bands and transition periods.
SWF: Balance of Sovereign Wealth Fund balances obtained from commodity revenues and dedicated
to macroeconomic stabilization. SWF is measured in millions of US dollars and is deflated by the five
year moving average of the interpolated annual nominal GDP. DSWF represents the change in SWF
balance over GDP ratio. See table 2 for the summary of the funds.

DRGDP represents real output growth. TCTOT represents transitory commodity terms of trade shocks. IT is a dummy with
value 1 if the country is targeting inflation 0 otherwise . RES are the stock of international reserves over GDP. DRES is the
change in RES. SWF are the balance of sovereign wealth funds over GDP. Quarterly observations from 1980Q1 to 2013Q4.
For output regressions observations under hyperinflation episodes (>100% inflation) are not included.
