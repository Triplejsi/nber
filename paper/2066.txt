Forecasting Recessions Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Law

ABSTRACT

The targeted deficit reductions of the Gramm—Rudman—Hollings (GRE)
law are to be temporarily suspended in case of an official determination
that real economic growth either (a) has been less than one percent in
the two most recent reported quarters, or (b) is projected to be less

than zero in any two consecutive quarters out the next six. This amounts
to a particular definition of recession. But business cycles are best
identified by the consensus of movements in the principal economic

aggregates. Not all recessions are associated with real GNP declining
or growing less than 1% for two successive quarters. Also, GNP estimates
are subject to long sequences of revisions that are often large.
We show that, for these reasons, conditioning a suspension of
deficit cuts upon specific changes in preliminary data for real GNP involves

very long lags in recognizing recessions. The recessions would be largely
over before they were identified. We also show that forecasts of real
GNP, based on the consensus among groups of professional forecasters,

can reduce these lags considerably. This is so despite the fact that
early and accurate predictions of business cycle peaks are rare, and
false warnings occur.

FORECASTING RECESSIONS UNDER THE GRAMM-RUDMAN LAW

Introduction

The Grani-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) law passed by the Congress in December
1985 establishes a process whereby the Federal budget deficits are to be

gradually phased out by the fiscal year (FY) 1991. A series of targeted
ceilings on the unified budget deficit is instituted, beginning with $172
billion for Fl 1986 and $11t billion for Fl 1987 and proceeding by decrements

of $36 billion per year to zero in FY 1991. The planned reductions are to be
achieved by spending and tax measures agreed upon by the legislative and

executive branches of the U.S. government. However, if an agreement is not
reached, the target for any FY is to be achieved through an automatic acrossthe-board spending cut in all eligible defense and nondefense categories.
Early in 1986 a lower court ruled that the sequestering provision of GRH is
unconstitutional; this ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court on July 7,
1986. This does not pertain to the issues discussed in this paper.
Section 2514 of the GRH law provides for "Special Procedures in the Event

of a Recession." It states that the Congressional Budget Office (CEO)
Director shall notify the Congress at any time (a) if the CBO or the Office of
Management and Budget (0MB) "has determined that real economic growth is
projected or estimated to be less than zero with respect to each of any two
consecutive quarters" within a period of six successive quarters starting with
the one preceding such notification, or (b) "if the Department of Commerce
preliminary report of actual real economic growth (or any subsequent revision
thereof) indicates that the rate of real economic growth for each of the most
recent reported quarter and the immediately preceding quarter is less than one
percent."

Upon receiving the CEO Directors notification, both Houses commit

2

themselves to procedures designed to suspend several GRH provisions. These
concern the maximum deficits for the current and the next fiscal year, and the
corresponding spending and revenue levels.
In short, the targeted deficit reductions are to be suspended when a
recession is either (a) forecast by CBO or 0MB or both, or (b) reported as
being under way by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the U.S.

Department of Commerce. This is important since the spending cuts and/or tax
increases needed to produce the deficit reductions might seriously aggravate

the recession. And the probability that a recession will occur at some time
during the long period between the present and the end of FY 1991 must
certainly be viewed as rather high.
This paper addresses three questions in the following order:

(1) How accurately and promptly has the Commerce report that real GNP growth
fell below 1% in two consecutive quarters identified previous business

recessions? This is an attempt to trace the implications of provision (b)
above with the aid of historical data.

(2) What can reasonably be expected from the past record of economic
forecasters with respect to their ability to predict a recession defined
as two consecutive quarters of' decline in real GNP? This is a similar
attempt to trace the implications of provision (a) above.

(3) How do the foregoing results compare with alternative signals of recession
based upon leading indicators and employment data?

2. Defining and Recognizing Recessions
The conditions under which the deficit reductions otherwise mandated
under GRH would be suspended imply two

alternative

definitions of a business

recession. One of these requires at ieast two consecutive quarters during

3

which "real economic growth" stays below zero: this refers to the CBO or 0MB
forecasts. The other, used with reference to the BEA reports, is a sequence
of at least two quarters with growth rates of less than one percent. It is
clear from the language employed in some earlier sections of the law that the

criterion in both cases is growth of GNP in constant dollars.1 The difference
between the two definitions suggests that the legislators may have thought
that forecasts of negative growth were more likely to identify actual
recessions than forecasts of very low but still positive growth.

defining and recognizing recessions from data limited to the quarterly

series on output of the U.S. economy (GNP in constant dollars). One
difficulty here is that some generally recognized recessions have not been

marked by two consecutive declines in this series. Thus in 1960 total U.S.
output fell in the second and fourth quarters but not in the third quarter,
and in 1980 it fell in the second quarter only (Table 1).

In these cases,

then, the criterion of two successive declines in real GNP would have produced

no recognition of a recession at all. However, in both these instances the
criterion of two quarters of less than one percent growth was met, which may

account for the alternative definition in the GRH. Nevertheless, any
individual indicator series, even one as comprehensive and important as GNP,

can measure only some of the aspects of aggregate economic activity. Also,
all such series contain measurement errors that are in part independent and

1Both the House Amendment and the Senate Amendment in section VI ("Economic
Conditions") of GRH contain similar provisions regarding the predicted and
actual real growth rates. The House version also referred to the event that
the average rate of unemployment for two consecutive months is one percent
above the same two months for the previous year, but this particular trigger
was dropped in the Conference greement (see Congressional Record-House,
December 10, 1985, p. H—11710).

revealed by data revisions. For these reasons, business cycles are better
identified from the consensus of' key macroeconomic indicators for employment,

production, real income and real sales than from any single one of these

series. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has always relied on
this principle in developing its much tested and widely accepted chronology of

recessions and recoveries. The peak and trough dates in our tables are those
determined by NBER.

Table 1 compares the recessions as dated by MBER (columns 1-3) with
periods of two or more consecutive quarters during which the economy grew less

than one percent (SAAR). Ten such sequences of low or negative growth rates
occurred in the presently available historical series of real GNP for 1914882
(part A, column 14), whereas the number of concurrent business cycle

contractions is eight. Thus the GRH definition that counts low rises along
with declines in total output yields two additional "recessions." One of
these relates to a mild two-quarter slowdown that preceded the downturn of'

January 1980 by about a year, a serious discrepancy. The other merely
involves a single-quarter interruption of' the 1981-82 decline in real GNP.

When the two episodes are excluded, the peak signal dates from the historical
series (mid-months of quarters preceding the low-growth periods, see column 5)

are found to be on the average coincident with the business cycle peaks. The
range of these timing comparisons is from a lead of LI months to a lag of' 6

months, the standard deviation is 3 months (column 7).
For a time, the earliest estimates for G\JP were published in the last

month of the quarter as the "flash report," based on very incomplete data and

often subject to large revisions. Iow the first report is published in the
first month of the following quarter, and in he earlier years the publication
lags were longer. In Table 1, the ef'fective

data

release dates are taken to

5

fall in the month following the second quarter with real growth of less than

one percent (column 6). The recognition lags, measured from the reference
peak dates to these data release dates, are listed in the last column of the
table; excepting the two false signals noted before, their range is +4 to ÷iL,

with a mean of +8 and standard deviation of 3 months. For six of the seven
recessions, the recognition lag was at least 6 months. These results are
about what one would expect, given the requirement of at least two successive
quarters of very low or negative growth, the roughly coincident cyclical
timing of real GNP, and the informational delays involved.
Of course, the data used in Table 1, part P. were not available to anyone

who would have tried to recognize recessions at the time they occurred. Part
B of the table is based on preliminary data that would have been available to

contemporary observers. Quarterly estimates of real GNP began to be published
regularly in 1959 and so for 1948-58 only the rates of change in current-

dollar GNP are used. Price changes were moderate in this period (except in
1950), and indeed the results are identical with those based on the present

data for real GNP (compare the first four lines, columns 5-8, in parts A and B

of the table). Preliminary data based on incomplete information often have
large extrapolative components and they share with forecasts the tendency to
underestimate actual change (Cole 1969; Zarnowitz 1982), but here the early
estimates produce results that are very close to those obtained with the last

revised estimates. The mean signal and recognition lags in part B are 0 and
+8, respectively, the same as in part A, while the standard deviations are
somewhat smaller.

To sum up, mere monitoring of the data on real GNP growth cannot produce

prompt recognition of recessions. The typical range of the delays involved in
the process is about 6—9 months, by 4hich time the recession itself may nearly

6

be over. (Business cycle contractions since 19148 ranged from 6 to 16 months

and averaged 11 months.) The length of the recognition lags is very little
affected by whether a recession is defined as two consecutive quarterly
declines in real GNP or as two quarters of growth below one percent. Also,
the conclusion that the lags tend to be long relative to the length of
recessions holds regardless of whether preliminary or revised data are used.

The events that must occur for the deficit cuts to be suspended are
exactly stipulated in GRH, but there appears to be nothing specific in the law

about the mechanism for ending a decreed suspension. Presumably, the deficit
reductions will resume when the legislators recognize that the conditions
which triggered the suspension no longer exist, but how promptly would this

happen in response to what signals? Suppose that the recognition that a
recession is over required two consecutive quarters of positive growth in real
GNP to follow each of the sequences listed in Table 1, column 14.

Then

substantial delays in recognizing a recovery would be likely; for the eight
business cycle troughs of 19149-82 such lags would have ranged from 5 to 10

months and averaged 8 months, using the present data. A better rule to follow
would be to assume that the recovery is on as soon as it is known that output
increased at an annual rate of more than one percent for a single quarter

after a period of a recognized recession. This criterion would have come
fairly close to most of the trough dates of recessions, reducing the average

recognition lag to 3 months. However, some false signals of troughs would
have resulted, as illustrated by the rise of real GM? in 1182 (see Table 1
notes h and 1.)

3. Forecasting Recessions
The meaning of the long recognition lags listed in Table 1 is that any

7

signals from the actual data on real GNP growth would have been much too tardy
for the purposes envisaged in the recession-related provisions of GRH.

If

Congress had to rely on such signals, it would be likely to suspend the

deficit cuts at best only late in a recession. By then the fiscal tightness
required by GRH would have already done its harm in contributing to the

business contraction. The suspension might still help in hastening the end of
the decline, but it could also be sufficiently mistimed to overstimulate the
economy during the following recovery and expansion.

Clearly, it is only timely and accurate forecasts of an approaching

recession that could provide the right warnings when needed. Studies have
repeatedly shown that combining predictions from diverse sources and methods

often results in significant gains in accuracy. That is, the consensus
forecasts from surveys are typically more accurate than most of the individual
forecasters polled (Zarnowitz 198Z), when accuracy is measured over a

considerable period of time. The record of such group averages in predicting
the major macroeconomic variables is often as good as or better than that of

the principal econometric forecasting models (McNees 1973, 1979). These
research findings are based on the median forecasts from the surveys conducted
quarterly since 1968 by the American Statistical Association (ASA) and NBER.
For this paper we shall use the consensus forecasts of' real GNP gro' th both

from the ASA—NBER quarterly survey and from the well-known Blue Chip Economic

Indicators monthly survey. The results should compare reasonably well with
what might be expected from the CBO and 0MB forecasts that are required under
the GRH law.

Fifteen of the quarterly ASA-MEER surveys since 1968 can be linked to

recessions as defined by GRH (Table 2). Six of these predicted that real GNP
would turn down and fall for at least two consecutive quarters during the year

8

ahead, while nine predicted that a decline shown by the preliminary data for
one or more previous quarters would continue for at least one more quarter.

Estimates of actual change are listed for two quarters (Q1, Q) preceding the
quarter Q1 in which the survey was taken (columns 4-6). The median survey
forecasts of real growth in the five successive quarters covered by each

survey (Q1-Q5) are shown next (columns 7-11). Signal leads or lags (column
1i) measure the intervals between the peak dates implied by the configurations

of the estimates and forecasts (column 12) and the business cycle peak dates

determined by MBER (column 1). Recognition leads or lags (column 15) measure
the intervals between the survey release dates (column 13) and the business
cycle peak dates.2

The first signals of peaks that did subsequently occur and the
corresponding recognition lags are included in the averages shown on the

bottom line. The other entries in the last two columns are put in parentheses
and excluded from the averages. Most of these are secondary signals that
merely confirm the initial ones, but in 1979 a recession was repeatedly
predicted that did not happen in that year and these signal and recognition

leads, marked F, are also excluded. It is important to note, however, that
these false warnings could not be readily recognized as such at the time and
might have been seriously misleading, although a brief recession did occur in
1980.

The forecasters as a group did not perform well in predicting the 1969—70
recession, according to the present criteria. In t'Iovember 1969 their average

forecast for 1V69 was -1.2% which correctly captured the timing of the peak,

2The survey questionnaire is mailed by the ASP. in the middle month of each
quarter to a list of persons who are professionally engaged in forecasting the
course of the economy. The replies are sent to and examined by the 'JBER, and
regular reports on the results are released in the third month.

but the predicted decline was to last one quarter only. In February 1970 no
further downward movement was anticipated. The May 1970 survey is the first
to qualify under the criterion of two consecutive quarterly declines. Hence
the recognition lag was 6 months, whereas the corresponding recognition lag in
Table 1 was 14 months.

The survey taken in February 19714 predicted negative growth rates for
both 1714 and 11714. Hence the forecast yields a lag of 14 months at the

business cycle peak of November 1973, much less than the recognition lag of 8

months based on preliminary actual data (Table 1 part B) Moreover,
according to the presently available revised data the recognition lag was 14

months

(Table 1, part A).

This brings up an important point. The GNP data are subject to long
series of revisions which are frequently large relative to the quarterly

changes. Compared with the "final" figures, the preliminary estimates of
growth in the nation's output are sometimes about as much in error as the

earlier forecasts of growth. In large part, the measurement errors involved
are occasioned by major benchmark revisions related to censuses taken at
intervals of several years or by changes in the base year of the constant

price estimates. Neither the forecasters nor the data compilers themselves
can be reasonably expected to predict such revisions. Since the final data
may not be known for years, they can hardly be of much help on a current basis
to economic analysts and forecasters.
During 1979, when economic activity ceased to grow after four years of'

expansion, many economists repeatedly predicted a downturn too soon. Thus the
surveys of February, May,

and august

1979 produced median forecasts of

declines that did not happen (F). But the same episode also produced the
earliest correct peak forecasts in the November 1979 survey as the long-

10

anticipated downturn materialized at the beginning of 1980. The signal and
recognition leads of 5 and 1 months, respectively, contrast with

of 1 and

9 months in Table
Finally, the downturn of July 1981 was not anticipated earlier that year,

although in May the forecasters as a group predicted zero growth for 1181 and

in August predicted zero growth for 11181. The first forecast of at least two
successive quarters of decline was issued in November and then showed negative

growth for three quarters, starting with 1181. The signal and recognition
lags for this recession are —5 and ÷5 months, respectively, which is still
much better than the corresponding lags of 1 and 9 months recorded in Table 1.
The overall averages in Table 2 are a signal lead of 4 months and a

recognition lag of 3 months. The corresponding measures yielded by the actual
data for the same period are mean lags of 1 and 9 months in Table 1A and of 2

and 8 months in Table lB. This suggests a significant gain from the
forecasts, which however is qualified by the false signals that on balance
weigh much more heavily against the forecasts than against the data.

The Blue Chip surveys, initiated in 1978, cover only the recessions of
1980 and 1981—1982, but they have the advantage of being monthly and hence

very up-to—date. The 27 surveys that produced average predictions of
recessions as defined by GRH are listed in Table 3, which follows the same
rules and has the same format as Table 2.

Although their sources as well as frequency are quite different, the two

sets of forecasts show similar patterns. In Table 3 again there is a sequence

3Recall that real GNP declined only in one quarter (1130) during the short
recession of Jan.—July 980 so that the 'less than 1% growth" rule must be
invoked in Table 1 to identify this particular peak. But the same rule, when
applied to the present revised data, vLeids in this case a read of 6 months!
(Table 1, part A). This is because these data show zero growth in 179 and a
slight decline in 1179.

11

of false signals of peaks in 1979 that ends in November when both surveys gave
the earliest correct warning of the January 1980 downturn (the recognition
lead is here slightly longer for Blue Chips because of faster processing).

Blue Chips then produced a somewhat longer sequence of' timely signals. Both
surveys erred in August-September 1980 in forecasting that the recession would

continue in the second half of the year. Blue Chips issued a correct
prediction of the July 1981 peak in August, i.e., with a lag of one month
only, whereas ASA-NBER did so in December, with a recognition lag of 5

months. For the two recessions of the early 1980s, the averages of the
earliest signals are -5 and 0 for Blue Chips and -5 and ÷2 for ASA-NBER.
Finally, let us note that neither group predicted any two-quarter
declines in real GNP since the end of the last recession in Iovember 1982.
This may be counted as a significant plus for the forecasters since the
slowdown from mid—198Z through 1985 was accompanied by severe difficulties in
several important economic sectors, much uncertainty, and large revisions of
the GNP data.

i4 Alternative Approaches
Table 4 compares the above results with some alternatives. Signals of
recession from reported data on real GNP growth under the GRH definition are
very tardy (column 2). The evidence from surveys of' forecasters looks
reasonably good, suggesting that some recessions can be predicted at about the

time of their occurrence or with short lags (columns 3 and 4). But this
result must be tempered by the recognition that (1) the time series of
forecasts cover few recessions and so are not very informative on this point;
(2) the variation of the leads and lags obtained is relatively large (see the
reported standard deviations); and (3) the forecasters produced some

12

potentially misleading false signals.

It is therefore of interest to consider also some other possible

approaches to signaling recessions, which could provide inputs into the

forecasts by the agencies involved in the GRH process. A few years ago, the
authors developed a system of recession and recovery signals based upon
smoothed rates of change in the government indexes of leading and coincident
indicators (Zarnowitz and Moore 1982; reprinted with an update in Moore 1983,
chapter 1!).

This

system produces sequentially, on a current monthly basis,

early warnings and confirmations of business cycle turning points. The first
signal of a peak (P1) is observed when the smoothed rate of growth in the
leading index falls below 2.3%, while the corresponding rate for the
coincident index is nonnegative (L <
by L <

-1.0,

2.3; C

0);

the second (P2) is defined

C < 2.3; and the third and last (P3) by L <

0, C < -1.0. The Fl

criterion results in very early signals which, however, turn out fairly often
to be false (F); P2 substantially reduces both the lead times and the
frequency of the F's; and P3 is associated with short or intermediate lags but

seems to eliminate the F's altogether. Table , column 5, lists the lags for
P3 and shows them to average 2 or 3 months. A particular advantage of this
approach is the low variability of the lags over time.

Each of the post-World War II business cycle downturns in the United
States was accompanied by increases in the overall unemployment rate of at

least 0.5% averaged over spans of six months. An index combining six selected
series published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics relating to marginal
employment adjustments (e.g., average work week, layoffs, initial unemployment
claims) is compiled monthly by the ColumbIa Center for International Business

Cycle Research (CIBCR). Smoothed rates of growth in this index produce
relatively accurate semiannual (January and July) forecasts of changes in the

13

average rate of unemployment over the ensuing six-month periods (Moore
1985). A by-product of these CIBCR projections is a set of signals of'

recessions reproduced in Table i4, column 6. Five of these are timely (—1 to
+3 months) and three are lags of 6-7 months; two forecasts, dated 7/56 and
1/67 gave false peak warnings. The averages are lags of 3_14 months.

The

unemployment criterion of recession has two advantages: the unemployment rate
is not subject to revision and it is a concept widely understood by the
public.

5. Summary
Our results lead to the following conclusions:

1. There are serious problems with the definition of recessions adopted in

the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. Business cycles are best identified by the
consensus of movements in the principal economic aggregates, as is done in
the widely used chronology maintained by the National Bureau of Economic

Research. Not all recessions are associated with, or well identified by,
real GNP either declining or growing less than 1% (SAAR) for two

consecutive quarters. GNP estimates are subject to long sequences of
revisions that are often large, which aggravates the situation.

2. The record of preliminary estimates of real GNP published by the Department
of Commerce shows that most recessions would have been at least half over
by the time they would be recognized by the criterion of slow growth
specified in the Grainin Rudman law. Hence the suspension of deficit cuts

according to this criterion may come too late to play an effective anti—
recession role.

3. Tests of the alternative criterion based upon forecasts of two successive
declines in real GNP, using records of consensus forecasts by economists,

yield more satisfactory results. Most recessions would have been recog—

14

nized just a few months after they began. Occasionally, however, premature or false warnings have occurred.

4. Leading indicators of aggregate economic activity can also assist the
makers and users of forecasts in reducing the length and variability of

the lags in recognizing recessions. Indicators that are specifically
designed to anticipate changes in employment and unemployment may provide
additional services of this type.

5. Although rLo criteria for recognizing recoveries from recessions are
specified in the Gramm—Rudman law, tests of two possible procedures show
that most recoveries could be identified shortly after they began.
