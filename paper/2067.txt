A Specification Test for Speculative Bubbles

ABSTRACT

The set of parameters needed to calculate the expected present discounted
value of a stream of dividends can be estimated in two ways. One may test for
speculative bubbles, or fads, by testing whether the two estimates are the
same. When the test is applied to some annual U.S. stock market data, the
data usually reject the null hypothesis of no bubbles.
The test is of general interest since it may be applied to a wide class of
linear rational expectations models.

I. Introducti
The seeming tendency for self-fulfilling rumors about potential stock price
fluctuations to result in actual stock price movements has long been noted by

economists. In a famous passage, Keynes, for example, described the stock market
as a certain type of beauty contest, in which judges try to guess the winner of
the contest: speculators devote their "intelligence

to anticipating what average

opinion expects average opinion to be" [1964, p.156]. In recent rational
expectations work, this possibility has been rigorously formalized and the
self-fulfilling rumors dubbed speculative bubbles [Blanchard and Watson, 1982;

Shiller, 1978; Taylor, 1977; Tirole, 1982, 1985]. Recent attempts to detect such
bubbles with formal statistical tests have, however, met with mixed success

[Blanchard and Watson, 1982; Diba and Grossman, 1984; Flood and Garber 1980;
Flood, Garber and Scott, 1984; Hamilton and Whiteman, 1984].
One possible reason for the inability of the empirical tests to detect the
bubbles so often described is that the tests have been few and not very powerful.
This paper develops and applies a test for speculative bubbles that (a)allows for
a wider class of bubbles than did Flood and Garber

[1980] and Flood, Garber and

Scott [1984]; (b)is specifically designed to test against the alternative that
bubbles are present, in contrast to the volatility tests of Shiller [1981a, 1981bJ
and Leroy and Porter [1981]; and (c)may be applied even if prices and dividends
are nonstationary, again in contrast to the volatility tests and to the tests in
Flood and Garber [1980] and Flood, Garber and Scott [1984].
The basic idea of the present paper's test is very simple, and was suggested

by the specification test of Hausman [1978]. The test compares two sets of
estimates of the parameters needed to calculate the expected present discounted
value (PDV) of a given stock's dividend

stream, with expectations conditional on

current and all past dividends, In a constant discount rate model, the two sets

are obtained as follows.

One set may be obtained simply by regressing the stock

restrictions, may be applied to this pair of

equations's coefficients to obtain a second set of estimates of the expected PDV
parameters.

should be the same, apart from sampling error.

But this equality of the two sets will not hold under the alternative
hypothesis suggested by, e.g.,

Blanchard and Watson [19821, that the stock price

equals the sum of two components: the price implied by the efficient markets

and a speculative bubble. In this case,

suitable set of dividends omits a relevant

because the coefficients in the regression of price on dividends are biased

upwards. As is explained in section II, this is precisely what would be expected

test is performed. Section ILl presents empirical results from a constant
discount rate model and then develops and

results. Some econometric and algebraic details are in an appendix available from

When dividends

can proceed essentially as just

described in case (a) above: estimate (1)' by instrLlnental variables; estimate

difference of Pt on a difference of dt.

See section lilA.) So the basic

difference from case (a) is that it is acknowledged that dt's ARIMA equation is
is simply a convenient way to forecast dividends, and not a statement about the
exogeneity of dividends.

It still remains to determine the order of the ARIMA process for dt. To
make the results of as general interest as possible, the empirical work does

not assne any particular structural model for dividends. The order of the
ARIMA process for dt is data rather than theoretically determined, in the
spirit of the usual Box—Jenkins [1970] analysis. Consistent with such an
approach, a variety of ARIMA specifications are tried, tO

[Kleidon, 1985). Since it is also possible to obtain a closed form expression

for EbiEdtjjHt when dt follows a lognormal random walk [Kleidon, 1985), the
empirical work (in section IIIC) briefly considers this specification as well.
(c)Suppose that the specification test described in case (b) indicate! that the

difference between the two sets of estimates of the parameters needed to
calculate EbiEdt+jlHt is I.mlikely to result solely from sampling error.

Clearly, this can happen tar many reasons, in addition to the presence of bubbles.

The possibility that a discrepancy between the two sets of parameter
estimates results from certain factors other than bubbles is handled in two

ways. In section hID, a model with time varying discount rates is linearized
as in Shiller [1981a).

It is shown that in such a model one can apply a somewhat

more complicated version of the test just described.

The second way that shortcomin, of the present value model are considered
is by applying diagnostic tests to the estimates of (1)'. The diagnostic tests

are chosen in light of two alternatives

The third comment is that this test has a substantial
advantage over the
tests undertaken in Flood and Garber [1980] and Flood, Garber and Scott [19841,

and that proposed in Sargent and Wallace [1984]. This is that the specification test does not require parametric specification of the bubble process.

bubble described in (6); a bubble as in (6) whose probability of continuing to

or GNP growth, or political events; and combinations of any and all such bubbles.

The fourth comment is that the specification test can be used to test for
bubbles in other infinite horizon linear

rational expectations models. The idea

is to compare two sets of estimates. One set is obtained from the dynamic programming, or equilibrium, solution to

The second set is obtained by applying the relevant

Hansen and Sargent [l981b] formulas to

estimates obtained from two types of

equations. The first is the model's Euler equations, or first—order conditions
(i.e., the model's analogue to equation (1)). The second is A.RIMA equations
for the model's forcing variables (i.e., the model's analogue to equation (lla)

or (lib) below). The null hypothesis of no bubbles should be rejected only if (a)
diagnostic tests on the Euler and ARINA equations suggest that these equations

It does not, however, seem wise to push either of these arguments too far.
One reason is the simple lognormal random walk specification may not adequately

capture the dynamics of the dt process. This figures in column (7) of Table

some residual serial correlation. A second reason is that the

figures in Table III do not really indicate a rejection of the model at the 99%

The regression of returns on dividends is reported in Table VA. In
contrast to the results of the previous section, some predictability of returns

is suggested. Y0, the coefficient on d

or

was significantly different

from zero at the 95 percent level. So, too, was the sum of the other dis-

tributed lag coefficients. See columns (3) and (4). The significance of
the coefficients is, however, probably somewhat overstated, since, as explained
above, some experimentation was done to obtain a specification with significant
coefficients.

Table VB has estimates of the dividend equations. These look quite
similar to those in Table lB. Table VC has estimates of the distributed lag
equations (18a) and (lSb). Note that the coefficients are woefully insignificant for differenced specifications.

Results of the test of the null hypothesis of no bubbles are reported in

Table VI. The null is strongly rejected for undifferenced specifications,

not at all for differenced specifications. The sum of the biases of the 6.
was positive for all specifications except differenced, lag length =

4.

It is rather disturbing that allowing for time varying discount rates
yields stronger evidence against the model for undifferenced specifica-

tions, weaker evidence for differenced specifications. One possible
explanation is that the equation (17) forecasts of future expected returns
are quite noisy, and very different from the market's actual expected returns.
The fitted values from equation (17a) could then be spuriously leading to a
rejection for undifferenced specification, or conversely, those from (l7b)

could be incorrectly suggesting little evidence against the model for dif—

ferenced specifications. A priority for future research, then, is performing
similar tests with a more tightly constrained parameterization of what

determines expected returns. The evidence in this section does little to pin down

—27—

the extent to which the rejectionsin the
constant discount rate model are
due to variations in discount rates.

relevant to the interpretation of the results of this paper.7 It is, of
course, of interest to further investigate whether, for the purposes of the
specification test, it is adequate as an approximation to consider only
variations in expected returns that are predictable from the past history of
dividends, and the extent to which such variations explain what seems to be

anomalous behavior in the data. This is an important task for future research.
What is required is a reconciliation of what appear to be incompatible

price and dividend data. The incompatibility is manifested in an upward bias
in the estimates of the coefficients of the projection of prices onto lagged

dividends. A reconciliation that involves a parametric model for bubbles, or
fads, and which allows for variation in expected returns, is a challenging
task for future research.
