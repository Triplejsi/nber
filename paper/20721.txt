A Taxonomy of Anomalies and their Trading Costs

NBER Working Paper No. 20721
December 2014
JEL No. G12,G14
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the performance of a large number of anomalies after accounting for transaction
costs, and the effectiveness of several transaction cost mitigation strategies. It finds that introducing
a buy/hold spread, which allows investors to continue to hold stocks that they would not actively trade
into, is the single most effective simple cost mitigation strategy. Most of the anomalies that we consider
with one-sided monthly turnover lower than 50% continue to generate statistically significant net spreads,
at least when designed to mitigate transaction costs. Few of the strategies with higher turnover do.
In all cases transaction costs reduce the strategies’ profitability and its associated statistical significance,
increasing concerns related to data snooping.

1. Introduction
This paper provides a taxonomy of the most important anomalies, and calculates the
cost of trading each strategy. It also studies several simple transaction cost mitigation
techniques, and shows that while transaction costs dramatically reduce the profitability of many anomalies, especially those with high turnover, designing strategies to
minimize transaction costs significantly reduces these costs. It also shows that equalweighted portfolio results, popular in the academic literature because they frequently
provide stronger results than value-weighted results, are misleading and should be
viewed skeptically. Because equal-weighted strategies are more expensive to trade,
equal-weighting often results in a deterioration of net performance.
Over the last 30 years academic researchers have documented hundreds of crosssectional “anomalies," a term which has come to mean size, value, momentum, and
any other strategy that generates a significant positive alpha relative to a four-factor
model that accounts for these first three. The incentives to find these strategies are
high both within academia (publications and tenure) and on the street (a marketable
story and a bigger paycheck). This raises significant data snooping concerns. Harvey
et al. (2014) argue on econometric grounds that three should be the new two for t-stats,
and conclude that “most claimed research findings in financial economics are likely
false.” This paper ignores transaction costs, however, meaning that even the spreads
reported in the literature often dramatically overstate the profitability of attempting
to trade these strategies.
McLean and Pontiff (2014) study the post-publication performance of 82 anomalies and find average post-publication performance decay of 35%. They attribute less
than a third of this decay to statistical bias, and the rest to price pressure by newly
aware investors, arguing that their results are “consistent with costly (limited) arbitrage,” because post-publication return declines are more pronounced for strategies
that disproportionately take positions in stocks that are easier to trade.
Limits to arbitrage are important for addressing questions related to market effi1

ciency. Market anomalies are often used as potential evidence against efficiency. We
generally believe that markets should be fairly efficient because of the forces of arbitrage, however, and these so called anomalies do not test market efficiency if they
should not attract arbitrage capital because they are not actually profitable to trade.
In this case they may indicate suboptimal behavior on the part of some individual
traders, but they are not suggestive of aggregate mispricing.
Several authors have studied the limits trading costs impose when implementing
momentum strategies. Lesmond et al. (2004) argue that while the large gross spreads
observed on momentum trades create an “illusion of profit opportunity when, in fact,
none exists.” Korajczyk and Sadka (2004) consider the price impact of trading momentum, and conclude that it would only be profitable to trade on a very small scale. These
papers do not, however, study momentum strategies designed to minimize transaction costs. More recently Frazzini et al. (2014) have argued that “actual trading costs
are less than a tenth as large as, and therefore the potential scale of these strategies is
more than an order of magnitude larger than, previous studies suggest," and conclude
that the strategy is “robust [and] implementable,” but their study is conducted using
proprietary data that covers a relatively short time-series, limited to larger stocks. No
studies provide a comprehensive analysis of the cost of trading more than a few of the
known anomalies, especially over longer horizons or using the entire cross-section of
stocks.
We consider a large array of well known anomalies, evaluating their after transaction cost performance over long horizons and across different types of stocks. In order
to do this we develop a new performance metric. This measure agrees with common
notions of alpha when trading is frictionless, but provides unambiguous information
about the extent to which an asset improves the investment opportunity set, something about which the common notion of alpha can be misleading in the presence of
trading frictions.
We also evaluate three simple strategies for reducing transaction costs: limiting

2

trading to low expected transaction costs stocks, reduced rebalancing frequencies, and
the use of a buy/hold spread that lowers turnover by introducing trading hysteresis.
We find that for most of the anomalies we consider the buy/hold spread is the most
effective cost mitigation technique, though for very high turnover strategies, for which
transaction cost mitigation is most important, a combination of all three techniques
yields greater performance enhancements.
Round trip transaction costs for typical value-weighted strategies average in excess of 50 bps, and though these have fallen over the last decade they can be significantly higher for strategies that take disproportionately in high transaction cost stocks
such as the anomalies based on idiosyncratic volatility or distress. Transaction costs
consequently generally reduce realized spreads by more than 1% of the monthly onesided turnover, i.e., if the long side of a strategy turns over 20% per month, the realized long/short spread will be at least 20 bps per month lower than the gross spread,
and the statistical significance of the spread will be reduced proportionately. Transaction costs for equal-weighted strategies are generally two to three times as high,
and often less profitable to actually implement. While many of the strategies that we
study remain significantly profitable after accounting for transaction costs, only two
of the strategies that have more than 50% one-sided monthly turnover have significant
net spreads, even when these strategies are designed with trading costs mitigation in
mind. In all cases transaction costs significantly reduce the anomalies profitability,
and its significance. This greatly increases concerns related to data snooping, as while
many of the strategies’ net excess returns remain significant at the t-stat greater than
two level, far fewer of the strategies generate net excess spreads with t-stats greater
than three.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our trading cost
model. Section 3 describes our generalized alpha performance metric. Section 4 provides our taxonomy of anomalies, and the cost of trading these. Section 5 considers
three simple techniques for transaction cost mitigation, and shows that these can sig-

3

nificantly reduce trading costs. Section 6 considers an alternative mitigation technique
available to an investor already trading one anomaly: using the turnover generated by
that strategy to opportunistically take small positions in another anomaly at negative
effective transaction costs. Section 7 investigates anomaly trading costs in different
segments of the market by capitalization. Section 8 concludes.

2. Trading Cost Model
When evaluating anomaly performance we calculate transactions costs using the effective bid-ask spread measure proposed by Hasbrouck (2009). These costs are estimated using a Bayesian Gibbs sampler on a generalized Roll (1984) model of stock
price dynamics. Roll’s model can be formally defined as:
Vt = Vt−1 + ε t
Pt = Vt + cQt
where Vt is the underlying “efficient value” (the log quote midpoint prevailing prior
to trade t), Pt is the observed trade price, Qt is a random indicator for the direction of
the trade that takes the value one (minus one) if the trade took place at the ask (bid),
ε t is a random disturbance reflecting public information about the stock, and c is the
effective cost of trading. The previous equations imply that
∆Pt = c∆Qt + ε t ,
which yields c =

p

−Cov(∆Pt , ∆Pt+1 ). Earlier empirical studies used the sample au-

tocovariances of daily price changes to estimate transactions costs but, as noted by
Hasbrouck (2009) and discussed in detail by Harris (1990), such an estimation is infeasible due to the relatively high proportion of positive autocoviarances between daily
changes in stock prices in the data. Hasbrouck (2009) instead advocates a Bayesian
4

approach to estimating the cost measure. He generalizes the previous equation to
include a market return factor,
∆Pt = c∆Qt + β m rmt + ε t ,
and assumes ε t ∼ i.i.d.N (0, σε2 ). Then, given the history of price data and additional
assumptions about initial values and prior distributions for the unknowns {c, σε2 , Q1 , ...,
Q T }, he draws sequentially the parameter estimates using a Gibbs sampler to characterize the posterior densities. Hasbrouck (2009) shows that effective spreads estimated
using this procedure have a 96.5% correlation with the ones estimated from actual
trades from the trade and quote (TAQ) dataset.
The effective bid/ask spread has limitations. It does not account for the price impact of large trades, and should thus be interpreted as the costs faced by a small liquidity demander. While it ignores this important concern for large institutional traders it
is nevertheless conservative, because it assumes market orders. It is also the appropriate measure for questions related to market efficiency, which depend on the marginal
profitability of a strategy for an arbitrageur considering directing capital to the trade.
This measure has other significant advantages. It is easy to estimate for all stocks
over the entire sample using publicly available information.1 This contrasts with estimates from the TAQ data or proprietary trade execution datasets, which are limited
in their coverage, difficult to extrapolate due to the nonlinear and time varying nature
of transaction costs, and harder to obtain.2
Figure 1 shows cross-sectional and time-series variation in trading costs, by looking at the estimated median effective spreads of the largest 2,000 firms by decade. Not
surprisingly it shows that smaller cap stock are more expensive to trade. It also shows

a general trend towards lower costs over time, and a dramatic reduction in the cost of
trading stocks outside the mega-cap universe over the last decade.
Table 1 examines the transaction cost estimates in greater detail. It reports FamaMacBeth cross-sectional regressions of the trading costs estimates on firm characteristics. We can see that the trading costs are persistent and significantly positively associated with idiosyncratic volatility. As expected, size is strongly negatively correlated
with transaction costs in the cross section, but the effect is non-linear. The coefficient
on the squared market cap variable is positive and significant, implying a convex relation between trading costs and size. More generally, nonlinearities make it difficult
to parametrically estimate costs accurately using directly observable firm characteristics. Table 14 in Appendix A.2 highlights the danger of extrapolating transaction costs
estimated on large, relatively liquid stocks to small stocks using a linear model. It
reports results from similar regressions performed on firms with above (panel A) and
below (panel B) NYSE median market capitalization, and shows dissimilar parameter
estimates for the two groups.
The Bayesian/Gibbs estimation technique requires relatively long strings of re-

The table reports results from Fama-MacBeth regressions of trading cost estimates on lagged trading
costs, market capitalization, and idiosyncratic volatility. The trading costs consist of the effective bidask spread measure proposed by Hasbrouck (2009). Idiosyncratic volatility is measured as the standard
deviation of residuals of past three months’ daily returns on the daily excess market return. Both market
capitalization and idiosyncratic volatility use end of July values. The regressions are estimated on an
annual frequency and cover 1963 through 2013.

ported daily returns, which results, especially in the early part of our sample, in a
substantial number of missing monthly and annual observations, the rebalance frequency for most of the trading strategies we consider. We are interested in the cost of
trading anomalies, and cannot know ex ante at the time of portfolio formation if the
trading cost estimate for any given stock will be missing ex post, and thus cannot limit
our trading to stocks for which the direct estimates of trading costs are available. We
consequently need a method for estimating trading costs when the direct estimates
from the Baysian-Gibbs sampler is unavailable. Because of the the difficulties associated with fitting transaction costs to a linear model observed in Table 1, we use a
non-parametric matching method. The high observed cross sectional correlations between transaction costs and size and idiosyncratic volatility lead us to match on these
characteristics. Specifically, in each month we rank all firms on market equity and
estimated idiosyncratic volatility. Each missing transaction cost observation is then
replaced with the estimated cost of trading the nearest match stock for which a direct
trading cost estimate is available. The closest match is defined by the shortest Euclidean distance in size and idiosyncratic volatility rank space, i.e., where the distance
q

between firms i and j equals
rankMEi − rankME j + rankIVOLi − rankIVOL j .
This methodology adds a time series average of 29% to the total number of observations, though these additional observations account on average for less than 4% of
market capitalization.
Figure 2 shows the estimated monthly 12-month moving average cost of trading momentum and post earnings announcement drift (PEAD) strategies, using directly estimated transaction costs (solid lines) and transaction costs estimates obtained
through the matching procedure (dashed lines), on the sample for which we have direct trading costs estimates.3 Strategies are long and short the highest and lowest
deciles, using NYSE breaks, of sorts on stock market performance over the first eleven

These strategies are not actually implementable, as the direct trading cost estimates require data
that are not available at the time of portfolio formation. We restricted the sample here to stocks for
which we have direct trading costs estimates in order to facilitate the comparison of the estimates
obtained through the matching procedure to those estimated directly.

months of the year prior to portfolio formation (momentum) and the change in earnings per share between the last quarterly earnings announcement and the the earnings
announcement one year earlier, scaled by the standard deviation in earnings per share
over the last eight quarters (PEAD).
The figure shows that the matching procedure yields similar costs of trading momentum and PEAD as the direct estimates, with no obvious biases in either direction.
Both strategies show similar time-series variation in trading costs using estimates obtained through the two different procedures, and in both cases the difference in the
estimated monthly transaction costs averages less than one basis point per month. For
the remainder of the paper we consequently use the trading costs estimates obtained
through the matching procedure to fill the 4% of market capitalization for which we
are missing direct estimates.

3. Performance evaluation
We are interested in whether anomalies documented in the literature are “real,” both
in the sense that they generate significant excess returns after accounting for transaction costs, and that they are distinct from the most studied anomalies, value and
momentum. Indeed, anomalies other than value or momentum are essentially defined as those strategies that have generated significant abnormal returns relative to
the Fama-French four-factor model.
In the presence of transaction costs evaluating performance against the standard
four-factor model is complicated by two issues. First, the Fama-French factors are
gross factors, i.e., do not themselves account for transactions costs. They consequently
overstate the returns an investor could have realized, especially in the case of the
momentum factor UMD.
The second issue is more subtle, and related to the very notion of performance
evaluation. Evaluating anomaly performance against the four-factor pricing model

requires a metric of performance. The metric most commonly employed is “alpha,”
an asset’s abnormal returns relative to a set of potential explanatory assets. Alpha
is defined as the average return to the part of a test strategy not spanned by the explanatory assets, i.e., the average active return benchmarked against the replicating
portfolio of explanatory assets. Alpha, and in particular its significance, is important
because it answers, at least in a frictionless world, the question “would the test asset have improved the investment opportunity set of an investor already trading the
explanatory assets?”
In the presence of trading costs, however, alpha does not unambiguously answer
this question. A strategy can have a significant positive alpha relative to the explanatory assets without significantly improving the investment opportunity set. This is
most easily seen by example. Suppose an investor has access to a strategy that generates insignificant excess returns. Now suppose the investor gains access to a new
highly correlated strategy that generates slightly higher returns. This new strategy
itself generates insignificant excess returns, but will nevertheless have a highly significant alpha relative to the original set strategy. In fact, in a frictionless world the
introduction of this asset could theoretically improve the Sharpe ratio available to the
investor by a factor of ten, or a hundred–a long position in the higher return asset
hedged with a short position in the highly correlated lower return asset could have an
extremely high Sharpe ratio. In the real world, however, the introduction of this asset
may hardly improve the investment opportunity set. Trading costs can easily exceed
the small spread generated by pairs trading the two assets, in which case the investor
would just switch out of the old strategy into the new, with essentially no impact on
the available Sharpe ratio.
These issues are important here. We are evaluating anomaly performance explicitly accounting for the cost of trading, and many of the anomalies we consider have
high correlations with the explanatory factors we employ, particularly with HML and
UMD, the Fama and French (1993) value factor and their version of the Carhart (1997)

11

momentum factor. We consequently prefer a generalized notion of alpha, which both
agrees with the common notion of alpha when trading is frictionless and unambiguously answers the question “does the test asset improve the investment opportunity
set of an investor with access to the explanatory assets?”

3.1. Factor trading costs
Figure 3 shows the estimated 12-month moving average cost of trading the Fama/French
size, value and momentum factors (SMB, HML and UMD, respectively) each month,
over the period spanning July 1963 through December 2013. SMB and HML incur
similar trading costs, because they are constructed using the same two-way cut on
size (NYSE median market capitalization) and three-way cut on book-to-market (30
and 70 percentiles using NYSE break points). These factors’ underlying portfolios are
only rebalanced annually, and both size and book-to-market are fairly persistent, so
turnover is fairly low and transaction costs are modest. Over the sample SMB and
HML on average only turn over 2.32% and 1.99% and per year. The time-series average cost of trading these factors is 5.66 and 5.45 basis points per month, and the
12-month moving averages are constant over one year periods because the strategies
are only rebalanced annually. UMD, which is constructed using the same two-way
cut on size and a tertile sort of stock performance over the first eleven months of the
prior year, is rebalanced monthly and incurs much higher transaction costs. Over the
sample UMD turns over 24.64% per year, and its time-series average cost of trading is
48.39 basis points per month. The figure shows the Sharpe downward trend in trading
costs after 2000, and spikes in trading cost over periods of market stress (e.g., OPEC
oil crisis in 1973, Nasdaq deflation in 2001, and the great recession in 2008).

Figure 3: Transactions Costs for Fama-French Factors over Time
The figure reports the estimated 12-month moving average cost of trading the Fama and French (1993)
size, value and momentum factors (SMB, HML and UMD, respectively) each month, over the period
spanning July 1963 through December 2013.

3.2. Performance metric: a generalized alpha
Our generalized notion of alpha is simplified by letting y ⊥ X ≡ y − X ( X 0 X )−1 X 0 y denote the part of the test asset y not spanned by the explanatory assets X, MVEX denote
the ex post mean variance efficient portfolio of the assets X, wy,MVE{X,y} be the weight
on y in MVE{X,y} , and temporarily ignoring transaction costs. Then MVE{X,y⊥X } =
MVE{X,y} , so
MVE{X,y} ⊥ MVEX = MVE{X,y⊥X } ⊥ MVEX

= MVE{X,y⊥X } ⊥ X
= MVE{X,y} ⊥ X
= wy,MVE{X,y} y ⊥ X.
The first and third equalities follow from the equivalence of MVE{X,y} and MVE{X,y⊥X } .
The second equality holds because MVE{X,y⊥X } is a convex combination of MVEX and

13

y ⊥ X, and X spans MVEX while y ⊥ X is orthogonal to X.
Dividing by wy,MVE{X,y} and taking the average yields our generalized notion of α,
−1
α∗ ≡ wy,MVE

{ X,y}

MVE{X,y} ⊥ MVEX .

(1)

When trading is frictionless this reduces to the common definition of α, the average
return to the part of the test strategy not spanned by the explanatory strategy. More
generally α∗ can be interpreted as the average return to the highest Sharpe ratio portfolio of the test asset and the explanatory assets that has a one dollar position in the
test asset, beta adjusted for the highest Sharpe ratio portfolio of the explanatory assets.
It thus provides information about how much better the investor can do with access to
the test strategy, and thus about how the test asset improves the investment opportunity frontier. This interpretation is valid even when trading is costly. Our generalized
notion of alpha can yield substantially different inferences than the common notion,
particularly when the test asset would not be held either long or short in the MVE
portfolio, or when access to the test asset pushes one or more of the explanatory assets
out of the MVE portfolio.4
4

The notion employed here is closely related to, but distinct from, that proposed by Grinblatt and
Titman (1989) and employed by Hanna and Ready (2005) to evaluate the stock selection strategy proposed by Haugen and Baker (1996). These authors evaluate performance using the average return to
the part of the test asset itself that is not spanned by the MVE portfolio of the explanatory assets. To see
the relation between this notion and ours, let y|| X ≡ X ( X 0 X )−1 X 0 y denote the part of y spanned by X.
Then y = y ⊥ X + y|| X, so
y ⊥ MVEX

= y ⊥ X + (y|| X ) ⊥ MVEX ,

where we have used the fact that the part of y that is orthogonal to X is orthogonal to the MVE portfolio
of X. The part of y not spanned by the MVE portfolio of X thus differs from the part of y not spanned
by X by the part of the projection of y onto X not spanned by the MVE portfolio of X, a mean-zero
series uncorrelated with y ⊥ X. This metric, the test asset’s average returns not explained by the MVE
portfolio of the explanatory assets, thus provides the same alpha estimate as the common methodology.
This notion of alpha can again however yield misleading inferences regarding whether the test asset
improves the investment opportunity set when the test asset would not be held either long or short in
the MVE portfolio, or when access to the test asset pushes one or more of the explanatory assets out of
the MVE portfolio.

4. Simple Strategies
Equipped with our transactions costs measures and a generalized notion of alpha,
we next study the behavior of popular asset pricing anomalies accounting for costs
of trading. Our first goal is to establish a taxonomy of anomalies in the cross-section
of expected stock returns. Focusing on the economics of the underlying problems,
researchers often compare the behavior of strategies whose implementability differs
substantially. For example, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) study momentum and shortterm reversal portfolios rebalanced each month. Fama and French (1993), on the other
hand, look at size and value portfolios that are only rebalanced annually. Clearly, size
and value are much cheaper to trade. Moreover, even though both momentum and
reversals are rebalanced monthly, prior year’s performance is far more persistent than
prior month’s performance, resulting in turnover on the short-term reversal strategy
almost three times as high as on momentum.
Table 2 reports the twenty-three anomalies that we examine. In our taxonomy we
group trading strategies into three groups, low-, mid-, and high-turnover strategies,
corresponding roughly to strategies where each the long and short side on average
turnover less than once per year, between one and five times per year, and more than
five times per year, respectively. The table includes references to the studies that first
document them, brief descriptions of the sorting variable used, the frequency of rebalancing, and the starting year. For additional details on the construction of the signals,
see Appendix A.1.

4.1. Basic strategies
Table 3 reports time-series regression results for the twenty-three strategies, constructed
using the simple decile sorting procedure popular in the academic literature, split into
the three bins, low- (Panel A), mid- (Panel B), and high- (Panel C) turnover. In each
panel we report the gross average monthly returns of the strategy (column 1), these
returns four-factor alpha (column 2), monthly average turnover of each side of the
strategy (column 3) and transactions costs (column 4), net return (column 5), and the
generalized alpha described in subsection 3.2 of the net returns relative to the four
factors (column 6).
The cost of trading the low turnover strategies is generally quite low, often less
than 10 bp per month, primarily because all of them are constructed using annual
rebalancing. Because transactions costs generally represent a small fraction of these
17

strategies’ gross spreads, we focus on the mid- and high-turnover strategies when we
consider transaction cost mitigation techniques.
The mid-turnover strategies on the other hand exhibit sizable transactions costs.
These are all rebalanced monthly, and have average turnover on each of the long and
the short side of between 14% and 35% per month. Trading costs average between
20 bp and 57 bp per month, often exceeding half the strategies’ gross spreads. In
fact, only the net issuance, earnings momentum strategy based on cumulative abnormal three day return around the prior earnings announcement, and momentum
and its derivative anomalies, achieve net excess returns that are statistically significantly larger than zero. The best performing strategy is the one sorted on the basis of
Table 3: Value-weighted returns
This table presents results for returns on value-weighted long/short self-financing portfolios, constructed using a decile sort on a signal using NYSE breakpoints. Panel A presents results for low
turnover strategies, panel B reports the results for mid-turnover strategies, while panel C focuses on
the high-turnover strategies. In each panel, the strategies’ gross excess return, alpha relative to the fourfactor model, average turnover (average over the long and short side), transactions costs, net returns,
and the net four-factor alpha are presented. See table 2 and/or Appendix A.1 for further details on the

the combined value, momentum and gross profitability signals. Including the profitability considerations almost doubles the net spread relative to the strategy based on
value and momentum signals alone, from 51 to 99 bp per month, with a t-stat of 5.18.
19

Other popular anomalies including idiosyncratic volatility and the strategy based on
predicted failure probability, are only marginally profitable after accounting for transaction costs. With the exception of ValMom, however, all these strategies do have
significant generalized alphas relative to the four factor model.
The cost of trading the high-turnover strategies, at least when designed with complete disregard for trading costs, always exceeds 1% per month. Transactions costs
significantly exceed the gross spread for all but two of the anomalies we examine,
with only the High-frequency Combo and the Low Volatility Industry Relative Reversals strategies achieving positive net excess returns. Given that accounting for the effective bid-ask spread alone eradicates the profits from all but two of these strategies,
we contend that there are significant barriers to arbitrage among the high-turnover
strategies.
Table 4 shows the ex-post mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio weights and
the maximum attainable Sharpe ratios, accounting for transaction costs, using the
Fama and French factors and each of the twenty-three anomalies. All of the lowturnover anomalies except for size, and all of the mid-turnover strategies except for
ValMom, seem to improve the mean-variance frontier. Only the High-frequency combo
and the Low Volatility Industry Relative Reversals get positive weights in the MVE
from the high-turnover anomalies and improve the maximum Sharpe ratio by one
percentage point to 0.76.

5. Transaction Cost Mitigation
The strategies presented in the previous section, constructed using the the high-minuslow decile sort most commonly employed in academic studies, significantly overstate
the actual cost of trading these anomalies for at least two reasons. First, even though
the effective bid-ask spread measure we use does not account for price impact it assumes market orders for all trades and it does nothing to reduce transactions costs. In
practice large institutional investment managers devote entire departments to the sole
purpose of reducing the costs of executing trades.
Even more importantly, the strategies were designed ignoring trading costs, and
thus generate far more trading and far higher transaction costs than necessary. In
this section we propose three simple, rule-based methodologies designed to reduce
trading costs. The first of these simply limits trading to the universe of stocks that
we expect to be relatively cheap to trade. The other two use strategies that attempt
to significantly reduce turnover without significantly reducing exposure to the underlying anomaly. The first of these turnover reduction techniques, staggered partial
rebalancing, is considered by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), though for the purpose
of identifying the horizon over which momentum generates the highest gross returns,
not as a method for reducing transaction costs. The second of these turnover reduction
techniques, the use of a buy-hold spread (i.e., a willingness to hold positions that you
would not actively trade into), is largely absent from the academic literature though
frequently employed in practice (e.g., Dimensional Fund Advisors employ this strategy in small cap funds, and MSCI has several indices that use it).
We are primarily interested in whether anomalies are real, in the sense that they
are attractive to trade in the real world after accounting for transaction costs, and that
they are distinct from the best known anomalies, especially value and momentum. In
order to determine whether an anomaly truly improves the investment opportunity
set of an investor with access to the four factors employed in our asset pricing model,
we need to use factors that do not themselves incur unreasonably large trading costs.
22

In particular, the anomalies should be evaluated relative to a momentum factor that is
constructed using transaction cost mitigation techniques to create a fair playing field.
Table 5 reports the performance of UMD-like factors, constructed using each of the
three trading-cost mitigation techniques. The table reports gross returns, transactions
costs, net returns and results from a net-on-net Fama-French four factor model regression.
The table shows that while all three factors generate significant net-on-net four factor alphas, the momentum strategy constructed using a spread between the buy and
hold thresholds, has the largest and most significant net alpha relative to the standard four factor model that accounts for transaction costs. This momentum factor is
also outside the span of the other two. The ex post mean-variance efficient portfolios,
accounting for transaction costs, of the three momentum factors, or the three momentum factors and the three Fama-French factors, put no weight on the momentum factors constructed in the low cost universe and with staggered quarterly rebalancing.
The three Fama-French factors and UMD together explain 87.3%, 95.3% and 94.8%
of the variation in the three factors. Figure 4 further examines the transactions costs
associated with the three momentum factors over time. We can observe that all four
factors’ trading costs seem to move together, but the level of the ones constructed with
trading hysteresis and staggered rebalancing are lower. We will consequently employ
the momentum factor constructed using trading hysteresis when evaluating anomaly
performance.

5.1. Strategies Formed in the Low Cost Universe
The first transactions cost mitigation technique we examine is limiting the universe
of stocks to low trading cost stocks. To this end, we use only stocks that are in the
low lagged trading cost tertile of each NYSE size decile. Since the effective spread
measure is fairly persistent, this procedure helps us identify the low-cost universe
without having a look-ahead bias. The conditional double sort is used to avoid a

Surprisingly this procedure does not significantly reduce the trading costs for any
of the mid-turnover strategies. The average turnover and trading costs are similar to
the ones for the strategies, which can be most easily seen in the last column. Only
FF4+
the PEAD (CAR3) anomaly has a positive and statistically significant αnet
, and this

comes primarily from an increased gross spread, not a reduction in the cost of trading
the strategy. Restricting the universe to the low trading cost does not add much over
using the traditional decile sort on the entire universe for the mid-turnover anomalies.
For the high-turnover strategies, however, there seems to be a marked reduction
in trading costs. While there is not much of a reduction in turnover, the trading costs
for this lot decrease by 25% on average. The performances of the High-frequency
Combo and the IRR (Low Volatility) benefit the most, as evidenced by the positive
and significant net returns and net four-factor alphas.

26

5.2. Strategies Formed Using Staggered Partial Rebalancing
The second cost mitigation technique we examine is staggered partial rebalancing.
This technique reduces turnover by simply lowering the frequency at which a strategy is traded, at the expense of some staleness in the signals on which the strategies
are based. The technique is popular among large institutional money-managers. For
example, Applied Quantitative Research’s (AQR) momentum indices, which are designed to track the Momentum strategy with limited trading costs, are rebalanced
quarterly.5 We consider mid-turnover strategies here similarly rebalanced quarterly.
For the high-frequency strategies, which are sorted on signals that are much less persistent, rebalancing quarterly is too infrequent to maintain a large average exposure
to the underlying anomaly. We consequently run these strategies twice as fast, with
staggered rebalancing at a half-quarterly frequency.
The table shows that a two-thirds reduction in trading frequency generally yields
roughly only a one-third reductions in turnover and transaction cost, as more of the
portfolio turns over at each rebalance point. For the mid-turnover strategies these
cost reductions generally come at the expense of only marginal reductions in the
net spreads, however, resulting in significant generalized net alphas relative to the
four Fama and French factors and the corresponding simple strategies. The highfrequency strategies, and the highest turnover mid-turnover strategies (the fundamental momentum strategies), see similar proportional trading cost reductions, but
suffer larger deterioration in the gross spreads, yielding more modest improvements
to these strategies realized performance.

5.3. Strategies Formed Using a Buy/Hold Spread
The last cost mitigation technique we consider is trading with a buy/hold spread.
These strategies follow an sS rule, under which a trader will hold (maintain short
positions on) stocks that they own (are short) provided that the sorting variable is in
the extreme s%, but will only actively buy (short) a stock that they have no position in
when it enters the most extreme S%.6 For example, a 10%/20% buy/hold rule implies
that we only buy (sell short) stocks when they get into the top (bottom) 10%, and hold
them by restricting sales (short covers) only for stocks that leave the top (bottom) 20%.
The sS strategies present an easy to implement, rule-based methodology, which
doesn’t depend on an explicit model for transactions costs or expected returns, such
as the one employed in Frazzini et al. (2014). It provides exposure to the sources of
excess returns without incurring the high turnover inherent in the traditional decile
sorted portfolios. The procedure dramatically reduces turnover by holding (not selling) close substitutes to the stocks you would have bought, since there is not much of
a difference in expected returns between stocks in the 75-80% range of the distribution
of a given return predictor and those in the 80-85% range.
Figure 5 examines sS momentum strategies in further detail. Panel (a) plots the
buy and hold thresholds that yield strategies that hold roughly the same number of
names as the standard decile sort, as a function of the difference between the long and
the short thresholds, i.e. the sS spread. Panels (b) to (f) show that as spread increases
6

The term follows Arrow et al. (1951). This paper develops the sS inventory control model, and
includes an inaction region when the level of inventory is between s (the lower threshold) and S (the
higher threshold). The basic idea is that, in order to minimize the cost of storage and order handling, a
firm needs to rebalance its inventory back to S only when it drops below the lower threshold, s. See also
Davis and Norman (1990), which introduces proportional transactions costs in a simple continuoustime model of optimal consumption and investment with one risky stock and one money market and
find that the optimal policy consists of an inaction region and a return to the closer boundary when rebalancing, and, Abel and Eberly (1996), which studies optimal investment with costly reversibility and
show that there is an inaction region for investment/disinvestment when there is a wedge between the
purchase and sale prices of capital. Abel and Eberly (1996) also shows that even tiny transaction costs
lead to non-trivial inaction regions. Specifically, they show that the size of this region is proportional
to the cube-root of the price wedge for small wedges, which makes its derivative with respect to the
wedge infinite.

The figure plots various sS Momentum strategy results as a function of the sS spread. Panel (a) plots

turnover and the average number of firms over the long and short sides of the strategy, panel (e) plots
the gross and net returns as well as the trading costs associated with the strategy, and panel (f) plots

the past performance spread between the winners and losers portfolio narrows, but
that the turnover and transactions costs reduction is even more dramatic, resulting in
increasing net spreads and Sharpe ratios.
Table 8 presents results sS strategies for all the mid- and high-frequency strategies.
Panel A looks at 10%/20% mid-turnover strategies, while panel B examines 10%/50%
high-turnover strategies. In each panel, we report the strategies’ gross excess return,
gross alpha relative to the four-factor model, average turnover (average over the long
and short side), transactions costs, net returns, net four-factor alpha, and the net alpha relative to the four factors and the respective simple strategy from table 3. The
sS strategies exhibit slightly lower gross returns but much lower turnover and transactions costs as opposed to their simple counterparts. The average reduction in the
turnover for the twenty-three anomalies is 41%, while the transactions costs decrease
by 42%. Net returns are consequently higher. The clear winner is the ValMomProf
again, with an average monthly return of 1.02%, with a t-stat of 6.19. virtually all of
the mid-turnover anomalies also have significant positive generalized net four-factor
alphas. Moreover, the sS strategies seem to add to the investment possibilities even
after the basic equivalents of the strategies are included in the investment opportunity
set, as evidenced by the last column.
There is an improvement in the performance of the high-frequency strategies as
well, and the High-frequency Combo and the Low Volatility Industry relative Reversals have positive and statistically significant net returns, and marginally significant
net-on-net four and five factor alphas.

the four-factor model, average turnover (average over the long and short side), transactions costs, net

5.4. Cost Mitigation Technique Comparison
Next, we compare the performance of the three trading cost mitigation techniques.
Table 9 reports ex-post mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio weights on the net
returns to the Fama/French factors and each of the twenty-three anomalies, mitigated
using the three mitigation techniques separately. Panel A presents results for basic,
non-mitigated low turnover strategies, while panels B and C add to the four factors
the mid- and high-turnover strategies, mitigated in three different ways discussed
above. For each anomaly, the weights in the tangency portfolio are reported as well as
the maximum attainable Sharpe Ratio.
Here, we also use the sS UMD factor, as opposed to the traditional one to better
judge the improvement in the investment opportunity set by each strategy. Thus,
the maximum attainable Sharpe ratio from the four factors alone is 0.90, which is
significantly higher than the 0.75 in table 4 using the regular UMD factor, which is
more expensive to trade. The low-turnover strategies used are the basic ones, since
turnover for these is low enough that applying the mitigation techniques reduces exposure to the underlying anomaly without significantly reducing trading costs. All
the low turnover strategies, with the exception of size and value which are redundant
to the Fama and French factors, improve the investment opportunity set.
The more interesting results, however, are with regards to the mid- and highturnover strategies. All of the mid-turnover strategies, with the exception of ValMom,
benefit from trading cost mitigation. The maximum attainable Sharpe ratio for the ValMomProf strategy increases to 1.15, by putting weight on all three mitigated strategies.
It is also worth emphasizing that the most weight out of the three types of mitigated
strategies seems to be put on the sS ones, suggesting that it is the most useful single
simple method for reducing turnover while preserving exposure to the underlying
signal. Not surprisingly, the maximum attainable Sharpe ratio is improved on for the
High-frequency Combo and the IRR (Low Volatility) out of the high-turnover strategies. For both of them, no weight is put in the tangency portfolio on the staggered
33

rebalanced strategies.

5.5. Strategies that Employ Multiple Cost Mitigation Techniques
While the buy/hold spread seemed to be the single most useful cost mitigation technique for most of the strategies we consider, the other techniques often contribute to
marginal performance improvements, and sometimes to significant ones. It is thus
natural to ask if these separate improvements can be realized simultaneously using
multi-mitigated strategies, which employ all three mitigation techniques simultaneously. The strategies are constructed in the lower lagged trading cost half of each
NYSE size decile, using staggered partial rebalancing, with turnover further reduced
using a buy hold spread.
Table 10 reports the strategies’ gross excess return, gross alpha relative to the fourfactor model, average turnover (average over the long and short side), transactions
costs, net returns, net four-factor alpha, and the net alpha relative to the four factors and the respective simple strategy from table 3. There is a dramatic decrease in
turnover (60% on average) and in transactions costs (59% on average) compared to
the basic strategies, which is partially offset by decrease in the exposure to signal evidenced by the gross returns. While these strategies do see improved performance
relative to the basic strategies, they generally do not improve on the single mitigation
technique of the buy/hold spread.
The benefit of multiple mitigation techniques is much greater, however, for the
high turnover strategies. This is not surprising, as reducing transaction costs is much
more important for the net performance of high transaction cost strategies. The net
returns to the High-Frequency Combo and the IRR (Low Volatility) have impressive
t-statistics of 5.23 and 4.12, resulting in net Sharpe ratios of 0.74 and 0.58, respectively.
Further, even the simple IRR strategy seems to have a positive net four-factor alpha,
albeit not statically significant.

6. Alternative Cost Mitigation Strategies
Next, we focus on an alternative cost mitigation technique that allows investors trading one strategy to opportunistically take small positions in another at effectively negative trading costs. We call this technique trading one strategy on the margin of another, but it is also known in the industry as screens or filters. To examine its effectiveness, we look at how trading Momentum and PEAD on the margin of Size improves
performance of the regular Size strategy and how trading the high-frequency combo
on the margin of momentum and sS momentum improves the performance of the two
momentum strategies.
Table 11 documents results of trading the two mid-turnover strategies on the margin of size. Panel A looks at size screened by momentum, while panel B looks at
size screened by PEAD. The screened strategies are enhanced by slowing sales (purchases) and short covers (shorts) when the screening variable is in the top (bottom)
x%, where x is indicated by the first column. The third column shows each strategy’s turnover in percentages, the fourth one indicates its net excess return over the
risk-free rate. The fifth one presents the generalized four factor net α. Finally, the
last three columns report the coefficients from the following spanning regression:

for panel B.
We can observe that in both cases, as the screen decile cutoff is increased, the
turnover decreases and the net returns t-stats increase. The loadings in the last three
columns demonstrate the extent to which the exposure to the screening strategy increases. Naturally, the loadings on the size strategy decrease while the loadings on
the sS momentum in panel A and sS PEAD in panel B increase. Interestingly, trading
momentum on the margin of size does not seem to add much if an investor is already
trading size and sS momentum, as evidence by the insignificant alphas in column 5.
On the other hand, trading PEAD on the margin of size seems to improve the investment opportunity set, as evidenced by the significant alphas in column 5 of panel B.
38

What this results implies is that, using this technique, an investor could take a small
position in PEAD on top of the size exposure at effectively negative transactions costs.
Similarly, table 12 shows that trading the high-frequency combo on the margin of
momentum (panel A) or sS momentum (panel B) also decreases turnover (up to 28%
for the 50% momentum screen) and improves the net returns. The spanning regression
results in the last three columns of panel B reveal that the sS momentum enhanced
high-frequency combo is worth trading even if an investor already has positions in
both strategies separately, simply because we are saving the trading costs associated
with rebalancing against the high-frequency combo. We can see a similar result in
panel A for the basic momentum enhanced combo strategy, but only after the screen
is increased to 30% and above.

7. Anomalies Across Size
In this section, we examine the strategies across various size groups. Fama and French
(2008) emphasize the point that, when studying anomalies, researchers often use equalweighted returns of a hedge portfolio, which can be dominated by microcaps (which
they define as stocks with market capitalization below the 20th percentile of the NYSE).
These tiny stocks typically account for 60% of the number of firms listed on NYSE,
NASDAQ, and AMEX, but they comprise only about 3% of the total market capitalization. Thus, they might be illiquid and accounting for transactions costs for these
stocks is important.
In table 13 we present gross and net excess returns for the 23 anomalies across
three size bins: micro-, small-, and large-caps. We first sort the universe of firms into
three bins. Following Fama and French (2008), we use NYSE 20th and 50th percentile
breakpoints. Then, in each group, we form each anomalies by slowing down sales
(short covers) for stocks leaving the size bins, but which would have otherwise stayed
in portfolio 10 (1).

Table 11: Trading momentum and PEAD on the margin of size
This table presents results from trading the momentum and PEAD strategies on the margin of the size
strategy. Panel A looks at size screened by momentum, while panel B looks at size screened by PEAD.
The screened strategies are enhanced by slowing sales (purchases) and short covers (shorts) when the
screening variable is in the top (bottom) x%, where x is indicated by the first column. The third column
shows each strategy’s turnover in percentages, the fourth one indicates its net excess return over the
risk-free rate. The fifth one presents the generalized four factor net α. Finally, the last three columns

In panel A, we look at the simple low-turnover strategies. Just like in Fama and
French (2008), the micro caps exhibit the highest gross excess returns, followed by the
small and the large caps. The transactions costs seem to be immaterial for the lowturnover anomalies, even for the micro caps. The only exception to this rule are the
micro caps Size, Accruals, and Piotroski’s F-score strategies, whose net excess returns
seem to drop to insignificant levels.
Not surprisingly, accounting for the cost of trading seems to matter a lot more for
mid- and high-turnover strategies. An interesting pattern emerges in panel B, which
looks at mid-turnover strategies. Again, just as in Fama and French (2008), the microcaps exhibit the highest gross returns. However, the differences in the net excess
returns between the three size bins seem to be much smaller. For example, the ValMomProf anomaly has gross excess returns of 1.67%, 1.42%, and 1.09% per month for
the micro-, small-, and large-caps, respectively, while the corresponding net returns
for this strategy are 1.27%, 1.14%, and 0.83%. This is not surprising, because firm
size is negatively correlated with transactions costs, and as long as there is sufficient
trading we should expect to see smaller stocks being disproportionately affected.
In this context, the net returns are even more affected by the effective spread in the
high-turnover strategies, as evidenced by panel C. The extremely high gross returns
across the microcaps turn severely negative once we account for transactions costs.
For example, the High-frequency Combo micro-cap strategy has a gross excess return
of 1.77% per month with a t-stat of 13.94. However, the net return for the same strategy
is -0.66% with a t-stat of -5.12. In fact, the net returns are not significantly positive for
all but two of the strategies. The high-frequency combo strategy achieves a monthly
return of 30 bp with a t-stat of 2.26 in the large caps and 35 bp and a t-stat of 3.40 in
the small caps. The low volatility industry relative reversals earns 31 bp with a t-stat
of 2.73 in the large caps and 28 bp with a t-stat of 1.96 in the small caps.
Figure 7 presents the same effects by plotting the Sharpe ratios for all the strategies
across the three size bins discussed above. A simple visual inspection shows that the

42

net and gross excess returns are not very different for the the low-turnover strategies.
Moreover, the larger differences across the three size bins in the gross returns seem to
be mitigated in the net returns for the mid-turnover strategies, and only a couple of
large-cap high-turnover strategies seem to survive transactions costs.

8. Conclusion
This paper studies the performance of a large number of anomalies after accounting
for transaction costs, and the effectiveness of several transaction cost mitigation strateTable 13: Value-weighted excess returns on sS strategies by size
This table presents results for returns on value-weighted long/short self-financing portfolios, constructed using a decile sort on a signal using NYSE breakpoints. For each strategy, gross and net
returns after transactions costs are presented across size bins, along with their t-stats in brackets. For
each strategy, sales (short covers) are slowed down for stocks leaving the size bins, but which would
have otherwise stayed in portfolio 10 (1). The breakpoints used for the size sorts are 20th and 50th percentile of all NYSE stocks. In panel A, low turnover strategies are presented. In Panel B, mid-turnover
10%/20% sS strategies are presented. In Panel C, high-turnover 10%/50% sS strategies are reported. In
all panels firms are first screened on size, and then sorted by the signal

Figure 7: Gross and net Sharpe ratios for anomalies across size terciles
This figure presents results for returns on value-weighted long/short self-financing portfolios, constructed using a decile sort on a signal using NYSE breakpoints. For each strategy, gross and net Sharpe
ratios are presented across size bins. For each strategy, sales (short covers) are slowed down for stocks
leaving the size bins, but which would have otherwise stayed in portfolio 10 (1). The breakpoints used
for the size sorts are 20th and 50th percentile of all NYSE stocks. In panel (a) and (b), low turnover
strategies are presented. In panels (c) and (d), mid-turnover 10%/20% sS strategies are presented. In
panel (e) and (f), high-turnover 10%/50% sS strategies are reported. In all panels firms are first screened
on size, and then sorted by the signal

45

gies. It finds that introducing a buy/hold spread, which allows investors to continue
to hold stocks that they would not actively buy, is the single most effective simple cost
mitigation strategy. Most of the anomalies that we consider with one-sided monthly
turnover lower than 50% continue to generate statistically significant spreads after accounting for transaction costs, at least when designed to mitigate transaction costs.
Few of the strategies with higher turnover do. In all cases transaction costs reduce the
strategies’ profitability and its associated statistical significance, increasing concerns
related to data snooping.

Appendix

A.1. Anomaly Construction
All strategies consist of a time-series of value-weighted returns on a long/short selffinancing portfolio, constructed using a decile sort on a signal using NYSE breakpoints. The period examined is between July 1963 and December 2012 (full period)
for the anomalies using the annual files and between July 1973 and December 2012
(recent period) for the anomalies using the quarterly files. For the strategies using the
annual files, accounting data for fiscal-year end of year t is matched with stock returns
data from July of year t+1 until June of year t+2 to avoid look-ahead bias. For the ones
that use the quarterly files, the accounting data for a given quarter are matched to the
end of the month in which they were reported.
All strategies are constructed using data downloaded from the merged CRSP and
COMPUSTAT industrial database. We start with all domestic common shares trading
on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ with available accounting data and returns. Book
equity of firms is calculated by adding the deferred taxes and investment tax credits
where available, and preferred stock values were incorporated in the following order
of availability - redemption value, liquidation value, or par value of preferred stock.
Book-to-market equity is calculated using the December of year t - 1 value for market
equity. Stock returns are adjusted for delisting where applicable. For further details
on the construction of the strategies, please see the referenced papers.
A.1.1

Low turnover Strategies

• Size - follows Fama and French (1993). The portfolios are constructed at the
end of each June using the CRSP end of June price times shares outstanding.
Rebalanced annually, uses the full period.
• Gross Profitability - follows Novy-Marx (2013). Gross Profitability = GP/AT,

47

where GP is gross profits and AT is total assets. Financial firms (those with SIC
codes between 6000 and 6999) are excluded. Rebalanced annually, uses the full
period.
• Value - follows Fama and French (1993). At the end of June of each year, we use
book equity from the previous fiscal year and market equity from December of
the previous year. Rebalanced annually, uses the full period.
• ValProf - follows Novy-Marx (2014). Firms are sorted into deciles based on the
sum of their ranks in univariate sorts on book-to-market and profitability. Annual book-to-market and profitability values are used for the entire year. Rebalanced annually, uses the full period.
• Accruals - follows Sloan (1996). Accruals =

∆ACT−∆CHE−∆LCT+∆DLC+∆TXP−DP
,
(AT+AT−12 )/2

where ∆ACT is the annual change in total current assets, ∆CHE is the annual
change in total cash and short-term investments, ∆LCT is the annual change
in current liabilities, ∆DLC is the annual change in debt in current liabilities,
∆TXP is the annual change in income taxes payable, ∆DP is the annual change
in depreciation and amortization, and (AT + AT−12 )/2 is average total assets
over the last two years. Rebalanced annually, uses the full period.
• Asset Growth - follows Cooper et al. (2008). Asset Growth=AT/AT−12 Rebalanced annually, uses the full period.
• Investment - follows Lyandres et al. (2008) and Chen et al. (2010). Investment =

(∆PPEGT + ∆INVT)/AT−12 , where ∆PPEGT is the annual change in gross total
property, plant, and equipment, ∆INVT is the annual change in total inventories,

Medium Turnover Strategies

• Net Issuance (M) - follows Fama and French (2008). Net issuance is the yearover-year change in adjusted shares outstanding, ADJEXQ × CSHOQ, where
ADJEXQ is the quarterly COMPUSTAT split adjustment factor and CSHOQ is
common shares outstanding. Rebalanced monthly, uses the recent period.
• Return-on-book equity - follows Chen et al. (2010). Return-on-book equity =
IBQ/BEQ−3 , where IBQ is income before extraordinary items (updated quarterly), and BEQ is book value of equity. Rebalanced monthly, uses the recent
period.
• Failure Probability - follows Campbell et al. (2008). Also used in Chen et al.
(2010). Failure Probability = −9.164 − 20.264NIMTAAVG + 1.416TLMTA − 7.129

equity to that of the S&P500, CASHMTA is the ratio of cash and short-term investments (updated quarterly) to the sum of market equity and total liabilities,
MB is the the market-to-book ratio, and PRICE is each firm’s log price per share,
truncated above at $15. Rebalanced monthly, uses the recent period.
• ValMomProf - follows Novy-Marx (2014). Firms are sorted based on the sum
of their ranks in univariate sorts on book-to-market, profitability, and momentum. Annual book-to-market and profitability values are used for the entire year.
Rebalanced monthly, uses the full period.
• ValMom - follows Novy-Marx (2014). Firms are sorted based on the sum of their
ranks in univariate sorts on book-to-market and momentum. Annual book-tomarket values are used for the entire year. Rebalanced monthly, uses the full
period.
• Idiosyncratic Volatility - follows Ang et al. (2006). In each month, firms are
sorted based on the standard deviation of the residuals of regressions of their
past three months’ daily returns on the daily returns of the Fama-French three
factors. Rebalanced monthly, uses the full period.
• Momentum - follows Jegadeesh and Titman (1993). In each month, firms are
sorted based on their cumulated past performance in the previous year by skipping the most recent month. Rebalanced monthly, uses the full period.
• PEAD (SUE) - follows Foster et al. (1984). Earnings surprises are measured by
Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE), which is the change in the most recently announced quarterly earnings per share from its value announced four
quarters ago divided by the standard deviation of this change in quarterly earnings over the prior eight quarters. SUE =
50

IBQ−IBQ−12
σIBQ−24 :IBQ−3 ,

where IBQ is income

before extraordinary items (updated quarterly), and σIBQ−24 :IBQ−3 is the standard
deviation of IBQ in the past two years skipping the most recent quarter. Rebalanced monthly, uses the recent period.
• PEAD (CAR3) - follows Brandt et al. (2008). Earnings surprised are measured
by the cumulative three-day abnormal return around the announcement (days
minus one to one). Rebalanced monthly, uses the recent period.
A.1.3

High Turnover Strategies

• Industry Momentum - follows Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999). In each month,
the Fama and French 49 industries are sorted on their value-weighted past month’s
performance and assigned to 10 industry deciles. Then, all firms in decile 10
(from the 5 winner industries) form the value-weighted long portfolio and all
firms in decile 1 (the 5 loser industries) form the short portfolio. Rebalanced
monthly, uses the full period.
• Industry Relative Reversals - follows Da et al. (2014) and Linnainmaa et al.
(2014). In each month, firms are sorted based on the difference between their
prior month’s return and the prior month’s return of their industry (based on
the Fama and French 49 industries). Updated monthly, uses the full period.
• High-Frequency Combo In each month, firms are sorted based on sum of their
ranks in the univariate sorts on industry relative reversals and industry momentum. Rebalanced monthly, uses the full period.
• Short-term reversals - follows Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) . In each month,
firms are sorted based on their prior month’s returns. Rebalanced monthly, uses
the full period.
• Seasonality - follows Heston and Sadka (2011). At the end of each month firms
are sorted based on their average return in the coming calendar month over the
51

preceding five years. Rebalanced monthly, uses the full period.
• Industry Relative Reversals (Low Volatility) - follows Linnainmaa et al. (2014).
In each month, firms are sorted based on the difference between their prior
month’s return and the prior month’s return of their industry (based on the Fama
and French 49 industries). Only stocks with idiosyncratic volatility lower than
the NYSE median for month are included in the sorts. Updated monthly, uses
the full period.

A.2. Fama-MacBeth regressions by size
Table 14: Determinants of transaction costs
The table reports results from Fama-MacBeth regressions of trading cost estimates on lagged trading
costs, market capitalization, and idiosyncratic volatility. The trading costs consist of the effective bidask spread measure proposed by Hasbrouck (2009). Idiosyncratic volatility is measured as the standard
deviation of residuals of past three months’ daily returns on the daily excess market return. Both market
capitalization and idiosyncratic volatility use end of July values. The regressions are estimated on an
annual frequency and cover 1963 through 2013. In panel A (B), only stocks with market capitalization
higher (lower) than the NYSE median are used.

Table 15: Strategy returns across trading cost tertiles
This table presents results for returns on strategies constructed within lagged transactions costs tertiles.
In each period, a conditional ten by three sort is conducted on market cap and lagged transactions costs.
Then, for each tertile, and across all ten size bins, firms are sorted into deciles based on the signals. For
each strategy, sales (short covers) are slowed down for stocks leaving the t-costs quintile, but which
would have otherwise stayed in portfolio 10 (1).

A.4. Cost Mitigation Technique Comparison
Table 16: Ex post mean variance efficient portfolio weights and Sharpe ratios
The table reports ex-post mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio weights on the net returns to the
Fama/French factors and each of the twenty-three anomalies, mitigated using the three mitigation
techniques separately and the multi-mitigation technique. Panel B presents results for mid-turnover
strategies, while panel B focuses on the high-turnover ones. For each anomaly, the weights in the
tangency portfolio are reported as well as the maximum attainable Sharpe Ratio. See table 2 and/or
Appendix A.1 for further details on the construction of the signals.
