The Global Velocity Curve 1952-1982

ABSTRACT

This paper provides evidence and an explanation for an empirical regularity

in the income velocity of money. Based on a cross country comparison in
the post World War II period of 84 countries arrayed from very low to very

high per capita income, velocity displays a U shaped pattern. This observed
cross country pattern is very similar to one observed in an earlier study
by the authors for a number of advanced countries for over a century.

The U—shaped pattern of velocity behavior is explained by an approach

which stresses the influence of institutional factors. On a secular basis
the downward trend in velocity is due to a process of monetization while

the upward trend is explained by financial development. On a cross country
basis industrialized countries with well developed financial systems should
generally display a rising trend in velocity while poor countries at an earlier

stage of economics growth should as a rule have falling trends. Velocity
in economies "in between" should exhibit a fairly flat pattern with a weak
positive or negative trend.

The Global Velocity Curve l952_1982*
I.

Introduction

In this paper we provide evidence and an explanation for an empirical

regularity in the income velocity of money. Based on a cross country comparison
in the post World II period of 84 countries arrayed from very low to very

high per capita income, velocity displays a U shaped pattern. This observed
cross country pattern is very similar to one observed in an earlier study
by the authors for a number of advanced countries based on a century of data.
The income velocity of money for a number of advanced countries displays
a U shaped pattern over the past century,1 declining from the late nineteenth
century to between the first and second quarters of the twentieth century

when it begins a secular rise. This pattern can be clearly seen in Figure 1
which shows the behavior of velocity for two advanced countries——the U.S.
and Sweden.

The central determinants of the decline in velocity stressed in the
literature are permanent income (Friedman and Schwartz (1963)2 interest rates
(including the own rate of return on money), (Latane 1954, Klein 1973), monetization

and the spread of commercial banking (Tobin 1965) and improved quality of

money (Klein 1977). The key determinants of its rise include: technological
improvements in the payments process (Fisher, 1911, Garvey, 1959 and Garvey

and Blyn 1970, Clower 1969, Townsend 1983) and the development of money substitutes

(Gurley and Shaw 1961). No single theory can explain both the secular decline
and rise of velocity.

2

In our previous work, Jonung (1978), Bordo and Jonung (1981) Jonung
(1983), Bordo and Jonung (1987) building on the work of Knut Wicksell (1934,
1936), we explain the secular behavior of velocity by stressing the influence

of institutional factors. According to our approach, the downward trend
in velocity is due to a process of monetization. This process encompasses
two interrelated forces, (a) the spread of the money economy, and (b) the

spread of commercial banking. The upward trend is explained by financial

sophistication and improved economic security and stability. By financial
sophistication is meant both the emergence of money substitutes and the development

of methods of economizing on cash balances. The rubric of improved economic
security and stability encompasses many aspects of the modern welfare state
as well as stabilization policies.

According to our approach, velocity is influenced by both sets of institutional
variables at the same time, but the monetization effect will first dominate

causing velocity to fall. Later the influence of financial development and
improved stability will be stronger than the monetization process causing

velocity to rise. The relative strength of these two sets of forces will
determine the dating of the turning point of velocity. Finally, these institutional
factors should be regarded as additional explanatory variables to the standard
determinants of velocity——real income or a measure of wealth and interest

rates. We thus view our approach as complementary to the traditional approach
stressing developments usually ignored in money demand studies.
In our previous work, Bordo and Jonung (1981) and Bordo and Jonung (1987)
Ch. 4, we tested our approach to the long—run behavior of velocity using

3

annual data for approximately one hundred years for five countries: the
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway. For each country
we develop empirical counterparts for the institutional variables discussed

above. We then add these variables to a standard regression of velocity
on interest rates and permanent income.

Our results show that inclusion of the institutional variables significantly
improve a benchmark regression of velocity on permanent income, interest
rates and cycle variable for every country.

In addition, in the majority

of cases the institutional variables are of the correct sign and significant
with the sole exception of our measure of economic security and stability.
Finally, we found that introduction of institutional variables lowers the
permanent income elasticity of the demand for money for each of the five

countries. We conclude that the use of permanent income in earlier studies
masks the influence of the institutional factors that have not been explicitly
dealt with in earlier studies.
In this paper we provide additional evidence for our approach by investigating
the global behavior of velocity in the post-World War II period since statistics
are available for this period or parts of it for practically all countries
in the world with the exception of the East European economies.

Our explanation suggests that the income velocity of money should behave
differently across countries depending on the stage of financial development.
Industrialized countries with well-developed financial systems should generally
display a rising trend in velocity while poor countries at an earlier stage

of economic growth should as a rule have falling trends. Velocity in economies

4

"in between" should exhibit a fairly flat pattern with a weak positive or
negative trend. Consequently testing this view, we should find a global
U-shaped velocity curve where the falling section represents financially
less developed economies, the turnaround section middle-income economies
and the rising section rich, highly industralized countries.

Section 2 discusses the data used. Section 3 discusses the patterns

expected. Section 4 constructs the U shaped global velocity curve. Section 5
presents an alternative piece of evidence for the global velocity curve based

on a pooled cross section time series regression. Section 6 makes comparisons
of our study with other studies. Finally Section 7 is a brief conclusion.
2.

The Data

To construct a global velocity curve we use data for more than 80 countries

from the early 1950's to the early 1980's. We are well aware that such data
may in many cases be of dubious quality, however, no reason exists for a
systematic bias in the data.

The International Financial Statistics is used to calculate two measures
of velocity, one far a narrow measure of money (Vi) and one for a broad measure

(quasi—money)(V2). In order to limit the number of countries studied, all
countries with a population of less than 2.5 million inhabitants in 1975

have been excluded. Likewise, countries for which less than nine consecutive
observations of velocity exist are not included in the sample. Following
these guidelines, the behavior of velocity, both Vl and V2, in a total of
84 countries is examined.

5

3. Patterns Expected
The institutional approach suggests that this cross-section data base
should give rise to a U-shaped pattern when countries are ordered by stages

of economic and financial development. An early stage would represent the
monetization process and the rise of the monetary economy at the expense

of barter. A later stage would stand for financial sophistication when money
substitutes are developed and economic stability is improved.
It is difficult to construct a few simple measures of these developments

for all countries studied. For this reason we have chosen real per capita
income as a proxy measure of the stage of financial development.

We adopt the grouping of the world economies suggested by the World

Bank in the World Development Report 1983. The following four major groups
of countries are isolated in this report: (1) industrial market economies
with an average GNP per capita of $11,120 in 1981.

(2) upper middle—income

economies with an average GNP per capita of $2,490 in 1981, (3) lower middle—income
economies with an average GNP per capita of $850, and (4) low-income economies.
The individual countries included in these four groups are displayed in Table 1.

As seen from the table the four groups are of roughly equal size. There
are 19 industrialized countries, 19 upper middle-income economies, 27 lower
middle-income and 19 low-income countries, altogether 84 countries.

The World Bank grouping also includes two other groups: East European
nonmarket economies (eight countries) and high-income oil exporters (four

countries). These are excluded as separate entities as no velocity series
are available from the East European countries (except for Rumania for a

6

very short period). Of the oil exporting countries only Libya and Saudi

Arabia fulfill the restrictions placed on the selection of countries. These
two economies are placed among upper middle-income countries.
We would expect to find for the countries in Table 1 a picture similar

to that shown in Chart 2. This chart gives a schematic picture of the behavior
of velocity for the narrow and the broad definition of the money stock suggested

by our approach and our previous research using longitudinal data. Both
Vi and V2 displays a U—shaped pattern, but the VI curve has an earlier turning

point than the V2 curve. This reflects substitution of interest-bearing

time deposits for demand deposits with financial development. We thus have
three phases in the stylized chart; the first phase when both Vi and V2 decline,
the second phase when Vi rises while V2 continues to fall and finally, the
third phase, when both velocity curves rise.

4. The Global Velocity Curve
The secular picture is examined using simple regression estimates of
the following form:
(1)

V = a +

bt,

where t stands for time.

Velocity is thus regressed on time as the independent variable. We
expect b (the time trend of velocity) to be negative for low-income countries
and positive for high-income countries and to be close to zero and/or at
least of smaller absolute magnitude for middle—income than for the richest

and poorest economies. We also expect the b coefficient to be different
for Vi and V2 as shown in Chart 2.

7

Table 2 shows regressions for the four country groupings mentioned above
as well as several other groupings to be discussed below.3

The aggregate

velocity curve is calculated as the average of individual country velocity
curves.4 The coefficient b for Vi is positive for the rich and the upper
middle-income economies and negative for the poor economies and the lower
middle-income countries - a result consistent with our approach. The regressions
for V2 reveal that the b coefficient is negative for all groups of countries.
The coefficient becomes gradually smaller in absolute value as real income
increases.

A comparison with the stylized curves in Chart 2, suggest that the Vi
and V2 curves have passed through the first and second phase but not fully
reached the third phase, when both curves display an upward trend.
The trends calculated in Table 2 for the four country groups are displayed

in Charts 3—6 together with the actual behavior of velocity. These charts
reveal that a linear trend follows actual velocity fairly closely. Experiments
with non—linear trends did not offer any advantages. The velocity curve
for the poor countries in Chart 6 does not start until 1957 as most poor
countries did not achieve nation status until the 1960's.

A comparison with the stylized curves in Chart 1, suggests that the
Vi and V2 curves have passed through the first and second phase but not fully
reached the third phase, when both curves display an upward trend.
The four charts 3-6 are then combined, using a common scale for velocity,

into one in Chart 7 to construct the global curve. Table 3 classifies all
countries used to construct the global curve by phases of secular velocity

8

behavior. According to our hypothesis, as illustrated in chart 2, Vi and
V2 should each pass through three phases: the first phase when both Vi and
V2 are falling; the second phase when Vi is rising while V2 continues to
fall; and finally, the third phase, when both velocity curves are rising.
In Table 3, the 84 countries in our sample are grouped into three phases
based on the signs of the regression coefficient b of equation (1) calculated
in Appendix 1.

In accordance with our hypothesis low income and lower middle

income countries dominate the first phase, middle income countries dominate
the second phase and rich countries dominate the thi.rd phase.

As can be clearly seen in Chart 7 the Vi curve has a U shaped pattern.
The velocity curve for the broader money stock measure, however, continues
to be downward sloping for all four groups of economies, albeit at a "slower"

rate. Chart 7 also shows that the level of the velocity curves for the rich
and the upper middle-income groups is lower than for the two other groups.
Two groups of countries did not fit into our classification scheme by

levels of per capita income: within the rich country group--Germany, Italy
and Japan; within the upper middle income country group--five high inflation
countries.5
First, within the group of rich economies underlying Chart 3, all except

Germany, Italy and Japan display falling trends in Vi. The common trend
behavior for these three countries are estimated in equation 5 in Table 2.

This pattern is also shown by the common velocity curves calculated for these
three countries in Chart 8.

9

We do not have a simple explanation of this trend for Germany, Italy

and Japan. One explanation (or part of it) would emphasize the financial
effects of World War II on these countries being "losers". The War could
have temporarily set the financial system "backwards" compared to the rest
of the rich countries, e.g. the destruction of the national currencies and/or
national debt in each of these countries, the decartelization of the banking

system in Germany and Japan. Thus, we would expect velocity to start rising
in the future following the standard pattern of the rich countries. Also,
the commercial banking system in these three countries has played a more
important role in financing industry and government than in many other countries.
Thus, the supply of money substitutes in the form of bonds and stocks has

been comparatively less in these countries. This would help to explain why
velocity has not exhibited the rising trend of other advanced countries.

However, the velocity curve (Vi) in Germany is almost horizontal while V2
falls which may indicate that Vi will start rising in the near future in
that country.

Separating Germany, Italy and Japan from the rest of the set of rich
industrialized economies gives rise to a more pronounced upward trend in
Vi and a flat V2 curve, thus moving this group of countries closer to the
third phase of Chart 2.

See also regression (5) in Table 2.

Second within the upper middle income group, five countries: Israel;
Uruguay; Chile; Argentina and Brazil; had positive trends greatly in excess
of the average value for the group as can be seen from regression (2) in
Table 2.

10

The annual average growth rates of Vi are 5.3, 2.0, 5.7, 6.7, and 3.5
percent, respectively, compared to an average of 1.0 per cent for the whole
group in Table 2.

The strong positive trend of Vi for these five countries is most likely

due to their extremely high and rising rates of inflation. The rate of inflation
should properly be regarded as an opportunity cost of holding money. As
it rises, the public reduces its holding of money —

in

particular currency

and non—interest bearing deposits - which dominate the narrow money stock

definition underlying the Vi concept.6
To highlight the role of high and rising inflation rates, countries

with average inflation rates above 20 per cent per year for the period are
singled out into one group consisting of the five above-mentioned countries;

Israel, Uruguay, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.7 The average velocity curve

as well as its time trend is calculated for them. See regression (7) in
Table 2 and Chart 9. This chart shows that Vi has a sharp upward trend;
Vi rises for the group from a level of 4 to a level of 13 from 1952 to 1982.

V2, however, remains fairly flat. This result likely reflects interest payments
on time deposits that partially compensate for high rates of inflation raising
the demand for interest bearing time deposits relative to noninterest bearing

demand deposits. Chart 10 displays the global velocity curve excluding the
high inflation economies. This gives rise to a sharp difference in the behavior
of Vi for the middle income economies seen in Chart 3. Excluding high inflation
countries, the trend of Vl falls instead of rises. The trend of V2, however,
is not greatly affected. Thus the turnaround point of the global Vi curve

11

is "pushed fOrward" to occur "between" upper middle—income and rich industrialized
economies. Judging from Chart 9, the velocity curves of lower middle-income
and upper middle—income countries are now quite similar.

5. Pooled Regression Results
An alternative piece of evidence for the U shaped global velocity curve

is to run a pooled cross section time series regression. Since we do not
have consistent measures of the institutional variables used in our earlier

studies for all the countries examined here we adopt real per capita income

as a very rough measure of financial development. We run the regression
of the form shown in Equation (2). This equation is expressed as a quadratic
function to capture the postulated U-shaped velocity curve. A log-linear
form is adopted to avoid problems of heteroscedasticity.

12

as the first difference of the log of the price level.

Di is a one-zero

durny for country i. According to our hypothesis, for both Vi and V2, b1
should be negative, b2 and b3 positive. Furthermore, our hypothesis postulates
that b1 should be largerin absolute value for V2 than for Vi.
Regressions of equations (2) over the period 1952-82 for 74 countries
for which a complete data set exists are presented in Table 4•8 Results

for both Vi and V2 are included. Results are shown using OLS and to account
for the presence of severe autocorrelation, adjusted with the Cochrane Orcutt
procedure.

The results for both vi and V2 using OLS conform to the predictions

of our hypothesis. All three independent variables have the postulated signs
and are statistically significant. When the data are corrected for the severe
autocorrelation observed using OLS, our hypothesis is also well confirmed

for both Vi and V2. Finally, the larger (in absolute value) coefficient
of per capita income in the V2 than in the Vl regressions (using OLS) conforms

with our hypothetical description of the two curves in Chart 2 that V2 should
decline more than Vi through much of the range.
The presence of severe autocorrelation in the OLS regression may reflect

the omission of important explanatory variables. This would not be surprising
since we use per capita income as a measure of all the different aspects

of financial development. The Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment does not account
for such an omission.

Consequently, we regard the evidence from the charts

as more informative than the regressions for the presence of a global velocity
curve.9' 10

13

6. Comparisons with Other Studies
Several other cross-country studies of velocity behavior have used IFS-data,
see e.g. Ezekiel and Adekunle (1964) Melitz and Corea (1970), Driscoll and

Lahiri (1982) and Townsend (1983). However, to our knowledge no study uses
such a long time period or as a complete a sample as we do here. Adekunle
and Ezekiel examined 37 countries for the period 1950-64, Meiitiz and Corea
examined 17 countries for the period 1952-1967 and Driscoll and Lahiri (1982)
studied 12 countries for the period 1952—1967.

The results of each of these studies are consistent with our approach

in a number of respects. Adenkunle and Ezekiel found for their sample of
countries that both Vi and V2 generally declined with the level of per capita
income, however, they detected some evidence for rising V at very high levels
of economic development.

Melitz and Corea demonstrated that the pattern of velocity across countries
is closely related to the level of per capita income, following a U shaped

pattern. Driscoll and Lahiri showed that the relative size of the agricultural
sector is positively related to velocity across countries, consistent with

the results in Bordo and Jonung (1981). Finally, Townsend (1983), using
Raymond Goldsmith's data (1982) showed that the pattern of velocity across
countries is positively related to the ratio of private credit to GNP, where
GNP is a proxy measure of financial development; a result also consistent
with our approach.11

7. Conclusion
Our approach suggests that velocity should be falling at the early stages

of economic development and rising at later stages. Using a world-wide sample

of 84 countries for the period 1952-1982, we find strong support for our

explanation. We believe that we are able to detect a global U-shaped velocity
curve similar to the long run velocity curves found in our earlier work.
Thus we regard the empirical evidence presented here - based on a data set
and on test procedures complementary to our long—run time series evidence
as additional evidence in favor of our institutional explanation.

literature surveyed in Bordo (1986).

2Friedman and Schwartz's explanation for the observed decline in velocity
(V2) in the U. S. from 1867 to just after World War 11, based on Friedman's
(1959) estimate of the permanent income elasticity of the demand for real
cash balances of 1.8, was that money can be regarded as a luxury good. Subsequently,
Friedman and Schwartz (1982) also regard the secular fall in velocity as
due to growing financial sophistication.

3Appendix 1 shows calculations of velocity trends for each of the 84
countries and Appendix 2 shows the individual velocity curves.
4For the calculation procedure see the Notes to Table 2.
5Within the upper middle income group, excluding high inflation countries,

Vi rises only in Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Portugal, Malaysia and Iraq.
V2 falls or is flat for all countries.

16

In the lower middle income group, Vi has an upward trend in three out
of 27 economies (Dominican Republic, Philippines and Thailand), a flat trend

in 9 cases and a downward trend in the remaining countries. V2 is flat or
falling in all cases.

Finally in the low income Group, Vi as well as V2 falls fairly sharply
in a large number of countries, in particular in African states such as logo,

Sudan, Tanzania, Upper Volta and Ethiopia. Only two countries actually display

an upward trend in Vi, namely Sri Lanka and India. All other countries have
a downward or flat trend in both Vi and V2.

6Laidler (1985) summarizes evidence for money demand studies for high

inflation countries. These studies show a strong influence from inflation
(expected inflation) upon the demand for money and thus on velocity in a
manner shown by Chart 9 and Table 2.

7An inspection of the velocity curves of individual countries in Appendix
2 reveals that periods of high and rising inflation rates tend to be associated
with rising velocity (Vi).
8The countries omitted from the original sample of 84 due to lack of

data are: Algeria, Argentina, Ivory Coast, Nicaragua, Senegal, Togo, Sudan,
Madagascar, Upper Volta and Burundi.

9The inclusion of separate dummy variables for each year to capture
time specific shifts in addition to the country dummies in the global velocity
curve produced results almost identical to these of Table 4 as did those
in regressions including a time trend as a separate independent variable.

17

10Converting per capita income for each country into U. S. dollars using
official exchange rates from the IFS data, as we did, may induce considerable

bias. Such a conversion assumes that the basket of goods consumed in each
country is identical to that of the U. S. Less developed countries tend
to consume a basket of goods more heavily weighted towards nontraded services

than do advanced countries. Thus converting per capita income of the less
developed country into the currency units of a more advanced country will

bias its measured income downwards. See Belassa (1964). The use of purchasing
power adjusted exchange rates as in Kravis, Heston and Summers (1978), may

help solve this problem. Considering the crude character of our proxy variable
for financial development in equation (2), i.e., real per capita income,
we did not attempt this procedure.

Other studies examining velocity across countries include Doblin (1951),
Fleetwood-Jucker (1958), Kaufman and Latta (1966) and Penman (1970).

The CNP per capita estimates refer o all countries within
each group, respectively. They are not representative for the
countries shown in the table as lack of data reduces the
selection of ccr.omies. However, the CN? per capita
estimates give a rough indication of the global spread

Group 7

Notes: The group specific velocity curveused for calculating the table
is derived in the following way. The mean level of velocity within each
country group is calculated for the first yea: fcr a base year which is
the maximum number of obzervaticns (count:es) is available. For the
other years the arithmetic means of the annual first differences are
calculated.
Going forward from the base year, these values are
successively added to the mean level as calculated above. Going backward

from the base year, the vaues are successively subtracted. ifl this
manner, we construct the common velocity curve for the whole period. The
procedure is halted when more than one thi:d of the maximum number of
countries have dropped out of the sample. (This occurs in 1962 for the
low-income countries).

Table 3.

Velocity.

During phase I the income velocity ofMi(Vi)
as well as of M2(V2 displays a negative secular trend,
during phase II Vi is rising while V2 is falling. During
