ABSTRACT
A single macroeconomic factor based on growth in the capital share of aggregate income exhibits
significant explanatory power for expected returns across a range of equity characteristic
portfolios and non-equity asset classes, with risk price estimates that are of the same sign and
similar in magnitude. Positive exposure to capital share risk earns a positive risk premium,
commensurate with recent asset pricing models in which redistributive shocks shift the share of
income between the wealthy, who finance consumption primarily out of asset ownership, and
workers, who finance consumption primarily out of wages and salaries.

Contemporary asset pricing theory remains in search of an empirically relevant stochastic
discount factor (SDF) linked to the marginal utility of investors. This study presents evidence
that a single macroeconomic factor based on growth in the capital share of aggregate income
exhibits signi…cant explanatory power for expected returns across a wide range of equity
characteristic portfolio styles and non-equity asset classes, with positive risk price estimates
of similar magnitude. These assets include equity portfolios formed from sorts on size/bookmarket, size/investment, size/operating pro…tability, long-run reversal, and non-equity asset
classes such as corporate bonds, sovereign bonds, credit default swaps, and options.
Why should growth in the share of national income accruing to capital (the “capital
share”hereafter) be a source of systematic risk? After all, a mainstay of contemporary asset
pricing theory is that assets are priced as if there were a representative agent, leading to
an SDF based on the marginal rate of substitution over aggregate household consumption.
Under this paradigm, the division between labor and capital of aggregate income is irrelevant for the pricing of risky securities, once aggregate consumption risk is accounted for.
The representative agent model is especially convenient from an empirical perspective, since
aggregate household consumption is readily observed in national income data.
But there are reasons to question a model in which average household consumption is the
appropriate source of systematic risk for the pricing of risky …nancial securities. Wealth is
highly concentrated at the top and limited securities market participation remains pervasive.
The majority of households still own no equity but even among those who do, most own
very little. Although just under half of households report owning stocks either directly or
indirectly in 2013, the top 5% of the stock wealth distribution owns 75% of the stock market
value.1 It follows that any reasonably de…ned wealth-weighted stock market participation
rate will be much lower than 50%, as we illustrate below. Moreover, unlike the average
household, the wealthiest U.S. households earn a relatively small fraction of income as labor
compensation, implying that income from the ownership of …rms and …nancial investments,

i.e., capital income, …nances much more of their consumption.2 Consistent with this, we …nd
that the capital share is strongly positively related to the income shares of those in the top
5-10% of the stock market wealth distribution, but negatively related to the income shares
of those in the bottom 90%.
These observations suggest a di¤erent approach to explaining return premia on risky
assets. Recent inequality-based asset pricing models imply that the capital share should
be a priced risk factor whenever risk-sharing is imperfect and wealth is concentrated in the
hands of a few investors, or “shareholders,”while most households are “workers”who …nance
consumption primarily out of wages and salaries (e.g., Greenwald, Lettau, and Ludvigson
(2014), GLL). In these models, redistributive shocks that shift the share of income between
labor and capital are a source of systematic risk for asset owners. In the extreme case
where workers own no risky asset shares and there is no risk-sharing between workers and
shareholders, a representative shareholder who owns the entire corporate sector will have
consumption in equilibrium equal to Ct KSt , where Ct is aggregate (shareholder plus worker)
consumption and KSt is the capital share of aggregate income.3 The capital share is then a
source of priced risk.
With this theoretical motivation as backdrop, this paper explores whether growth in the
capital share is a priced risk factor for explaining cross-sections of expected asset returns. We
…nd that an asset’s exposure to short-to-medium frequency (i.e., 4-8 quarter) ‡uctuations in
capital share growth has strong explanatory power for the cross-section of expected returns
on a range of equity characteristics portfolios as well as other asset classes. For the equity
portfolios and asset classes mentioned above, we …nd that positive exposure to capital share
risk earns a positive risk premium, with risk prices of similar magnitude across portfolio
2

In the 2013 SCF, the top 5% of the net worth distribution had a median wage-to-capital income ratio
of 18%, where capital income is de…ned as the sum of income from dividends, capital gains, pensions, net
rents, trusts, royalties, and/or sole proprietorship or farm.
3
This reasoning goes through as an approximation even if workers own a small fraction of the corporate
sector and even if there is some risk-sharing in the form of risk-free borrowing and lending between workers
and shareholders, as long as any risk-sharing across these groups is imperfect.

groups. A preview of the results for equity characteristics portfolios is given in Figure 1,
which plots observed quarterly return premia (average excess returns) on each portfolio on
the y-axis against the portfolio capital share beta for exposures of H = 8 quarters on the
x-axis. The estimates show that the model …t is high across a variety of equity portfolio
styles. (We discuss this …gure further below.) Pooled estimations of the many di¤erent stock
portfolios jointly and one that combines the stock portfolios with the portfolios of other asset
classes also indicate that capital share risk has substantial explanatory power for expected
returns. In principle, these …ndings could be consistent with the canonical representative
agent model if aggregate consumption growth were perfectly positively correlated with capital
share growth. But this is not what we …nd. For all but one portfolio group studied here,
aggregate consumption risk measured over any horizon exhibits far lower explanatory power
for the cross-section of returns, and/or is not statistically important once exposures to capital
share risk are introduced.
A notable result of our analysis is that an empirical model with capital share growth
as the single source of macroeconomic risk explains a larger fraction of expected returns
on equity portfolios formed from size/book-market sorts than does the Fama-French threefactor model, an empirical speci…cation explicitly designed to explain the large cross-sectional
variation in average return premia on these portfolios (Fama and French (1993)). Moreover,
the risk prices for the return-based factors SMB and HML are either signi…cantly attenuated
or completely driven out of the pricing regressions by the estimated exposure to capital share
risk.
We also compare the empirical capital share pricing model studied here to two other
empirical models recently documented to have explanatory power for cross-sections of expected asset returns, namely the intermediary-based asset pricing models of Adrian, Etula,
and Muir (2014) (AEM) and He, Kelly, and Manela (2016) (HKM). This comparison is apt
because the motivations behind the inequality- and intermediary-based asset pricing theories
are quite similar. Both theories are macro factor frameworks in which average household con-

3

sumption is not by itself an appropriate source of systematic risk for the pricing of …nancial
securities. In the intermediary-based paradigm, intermediaries are owned by “sophisticated”
or “expert”investors who are distinct from the majority of households that comprise aggregate consumption. It is reasonable to expect that sophisticated investors often coincide with
wealthy asset owners and face similar if not identical sources of systematic risk. Indeed, we
…nd that capital share growth exposure contains information for the pricing of risky securities that overlaps with that of the banking sector’s equity capital ratio factor studied by
HKM and the broker-dealer leverage factor studied by AEM. But the information in these
intermediary balance-sheet exposures is almost always subsumed in part or in whole by
the capital share exposures, suggesting that the latter contain additional information about
the cross-section of expected returns that is not present in the intermediary-based factor
exposures.
The last part of the paper provides additional evidence from household-level data that
sharpens the focus on redistributive shocks as a source of systematic risk for the wealthy.
First, we show that growth in the income shares of the richest stockowners (e.g., the top
10% of the stock wealth distribution) is su¢ ciently strongly negatively correlated with that
of non-rich stockowners (e.g., the bottom 90%), that growth in the product of these shares
with aggregate consumption is also strongly negatively correlated. This means that the inversely related component in the product operating through income shares outweighs the
common component operating through aggregate consumption. While this …nding is suggestive of limited risk-sharing, some income share variation between these groups is likely
to be idiosyncratic and capable of being diversi…ed away. We therefore form an estimate of
the component of income share variation that represents systematic risk as the …tted values
from a projection of each group’s income share on the aggregate capital share. Finally, we
form a proxy for the consumption of the wealthiest stockholders as the product of aggregate
consumption times the top group’s …tted income share. We …nd that estimated exposures to
this proxy help explain expected return premia on the same equity characteristic portfolios

4

that are well explained by capital share exposures.
Our investigation is related to a classic older literature emphasizing the importance
for stock pricing of limited stock market participation and heterogeneity (Mankiw (1986),
Mankiw and Zeldes (1991), Constantinides and Du¢ e (1996), Vissing-Jorgensen (2002),
Ait-Sahalia, Parker, and Yogo (2004), Guvenen (2009), and Malloy, Moskowitz, and VissingJorgensen (2009)). In contrast to this literature, the limited participation dimension relevant
for our analysis is not shareholder versus non-shareholder, but rather investors who di¤er
according to whether their income is earned primarily from supplying labor or from owning
assets. Our results suggest the relevance of frameworks in which investors are concerned
about shocks that have opposite e¤ects on labor and capital. Such redistributive shocks play
no role in the traditional limited participation literature.
A growing body of literature considers the role of redistributive shocks that transfer
resources between shareholders and workers as a source of priced risk when risk sharing is
imperfect (Danthine and Donaldson (2002); Favilukis and Lin (2013a, 2013b, 2015), Gomez
(2016), GLL, Marfe (2016)). In this literature, labor compensation is a charge to claimants
on the …rm and therefore a systematic risk factor for aggregate stock and bond markets.
In those models that combine these features with limited stock market participation, such
as that in GLL, the capital share matters for risk pricing. Finally, the …ndings here are
related to a body of evidence suggesting that the returns to human capital are negatively
correlated with those to stock market wealth (Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008); Lettau
and Ludvigson (2009); Chen, Favilukis, and Ludvigson (2014), Lettau and Ludvigson (2013),
GLL, Bianchi, Lettau, and Ludvigson (2016)).
We note that estimated exposures to capital share risk do not explain cross-sections of
expected returns on all portfolio types. Results (not reported) indicate that these exposures
have no ability to explain cross-sections of expected returns on industry portfolios, or on
the foreign exchange and commodities portfolios that HKM …nd are well explained by their
intermediary sector equity-capital ratio. Moreover, momentum portfolios present a puzzle

5

for both the inequality-based and the intermediary-based models, since these factors often
earn a negative risk price when explaining cross-sections of expected momentum returns.
The exploration of this momentum-related puzzle is taken up in a separate paper (Lettau,
Ludvigson, and Ma (2014)).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section I discusses data and presents some
preliminary analyses. Section II describes the econometric models to be estimated, while
Section III discusses the results of these estimations. Section IV concludes.

I. Data and Preliminary Analysis
This section brie‡y describes our data. A more detailed description of the data and our
sources is provided in the Online Appendix. Our sample is quarterly and unless otherwise
noted spans the period 1963:Q3 to 2013:Q4 before loosing observations to computing long
horizon relations as described below.
We use equity return data available from Kenneth French’s Dartmouth website on 25
size/book-market sorted portfolios (size/BM), 25 size/operating pro…tability portfolios (size/OP),
10 long-run reversal portfolios (REV), and 25 size/investment portfolios (size/INV). We also
use the portfolio data recently explored by HKM to investigate other asset classes, including the 10 corporate bond portfolios from Nozawa (2014) spanning 1972:Q3-1973:Q2 and
1975:Q1-2012:Q4 (“bonds”), six sovereign bond portfolios from Borri and Verdelhan (2011)
spanning 1995:Q1-2011:Q1 (“sovereign bonds”), 54 S&P 500 index options portfolios sorted
on moneyness and maturity from Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Savov (2013) spanning
1986:Q2-2011:Q4 (“options”) and the 20 CDS portfolios constructed by HKM spanning
2001:Q2-2012:Q4.4
We de…ne the capital share as KS

compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), measured on a quarterly basis.
There are well known di¢ culties with accurately measuring the labor share. Most notable
is the di¢ culty with separating income of sole proprietors into components attributable to
labor and capital inputs. But Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013) report trends for the labor
share, i.e., changes, within the corporate sector that are similar to those for sectors that
include sole proprietors, such as the BLS nonfarm measure (which makes speci…c assumptions
on how proprietors’income is proportioned). Indirect taxes and subsidies can also create a
wedge between the labor share and the capital share, but Gomme and Rupert (2004) …nd
that these do not vary much over time, so that movements in the labor share are still strongly
(inversely) correlated with movements in the capital share. Thus the main di¢ culties with
measuring the labor share pertain to getting the level of the labor share right. Our results
rely instead on changes in the labor share, and we maintain the hypothesis that they are
informative about opposite signed changes in the capital share. Figure 2 plots the rolling
eight-quarter log di¤erence in the capital share over time. This variable is volatile throughout
our sample.
The empirical investigation of this paper is motivated by the inequality-based asset pricing literature discussed above. One question prompted by this literature is whether there is
any evidence that ‡uctuations in the aggregate capital share are related in a quantitatively
important way to observed income shares of wealthy households, and the latter to expected
returns on risky assets. To address these questions, we make use of two household-level
datasets that provide information on wealth and income inequality. The …rst is the triennial survey data from the survey of consumer …nances (SCF), the best source of micro-level
data on household-level assets and liabilities for the United States. The SCF also provides
information on income and on whether the household owns stocks directly or indirectly. The
SCF is well suited to studying the wealth distribution because it includes a sample intended
to measure the wealthiest households, identi…ed on the basis of tax returns. It also has a
standard random sample of US households. The SCF provides weights for combining the

7

two samples, which we use whenever we report statistics from the SCF. The 2013 survey is
based on 6015 households.
The second household level dataset uses the income-capitalization method of Saez and
Zucman (2016) (SZ) that combines information from income tax returns with aggregate
household balance sheet data to estimate the wealth distribution across households annually.5
This method starts with the capital income reported by households on their tax forms to
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For each class of capital income (e.g., interest income,
rents, dividends, capital gains etc.,) a capitalization factor is computed that maps total ‡ow
income reported for that class to the amount of wealth from the household balance sheet
of the US Financial Accounts. Wealth for a household and year is obtained by multiplying
the individual income components for that asset class by the corresponding capitalization
factors. We modify the selection criteria to additionally form an estimate of the distribution
of wealth and income among just those individuals who can be described as stockholders.6
We de…ne a stockholder in the SZ data as any individual who reports having non-zero income
from dividends and/or realized capital gains. Note that this classi…cation of stockholder …ts
the description of “direct” stockowner, but unlike the SCF, there is no way to account for
indirect holdings in for example, tax-deferred accounts. The annual data we employ span
the period 1963-2012. We refer to these data as the “SZ data”.
The empirical literature on limited stock market participation and heterogeneity has often
relied on the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). We do not use this survey because we
wish to focus on wealthy households and there are several reasons the CEX does not provide
reliable data for this purpose. First, the CEX is an inferior measure of household-level assets
and liabilities as compared to the SCF and SZ data, which both have samples intended to
measure the wealthiest households identi…ed from tax returns. Second, CEX answers to
asset questions are often missing for more than half of the sample and much of the survey is

top-coded. Third, wealthy households are known to exhibit very high non-response rates in
surveys such as the CEX that do not have an explicit administrative tax data component that
directly targets wealthy households (Sabelhaus, Johnson, Ash, Swanson, Garner, Greenlees,
and Henderson (2014)). The last section of the paper considers a way to form a proxy for
the top wealth households’consumption using the income data.
Panel A of Table I shows the distribution of stock wealth across households, conditional
on the household owning a positive amount of corporate equity. The left part of the panel
shows results for stockholdings held either directly or indirectly from the SCF.7 The right
part shows the analogous results for the SZ data, corresponding to direct ownership. Panel
B shows the distribution of stock wealth among all households, including non-stockowners.
The table shows that stock wealth is highly concentrated. Among all households, the top
5% of the stock wealth distribution owns 74.5% of the stock market according to the SCF in
2013, and 79.2% in 2012 according to the SZ data. Focusing on just stockholders, the top 5%
of stockholders own 61% of the stock market in the SCF and 63% in the SZ data. Because
many low-wealth households own no equity, wealth is more concentrated when we consider
the entire population than when we consider only those households who own stocks.
Panel C of Table I reports the “raw” stock market participation rate from the SCF,
denoted rpr, across years, and also a “wealth-weighted”participation rate. The raw participation rate is the fraction of households in the SCF who report owning stocks, directly or
indirectly. The wealth-weighted rate takes into account the concentration of wealth. As an
illustration, we compute a wealth-weighted participation rate by dividing the survey population into three groups: the top 5% of the stock wealth distribution, the rest of the stockowning
households representing (rpr
and make up (1

:05) % of the population, and the residual who own no stocks

rpr) % of the population. In 2013, stockholders outside the top 5% are 46%

of households, and those who hold no stocks are 51% of households. The wealth-weighted

in 1986 is a condensed reinterview of respondents in the 1983 survey.

participation rate is then 5% w5% + (rpr

0:05) % 1

w5% + (1

rpr) % 0, where w5% is

the fraction of wealth owned by the top 5%. The table shows that the raw participation rate
has steadily increased over time, rising from 32% in 1989 to 49% in 2013. But the wealthweighted rate is much lower than 49% in 2013 (equal to 20%) and has risen less over time.
Note that the choice of the top 5% to measure the wealthy is not crucial; any percentage at
the top can be used to illustrate how the concentration of wealth a¤ects the intensive margin of stockmarket participation. The calculation shows that steady increases stock market
ownership rates do not necessarily correspond to quantitatively meaningful changes in stock
market ownership patterns, underscoring the conceptual challenges to explaining equity return premia using a representative agent SDF that is a function of aggregate household
consumption.
The inequality-based asset pricing literature predicts that the income shares of wealthy
capital owners should vary positively with the national capital share. Table II investigates
this implication by showing the output from regressions of income shares on the aggregate
capital share KSt . The regressions are carried out for households located in di¤erent percentiles of the stock wealth distribution. For this purpose, we use the SZ data, since the
annual frequency provides more information than the triennial SCF, though the results are
similar using either dataset. To compute income shares, income Yti from all sources, including wages, investment income and other for percentile group i is divided by aggregate income
for the SZ population, Yt , and regressed on the aggregate capital share KSt .8 The left panel
of the table reports regression results for all households, while the right panel reports results
for stockowners.
The information in both panels is potentially relevant for our investigation. The wealthiest shareholders are likely to be a¤ected by a movement in the labor share because corporations pay all of their employees more or less, not just the minority who own stocks. The
8

We use the average of the quarterly observations on KSt over the year corresponding to the year for
which the income share observation in the SZ data is available.

10

regression results on the left panel speak directly to this question and show that movements
in the capital share are strongly positively related to the income shares of those in the top
10% of the stock wealth distribution and strongly negatively related to the income share of
the bottom 90% of the stock wealth distribution. Indeed, this single variable explains 61% of
the variation in the income shares of the top 10% group (63% of the top 1%) and is strongly
statistically signi…cant with a t-statistic greater than 8. These R2 statistics are quite high
considering that some of the income variation in these groups can still be expected to be
idiosyncratic and uncorrelated with aggregate variables. The right panel shows the same
regression output for the shareholder population only. The capital share is again strongly
positively related to the income share of stockowners in the top 10% of the stock wealth
distribution and strongly statistically signi…cant, while it is negatively related to the income
share of stockowners in the bottom 90%. The capital share explains 55% of the top one
percent’s income share, 48% of the top 10%, and 50% of the bottom 90%. This underscores
the extent to which most households, even those who own some stocks, are better described
as “workers”whose share of aggregate income shrinks when the capital share grows.
Of course, the resources that support the consumption of each group contain both a
common and idiosyncratic components. Figure 3 provides one piece of evidence on how these
components evolve over time. The top panel plots annual observations on the gross growth
Yi

rate of Ct Ytt for the top 10% and bottom 90% of the stockowner stock wealth distribution,
where Ct is aggregate consumption for the corresponding year, measured from the National
Income and Product Accounts, while

Yti

is computed from the SZ data for the two groups

i = top 10, bottom 90. The bottom panel plots the same concept on quarterly data using

is much more volatile for the top 10% than the bottom 90% of the stockowner stock wealth
distribution, but both panels of the …gure display a clear negative comovement between
the two groups. Using the raw data, the correlation is -0.97. In the quarterly data, it is 0.85. Thus the common component in this variable, accounted for by aggregate consumption
growth, is more than o¤set by the negatively correlated component driven by their inversely
related income shares, a …nding suggestive of imperfect risk-sharing between the two groups.

II. Econometric Model
This section describes the econometric models we consider. Throughout the paper we use
the superscript “o”to denote the true value of a parameter and “hats”to denote estimated
values.
A. SDF and Beta Representation
Our main analysis is based on estimation of SDF models with familiar no-arbitrage Euler
equations taking the form

or equivalently,

where Mt+1 is a candidate SDF and Rjt+1
is the excess return on an asset indexed by j held

by the investor with marginal rate of substitution Mt+1 at time t + 1. The excess return is
e
de…ned to be Rj;t

Rj;t

Rf;t , where Rj;t denotes the gross return on asset j, with Rf;t a

risk-free asset return that is uncorrelated with Mt+1 .
In this paper we consider a stylized limited participation endowment economy in which
wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few investors, or “shareholders,”while most households are “workers” who …nance consumption out of wages and salaries. We suppose that
workers own no risky asset shares and consume their labor earnings. There is no risk-sharing
between workers and shareholders. In this case, a representative shareholder who owns the
12

entire corporate sector and earns no labor income will then have consumption in equilibrium
that is equal to Ct KSt , where Ct is aggregate (shareholder plus worker) consumption and
KSt is the capital share of aggregate income.10 These features of the model follow GLL.
Denote Ct KSt = Cst , where the “s”denotes shareholder.
To evaluate such a framework empirically, the econometrician could start by considering
an especially simple limited participation SDF in which the capital share plays a role via its
in‡uence on the richest shareholders’consumption:

of (6) could be measured with transitory error. Second, the econometrician’s simple SDF
(3) could be misspeci…ed and omit additional risk factors that do not appear in (3). In both
circumstances, estimates of multi-period risk exposures could be closer to the true one-period
exposures than are estimates of the one-period risk exposures.
A pre-existing literature has pointed out that measurement error in macroeconomic data
can have e¤ects on the estimation of asset pricing models. This literature has focused
mostly on how measurement error in consumption may in‡uence tests of the Consumption
CAPM. Daniel and Marshall (1997) show that long-horizon consumption growth can partially
explain the equity premium puzzle if quarterly consumption is contaminated by transitory
measurement error. Parker and Julliard (2004) suggest measurement error as motivation
for their use of long-horizon consumption growth and Kroencke (2017) studies methods for
undoing the smoothing-type …lters that data collection agencies appear to apply to di¤erent
components of aggregate consumption. Our framework di¤ers somewhat from the models in
these papers. Instead of using consumption growth, our model is based on the capital share
(or one minus the labor share), which unlike consumption is a ratio of two macroeconomic
series. Each of these series, labor compensation in the numerator and value added in the
denominator, are likely to be measured with error, leaving the magnitude of the e¤ect on
the ratio unclear. But smoothing …lters, of the type emphasized by Kroencke (2017) for
example, would contribute to positive autocorrelation in the growth of both the numerator
and denominator of the labor share. Except in knife-edge cases where these e¤ects exactly
cancel, such a smoothing procedure would contribute to the negative autocorrelation in the
the capital share growth rate that is observed in the data. In this case, the use of longhorizon betas could provide a simple method for undoing measurement error in capital share
growth caused by smoothing …lters.
An alternative reason for focusing on longer-horizon betas is that the simple SDF (3)
is likely to be misspeci…ed because it misses some additional risk factors. A growing body
of evidence using equity options data that suggests the existence of a volatile but highly

15

transitory component in equity market risk premia that is at odds with that a range of
consumption-based models, even those that generate a time-varying market risk premium
(e.g., see the evidence in Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009), Andersen, Fusari, and
Todorov (2013), and Martin (2017)). The time-variation in market risk premia generated
by standard consumption-based models is much less volatile and much more persistent than
that suggested by options data.
With this evidence in mind, suppose that the econometrician presumes the SDF takes
the form (3) but the true SDF instead takes the form
Mt+1 =
where

t

Cst+1

;

(8)

is a parameter and Gt+1 are any additional components of the SDF that contribute to

volatility in priced risk, but are unobserved to the econometrician.14 Since any such unknown
factors would be omitted from the right-hand-side of (6) by the econometrician, their presence
could bias estimates of risk exposures on the included factors such as capital share growth in
(6). In particular, if positive exposure to an omitted factor earns a risk premium, estimates
of risk exposures on the included factors in (6) will tend to be biased down whenever the
omitted factor is negatively correlated with the included factor. If, in addition, the omitted
source of risk is more transitory than the included source of risk, this bias can be mitigated
by estimating longer-horizon betas rather than one-period betas. The Online Appendix gives
a speci…c parametric example and simulation in repeated …nite samples of this phenomenon
in which it is shown that a substantial downward bias in estimated one-period capital share
betas may be attenuated by estimating the longer-horizon relationships in (7). In essence,
estimates of the long-horizon relationships …lter out the higher frequency “noise”generated
14

Following GLL, volatility in Gt+1 need not translate into unrealistic volatility in the risk-free rate if the
parameter t varies over time in a manner that generalizes to non-normal functions the familiar compensating
Jensen’s term that appears in lognormal models of the SDF (e.g., Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and Lettau
and Wachter (2007)). In the above, a speci…cation for t that renders the risk-free rate constant, for example,
is

by a more transitory omitted factor that is the source of the bias in the estimated one-period
exposures.
These examples motivate us to investigate whether multi-quarter, i.e., H-period, estimated risk exposures from regressions such as (7) explain cross-sections of one-period
e
(quarterly) expected return premia E Rj;t+1
. Note that the point of estimating longer-

horizon risk exposures in the …rst stage is not to ask how they a¤ect longer-horizon exe
pected return premia E Rj;t+H;t
in the cross section.15 The point is instead to obtain

a more accurate estimate of the true one-period exposures, which can be used to explain
e
one-period expected return premia E Rj;t+1;t
in the cross-section. For the linearized SDF

model (4), this may be implemented by running time-series regressions of the form (7) to
0
obtain bjH = bjC;H ; bjKS;H , and then running a second-pass cross-sectional regression of

the form

Although aggregate consumption growth in principle plays a role as a risk factor in (4),
we focus on the more parsimonious SDF model that depends only on capital share growth.
We do so because, as shown below, the capital share is the most important empirical component of Ct KSt for explaining cross-sections of asset returns, while the aggregate consumption
component is relatively unimportant. For this parsimonious speci…cation, we use a univariate time-series regression of H-period excess returns on H-period capital share growth to
estimate bj;KS;H and a cross-sectional regression to estimate the risk price

estimated jointly in one Generalized Method of Moments (GMM Hansen (1982)) system as
detailed in the Online Appendix.
Although we maintain the linear SDF speci…cations as our baseline, we also undertake a
GMM estimation that applies the approach just discussed to the nonlinear SDF version of
(4). The moment conditions upon which the estimation is based are in this case given by

For the reasons discussed above, this nonlinear estimation again implements the approach of
using H-period empirical covariances between excess returns Ret+H;t and the SDF Mt+H;t to
explain one-period (quarterly) average return premia E (Ret ) in the cross-section. The details
of this estimation are given in the Online Appendix and will be commented on below.
In the …nal empirical analysis of the paper, we explicitly connect aggregate capital share
‡uctuations to ‡uctuations in the income shares of rich versus non-rich stockowners using
the SZ household-level data to investigate whether a proxy for the consumption of wealthy
stockholders is priced in our asset return data. This investigation is described below.

SDF model (4).

As discussed above, we investigate whether H-quarter risk exposures explain quarterly
expected return premia in the cross-section. For the linearized SDF with Ct KSt = Cst ,

follow that the two factors are equally priced in the cross-section. That is,
19

in (9) could

be much smaller than

KS;H ,

in which case, capital share risk would be a more important

determinant of the cross-section of expected returns than is aggregate consumption risk,
despite their equally-weighted presence in the linearized SDF. To see why, observe that the
factor risk prices

1 , and b = (b1 ; b2 )0 : Equation (13) shows that, even if

will be smaller than

KS;H

whenever consumption growth is less volatile

than capital share growth and the two factors are not too strongly correlated.
We use GMM to estimate the elements of Cov(fH ; fH0 ) along with the parameters b, while
restricting b1 = b2 and using data on the same cross-sections of asset returns employed in
the main investigation of the next section. Doing so provides estimates of the risk prices
H

from (13). The following results are reported in the Online Appendix, for H = 4 and

H = 8 quarters. First, estimates of Cov(fH0 ; fH ) show that consumption growth is much less
volatile than capital share growth while the o¤-diagonal elements of Cov(fH0 ; fH ) are small.
As a consequence, estimates of

C;H

from (13) using data on di¤erent asset classes and equity

characteristic portfolios are in most cases several times smaller than those of

KS;H

despite

b1 = b2 . (See Table AI of the Online Appendix. The big exception to this are the estimates
using options data for H = 8). Note that if aggregate consumption growth were constant,
C;H

= 0 no matter what the value of b1 = b2 : This reasoning and the foregoing result

suggests that an approximate empirical SDF that eliminates consumption growth altogether
is likely to perform almost as well as one that includes it.
Second, Table AII of the Online Appendix shows the GMM restricted parameter estimates
of b1 = b2 (denoted b in the table) for explaining quarterly expected return premia when both
H-period consumption and capital share growth are included as risk factors, while Table AIII
shows the same when b1 is restricted to be zero, e¤ectively eliminating consumption growth
from the SDF. The results show that little is lost in terms of cross-sectional explanatory
20

power or pricing errors by estimating a model with b1 constrained to be zero. By contrast,
restricting b2 to be zero, i.e., dropping capital share growth from the linearized SDF, makes
a big di¤erence to the cross-sectional …t, which is typically far lower than the previous two
cases (Table AIV).
Given these results, we make the more parsimonious SDF that depends only on capital
share growth our baseline empirical model, i.e., Mt+H;t = b0

b2

KSt+H
KSt

1 , referred to

hereafter as the capital share SDF. This is estimated with a univariate time-series regression
to obtain bj;KS;H combined with the cross-sectional regression (10) to explain quarterly

expected return premia. Of course, if risk-sharing between shareholders and workers were

perfect, capital share growth should not appear in the SDF at all (i.e., b2 = 0) and only
growth in aggregate consumption should be priced in the cross-section once the betas for
both variables are included. But the results just reported show that this is not what we
…nd. The …ndings are therefore strongly supportive of a model with limited participation
and imperfect risk-sharing between workers and shareholders.
B. A Parsimonious Capital Share SDF
This subsection presents our main results on whether capital share risk is priced in
the cross-section when explaining expected returns on a range of equity styles and nonequity asset classes. This is followed by subsections reporting results that control for the
betas of empirical pricing factors from other models, statistical signi…cance of our estimated
beta spreads, and tests that directly use the distribution of income shares and wealth from
the household-level SZ data. In all cases we characterize sampling error by computing
block bootstrap estimates of the …nite sample distributions of the estimated risk prices and
2

cross-sectional R , from which we report 95% con…dence intervals for these statistics. The
bootstrap procedure corrects for the “…rst-stage” estimate of the risk exposures b as well

as the serial dependence of the data in the time-series regressions used to compute the risk
exposures. The Appendix provides a description of the bootstrap procedure.
Panels A-E of Table III report results from estimating the cross-sectional regressions (10)
21

on four distinct equity characteristic portfolio groups: size/BM, REV, size/INV, size/OP
and a pooled estimation of the many di¤erent stock portfolios jointly. To give a sense of
which portfolio groups are most mispriced in the pooled estimation, Panel F reports the
RM SEi =RM SRi for each group i computed from the pooled estimation on “all equity”
characteristics portfolios. Panels G-J report results from estimating the cross-sectional regressions on portfolios of four non-equity asset classes: bonds, sovereign bonds, options, and
CDS. Finally Panel K reports these results for the pooled estimation on the many di¤erent
stock portfolios with the portfolios of other asset classes. For each portfolio group, and for
H = 4 and 8 quarters, we report the estimated capital share factor risk prices bKS;H and
2

the R with 95% con…dence intervals for these statistics in square brackets, along with the
RM SE=RM SR for each portfolio group in the …nal row.

Turning …rst to the equity characteristic portfolios, Table III shows that the risk price
for capital share growth is positive and strongly statistically signi…cant in each of these
cross-sections, as indicated by the 95% bootstrapped con…dence interval which includes only
positive values for bKS that are bounded well away from zero. Exposure to this single

macroeconomic factor explains a large fraction of the cross-sectional variation in return
2

premia on these portfolios. For H = 4 and H = 8, the cross-sectional R statistics are 51%
and 80%, respectively for size/BM, 70% and 86% for REV, and 39% and 62% for size/INV,
2

and 78% and 76% for size/OP. The R statistics remain sizable for all three portfolio groups
even after taking into sampling uncertainty and small sample biases. And while the 95%
2

bootstrap con…dence intervals for the cross-sectional (adjusted) R statistics are fairly wide
in some cases especially for H = 4, for H = 8 most show relatively tight ranges around high
values, i.e., [52%; 91%] ; [68%; 96%] ; [29%; 81%], and [42%; 90%] for size/BM, REV, size/INV
and size/OP, respectively. The interval for all equities combined is [51%; 84%]. Moreover,
the estimated risk prices are similar across the di¤erent equity portfolio characteristic groups.
This is re‡ected in the …nding that the pooled estimation on the di¤erent equity portfolios
2

combined retains substantial explanatory power with an R equal to 0.74% and a risk price

22

estimate from the pooled “all equity” group that is about the same magnitude as those
estimated on the individual portfolio groups. Panel F, which shows the RM SEi =RM SRi
for each equity portfolio group i shows that the pricing errors are all very similar as a fraction
of the mean squared expected returns on those each group.
A caveat with the results above is that the estimated zero-beta rates

0

are large for

some cross-sections, a result suggestive of misspeci…cation. (The numbers are multiplied by
100 in the Table.) However, estimation of the full nonlinear SDF show that these zero-beta
parameters are often half as large or smaller than those reported above for the linear SDF
models. We discuss this further below.
Turning to the non-equity asset classes (corporate bonds, sovereign bonds, options, and
CDS), we …nd that the risk prices for the capital share betas are again positive and strongly
statistically signi…cant in each case. For H = 4 the capital share beta explains 86% of the
cross-sectional variation in expected returns on corporate bonds, 79% on sovereign bonds,
95% on options, and 84% on CDS. For H = 8, the …t is similar with the exception of sovereign
2

bonds, where the R is lower at 32%. The magnitudes of the risk prices are somewhat larger
on average for these asset classes than they are for the equity characteristics portfolios,
but they remain roughly in the same ballpark. This is re‡ected in the …nding that the
pooled estimation on “all assets”that combines the many di¤erent stock portfolios with the
2

portfolios of other asset classes retains substantial explanatory power, with an R equal to
2

78% for H = 4. For H = 8, the R from this pooled estimation is lower, equal to 44%, in
part because the …t for sovereign bonds is lower for this horizon.
Figure 1 and Figure 4 give a visual impression of these results. Figure 1 focuses on the
equity characteristic portfolios and plots observed quarterly return premia (average excess
returns) on each portfolio on the y-axis against the portfolio capital share beta for exposures
of H = 8 quarters on the x-axis. The solid lines show the …tted return implied by the
model using the single capital share beta as a measure of risk. Size-book/market portfolios
are denoted SiBj, where i; j = 1; 2; :::; 5; with i = 1 the smallest size category and i = 5

23

the largest, while j = 1 denotes the lowest book-market category and j = 5 the largest.
Analogously, size/INV portfolios are denoted SiIj, size/OP portfolios are denoted SiOj, and
REV portfolios are denote REVi.
Figure 1 shows that the largest spread in returns on size/book-market portfolios is found
by comparing the high and low book-market portfolios is the smaller size categories. Value
spreads for the largest S=5 or S=4 size category are much smaller. This underscores the
importance of using double-sorted (on the basis of size and book-market) portfolios for
studying the value premium in U.S. data. The betas for size/book-market portfolios line up
strongly with return spreads for the smaller sized portfolios, but the model performs least
well for larger stock portfolios, for example, S4B2 and S4B3 where the return spreads are
small. At the same time, the model …ts the extreme high and extreme low portfolio returns
almost perfectly for both sets of portfolios. Observations for the high return S1B5 and
low return S1B1 portfolios lie almost spot on the …tted lines. Thus, capital share exposure
explains virtually 100% of the maximal return obtainable from a long-short strategy designed
to exploit these spreads. Moreover, exposure to capital share risk alone produces virtually no
pricing error for the challenging S1B1 “micro cap” growth portfolio that Fama and French
(2015) …nd is most troublesome for their new …ve factor model. The pooled estimation for
all equities shows a similar result. Finally, the …gure shows that the spread in betas for all
sets of portfolios is large. For example, the spread in the capital share betas between S1B5
and S1B1 is 3.5 compared to a spread in returns of 2.6% per quarter. Thus, these …ndings
are not a story of tiny risk exposures multiplied by large risk prices.
Figure 4 shows the analogous plot for the pooled estimation that combines the many
di¤erent equity portfolios with the portfolios from the other asset classes. The results show
that the options portfolios are the least well priced in the estimations with H = 4 while CDS
and sovereign bonds are less well priced when H = 8: On the other hand, the micro cap
S1B1 and most equity portfolios remain well priced in the pooled estimation on all assets.
It is worth emphasizing that the estimates of

24

KS;H

reported in Table III imply reasonable

levels of risk aversion. These estimates, which use the two-pass regression approach, are
very close to the estimates of
b0

b2

KSt+H
KSt

KS;H

obtained from estimating the empirical model Mt+H;t =

1 using GMM and the restriction (13). (The GMM estimates of

KS;H

for each portfolio group are given in Table AV of the Online Appendix.) For example, for
the size/BM portfolio group, the two-pass regression approach produces bKS;H = 0:74 and
bKS;H = 0:68 for H = 4; and 8 respectively, while the GMM estimates of bKS;H = 0:74 and
bKS;H = 0:69. Moreover, the GMM estimates of

KS;H

correspond to estimates of b2 that are

10.1 and 4.9 for H = 4; and H = 8 respectively. (See Table AIII of the Online Appendix).
Bearing in mind that b2 should equal
estimates of

KS;H

from the theoretical model, this demonstrates that the

reported in Table III are consistent with plausible levels of risk aversion.

We close this section by brie‡y commenting on the results for the nonlinear SDF estimation (equations 11). These results are reported in Table AVI. Several results are worth
noting. First, the estimates of the (constant) risk aversion parameter

imply reasonable

values that monotonically decline with H from

= 4:2 at H = 8.

= 9:2 at H = 4 to

(These values are also very close to those obtained when estimating the linearized speci…cations; see Table AIII of the Online Appendix.) The …nding that estimates of risk aversion
decline with the horizon H is consistent with a model in which low frequency capital share
exposures capture sizable systematic cash ‡ow risk for investors, such that …tting return
premia does not require an outsized risk aversion parameter. Second, estimates of measures
of cross-sectional …t are similar to those for the linear SDF speci…cations. Third, estimates
of the zero-beta term

0

are in almost all cases much smaller than for the linear SDF and

typically not statistically distinguishable from zero.(the intercept values reported in the table
are multiplied by 100). The smaller values can occur if higher order terms that are omitted
in the linear SDF speci…cation contain a common component across assets, thereby biasing
upward the estimate of the zero-beta constant in the second stage regression.
C. Controlling for Other Pricing Factors
In this section we consider whether the explanatory power of capital share risk is merely
25

proxying for exposure to other risk factors. To address this question we include estimated betas from several alternative factor models and explore whether the information in our capital
share beta is captured by other pricing models by estimating cross-sectional regressions that
include the betas from competing models alongside the capital share betas. For example, we
estimate a baseline Fama-French three-factor speci…cation taking the form,
e
=
E Rj;t

0

+ bj;KS;H

KS

+ bj;M KT

M KT

+ bj;SM B

SM B

+ bj;HM L

HM L

+

j;t

and then include bj;KS;H as an additional regressor. Analogous speci…cations are estimated
controlling for the intermediary-based factor exposures, i.e., the beta for the leverage factor,

LevF act , advocated by AEM, or the beta for the banking sector’s equity-capital ratio advocated by HKM, which we denote EqF act in this paper. The betas for the alternative models
are are estimated in the same way as in the original papers introducing those risk factors.
For size/BM we compare the model to the Fama-French three-factor model, which uses
e
, SM Bt and HM Lt as factors, an empirical speci…cation
the market excess return Rm;t

explicitly designed to explain the large cross-sectional variation in average return premia
on these portfolios. We also consider the intermediary SDF model of AEM using their
broker-dealer leverage factor LevF act , and the intermediary SDF model of HKM using their
e
banking equity-capital ratio factor EqF act jointly with the market excess return Rm;t
, which

HKM argue is important to include. In all cases we compare the betas from these models to
capital share betas for H = 8 quarter horizons. Because the number of factors varies widely
across these models, we rank competing speci…cations according to a Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) that adjusts for the number of free factor risk prices

chosen to minimize

the pricing errors. The smaller is the BIC criterion, the more preferred is the model.
Table IV reports results that control for the Fama-French factor betas. The …rst set of
results forms the relevant benchmark by showing how these models perform on their own.
Comparing to this benchmark, the results in Panel A of Table IV for size/book-market
portfolios show that the capital share risk model generates pricing errors that are lower than
the Fama-French three-factor model. The RMSE/RMSR pricing errors are 12% for capital
26

2

share model and 15% for the Fama-French three-factor model. The cross-sectional R = 0:80
for the capital share model, as compared to 0:69 for the Fama-French three-factor model.
Panel B shows a similar comparison holds for the pooled estimation on all four types of
equity characteristic portfolios.
Once the capital share beta is included alongside the betas from the Fama-French model
in the cross-sectional regression, the risk prices on the exposures to SM Bt and HM Lt fall
by large magnitudes. For example, the risk price for HM Lt declines 82% from 1.35 to 0.24.
Moreover, the 95% con…dence intervals for these risk prices are far wider, which now include
values around zero. By contrast, the risk price for the capital share beta retains its strong
explanatory power and most of its magnitude. According to the BIC criterion, the single
capital share risk factor performs better than the three-factor model in explaining these
portfolios. A similar …nding holds for the pooled regression on all equities (Panel B). It is
striking that a single macroeconomic risk factor drives out better measured return-based
factors that were designed to explain these portfolios.
Table V compares the pricing power of the capital share model to the intermediary-based
models for the four equity characteristics portfolios, as well as the pooled estimation on all
equity portfolios jointly. For the most part, the intermediary-models do well on their own,
and we reproduce the main …ndings of these studies. For all portfolios types, however, the
2

capital share risk model has the lowest pricing errors, lowest BIC criterion, and highest R .
Once we include the capital share beta alongside the betas for these factors we …nd that the
risk prices for intermediary factors are either signi…cantly attenuated or driven out of the
pricing regressions by the estimated exposure to capital share risk. This is especially true of
the equity-capital ratio factor EqF act where the con…dence intervals are wide and include
zero once the capital share beta is included while the risk price for the capital share beta
retains its strong explanatory power and most of its magnitude in all cases. These …ndings
suggest that the information contained in the intermediary balance sheet factors for risk
pricing is largely subsumed by that in capital share growth.
27

Table VI further compares the capital share model’s explanatory power for cross-sections
of expected returns on the non-equity asset classes with the HKM intermediary model, which
was also employed to study a broad range of non-equity classes. As shown above, the risk
price for the capital share beta is positive and statistically signi…cant in non-equity portfolio case, explaining 89% of the cross-sectional variation in expected returns on corporate
bonds, 81% on options, 94% on CDS, and 32% on sovereign bonds. In a separate regression,
e
the risk prices for the betas of EqF act and Rm;t
are positive and have strong explanatory

power for each of these groups, consistent with what HKM report. But when we include
e
the capital share betas alongside the betas of EqF act and Rm;t
, we …nd that the risk prices

for exposures to EqF act become negative when pricing corporate bonds and CDS and statistically insigni…cant when pricing every category except options. By contrast, the capital
share risk price remains positive and strongly signi…cant in each case. When pricing options,
e
retain independent statistical
both the capital share beta and those for EqF act and Rm;t

explanatory power. However, for both models, the magnitudes of the estimated risk prices
when estimated on the options portfolios are somewhat larger than those estimated on other
portfolios. For example, compared to the estimations on size/BM portfolios, the estimated
options risk price for KS growth (alone) is a bit over twice as large, while that for EqF act
is more than three times as large. When all three betas are included to explain the crosssection of options returns, the risk-price for KS growth is then about the same as it is for
explaining size/BM, while that for EqF act is still more than twice as large.
D. Spreads Between the Betas
Figures (1) and (4) discussed above show large spreads in the estimated capital share
betas between the high and low return portfolios in each asset group. These …ndings suggest
that the explanatory power of capital share risk exposure for the cross-section of expected
asset returns is not the product of tiny risk exposures multiplied by large risk prices. A
potential concern, however, is that the estimated betas may be imprecisely measured, so that
the spreads are not statistically signi…cant. To address this concern, we compute the spread
28

in capital share betas between the highest and lowest average quarterly return portfolio for
each portfolio group, along with 95% bootstrapped con…dence interval for the spread. For
comparison, we also report the same numbers for the spread in the Fama-French factor betas
and the intermediary-based factor betas. For the size/BM portfolio group, we separately
analyze the largest attainable value premium (the spread in returns/betas between the S1B5
and S1B1 portfolios), and the largest attainable size premium (the spread in returns/betas
between the S1B5 and S5B5 portfolios). To facilitate the comparison across models, all
factors are standardized to unit variance before performing the calculation.17 The results
are reported in Table VII.
Panel A of Table VII shows the spreads in betas for the value premium. The spread
in capital share betas when H = 4 is slightly smaller than that of the HM L beta, but is
more than two times larger than the HM L beta spread when H = 8: (The spread in H = 8
quarter capital share betas is 0.13, versus 0.06 for HM L beta spread, 0.041 for the EqF ac
beta spread, and 0.015 for the LevF ac beta spread.) For all models except LevF ac, these
spreads are statistically di¤erent from zero, as indicated by the 95% con…dence sets for the
spreads that exclude zero. Panel B shows the analogous results for the size premium. The
spread in the H = 8 quarter capital share betas corresponding to the size premium is 0.093,
versus 0.076 for the SM B beta spread, 0.002 for the EqF ac beta spread, and 0.005 for
the LevF ac beta spread. In this case the spreads in the capital share and SM B betas are
statistically signi…cant, while those for EqF ac and LevF ac are statistically signi…cant.
Panels C-J of Table VII present results for the other eight portfolio groups and may
be summarized as follows.18 There are three sets of portfolios for which the spread in
capital share betas between the high and low average return portfolios for each group are
quantitatively sizable but not statistically signi…cant. These are: size/INV, sovereign bonds,
17

For this reason the units of the betas are than those in Figures (1) and (4).
The numbers in Panel F for “All Equities” are identical to those in Panel A for the value premium
because the spread in average returns between the S1B5 and S1B1 portfolios is the largest in the All
Equities category.
18

29

and options. However, the spreads in HM L, SM B, EqF ac and LevF ac betas are also
insigni…cant for two of these (sovereign bonds and options), and smaller in magnitude than
the capital share beta spread. On the size/INV portfolio group, the spread in SM B betas is of
the same magnitude as the spread in H = 8 quarter capital share betas, but in contrast to the
spread in capital share betas, statistically signi…cant. For the remaining …ve other portfolios
groups (REV, size/OP, all equities, bonds, and CDS), the spread in capital share betas is
in each case several times larger than the spreads in HM L, SM B, EqF ac and LevF ac
betas, and statistically signi…cant. For the all equities portfolio group, only the spreads in
H = 8 capital share betas, EqF ac betas, and HM L betas are statistically signi…cant, with
the largest spread magnitude identi…ed with the capital share betas equal to 0.129, followed
by 0.056 for the HM L beta spread and 0.041, for the EqF ac beta spread. For size/OP,
only the spread in the capital share betas (for both H = 4; 8) and the spread in SM B betas
are statistically signi…cant, with the H = 8 capital share beta spread 1.3 times as large as
the SM B beta spread. For corporate bonds, the spread in H = 8 capital share betas is 4.9
times larger than the model with the next largest spread, (the HM L beta), while the spread
in all other betas are statistically insigni…cant. Finally, for the CDS portfolio group, only
the spread in H = 8 capital share betas is statistically signi…cant, and is …ve times large in
magnitude than the model with the next largest spread, (the EqF ac beta). Taken together,
these results indicate that the capital share exposures consistently exhibit large spreads for
a range of portfolio groups and compare favorably relative to competing models, even when
taking into account sampling error.
E. An SDF Based On Household-Level Data
A core hypothesis of this investigation is that an SDF based on the marginal utility of the
wealthiest households is more likely to be relevant for the pricing of risky securities than is
one based on that of the average household. In the …nal empirical analysis of the paper, we
therefore explicitly connect capital share variation to ‡uctuations in the micro-level income
shares of rich and non-rich stockowners using the SZ household-level data. The SZ household30

level income and wealth data are especially advantageous for this purpose because they are
of high quality and detailed and, as discussed above, reliable household-level consumption
data are unavailable for the wealthy. Thus we use the SZ household-level income and wealth
data to construct a proxy for the consumption growth and SDF of rich stockowners.
To motivate this exercise, …rst note that the consumption of a representative stockowner
in the ith percentile of the stock wealth distribution can be tautologically expressed as Ct it ,
where

i
t

is the ith percentile’s consumption share in period t. We do not observe Ct

because reliable observations on

i
t

reliable estimates of income shares,

i
t

are unavailable for wealthy households. We do observe
Yit
;
Yt

however, and a crude estimate of the ith percentile’s

consumption could be constructed as Ct YYitt . But since some of the variation in

Yit
Yt

across

percentile groups is likely to be idiosyncratic, capable of being insured against and therefore
not priced, a better measure would be one that isolates the systematic risk component of the
income share variation. Given imperfect insurance between workers and capital owners, the
inequality-based literature discussed above implies that ‡uctuations in the aggregate capital
share should be a source of non-diversi…able income risk to which investors are exposed. We
therefore form an estimate of the component of income share variation for the ith percentile
that represents systematic risk by replacing observations on
projection of

Yit
Yt

with the …tted values from a

Yit
Yt

on KSt . (Note that this is not the same as using KSt itself as a risk-factor.)
c
Yi
i
That is, we ask whether betas for the H-period growth in Ct Ytt are priced, where Y\
t =Yt =

b& i0 + b& i1 (KSt ) are quarterly observations on …tted income shares from the ith percentile. The
parameters b& i0 and b& i1 are the estimated intercepts and slope coe¢ cients from the regressions

of income shares on the capital share reported in the right panel of Table II pertaining
c
Yi
to households who are stockholders. We refer to Ct Ytt as a proxy for the ith percentiles
consumption. Finally, we focus on i = top 10% of the stockowner stock wealth distribution.

Estimates from the cross-sectional regressions of expected returns on the …ve equity portfolios
are given in Table VIII.
Table VIII shows that the betas for this proxy for rich stockowner’s consumption growth
31

strongly explains return premia on all equity portfolios. For size/BM portfolios, the H = 8
>10
Yd
quarter growth in Ct tYt (where “> 10”denotes top 10% in the table) explains 85% of the
cross-sectional variation in expected returns, with a positive and strongly statistically sig-

ni…cant risk price. It explains 84%, 69%, and 74%, respectively, of the variation in expected
returns on the REV, size/INV and size/OP portfolios. These …ndings are consistent with
the hypothesis that rich stockowners are marginal investors for these portfolio groups.

IV. Concolusion
This paper …nds that exposure to a single macroeconomic variable, namely ‡uctuations in the growth of the capital share of national income, has substantial explanatory
power for expected returns across a range of equity characteristics portfolios and other asset classes. These assets include equity portfolios formed from sorts on size/book-market,
size/investment, size/operating pro…tability, long-run reversal, and non-equity asset classes
such as corporate bonds, sovereign bonds, credit default swaps, and options. Positive exposure to capital share risk earns a signi…cant, positive risk premium with estimated risk
prices of similar magnitude across portfolio groups. The information contained in capital
share exposures subsumes the information contained in the …nancial factors SM B and HM L
for pricing equity characteristics portfolios as well as previously successful empirical factors
that use intermediaries’balance sheet data. A proxy for the consumption growth of the top
10% of the stock wealth distribution using household-level income and wealth data exhibits
similar substantial explanatory power for the equity characteristic portfolios. These …ndings
are commensurate with the hypothesis that wealthy households, whose income shares are
strongly positively related to the capital share, are marginal investors in many asset markets
and that redistributive shocks that shift the allocation of rewards between workers and asset
owners are an important source of systematic risk.

Capital Share Beta

Figure 4: Capital share betas. Betas constructed from Fama-MacBeth regressions of average returns on
capital share beta using all assets (size/bm, REV, size/INV, size/OP equities plus bonds, sovereign bonds,
CDS and Options). H indicates the horizon in quarters over which capital share exposure is measured. The
sample spans the period 1963Q3 to 2013Q4.

Table I: Distribution of Stock Market Wealth
This table reports the percentage of the stock wealth owned by the percentile group reported in the …rst
column. Panel A is conditional on the household being a stockowner, while Panel B reports the distribution
across all households. SCF stock wealth ownership is based on direct and indirect holdings of public equity
where indirect holdings include annuities, trusts, mutual funds, IRA, Keogh Plan, other retirement accounts.
Stock ownership in SZ data is based on direct stock holdings only. Panel C reports stock market participation
rate. The wealth-weighted participation rate is calculated as Value-weighted ownership 5% w5% + (rpr
0:05)% 1 w5% + (1 rpr) % (0) where rpr is the raw participation rate (not in percentage point) in the
…rst row. w5% is the proportion of stock market wealth owned by top 5% .

Table II: Regressions of Income Shares on the Capital Share
This table presents the regressions of income shares on the capital shares. The groups refer to the percentiles
of the stock wealth distribution. “ ” and “ ” indicate statistical signi…cance at the 10% and 5% level,
Yi
respectively. Ytt is the income share for group i. KS is the capital share. OLS t-statistics are reported in
parenthesis. The sample spans the period 1963Q3 to 2013Q4.

Table VII: (cont.) Beta Spread
This table reports the spread in betas between the highest and lowest average return portfolio for each
High
portfolio group.
denotes the highest average return portfolio beta; and low denotes the lowest
average return portfolio beta. In the case of size/BM portfolios, these are separated into spreads along
the value dimension (value spread) and size dimension (size spread) where e.g., S1B5 denotes the highest
return portfolio along the value dimension, which is the portfolio is the smallest size category and largest
book-market category. Bootstrap 95% con…dence intervals are reported in square brackets.
