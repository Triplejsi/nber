Unemployment and Health Behaviors Over the Business Cycle: a Longitudinal View
Gregory Colman and Dhaval Dave
NBER Working Paper No. 20748
December 2014
JEL No. E32,I12,J22
ABSTRACT
We examine the first-order internal effects of unemployment on a range of health behaviors during
the most recent recession using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). Consistent with prior studies based
on cross-sectional data, we find that becoming unemployed is associated with a small increase in leisure-time
exercise and in body weight, a moderate decrease in smoking, and a substantial decline in total physical
activity. We also find that unemployment is associated with a decline in purchases of fast food. Together,
these results imply that both energy consumption and expenditure decline in the U.S. during recessions,
the net result being a slight increase in body weight. There is generally considerable heterogeneity
in these effects across specific health behaviors, across the intensive and extensive margins, across
the outcome distribution, and across gender.

Introduction
Unemployment often imposes a heavy financial burden on households, but whether it

also imposes a health cost is much debated (Jin, Shah, & Svoboda, 1995; Ruhm, 2000; Stevens,
Miller, Page, & Filipski, 2011). Some health effects are direct and uncontroversial, such as an
increase in psychological stress and stress-related illnesses, while others are indirect and more
complex. In particular, some researchers find that unemployment causes persons to behave more
healthily: they smoke and drink less, and exercise and sleep more, changes that if maintained
would improve health (Ruhm, 2003, 2005). Others have found that unemployment does not
improve health behaviors or even makes them worse (Böckerman et al., 2007; Charles &
DeCicca, 2008; Colman & Dave, 2013; Dave & Kelly, 2012). The studies mentioned above
consider the effect of the macroeconomy on health behaviors. A separate and older literature has
looked at the effects on health and health behaviors of a person’s own employment status. These
studies, however, have generally focused on narrow samples of workers (i.e. construction
workers, as in Leino-Arjas, Liira, Mutanen, Malmivaara, and Matikainen, 1999), or they have
focused simply on correlations without attempting to infer causal effects, or sought causal effects
but lacked plausibly exogenous shocks to employment. In this study we use two nationallyrepresentative longitudinal surveys, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), to examine whether a large exogenous
shock to employment—the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009—affected cigarette smoking,
obesity, recreational exercise, total physical activity, routine medical visits, and several measures
of dietary behavior.
We address several key gaps in the literature and make a number of contributions. To
begin with, ours is the first study, as far as we know, that analyzes the effect of unemployment

3

on energy intake, energy expenditure, and the net effect (BMI) among a given sample of persons
over time, that is, using longitudinal data. This is especially valuable in studying BMI. Prior
research on the effects of unemployment on BMI has either found no or small effects of
unemployment. This may reflect that the true effect, if it exists, is simply too small to measure
given the errors in measuring height, weight, and employment status in a sufficiently large
population-based sample. Therefore there is value in determining the effect by joining a
combination of related outcomes. By analyzing both energy intake and expenditure we can
assess if they appear to balance, and thus support a null BMI effect, or if they both imply that
BMI should increase or decrease. In any case, analyzing both energy intake and outflow for the
same persons over time can place the BMI results in context.
Second, unlike other longitudinal studies of health behaviors and unemployment (e.g.
Ásgeirsdóttir, Corman, Noonan, Ólafsdóttir, & Reichman, 2014; Falba, Teng, Sindelar, & Gallo,
2005; Leino-Arjas et al., 1999; Morris & Cook, 1991; Novo, Hammarström, & Janlert, 2000),
our data sets span two recessions for most of our outcomes, and envelopes the recent recession
for all of them (Ásgeirsdóttir et al., 2014).1 All studies seeking the causal effect of
unemployment rely on exogenous increases or decreases in unemployment. Job loss is much
more likely to be exogenous in a recession, especially one as deep as the most recent one. Also,
job loss in a booming economy is less likely to identify the effects of unemployment than in a
prolonged recession. Recent job losers will change their behavior little if they expect soon to be
re-employed, whereas if they expect joblessness to last, they will adjust to a possibly prolonged
decline in income and increase in non-working time. In addition, compared with prior

1

waves pre- and post-crisis.

4

longitudinal studies, our data contain multiple observations on each participant over a much
longer time span, from 1999 to 2009 in the PSID, and from 1998 to 2010 in the NLSY79.
Finally, a number of the outcomes we study have been analyzed previously using only
cross-sectional data (e.g. Pharr, Moonie, and Bungum (2011)), essentially comparing the health
behaviors of employed and unemployed persons. Of course, such comparisons cannot reveal
unemployment’s causal effect because of the many unobserved differences between the two
groups, many of which can be controlled for in longitudinal analysis. Some studies have
sidestepped the endogeneity of employment status by looking only at unemployed persons who
lost their jobs because their companies closed down (Deb, Gallo, Ayyagari, Fletcher, & Sindelar,
2011; Salm, 2009). Nonetheless, certain questions can only be addressed with longitudinal data.
For example, prior cross-sectional studies have found that an increase in unemployment is
associated with an increase in light physical activity, though not with an increase in vigorous
physical activity (e.g Ruhm, 2005). These studies have tended to interpret this result as showing
that formerly inactive persons have become moderately active. However, perhaps the higher
unemployment rate has caused vigorous exercisers to become light exercisers. There is no way to
distinguish these possibilities using cross sectional data. With our long-span longitudinal data,
we can parse out the effects for persons who are initially sedentary or active prior to any shift in
their employment status. Similarly, if recessions reduce smoking, cross-sectional data cannot
reveal whether the change reflects light smokers quitting or heavy smokers cutting back. We are
also able to differentiate the effects of short-term versus long-term unemployment, which may
elicit heterogeneous responses across various health behaviors. Another issue, which cannot be
studied with cross-sectional data and that has subsequently been bypassed in the literature,
relates to potential compositional selection bias arising from inter-state migration that is

5

correlated with job prospects and health. With longitudinal information, we can assess the
sensitivity of the estimates to controlling for this selective migration.
II. Literature Review
Prior studies on the effect of unemployment on health and health behaviors fall into two
groups (Burgard, Ailshire, & Kalousova, 2013; Colman & Dave, 2013). The first looks at the
effect of a person’s own employment status, the second, on the effect of the unemployment rate
or employment-to-population ratio in a person’s area of residence. The effects found in the two
groups of studies need not be similar, as a rise in the local unemployment rate may affect a
person’s behavior even if she herself remains employed. It may reduce demand for her product,
causing her to work fewer hours, or lead her spouse to become unemployed, affecting the
distribution of activities within the household (Colman & Dave, 2013). It may also cause her to
work harder in fear that her own job is in jeopardy. The effects of the local economy may be
termed the “external” effects of unemployment on health behavior. Naturally a higher local
unemployment rate may cause someone to lose her own job, which in turn will affect her health
behaviors, changes that may be termed the “internal” effects of unemployment. A change in the
local employment situation may affect households through both internal and external channels.
A number of recent studies have focused on the effect of local-area employment
conditions, with divergent results for most outcomes. Ruhm (2005) finds that obesity decreases
during recessions. Other studies find the reverse (for instance, Böckerman et al., 2007; Charles
& DeCicca, 2008; Latif, 2014), at least among certain segments of the population, and still others
find no effect (Nicholson & Simon, 2010). Most studies (Ruhm, 2005; Xu, 2013) find that an
increase area employment reduces the proportion of persons who exercise regularly. The results
with respect to smoking are less consistent. Ruhm (2005) and (Xu, 2013) find that increased

6

local-area employment increases smoking participation, while Charles and DeCicca (2008) find
that, among those least likely to be employed, smoking declines. Studies using European data
tend to find that a rise in local-area unemployment raises the probability of smoking and the
amount smoked (Öhlander, Vikström, Lindström, & Sundquist, 2006), though a study of the
recent Icelandic financial crisis finds a decrease in smoking (Ásgeirsdóttir et al., 2014). As noted
by Böckerman et al. (2007) and others, one reason results may differ between the U.S. and other
high-income countries is the more generous unemployment insurance available in those
countries, blunting the income effect of unemployment. Another reason is that the effect of the
recent crisis on the exchange rate, and hence on the price of food and tobacco, was much greater
outside the U.S., for example, in Iceland (Ásgeirsdóttir et al., 2014).
A distinct, older, and longer strand of the literature considers the effect of a person’s own
unemployment on health behaviors and obesity. Most studies find that unemployment raises
BMI (Leino-Arjas et al., 1999; Marcus, 2014; Virtanen et al., 2008) though some find no
statistically significant effect (Montgomery, Cook, Bartley, & Wadsworth, 1998); others find
that reduced (but still positive) hours of work lower BMI (Berniell, 2012; Courtemanche, 2009).
As in the studies using macro-level unemployment, in general own unemployment is associated
with a higher likelihood of exercise (Berniell, 2012; Leino-Arjas et al., 1999). In contrast to
macro-level studies, however, own unemployment is associated with a higher probability of
smoking (Bolton & Rodriguez, 2009; De Vogli & Santinello, 2005; Henkel, 2011; Marcus, 2014;
Novo et al., 2000) and of relapse (Falba et al., 2005).
We address several gaps and contribute to the literature along multiple dimensions. First,
we provide the first longitudinal evidence on the effects of unemployment on energy intake,
energy expenditure, and the net effect on BMI. Given the prior conflicting evidence on how

7

unemployment impacts BMI, examining behavioral pathways that affect bodyweight for the
same set of individuals over time is important towards assessing the plausibility of the BMI
effects. Second, in contrast to other, albeit limited set of longitudinal studies of unemployment
and health behaviors, our data sets span a much longer time period, spanning two recessions for
most of our outcomes and enveloping the recent Great Recession for all of them. The severity of
the Great Recession, in particular, provides an excellent opportunity to study behavioral impacts.
Job losers are more likely to adjust to an extended decline in income and increase in non-work
time, and hence change their behaviors, if they expect joblessness to last. Third, a number of the
important outcomes we study have been analyzed previously using only cross-sectional data,
essentially through comparisons of employed and unemployed persons, which limit a causal
interpretation and also limit a more deeper assessment of the composition of the effects (that is,
if recessions reduce smoking, cross-sectional data cannot reveal whether the change reflects light
smokers quitting or heavy smokers cutting back; effects of long-term vs. short-term job-loss). In
summary, we provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of how unemployment affects
health behaviors, exploiting longitudinal relationships and the large adverse shocks to labor
demand over the recent Great Recession.
III.

Analytical Framework
The question of how unemployment affects individuals’ health behaviors can be framed

within a human capital model for the demand for health.2 Individuals are assumed to maximize
utility, which is a function of their health and other broad commodities. Health behaviors can
indirectly affect utility through their effects on health, and may also directly affect utility as the
individual may find certain behaviors (for instance, smoking, fast food consumption, or
2

See Colman and Dave (2013) and Dave and Kelly (2012) for versions of this framework extended to specifically
study exercise and eating habits.

8

recreational exercise) inherently pleasurable or distasteful. Maximization occurs subject to a set
of constraints including a health production function, by which individuals produce health
investments by combining the various market and time inputs constituting the health behaviors; a
similar production function for other broad commodities; and constraints imposed by household
income and time endowments. Investments in health reduce time lost to illness and therefore
raise the total available time for other pursuits including work; this is the investment return to
health.
Unemployment may affect individuals’ health behaviors in this framework through
associated shifts in time and income constraints. These mechanisms affect both healthpromoting as well as health-depreciating behaviors. The decrease in labor supply due to
unemployment, and the subsequent easing of time-endowment constraints, is predicted to
increase behaviors which are relatively more intensive in time inputs, for instance activities such
as recreational exercise. Reduced household income due to job-loss may also raise the demand
for health behaviors which are inferior, such as smoking or fast food consumption, although
constrained budgets may also lead some smokers to reduce their cigarette consumption or quit
smoking altogether. Furthermore, lower household income may also lead to a substitution away
from health behaviors which are relatively more intensive in market inputs such as consuming
food outside the home. Increased stress or depression associated with job-loss (Classen & Dunn,
2012; Mandal, Ayyagari, & Gallo, 2011) may lead to a greater demand for health-depreciating
behaviors such as smoking or fast-food consumption, consistent with a “self-medication”
hypothesis (Dave & Kelly, 2012; Dave & Saffer, 2008). In addition, loss of healthcare coverage
associated with unemployment is predicted to have counteracting effects on health behaviors.
On the one hand, reduced contact with medical care professionals may increase (decrease)

9

participation in unhealthy (healthy) behaviors, though on the other hand, becoming uninsured
may also induce individuals to engage more in health-promoting behaviors in the context of an
ex-ante moral hazard effect (Dave & Kaestner, 2009) .
These mechanisms primarily capture the internal effects of unemployment, that is, effects
which are realized through the individual’s own job-loss.3 The upshot of this discussion is that
the net effects of unemployment on health behaviors are a priori indeterminate. Furthermore, we
expect that the effects would be heterogeneous across specific behaviors, partly due to the
various mechanisms at play, and partly due to the differences in the relative strength of the shifts
in time and income constraints interacting with differences in the relative intensity of time versus
market-based inputs across different behaviors.
III.

Methods
The objective of this study is to assess whether, and to what degree, job-loss has a causal

effect on health behaviors. To that purpose, we estimate the following model for the ith person
observed at time t:
(1)
where

is a vector of individual characteristics or behaviors that vary over time,

of individual characteristics that do not vary over time,
that reflects the respondent’s employment status, and

is the period effect,

is a vector

is an indicator

includes all time-varying unobserved

influences on the outcome.
The time varying controls,

, include the respondent’s age, marital status, state or

region of residence, month of interview, and, in some specifications, lagged self-reported health
3

To the extent that the individual’s job-loss is induced by, and thus also reflective of, the general economic
downturn over our analysis period, secondary external effects from the business cycle may also be at play. For
instance, expectations of prolonged job-loss due to the severity of the recent recession may lead to potentially
stronger shifts in health behaviors, as would any intra-household allocation of resources due to any individual
member’s job-loss.

10

status. The observable time-invariant controls,

, include gender, highest grade completed, race,

and ethnicity. In alternate specifications, we further include person-specific fixed effects, which
account for all unobserved time-invariant factors that differ across individuals, for instance lifecycle investments, family background, ability and aptitude, risk tolerance, and time preference.
We restrict the PSID sample to persons between the ages of 25 and 55, ages with the
highest labor force participation rates and therefore least likely to suffer from selection bias due
to unobserved factors affecting selection into the labor force instead of schooling and selection
out of the labor force due to retirement. The NLSY79 sample is by its nature restricted to persons
between the ages of 46 and 53 in 2010.
We use a number of alternate indicators of unemployment. The first simply equals one if
the respondent is unemployed. Of the different measures of unemployment, this variable is most
vulnerable to producing biased estimates. A person’s unemployment status may be correlated
with a number of time-varying unobserved factors that may also influence his health behaviors.
For example, perhaps a person’s health may decline and induce him to look for a different job
closer to home, and also to become less physically active, which is one of our outcomes of
interest.
Therefore we construct several other indicators of unemployment that are arguably less
likely to be correlated with the respondent’s unobserved characteristics. One is an indicator that
equals one if the respondent was unemployed due to being laid off, that is, let go because there
was insufficient demand for the company’s product or service or for some other reason that was
not the employee’s fault. The NLSY79 distinguishes between respondents who were laid off and
those who were fired. The PSID groups both together. Ideally we would exclude persons who
were fired, but since many more persons are laid off than fired, particularly in the current

11

recession, grouping them together should not severely bias the results. Being laid off is probably
not entirely exogenous to a worker’s characteristics. When they must lay off workers, companies
are likely first to release the least able. However, ability is constant from one wave of the survey
to the next, and hence would be removed by person fixed-effects.
Finally, we define an indicator that equals one if the respondent is unemployed because
his firm went out of business. This variable has been used by, among others, Salm (2009) and
Deb et al. (2011) to look at the effect of unemployment on health and certain health behaviors.
This indicator of unemployment is the one most plausibly exogenous to health behaviors since
relatively few respondents can have been the cause of their companies going out of business.
Thus the coefficient on this variable is arguably consistent, even without adding person fixedeffects.
In addition, for the NLSY only, we estimate models with different indicators of long-term
unemployment. These indicators equal one if the respondent has been unemployed for 13, 26,
and 52 weeks, respectively. The effect of long- versus short-term unemployment is likely to
matter for some outcomes more than others. For example, a person’s weight is unlikely to
change the very week he becomes unemployed. If unemployment does affect body weight, its
effect is likely to become apparent only for persons who have been unemployed for some time.
Other behavioral outcomes, however, such as going out to dinner, may respond immediately to
the loss of income following the start of unemployment.
The parameter of interest is , which captures the reduced-form effect of unemployment
on health behaviors operating through any and all competing and reinforcing channels. We first
estimate equation (1) using a random-effects specification as a baseline, which assumes that
uncorrelated with

is

. We test this assumption using a test of overidentifying restrictions

12

(Wooldridge, 2010). The null hypothesis is that the between-effects estimates of the coefficients
are statistically indistinguishable from the fixed-effects estimates, implying that
uncorrelated with

are

. Since the null hypothesis of this test is commonly rejected as unobserved

person-specific factors are likely to be correlated with the error term, we next estimate equation
(1) using person fixed-effects. This will produce consistent estimates of
weaker assumption that

is uncorrelated with

under the somewhat

, or, less formally, if a person’s labor force

status is unrelated to unobserved characteristics that change over time. One such confounding
variable is health, which may change how much physical activity a person engages in as well as
his labor force status. To control for this possibility, in alternative models we include lagged
measures of the respondent’s health. Further, to control for possible income effects, we include
in some models measures of the per capita income in the county of the respondent’s residence.
We restrict the analysis to respondents whose data are in at least two waves.4 Standard errors are
adjusted for arbitrary correlation in the error term for a given person over time.
IV.

Data

Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics began in 1968 as a nationally-representative
survey of about 4,800 families. It was conducted partly by the Census Bureau and partly by the
Survey Research Center (SRC) at the University of Michigan. Since then, the SRC has reinterviewed the original participants as well as their offspring when they form their own families,
or, in PSID terminology, “family units”. Re-interviews have been conducted every year through

4

STATA does not automatically do this when calculating fixed-effects coefficients. If one of the respondents
contributes only one year of data, converting that row to mean-difference form will produce a row of zeros.
Similarly, if a respondent has only two waves of data and his dependent and independent variables actually do not
change from one wave to the next, this will also create a row of zeros in mean-difference form. We view the
second example a legitimate row of zeros and a valid comparison group, whereas the first is not, and so we drop
persons with only one wave of data.

13

1997 and biennially since then. Response rates were above 95 percent until 1993 and have been
in the low 90s afterwards. As of 2009, the PSID includes about 9,000 families and 24,000
persons.
In each interview, one person answers all the questions for everyone in the family unit.
Usually, the respondent is the family unit “head”, the male in the family unit who is most
responsible for its financial decisions. His female domestic partner, if he has one, is designated
the “wife”, whether or not they are married. All the data in this study refer to the head or wife of
the family unit. Also, we consider data only from 1999 through 2009, because many of the
health-related variables are available continuously only during that period and because this time
span includes the two most recent recessions.
The PSID reports height and weight in each wave. From these, we compute the
respondent’s body-mass index (BMI) according to the standard formula.5 In addition to its effect
on mean BMI, we would like to assess the effect of unemployment on the distribution of BMI.
Therefore we create three dummy variables indicating “normal weight” (BMI between 18.5 and
25), “overweight” (BMI 25 and over but less than 30), and “obese” (BMI of 30 and above).
Some prior research, based on cross-sectional evidence, has found that not only does BMI
decline during recessions, but that it declines mainly among the overweight and obese (Ruhm
2005). We exploit the longitudinal information in our datasets and directly test this by estimating
the effect of unemployment on obesity only among persons who were overweight or obese
during the first wave in which they appeared in the sample. The disadvantage is that it creates a
sample based on the dependent variable, which can lead to biased estimates if the selection
depends on unobserved characteristics. Since many unobserved differences are removed by
5

2

BMI is computed as: (weight in kilograms)/(height in meters) . We exclude observations with calculated BMI
below 15 and above 70 to avoid possible recording errors.

14

fixed-effects methods, however, we expect to find, if bias is a problem, that fixed-effects and
random-effects models differ significantly, and in which case the fixed-effects estimates would
be more credible.
Since 1999, the PSID has asked questions on how often the respondent engages in light,
vigorous, or strength-building physical activity in his or her leisure time. The questions are,
respectively, “How often do you do light or moderate activities for at least 10 minutes that cause
only light sweating or slight to moderate increases in breathing or heart rate?”; “How often do
you do vigorous physical activities for at least 10 minutes that cause heavy sweating or large
increases in breathing or heart rate?”; and “How often do you do physical activities specifically
designed to strengthen your muscles such as lifting weights?”. From the responses to these
questions, we construct measures for the number of times per week that the respondent engaged
in the specified type of activity.6 Note that these variables refer to habitual physical activity
rather than physical activity in the past week, in contrast to the unemployment indicator, which
refers to the week of the interview.
Continuously since 1999, the PSID has asked participants about cigarette use. We
construct three measures based on the responses, an indicator for whether the respondent is a
current smoker, a continuous measure of the number of cigarettes smoked daily among smokers,
and another continuous measure of the number of cigarettes smoked daily among those who
smoked a pack or more of cigarettes per day in their first wave of the PSID since 1999, whom we
term “heavy smokers at entry”. We define this latter measure in order to explore whether
unemployment has a larger effect on smoking among initially heavy smokers than among
average smokers.

6

We set to missing the few observations whose reported values are greater than seven.

15

National Longitudinal Survey of Youth – 1979 Cohort (NLSY79)
The NLSY79 is a nationally representative sample of 12,686 young men and women who
were 14-22 years old when they were first surveyed in 1979. Due to deaths, attrition, and the
dropping of two subsamples, the total number of eligible respondents dropped to approximately
8,400 in 1998 and 7,700 in 2010. Participants were interviewed annually from 1979 to 1994, and
have been interviewed biennially since then.
Since 2006, the NLSY has not asked respondents their labor force status during the week
prior to the interview. Therefore, we use the information from the weekly labor force status
variables, which are based on retrospective information on the start and stop dates of the
respondents’ jobs and their activities while not working. For those unemployed, the NLSY asks
the reason that the respondent left his previous job. The responses include “fired”, “laid off”, and
“plant closed”, among others. We create an indicator that equals one if the respondent was
unemployed and was laid off from their previous job, and another that equals one if the
respondent was unemployed and his prior employer had gone out of business.
The NLSY asks questions on physical activity that are quite similar to those in the PSID,
which in turn are similar to those asked in the NHIS. The questions are, “How often do you do
vigorous activities for at least 10 minutes that cause heavy sweating or large increases in
breathing or heart rate?”; “How often do you do light or moderate activities for at least 10
minutes that cause only light sweating or slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate?”;
and “How often do you do physical activities specifically designed to strengthen your muscles
such as lifting weights or doing calisthenics?”. The key difference between the first two variables
and those in the PSID is that the NLSY does not restrict the reference to leisure-time activities.
That is, the questions on moderate and on vigorous activities refer to both work-related and

16

leisure-time physical activity, whereas those in the PSID are only in reference to leisure-time
activity. Given the substitution between work-related physical activity and leisure-time physical
activity associated with job-loss (Colman & Dave, 2013; Saffer, Dave, & Grossman, 2013), we
expect the effects of unemployment to differ on both of these sets of physical activity measures
from the PSID and the NLSY79. The NLSY also asks how many minutes the respondent spent
in each activity. We create variables measuring the number of minutes per week that the
respondent engaged in vigorous, and in light or moderate activities.7 The variable relating to
strength-building activity does refer to leisure time. Thus we expect to find that unemployment
has a similar effect on this measure as it does on the physical activity measures in the PSID.
The NLSY collects information on weight in every round but on height only in 1981,
1982, 1985, and 2006 onwards. For the years 1998 through 2004 we use the average of the
heights reported in 1985 and 2006. We calculate BMI as in the PSID.8
Since 2002 the NLSY has asked each respondent, “About how long has it been since your
last general physical exam or routine checkup by a medical doctor or other health professional?
Do not include a visit about a specific problem.” We create a dummy that equals one if the
respondent has not had a physical for over a year, as an indicator of routine, preventive
healthcare utilization.
For 2008 and 2010, questions have been asked about diet. Specifically, the NLSY asks:
“In the past seven days, how many times did you eat food from a fast food restaurant such as
McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, or Taco Bell?” Parallel questions are asked
about the frequency of snacks, skipping meals, and consuming a soft drink. We create

7

We set to missing the few values above 3360 minutes (8 hours times 60 minutes times 7 days a week).
In alternate specifications, we adjust reported BMI for potential measurement and reporting errors based on
objectively-measured BMI from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, as described in Cawley
(2004). Reported estimates below are not sensitive to this correction.

17

continuous measures of the number of times per week that the respondent engages in each of
these activities.
For both the PSID and the NLSY we construct and control for indicators for educational
attainment (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, college or more), race and
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic), marital
status (never married, married, divorced, separated, widowed), region or state of residence, and
month (to capture seasonal effects on health behaviors). Age is left as a continuous variable.9

Tables 1 and 2 report means for the PSID sample. Our central results for the PSID are
evident in these tables. Among PSID participants, the unemployment rate rose by two percentage
points from 1999 to 2003, and by 4 percentage points from 2007 to 2009, yet in neither span of
time did leisure-time exercise rise significantly. In fact, the trend in exercise was downward
throughout the period. Similarly, neither BMI nor the percent obese changed appreciably during
recessionary periods, or to put it differently, the strength or weakness of the economy had no
effect on the upward trend in both indicators of body weight. The number of cigarettes smoked
among smokers, however, declined in both recessionary periods, while the share of the sample
that smoked trended downward throughout the sample period.
9

All means and regressions are unweighted. In regression analysis weights are unnecessary when they are
functions of exogenous variables included in the models. The original PSID oversampled low-income families. We
cannot include income as a covariate because it depends on employment status, our key covariate. Instead, we
control for the factors that have been found to be correlated with income, such as age, education, ethnicity,
experience, and marital status. The NLSY originally included oversamples of persons with low incomes and also
persons serving in the military, but these subsamples were dropped in waves prior to those we use in this study. In
any case, the variables used to construct weights, with the exception of sample attrition, are constant over time,
and thus fall out of our fixed-effects models. For completeness, we compared the coefficients from weighted and
unweighted fixed-effects models, and found no statistically significant differences. Similarly, the weighted and
unweighted coefficients from the maximum likelihood random effects models did not differ significantly.

18

Before turning to the regression results we first consider the exogeneity of the different
reasons for unemployment. Some information on this is given in Tables 2 and 5. Ideally, to find
the effect of unemployment on behavior, workers would be out of work completely randomly. If
the world worked this way, the characteristics of the unemployed, laid off, and those who have
lost their job due to a plant closing would be the same, within sampling error. But as Table 2
suggests, this is not so. All three categories of the unemployed contain more persons of color,
high school dropouts, obese, unmarried, and heavy smokers than the population in general. Thus
even though a plant-closing is exogenous with respect to the worker, it does not happen to a
random subsample of the population. Hence plant closings alone will likely not identify the
average treatment effect of unemployment on behavior. This highlights the importance of using
fixed-effects to control for the many unmeasurable differences between the employed and
unemployed, at least differences that are constant over time. Table 5 also shows that during the
current recession, the unemployed became more similar to the general population of workers.
That is, relative to those who are generally unemployed or laid off or affected by a plant closing
in 2005, those in similar categories in 2009 are less likely to be persons of color, high school
dropouts, obese, unmarried, and heavy smokers. This highlights the benefits of data that cover
recessions when the goal is to learn the effect of unemployment.
Models based on the PSID are presented in Tables 6 (for females) and 7 (for males). The
PSID regressions, shown in Table 6, confirm the correlations evident in the means. We estimate
separate models for men and women because recessions generally, and the current recession
especially, reflect greater contractions in industries, such as construction and durable
manufacturing, in which men constitute a larger share of workers. Most likely for this reason,
unemployment generally has a larger effect among men than women.

19

Among women, becoming unemployed generally raises the probability of smoking, by
about 3 to 4 percentage points in the random-effects models, and about 2 percentage points in the
fixed-effects models for being laid-off. The stronger random-effects results probably reflect the
higher share of smokers among the unemployed, rather than a causal effect. Since few persons
start to smoke after age 25, which is the minimum age in our sample, the 2 percentage point
change in the fixed-effects model reflects relapse and/or a reduction in the likelihood of quitting
smoking due to the stress of unemployment. There is some suggestive evidence, based on
women who lost their jobs due to their firm closing, that cigarette consumption among those who
were heavy smokers at baseline may have declined, which may directly income constraints as
well as potential intra-household reallocation of resources from reduced household income.10
We do not find consistent or significant effects on other health behaviors.
Among men, becoming unemployed has no consistent effect on vigorous leisure time
exercise. This is not surprising since those who exercise vigorously when employed are
committed to exercise, and will likely continue to exercise when unemployed. In fact, becoming
unemployed may reduce vigorous exercise, since such exercisers may be more likely than others
to pay for membership at a gym or health club, which becomes less affordable after a job loss. In
contrast, unemployment slightly increases the amount of light exercise, with the effect consistent
across reasons for unemployment, though the effect is significant only for “Laid off”.
Becoming unemployed is associated with a consistent but only marginally significant
increase in the BMI of men who were obese at baseline. This contrasts with Ruhm (2005), but
accords with Charles and DeCicca (2008), Nicholson and Simon (2010), and Böckerman et al.
(2007). We discuss the effects on obesity further on when we discuss the results from the NLSY.
10

Reduced smoking at the intensive margin, among prior heavy smokers, may also reflect increased uncertainty
regarding finding another job and a subsequent downward revision of expected future income.

20

The largest effects in the table pertain to cigarettes smoked among smokers.
Unemployment reduces the number of cigarettes smoked among smokers by 5 to 10 percent
among males, though the effect is significant only at the 10 percent level. The effect is twice as
large and consistently significant among those who were heavy smokers in the first wave.
Similar to the effect for women, this is likely an income effect associated with job-loss, since
many workplaces restrict smoking on premises, so being at home rather than at a workplace
would tend to increase the amount smoked. In addition, heavy smokers tend to earn less than
other smokers, and hence would respond more to job loss.

NLSY79 Estimates
As with the PSID data, the means of the NLSY sample, shown in Tables 3 and 4,
prefigure our regression results. The frequency of strength-building exercise, the only measure of
exercise in the NLSY that specifically refers to leisure-time activity, is unchanged over the
sample period. Total moderate or heavy physical activity, however, drops substantially from
2006 to 2010. Purchases of fast food, soft drinks, consumption of snacks, and the number of
skipped meals decline, but since we have only two years of data on these variables, not much can
be learned just from the means.
The regression results from the NLSY, in Tables 7 and 8, show no significant or
consistent effect of unemployment on women’s total physical activity, including both work- and
leisure-time, which is expected, since in general their jobs are not as physically demanding as
men’s. In contrast, men’s total physical activity declines substantially. Vigorous activity declines
by about 2 hours per week, and moderate activity, by about an hour to an hour and a half. This is

21

consistent with the large decline in jobs in construction and manufacturing, which tend to be
physically demanding (Colman & Dave, 2013).
These results reflect that women are much less likely to have a physically demanding job
than men. Unemployment has a similar effect on strength-building activities in the NLSY as it
does on the leisure-time activities in the PSID, that is, none. Note that strength-building is solely
a leisure-time activity in both the NLSY and the PSID. The effect, however, on total physical
activity, moderate or heavy, which includes both leisure- and work-related exertion, is quite
pronounced. Unemployment reduces moderate or vigorous physical activity by roughly an hour
to an hour and a half per week. This accords with the findings of Colman and Dave (2013) ,
which used the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). While job-loss reduces time constraints,
the freed-up time is generally allocated towards more sedentary activities; hence, the loss of
physical activity from work for those which physically-demanding jobs is not compensated from
the increase in these other activities, causing total physical activity to decline.
Unemployment reduces the number of fast-food meals respondents eat by about half a
meal per week, which is significant across most models and reasons for unemployment. One
question is whether this reflects mainly the effect of unemployment on time available or on
income. We attempt to parse the income effect using three measures of income, all adjusted for
inflation: the respondent’s own family income, the per capita income in the respondent’s county
residence, and the per capita transfers in the respondent’s county of residence. The latter two
measures, from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, were chosen because they are likely
correlated with the respondent’s own income but arguably not with his or her unmeasured
characteristics that affect fast-food consumption. The inclusion of income as an additional
independent variable had no effect on the coefficient on unemployment, regardless of the

22

measure of income used. Thus we tentatively infer that the reduced consumption of fast-foods
reflects the greater availability of time for cooking rather than less income available to purchase
the fast-food. This is supported by data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which
show that the time spent on meal preparation is positively correlated with the unemployment rate
in respondents’ states. In other words, “fast food” is what its name implies, fast, which is
important to workers with little spare time, but it is not actually cheap compared with cooking at
home, a point made in an editorial by a food columnist for the New York Times.11 Some
confirmation of this point is available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which reports that
inflation-adjusted sales of fast-food restaurants fell slightly from 2008 to 2010, though the
decline was much less than that of full-service restaurants. Over the same period, real sales of
food consumed at home rose. These changes are consistent with a shift among consumers
towards preparing more meals at home.
The estimates in Table 10 and 11 (for females and males, respectively) consider
differential effects based on the duration of unemployment. In addition to actual job-loss, health
behaviors may also respond to expectations about the duration of job-loss and prospects of
finding other work. There may be little behavioral effects if job-losers expect soon to be reemployed, whereas if they expect joblessness to last, they will adjust to a possibly prolonged
decline in income and increase in non-working time. Thus, the channels discussed above are
expected to become more pronounced with the duration of unemployment.
For both males and females, there is some evidence of stronger negative effects on
moderate daily physical activity as well as fast-food consumption with longer unemployment.
The results do not show any consistently stronger effects on BMI with prolonged job-loss,

however, which suggests that the null to weak BMI effects are driven by the counteracting
effects of reduced physical activity associated with reduced caloric intake. The results also
indicate that being unemployed for longer periods of time is associated with a greater likelihood
of delaying a physical exam. This suggests that loss of healthcare coverage and the negative
income effect may outweigh any positive effects of reduced time constraints. Additionally, this
may also reflect a displacement effect, wherein individuals are delaying healthcare utilization
until they have a job and healthcare coverage.
One issue that arises, and which has generally been bypassed in the prior literature as it
cannot be investigated with cross-sectional data, relates to potential compositional selection from
inter-state migration. That is, individuals living in communities facing prolonged contraction of
key industries may relocate to other states with better job prospects. These individuals who face
prolonged job-loss and choose to relocate are not necessarily a random subset of all unemployed
individuals, and hence may differ along unobserved characteristics that would also be correlated
with their health behaviors. Barsky, Kimball, Juster, and Shapiro (1997) found, for instance, that
migrant individuals are likely to be more risk-tolerant. To the extent that risk-tolerance would
also be associated with greater engagement in unhealthy behaviors, such selection would be
expected to provide upward biased effects of unemployment on healthy behaviors.12 On the
other hand, studies have also found some evidence of a healthy-migrant effect within the US and
other countries (for instance, Lu, 2008; Wingate & Alexander, 2006). Such health-based
selection into migration would provide downward biased effects of unemployment on healthy
behaviors. We exploit the longitudinal information from both the PSID and NLSY to assess the
robustness of the above estimates to accounting for inter-state migration. Specifically, we re12

Dave & Saffer (2008), for instance, find that greater risk tolerance raises alcohol consumption among older
adults.

24

estimate all models for a subset of individuals who did not move across states, and alternately a
subset of individuals who did not move at all over the sample period. The estimates from these
alternate samples, specifically the fixed-effects estimates, were generally robust to those
discussed above, indicating the value of using longitudinal data and suggesting that any
systematic selection into migration across or within states is generally purged by the personspecific fixed effects.13
VI.

Discussion
This study provides a comprehensive look at how health behaviors respond due to actual

job-loss over the business cycle, providing some of the first longitudinal evidence on the internal
effects of unemployment for several key behaviors spanning two recessions, including the recent
Great Recession. We also provide the first study of the effect of unemployment on physical
activity (energy expenditure), food consumption (energy intake), and the net effect (BMI) among
the same sample of persons over time. This is particularly valuable in studying BMI, since prior
research on the effects of unemployment on BMI has either found no or small effects. On the one
hand, the true effect on BMI, if it exists, may be too small to measure reliably. On the other
hand, a null or small effect may also imply counteracting effects on caloric intake and
expenditure. Hence, there is value in analyzing a combination of behavioral inputs (physical
activity and food consumption) into BMI, which may respond more readily to job-loss and also
help place prior BMI results in context.
One interpretation of our joint results of physical activity, fast-food consumption, and
BMI is that both energy intake and expenditure decline after a job loss, leaving BMI unchanged
or only slightly higher (mostly among previously obese individuals), even with prolonged jobloss. Our findings do not contradict results using data from European countries (e.g. Böckerman
13

Results are not reported, and available upon request.

25

et al., 2007), which consistently find that unemployment raises BMI. European countries have
much more generous unemployment insurance programs than the U.S. According to the OECD,
on average U.S. unemployment insurance replaces about 13 percent of gross compensation,
whereas European countries typically replace three times that. Thus the income shock from jobloss in Europe is much less than here, while the drop in physical activity could well be similar,
causing an increase in BMI in Europe but not in the U.S.
There is also some suggestive evidence for other health behaviors, particularly smoking
and forgoing a physical. While prior work on the effects of job-loss and area unemployment on
smoking has been mixed, the longitudinal evidence in this study suggests that this may be due to
heterogeneity across various margins as well as across the smoking distribution. Among
females, we find that the smoking effects are somewhat heterogeneous at the intensive and
extensive margins. While job-loss is associated with an increase in the probability of being a
current smoker, consistent with a decline in smoking cessation or a relapse into smoking among
former smokers due to stress, we also find that those who were heavy smokers at baseline tend to
somewhat reduce their cigarette consumption, consistent with an income effects. Among males,
there is generally no significant effect on smoking at the extensive margin, though similar to
females, we find a reduction in cigarettes consumed particularly among heavy smokers.
We underscore that the effects in this study are reflective of the first-order internal effects
of job-loss, that is effects realized due to actual job-loss, as opposed to the second-order external
effects which are realized even if the individual does not lose their job.14 The weight of the
evidence from these estimates shows that the effects of job-loss on health behaviors are complex
and multi-faceted, and cannot necessarily be reduced to broad generalizations along the form of
14

Prior studies which have estimated reduced-form specifications linking area unemployment to health outcomes
and behaviors conflate both internal and external effects (for instance, Colman & Dave, 2013; Dave & Kelly, 2012;
Ruhm, 2003).

26

job-loss leading individuals to engage in more or less healthy lifestyles. As different behaviors
vary in terms of their relative intensity of time versus market-purchased inputs, they would
respond differently to shifts in resource constraints associated with job-loss. Furthermore, stress
due to job-loss and expectations regarding prolonged duration of job-loss would also elicit
different responses with respect to the various behaviors. At the same time, however, prior work
has shown that physical activity can be health-promoting, conditional on a given BMI (Colman
& Dave, 2013; Surgeon General, 1996). Thus, even though unemployment is only weakly
associated with BMI, the lower total physical activity may have adverse effects on health, as may
delaying routine healthcare visits.

Notes: Each cell represents a separate regressions model. Fixed-effects models control for age, marital status, state of residence, and month. Random-effects additionally control
for gender, highest grade completed, race, and Hispanic origin. Standard errors, adjusted for arbitrary correlation within individual cells over time, are reported in parentheses.
Asterisks denote significance as follows: *significant at 10% level; **significant at 5% level; ***significant at 1% level
+ random-effects model rejected at 5% level (i.e. panel effects are correlated with independent variables)
