ABSTRACT
We exploit a series of discontinuities, at several population thresholds, in the allocation
mechanism of federal transfers to municipal governments in Brazil to identify the causal effect of
municipal spending on local labor markets, using a â€˜fuzzyâ€™ regression discontinuity design. Our
estimates imply a cost per job of about 8; 000 US dollars per year, mostly driven by employment
in services, and a local income multiplier of around two. A currency union model with nominal
rigidities and liquidity constraints implies that the stimulative effects would have been
substantially smaller if local government spending was financed by local tax revenues rather than
regional transfers.

1 Introduction
The ongoing political crisis in the Euro-area has brought the design of scal policy to the
front stage of the public debate, generating renewed interest in policy and academic circles on
the role of regional transfers in large currency unions (Farhi and Werning, 2016, Nakamura
and Steinsson, 2014). This debate goes back to the early contributions of Robert Mundell
(1961, 1973) and Peter Kennen (1971). Besides important theoretical issues, there is limited
applied research quantifying the impact of regional transfers on local economies inside a
currency union.

1

In this paper we examine the impact of transfers-driven municipal expenditure on local
labor markets in Brazil, where municipal receipts of federal transfers change abruptly at numerous pre-determined population thresholds, allowing for a `fuzzy' Regression Discontinuity
Design (RDD). While municipalities belonging to the same population bracket receive the
same amount of transfers in a given year and state from the federal government, municipalities with a few inhabitants above (below) the upper (lower) bound of each bracket receive, on
average,

20%

more (less). Hence, population uctuations around the legislated cutos pro-

vide locally exogenous variation to identify the causal eects of externally-nanced municipal
government spending on economic activity. Our analysis exploits variation from more than

3, 000

municipalities over the period

1999 âˆ’ 2014

using high-quality microdata covering the

bulk of private and municipal public sector employment contracts. The focus on numerous
small geographical units over time allows controlling for time-invariant municipal factors, related to geography, history, local cultural and institutional features, and for country-wide and
state trends, related to monetary policy, federal scal policy, and business cycles. This contrasts favorably with empirical studies on government spending at the national level, where
aggregate confounding factors are harder to net out. The focus on regional transfers allows
us to draw a distinction between external and internal sources of public nance, a critical
issue for policy making (see Ramey (2016) and Chodorow-Reich (2016)).

In this regard,

we calibrate Farhi and Werning (2016) currency union model with regional trade, nominal
rigidities, and liquidity constraints and contrast our fuzzy-RD estimates to the counterfactual
that would have emerged if municipal spending was funded by local tax revenues rather than
regional transfers, as in our set up.

1 Chodorow-Reich

(2017) summarizes some recent empirical studies that we discuss below.

Results Preview.

Our analysis yields ve main ndings. First, changes in local govern-

ment expenditure stemming from `locally' exogenous shifts in federal transfers are associated
with a signicant boost in local private and public sector employment. A USD

30, 000

in-

crease in municipal spending is associated with an extra job in the local public sector and
three extra jobs in the private sector, implying a cost per job of about

7, 500 âˆ’ 8, 000 USD per

year. Second, the eect on wages in muted; pre-existing employees in the public sector experience a modest pay rise, whereas compensation per worker in the private sector is not aected.
Third, most of the private sector employment response comes from services, a result in line
with theoretical works stressing the stimulative eects of local spending and regional transfers on non-tradeables (e.g., Farhi and Werning, 2016). Fourth, a simple production function
mapping of the fuzzy-RD employment eects into income yields local income multipliers in
the range of

1.6 to 2.4 (Chodorow-Reich, 2016).

Fifth, our counterfactual simulations using a

workhorse New-Keynesian currency-union model predict that the estimated multiplier would
have been between

0.8

and

1.4

if local government spending was nanced instead by local

tax revenues. Sixth, the eects of regional transfers are somewhat larger in more developed
Southern states and in smaller municipalities.

Related Literature.

Our work is related to the recent literature that examines the

impact of government spending on local economic outcomes by exploiting cross-sectional
2

variation.

Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) interact state-level military procurement and

spending with country-level changes in military build-ups to identify the impact of scal
shocks on state output. Shoag (2013) uses variation in the idiosyncratic component of U.S.
states' portfolio of dened-benet pension plan asset returns as an `instrument' for local
spending. Serrato and Wingender (2016) exploit federal spending reallocations across U.S.
counties driven by unanticipated revisions to local population estimates to identify the effects of county-level government spending.

Becker, Egger and von Ehrlich (2010, 2013) examine the medium-run growth eects

of EU structural fund grants, documenting positive but quite heterogeneous eects.
We share with these recent studies the geographic cross-sectional approach and the effort to push on causation via exploiting some form of "quasi-random" variation. Our rst
contribution is to provide evidence on the impact of local scal policy in a large emerging
market against the backdrop of an empirical literature dominated by estimates for the United
States and some other advanced economies, like Italy and Japan (Notable exceptions are the
cross-country works of Kraay, 2012, 2014).

4

Moreover, we examine the impact of direct trans-

fers from the federal government to localities rather than swings on local spending from an
exogenous shock, like military buildup or higher stock returns. Second, building on advances
in labor economics (Angrist and Lavy, 2001; van der Klaauw, 2002; Hahn, Todd and Van der
Klaauw, 2001) we apply a new in applied macroeconomics `fuzzy' regression discontinuity
approach to identify the eects of local scal policy.

5

In this regard our work connects with

empirical works in political economy that examine the eect of federal transfers in Brazil on
various political outcomes applying RD methods (Ferraz and Finan, 2010; Brollo, Nannicini,
Perotti and Tabellini, 2013; Litschig and Morrison, 2013, Gadenne, 2016). Third, we nest our
RD estimates in a canonical currency union model to approximate the impact of municipal
spending if it was funded via local taxes rather than outside (federal in our application) transfers. This is important both because it allows quantifying the impact of regional transfers
in currency unions against a reasonable counterfactual and because it connects the paper's
results to the broader literature on the eects of government spending on aggregate economic
activity (Farhi and Werning, 2016; Ramey, 2016).

2 Institutional Framework and Data
2.1 The FPM Transfers Scheme
The Federative Republic of Brazil is organized at three levels of government:
union,

26 states and 1 federal district, and 5, 565 municipalities.

the federal

The executive and legislative

powers are organized independently at all three levels, while the judiciary is organized at the
federal and state level. Municipal governments are managed by an elected mayor (Prefeito)
and an elected council (Camara dos Vereadores), which are in charge of a signicant portion of public goods provision, related to education, health, and small-scale infrastructure.

6

Brazilian municipalities have limited ability to raise taxes, which on average correspond to
only

6%

of total revenues in our sample of municipalities with less than

50, 000

inhabitants.

Municipalities are highly dependent on transfers from the states and the federal government.
A major role is played by an automatic federal scal transfer scheme - the Fundo de ParticipaÃ§Ã£o dos Municipios (FPM). FPM is the largest program of transfers to municipalities

The pool of

of total revenues raised through the federal

income tax and the industrial products tax.
The FPM was introduced in

1965

as a constitutional amendment by the military govern-

ment to distribute resources in an orderly and transparent fashion (and weaken local political
elites). The allocation mechanism was shaped by subsequent legislation in
and was rectied by the Federal Constitution of

1988

1981 (decree 1881)

(Art. 159 Ib). Since then, there have

been no changes.
In each year, FPM funds are allocated to municipalities according to a predetermined
mechanism that relies on local population estimates and the state which the municipality
belongs to.

First, a xed share of total FPM funds is assigned to each of the

26

states.

Second, each municipality is assigned a coecient depending on pre-specied population
brackets. Let

There are two interesting features of the FPM allocation mechanism. First, municipalities
in the same bracket (in a given year and state) should get the exact same amount of transfers, independently of the exact number of inhabitants. Second - and most importantly for
our identication - federal transfers change discontinuously at the cutos. For instance, the

8 The state shares of FPM transfers (reported in Appendix Table 1) are based on population/output per
capita in 1991 and have not been altered ever since. The FPM formula applies to all municipalities with
population less than approximately 150 thousand inhabitants that are not state capitals.

population bracket or move across brackets by year and by cuto, respectively. Almost all
movements are either to the immediately higher (+1) or immediately lower (âˆ’1) population
brackets.

The larger number of positive jumps should not come as a surprise, as during

the sample period Brazil experienced considerable population growth (1.1% per annum on
average). Most of the upward or downward jumps regard cities falling within thresholds
(up to

27, 169).

There are fewer movements around thresholds

yet the number of

jumps in any population bracket relative to the number of observations is roughly constant.

2.3 Data and Summary Statistics
Municipal public nances are retrieved from the FINBRA database and FPM transfers from
the National Treasury.

11

Population estimates are provided by the IBGE. Our main source for

local labor market outcomes (income and employment) is the

Sociais (RAIS), spanning over

1999 âˆ’ 2014.12

yearly by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor.

RelaÃ§Ã£o Anual de InformaÃ§Ãµes

This is an administrative dataset assembled

Eectively, this is a high-quality census of the

Brazilian formal labor market that contains detailed contractual information on 26.2 million
workers of a universe of 27.6 million in 2000, according to the census, and on all 2.2 million
registered rms (De Negri

et al., 2001; Saboia and Tolipan, 1985; Amorim et al, 2006).

We aggregate earnings and employment information at the municipal level separately by
private or public sector (local government only), and according to job tenure and sector
of the economy. Providing accurate information in RAIS is required for workers to receive
payments from government benet programs and rms face nes for failing to report.

and local expenditure. For income per capita only, we present average values (retrieved from

http://www.tesouro.fazenda.gov.br/pt_PT/contas-anuais
12 While data on municipal GDP are available at yearly frequency from IBGE over our sample period
(see Corbi, Papaioannou and Surico, 2014), they are not observed but estimated based on past surveys and
censuses. This makes the use of municipal GDP as measure of local economic activity unattractive for our
purpose for two reasons. First, it does not capture yearly changes in the sectorial structure of local economies,
keeping the share of each industry constant across years, which is particularly worrysome in a set up that
exploits within-variation. Second, these historical data are also used to calculate the population estimates
and would introduce a mechanical link between the running variable (population) and the outcomes.
13 RAIS covers nearly all formally employed workers with a signed work-card, providing access to benets
and oering legal labor protection rights. It omits interns, in-house workers and other minor employment
categories. Self-employed and independent professionals recruiting employees are also included (Dix-Carneiro
and Kovak, 2015b). These data have been used by Dix-Carneiro (2014), Helpman, Itskhoki, Muendler and
Redding (2017), Krishna et al. (2014), Lopes de Melo (2013), and Menezes-Filho and Muendler (2011).

Turning to spending, the main

categories are Local Administration (16%), Education (33%), Health (22%) and Housing &
Urban Infrastructure (9%). There are institutional constraints preventing municipalities for
borrowing and overspending, so local governments virtually run balanced budgets.

3 Identication
In this section we rst describe the fuzzy regression discontinuity design that allows us to
isolate the eect of municipality spending driven by regional transfers on local labor markets
outcomes. Then we discuss and present supportive evidence of the identifying assumptions.

14 While

municipal GDP is available at yearly frequency from IBGE (see Corbi, Papaioannou and Surico,
2014), these data are not directly measured but estimated using historical surveys and censi. This is unattractive for our purpose for two main reasons. First, the construction of the municipal GDP estimates assume
that the share of each industry in the local economy remains constant across years. This is particularly
worrisome in a set up that exploits within-municipality variation. Second, these historical surveys and censis
are also used to estimate municipal population, thereby introducing a mechanical link between the running
variable (local population) and the potential outcome (local GDP).
15 This disparity reects bigger cities' higher income. For example, income per capita Sao Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro, which account for almost 20% of the country's population, was around BRL 18, 900 in 2013.
16 More specically, the median (average) surplus is only 0.1% (0.2%) of municipal GDP.

3.1 Empirical Framework: Fuzzy RD Design
3.1.1 Source of Exogenous Variation
The allocation of FPM transfers to municipal governments is a non-linear function of population. While level and changes in population are likely to depend on local economic conditions
and other hard-to-observe factors, federal transfers change abruptly at several pre-determined
population thresholds.

Hence population movements around the cutos can be used as a

source of locally exogenous variation to estimate the causal eects of regional transfers on
labor market outcomes in the neighborhood of thresholds (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). In
Figure 3a, we plot actual FPM transfers against population. The solid (red) vertical lines

Small dots represent

Thick (black) lines denote running-mean smoothing over

There are visible jumps when population crosses the

FPM cutos. There is also considerable variability, as total FPM funds have grown over time
and because of non-negligible dierences in FPM funds across states.
Federal transfers are not shaped exclusively by the FPM allocation mechanism.

This

mis-assignment of funds has many causes, from simple misreporting to the fact that throughout the 1990s some municipalities split into two, but (temporarily) kept their former FPM

Law-implied transfers are the exact amount each municipality

would have received if the allocation mechanism was perfectly enforced; hence the sharper
jumps at the seven FPM cutos.

3.1.2 Empirical Specications
If actual FPM transfers are the only relevant factor that change discontinuously at the cutos,
we can estimate the impact of locally exogenous movements of municipalities across population thresholds on labor market outcomes by running variants of the following specications

Following Angrist and Lavy (1999), Hahn, Todd and Van

der Klaauw (2001), van der Klaauw (2002), and subsequent works in a similar context to
ours (e.g., Brollo, Nannicini, Tabellini, and Perotti (2013)), we combine the estimation of
the rst-stage and the reduced-form specications in an Instrumental Variable (IV) set-up,
which isolates the eects on local labor market conditions of locally exogenous changes in
federal transfers, stemming from the enforceability of the law, close to the FPM cutos.

mechanism) in each year.
We estimate two variants of this specication, which restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the seven cutos using three bandwidths (h

= 4%, 3%

and

2%).20

First, we

estimate simple OLS (reduced-form) and IV (fuzzy-RD) models without including any RD
polynomials. This approach is transparent, simple and straightforward to implement (Angrist and Lavy, 1999). However, it may yield imprecise estimates, as the bandwidth narrows,
and not account well for dierences in population when the bandwidth is wide. Second, we
estimate "local regressions" with a "rectangular kernel". These models include cuto-specic
linear RD polynomials on normalized population, allowing for dierent slopes of the "running
variable" for municipalities below and above the discontinuities.

use of relative size neighborhood as opposed to absolute is due to the fact that the number of
municipalities decrease in population size. In order not to lose too many observations as we narrow the sample,
we allow neighbourhoods to grow with population as in Litschig and Morrison (2012). For example, consider
the rst and fourth cuto (10, 188 and 23, 772). A 2%-neighbourhood include 1, 141 and 801 observations,
respectively. If we were to use an absolute neighbourhoods of 200 inhabitants, we would have 1, 139 and 360
observations, further decreasing the weight of larger municipalities.

13

The simplicity of the FPM mechanism and the fact that transfers within a state and
year depend only on population estimates render this setup ideal for our purpose.

22

Another

attractive feature of the FPM law is the presence of many discontinuities. Thus our results
are not subject to the usual critique of RDD estimates that, since the identied eects are
local, they may not apply far from the discontinuity. It would seem of some interest to point
it out that, unlike earlier contributions exploiting the allocation of federal resources across
municipalities in Brazil to study other outcomes, our design makes the identication strategy
particularly strong. By exploiting within-municipality variation, we account for unobserved
features, something key as in a large and heterogeneous country, municipalities dier across
many dimensions.
We report heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the micro-region level,
which the IBGE denes as "groups

and structure of production ".23

of economically integrated municipalities sharing borders

This approach accounts for residual auto-correlation and

spatial spillovers across nearby municipalities with economic links. This adjustment yields
more conservative estimates as standard errors are larger as compared to simply clustering
at the municipality level or the state level.

3.2 Identifying Assumptions
Our RD design relies on four main identifying assumptions, which we discuss below.

3.2.1 Federal Transfers at the Discontinuities
A

sine qua non requirement is that FPM transfers change when municipalities cross FPM

population thresholds. While fuzzy-RD does not require that the law is perfectly enforced,
there has to be some enforcement.

This is akin to the `strong rst-stage-t' assumption

in classical two-stage least squares.

Figure

rectangular kernel, but verify the robustness of the results to dierent choices of bandwidth ". Lee and Lemieux
(2010) argue that it is "more transparent to just estimate standard linear regressions (rectangular kernel) with
a variety of bandwidths, instead of trying out dierent kernels corresponding to particular weighted regressions
that are more dicult to interpret ". For completeness, however, we also report in the specications using
all observations (both far and close to discontinuities) and conditioning on high-order RD polynomials (as
Brollo, Nannicini, Tabellini and Perotti, 2013), obtaining similar results (Appendix Table 16).
22 Indeed, Eggers, Freier, Grembi and Nannicini (2016) argue that "population-threshold RDD may be the
best available research design for studying the eects of certain policies ".
23 See IBGE (1990, page 10). Our sample comprises 547 micro-regions with an average of 21 micro-regions
per state and 5 municipalities per micro-region.

transfers is enforced, though even with averaged-data there is evidence of mis-assignment.
In Table

shaping FPM allocations is enforced.

Besides log specications, we also report models in

levels, exactly as dictated by the law.

24

The estimates in row (1) show that - in line with

the allocation mechanism - there is an almost one-to-one relationship between law-implied
and actual transfers. The coecient remains stable as we narrow the bandwidth. The same
applies when use the logarithm of actual and law-implied transfers (row (2)). We also estimate least-absolute deviation (median) regressions to account for outliers. The coecient

same applies when we estimate the specications in rst-dierences, though these models come with
an eciency loss (Appendix Table 5). The OLS and LAD specications yield estimates of 1, while the log
dierence models yield somewhat attenuated elasticities of around 0.94. We also examined the link between

3.2.2 Municipal Government Revenues and Expenditure
A related necessary condition for identication is that municipal revenues and expenditure
change abruptly at the cutos.
Table

4 - Panel A reports level and log-OLS estimates with municipality xed-eects and

LAD estimates without xed-eects of law-implied FPM transfers on municipal revenues.
Columns (2)-(4) estimates are reasonably stable and move closer to
width. When we add the

1 as we narrow the band-

1st -order RD polynomial in columns (5)-(7),

the OLS estimates fall

and become somewhat imprecise (0.6âˆ’0.78). LAD estimates that account for outliers remain
in the range of

0.9âˆ’1.1.

Log-OLS results are also stable with point estimates not statistically

dierent from the share of FPM in municipal revenues (0.31, Table

2).

Figure 5a provides a

graphical illustration of these estimates when we pool across all cutos. There is an evident
jump of municipal revenues for municipalities on the right of the pooled discontinuities.
Table

- Panel

B

reports corresponding estimates for municipal expenditure. OLS and

LAD estimates in columns (2)-(4) are close to

1.

While the estimates fall when we add the

cuto-specic constants and linear polynomials, we cannot reject a coecient of unity. LogOLS estimates are around

0.30,

close to the share of FPM transfers to municipal spending.

Figure 5b plots average municipal expenditure below and above the pooled discontinuities.
While relatively more noisy than FPM transfers, municipal spending visibly changes discontinuously across the cutos.

26

3.2.3 Other Sources of Municipal Revenues around the FPM Thresholds
Another condition for identication is that, besides FPM transfers, no other relevant for labor
markets covariates move abruptly at the FPM thresholds. All factors aecting employment,
wages and total earnings should be continuous at the cutos (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008; Lee
and Lemieux, 2010, 2014). This RD assumption is similar to the "exclusion restriction" in
an IV setting requiring that the `instrument' (law-implied FPM transfers around the cutos

actual FPM and law-implied FPM transfers across each of the seven cutos. There is a strong link across
cutos (Appendix Table 6) and geographic regions (Appendix Table 24).
26 We also examined how these estimates vary across each of the seven cutos separately (Appendix Tables
7 and 8): the discontinuities in the the FPM allocation mechanism aect transfers, revenues and expenditure
across each cuto. In Appendix Table 24, we show that the link between FPM/transfers and spending do not
dier across broad geographic regions. In Appendix Table 9, we split total municipal spending into current
wage, current non-wage, and capital expenditure. All types of expenditure jump when municipalities cross
to higher FPM population intervals. In Appendix Table 10, we report estimates distinguishing between the
main expenditure categories. All types of expenditure increase/fall, as cities cross FPM cutos.
16

(a) Municipal Revenues

in our application) should aect the outcomes only via determining the endogenous variable
(actual FPM transfers and associated municipal spending). While this assumption cannot
be directly tested, there are many pieces of supportive evidence.
First, since our identication strategy explores within-municipality variation in transfers and labor market outcomes, concerns related to selection or that cities may dier systematically across geographic, institutional or other features (which apply to cross-sectional
27

approaches) are not particularly severe.

Furthermore, Gadenne (2017) shows that munici-

palities moving to an adjacent FPM population bracket are similar to those that do not cross
the cutos across many political economy features, such as the political alignment of the
mayor and councillors to the federal government, political competition, and mayoral terms.
Second, to the best of our knowledge there is no other federal or state grant scheme
that follows a similar to FPM discontinuous allocation mechanism.

28

One may worry that

municipal governments gaining extra FPM funds may decide not to spend them. Likewise,
municipalities that receive less FPM funds may obtain additional funding from the state or
other federal transfer programs. These issues are, however, unlikely in our setting: municipalities run balanced budgets and their expenditure tightly adjusts to their revenues. In Table

5

we test whether FPM transfers correlate with state transfers, non-FPM federal transfers

27 Brollo,

Nannicini, Tabellini and Perotti (2013) provide cross-sectional evidence that municipalities just
above and just below FPM thresholds do not dier on many time-invariant characteristics.
28 After 2004 local councillors pay increases abruptly (by 50%) for municipalities with more than 10, 000
inhabitants, a value close to the rst threshold of 10, 188. Ferraz and Finan (2011) show that the characteristics of councillors dier at this cuto. We have thus veried that our ndings are not sensitive to excluding
observations centered on the initial cuto. See Appendix Table 14.

Starting with the evolution

the local regression estimates are small and

statistically indistinguishable from zero. These patterns, which apply with OLS in levels and
log-levels and LAD, show that state transfers do not vary systematically at the population

The local regression estimates are small, change sign, and are all sta-

tistically indistinguishable from zero. Figures 6a-6c provide visualization of these patterns.
There is no abrupt change at the FPM discontinuities.

3.2.4 Precise Systematic Manipulation
RD design strategies rely on the assumption that if individuals (municipalities) have imprecise
control over the running variable (population), this implies that variation in treatment status
(i.e., be above or below the FPM cutos) will be randomized in a neighborhood of the
threshold (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). If there is precise manipulation of population estimates

and this correlates with the labor market outcome, then the estimates will not identify the
causal eect of regional transfers. Although it is impossible to directly test such assumption,
we comment here for brevity and report in the appendix three sets of exercises.
First, we examine whether the density of population and population changes are con-

29 Local

tax rates are not used as a stabilisation tool. Increasing local tax rates is politically costly for
mayors and local legislatures (Oliveira-Junior, 2014). A federal law has been proposed recently to establish
rules forcing municipalities to increase periodically their tax rates so to protect local mayors from public
pressure to keep taxes low (Projeto de Lei do Senado (PLS) 46/2016). Smaller municipalities lack technical
capacity to eciently enforce such taxation. A national eort led by the Brazilian Development Bank has
been introduced to help small municipalities modernize their tax system management (Gadenne, 2017).

18

tinuous at the cutos. While the Mc Grary density plots uncover some manipulation, it is
restricted only to years when population censuses were conducted.

So we re-run all spec-

ications excluding census years and nd almost identical results.

Moreover, we estimate

fuzzy-RD specications focusing solely on municipality-years with either no movement across
FPM intervals or falling into lower population intervals. Again the results are similar. We also
estimate restrictive specications that, on top of municipality xed-eects, add municipalityterm-specic mayoral constants so to account even more for unobservables. The results are
again similar.

Second, we perform a falsication test to check whether lagged `treatment'

variables (actual FPM, revenues and expenditure) vary abruptly at FPM cutos. We nd
that they do not, implying that municipalities narrowly above the FPM thresholds are not
more likely to have been above or below the threshold in the previous year. Third, we conduct a placebo test in which all cutos are moved by

750

inhabitants, and examine whether

the `treatment' variables jump at the `fake' discontinuities.

In line with our identication

strategy, there are no swings at the `fake' cutos.

4 Employment and Wages in the Public Sector
We start our analysis by examining the responses of employment and wages in the municipal public sector to locally exogenous (at the FPM cutos) swings in regional transfers.
This serves three purposes. First, it provides evidence on the composition of the municipal
government expenditure on public sector wages and employment. Second, linking swings of
federal transfers to municipalities with their spending patterns is interesting from a political
economy standpoint. Third, it provides a benchmark against which, in the next section, we
will evaluate the eects of regional transfers on private sector outcomes.

4.1 Baseline Eects
In Table

6,

we report RD specications that associate total municipal earnings, employment

and wages to law-implied transfers. Since the `rst-stage' link between actual and law-implied
FPM transfers is strong, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from one, we simply
report OLS estimates in logs.

IV (`fuzzy' RD) estimates are similar and thus we do not

report them for brevity. Columns (2)-(4) record local linear regression coecients that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the seven discontinuities using progressively smaller

19

Figure 7: Total Earnings of Public Sector Employees around the cutos

bandwidths (4%,

3%

and

2%).

Columns (5)-(7) display otherwise identical specications

including linear polynomials on population distance from the discontinuity, allowing for different slopes above and below cutos and cuto-specic constants (rectangular kernel). For
comparability, in column (1) we report full sample estimates (i.e. both close and far from the
discontinuities).
Let us start with the specications for total earnings of municipal public sector employees
in row (1).

The coecient implies that a one-percentage-point increase in FPM transfers

generate an extra

0.21%âˆ’0.26% increase in the total earnings of all municipal employees.

elasticity is stable across the various specications.

30

The

Figure 7 gives a graphical illustration

of the jump (fall) in the earnings of municipal (public-sector) employees when municipalities
move to a higher (lower) FPM cuto.

31

We decompose total municipal earnings into employment and average wage per worker
to examine whether local authorities recruit more people or whether they raise wages for
existing municipal employees in response to changes in federal transfers. Rows (2)-(3) report
the estimates.

Swings in regional transfers close to the FPM discontinuities aect both

municipal employment and the wage rate.

30 These

estimates are close to the ones in row (2) of Appendix Table 9, which reports the coecient of
law-implied FPM transfers on the total municipal wage bill. This is a non-trivial test as total earnings of
municipal employees and the total wage bill of municipalities come from completely dierent datasets (RAIS
- Ministry of Labor administrative dataset and FINBRA - Public Finance of Municipalities, respectively).
31 The pattern is similar, though attenuated, using a model in rst-dierences (see Appendix Table 11).

Figure 8: Public Sector Employment and Wage Rate (New vs Old Hires)

4.2 New-hires vs Old-hires
We further explore the relationship between regional transfers and municipal sector employment and wages, distinguishing between `new-hires' and `old-hires' recruited in current or
previous years. Panel

B

A

of Table

7

reports estimates focusing on `old-hires' whereas Panel

refers to `new-hires'. The elasticity of FPM transfers to total earnings is signicantly pos-

itive for both groups of municipal employees. The increase in total earnings of pre-existing
municipal employees, when cities jump to a higher FPM bracket, comes from higher average
wages.

The jump in total earnings of the newly-hired is reected on higher employment.

Local governments, on average, hire more people (at the same wage rate they hired workers
in the previous years) and increase the wage of pre-existing employees when faced with an
increase in federal transfers. Figures 8a-8d illustrate these patterns.

32 Similar

32

results are obtained using an empirical model in rst-dierences (see Appendix Table 12).

21

5 Employment and Wages in the Private Sector
We rst present the baseline fuzzy-RD estimates of the eects of regional transfers on the
private sector.

Second, we calculate the cost of a new private sector job.

Third, using a

simple accounting method we map the employment estimates into a local income multiplier.
Fourth, we examine how the multiplier estimates change if local spending was self-nanced
(e.g. by local tax revenues) using a currency union model.

5.1 Baseline Eects
In Table

8

- Panel

A

we report `reduced-form' estimates (equation (3)) linking total labor

earnings, employment and average wage per employee with law-implied FPM transfers. Panel

B

records the corresponding fuzzy-RD estimates, which combine the reduced-form with the

corresponding rst-stage estimates associating actual with law-implied FPM transfers (Table

3-Panel B ,

row (2)).

The elasticity between law-implied transfers and total private sector earnings is around

0.15

across the various specications. Since the rst-stage t is strong and the elasticity of

actual and law-implied FPM transfers is close to unity, the fuzzy-RD estimates are similar,
ranging from

0.1 âˆ’ 0.19.

Conditional on unobserved time-invariant municipal factors, Brazil-

wide and state-specic trends as well as cuto-specic time trends, a twenty percent increase
in federal transfers (roughly the step in the FPM allocation function, equation (1)) is associated with a

3% âˆ’ 4%

boost in private-sector labor income. This corresponds to roughly the

mean of earnings growth. Figure 9 gives a graphical illustration of this core result. There is
an evident jump (fall) in total labor earnings of private sector employees when municipalities
move to a higher (lower) FPM population interval.
We then examine whether the impact of regional transfers on the local economy stems from
increased private sector hiring (employment) or via higher wages. The estimates in rows (2)
and (3) reveal that regional transfers aect mostly employment. The coecients of log lawimplied FPM on log private employment are always signicant at standard condence levels.
The FPM private employment elasticity ranges between

0.10 âˆ’ 0.21.

Figure 10a illustrates

the higher level of private employment on the right side of the pooled FPM discontinuities.
In contrast, Figure 10b shows no evident change in average wages at the pooled FPM cutos.
In line with this illustration, the transfers-wages elasticities in row (3) are small (0.02 âˆ’ 0.06)

are calculated using the elasticity formula and are based on the IV fuzzy-RD estimates.
23

An additional

BRL 30, 000

of municipal government spending is associated with around one

extra public-sector job and three extra private-sector jobs. Given that the elasticities of regional transfers with respect to public and private sector employment are around

0.15,

this

dierence reects the fact that - in terms of number of employees - the size of the private
sector is roughly three times the size of the public sector (see Table

2).

Alternatively, our results can be framed in terms of the average cost of an extra job
per year.

The third row of Table

9

shows that for the local economy to increase by an

additional headcount, FPM transfers need to raise on average by an amount between
and

8, 700 BRL

at constant

1998

prices (or by about 8,000

U SD

at constant

2016

6, 100
price).

The average cost per job implied by our RD estimates across a sample of relatively small
Brazilian municipalities is roughly one fourth of the corresponding calculation of about USD

30, 000

that Serrato and Wingender (2016) report across US counties (which are comparable
34

in size to Brazilian municipalities).

This is consistent with the real wage and productivity

gaps between Brazil and the U.S. that can be found in national statistics (as for instance
reported by the World Bank Indicators database).

5.3 Local Income Multiplier
Several recent works on the local eects of scal policy present their results in terms of local
multipliers (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014; Acconcia

et al., 2014; Serrato and Wingender,

2016 and Shoag, 2013). Chodorow-Reich (2017) summarizes this body of research and proposes a simple and intuitive way to convert local employment multipliers to income/output
multipliers. Assuming a neoclassical production function linking output (Yt ) to employment
(Et ), hours worked (Ht ) and productivity (A), without capital adjustment in the short-run
[Yt

= A(Ht Et )1âˆ’Î¾ ],

output and employment multipliers are linked by the following simple

expression:

Y
ÂµY = (1 âˆ’ Î¾)(1 + Ï‡) ÂµE .

where ÂµY denotes the output/income multiplier and ÂµE is the employment multiplier, namely

aimed to mitigate the economy from the collapse of economic activity, Chodorow-Reich et al (2012) estimate
a cost per job in the range of 16, 000 âˆ’ 50, 000 USD, while Dube et al. (2012) estimate is close to 25, 000
USD and Feyrer and Sacerdote (2012) estimate is closer to 50, 000 (though with a wide range). Adelino et al.
(2012) estimate a cost per job of around 21, 000 USD and Shoag (2013) estimates a cost per job of around
35, 000 USD. USD. See Chodorow-Reich (2017) for an overview of these works.

5.4 Insights from a Currency Union Model
We now examine how our empirical ndings compare with the predictions of a macroeconomic
model of government spending nanced by regional transfers in a currency union. We also
assess the extent to which the size of the estimated eects depend on the way expenses are
paid for, whether via transfers from the central government or via local tax revenues. This
is important because as Ramey (2016) notes the constants and time xed-eects "dierence
out the eects of the nancing" as the FPM program is funded by taxes at the federal level.
To this end, we employ the theoretical setup of Farhi and Werning (2016), which provides
closed-form solutions to local multipliers under alternative nancing rules. This theoretical
model, which builds on Gali and Monacelli (2008), Corsetti, Kuester and Muller (2013) and
Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), nests neoclassical and Keynesian eects of scal policy in a
currency union under complete and incomplete markets.

35 We

35

are grateful to Emmanuel Farhi and Ivan Werning for kindly sharing the codes for their model.

5.4.1 Model and Parameterization
In a nutshell, households with constant-elasticity-of-substitution (love for variety) preferences
over dierentiated goods derive utility from private consumption, government expenditure,
and leisure. Firms compete monopolistically and face a xed probability of resetting prices in
each quarter. Agents can only trade a risk-free bond and their consumption is tilted toward
locally produced goods.

The local government engages in public spending, which can be

nanced via taxes either at the local or at the currency union level. The nominal interest
rate is xed, consistent with our empirical specications where the time-eects absorb, among
other things, variation in monetary policy.

36

In an eort to limit our degrees of freedom, we borrow most parameter values from Farhi
and Werning (2016).

37

For steady state values, we set the real interest rate to

local government spending-output ratio in Brazil to

10%,

0.25,

these parameters and because Brazilian municipalities are likely to dier along many hard-toobserved dimensions, in our quantitative analysis we vary the values of each of the following
parameters (keeping all other coecients xed at their baseline values): (i) the fraction of
the consumption basket that is not locally produced ranges between

5.4.2 Results
In Figure 11, we report the one-year cumulated response of local output to a government
spending shock as large as

1%

of steady state output. The top, middle and bottom panels

36 For

brevity we do not sketch fully their model. Details can be found in Farhi and Werning (2016), Gali
and Monacelli (2008), Corsetti, Kuester and Muller (2013), Nakamura and Steinsson (2014).
37 In particular, the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution is set to 1, the elasticity of labor supply to 3,
the elasticity between local and foreign goods to 1, and the elasticity of varieties to 6. These values are also
in line with earlier works (e.g. Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014).

26

Figure 11: Externally-Financed vs Locally-Financed Multipliers

display the magnitude of the local multipliers as we alter respectively the parameter capturing
home bias in consumption, the share of hand-to-mouth consumers and the share of price
resetting rms. Each panel presents two lines: the blue-circled lines summarize the eects on
local output of municipal government spending nanced by regional transfers from currency
union-wide tax revenues (as in our estimates); the red lines plot the local output eects of
municipal spending if this was nanced instead by raising local taxes.

38

Hence, the dierence

between blue and red lines can be interpreted as the contribution of the source of public
nance to the impact of scal policy on the local economy.
Several interesting results emerge from Figure 11. First, the eect of government spending on local economic activity varies with key model parameters reecting features of the
Brazilian economy that are hard-to-observe at the municipal level.

The impact of public

expenditure is stronger for relatively closed economies (top panel), when more agents face
liquidity constraints (middle panel) and when prices are less exible. Second, the externallynanced multiplier ranges between

1.2

and

2.8.

Under the baseline parameterization (i.e.,

when the shares of liquidity-constrained consumers and price resetting rms are around
and municipalities' openness around

0.4),

the local multiplier is close to

predictions confront well with the fuzzy-RD estimates in Table

9,

2:

39

municipal government spending.

Third, if local public expenditure was nanced instead

by local tax revenues, then the multiplier would have been signicantly lower, in the range

[0.8, 1.4].40
and

50%

The model simulations reveal that locally-nanced multipliers are between

20%

smaller than externally-nanced multipliers. The gap is smaller for municipalities

more open to trade and less constrained in their access to nancial markets.

38 The

red line may also be interpreted as the locus of national scal multipliers for a small open economy
operating in a liquidity trap (i.e., with a xed nominal interest rate) and under a xed exchange rate regime.
As emphasized by Farhi and Werning (2016), the national multiplier in a liquidity trap is likely to be larger
under a exible exchange rate regime as the initial devaluation associated with the scal expansion triggers
also an expenditure-switching eect.
39 The intuition behind these large eects on local output come from the fact that government spending
is nanced externally and therefore Ricardian eects are modest. Furthermore, home-bias in consumption
implies that federal transfers yield Keynesian demand eects that are suciently large to dominate the
(negative) neoclassical wealth eect. Farhi and Werning (2016) show that the neoclassical channel becomes
relevant only when the terms-of-trade appreciate considerably.
40 Interestingly, this range of values is consistent with the estimates of the national (and therefore internallynanced) multiplier surveyed by Ramey (2011a) and reported by Ramey and Zubairy (2017).

6 Sector Analysis
We now investigate the impact of regional transfers on private sector labor market outcomes
across dierent sectors of the Brazilian economy. Table

10

reports local RD estimates that

associate law-implied FPM transfers with total earnings, employment, and average wage per
employee in Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services (see Table
The focus of Panel

A is on agriculture.

2).

The coecients of log transfers on log total earnings

in row (1) are unstable, small, and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Similarly, there
is no association between regional transfers and employment or average wages in agriculture
(rows (2) and (3)).
In Panel

B

we report estimates for manufacturing. The elasticities of total earnings in

manufacturing with law-implied FPM transfers in row (1) are all positive but statistically
insignicant. When we decompose manufacturing earnings to employment and average wages,
there is some evidence of a positive eect of transfers on manufacturing employment. The
estimates in row (2) are positive, implying potentially sizeable eects (elasticity range

0.09 âˆ’

0.27).

However, the estimates are rather inaccurate and statistically indistinguishable from

zero.

The elasticity of mean manufacturing wages to FPM transfers in row (3) is close to

zero, changes sign and never passes standard signicance levels. Overall, there seems to be
a weak positive link between regional transfers and employment in the manufacturing sector
while we detect virtually no eect on wages.
In Panel

C

we present results for services. There appears to be a strong association be-

tween total earnings in services and federal transfers (row (1)).

The coecient is positive

and highly signicant across all bandwidths, both in the simple local regressions reported in
columns (2)-(4) and in the specications with linear polynomials in columns (5)-(7).
elasticity is tightly estimated, ranging from

0.15 âˆ’ 0.20.

The

A twenty percent increase in FPM

transfers roughly the average jump when a municipality moves across FPM cutos is associated with a

3% âˆ’ 4%

increase in total earnings for the service sector. This is to be compared

with an average/median growth in earnings of around

10%.

As the specications in rows

(2)-(3) show, this eect is driven by employment. As municipalities move to a higher FPM
population interval (and therefore local revenues and municipal spending rise accordingly)
private sector employment in services increases considerably. There is a local multiplier effect as an increase (decrease) in local public spending is strongly associated to a hike (fall)
in employment. In contrast, the impact of regional transfers on average wages in services is

29

(a) Agriculture

(b) Manufacturing

(c) Services

Figure 12: Employment in Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services

small and statistically insignicant.
Figures 12 provide visual evidence of the sector-specic patterns in private employment.

41

Figure 12a shows that employment in agriculture does not change abruptly at the FPM cutos. Figure 12b shows some evidence of a jump in manufacturing employment for municipalities moving to a higher FPM population interval. In line with the noisy estimates in Table

10-Panel B ,

the jump is visible but not sharp. Figure 12c exhibits a clear jump in municipal

employment for services.
Overall, the results point out that the eect of FPM transfers on local private sector earnings and employment (Table

9)

is driven mostly by services, a result in line with

New-Keynesian models that predict strong demand-driven eects of scal transfers on nontradables (Farhi and Werning, 2016, 2017). There is little evidence of an impact on wages
and employment in agriculture and there is only a weak eect on manufacturing employment.

7 Further Evidence and Sensitivity Analysis
In this section, we explore some potentially interesting dimensions of heterogeneity and discuss some necessary robustness checks that corroborates the inference from our analysis.

7.1 Heterogeneity
There are considerable dierences on economic, institutional and nancial development between the South and the North of Brazil. Perhaps due to geographic dierences, isolation and
dierent colonial history, the southern states are more developed than northern states. We

41 We

thus examine the link between local labor market outcomes and regional transfers separately
for municipalities in the southern and the northern states.

The elasticity of law-implied FPM transfers and total earnings in the private sector (Panel

that in southern cities a

in-

crease in private employment. The elasticities of northern municipalities, however, are lower
and less signicant. This pattern is consistent with the evidence in Becker, Egger and von
Ehrlich. (2013), who show that the eects of regional transfers are larger in European regions
with above-average levels of human capital endowment and quality of government. Finally,
in Panel C, we show that there is virtually no link between regional transfers and the wage
rate in both samples. For a RD-graph visualization of these patterns see Appendix Figure
A.14a-A.14b.
Our sample includes smaller and larger municipalities, with non-negligible dierences in
income per capita (Table

1).

We re-estimate the reduced-form specications allowing the

impact of federal transfers to dier for smaller and larger municipalities.

42

Nannicini, Tabellini and Perotti (2013), we pool all municipalities around cutos

reports the results. The estimates on total private sector earnings is signicantly higher

in smaller municipalities (Panel

A).

The employment specications (Panel

B ) yield a clearer

pattern: economically sizeable eect of transfers on private employment in smaller municipalities and substantially weaker (and in most specications statistically indistinguishable from
zero) in larger ones. There is some weak evidence of a positive association between transfers
and average wage per employee in larger cities (Panel

42 The

C ).

rst-stage link between law-implied and actual FPM transfers (and municipal spending) is homogeneous across city size (Appendix Table 24 - Panel B ).

31

7.2 Robustness Checks
We perturbe the baseline empirical model across various dimensions to examine the robustness
of the estimates.

For brevity, we discuss and report these results in the Supplementary

Appendix and just summarize them below.
First, we estimate rst-dierences specications. Changes in law-implied FPM transfers
are signicantly correlated with increases in municipal employment new-hires and average
wages of old-hires.

Changes in regional transfers close to the FPM cutos boost private

employment, especially in services.
Second, we drop observations around the rst cuto (10, 188) as it is close to the discontinuity in the pay of local politicians (10, 000) after
not aect any of our results (Appendix Table
Third, we drop census years (2001,

2008

2004

(Ferraz and Finan, 2011). This does

and

of population in those years. Even though manipulation does not invalidate the RDD
estimates are similar to the baseline results, though a bit noisier (Appendix Table

43

15)

, the

.

Fourth, we drop observations of municipalities `moving up' to a higher FPM population
bracket and explored the link between transfers and earnings/employment in municipalities
that either stay in the same bracket or `move down'.

By doing so, we minimize concerns

that manipulation (to get transfers) is related to the outcomes.

Both public and private

sector employment respond to the fall in regional transfers (Appendix Table
employment eect comes mainly from the service sector (Appendix Table

16).

The private

21).

Fifth, to control for mayor's ability, we replaced municipal with mayor-specic xedeects.

44

Although the estimates are less accurate, the coecients are quite similar, revealing

a boost of private employment in response to increased FPM transfers (Appendix Table
mostly driven by services (Appendix Table

17),

22).

Sixth, we estimate RD specications with higher-order polynomials in population. The
reduced-form and IV elasticity between total earnings in the private sector (and especially
private employment) and FPM transfers are highly signicant and, if anything, are larger
than the local regression estimates (Appendix Table

18).

and Lemieux (2014) write: "If individuals - even while having some inuence - are unable to precisely
manipulate the assignment variable, a consequence of this is that the variation in treatment near the threshold
is randomized as though from a randomized experiment."
44 Gadenne (2017) shows that mayor's characteristics, political orientation and connectedness to the federal
government are similar at the two sides of the FPM cutos. So in practice this is not a major concern.
43 Lee

32

Seventh, we examine whether there are regional spillovers, augmenting the baseline specication with outcome aggregated at the regional (meso-region) level. There is little evidence
of spillover eects (Appendix Table

19).45

Eighth, we investigate whether the increase in federal transfers has delayed eects. While
there is some inertia, the bulk of transfers' impact on public and private sector employment
occurs within the year (Appendix Table

20).

8 Conclusions
We study the labor market eects of regional transfers in a large currency union, Brazil,
applying a `fuzzy-RD' design that exploits for identication the highly non-linear allocation mechanism of funds from the federal government to municipalities.

Federal transfers,

municipal public revenues and spending change abruptly at various pre-determined population cutos, according to yearly population estimates provided by the independent federal
statistical agency and court of auditors.
The fuzzy-RD estimates appear clear-cut. As municipalities cross the pre-assigned population cutos shaping federal transfers, there is a signicant boost in private sector income
and employment. For every

30, 000

USD increase in municipal government receipts from the

federal government, the local economy witnesses an extra job in the public sector and three
extra jobs in the private sector. Existing workers in the public sector also experience a pay
rise.

As for the private sector, the eect on wages is mild and insignicant.

The sizeable

impact of federal transfers on private employment stems from the service sector and, to a
lesser extent, in manufacturing. We also nd that the stimulative eects of local government
spending funded by regional transfers from the federal government are somewhat stronger in
the southern states and in relatively smaller municipalities.
To oer insights on the transmission of scal policy and the role of regional transfers in a
currency-union, we employ a New-Keynesian open-economy model with incomplete markets,
nancial frictions and nominal rigidities. We show that the model can replicate our estimates
of the local eects of scal policy on economic activity. We also use the model to predict
the impact of municipal spending if this was nanced by local taxes rather than external

In this case, local multipliers are considerably smaller, suggesting that regional

transfers could be a useful stabilization tool in a currency union.

No discernible pattern emerges relative to the descriptive

statistics in the full sample (both close and far from the FPM population cutos) in Table

2.

A.2 Examples of the FPM Allocation Mechanism
To illustrate the discontinuous nature of the FPM allocation mechanism, we discuss two sets
of examples where FPM transfers change from one year to the next, as municipalities cross
the pre-determined population cutos depicted in Figure

1.

Dierences in FPM transfers

for a given municipality over two consecutive years are driven by two (possibly opposing)
forces: (i) the move, if any, to a higher or lower population FPM interval, (ii) the growth of
the national economy which, when positive (as in the case of Brazil over our sample period),
translates into higher scal revenues at the federal level and thus a larger total pot of money
available for the FPM program (which is independent of municipal population estimates).
Consider two pairs of municipalities in the state of
and

2011

displayed in Figure A.1.

Minas Gerais 46 over the years

The rst pair consists of Bela Vista and Centralina.

These municipalities experienced a slight drop in population over that period. On the one
hand, Bela Vista population went from

to

inhabitants. The small decline was

The drop was smaller than 20% (which is the drop in the

FPM coecient) because during 2010-2011 the total FPM pot of funds increased considerably
as Brazil growth was close to

10, 557

to

10, 266

4%.

On the other hand, the population of Centralina fell from

inhabitants, but the municipality remained in the same population bracket

over the same period.

simply reecting the overall raise in the total pot of

funds at the national level. On the other hand, Caetanopolis population increased only by

178

inhabitants from

to

10, 218,

which was enough to move Caetonopolis to a higher

FPM population bracket (Î» increased from

R$2, 686, 415,

Accordingly, FPM transfers increased

reecting both the higher FPM coecient

and the increase in the total proceeds of the FPM program at the federal level.
As discussed in Section

3,

a necessary condition for identication is that not only federal

transfers but also municipal expenditure change abruptly at the FPM cutos.

Figure A.2

mirrors Figure A.1 but with expenditure instead of transfers. On the one hand, municipal
spending from

2010

to

2011

increases in both Bela Vista and Centralina as the Brazilian

economy was growing and the FPM program expanded. Centralina increased spending relatively less than Bela Vista, as it received less from the FPM program. Similarly, municipal
spending raised in both Caetanopolis and Pedralva over that period. But the public spending hike in Caetanopolis was sharper as this municipality beneted also from an increase in
federal transfers.

43

Figure A.2: Expenditure and FPM allocation mechanism

A.3 Identifying Assumptions
In this section we provide further evidence on the validity of the identifying assumptions
behind the fuzzy-RD empirical design.

A.3.1 Federal Transfers
In Appendix Table

5, we report estimates associating actual and law-implied FPM transfers in

log-dierences (columns (1)-(3)), OLS-dierences (columns (4)-(6)) and least-absolute deviation (LAD)-dierences (columns (7)-(9)). While taking rst-dierences comes at an eciency
loss, these models further account for outliers and unobserved characteristics.

Changes in

actual transfers closely match changes in law-implied transfers. OLS and LAD estimates are
very close to unity; and log-dierences are only slightly attenuated (0.94). In these specications, we do not include any RD polynomial and we just progressively narrow the bandwidth.
The results are similar if we add RD polynomials in both years or simply control for changes
in population.
In Appendix Table

6,

we examine the relationship between actual and law-implied trans-

fers by cuto. The rst two rows report coecients pooling thresholds 1-3 and 4-7 (as Brollo,
Nannicini, Perotti, and Tabellini, 2013). The following seven rows reports estimates for each
cuto separately. All estimates are close to unity, suggesting that the FPM allocation mech-

anism is on average enforced. Appendix Figure A.3 provides visual evidence of the jumps of
federal transfers at FPM cutos.

4 âˆ’ 7.

Appendix Figure A.4 provides visual illustrations of these

patterns. Rows (3)-(9) give cuto-specic estimates. For brevity, we just report logarithmic
specications. All variables are in logs, so the coecients should be close to the share of FPM
transfers over revenues and expenditure for the relevant sample (reported on the right in each
table). The estimates on law-implied FPM transfers are positive and highly signicant. The
estimates are close to the corresponding shares across all cutos, though the estimates for
cutos

6

and

7

are somewhat noisy, as the number of observations around these thresholds

is small (see Appendix Table

2).

45

(a) Threshold 1-3

(b) Threshold 4-7

Figure A.4: Municipal Expenditure around thresholds 1-3 and 4-7

A.3.3 Municipal Expenditure
In Appendix Table

8, log municipal spending is associated with log law-implied FPM transfers

by cuto. In the rst two rows, we pool thresholds

1âˆ’3 and 4âˆ’7, while the other rows report

cuto-specic estimates. The elasticities are positive and highly signicant. The estimates
loose signicance only in the narrow bandwidth (2%) of large cities (cutos 6-7), which are
only a few in our sample. Overall the cuto-specic estimates show that as municipalities
move to higher (lower) population FPM intervals, local government expenditure increases
considerably across both small and large cities.
In Appendix Table

9,

we examine the pervasiveness of municipal spending, as munici-

palities move across FPM cutos.

The table reports estimates of how law-implied transfers

aect current expenditure (net of wages), wage bill, and capital expenditure. All main types
of municipal expenditure move as cities cross the FPM population cutos shaping regional
transfers from the federal government. Figure A.5 provides visual illustrations of this pattern.
Similarly, the focus of Appendix Table

10

is on the main categories of municipal spend-

ing, namely public administration, education, health, housing & urbanism, and others. All
coecients are positive and highly signicant, suggesting that the increase in municipal expenditure triggered by a "locally" (close to the FPM cutos) exogenous increase in transfers
is spread across all budget categories

A.4 Mis-assignment and Law-Implied FPM Transfers
Actual FPM Transfers do not always exactly correspond to what they should be based of
the FPM allocation rule. This explains why the association between actual and law-implied
FPM transfers simply based on the allocation formula does not yield a perfect in-sample t
(Table

3).

Yet, mis-assignment is not systematic as the estimated coecients linking actual

and law-implied FPM transfers is one and tightly estimated (Tables

3âˆ’4, Appendix Table 6).

There are many reasons behind the imperfect enforcement of the FPM allocation mechanism.
In the 1990s some municipalities split into two, but temporarily managed to keep their
former FPM coecient through court disputes. In an eort to correct for such distortions,
the federal government (through a Complementary Law LC 91/97) mandated that all municipalities should be framed in the correct population brackets with their relevant coecients
by

2008.

To prevent immediate disruption to the public nances of the municipalities in-

volved, the law established a transition period to the new regime, so that in the period

1999 âˆ’ 2007

some municipalities still received FPM transfers which were not consistent with

their population estimate.
Law LC 91/97 determined that FPM transfers for these municipalities should be calculated using a modied FPM coecient (Î»Ìƒt ), which equals a weighted average of their
coecient in

1997 (Î»97 )

and their "correct" coecient in year

A.5 Systematic Manipulation
We provide here three set of results to support the identication assumption, which require
that the local variation in the assignment to treatment is as-good-as random in the neighborhood of the cutos (Lee and Lemieux, 2010).

A.5.1 Population Density Test
We begin by testing whether the density of population estimates is continuous at the cutos.
Figure A.6a presents the McCrary (2008) density test for all years in our sample (1999

2014).

Figures A.6b and A.6c split the sample into (a) census years (2001,

2008, 2011)

and (b) non-census years while Figure A.7 reports visualizations for each year.
pattern emerges:

âˆ’

A clear

manipulative sorting behavior seems to be present in census years but

there is no such evidence in non-Census years.

It would seem that municipal authorities

seek to attract new residents (or simply changing the numbers) just in time for the ocial
counting (Monasterio, 2013). In contrast, little manipulation seems to happen during noncensus years. This is consistent with the fact that population estimates in these years are
calculated by IBGE (an independent federal institute) using a publicly known methodology
that incorporates data from past censuses, administrative records from migration, births and
deaths. [Below we show that the results are unaected by using data only from non-census
years].
Motivated by the use of within-municipality variation for identication (see Gadenne,
2017), we consider whether the probability of crossing a FPM cuto is dierent from the
probability of crossing any other population cuto by plotting changes in population between
years

t

and

tâˆ’1

as a function of distance to the cuto at time

t âˆ’ 1.

This is akin to a

manipulation test on population changes instead of levels. Figure A.8 provides supporting

FPM cutos.

Changes in population are quite similar at the two sides of the pooled

Municipalities that eventually cross FPM cutos and receive a higher FPM

coecient do not experience on average higher population growth than municipalities that
do not cross the population cutos. This test further supports our identication design that
exploits within-municipality variation on FPM, expenditure, and local economy outcomes.

A.5.2 Falsication Tests
To further evaluate the validity of our analysis, we performed complementary tests following
the suggestions in Eggers, Freier, Grembi and Nannicini (2016). First, we undertake a falsication test in which lagged `treatment' variables are viewed as outcomes in an RDD analysis.
Figure A.9a replicates our identication hypothesis, namely that current FPM transfers respond strongly to the allocation mechanism discontinuity as dened by FPM law.

Figure

A.9b mirrors that but with lagged FPM. Consistent with the view that that municipalities
narrowly above the threshold are not more likely to have been above the threshold in the
previous year, lagged FPM does not vary abruptly at the cuto. Figure A.10 and A.11 repeat
the exercise for lagged municipal revenues and expenditure. The patterns are similar: there
is no jump of revenues and expenditure at the FPM thresholds when one uses lagged values.

A.5.3 Placebo Tests
We also conducted placebo tests in which all cutos are articially and counterfactually
moved to the right (and left) of the population distribution by

This is shown in Figure A.12 where we articially move the FPM cutos to the

A.6 Sensitivity Analysis
In this section we report results and discuss various perturbations and checks that assess the
robustness of our estimates.

Public Sector Labor Market.

First, we estimate rst-dierence specications to fur-

ther account for unobserved characteristics. In Appendix Table

11,

we report estimates that

link local public sector labor market outcomes with law-implied FPM transfers. Columns (1)(3) report log-dierence specications; columns (4)-(6) refer to OLS dierence specications,
while columns (7)-(9) report LAD-dierences models.
specications are around

0.1

and

0.07

Point estimates from log-dierences

for earnings and employment, respectively. These are

somewhat smaller than the baseline specication estimates (in log levels reported in Table

6).

OLS dierence specications yield positive but imprecise estimates. Yet, when we run

"median" regressions to account for extreme values the estimates become signicant.
In Appendix Table

12,

we report similar estimates separating the eect for `old-hires',

i.e. those who have been hired over one year earlier, and `new-hires'. A similar pattern to
Table

7

albeit more noisy emerges. Estimates from log-dierences specication corroborate

the view that earnings for both old and new-hires are positively aected by transfers. Most
of the aggregate eect seems to come from an increase in average wage of the old-hires and

52

an increase in the number of new-hires.

Private Sector Labor Market.

In Appendix Table

13,

we record rst-dierences

specications for private sector earnings, employment, and average wages. The results are
clear-cut and much in line with the baseline estimates (Table

8).

Locally exogenous changes

in federal transfers signicantly aect local private sector earnings and employment. Point
estimates from log-dierences specications are around

0.10-0.15,

slightly smaller than the

ones from our baseline specication (in log levels). OLS and LAD rst-dierence specications
yield a similar pattern. Increases in regional transfers close to the FPM discontinuities are
associated with increases in total private labor income, stemming almost exclusively from
a boost in private employment.

A benet of these (non-log) rst-dierences specications

is that they are easily interpretable. For instance, the OLS estimates imply
private sector jobs for a

2.5 âˆ’ 3

of

in Table

9.

2.1 âˆ’ 2.7

extra

U S$30, 000 increase in spending, comparable to our baseline estimate

LAD estimates imply somewhat smaller eects.

Excluding Observations around the rst threshold.

Our empirical strategy as-

sumes that no feature other than federal transfers change abruptly at the FPM discontinuities.

As detailed in Section

2,

this is the case in our sample of relatively small Brazilian

municipalities, with one exception: a
in

2005

2000

Constitutional amendment which was enforced

placed caps on the salaries of local council members and made these caps change

discontinuously at some population cutos. While most of these population cutos for salary
cups are only relevant for large cities (not included in our sample), the rst cuto of the FPM
transfer allocation mechanism (10, 188) is close to the rst discontinuity on the salary cap
(10, 000). Hence we re-estimate our main specications excluding observations of municipalities around the rst cuto.

48

The results are reported in Appendix Table

14.

Although there

is strong link between federal transfers and private sector employment in small cities centered
around cuto

1,

the coecients on law-implied transfers resemble closely our rst-stage and

reduced-form estimates.

Excluding Observations from Census Years.

A key identifying assumption is that

local authorities should not be in a position to precisely manipulate population estimates so as

48 Ferraz

and Finan (2011) show that higher wages of local politicians triggered by the 2005 change are
associated with increased political competition, legislative productivity and public goods provision.
53

to receive more FPM transfers. Since there is some cross-sectional evidence of manipulation
in Census years, we repeated estimation excluding census years (2001,
Appendix Table

15,

2008

and

2011).

In

we report the RD estimates excluding Census years, which comes at

a non-negligible eciency loss as the total number of observations in the sample drops by
some

25%.

The elasticity of actual and law-implied FPM transfers is still

0.31,

expenditure also respond to law-implied FPM transfers: the elasticity is around
to the share of FPM transfers to municipal expenditure (Panel

The estimates on earnings

are quite similar to the baseline estimates

The elasticity

baseline estimate. The elasticity for private employment is around

0.10, somewhat attenuated

and less precisely estimates than the baseline estimate (of

similar to the

0.15).

Excluding Observations of Municipalities that `move up' a Population Bracket.
In a further sensitivity analysis, we run specications dropping municipalities that `move up'
into a higher population bracket. In so doing, we restrict our focus exclusively to variation
across municipalities that either stay in the same bracket or `move down' a bracket. This is
of particular interest as the notion of potential systematic manipulation is a concern about
(`articial' or at least induced)

increases in population, as a municipal government that tried

to play down its number of inhabitants would receive less federal transfers.
Table

17,

In Appendix

we report estimates that are very similar to the baseline estimates of spending,

public/private sector earnings and employment.

In addition, Appendix Table

21

conrms

that the bulk of the eect comes from employment in the service sector.

Controlling for mayor-specic xed eects.

We address a concern regarding may-

ors' characteristics such as ability and political connectedness which, if correlated to labor
market outcomes, can be potentially problematic for our empirical strategy. Controlling for
municipality xed-eects in this case is unlikely to solve the issue as mayors' terms typically
last four years. We proceed to re-estimate our baseline results replacing municipal xed-eects
with mayor-specic xed-eects in each municipality. This is equivalent to municipality xedeects interacted with mayor-term dummies. Appendix Table

18

reports estimates that are

very similar to the baseline results of spending and public sector earnings and employment.

we show a positive and statistically signicant eect on employment

in the service sector.

Global Regression Discontinuity High-Order Control Function Approach.

Some

previous works in political economy that exploit the non-linear allocation of federal transfers
to Brazilian municipalities apply a regression discontinuity approach that uses all observations, both close and far from the cutos. Brollo, Nannicini, Tabellini, and Perotti (2013)
condition on high-order polynomials of population estimates to control for the continuous part
of the allocation mechanism. While this approach is sensitive to the polynomial order and
tends to make inference challenging (Gelman and Imbens, 2014), Appendix Table

16

reports

the `global control function' RD estimates with law-implied FPM transfers and municipal
expenditure expressed in logs (Panel A), public sector (Panel B) and private sector (Panel C)
labor outcomes. The link between outcomes and law-implied FPM transfers is present when
we use observations both close and relatively further away from the seven discontinuities.
The estimates tend to be signicant and fairly larger than our baseline specications.

Regional Spillovers.

In keeping with other studies on `local' scal multipliers such as

Serrato and Wingender (2014), Acconcia, Corsetti, and Simonelli (2014) and Shoag (2012),
we examined whether there are regional spillover eects of federal transfers in nearby municipalities.

To this end, we augment the baseline specications with dependent variables

aggregated at the regional level (meso-region) net of own-municipality outcomes.

49

The idea

is to investigate whether an exogenous change in FPM transfers in a given municipality aects
expenditure and labor market outcomes in neighboring cities.
Table

19

The estimates in Appendix

reveal that spillover eects are statistically indistinguishable from zero. Spillovers

may also arise because of labor relocation and migration. Since we do not have data on intermunicipality migration, directly tackling this issue is challenging.

Yet, socio-demographic

analyses of the Brazilian labor market reveal that the migration trends from small rural areas to large cities that were evident in the 1980s and 1990s slowed down considerably during
the 2000s (Brito and Carvalho, 2006; Filho and Horridge, 2010). Furthermore, as our sample

49 A

meso-region is a subdivision of states dened by the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics) which congregates a few municipalities in a given geographical area with economic and social
similarities. They do not constitute any sort of political or economic entities.
55

consists of small municipalities (less than 50,000 inhabitants), signicant migration between
such small cities seems unlikely, especially at annual frequency.

Finally, the estimates in

this section are also consistent with the view that exogenous shock to local spending do not
signicantly cause labor reallocation from nearby municipalities.

Delayed Eects.

We investigate whether increases in transfers may have a delayed

20, we record coecients of law-implied

eect on labor market outcomes. In Appendix Table
transfers at year

t

on outcomes at year

t + 1.

All estimates are positive but insignicant.

This is in line with the view that the most of the eect is contemporaneous.

Sector-specic Analysis.

We have also examined whether the eect of FPM trans-

fers aect dierently the three main sectors of the local economies. As before we estimate
specications in rst-dierences. Appendix Table

23

reports the log-dierence specications

in columns (1)-(3), as well as OLS and LAD dierence specications in (4)-(9). Changes in
federal transfers and municipal government spending are signicantly correlated with changes
in private sector employment and earnings. The magnitudes and signicance are very similar
to our baseline model estimates in levels reported in Table

10.

This pattern is also robust

to excluding municipalities that `move up' a population bracket and including mayor-specic
xed-eects (Appendix Table

Geography and Size.

21

and

22).

In Appendix Table

24

- Panel A, we show the link between

law-implied and actual FPM transfers (and municipal expenditure) is similar across geographic regions (north and south).

The same is true across smaller (Thresholds 1-3) and

larger (Threhsolds 4-7) as evidenced by Panel B. We present visual evidence regarding the
heterogeneity of the eect of transfers according to geography and size as discussed in section
6 on the main text. Point estimates from Tables

10

and

11

show that federal transfers have

a larger and more signicant eect on private sector earnings and employment in small municipalities, mainly in the southern areas. Appendix Figures A.14a-A.14b corroborate those
ndings showing that average earnings and employment change abruptly once southern municipalities cross a threshold, while the jump is less sharp for northern regions. An even more
striking pattern is revealed by Appendix Figures A.14c-A.14d in which the eect seems to be
concentrated in smaller cities.

The table gives summary statistics for the main variables employed in the empirical analysis. The sample includes 43,466 yearly observations covering 3,279 Brazilian municipalities over the period 1999-2014. Panel A reports the mean and
standard deviation of three sets of variables per population bracket: municipal population growth, sources of municipal revenue as a share of total, income per capita according to the 2000 census and types of expenditure. Sources of municipal
revenue include FPM transfers, local tax revenue which include ISS (service tax) and IPTU (property tax), state-level government transfers and federal-level government transfers (net of FPM) to municipalities. Panel B-D report summary
statistics on municipal public and private sector labor markets outcomes, by employee tenure (old or new hires) and by sub-sector (Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services), respectively. Panel B-D on reports total earnings, total employment and
wage per worker, respectively.

The table reports regression estimates associating actual municipal FPM transfers to law-implied FPM Transfers. The table reports estimates from 5
specifications. Panel A reports estimates without fixed-effects. Row (1) reports OLS coefficient estimates when both the dependent and the independent variable
are expressed in levels (no transformation). Row (2) reports OLS coefficient estimates when both actual FPM transfers (the dependent variable) and law-implied
transfers (the independent variable) are expressed in logs. Row (3) reports least-absolute-deviation (median) estimates associating actual FPM transfers with lawimplied FPM transfers in levels. PANEL B - rows (4) and (5) repeat specifications in (1) and (2) with fixed-effects. We construct municipal law-implied
transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close

The table reports regression estimates associating municipal public finance variables to law-implied FPM Transfers. Panel A reports estimates for municipal
revenues as the dependent variable and Panel B for municipal expenditure. Row (1) in each panel reports OLS coefficient estimates when both the dependent
and the independent variable are expressed in levels (no transformation). Row (2) reports OLS coefficient estimates when both variables are expressed in logs.
Row (3) reports least-absolute-deviation (median) estimates. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see
appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the seven FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report
local regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off.
Columns (5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel. All specifications include state-year fixed effects and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported).

Panel A reports IV-Fuzzy RD coefficients of the impact of actual FPM trasfers instrumented by law-implied transfers on employment in the public and private sector.
Columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) report local estimate in the neighborhood of 4% and 3%, respectively, without and with a rectangular kernel on normalized population.
Columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8) report the equivalent number of jobs created by a transfer of 30,000 Brazilian Reais in 1998 prices (equivalent to USD in 2016 prices) using
the standard elasticity formula. Panel B calculates the corresponding estimated cost of a job for the different specifications and the associated implied output multiplier.
The mapping from emplyment estimated to output multiplier is described in section 5.2. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation
mechanism formula (see appendix). All specifications include municipality, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). Heteroskedasticity-adjusted
standard errors clustered at the micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at 99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*)

The table reports regression estimates associating municipal private sector labor market outcomes to law-implied FPM Transfers according to the type of activity. Panel
A-C report estimates on Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services. Rows (1)-(3) in each panel reports fixed-effect OLS coefficient estimates on Total Earnings,
Employment and Wage per Worker. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports
estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the seven FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local regression (RD) estimates that
restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. Columns (5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel. All
specifications include municipality, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the microregion are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at 99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*) confidence level.

The table reports regression heterogeneity estimates associating municipal private sector labor market outcomes to law-implied FPM Transfers according to
geography. Panel A-C report estimates on Total Earnings, Employment and Wage per Worker. Rows (1) and (2) in each panel reports fixed-effect OLS coefficient
estimates for municipalities in the South and North. Appendix Table 1 reports how each state has been classified as South or North. We construct municipal lawimplied transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both
close and far from the seven FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using

The table reports regression heterogeneity estimates associating municipal private sector labor market outcomes to law-implied FPM Transfers according to municipal
population size. Panel A-C report estimates on Total Earnings, Employment and Wage per Worker. Rows (1) and (2) in each panel reports fixed-effect OLS
coefficient estimates for municipalities around thresholds 1-3 (6,793-20,376 inhabitants) and thresholds 4-7 (6,793-47,537 inhabitants). Appendix Table 2 reports local
sample sizes for each threshold bracket for a 4%-bandwidth. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see
appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the seven FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local
regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. Columns (5)-(7)

Panel A gives the count of observations per year (municipalities-year) in our sample below and above each of the seven FPM population thresholds (10188, 13584, 16980, 23772, 30564, 37356 and 44148) for the full sample. Panel B restricts the
sample within a 4%-neighbourhood of the closest threshold.

This table mirrors table 1 for a restricted sample within a 4%-neighbourhood of the closest threshold. Summary statistics for the main variables employed in the empirical analysis are reported. The sample includes 11,349 yearly observations
covering 2,305 Brazilian municipalities over the period 1999-2014. Panel A reports the mean and standard deviation of three sets of variables per population bracket: municipal population growth, sources of municipal revenue as a share of total,
income per capita according to the 2000 census and types of expenditure. Sources of municipal revenue include FPM transfers, local tax revenue which include ISS (service tax) and IPTU (property tax), state-level government transfers and
federal-level government transfers (net of FPM) to municipalities. Panel B-D report summary statistics on municipal public and private sector labor markets outcomes, by employee tenure (old or new hires) and by sub-sector (Agriculture,
Manufacturing and Services), respectively. Panel B-D on reports total earnings, total employment and wage per worker, respectively.

The table reports regression estimates associating differences in actual municipal FPM transfers to differences in law-implied FPM Transfers. Columns (1)-(3) report OLS coefficient
estimates when both actual FPM transfers (the dependent variable) and law-implied transfers (the independent variable) are expressed in simple differences (no transformation).
Columns (4)-(6) report least-absolute-deviation (median) estimates of simple differences. Columns (7)-(9) report OLS coefficient estimates when both variables are expressed in logs.
We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Specifications restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM
cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. All specifications include state-year fixed effects and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported).
Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at 99% (***), 95% (**)
and 90% (*) confidence level.

The table reports cutoff-specific regression estimates associating actual FPM transfers to law-implied FPM Transfers. We construct municipal law-implied
transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Rows (1) and (2) report estimates specific to observations pooled around Thresholds
1-3 and 44-7, respectively. Rows (3)-(9) report coefficients associated to each of the seven threholds in our sample. Column (1) reports estimates in the full
sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the seven FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local regression (RD) estimates that restrict
estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. Columns (5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel. All
specifications include municipality, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). The table also reports the within (marginal) R2.
Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at
99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*) confidence level.

The table reports cutoff-specific regression estimates associating Municipal Revenue to law-implied FPM Transfers. We construct municipal law-implied
transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Rows (1) and (2) report estimates specific to observations pooled around
Thresholds 1-3 and 44-7, respectively. Rows (3)-(9) report coefficients associated to each of the seven threholds in our sample. Column (1) reports
estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the seven FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local regression (RD)
estimates that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. Columns (5)-(7) include
a rectangular kernel. All specifications include municipality, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). The table also reports the
within (marginal) R2. Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients.
Significantly different from zero at 99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*) confidence level.

The table reports regression estimates associating actual FPM transfers, expenditure and labor market outcomes to law-implied FPM Transfers. The sample is
restricted by dropping observations around thresholds 1. Panel A reports fixed-effect OLS coefficient estimates on actual FPM transfers and Expenditure. Panel B
and C report estimates on Public (Private) Sector Total Earnings, Employment and Wage per Worker. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the
FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the FPM
cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%2%) for each cut-off. Columns (5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel. All specifications include municipality, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not
reported). Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from
zero at 99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*) confidence level.

The table reports regression estimates associating actual FPM transfers, expenditure and labor market outcomes to law-implied FPM Transfers. Panel A reports fixedeffect OLS coefficient estimates on actual FPM transfers and Expenditure. Panel B and C report estimates on Public (Private) Sector Total Earnings, Employment and
Wage per Worker. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the
full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in the
neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. Columns (5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel. All specifications include
mayor-specific, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). Mayor-specific fixed effects are equivalent to municipality fixed-effects interacted with
mayor term dummies. Mayor terms in our sample consist of the following 4-year periods: 1997-2000, 2001-2004, 2005-2008, 2009-2012 and 2013-2016.
Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at 99%

The table reports regression estimates associating regional (at the meso-region level) actual FPM transfers, expenditure and labor market outcomes to local (municipal)
law-implied FPM Transfers. A meso-region is a subdivision of states defined by the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) which congregates a few
municipalities in a given geographical area with economic and social similarities. They do not constitute any sort of poliitcal or economic entities. Panel A reports fixedeffect OLS coefficient estimates on regional actual FPM transfers and Expenditure. Panel B and C report estimates on regional Public (Private) Sector Total Earnings,
Employment and Wage per Worker. All regional variables exclude the local municipalitity. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation
mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4)
report local regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. Columns
(5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel. All specifications include municipality, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). Heteroskedasticity-adjusted
standard errors clustered at the micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at 99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*)
confidence level.

The table reports regression estimates associating private sector labor market outcomes by sector to law-implied FPM Transfers. Rows (1)-(3) reports fixed-effect
OLS coefficient estimates on employment in Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation
mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the FPM cutoffs. Columns
(2)-(4) report local regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each
cut-off. Columns (5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel.All specifications include mayor-specific, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported).
Mayor-specific fixed effects are equivalent to municipality fixed-effects interacted with mayor term dummies. Mayor terms in our sample consist of the following
4-year periods: 1997-2000, 2001-2004, 2005-2008, 2009-2012 and 2013-2016. Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the micro-region are

The table reports regression estimates associating differences in Private Sector Labor Market outcomes to differences in law-implied FPM Transfers. Panel A-C report estimates on
Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services. Rows (1)-(3) report fixed-effect OLS coefficient estimates on Total Earnings, Employment and Wage per Worker. Columns (1)-(3) report
OLS coefficient estimates when both variables are expressed in simple differences (no transformation). Columns (4)-(6) report OLS coefficient estimates when both the dependent the
independent variable are expressed in logs. Columns (7)-(9) report least-absolute-deviation (median) estimates of simple differences. We construct municipal law-implied transfers
applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Specifications restrict estimation in the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%)
for each cut-off. All specifications include state-year fixed effects and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the
micro-region are reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at 99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*) confidence level.

The table reports regression heterogeneity estimates associating actual FPM Transfers and municipal expenditure (dependent variables) to law-implied FPM Transfers
according to geography and municipal population size. Panel A allows coefficients to differ for municipalities in the South/North. Panel B repeats the analysis for
municipalities around thresholds 1-3 (6,793-20,376 inhabitants) and thresholds 4-7 (6,793-47,537 inhabitants). Appendix Table 1 reports the complete North/South
classification. We construct municipal law-implied transfers applying the FPM allocation mechanism formula (see appendix). Column (1) reports estimates in the full
sample that includes municipalities both close and far from the seven FPM cutoffs. Columns (2)-(4) report local regression (RD) estimates that restrict estimation in
the neighborhood of the FPM cutoffs using three relative bandwidths (4%-2%) for each cut-off. Columns (5)-(7) include a rectangular kernel. All specifications
include municipality, state-year and cutoff-year fixed-effects (constants not reported). Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the micro-region are
reported in parentheses below the coefficients. Significantly different from zero at 99% (***), 95% (**) and 90% (*) confidence level.
