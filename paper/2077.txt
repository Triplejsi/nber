seIectl ye ano interpretive account of the devaiopmert of

thought on intarnatonal financial questions. Attention is 4ocusad on
the process of international adjustment and on the proDer definition of

external balance. Since the first descriptions of the once—specie—flow
mechanism in Humes time, the definition of external balance

has evolved

in response to changes in the world economys structure. The foreign
reserve constraint so central under the gold standard or in the early
Bretton Woods years is less important under conditions of high international capital mobility. Increasingly, the current account and the
national intertemporal budget constraint are emphasized in discussions
of international adjustment. In analogy with the idea of a high—
employment government budget surplus, a working definition of external
balance might be a current account that maintains the highest possible

steady consumption level consistent with the economys expected inter—
temporal budget constraint. Intertemporal approaches to external balance
become more difficult to apply when countries face credit rationing as a
result of nonrepayment risk.

Introduction. International finance is concerned with the deter-

mination of real income and the allocation of consumption over time In
economies linked to world markets. Fundamental to international finance

is the somewhat elusive iaea of external balance, which In practice
entails a path of external indebtedness that does not threaten a

countrys ability to meet its international obligations. Because the
nature of the linkages among economies has varied across historical
episodes, the requirements of external balance have varied as well.
International finance studies the policies and market forces which may
lead to external balance under various conditions. The history of the
subject illustrates how the nature of world market linkages has itself
been changed by national efforts to cope with external constraints.
The national Income identity is the necessary groundwork for any
discussion of external balance. The national income of an open economy
equals domestic product plus net factor payments from abroad plus net
international transfer payments; the current account equals net exports
of goods and services (including all net factor payments) plus net
transfers. If national expenditure is defined as the sum of consumption
and investment (by both the public and private sectors), the national
income identity asserts that national income less natiânal expenditure
equals the current account. When in surplus, the current account therefore measures the growth of the economy's external assets; when in
deficit, it measures the growth of external debt.

The Classical

Paradigm.

The

classical Ricardo—Mill Darter

trade

theory shows how the terms of trade and international production pattern
are determined in a stationary world economy with balanced trade. The
classical analysis of •the transition to balanced trade say be viewed as

an account of the convergence process to the long—run barter equilibrium. As Ricardo noted in the Principles (1811)1

Sold and silver having been chosen for the general medium of
circulation, they are, by the competition of commerce, distributed
in such proportions amongst the different countries of the world
as to accommodate themselves to the natural traffic which would
take place if no such metals existed, and the trade between
countries were purely a trade of barter.

Historically, however, the classical paradigm of external adjustment
preceded Ricardo. Major elements of the theory had been expounded quite
clearly by the early eighteenth century, but the most coherent and
effective exposition was given by Hume in 1752.
Hume assumed a world economy that settles trade imbalances exclusively through imports or exports of precious metals that also serve
as money. Building on the quantity theory of money, he constructed a
full

dynamic model of the balance of payments and the terms of trade.

The famous price—specie—flow mechanism was put forth as an automatic
market process that always works to restore balanced trade. Humes goal
was to refute mercantilist and protectionist arguments by showing that

market forces would ensure inthe long run a 'natural' distribution of
specie among countries.

Hume invited his readers to imagine that four—fifths of 6reat

Britains money supply were 'annihilated in one night.' British prices
would naturally fall1 he argued, cheapening British exportables relative
to foreign goods and creating a trade surplus..As a result of this

the reverse process. involvinq an initial improvement in ritsinc terms
of trade and a trade balace deficit. Over time, specie would flow abroad
as the terms of trade deteriorated and external equilibrium was restored.

There is litti exaggeration in saying that issues raised by Humes
analysis dominated writing in international finance up until the inter—
World War years. In a period that culminated in the classical gold
standard, it was natural to take as the benchmark of external balance an
absence of international specie movements. Hume had placed relative
price movements at the center of his account of how external balance
would be attained, but subsequent writers asked whether direct income or

wealth effects might also b operative, and whether external adjustment
could take place in some cases without price changes. Such questions
arose in the 1929 Keynes—Ohlin debate over the German transfer problem,
but as Viner (1937) showed, the questions had been raised much earlier.
A simple model of a Humean world makes apparent some of

the

assump-

tions underlying the price—specie—flow mechanism. Such a model also
serves as a springboard for understanding later developments in the
analysis of external adjustment. (A more detailed exposition of a

similar model is given by Darnbusch, 1973, whose analytical approach is
however, somewhat different from that taken here,)

Assume a world of two countries, each specialized in the production

-.4-

of a single commodity that is consumed in both countries. With given
supplies of capital and labor within each country and perfect wage
fiexiblity, floine—country output is fi::.ed at the fuil—emoloyment level x

and foreign—country output is fixed at y. Let q denote the price of y—
z domestic expenditure

goods in terms of x—qoods (the terms of trade
measured in v—goods, and 2*

foreign

expenditure, also measured in x—

the foreign demands arec*(q,z*) and c *(q,z*).
A

Expenditure is determined by monetary conditions. The money supplies M and M* are for simplicity taken to consist entirely of gold, and
P and P* denote the gold prices of home and foreign goods, respectively.
The exchange rate between domestic and foreign currency can be set at
unity with no loss of generality, so the terms of trade, q, equal P*/P.

In each country there is a desired long run (or natural") money supply

causes a gradual redistribution of money in favor of the home country,
so the home terms of trade improve during the transition to external
balance.

The Bretton Woods Period. The interwar experience had a profound
influence on both the institutional framework of postwar international
finance and the theoretical orientation of researchers. The international agreement reached at Bretton Woods in 1944 set up a world trading
community linked by fixed dollar exchanqe rates, with a United States
commitment to peg the dollar price gold at $35 per ounce providing an

anchor for the world price level. The agreements provisions aimed to
promote free trade in goods, but private capital movements were viewed
as potentially disruptive and the widespread capital controls then in
force were not discouraged. A prevailing view that flexible exchange
rates had failed during the interwar period motivated the adoption of a
fixed—rate system. Provision was made, however, for infrequent exchange—
rate adjustment, after due consultation, in circumstances of 'fundamen—

tal disequilibrium in the balance of payments.
Central to the design of the Bretton Woods system was a desire to
avoid unemployment and ensure price—level stability. In the interwar
years, many governments had resorted to competitive currency depreciations and trade restrictions aimed at reducing domestic unemployment.

These Hbeggar_thy_neighbor moves made all countries worse off. Having
recently experienced the hardships of the worldwide Sreat Depression,

the Bretton Woods signatories recognized the goal of internal balance'—

—l 1—

—uil employment with price stability——as a key aim of government
policy. .n International Monetary Fund was set up to reconcile the goals
of internal and external balarce. It was hoped that the availability of
Fund credit would make it unnecessary for members to tolerate high
unemployment in pursuing external balance, or to interfere with trade
flows in pursuing internal balance.

in an environment of fixed exchange rates and extremely limited
capital mobility, the overriding external consideration for governments
was the available stock of foreign, particularly dollar, reserves. The
operative external target was therefore the acquisition of as many
dollars as possible throuah balance—of—payments surpluses. As the
reserve center, the United States enjoyed the privilege of being able to
finance its own balance—of—payments deficits by borrowing dollars from
foreign central banks. In reality, however, the United States was not
totally free of a reserve constraint. Foreign central banks could, and

din. use their dollars to buy gold from the U.S authorities at the
official price. The problem of gold losses became important as the

oostwar period of dollar shortage ended in the late 1950s. In 1960,

Inc important feature of the classical mechanism
is the central
role it attributes to the monetary system. The classical theory
contains ar explicit acceptance of the Quantity Theory of Money as
well as an implied assumption that output and employment are unaffected by international monetary disturbances. In other words,
the classical doctrine assumes that an increase or decrease in the
quantity of money leads to an increase or decrease in the aggregate
money demand for goods and services, and that a change in money demand
affects prices and costs rather than output and employment.... The
essence of the new theory is that an external event which increases
a countrys exports will also increase imports even without price
charges, since the change in exports affects the level of output and
hence the demand for all goods. In other words, movements of output
arid employment play the same role in the new doctrine that price
movements played in the old.

n increase in external demand for a. countrys exports, for example,
would raise the couatrys trade surplus in the first instance, but once
the

multiplier effect of the disturbance had raised income and hence

import

spending, the initial impact on

the trade balance would be

reduced. tletzier noted, however, that even if one assumed that invest-

ment spending responds positively to a rise in real income, it was
unlikely that multiplier effects alone would ensure complete trade—
balance adjustment in the short run.
The

important

Keynesian account of

external adjustment therefore contained an

gap. Private capital movements were largely ruled out in the

Keynesian models, so incomplete trade—balance adjustment implied incom-

A

-fivefold increase in a countrys money supply, -for example,

domestic money supply,

the interest rate, investment, and output have

returned to their oriqinal levels. The introduction of dynamic adjustment made it clear that sterilization could have only limited success as
a policy response to permanent balance—of—payments di sturba.nces. One

source of dynamic effects, however, was not explicitly analyzed in
Mundelis work of the period. The omitted effect was the real—balance
effect on expenditure,

central to

the

classical account but possibly

relevant (as Pigou had shown) under Keynesian conditions as well.
In line with the increasing international capital mobility that
followed the European move toward currency convertibility in 1958,
riundell gave the capital account a prominent role in his models. The

presence of capital mobility suggested a solution to the policy dilemmas
that could arise under fixed exchange rates when the goals of internal
and external balance appeared to conflict. Mundell showed that by gearing monetary policy to external balance and fiscal policy to internal
balance3 governments could simultaneously attain both goals. The key to
the argument is the observation that monetary and fiscal expansion both
raise output but have different effects on the capital account, monetary
expansion causing capital outflows (by driving down the home interest
rate> and fiscal expansion causing capital inflows (by raising the
interest rate). With two independent instruments, both internal and
external policy targets can be attained simultaneously.

seemed unlikely that capital would flow at a uniform level

discussion of stock equilibrium in international asset markets. The
second problem with the policy mix was its definition of external

balance. Would any policymaker view with satisfaction a permanently high
interest rate that brought about balance—of—payments equilibrium by
crowding out domestic investment and encouraging a buildup of external
debt? Key considerations omitted from Mundeli s model vere the stock of
net foreign claims and the associated flows of interest payments. Mun—

definition

of external balance as balance—of—payments equilibrium might

be inadequate

Just as the composition of output is important (the division of
output between investment and consumption affects additional
growth tarqets) so an appropriate composition of the balance of

capital mobility, a central bank short on reserves can (within limits)
bnrrow them from abroad at no net cost simply by contracting domestic
credit. Such an action, by causing an incipient rise in the home interest rate, leads to an instantaneous private capital inflow and an official reserve gain equal to the fall in domestic credit. The home Interest rate, the money supply, output, and the national external debt are
unchanged in the final equilibriumi the central bank holds more foreign
assets and fewer domestic assets, while the home private sector, having
made the mirror—image adjustment, holds fewer foreign assets and more
domestic assets.

The case of perfect capital mobility is an extreme one that does
not fit the facts of the late Bretton Woods period. Nonetheless, the
opportunities for central banks other than the Federal Reserve to borrow
dollar reserves in the International capital market had grown since the
early 1960s. The situation facing the United States was quite different.
As the primary International reserve Issuer, its responsibility was to
peg the dollar price of gold, a responsibility that would have required
the gearing of U.S. monetary policy to that external commitment. In
spite of such expedients as the two—tier gold market established by
central banks In 1968, the U.S. did not succeed in preserving the
dollar's link to gold. Triffin had been right. After a series of violent
speculative attacks, the U.S. severed the dollar's gold link in August
1971 and in December 1971 devalued the dollar against major foreign
currencies. The patchwork system of fixed exchange rates proved unstable, and in the first months of 1973 the postwar period of floating
exchange rates began.

—17—

ing dollar exchange rates as an interim measure, but in fact a significant body of economists had come to advocate floating rates by 1973.
Friedman's (1953) powerful case for flexible rates was the opening shot
in a campaign to revise the then—prevailing view, expounded by Nurkse
(1944), that the floating—rate experiments of the interwar years were
disastrous. By the time Johnson wrote his well—known polemic of 1969,
Friedman's views had gained many adherents.
The fundamental argument for floating rates was that they would
free governments of the balance—of—payments constraint and allow them to
use monetary policy to attain domestic economic goals. Equilibrium in
the balance of payments would be automatic if central banks simply
refrained from intervening In the foreign exchange market. At the same
•time, floating rates would permit central banks to target their nominal
money supplies without being frustrated by offsetting interest—sensitive
foreign reserve flows. Widespread restrictions on trade and capital
movements, motivated in part by a desire to impede reserve flows under
the fixed—rate regime, could be dismantled.
Subsequent experience was to provide only partial vindication to
the advocates of floating. In the decade after 1973, barriers to capital
movement were reduced to insignificant levels in many of the industrial
countries. This development helped spark unprecedented growth in international financial intermediation. Under the new exchange—rate regime,
however, policymakers became mere acutely aware that the traditional
definition of internal balance as full employment cum price stabilty
really involved two, quite distinct, goals. Under a floating exchange
rate4 monetary expansion aimed at domestic unemployment translates
immediately into currency depreciation, higher import prices, and
heightened inflationary expectations. Conversely1 a rapidly—adjusting

(although the composition of

exchange rates did not necessarily imply an operative balance—of—

effects could have been achieved at an unchanged reserve level

Under conditions of limited capital mobility, such

as those exist-

ing in the early 1950s when Friedman wrote, the automatic balancing of
international reserve payments by a

floating

exchange

rate

amounted

essentially to the automatic balancing of the current account. With
means other than reserve flows available to settle current—account

imbalances, however, there is no theoretical necessity for a floating
rate to balance the current account in the short run. A current—account
deficit,

say, can be financed

with no decline in the central banks foreign assets. Experience was to

show that floatinQ exchange rates themselves could not prevent the
eaerqence of

and persistent current—account imbalances. Tiese

imbalances were problematic not only because they usually entailed

problems of shifting productive resources between the economys tradable
and nontradable sectors, but also because they implied changes in for—
eiqn debt and thus in sustainable future consumption levels.

Further complications arise when the classical assumptions are dropped
and Keynesian price stickiness in output markets is assumed. In such
models, the approach to the long—run, full—employment equilibrium can be
oscillatory.

For a single economy with Keynesian features, there is an analogue
to the Nundellian Idea of using monetary and fiscal policy simultaneously to attain internal and external targets. Figure 2, which is
developed more fully in Obstfeld (1985, pp. 408—410), illustrates this
approach. The downward sloping internal—balance schedule shows combinations of monetary and fiscal ease consistent with full employment. On
the assumption that monetary ease improves the current account by
depreciating the currency, the external—balance schedule, which shows
policy settings consistent with some current—account target, slopes
upward. The intersection of the two schedules shows how policies should
be set to achieve both of the government's goals in the short run.
Even if one leaves aside the complex game—theoretic problems surrounding interactions between expectations and policy, the usefulness of
the above framework as a normative guide is limited by its failure to
incorporate some key dynamic elements. If the government can hit its
targets only by running a budget deficit, its fiscal stance must eventually be reversed if the government debt is to be serviced. In addition, the policy equilibriam shown in Figure 2 may Imply a domestic
investment rate that is socially sub—optimal. Finally, the framework
itself gives no guidance as to the appropriate external—balance
criterion. The balanced current account reached in the hypothetical
long-run equilibrium of a stationary world economy may be far off the
eark in the short run in which policy decisions must be sade. Recently,

The Intertemporal Analysis of External Balances In the 1980s, it

became increasingly common to analyze the dynamic behavior of open
economies in terms of the intertemporal maximization hypothesis applied

by Fisher (1930) to the theory of saving and investment, As usuai this
trend was the result of both new theoretical approaches in macroeconomics generally and of economic events that existing open—economy
models seemed ill—equipped to analyze.

Lucass (1576) influential critique of econometric policy evaluation was important in motivating the intertemporal approach. Lucas
argued

that

the standard econometric models of the time would generally

rot oe invariant to policy changes. Because the parameters estimated

were not the deep parameters describing preferences or technology but
instead reflected both deep structure and the policy environment
prevailing over the estimation period! the models could not he used to

balance must begin by

technological and market opportunities for

shifting consumptIon over time. These opportunities are described by the

mconomys intertemporal budget constraint, which specifies the terms on
which the economy can borrow or lend abroad, as well as the domestic
investment technology. Separate analysis of the public and private
sector's budget constraints illuminates the link between the public
finances and external imbalance, as measured by the balance of payments
or by the current account. The economy—wide budget constraint results

from consolidation of the public— and private—sector constraints.
Assume for simplicity that a single good is consumed and produced

on each date, and consider the position of a small open economy that can
borrow or lend internationally at the real interest rate p. For each
date t, the government of the economy chooses a level of real government
consumption, g(t), and a (possibly negative) level of real transfers to
the priveite sector, 7(t). The government finances its outlays by issuing

debt, by printing money, and by drawing on the interest paid by the
central bank 's foreign reserves. (For present purposes, the central

The inequality states that the present value of net government

money creation plus the government's intial asset position. The latter
quantity, in turn, equals central—bank foreign reserves less the public

Inequality 4) states that the present value of the economys
expenditures cannot exceed the present value of output plus initial

net

external assets. Alternatively (6) constrains the present value of the
economys trade balance deficits to its initial foreign asset stock. The
initial foreign asset stock thus limits the economys ability to maintain absorption levels

in excess

of output.

An implicatior! of the analysis is that the most appropriate in-

dicator cf flow disequilibrium in external transactions is the change in
the economy s overall external assets——the current account. A surplus in
the balance of payments may indicate low domestic credit expansion or
growing domestic money demand; but when the government has unilimited
access to the world capital market, a growing stock of foreign reserves

is in itself, neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a

external

sound

position. Only when the domestic government and private

sector cannot borrow abroad does the balance of payments equal the
change in external claims.

The important consequences of current—account flows do not imply
that external balance and current—account

balance are the same. In

analogy wxth the idea of a high—employment government budget surplus,
external balance could be defneb roughly as

a current

account that

maintains the highest possible steady consumption level consistent with
the economy s expected intertempora.i budget constraint. (A more exact

These points car be made graphically in terms of a two—period

goods available, present and future consumption, and the indifference
curves show preferences over those goods. Investment opportunities are
described by the production—possibilities frontier, which indicates the

amount of future con;umpton obtained from a given input of present
consumption. With the opportunity to borrow abroad at an interest rate

operate directly on the distortions in question (if these can be identified) will, as usual, be best. Interesting problems arise when the
countries being analyzed are large enough that their governments can
affect world real interest rates (and other world prices) through their
actions. In this situation, the normative guidelines offered by the
above approach are not directly applicable to policy analysis3 and
governments instead condition their actions on the conjectured responses
of other governments. A Nash—Cournot equilibrium, in which each govern—
meat maximizes over policy settings taking as given the policies of
other governments, will in general be Pareto—inefficient from a global
viewpoint. When governments recognize their policy interdependence,
welfare in each country can be improved though policy cooperation. The
practical difficulty lies in the negotiation process through which all
parties agree to choose a particular point on the world contract curve.

Sovereign Borrowing and Credit Constraints. The intertemporal
analysis of external balance sketched above assumes a world in which
individuals or at least governments can borrow unlimited amounts in the
world capital market, subject only to their interteniporal budget con—

striats. Individual and sovereign borrowers alike however, often
appear to face binding credit constraints as a result of nonrepayment
risk. After the early 1980s, the extreme difficulty for many in—

—29—

dustrializinq countries of tapping world credit markets focused attention on how countries' borrowing possibilities are affected by the
possibility of sovereign debt default. The problem is a central one

because most developing—country debts are either contracted drect1y by

agencies or are government—guaranteed.

hypothesized that a sovereign debtor defaults whenever the present
discounted benefit of doing so exceeds the present discounted cost.

Potential lenders understanding the debtor's decision rule, will never
lend so much that a sure incentive to default is created. ccordingly,
sovereign borowers will in general find themselves credit—rationed,
unable to borrow as much as they would like at the interest rate quoted
by lenders.

The analysis of external balance becoces much

more complex in such

a setting. Not only s the allowable current—account deficit more
severely circumscribed; in addition, the policymaker must consider how
various policy actions

will

affect the costs of default and hence the

availability of foreign credit. Trade liberalization measures that move
the economy away from an autarkic production allocation increase the
cost of default by making the economy more vulnerable to disruption of
its foreign trade. Such measures will therefore ease international

credit constraints at the same time as they improve the static allocation of national resources. Conversely, trade restrictions aimed at

improving the current account may well reduce a countrys creditworthiness.

The traditional balance—of—payments target has a rationale if the

government believes that foreign credit lines may disappear unexpec—

tedly There is then a case for holding precautionary reserves to
finance current—account deficits that may become necessary at times when
credit happens to be tight or nonexistent. The same purpose would be
served, however, if foreign assets held by government agencies other
than the central bank were run down at such times.
Internal and external balance may be irreconcilable for countries

ttat seek to continue external debt service in the face of severe
limItations on -forexgn borrowing. fter the early 1980s, many developing

consumption—smoothing can be obtained with smaller current—account
imbalances, however, if there is a greatmr degree of international
portfolio diversification. Lucas (1982), for example, models a world of
two exchange economies with perfect International risk sharing in which
consumption levels can be perfectly correlated internationally even
though current—account Imbalances never take place. The problem of
external balance thmref ore never arises in Lucas's idealized setting. In

reality, the extent of international portfolio diversification seems to
be much smaller than plausible financial models of an integrated world
capital market would predict. Why this should be so Is a major empirical
puzzle, and a problem for policy as well.
