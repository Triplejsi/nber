Tobints Q and Financial Policy

ABSTRACT

Recent research in macroeconomics has emphasized the importance of
linking the financial and real sectors and the need for working with

optimizing models. Tobin's Q model of investment would appear to provide a
framework that can

satisfy

these two criteria. In contrast to the original

presentation of the Q model, the formal development has not recognized that

the

firm actively participates in a number of financial markets; in this

broader context, we show that Q Is likely to be an uninformative and

possibly

misleading signal

for

Investment expenditures. We then endeavor

to turn this negative theoretical result to positive advantage in resolving
a number of empirical problems with Q models, but the modifications
dictated by the theory receive little support from the data.

TOBIN'S Q AND FINANCIAL POLICY

INTRODUCTION

I.

Uncovering

the channels through which financial and monetary variables

affect real behavior has been of considerable interest during the past few
years, as radical changes in financial markets and monetary policies have been

associated with sudden swings in macroeconomic activity. Following the
insights of Keynes
investigated

(1936) arid

Tobin (1969), a number of researchers have

these linkages using the Q model, which relates investment in

physical capital to the ratio of the market value of financial claims on the
firm

the cost of reproducing its existing stock of capital.1 When this

exceeds unity, investors in

financial markets are

indicating that

prospective cash flows are likely to be sufficiently high or discount rates
sufficleuLLy low to warrant additional capital spending.
The Q framework is particularly appealing because the abovementioned link
between financial variables and investment can be derived from a model of

forward—looking, maximizing behavior. Based on a

cash flow model in

which the

firm faces convex costs in adjusting its capital stock, it has been shown that
physical investment is determined by marginal Q, defined as the ratio of the
discounted future revenues from an additional unit of capital (i.e., the shadow

price of capital) to its net—of—tax purchase price (Mussa, 1977; bel, 1979).
Critical to the empirical usefulness of this model is that unobservable
marginal Q must be related to observable average Q, defined above as the ratio
of

financial to physical capital. The conditions under which this connection

can be drawn have been established in an important paper by Hayashl (1982).
From a theoretical perspective, Q Investment models are appealing because they
Incorporate forward—looking behavior, reflect optimal choices, and contain
estimated coefficients that are readily identified with underlying structural
parameters 2
In contrast to the original presentation of the Q model, the formal
development has not recognized that the firm actively participates In a number
of

financial markets. This paper develops a model

In

which the firm chooses,

not only the level of Investment expenditures, but also its debt and equity

policies. We find that endogenizing financial policy calls into question the
usefulness of the Q framework, and

show that Q

is likely to be an uninformative

and perhaps misleading signal for investment expenditures.

This negative theoretical result, however, can have a potentially
positive

Impact on the empirical performance of conventional Q models, which

have been disappointing on three counts. First, contrary to the theory, lagged
variables have proven significant determinants of Investment;3 the
interpretation of these coefficients In terms of the underlying structural

model becomes unclear. Second, relative to alternative investment models, Q
has not performed adequately In terms of either

within sample or out—of-sample

2See Lucas (1976) and Sargent (1981) for a discussion of the advantages of
estimating and identifying structural parameters.
3For example, see von Furstenberg (1977) and Blanchard and Wyplosz (1981),
whose results are based on U.S. quarterly data. Significant lagged variables
have also emerged In studies of other countries (United Kingdom, Poterba and
Summers, 1983; MexIco, Schwartzrnan, 198's). Fischer (1983) has argued that
lagged Q should be an important determinant of Investment spending. There
are two objections to his result. First, he enters lags into the maximization
problem by assuming that adjustment costs depend on both current and lagged
investment, but it is not at all clear what phenomena are being captured by
this formulation. Second, the investment schedule that follows from his model
is quite different fran those actually used in econometric work, and thus the
relation between his result and empirically significant lagged variables is not

apparent.

statistics (Clark, 1979). Third, the implied structural parameters are quite

unreasonable. For example, Summers'

(1981,

P. 101) estimated adjustment cost

coefficient implied that, twenty years after an unexpected change in the
economic environment, the capital stock would have moved only three—fourths of

the way to its ultimate, steady—state value. In sum, these empirical problems
reveal a serious misspecificatiori in conventional formulations of the Q model.

Our analysis of endogenous financial policy allows us to link the specification
error to omitted variables and to exploit this additional information in
econometric estimation.

by assuming that, in formulating real and financial

and

value of equity subject to four constraints. First, the firm's

technology [L(t), K(t), 1(t), D(t), d(t)]) depends positively on labor (L(t))
and capital (K(t)) inputs, and negatively on the remaining three arguments. We
assume that, when Incorporating investment goods (1(t)) into the production
process, the firm incurs adjustment costs, which Increase at an increasing

rate. These internal costs can be viewed as the movement of real resources
from producing output toward Installing capital goods, and hence have a

deleterious effect on •[t]. We further assume that the presence of debt (D(t))
in the firm's capital structure creates agency problems (Jensen and Meckling,
1976; Myers1 1977) that lead to restrictions on the firm's operations (e.g.,

discussion of alternative cost of capital definitions.

costs annul the well—known capital structure invariance result of Modigliani
and Miller and, since we will be assuming that the demand for securities is

perfectly elastic, they are borne entirely by the firm. Negative effects on

Third, the cost of equity capital (p(t)) is constrained by the return

that investors require to hold financial assets. This return is determined by
the rates of taxation, inflation, and time preference faced by investors, and
thus p(t) is Invariant to the conduct of policies affecting physical investment

Equation (na) defines the marginal benefit of an additional unit of capital as

The marginal benefit of issuing debt equals the receipts (at par) less

flotation and transactions costs (5a). The marginal carrying costs of this
additional unit of debt are given in (5b) as real interest and retirement

costs associated with debt, all discounted by

payments plus the marginal agency

of capital and weighted

by the debt survival factor, exp(—fl).

Debt policy is conducted in order to equate the marginal costs of equity

and debt. This intuitively plausible result can be seen to hold in the present
model by differentiating (5b) with respect to time and rearranging,

The left and right sides of equation (6b) define the costs of equity and debt,

respectively. The term in braces represents the marginal carrying costs of
debt grossed—up to reflect the loss due to flotation costs that reduce receipts

below the par value of debt. Retirement payments of n per dollar of real debt
lower future debt costs; in the absence of flotation costs, retirement payments

would disappear from (6b). The final term represents the capital gain or loss
arising from alterations in the stock of debt, and ensures that (6b) will hold
along the optimal path. In the steady—state where ii(t) = 0 (and ignoring
momentarily agency and flotation costs), the equality bet.ieen the costs of

equity and debt is apparent, p(t) =

B. Implications for Q Theory
A particularly attractive feature of Tobin's Q theory is that the

unobserved shadow

price

for physical investment can be linked uniquely and

rigorously to observable variables useful in econometric estimation. When
financial policy is endogenous, however, we show In this sub-section that such

a convenient relationship no longer holds. Key to our demonstration is
Proposition I, following from maximizing behavior, that defines the market
values of debt (D(t)) and equity (V(t)) in terms of current—period stocks and
shadow prices,

In (7), the capitalized value of the firm equals the flow of income to be

costs that have been absorbed in order to attain the current level of debt.
Under certain restrictions, it has been shown that physical investment is
related to the ratio of the shadow price of capital to the relative price of

investment goods (Mussa, 1977; Abel, 1979). This ratio is referred to as
marginal Q (Q(t)) but, since the shadow price of capital is unobservable,
QM(t)

is

not

operationally useful. This problem has

been overcome in empirical

work by replacing marginal Q with average Q (QA(t)), defined as "the ratio of
the market value of firms to the replacement cost of their assets" (von

Furstenberg, 1977, p. 3i7). In terms of our notation, these two definitions
can be stated as follows,

QM(t) =

A(t)

QA(t) —

(9)

Proposition II indicates that QM(t), which serves as the signal for alterations
in K(t), is related to QA(t) and an additional term containing an unobserved

shadow price. When financial policy is exogenous, this latter term does not
appear, and marginal and average Q are

equivalent.9

statistic" for indicating profitable investment opportunities in physical
capital.1°

Not only can QA(t) be uninformative, it may also be misleading. In order
to demonstrate that QA(t) can increase while QM(t) remains fixed, we assume
that the technology takes the following separable form,

Assume that the firm is in a steady-state (A) and that the nominal rate of

interest it pays on debt unexpectedly decreases.12 In this scenario, (5b)
implies that the fall in i(t) will lower initially the marginal cost of debt
finance (-i(t)); in terms of the diagram, -ii(t) falls instantaneously from A to
B on the transition path to the new steady-state (C). From (14a) and under our

separability assumptions, A(t) and QM(t) will be unaffected. Immediately after
the fall in 1(t) and —i(t) but before the firm can alter D(t), QA(t) must rise
in order to maintain (9) and to reflect the cheaper finance now available to

the firm.13 As the firm acquires debt along the transition path to the new

where cz(t) is the difference between the financial value of the firm and its

costs were valued by the price of investment goods rather than output, (t) in
(12) would be replaced by QA(t).) The first term in (12) represents
replacement investment, which is proportional to the capital stock; (t)
indicates the profitable level of investment activity — both physical and
financial -

the firm. The last term is the unobservable shadow price

the (J's were all homogeneous of degree one. While this assumption may be
plausible for the production and adjustment cost technologies, it is arguably

inappropriate in regard to debt-related costs. If flotation and agency costs
have a large fixed—cost component, then a÷Y may be less than one; if marginal
flotation costs are positive and agency costs increase at an increasing rate,

then aY may be greater than one. To allow for the possibility that a+11,

Note that Propositions I and II are special cases of Propositions I' and II'

when ai=1 ((t)=O), and thus it will be straightforward to test the assumption
of Increasing debt costs. When we allow for the possibility of this more
general situation, the marginal value of an additional unit of physical capital
is lowered by the differential debt costs —

those that differ from constant

average cost — summed and discounted over the life of the firm. Since X(t)

extends over an infinite horizon, QM(t) in (15) is related to both current and

future variables. Believing that a substantial amount of the variation in x(t)
can be captured by current movements in the rate of discount and stock of debt,

we compute (t) under the assumption that p(s)=p(t), D(s)D(t), and d(s)—nD(t),

Equation (16) stands in sharp contrast to previously estimated investment
models utilizing an adjustment cost technology (11) but maintaining an

exogenous financial policy. In the latter case, debt ratios affect investment
decisions through the purchase price of new capital (p(t)) in much the same way

as investment tax credits.16 If the cost of debt is lower than equity, the
marginal investment expenditure receives a subsidy equal to the capitalized
difference in financing costs, a profit opportunity that firms constrained by

an exogenous financial policy fail to exploit. When the choice of financing is

compromises the structural interpretation of (16).
l6See Ch.trinko (19814), whose formula differs from that of Summers (1981) and

Poterba and Summers (1983). The current analysis suggests that Poterba and
Summers' tests of the effects of dividend taxation within the Q framework may
be biased by their assumption of an exogenous financial policy. For example,
in 1965, changes in the United Kingdom tax code penalized dividends while
favoring debt finance (King, 1977, Table 7.1).

indicates that the conventional Q model is misspecif led. It

is possible that the emergence of significant lagged variables in previously

Q models and their generally disappointing empirical performance may

be due to the omitted debt terms in (16). Furthermore, a standard analysis of

omitted variables bias suggests that the conventional Q specification is likely
to generate estimated values of the adjustment cost parameter (ce) that are
biased upward.17 Whether endogenizing financial policy within the Q framework

results presented in the next sub—section.

B. Econometric Results
The structural equation following from the theoretical model was

with annual data for the nonfinancial corporate sector over the

estimated

period 1950—1981. The length of the sample was dictated by data availability,

and detailed information concerning data sources is contained in the Glossary.

While the theory implies that all capital inputs affecting the firm should be
included

in the series for the capital stock and investment flow, data

availability forces us to define capital as either equipment + structures (the
ES model) or equipment + structures ÷ inventories (the ESI model). As we shall
see, the lessons to be drawn from this paper are robust with respect to the
definition

of capital.

Estimates of the nonlinear model (16) are presented in Table I, and are
computed

by full information maximum likelihood, which, under the present

circumstances, is equivalent to nonlinear least squares.18 A number of the
17Thls conclusion is based on the assumption of a positive correlation between

changes in the economic environment.20 Adjusted f or the difference in the mean

we can evaluate the following three hypotheses stated in terms of I and a:

null hypothesis of no serial correlation. The rn—statistic is calculated in a
regression of the residuals from an equation with a lagged dependent variable (16)
on all of the explanatory variables in the initial regression plus the lagged
residual; m is the t—statistic on the lagged residual. Performing a t—test on
this coefficient is asymptotically equivalent to the Durbin h—test. However,
it can be calculated f or all possible values of the estimated parameters, and
has performed better than the h-statistic in Monte Carlo experiments (Harvey,
1981, P. 276).

20Summers' (1981) preferred estimate of a is 32.258. AdJusted for the
difference in the means of (t), the comparable a's from Table I are 133.761

the model is estimated with Instrumental variables, however, this significant

disappears.23

Second, while demand conditions are explicitly accounted

for in the derivation of the Q model, It is possible that (t) is unable to
capture the full extent of this influence. For the ES model In Table IV, the

the presence of serially correlated residuals, It would be preferable to lag
the instruments an additional period. However, the correlations between these
instruments and the variables in (16) were too weak to deliver any reliable

results.

22Parallel results for the ESI model can be found in the Appendix. For both
the ES and ESI models, 2(t-1)/K(t) and a time trend were entered separately as

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Recent research in macroeconomics has emphasized the need for working

with optimizing models and the importance of linking the financial and real
sectors of the economy. Tobin's Q model of investment would appear to provide
a

framework that could satisfy these two criteria. However, when the firm

We have endeavored to turn this negative theoretical result to positive
advantage in resolving a number of problems with the empirical performance of Q
models. In the presence of eridogenous financial policy, a structural
investment model can

debt-related variables. Unfortunately, such modifications to the conventional

GLOSSARY AND DATA SOURCES
For ease of exposition, the model developed in the text avoided
considering taxes, an omission that can not be maintained in the econometric

analysis. Tax variables enter the structural econometric model (16) only
through c(t), and three modifications are

necessary

—

lowering

the replacement

cost of capital to reflect the subsidies provided by the investment credit and

depreciation allowances; adjusting the price of output to reflect the rate of
corporate income taxation; and subtracting from c2(t) the value of tax

depreciation allowances on real assets purchased prior to t. The calculation
of this latter term is somewhat involved, and the use of available series would

have shortened the sample period. Since the bulk of the variation in (t) is
attributable to the financial assets, the adjustment for the value of existing
depreciation

allowances has not been made. Comparing regressions based on this

adjustment to those contained in Table I indicates that the results, while

slightly improved, are not appreciably affected. The correlation of Q(t)'s
with and without this adjustment is always greater than .95 (time series for
the value of existing depreciation allowances were taken from CO and HA). As
far

as possible, all data pertain to the nonfinancial corporate sector.

APPENDIX. ESTIMATION ISSUES AND ADDITIONAL RESULTS
All computations were performed with version 14.OE of' TSP on the VAX 780

at the Hoover Institution. The Davidon—Fleteher--powell algorithm was used, and

the convergence criteria was set at .05 percent. In order to obtain consistent
estimates of the standard errors, the converged model was iterated an
additional time using the method proposed by Berndt, Hall, Hall, and Hausman

(197L). These were generally larger than those obtained under nonlinear least
squares.

Two problems were encountered in performing the computations. First,
direct estimates of n were not obtainable, and a grid search was conducted over

a range of admissible values. This range was restricted by the flotation/
agency cost function (13), which, if d(t)>0, implies that r)>—D(t)/D(t). Given
our time series for D(t), r must equal or exceed .15, a value implying that,

after 20 years, 95% of a debt issue would be retired. The model was estimated
for 's between .15 and .30 in increments of .01, and the likelihood function
was very flat over this range. For both the ES and ESI models, the likelihood
function generally increases in ri and reaches a maximum at ri-.30, though the

absolute difference between the log likelihoods evaluated at n-.15 and ri—.30 is

less than .126. Since r.15 provides a reasonable pattern of debt retirements,
it is used in all of the reported estimates. Second, in the most general model
with I and a entering freely, the data were not rich enough to permit direct

and accurate estimates of these parameters. To avoid the large standard errors
that occurred in some instances, we defined aI÷a,
a,

obtained

estimates of I and

and calculated a in terms of these directly estimated parameters. Estimates

of the other model parameters remain largely unaffected under either estimation
technique.

Additional estimates of (16) are presented in the following tables.
