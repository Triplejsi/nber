Growing in Debt:

The 'Farm Crisis' and Public Policy

ABSTRACT

U.S. farms, and with them agricultural lending institutions, are currently
experiencing their most severe stress since the 1930s. As international
trade in farm products has expanded, so has the sensitivity of farm incomes
to fluctuations in domestic and world economic conditions. Thus, while price
stabilization, acreage reduction, and related policies in place since the
1930s were relatively successful in stabilizing farm income during the
1950s and 1960s, they are likely to be less effective in achieving this goal
in the future.
Our analysis of state—level panel data indicates that disruptions in
agricultural credit markets can have real effects on farm output. That finding
is consistent with the conventional wisdom that, unlike credit markets for
large firms or for firms for which monitoring is less costly, agricultural
financial markets require close customer arrangnients. Local financial
institutions, for which such relationships are best developed, are often unable
for institutional reasons to diversify their loan risks either within agriculture
or across other geographically separated activities. The deviations from perfect
markets indicate an economic rationale —— in addition to the usual political,
social, and national defense rationales —— for government intervention in
agricultural credit markets. Our empirical evidence supports the view that
maintaining customer relationships in agricultural finance is important.
Because of the Farm Credit System's ability to pool agricultural loan risks
nationally and its access to national capital markets, it will continue to
be an important lender in agricultural credit markets.

U.S farms, and with them agricultural lending institutions, are

currently experiencing their most severe stress since the 1930s. From
1980 to 1984, the average real value of U.S. farmland dropped by 29

percent. This sharp decline has been most pronounced In the corn and
wheat belts; in Nebraska, for example, the real value of farmland is

half what it was in 1980. The erosion in the value of equity has had
the effect of increasing the leverage of many farm borrowers.
Delinquent loans have increased substantially, hitting 7.5 percent of
total loans at small agricultural banks by mid—1985.

Agricultural bank earnings are down and bank failures are up: In
1983, seven of the insured commerical agricultural banks failed, while
in 1984 and 1985, this figure rose to 32 and 68 respectively.
Agricultural bank failures accounted for 41 percent of the insured
commercial banks that failed in 1984; in every quarter since,
agricultural bank failures have accounted for more than half of total

bank failures. In addition to these banks that have failed, the
fragility of agricultural banking In general has risen substantially.
For example, in 1984, over 20 percent of total agricultural loans
outstanding at banks were to borrowers with a debt—equity ratio in

excess of 70 percent and a negative cash flow. Another major farm
lender ——

the Cooperative Farm Credit System (FCS) —— has

suffered

similar portfolio deterioration and now faces an Imminent threat of
insolvency, though recent legislation provides for stop—gap assistance

from the federal government. Total outstanding farm loans likely to
default have been estimated at between $80 and $100 billion.'

—2—
This paper provides evidence supporting the argument that credit
markets are an important element in the propagation of shocks in the

farm sector.2 We emphasize potential imperfections in agricultural
credit markets based on •agency" and "information" considerations. A
central message is that localized customer borrowing relationships,
rather than the use of impersonal debt and equity markets, are important

in agricultural finance. Reliance on local relationships is further
complicated by restrictions on the ability of those intermediaries to

diversify risks. Hence deflationary shocks disturb the balance sheets
of both borrowers and lenders, and can have real effects through
fluctuations in credit availability.
When loans are made with imperfect information on the part of the
lender, the availability of credit necessary to finance operations
depends on the health of local financial intermediaries, on farmers'

cash flow, and on the collateral available to secure loans. Reduction
in available credit due to increased borrower leverage, reduced cash
flow, and increased hank vulnerability have amplified the recent
troubling developments of increased foreign agricultural output and
capacity, real exchange rate appreciation, and (except for 1983) years

of large harvests. Both anecdotal evidence and research discussed below
suggest that efficient farm producers may find themselves going
bankrupt, reducing investment and maintenance expenditures, or selling
out to farmers or land speculators with greater access to loanable
funds.

The current economic upheaval in the U.S. farm sector ——

dramatic

reductions in farm incomes and land values, increased farm
agglomeration, a wave of farm bankruptcies, and farm bank failures

—3--

unprecedented since World War II ——

raises

important questions

concerning public expenditures on domestic agriculture. While it is
widely recognized that current agricultural programs (mainly dating from
the 1930s) are poorly suited to addressing the problems of the 1980s,
there is much less consensus about which new policy directions are

likely to be the most efficient. Careful consideration of agricultural
credit markets is important when evaluating these new directions.

Plan of the Paper

The paper is organized as follows. To put the current farm
situation in perspective, we begin with a brief review of postwar U.S.

agricultural market conditions. Next we discuss the effects of credit
supply restrictions on farm production. In our empirical work, we
examine a panel data base from farm income statements and balance sheets

at the state level covering approximately the last decade. We find
economically significant effects of changes in collateral value, debt—
service burdens, and the availability of credit from commercial banks on
farm output.

The importance of local customer relationships in farm lending

suggests roles for government intervention. To provide a framework for
realistic policy analysis, we discuss salient features of the
institutions of farm finance, in particular reviewing recent

developments in commercial banks, the Farm Credit System, and the

Farmers Home Administration, three major lenders. Our empirical results
suggest that the institutional setting in agriculture credit markets is
important both for the short—run and long—run viability of efficient

—4—
farms. This importance suggests a need for a reevaluation of the
current emphasis on agricultural price and incomes programs.

A Review of U.S. Postwar Agricultural Conditions

U.S. AGRICULTURE IN PERSPECTIVE

Six facts serve to place U.S. agriculture in perspective.

1. For most of the postwar period, farming has been a declining
sector when expressed as a percentage of the gross national
product.

2. Total farm income in 1984 was $160 billion, or about 4.4
percent of GNP.

3. Productivity growth in the industry has been phenomenal; for
example, over the period from 1955 to 1984, the U.S.D.A.
measure of total output per hour of farm labor has increased
fivefold and average crop production per acre has increased by
75 percent.

4. Farm production and government assistance are unevenly divided
among farmers. In 1985, half of all farms had total sales
under $10,000 per year, produced roughly 3 percent of farm
output, and received 7

percent of federal cash payments to

farmers. The largest 112,000 (roughly the top 5 percent) had
sales in excess of $200,000, produced half of total output and

received 22 percent of federal cash payments. Farms in

between ——

with

annual sales between $10,000 and $200,000 ——

—5—
were responsible for 48 percent of total farm output and

receive 71 percent of federal cash payments. Expenditures on
price supports and acreage—reduction programs In 1986 are
projected to amount to between $26 billion and $30 billion —— a

per—farmer average of between $11,000 and $12,500.
5. As of June 30, 1985, roughly 50 percent of the loan portfolio
of the Farmers Home Administration, a malor governmental

lender, was delinquent. At both the Farm Credit System and
commercial banks, on December 31, 1984, approximately 21
percent of all outstanding debt was to farmers having both
negative cash flow and a debt—equity ratio of more than 70
percent.

4

6. The current crisis is highly crop— and region—specific. Farms
producing cash grains, general livestock, or dairy products
account for the overwhelming majority of financially stressed
farms, and these farms are concentrated in the Corn Belt and
Northern Plains states.

Postwar economic conditions of U.S. agriculture can conveniently be

divided into three distinct periods.5 The 1950s and 1960s were years of
growing real farm incomes, although this growth lagged well behind the

growth of overall U.S. economic activity. The 1970s saw a dramatic
reversal of this trend of relative decline, with rising commodity prices

and sharply expanded exports leading to increasing farm incomes. During
this decade, farmers expanded production and assumed substantial amounts

of new debt to finance this expansion. Finally, during the 1980s farm
prices declined and, faced with an appreciating dollar, exports fell

—6--

sharply. Accordingly, farm incomes, and with them farmland values,
declined at rates unprecedented En the postwar period. This sharp
decline in income, coupled with the high levels of debt acquired during
the expansion of the 1970s, has led to a sharp decline in the ability of
farmers to meet their debt obligations and to the corresponding rise In
farm bank failures.

These patterns are illustrated in Tables 1 and 2, which contain

selected series describing farm income and the balance sheet of the farm

sector. Relative to aggregate economic activity, farming has been on
the decline throughout the postwar period. This decline was slow but
continual through the 1950s and 1960s: In 1954, agricultural income was
8.3 percent of GNP; by 1970, this fraction had dropped to 5.4 percent.
Over this same period, farm income increased by only 0.6 percent

annually. With the exception of 1958, between 1954 and 1970 the rate of
return on farming activities fluctuated between 1.0 and 6.3 percent.
This prolonged period of steady decline was reversed with the
increase In farm exports and the rise in relative commodity prices

during the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1979, real U.S. agricultural exports
more than doubled and real gross farm income rose at an annual rate of

4.1 percent. The return on farm assets and the value of farm equity
rose, reflecting the Improved market conditions. Nationally, real farm
equity rose by 74 percent and real farmland values rose by 88 percent

from 1971 to 1980. These increases were most pronounced in the West and
Middle West; between 1976 and 1980 alone, land values rose by 53
percent in Indiana, 49 percent in Minnesota, and by 46 percent In

Wisconsin and Iowa.6 Backed by this increased "paper value" of
farniland, real farm debt rose by a total of 65 percent from 1971 to

1980, compared to the 21.3 percent from 1961 to 1970.

—7—
This expansion halted abruptly in the 1980s as interest rates rose,
the dollar appreciated, the Soviet grain embargo had its effect on U.S.

farmers, and commodity prices fell. From 1979 to 1983, the agricultural
sector suffered an absolute as well as a relative decline that was

largely unanticipated by agricultural borrowers and lenders. The U.S.
experienced a loss in market share in many crops during the 1980s. Farm
Income as a fraction of GNP dropped from 5.8 percent to 4.2 percent, and

aggregate real farm income fell in each year from 1980 to 1984. The
previous trend of increasing equity values also reversed as land prices

fell;7 real national farm equity in 1984 was only 72 percent of its
peak in 1980. With the fall In farm income and equity values came
increased payments on the debt accrued during the 1970s and the lowest
levels of investment In buildings and machinery since the early 1960s.

CHANGING VOLATILITY OF FARM INCOMES

The increased volatility of farm incomes during the 1970s and 1980s
Is

summarized in the first columns of Table 3. Combining the expansion

of the 1970s with the contraction of the 1980s, real farm income since

1973 grew at a slightly slower rate than it did from 1954 to 1972. In
addition, throughout the postwar period farm income has been volatile;
as a comparison, the standard deviations of the growth rate in real

national income were 2.79 percent for 1954—1972 and 3.76 percent for

1973—1984, respectively. However, the most striking feature of this row
of Table 3 is the dramatic Increase in the volatility of farm income,
with the standard deviation of annual growth rates almost tripling.

—8—
This Increased volatility of farm income since 1973 has also been
associated with an increase in the comovements of agricultural income

with U.S. aggregate economic conditions. This increased sensitivity is
reflected in the regressions reported in the remaining rows of Table 3,
in which the growth rate In farm income is regressed against the
contemporaneous and lagged values of the growth rates of various income

aggregates. Two

features

of this changing relationship between move-

ments in farm incomes and in various economic aggregates are evident

from these regressions. First, while the multiple correlation between
farm income and lags of national income was only 3 percent for the 1954—

1972 period, after 1973 this correlation rose to 55 percent. Second,
fluctuations in the various aggregates were associated with very

different changes in farm Incomes in the two periods. For example, in
the early period, the cumulative change In real farm income associated
with a one percent change in real national income was only 0.27 percent,
while in the later period this cumulative change was about 3 percent.
As has been discussed extensively elsewhere, the changing relationships elaborated above reflect an increased importance of world trade
and of the exchange rate in determining domestic commodity prices and

therefore farm incomes. Indeed, while farm exports constituted only
14.5 percent of agricultural cash receipts in 1970, by 1980 this

fraction had jumped to 29.5 percent. To the extent that the U.S.
continues to compete in international agricultural markets, this

markedly increased sensitivity of agricultural incomes to world economic
fluctuations seems likely to persist.

This increased sensitivity is important. When the prices received
by farmers were relatively stable, agricultural income risk was likely

—9—
to be uncorrelated with risk in other major sectors in the economy
(i.e., since weather would be the dominant source of fluctuations in

farm output). As shown in Table 3, however, agricultural incomes have
become more highly volatile, and fluctuations in farm incomes are
becoming more highly correlated with income fluctuations in other
sectors (because of the increased volatility of interest rates and

exchange rates). This change need not be of critical importance if
farmers are able to diversify risk by holding part of their net worth in
assets whose returns perform differently given fluctuations in interest

rates and exchange rates. However, for reasons we discuss in detail
later, farmers' wealth is held almost exclusively in farm—specific

capital (e.g., farmland). Hence, individual farmers are bearing more
significant risks of income fluctuations.8

PUBLIC POLICIES TOWARD AGRICULTURE

Public policies have evolved over the last fifty years or so
through commodity programs and credit—market programs, the second

category of which we take up later in the paper. The foundation of
federal farm commmodlty programs has been price supports and concomitant

acreage—reduction efforts. The latter were implemented through a set of
incentive programs put in place in the 1960s, by which time it had
become clear that, since the support price was effectively a floor
price, farmers who chose not to reduce their acreage reaped the benefit

of both higher production and higher prices. The support and acreage—
reduction programs were not overly costly in the 1970s, as rapid
expansion and market price increases took place.

— 10

—

By the 1980s, world farm prices declined, and more farmers chose to

participate in government commodity programs. The budgetary costs were
increased by expansion of agricultural productive capacity abroad
(particularly in grains in Argentina and the European Economic

Community). The 1981 farm bill was predicted to cost $11 billion over
the ensuing four years, but actually cost $63 billion. The Reagan
Administration's 1983 Payment—In—Kind program attempted large acreage
reductions at a huge budgetary cost of $30,000 per commercial farm in

1983. Discussions of "bailouts" have figured prominently in 1985 and
1986 legislative efforts.9

Agricultural Credit Markets and Farm Production

Is the crisis in agricultural credit markets merely a symptom of
the recent adverse shocks farmers have suffered, or do credit channels

play a role in propagating exogenous adverse shocks? Does the
availability of credit per se provide an additional influence on
agricultural income and investment?
To motivate empirical work which addresses these questions, we
begin with a simple model of links between credit markets and farm

output. Suppose that domestic farm output Q5 is determined according to
a production function defined over a set of inputs (chosen before
production takes place) subject to random disturbances (e.g., the

weather). The associated derived demands for inputs and financing
depend on expected returns on investment R (i.e., expected prices and
S 10
yields) and on the shadow price of funds I •

Individual

farmers

invest until the expected return on the margin just equals the shadow
price of funds.

— 11 —

The shadow price of funds involves much more than the loan interest
rate; even casual observation of existing loan contracts reveals the

importance of requirements for collateral, debt—service, and other "non—

price" covenants. Three aspects of credit market imperfections are of
particular relevance here——(i) the importance of collateral and
projected cash flow for obtaining loans (and the attendant problems

associated with reductions in the value of collateral), (ii) agency
problems limiting the ability of individual farmers to raise new capital
externally, and (iii) problems of credit rationing given lenders'
imperfect information about borrowers' conditions.'' We discuss these
in turn below; they certainly need not be mutually exclusive.
First, collateral requirements provide a way for lenders to

overcome their limited information about the ability of individual

farmers to pay back loans. Since the large volatility in farm cash
receipts implies nontrivial probabilities of default, lenders will
receive either the total repaid principal plus interest or, if the
farmer defaults, the value of the collateral plus any additional

recoverable cash flow. That is, lenders can be thought of as maximizing
their gross return p, which is related to the loan interest rate r
according to

(1)

p = minER + C, (1+r)L],

where L is the loan amount and C is the borrower's collateral.
Deterioration of borrowers' collateral or in the projected ability to
service existing debts out of current cash flow exacerbates the

information problems in the loan market (see discussion below). Were

— 12 —

collateral

substantial enough, It might be possible to approximate loan

contracts equivalent to those that could be written were the lenders

fully informed, since only those borrowers confident of not losing their
collateral (i.e., the less risky of the potential borrowers) would seek
loans.

Particularly important for agriculture, farmers' collateral is

composed largely of an industry—specific asset, farmland. Fluctuations
in the value of farmland are, of course, highly positively correlated

with realizations of returns on farming projects. The risk of default
is even more substantial than in the case wherein the value of

collateral is fixed and independent of project returns.'2 Hence the
ability to service debt out of projected cash flow is an important

additional consideration for the lender. Another channel through which
cash flow influences credit availability Is the surplus funds of
individual farmers who lend to neighbors and relatives since reduced

cash flow restricts the supply of private intermediation capital. These
private sources of funds accounted for 34 percent of total farm debt in
1984.

Consideration of collateral and cash flow can also be justified

institutionally by appealing to the criteria which lenders actually use

in deciding upon loans. For example, until 1971 Federal Land Banks were
effectively limited to loaning no more than 50 percent of the market

value of real estate for which the loan was taken. In 1971, this limit
was increased to 85 percent. However, since member banks recognized
that loaning up to this limit was risky, this greater discretion in
terms of debt—equity ratios led to an increased emphasis on the cash
flow of the applicant.

13

In addition, cash—flow analysis and real

— 13 —

estate

appraisal have always figured prominently in the loan supply

decisions of commercial banks and in the Farmers Home Administration's
evaluation of a potential borrower's "Farm and Home Plan."
Second, for credit restrictions to individual borrowers to have
aggregate real effects, it must be the case that individual projects are

imperfect substitutes. There are several channels through which a lack
of farm credit could have these aggregate effects. A farm that suffers
foreclosure and is not brought back into operation ——

or,

even more

dramatically, a for sale farm on which standing crops are not harvested
——

will,

of course, result in an aggregate drop in planted acreage and

production. More subtely, a lack of credit can result in decreased
productivity by forcing the sale of farm equipment, by reducing

maintenance in building and equipment, by reductions in fertilizer or
seed qualities, or by shifting to suboptimal crop or feed mixes to

reduce operating expenses. Each of these channels result In output
losses on specific farms. Since the farmland can, of course, only be
farmed at any one time by a single operator, credit restrictions can in
theory result in aggregate reductions in output.
Because of the complexity of modern farming operations, these and
similar subtle changes in production can be difficult to monitor by

outside parties. This difficulty of monitoring can result in losses of
efficiency arising from dissociating farm ownership from farm management
or, more generally, from "agency" problems.'4 Attempts to raise

collateral levels by mergers of existing farm operations by owner—
operators would not be useful so long as debt—equity ratios are similar

across farmers. One possible alternative solution is, of course, to
take on new equity from nonfarmers. Potential agency costs are the

— 14 —

likely

explanation of why this option has historically been seldom

15

used.

Third, theoretical research involving models of loan markets in

which information (between borrowers and lenders) is imperfect has shown
that the loan interest rate and the shadow price of credit are not

equivalent. Agricultural projects correspond to such "information—
intensive" investments to the extent that monitoring of projects (and

associated treatment of the land) and returns is difficult. In these
information—intensive credit markets, credit rationing to some borrowers
is likely.'6

In the simplest possible model, no information problems exist, and
the competitive equilibrium involves the agricultural credit markets

clearing through adjustments in the rate of intere3t. However, when
agricultural borrowers have private information about their project
returns, lenders cannot distinguish the riskiness of individual

projects, so that adverse selection will lead to credit rationing in a
credit—market equilibrium in which loan contracts specify only the

interest rate.'7 Again, with a nonzero probability of default, lenders
consider the potential for loan repayment as well as the interest rate

to be charged when assessing the profitability of a loan. Past some
critical level of the interest rate, high—quality borrowers will either

seek loanable funds elsewhere or will leave the market for credit. As a
result, banks will find themselves with a preponderance of borrowers who
have a high probability of default.

A corollary to agency arguments is that changes in the ability of
lenders specializing in monitoring information—intensive projects——here

commercial banks——to supply credit can have real effects. The present

— 15 —

situation

in agricultural banking is serious. There were more failures

in 1985 than in any year since the 1930s; approximately two—thirds of

these were in rural areas. In addition, rural and agricultural banks
have constituted an increasing fraction of failed banks; 70 percent of
bank failures in 1985 were in rural banks, up from 34 percent in 1983,

and more than 55 percent (a total of 68) were in agricultural banks, up

from 16 percent in 1983. Conditions in heavily agricultural areas were
more stark. Fully three—fourths of agricultural banks failures occurred
in the Corn Belt and Plains states; no agricultural banks failed in the
Northeast •

18

A number of potential concerns arise here (we discuss these in more

detail later). First, limitations on branch banking impede loan
diversification, making farm banks particularly vulnerable to changes in

local conditions. Second, a recent evaluation of farm bank failures by
Gregory Gajewski19 notes that banks taking over failed banks tend to be
more conservative than average, making a smaller proportion of funds

available for loans. Furthermore, the F.D.I.C. has had difficulty
finding suitable banks willing to take over failed rural banks. While
the F.D.I.C. was unable to obtain an acceptable bid to take over failed
banks (and therefore used the "payoff" method of liquidation) in only 33
out of 239 bank failures over the period from 1983 to 1985, fully 24

such closings occurred in rural banks. These rural payoff closings were
concentrated in such agricultural states as Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma,

and Texas. From the perspective of credit supply constraints these
failures are particularly worrisome since local commercial banks have
specialized in making and monitoring information—intensive loans

(exploiting their customer relationships); the recent increase in bank
failures is likely to disrupt the availability of credit to farmers.

— 16 —

Based on these credit—market imperfections, we emphasize four
potentially important components of the shadow price of credit to
agricultural borrowers ——

the

interest rate charged (r), the value of

farm real estate (RE) as collateral, the projected debt—service burden
(DS) measured as the ratio of interest payments relative to cash
receipts, and disruptions En the availability of information—intensive

credit measured by bank failures (FAILS). That is, the shadow price of
funds En period t—1 is

i1 =

f(rj,

REi, t_iDSt, FAILS_i),

Empirical Evidence on Credit Supply Restrictions in U.S. Agriculture

TEST OF CREDIT EFFECTS ON FARM OUTPUT

Macroeconomic time—series data are not likely to be particularly
useful for testing the impact of proxies for credit supply restrictions

— 17 —

on farm output and income, because they cannot permit consideration of
the large variation across farmers in terms of crop mix (and hence
expected prices to be received), debt—service capability, collateral,

and situations in local credit markets. An alternative would be to
examine microeconomic data on individual borrower—lender relationships

over time. While data on Individual borrowers would permit estimation
of microeconomic features of credit supply restrictions, such data would
not, however, permit measuring directly the net aggregate effect of

credit rationing, on aggregate agricultural supply. As an intermediate
step, we constructed a panel data base on farm income statements and
balance sheets and commercial bank performance at the state level
covering 24 states (including all of the principal agricultural
states)22 from 1977 to 1984.

Observations in this panel data set consist of state—level totals

or averages for a given year. For example, the real estate variable Is
the value of farmland in the state as of January 1 of the year In

question. Given these data, we estimate equations of the form

(4)

=

f(_iRj

r1_1, REIt1, t_1 DSit, FAILSIt_i

where I and t denote the state and year, respectively, and X and Z

denote a set of fixed state and time effects. The dependent variable
used in the econometric work Is a quantity Index, constructed as the
(logarithm of the) quotient of state cash receipts from marketings and a
state—specific commodity price index.
No expected price term per se appears in our estimation of (4).

Variables describing the demand for agricultural output will in general

— 18

—

appear in any reduced—form equation. Rather than attempting to model
annual aggregate demand shifts, we have included dummy variables for

each year in our regression equations. Expected price changes are
captured by the year dummies, which reflect changes in aggregate
economic activity and the exchange rate, and by the state fixed effects,
which capture state—level variation in the crop mix.
As we do not have data on farm interest rates state by state, no
loan interest rate is included directly (because of the inclusion of the

fixed time effects). Collateral is measured by the log of (constant—
dollar) real estate values, and debt—service burdens are proxied by the
ratio of interest payments to total cash flow (including government

payments and nonfarm income). The bank failures measure is the total
number of bank failures in that state in that year. As another proxy
for supply restrictions we include net loan chargeoffs as a percentage
of total loans at agricultural banks in that state in that year.
In addition to the specification in (4), we also considered various
interactions with the debt—service variable to test whether (I) effects
of debt service on credit availability vary according to initial

leverage (as measured by the debt—equity ratio DIE), and whether (ii) given
levels of debt—service burdens are more severe for farms of moderate

size (FS) than for large farms. For this second interaction, we define
FS as the fraction of output produced in each state by farms of moderate
size (specifically, with total sales of between $40,000 and $100,000

dollars In 1982). The farm—size variable is a proxy for the
distribution of debt burden within a particular state. Given that large
farms tend to have higher than average debt—equity ratios (see the

discussion below), a high proportion of moderate—sized farms in a given

— 19

state

indicates a more even distribution of debt across farmers, and

hence less vulnerability in the aggregate to shocks which increase the
debt—equity ratio.
Our estimation strategy is designed to avoid two potential pitfalls

that would arise were one to use ordinary least squares in an attempt to
identify the credit supply effects embodied in the theoretical

relationship (3). First, persistent differences in crop and livestock
mixes (and thus in credit requirements as inputs to production
functions) across states could lead to spurious significance of the
credit variables; we avoid this potential problem by estimating the

regressions using fixed state effects. Second, because of the obvious
potential simultaneity of credit demand and the supply of output, we

estimate our output equations using two—stage least squares. We used as
instruments lagged endogenous variables and their interactions with
survey responses of agricultural bankers indicating whether their
expectations were for increased or decreased loan demand in the next

quarter.23 The latter is designed to capture pure demand effects.
Though not reported here, our results are robust to the use instead of
lagged values of the independent variables.
Our two—stage least squares estimation results using fixed state

and time effects appear in Table 4. The estimated regression
coefficients and their t—statistics are reported in the first six

columns. The seventh and eighth columns contain the F—statistics (and
their p—values) for tests that the credit supply variables equal zero,

and the final three columns contain measures of the serial correlation

present in the residuals. The Box—Pierce Q statistics and the estimated
serial correlation coefficients indicate slight but statistically

— 20 —

significant

serial correlation in the residuals, which is unsurprising

since we omitted some variables (e.g., factor prices) either because
they were unavailable or because they were not germane to this investi-

gation. The reported standard errors have been adjusted to correct for
this serial correlation.24

Several patterns in these results are of particular interest. The
impact on output of changes in collateral values or in the local

provision of information—intensive credit (as measured by real estate
values and commercial bank failures, respectively) have the expected

sign and are precisely estimated. Increases in debt—service burdens
(interest payments relative to cash receipts) are associated with

reductions in output, though the coefficient is in some cases

imprecisely measured. As one would expect, given levels of debt—service
burdens have a more substantial effect when debt—equity ratios are high
(although this effect is not statistically significant).25
Local bank failures reduce output (through restricting the

available supply of credit); we discuss this point in more detail later
In the context of regulatory restrictions on commercial bank lending.

Estimated coefficients on the loan—chargeoffs measure are never
statistically significantly different from zero, though their inclusion

sharpens the precision of the estimates of the effects of the debt—

service variable. While the coefficient on the bank failures variable
may seem large at first glance, it is important to note that it Is a
discrete proxy for many continuous and persistent changes (for example
in the quality of bank loan portfolios).

Debt—service burdens have a less severe impact for medium—sized

farms than for other farms. If credit constraints are less relevant for

— 21 —

borrowers with "deep pockets" and if the large farms in our sample
became large because of higher—than—average leveraging, then, for a
given statewide average debt—service ratio, the more moderate—sized

farms will have less binding credit constraints. This interpretation of
the coefficient on DS*FS is consistent with the high debt—equity ratios
of large and moderate sized farms in the boom years of the 1970s presented En Table 5.

ISSUES OF INTERPRETATION

There are, of course, issues of interpretation of any empirical

results attempting to separate credit supply and demand effects. For
example, in addition to serving as collateral, land values will tend to
reflect market expectations of future farm cash flows, thus agri-

cultural prices.26 If, however, agricultural prices for particular
commodities are common across states, if expectations of prices are
similar across states, and if each state's crop mix is relatively stable
over time, than, as argued above, fixed state and time effects will
capture both expected prices and realized agricultural demand.

A possible confusion between supply and demand effects arises in
the debt—service measure, where high values of debt service may indicate

sanguine expectations. Here, the demand—side effect leads one to expect
a positive coefficient, which is opposite to the negative coefficient
implied by the credit—supply effect and the negative coefficients
estimated by two—stage least squares reported in Table 4.
Finally, there is independent evidence of credit supply

restrictions on the part of commercial banks. Results from quarterly

— 22 —

surveys of credit conditions at commercial banks by the regional Federal
Reserve Banks (Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, Minneapolis, and
Richmond)27 indicate a marked decline in 1982 in the number of banks
reporting a "higher" availability of funds for new farm loans and a
substantial increase in the percentage of banks reporting that higher
collateral would be required relative to loan size.
Another possible explanation for our empirical results not
involving credit rationing is that farm output declines result in bank

failures, and that farm output is serially correlated. According to
this interpretation, the bank—failures variable might spuriously he

capturing this dependence in farm output. To check for this
possibility, we examined the time series relationship between the credit

variables and the output variable. In both a bivariate model of bank
failures and log output and a trivariate model of bank failures, the
logarithm of loan chargeoffs, and the logarithm of output, the output
variable failed to Grariger—cause the banking variables at a 15 percent

level. (Both models included state and time fixed effects.) In
contrast, as expected, real farm income does Granger—cause bank failures
at the 5 percent level in both the bivarlate and trivarlate models,

although the link from farm Income to loan chargeoffs is, somewhat

surprisingly, weaker. Taken together, these results suggest that this
alternative explanation will not explain the results in Table 4, despite
the link between current farm income and the future viability of
agricultural banks.

— 23 —

Financial

Variables and the Trend Toward Larger Farms

An important characteristic of U.S. agriculture in the postwar

period has been a trend toward larger and more productive farms. Farm
size statistics are reported in intervals of nominal dollars (e.g. the

number of farms with sales between $20,000 and $39,999). We have
deflated these nominal dollar values using the farm price index to
compute selected farm size statistics in 1984 dollars.

28

These

statistics are reported in Table 6. By 1984 real sales of farms had
risen to a level almost three times that of 1960, with the fastest rate
of growth occurring in the 1960s.
The literature on farm production suggests two reasons for

increasing farm sizes. The most important is surely the tremendous
increase En productivity in agriculture (in terms of output per acre)

over the period. Technological advances tend to increase the minimum
scale for efficient farming operations, although this minimum efficient

scale necessarily varies across crop mixes. A detailed review of the
evidence concerning the minimum efficient scale for farming operations

is given by Bruce Hall and Phillip Le Veeen.29 Most of the studies they
review suggest that the long run average—cost curve is "L—shaped," so
that most of the benefits of technology are achieved by modestly sized

farms of from 100—320 acres (depending on the crop). These studies
suggest that the technological advantages of very large farms are

relatively small in relation to farms of moderate size. This evidence
is echoed for cash grain farms in Illinois by Philip Garcia, Steven

Sonka, and Man y.30 In addition to these considerations related to
the physical production process, several authors have argued that the

— 24 —

realization

of managerial economies and economies of scope require

moderate farm size.3'

The second explanation for increased economic viability of larger
farms is that farmers have differential access to credit, depending on

cash—flow histories and collateral. This would lead growth to occur
with a disproportionate expansion of the farms of the "credit—worthy."
Though Hall and Le Veeen note the possibility that financial factors

could lead to an increase in farm size, they do not present any

empirical evidence on this point. Indirect evidence of the importance
of access of credit for farm investment comes from the work of Linda Lee

and William Stewart. Credit constraints may lead farmers to reduce
long—run investments that would otherwise maintain the quantity or

quality of the topsoil and land.32 Lee and Stewart present empirical
evidence in support of an effect of farm income on soil conservation;
they conclude that large farms or farms with significant uncommitted

cash flows were more active in soil—conservation practices.33 One would
expect credit supply effects to be especially pronounced for investments
which require a relatively long time horizon ——
——

since

like

soil conservation

short—run credit supply restrictions increase the effective

discount rates of constrained borrowers.

Modeling links between such credit variables as collateral, debt—
service ratios, or debt—equity ratios and farm agglomeration is
problematic because of the multiplicity of potential relationships.

First, a farmer who expects increased product demand (or Increased

productivity) will be tempted to expand his operation. While a farmer's
prediction of more severe debt—service burdens In the future may enter
negatively into his decision to enter into new loan contracts, the

— 25 —

observed debt service and debt—equity ratios in the next period will
reflect these new loans. Thus increased DS and DIE would be associated
with increased expansion of output and of farm sizes, an explanation
consistent with the expansion of output and debt in the 1970s.
A second reason that increased debt service and debt—equity ratios
might lead to increased farm size is that, as these variables increase,

more farmers are exposed to the risk of failure. Depending upon the
size of the failed farms and their disposition (i.e., whether they are
subdivided and sold as smaller farms or are sold to already large and
expanding enterprises), the effect of farm failures could either be to
increase or to decrease average farm size.
While increasing average farm size may reflect the increasing

productivity of all existing farmers, a widening of differences in farm
size among farmers indicates differences in the ability or desire to
grow, providing evidence consistent with the importance of credit

availability. Table 6 shows that aggregate farm size growth occurred
primarily through an expansion of the very largest farms. The fraction
of income of farms of moderate size (with real sales between $50,000 and

$150,000) fell from 1960 to 1984. Over this period, while mean farm
sales and the sales of the ninetieth percentile tripled, median farm

sales grew by only 23 percent. Thus the increase in the average scale
of production has not been accomplished through proportional increases
in all farms' output; rather, the variance of farm size has increased
dramatically along with the mean.

Public

Policy and

the

Farm Crisis

MAKING POLICY IN THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL SETTING

Existing forms of credit intermediation offer special challenges

and opportunities for interventions designed to alleviate stress in

credit markets. Such institution—specific recommendations require a
brief survey of the existing terrain. The principal institutional
lenders have been commercial banks, the Farm Credit System, the Farmers

Home Administration, and life insurance companies; the relative

importance of each is documented In Table 7. We review the current
status and special attribute of the first three below.34

Commercial Banks

Commercial agricultural banks —— those with greater than the

national average of 16 percent of their loan portfolio in agriculture ——

suffer

as agricultural borrowers find it increasingly difficult to meet

their obligations.35 Furthermore, recent trends, along with the high
leverage and low cash flow of many agricultural borrowers indicate that

private bank failures and concomitant agricultural bank credit scarcity
are unlikely to abate over the next few years.36

The concentration of bank vulnerability is important because
banking in farm states is restricted by prohibitions on Interstate entry

and, typically, by unit—banking laws. Branch—banking restrictions
operate to increase banks' vulnerability to failure —— by restricting
bank size and the ability to diversify loan risks —— and to accentuate

— 27 —

the

consequences of bank failures by limiting the entry of alternative

intermediaries. The scope for improvement through branching and
diversification i.s demonstrated by the robust performance of California

banks. California leads the country in total agricultural production
and has had a higher than average percentage of troubled agricultural

loans. The percentage of agricultural loans with non—accrual status in
1984 was 8.4 for California and 4.7 for the rest of the country. The
agricultural loan delinquency rate for 1984 was 13.1 percent in

California, compared to the national average of 8.9 percent. Net
chargeoffs as a percentage of agricultural loans was 6.1 percent in

California and 1.8 percent in other states.37 At the same time,
California accounted for only one of the 68 agricultural bank failures

in 1985. This is because large banks, which account for most of
agricultural lending in California, held only 3 percent of their
portfolio in agricultural production loans.

38

Further evidence for the scope for improvement through branch

banking comes from the distribution of troubled banks. In 1985, 36.4
percent of U.S. agricultural banks had a proportion of non—performing
loans of less than 2 percent, while the national average was 4.5 percent
and only 30.5 percent of agricultural banks had ratios in excess of 5

percent. Similarly, 39 percent of agricultural banks show a rate of
return to equity of less than 5 percent, while 50 percent show a greater

than 10 percent rate of return.39 Presumably, branch banking would lead
to a more even distribution of losses on agricultural loans among banks,

and prevent as many banks from crossing the failure threshold. In
addition, it would allow banks with a lower proportion of loan losses to
enter markets occupied by troubled banks.

— 28 —

The Farm Credit System

The Cooperative Farm Credit System (FCS) is a nationwide network of

financial institutions owned by borrower stockholders. It is divided
into twelve districts and is comprised of twelve Federal Land Banks,
twelve Federal Intermediate Credit Associations, and thirteen Banks for

Cooperatives (including a central Bank for Cooperatives). The Federal
Land Banks finance mortgages through more than 400 Federal Land Bank
Associations; the Federal Intermediate Credit Associations finance
production loans through nearly as many Production Credit Associations.
Until recently the FCS has functioned as a loose confederation of

decentralized organizations with most discretionary authority in the
hands of district—level management, though funds have been raised by the

national—level Farm Credit Funding Corporation. One of the main results
of the current financial stress has been a change toward greater

centralization in lending policy. To this end, national organizations
have been created or redesigned under the Farm Credit Amendments Act of

1985. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) regulates the districts more
closely and from a separate arm's—length position; the new Farm Credit

Capital Corporation has authority to allocate funds among districts in
order to shore up the relatively weak units with the surplus of the
relatively strong units; the new Farm Credit Corporation of America
(FCCA) acts as a research and advisory arm of the FCS.40
The troubled condition of the FCS largely parallels that of

commercial banks; commercial banks have roughly the same proportion of

debtors in each cash—flow/debt—equity class.4' Like commercial banks,
FCS intermediaries have experienced a growing rate of loan delinquency

— 29 —

and threats of default. Portfolio quality varies greatly among FCS
districts.42 Though districts varied up through June 1983 with respect
to the ratio of "untroubled" to total loan items at Federal Land Banks,

all districts reported in excess of 92 percent. By December 1985, six
districts had fallen below 85 percent. Much of this variation in Land
Bank performance reflects relative degrees of diversification in
regional economics.43
For our purposes, it is important to consider the ability of the
FCS to function as an effective localized provider of agricultural
credit, particularly when local banks may be vulnerable to fluctuations
in farm income because of institutional restrictions on their ability to

diversify risks. The FCS enjoys advantages over commercial banks both
through an implicit government commitment to its debtholders and through
a cooperative national network for spreading risk and merging

troubled associations. At the same time, three specific features of FCS
organization and rules ——

the method of arriving at interest rates on

loans, cooperative stock ownership by borrowers, and the potential
incompatibility of local and national goals ——

create

problems of

coordination and portfolio management.
Loan interest rate policy and cooperative ownership together have
encouraged relatively good borrowers to leave the FCS recently.
Interest rates are set on an average—cost rather than a marginal—cost

basis. Loan interest rates reflect the average interest cost on
outstanding FCS bonds, operating expenses and past loan losses. When
bond interest rates fall and losses from the past rise —— as they did in
the last two years —— average cost exceeds marginal cost. By pricing at

average cost, therefore, the FCS encourages borrowers who can retire

— 30 —

debt or refinance it at competing institutions to do so, while at the
same time it places unwarranted stress on borrowers who remain in the
system.44

The cooperative nature of the FCS creates a further incentive for

borrowers who can withdraw to choose to do so. Upon taking out an FCS
loan, borrowers must purchase between 5 and 10 percent of the funds

borrowed in FCS stock. When the loan is repaid, these funds ——

or

a

lesser amount if loan losses have reduced shareholders' equity to below
par value —— are reimbursed to borrowers; it is not possible to enjoy a

capital gain on FCS stock. The threat of future equity losses leads
borrowers in vulnerable districts to repay their loans prematurely in
order to withdraw capital before expected portfolio losses are realized;
it also encourages borrowers in relatively financially healthy districts
to repay their loans before the impending consolidation of FCS stock

eliminates the distinctions among districts' equity positions. The
combined effect of high interest rates and expected capital losses ——

due to average cost pricing and cooperative ownership —— on early "pay—
downs" has been large.45 Presumably, the borrowers leaving the FCS are
among those of the highest quality. Thus average—cost pricing and
cooperative ownership act to weaken further the FCS portfolio during the
current crisis.

Finally, the potential incompatibility between national — and
district—level objectives has created problems of coordination both in
the past and during the current period of transition toward

centralization. Policies which are advantageous from a national
perspective ——

loan

interest rate differentials across borrowers of

different riskiness, for example —— may he resisted In troubled

— 31 —

districts

which see a benefit to keeping rates their borrowers pay lower

than true marginal cost, and which do not have as strong an incentive to
protect the system's capital since they will be net recipients of a

capital transfer in any case. At the same time, districts with
relatively healthy balance sheets may be encouraged to lend more freely
today, before the new Capital Corporation has a chance to implement its
program of inter—district capital transfers.

Farmers Home Administration

The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) Is the "lender of last

resort" for farmers. The FmHA provides direct loans of various types——
including Farm Ownership Loans (FO), Farm Operating Loans (OL), Economic
Emergency Loans (EE), and Economic Disaster Loans (ED)——as well as loan

guarantees on loans made by other lending institutions. Applicants for
credit must own or operate a "family—sized" farm, not so big that it

requires a large proportion of hired labor, nor so small as to be

considered a "rural residence." Further requirements are that the
applicant (f) has been refused credit from another lending institution;
(ii) has sufficient experience as a farmer; (lii) be "creditworthy"

(recent bankruptcy, delinquency, or a history of slow payments would be
evidence of a lack thereof); and (iv) demonstrate a need to rely on farm
income 46

Credit supply restrictions to troubled borrowers in local loan

markets need not be binding if government credit sources are

sufficiently generous. Funding limits for the various FmHA programs are
set by Congress, though these limits have only recently acted as binding

— 32 —

constraints

on FmHA lending. Typically, in the past, when funding

limits for qualified borrowers were reached in a particular program,

Congress increased funding or the Secretary of Agriculture transferred

funds from one program to another. Since some loan programs had
unlimited "entitlement" status (e.g., the Emergency Disaster Program,
ED) the power to transfer funds from one to another effectively gave the

Secretary of Agriculture an unlimited amount of lending authority. For
example, in fiscal year 1985, the Secretary transferred $1.7 billion
from the ED program to the direct OL program and $460 million from the
ED program to the guaranteed OL program.

Two recent developments have made current congressional lending
limits a binding constraint on FmHA activity. First, the volume of FrnBA
loan requests has risen markedly since 1984, as borrowers who previously

depended on the FCS and commercial banks find themselves unable to
secure credit without FmHA assistance——either in the form of a direct
loan or a loan guarantee; total loans increased nearly 10 percent during

fiscal 1985 to a level of over $29 billion. Second, the entitlement—
loan—program loophole has been eliminated by the Food Security Act of
1985, which placed a ceiling of $1.3 billion on the ED program.

The portfolio of the FmHA has suffered in recent years more than

any other lending institution. By June 30, 1985, roughly 50 percent of
FmFTA loan principal was in delinquent loans, of which a majority have

been delinquent for more than three years. As of December 1984, 40
percent of the FmHA borrowers had debt—equity ratios of greater than 70
percent and negative cash flow——twice the figure for commercial banks

and the FCS.47 Presumably, this reflects the poorer initial quality of
FmHA borrowers. An additional explanation for so high a proportion of

— 33 —

loan delinquencies is the court—enforced moratorium on many FmHA
foreclosures from 1983 through 1985. The FmHA was forced to adopt
uniform, detailed standards for Informing borrowers of their rights and
options, which include applying for rescheduling, or a five—year payment
deferral.

Loan standards are tightening at the FmHA. The FmHA will only
allow rescheduling or deferral in cases where the farmer can demonstrate

long—run viability. By the end of fiscal 1985, the FmHA had received
108,710 applications for assistance by borrowers; 29,196 of these were

granted a rescheduling, 15,794

were granted a debt set—aside, and 21,539

were rejected for reasons of inadequate cash flow.48 Jerry Hansen of the
Center for Rural Affairs estimates that of the more than half of the

65,000 adverse action notices sent out by the FmHA so far this year will
end in foreclosure.
Several factors point to a growing tightening of FIUHA credit

availability in the future as well. As discussed above, congressional
limits will become a binding constraint on total lending for the first

time. Moreover, in November 1985, the FmHA adopted tighter eligibility
requirements for operating loans: Previously less attention was placed
on the applicant's ability to service other loans; after November 1985,
a farmer who cannot pay off other debts in addition to the operating

loan were not to be granted credit. This change, combined with the
simultaneous increase in foreclosures will force many farmers who
previously had qualified for FmHA forebearance to leave farming.

— 34

Conclusions

The findings presented here suggest two Implications concerning

agricultural policy. First, as international trade In farm products has
expanded, so has the sensitivity of farm incomes to fluctuations in

domestic and world economic conditions. Thus, while the price
stabilization, acreage reduction, and related policies in place since

the 1930s were relatively successful in stabilizing farm income during
the 1950s and 1960s, these programs will most likely be less effective
in achieving this goal In the future.
Second, our analysis of the state panel data indicates that

disruptions in agricultural credit markets can have real effects on farm

output. This finding is consistent with the conventional wisdom that,
unlike credit markets for large firms or for firms for which monitoring
is less costly, agricultural financial markets require close customer

arrangements. Local financial institutions, for which such
relationships are best developed, are often unable (for institutional
reasons) to diversify their loan risks (within agriculture and across

other geographically separated activities). The deviations from perfect
markets indicate an economic rationale ——

in

addition to the usual

political, social, and national defense rationales ——

for

government

intervention in agricultural markets. Our empirical evidence supports
the view that customer relationships in localized credit markets are

important In agriculture. Because of its ability to pool agricultural
loan risks nationally and its access to national capital markets, the
Farm Credit System will continue to be an important lender in
agricultural credit markets.

2. This view of supply—side failures in credit markets as being an
important determinant of economic activity has received increasing
attention (see for example Ben Bernanke, Alan Blinder, and Benjamin
Friedman). However, empirical attempts to ascertain the role of
credit constraints in determining economic activity have been
confined to historical data pertaining to the National Banking Era
(in Charles Calomiris and Glenn Hubbard) or to the Great Depression
(in Ben Bernanke). While these historical analyses are suggestive,
more relevant to the issues raised in current deregulatory and farm
policy debates would be an investigation of the quantitative
importance of credit—supply effects on output that might have arisen
over the past several years in the farm sector. Ben S. Bernanke,

in particular notes a pattern similar to that experienced in recent

I, accompanied by a large increase in mortgage debt to finance
expansion. Land values fell subsequently in the mid—1920s and 1930s
as expectations changed. The combination of high levels of debt
service and restrictions of credit to agricultural borrowers led to
the highest levels of foreclosure rates ever experienced in U.S.
agriculture. Indeed, James Stock argues that high leveraging, heavy
debt—service burdens, and the associated risk of foreclosure were
central to the agrarian unrest movements before World War I. Lee J.

7. In addition to reflecting the decline in the relative price of
agricultural commodities, the decline in farm land values in the
1980s may well have been exacerbated by the general reduction in
inflation. For example, Martin Feldstein has shown that the
relative price of land (and of other nondepreciating real stores of
value) will increase with inflation in the presence of unindexed
taxes on capital income. Martin Feldstein, "Inflation, Tax Rules,
and the Prices of Land and Gold," Journal of Public Economics, vol.

8. The analysis follows the general discussion of the allocation of
risk, by William Brainard and F. T. Dolbear. We emphasize that
farmers rely heavily on localized loan markets, often with limited
potential for diversification (e.g., because of branching
restrictions on commercial banks). William C. Brainard and F. T.

we discuss potential agency problems with equity finance; see also

Efficiency, Collateral, and Business Fluctuations" (Mimeograph,

Stiglitz, "Information, Finance Constraints, and Business
Fluctuations" (Mimeograph, Princeton University, 1986).
11. These credit—market imperfections are likely to apply to many types
of small businesses. There are reasons, however, to believe that
they may be relatively more severe for farmers. First, farmers are
subject to much greater income volatility than the typical
proprietor. Second, the production process in agriculture is very
capital (land)—intenslve, and a large minimum investment is required
—— much larger than for a typical small business with similar
sales. Third, the nature of the production process works against
farmers with respect to cash flow: (1) there is a long period
between the purchase of inputs and the sale of output; and
(ii) short—run variable costs are a small portion of total costs.

— 37 —

12. This argument relates well to discussions of "debt—deflation"
episodes, in which wealth is redistributed from entrepreneurs to
savers, with associated declines in the ability to obtain loans to
finance productive investments. See the initial propostion In
Irving Fisher; examples of subsequent empirical analysis include
Bernanke and Calomiris and Hubbard. Irving Fisher, "The Debt—

15. A general discussion of constraints on equity financing is given by
Bruce Greenwald, Joseph E. StIglitz, and Andrew Weiss and by
Nicholas Majiuf and Stewart Myers. Tenure arrangements separating
land ownership from farm operations can also discourage soil
conservation (reducing future output) through short—term leases or
inequitable sharing of the costs and benefits of conservation
investments. See the discussion in S.V. Ciriacy—Wantrup and In
Linda Lee and William Stewart. Bruce C. Greenwald, Joseph E.
Stiglitz, and Andrew Weiss, "Informational Imperfections in the

17. An Important contribution of Stlglitz and Weiss Is that imperfect
information can limit the number of loans a "bank" will make; that
Is, "credit rationing" occurs In the sense that, within a class of
observatlonally equivalent borrowers, not all receive loans.

Review (March 1986), pp. 3—9.
20. There is evidence In the literature for credit effects on such long—
term investments as soil conservation. We discuss this point later.
21. The ability of fluctuations in credit availability to affect
producers' incomes depends, of course, on the sensitivity of total
demand (including net foreign demand) to changes in price.
Appreciation of the dollar and expansion of agricultural capacity
abroad have made the total demand for U.S. farm goods substantially
price—elastic. Reductions In farm output because of credit
restrictions are thus likely to result in lower farm incomes.

22. The data used are not available prior to 1977. Our sample includes
all states that were either among the top 20 states in total farm
cash receipts in 1982, or among the top 10 states in wheat cash
receipts in 1982, or both, with the exception of Florida, whose crop
share changed sufficiently over the sample period to make the
assumption of our fixed effects model questionable. To this group
we added South Dakota, leaving the following 24 states in our
sample: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Because
data on loan chargeoffs were not available for North Carolina and
Washington, the regressions involving this variable used only 22
states.
23. We use an annual average of a quarterly time series of survey
responses of agricultural bankers to indicate whether their
expectations were for increased or decreased loan demand In the next
quarter. The expectations data were taken from the Agricultural
Credit Conditions Survey of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
24. The correction entailed estimating the mean temporal error
covariance matrix for each state, and then using this estimate to
compute the adjusted coefficient covariance matrix.

— 39

25. Our results with respect to credit variables are robust to using
constant—dollar cash receipts as the dependent variable and to
including the (state—specific) relative prices of farm products as
an additional regressor, although this price variable formally
should not enter the reduced—form specification.
26. This long—run perspective must be qualified, of course, to the
extent that liquidity constraints raise the discount rate for
calculating the present value of land.
27. These data are summarized in Emanual Melichar, Agricultural Finance
Databook (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July
1985).

28. Distributions for aggregate U.S. farm sales and Income were
constructed from data on the number of farms with sales or income in
various nominal ranges, which were deflated by the farm price index
and then used to estimate lognormal distributions. Sales and income
data are from Economic Indicators of the Farm Sector, National
Financial Summary (U.S.D.A., 1984), Tables 27 and 30. The farm
price index is from the Economic Report of the President (Council
of Economic Advisers, 1986).

can be found in David Pimentel, et al. "Land Degradation: Effects
on Food and Energy Resources," Science, vol. 194 (October 8, 1976),
pp. 149—55. In the 1930s, poor soil conservation practices were
thought by life insurance company lending agents to accompany credit
constraints for farmers; see the discussion in Archibald H.
Woodruff, Jr., Farm Mortgage Loans of Life Insurance Companies (New
Haven, Yale University Press, 1937).

tion," American Journal of Agricultural Economics, vol. 62

34. Participation by life insurance companies in agricultural credit
markets (primarily in real estate mortgages) has declined both

— 40

absolutely and relatively since the mid—1960s, in part because of
the increased involvement of the Farm Credit System in farm
lending. This decline has intensified in recent years, as might be
expected from an analysis of lenders' relative efficiency in
monitoring information—intensive loans in bad times. Life insurance
companies also sharply curtailed their lending in the 1930s in
response to both the deflation in farm prices and the centralization
of loan administration; see the discussion in Woodruff. Woodruff,
Farm Mortgage Loans.
35. Sixty—eight agricultural banks failed in 1985, most of them small
relative to surviving agricultural banks and non—agricultural
banks. Failed agricultural banks had average total assets of $21
million, which is two—thirds the average for agricultural bank
assets and one—eighth the average size for all commercial banks.
Vulnerable agricultural banks —— those with past—due and non—
performing loans greater than total capital —— rose from 240 at the
end of 1984 to 332 at the end of 1985. Net chargeoffs as a
percentage of total loans at agricultural banks increased from an
average of 0.21 in the 1970s to 0.32 in 1980, 0.69 in 1982, 1.22 in
1984, and 2.12 in 1985. The rate of return on equity for
agricultural banks as a group declined from an average of 14 percent
in the 1970s to 11 percent in 1983, 9 percent in 1984, and 6 percent
in 1985. See Emanuel Melichar, "Agricultural Banking Experience,
1985" (Mimeograph, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
March 8, 1986).

36. See Melichar, "Agricultural Banks," pp. 437—8. Melichar estimates
that two—fifths of farms' bank debt Is in danger of default.

40. The movement toward centralization corresponds to a commitment from
Congress to allow the use of public funds to support the FCS, under
a complex formula involving the participation of the FCA, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and Congress. Thus at the same time
Congress has acted to reassure FCS bondholders (and perhaps
stockholders) of a government commitment to back FCS bonds, it has
created legislation to coordinate internal self—help and to
centralize decisiorimaking in a way which makes the system more
accountable to Congress. The effect of congressional action on
bondholder confidence is illustrated by the changes in the yield
spread between six—month Treasury and FCS securities. The spread
rises from roughly zero from January through June of 1985 to around
twenty basis points In July and August, then rises to a peak of
around eighty basis points for September through November, and falls
sharply in December, with the passage of the Farm Credit Amendments
Act of 1985. Since then the spread has fallen and maintained itself
at a level of approximately twenty basis points (through July 1986).

— 41

41. See Agricultural and Credit Outlook, 1986 (Farm Credit
Administration, 1986).
42. For example, the Springfield, Baltimore, and Texas districts show
very low percentages of non—accrual loans (under 2 percent), while
the Louisville, St. Louis, St. Paul, Omaha, Wichita, and Spokane
districts all have non—accrual loans in excess of 10 percent. Non—
accrual loans either: (1) are over 90 days contractuallly past due
and inadequately secured, or (ii) have been classified as a "loss"
or uncollectible with respect to all principal and interest due.
The districts show greater similarity with respect to the percentage
-of their overall portfolios deemed of "acceptable" quality——that Is,
loans not classified as "loss," "problem," or "vulnerable." Because
the percentage of loans not deemed acceptable is a reasonable
predictor of future non—accrual loans, one would expect the
currently most troubled districts to continue to experience high
relative stress, with the addition of the Sacramento district to the
list of relatively high future losses.
43. The Springfield and Baltimore districts enjoy a relatively diverse
economic base which better sustains farm land values and offers
greater off—farm employment opportunities during bad times for
agriculture. Still, it seems not all of the differences among
districts' FLB portfolio quality in 1985 can be attributed to
different incidence of shocks. In 1979, at the end of the boom
period, the six districts with below—average ratios of performing
unmatured principal—to—total loan items were: Louisville, St. Louis,
Omaha, Wichita, Texas, Sacramento, and Spokane. With the exception
of Texas and Sacramento, these districts also show below—average
portfolio quality in 1985. Though such comparisons are not
conclusive, they suggest that relatively liberal loan qualification
standards may have played a part In the adverse recent experiences
of some Land Banks.
44. Average—cost pricing has created a widening interest rate
differential between FCS intermediaries and their marginal—cost—
pricing competitors. For example, in June 1986, interest rates on
flexible—rate Federal Land Bank mortgages ranged from 11.5 to 12.5
percent, while insurance companies and commercial banks typically were
charging rates on mortgages in the range of 10 to 10.5 percent——
adjusting for mortgage fee differentials (see the Crittenden Ag
Financing Newsletter, various issues, 1986).

45. Estimated pay—downs for the first five months of 1986 for all twelve
districts totaled $1.6 billion——roughly 2.7 percent of total FCS
loans. District surveys indicate that the primary reason given for
these pay—downs was high interest rates; the majority of borrowers
who withdrew from the FCS switched to competing institutions. Loan pay—down
data were provided by Robert Jensen of the Farm Credit
Corporation of America.
46. The farmer's credentials——including a "Farm and Home Plan"——are
examined by local county supervisors whose decisions are approved on
a pro—forma basis by county committees. The Farm and Home Plan

— 42

contains information on current debts and assets, as well as
historical and projected cash flow. Loan qualification standards
are the same for direct as for guaranteed loans.

where:

Cash receipts from farm marketings: Economic Indicators of the Farm Sector:
State Income and Balance Sheet Statistics, U.S.D.A., 1984, Table 4.

a price index constructed by weighting an annual series of national commodity

P =

prices by the quantity of output produced in 1980 for the five agricultural
products of each state with the greatest sales in 1980. The annual price data
from 1977 to 1984 were obtained from various tables in U.S.D.A., Agricultural
Statistics, 1985. The cash receipts for the top five products in each state in
1980 was taken from Table 2 of Economic Indicators of the Farm Sector. The
products used to construct this index were: cattle, dairy, soybeans, corn,
wheat, hogs, broilers, cotton, eggs, tobacco, hay, rice, turkeys, grapes,
Potatoes, oranges, sorghum, apples, forestry, tomatoes, green peas, sugar beets,
barley, dry beans, and peanuts. "Nursery and greenhouse products" were excluded
because of ambiguities associated with the price for these products.
RE = the average real value (deflated by- the GNP deflator) of farmland in the state,
as of January 1, obtained from Farm Real Estate Market Developments, U.S.D.A.,
1984.

F = the number of F.D.I.C. board actions (liquidations and forced acquisitions and
mergers) pertaining to commercial banks in each state in each year, collected
from Annual Reports of the FDIC, 1977—1984.
Loan Chargeoffs = net loan chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans at agricultural
banks in each state in each year, taken from Emanuel Melichar, "Agricultural
Banking Experience, 1985" (Mimeograph, Preliminary Data Appendix, Tabulated
March 8, 1986), Table E.7.
INT = total interest payments on debt, collected from Economic Indicators of
the Farm Sector: State Income and Balance Sheet Statistics (U.S.D.A.,
1980, Tables 11—12; and 1984, Tables 25—30).
INC = gross income of the state farm sector, taken from Economic Indicators of
the Farm Sector: State Income and Balance Sheet Statistics, (U.S.D.A.,
1980, Table 4; and 1984, Table 5).
FS =

the

fraction of total sales in 1982, by state, generated by farms with sales
per farm falling between $40,000 and 99,000 (1982 dollars), collected from the
1982 Census of Agriculture, Table 3.

Debt = the estimated market value of total farm debt as of January 1 from Economic
Indicators of the Farm Sector: State Income and Balance Sheet Statistics
(U.S.D.A., 1984, Tables T43—T44).

Equity = the estimated market value of total farm equity as of January 1 from
Economic Indicators of the Farm Sector: State Income and Balance Sheet
Statistics (U.S.D.A., 1984, Table B2).

a Source: authors' calculations. The mean is total real farm marketings
divided by the number of farms. The median and ninetieth percentile point of
distribution of farm sales (in 1984 dollars), the number of farms with sales
between $50,000 and $150,000, and the fraction of gross income generated by
farms with sales between S50,000 and $150,000 (in 1984 dollars) were estimated
assuming that sales per farm is lognormally distributed. All deflation was
done using the farm price index from the Economic Report of the President
(Council of Economic Advisors, 1986).
