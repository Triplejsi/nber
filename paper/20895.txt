Understanding Heterogeneity in the Effects of Birth Weight on Adult Cognition and Wages

NBER Working Paper No. 20895
January 2015
JEL No. I1,J1,J24
ABSTRACT
A large economics literature has shown long term impacts of birth weight on adult outcomes, including
IQ and earnings that are often robust to sibling or twin fixed effects. We examine potential mechanisms
underlying these effects by incorporating findings from the genetics and neuroscience literatures.
We use a sample of siblings combined with an “orchids and dandelions hypothesis”, where the IQ
of genetic dandelions is not affected by in utero nutrition variation but genetic orchids thrive under
advantageous conditions and wilt in poor conditions. Indeed, using variation in three candidate genes
related to neuroplasticity (APOE, BDNF, and COMT), we find substantial heterogeneity in the associations
between birth weight and adult outcomes, where part of the population (i.e., “dandelions”) is not affected
by birth weight variation. Our results help uncover why birth weight affects adult outcomes.

1. Introduction
A large literature in economics and other disciplines has established the importance of early nutrition
environments, which is often measured by birth weight, on both short and long term outcomes. Short
term impacts are most straightforward to motivate, where babies born with low birth weight, from
having lower levels of intrauterine nutrition or are otherwise unhealthy, have been shown to have
higher infant mortality and have higher medical care costs (Almond, Chay and Lee 2005). The existence
and magnitude of longer term (i.e., adult) impacts are less obvious but have been the subject of a
growing body of work.2 One motivation for this line of research is the fetal origins hypothesis by Barker
(1995) who provides evidence that individuals born with low birth weight are prone to heart disease and
type 2 diabetes later in life. In economics, Black et al. (2007) further test and extend this hypothesis by
showing that birth weight differences between twins have lifelong impacts on IQ, labor force
participation, and earnings. These findings are further supported by a number of natural experiments.
A long term follow up of individuals who were in utero during the Dutch Hunger Winter (Stein et al.
1975), in which fetuses were exogenously exposed to poor intrauterine nutrition during the famine of
1944-45, have been shown to have later experienced a range of negative health and economic
outcomes (Stein et al. 2005, de Roij et al. 2010, Schultz et al. 2012). Additionally, individuals in utero
during the month of Ramadan, which is associated with diurnal fasting, are shown to have reduced birth
weights, leading to reduced mental performance later in life (Almond and Mazumder 2011).
The biological mechanisms linking poor nutrition in utero and long term effects on cognition are
not fully developed, but several hypotheses have been proposed. A tenant of the fetal origins
hypothesis is that nutritional insults cause the body to shift resources to the brain, leaving other organ
systems prone to future deficits from this critical period of under-development. Heterogeneity in the
ability to shift resources as well as differences in the potential plasticity in neurodevelopment suggests

and 18. For “longer run” impacts see Conley and Bennett 2000, Conley et al. 2003, and Hack et al. 2002.

there could be varying impacts on cognition as well as health across individuals born with low birth
weight.
Even with these hypothesized resource shifts to protect the brain, there is also ample evidence
of long term effects on cognition. Most related to the current work is the evidence of effects of early
nutrition on cognitive development, particularly IQ in early adulthood.3 A positive and statistically
significant association between birth weight and IQ has been found in a number of studies and samples
(see e.g., Black et al. 2007; Newcombe et al. 2007). For example Newcombe et al. (2007) finds that a
kilogram increase in birth weight is associated with a 3 point increase in IQ. Furthermore, this link
between birth weight and IQ is found within MZ twin pairs, decreasing the likelihood of spurious results
from unmeasured family background or genetics. This has important economic consequences, as IQ has
both direct and indirect impacts on lifetime earnings, schooling decisions, and criminal and risky
behavior (Heckman et al. 2006, Gensowski 2013). However, there is currently limited understanding of
the mechanisms linking low birth weight with adult IQ and labor market outcomes. Physiologically,
emerging evidence suggests that birth weight has a positive, linear association with regional surface
area and total volume of the brain (Walhovd et al. 2012). Additional research to further uncover
mechanisms could allow us to gain a better understanding of the determinants of adult IQ and
productivity as well as, more speculatively, to suggest avenues to target resources at individuals most
likely to be affected by low birth weight.

research to further uncover mechanisms could allow us to gain a better understanding of the
determinants of adult IQ and productivity as well as, more speculatively, to suggest avenues to target
resources at individuals most likely to be affected by low birth weight.
The main idea of the current work is to explore whether genetic variation related to
neuroplasticity may be essential sources of heterogeneity in the impacts of low birth weight on adult
outcomes. The framework follows that proposed by previous studies examining the moderating
properties of particular genetic variants within varied environments.4 The idea being that certain
genetic variants moderate, or amplify, the effects of exposure to a treatment—and this variation in
impact may then help us understand mechanisms linking low birth weight with adult outcomes.
In short, our main hypothesis is that candidate genetic variants, which have a previously shown
relationship with an ability of the brain to strengthen or rewire neural connections, what we refer to
broadly as neuroplasticity, moderate the negative association between low birth weight and later life
cognitive performance. 5 With this understanding, we estimate a within-family multiplicative interaction
between birth weight and a candidate gene neuroplasticity risk score. To preview our findings, birth
weight is shown to have a strong positive association with later-life IQ only for individuals endowed with
few neuroplastic variants, whereas the most plastic individuals have no statistically significant
association between birth weight and IQ. Furthermore, we are able to control for common
environmental conditions amongst siblings, allowing us to account for shared harmful or beneficial post4

One of the first, and most famous, papers on gene-environment interactions is by Caspi et al. (2003), in which the
authors show that childhood abuse leads to more severe later-life depression for individuals containing a gene
variant, or allele, for the serotonin transporter gene 5-HTT. For review, please see Rutter et al. (2005) and Caspi
and Moffitt (2006). Additional studies that are similar in spirit and design include Shanahan et al. (2008) and
Thompson (2014).

natal environments that may also influence IQ. The leveraging of the within-sibling genome also allows
a quasi-experiment in genetics, as genetic variation between full biological siblings is random and has
been labeled as a “genetic lottery” in prior work (Fletcher and Lehrer 2009, 2011).
1.1 Neuroplasticity
Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to maintain and strengthen neural connections as well
as developing new connections between neurons (Pascual-Leon et al. 2005).6 It is a constant process of
strengthening and replacing neural connections, affecting the structure and function of axons,
dendrites, and synapses (Teter and Ashford 2002). Plasticity is commonly invoked after brain injuries, or
insults, such as a stroke; after which, neural networks are re-organized from damaged to undamaged
areas within the brain (Frost et al. 2003, Pascual-Leon et al. 2005). Other examples of neuroplasticity
are found in the increased sensitivity in touching and hearing in the blind. For our purposes, plasticity
represents an ability to respond to environmental shocks—i.e., poor early life nutrition. Individuals with
greater plasticity, or individuals who are more able to recover from negative cognitive shocks, should be
cognitively robust to a poor in utero environment. In other words, birth weight may not be a major
predictor of cognitive development, or earnings, for individuals with greater neuroplasticity.
In order to measure neuroplasticity, we will use the variation in genetic markers. The genes
under consideration are APOE, COMT, and BDNF. All three genes are associated with neuroplasticity,
both directly and in relation to one another.7 The three genes were selected because they are the only
ones available in the WLS dataset that have been shown to be related to neuroplasticity in the
literature, as we document below.8 Focusing only on these three genes allows us to reduce to concern

6

Neuroplasticity is not solely a positive, or favorable, condition. Continual remapping may lead to degenerative
conditions (Pascual-Leon 2005, Teter and Ashford 2002).
7
All genetic variants under consideration are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). A SNP is a single change
along a sequence of DNA. For example, “ATA” versus “ATC”, where the “A” and “C” are variants for the third
nucleic base in the sequence. Each SNP under consideration is assigned a reference, or “rs,” number.

of multiple hypothesis testing. 9 We also show below that the results are robust to a number of different
ways of measuring neuroplasticity based on these three genes.
APOE (apolipoprotein E) is associated with the transportation of lipids, or fatty acids, within the
brain. The gene variant under consideration for the current work is the E4 variant, which has strong
associations with Alzheimer’s disease.10 APOE4 is particularly poor at removing plaques within neural
pathways, resulting in poor synaptic plasticity (Tromer et al. 2005); therefore, the E4 variant has a
negative association with neuroplasticity.11 When constructing our measure for neuroplasticity, we
consider individuals who do not have the E4 variant for the APOE gene.
The Val66Met locus (rs6265) of the BDNF (brain-derived neutrophic factor) gene has been
shown to be related to neuroplasticity.12 BDNF is a protein associated with nerve growth, which is
influenced by both the genotype as well as by early life stress (Roceri et al. 2002, Duman and Monteggia
2006). The presence of this protein is positively associated with hippocampal plasticity and
development (Mizuno et al. 2000, Witte et al. 2012). Therefore, the genetic variant associated with
greater production of this protein, and greater robustness to early stress—the Val, or “A” variant of SNP
rs6265—is considered for our measure of neuroplasticity.
The COMT gene is associated with the production of the catechol-O-methyl transferase protein,
an enzyme that breaks down catecholamines--e.g., dopamine. The Met variant of the Val158Met locus
(rs4680) is associated with reduced production of COMT and a higher corresponding level of dopamine
in the prefrontal cortex. This particular variant of the COMT gene has a debatable, direct impact on

9

For example, the Health and Retirement Study has recently released over 2 million genetic variants for each of
the over 12,000 respondents in the genetic sample. This would allow a nearly infinite number of ways to
characterize neuroplasticity, and similarly allow a very large number of regressions to be examined, leading to
multiple-comparison concerns.
10
The four variants of the APOE gene are determined by two SNPs: rs429358 and rs7412. The E4 variant is defined
as having a “C” variant for each.
11
The negative association between the E4 variant and plasticity may be one reason for its correlation with
Alzheimer’s disease (Teter and Ashford 2002).

memory.13 For our purposes, the Met variant of the COMT gene, and the corresponding increase in
prefrontal dopamine, is theorized to interact with BDNF by increasing long-term potentiation, a key
determinant of neuroplasticity.14 This is confirmed in Witte et al. (2012), who find the Met variant of the
rs4680 SNP in COMT has an interactive effect with the Val variant of the rs6265 SNP in the BDNF gene in
increasing neuroplasticity.
Our baseline measure for neuroplasticity is the sum of the number of favorable variants for each
neuroplasticity gene mentioned above, where every individual has two copies for each gene—one from
the mother and one from the father. For APOE, the favorable variant is simply not having the E4 variant;
for BDNF, the Val allele is favorable for neuroplasticity; and for COMT, the Met allele is favorable.
Therefore, each individual has 0, 1, or 2 favorable variants, and the additive score of the three
neuroplasticity genes takes a value between 0 and 6(see Figure 2 below for the distribution in our
sample). The additive neuroplasticity score is similar to recently used genetic risk scores (see e.g., Belsky
et al. 2012, Plomin et al. 2009); however, a key difference is that the SNPs used in the construction of
the neuroplasticity “risk” score are not from a genome wide association study, but are candidate genes
that have a previously shown relationship with neuroplasticity. As a check to this specification, we also
explore the multiplicative interaction for the total number of favorable variants as well as an indicator
for individuals who have at least one copy of each favorable gene variant.15 Appendix B also shows
results for each gene in isolation.
In summary, neuroplasticity represents the ability of an individual to respond to cognitively
damaging environments—i.e., poor in utero nutrition. To measure neuroplasticity, we explore three
genes that have a biological association with neuroplasticity. We hypothesize that the neuroplasticity

neurons (Bliss and Collinridge 1993).

interaction between BDNF and COMT, as well as the strong negative effects associated with the E4 variant of

genes under consideration moderate the effect of birth weight, or early nutrition, on cognition and adult
wages.
1.2 Differential Susceptibility
A recent line of research in biology, genetics, and evolution, among other disciplines has started to
attempt explanations for the evolution of favorable and unfavorable traits within specific environments.
A first focus was the Stress-Diathesis hypothesis, which suggested that “risky” genotypes would face
severe consequences when placed in “risky environments” (e.g. Caspi et al. 2003). An open question for
this hypothesis is why natural selection would favor genotypes that are “risky” with no compensating
benefit to the organism. In in response to this issue, the Differential Susceptibility hypothesis has
emerged, which is more commonly known as “orchids and dandelions” (Belsky 2005). It argues that
some individuals are robust to environmental exposure, both positive and negative (i.e., dandelions).
Other individuals, however, are sensitive to the environment in which they are placed (i.e., orchids). At
the level of a species, it would be advantageous to have both “types” of individuals—those who are
relatively insensitive to modest changes in the environment, and those who could survive (and thrive)
given large unforeseen changes in the environment.
For our purposes, neuroplasticity can be seen as a mechanism for environmental robustness.
Our main argument is that the in utero environment is unlikely to affect individuals with greater
neuroplasticity. These plastic individuals are dandelions while those without genetic variants that
promote plasticity are orchids.

2. Data and Empirical Methodology
2.1 Data
The data come from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). The WLS is a random sample composed of
one-third of 1957 high school graduates. Additional data has been collected from a selected sibling and
from spouses of the graduates. Of importance to the current work is data on both the graduates and

8

their selected siblings, for which data were collected in 1957, 1964, 1975, 1992, and 2003 and 1977,
1993, and 2004, respectively.
Our base sample consists of 469 sibling pairs (938 individuals). As will be explained shortly, the
sibling sample is needed to control for both unobserved genes and environments, which may lead to
spurious estimates. The WLS contains data on IQ, our primary dependent variable of interest, for
roughly 17,000 individuals: 11,000 graduates and 6,000 selected siblings.16 A large portion of this
available data is unused, however, due to the availability of birth weight and DNA data, which were
collected in 2003 (2004), a time when the graduates and siblings were roughly 60 years of age. The
sample of individuals who report both birth weight and DNA data is less than one-third of our 17,000
sample, from which data are used for roughly 3,800 individuals: 2,600 graduates and 1,200 siblings.
Furthermore, data for complete sibling pairs reduces the sample of individuals with DNA and birth
weight data from 3,800 to 938. This reduced sample constitutes our base sample and is composed of
sibling pairs with complete data on DNA, birth weight, IQ, and other covariates used in estimation.
Due to the birth weight and DNA data being collected at such a late period, sample selection is a
concern.17 It is likely that surviving until the 2003 (2004) wave is correlated with IQ and other economic
and health measures. Therefore, we construct an attrition weight by first regressing an indicator for
being in the sibling-pair sample on IQ, birth year, sex, and a sibling indicator.18 Next, the inverse of this

16

These data are truncated slightly by the availability of other covariates used within the paper. The appendix
contains summary statistics for a large number of possible samples.
17
A further concern is in the retrospective collection of birth weight in 2003, a time in which the participants are in
their mid-60s. While we cannot rule out error, we have no reason to believe that any error in self-reported birth
weight is non-random. For example, Jaworowicz et al. (2010) find no evidence of demographic differences in birth
weight errors, implying the errors are potentially random and can be used for unbiased estimation. Furthermore
as shown in previous studies, the amount of error in retrospective reports of birth weight is generally small. For
example, O'Sullivan, Mark, and Louise (2000) find more than 75% of parental reports are within 50 g of that
recorded in hospital records and found no difference in reporting errors by socioeconomic status. Yaw, Vera, and
Steven (1998) find a median misreport of birth weight of 10 g between mother and hospital records. Hewson and
Bennett (1987) also note that hospital records are not always error-free. Jaworowicz et al. (2010) find self-reported
measures of birth weight are highly correlated with hospital records, with 67% being identical.
18
Siblings have greater variation in age, as well as compromising a greater proportion of individuals with birth
weight and DNA data.

9

probability is used as an attrition weight in estimation, potentially correcting for issues associated with
sample selection. Comparing summary statistics across sample specifications in the appendix, the
sample weights appear to correct for the differences in IQ, as well as other variables. Indeed, the
(weighted) summary statistics for the analysis sample is nearly identical to the full sample of 17,000
individuals (see Table A1).19
Our primary dependent variable throughout the paper is IQ, which is mapped from HenmonNelson test scores and is representative of IQ for high school juniors. As an additional dependent
variable, we also use the hourly wage rate in 1992 (1993). This variable is intended to capture economic
productivity differences. The data from 1992 (1993) represent a period in which most of our sample is
working (i.e, graduates are roughly 53 years of age) and has the greatest amount of coverage across
waves.
As described in Section 1.1, our main independent variable of interest is neuroplasticity, which is
measured in several ways, including by the interaction between 3 genes associated with neuroplasticity.
These 3 genes are APOE, BDNF, and COMT. The plastic allele of APOE is defined as not being the E4
variant. The E4 variant is represented by having a “C” variant at both SNP rs429358 and SNP rs7412.20
The plastic variant is coded as 2 if an individual has no copies of the E4 variant, as 1 if the individual
contains one copy of the E4 variant, and 0 for two copies.21 For BDNF, the Val variant is seen as plastic.
This is defined as having a “G” variant at SNP rs6265, where having two “G” variants is coded as 2, one

19

The Vital Statistics of 1950 provide the first national data on birth weight. Using this data as a proxy for a
nationally representative birth weight cohort, we are able to assess the validity of the birth weight statistics for our
base sibling sample, the majority of which were born in 1940. For 1950, the average birth weight in the U.S. is
3,310 grams, which is comparable with 3,367 grams, the average birth weight of our sibling sample. For whites in
1950, which is more representative of our base sibling sample, the average birth weight is 3,320 grams.
Furthermore, 7.6% of births are less than 2,500 grams in 1950 compared to roughly 8% for our sibling sample.
20
In our base sibling sample, the frequencies of the “C” variant for SNP rs429358 and rs7412 are 14.9% and 92%,
respectively; this is comparable to frequencies in the 1000 Genomes project, which give frequencies in European
populations of 14% and 93% (McVean et al. 2012).
21
Every individual has two copies of each gene: one from the mother and one from the father.

10

“G” variant is coded as 1, and having no “G” variants is coded as 0.22 For COMT, the Met variant is
associated with neuroplasticity. The “A” variant of SNP rs4680 is associated with lower enzymatic
activity and increased plasticity. The “A” variant for this SNP of COMT is coded in an identical manner to
the “G” variant of SNP rs6265 for BDNF.23
Our main measure of neuroplasticity is the additive score across these three genes (i.e., APOE
BDNF COMT), giving a minimum of 0 and maximum of 6.24 The sum is used to measure neuroplasticity
because each of the three genetic variants has been shown to have an effect on plasticity, both
separately in conjunction: BDNF and COMT have a previously documented interaction in plasticity,
whereas the E4 variant of APOE is highly damaging to plasticity (Trommer et al. 2005, Witte et al. 2012).
For our base sibling sample, individuals contain on average 4.35 plastic alleles. For robustness, we will
also use the multiplicative interaction of plastic alleles and an indicator for possessing at least one
plastic variant at each locus as well as examine effects for each single gene in Appendix B. Other
covariates include sex, birth order, birth year, a sibling indicator, mother’s education, father’s education,
and a score for socio-economic status, though several of the measures (as well as all shared family
characteristics) will be subsumed in our preferred family fixed effects specification.
An additional issue in the use of our sample (and the WLS more broadly) is the lack of ethnic
diversity. Our base sibling sample is composed entirely of peoples of European descent.25 This implies
that any findings may not be generalizable to a larger, more ethnically diverse population such as the

22

In comparison to frequencies in the 1000 Genomes Project, our base sample frequency of the Val variant is
80.5%, whereas the European frequency in 1000 Genomes is 80% (McVean et al. 2012).
23
In our base sibling sample, the frequency of the Met variant of rs4680 is 51.1%. This is roughly identical to the
52% frequency within European populations (McVean et al. 2012).
24
Section B within the Supplemental Appendix analyzes the associations of each plastic gene separately as well as
each 2-way additive score. Results, while not always statistically significant, are similar in sign and magnitude.

Our results are unlikely to be biased by genetic, or environmental, clustering across ethnicities.26
2.2 Empirical Methodology
Our main empirical strategy considers the interaction between our genetic measure of neuroplasticity
and exposure in early childhood, or in utero, to poor nutrition, for which birth weight is used as a proxy.
Our main estimating equation is given by the following form:

where we consider individuals within families. Our main outcome of interest is IQ, and the
coefficient of interest is

, which measures the association of the interaction between birth weight and

neuroplasticity. Our hypothesis being that
weight, measured by

is negative and significant, while the main effect of birth

, is positive and significant. This finding would be consistent with the hypothesis

that the early nutrition environment does play a role in cognitive development, but that this effect is
reduced in “plastic” individuals. All estimations also include individual and family level controls—
represented by

and

, respectively—that include family SES and education, individual demographic

characteristics, as well as within family dynamics, such as birth order, that have effects on learning and
cognition (Black et al. 2005).
In addition to individual and family level controls, our extended estimating equation includes
family, or sibling, fixed effects.27 As argued in Fletcher and Lehrer (2011), Conley and Rauscher (2012),
and Cook and Fletcher (2013), the inclusion of sibling fixed effects control for both unobserved genetic
and environmental influences, which may bias estimation. Since siblings share approximately 50% of
unique genetic variation, sibling fixed effects partially (i.e., 50%) control for unobserved genetic
influences that may bias the gene-environment interaction by accounting for a latent gene-gene

27

Within family estimation should also eliminate bias associated with population stratification.
In the sibling fixed effects specification, shared family-level controls are excluded.

12

interaction.28 In addition to controlling for potentially unobserved gene-gene interactions, the use of
sibling fixed effects also allows us to control, in part, for heritable IQ shared between siblings (Black et
al. 2009). The use of sibling fixed effects also allows the genetic variation in our sample to be considered
quasi-exogenous, as differences in genotype of full biological siblings is the outcome of a “genetic
lottery” (Fletcher and Lehrer 2009, 2011).
While controlling for unobserved genetic variation is important in verifying the effect of the GE
interaction, it is also important to control for unobserved environmental differences across families.
Birth weight is plausibly exogenous between siblings, but may be associated with income or education
across families. We are able to control for parental income and education; however, there are many
unobservables across families (e.g., parental attention, post-natal nutrition, childhood activities, quality
of education, etc.) that are associated with cognitive development and high school IQ. Furthermore,
across family variation is strongly associated with cognitive development (Carneiro and Heckman 2003,
Cunha et al. 2006, Heckman and Masterov 2004). Therefore, we use within family specification for our
preferred results.29
However, the use of within-family estimation does not eliminate the potential for bias arising
across time. We are unable to account for across time differences that may be associated with both
birth weight and later-life outcomes—e.g., differences in gestation or mother’s nutrition, income, and
smoking behavior between siblings’ birth.30 In other words, we are unable to account for insults that
potentially have independent associations with fetal development, measured by birth weight, and laterlife outcomes. Through exploiting a number of natural experiments and by focusing the analysis on

28

Indeed, the principle of the independent assortment of genes across the genome (especially genes not in close
proximity) suggests a limited role for gene-gene interactions as a possible alternative-hypothesis for our results.
29
Descriptive statistics for our sibling sample based on discordant/concordant siblings are included in Section A of
the Supplemental Appendix.
30
A partial control for the differential timing of births is found from the inclusion of birth year in our baseline set of
controls. Assuming incomes rise throughout the life-course, later birth years correspond to improved parental
income; however, birth year is unable to capture income shocks.

twins, who are born at the same, a large number of studies have indeed found an effect of birth weight
on later life cognition.31 For the current study, however, the exogeneity of birth weight cannot be
established. Therefore, our proposed relationship between birth weight and cognition in high school
may be the product of an unobserved time difference across siblings’ births, and any results found using
this relationship should not be interpreted as causative.32 In addition to the exogeneity concerns of our
environmental difference of interest, birth weight, we are unable to fully account for the mechanism in
which our genetic variants of interest are associated with IQ. While we will show that no statistically
significant association exists between either neuroplastic variant or combinations thereof, we cannot
rule out that these genetic variants influence IQ through additional channels.33 Given the endogeneity
concerns of both our environmental and genetic variables of interest, we view our results showing
evidence of genetic moderation in the associations between birth weight and IQ to be suggestive but
not conclusive.
All tables are organized as following: column (1) presents OLS estimates of the estimating
equation above, excluding sibling fixed effects; column (2) weights the estimation of column (1) by the
inverse of the probability of being in our base sibling-pair sample; and column (3) performs within family
estimation, excluding family-level controls.

31

See Almond and Currie (2011) for comprehensive review.
A further complicating factor is tied to parental investments, from which the poor nutritional status of low birth
weight individuals is lessened/reinforced from increased/decreased parental investment, leading to a
convergence/further divergence in outcomes between siblings (Datar, Kilburn, and Loughran 2010). For our
analysis, this potential complication is alleviated due to the random assignment of our genetic endowment of
interest. While low birth weight individuals may receive less or more parental investments, we have no reason to
suspect that this investment is correlated with the unobserved and randomly determined genetic endowment of
each sibling.
33
Of particular concern is the possibility of a gene-environment correlation, or rGE. Passive rGE implies a genetic
variant is associated with an expressed trait in the parent that influences early life outcomes or birth weight. This
genetic variant is then passed to the offspring; however, given that our preferred specification controls for
unobserved characteristics shared between siblings, this mechanism is not a major concern. Evocative rGE implies
that the offspring’s genotype affects the in utero environment in some way that would produce changes in birth
weight and IQ.

3. Results
3.1 Baseline
Associations between neuroplasticity, measured by the interaction of corresponding gene variants, and
birth weight on high school IQ are examined in Table 1. All columns in Table 1 include all relevant
individual and family level controls, which include birth order, birth year, a sibling indicator, sex,
mother’s education, father’s education, and family-level SES in 1957 with standard errors clustered at
the family level. The OLS estimation of column (1) shows that while birth weight does have a positive
and significant association with later-life IQ, our genetic measure for neuroplasticity does not have a
statistically significant relationship with IQ. This is to be expected; our hypothesis is that neuroplasticity
is associated with correcting cognitively harmful environments, not directly improving IQ; indeed, our
genetic variants of interest have not been shown to have direct effects on IQ in gene discovery exercises
from the genetics literature.34 The estimated coefficient of birth weight in column (1) implies that a one
standard deviation increase in birth weight is associated with roughly one and a half points increase in
IQ. Considering the findings in Newcombe et al. (2007), our estimated effect of birth weight is not
significantly different than the finding of a one kilogram increase in birth weight being associated with a
3 point increase in IQ. For our coefficient, an increase of one kilogram (or roughly 1.5 standard
deviations) is predicted to increase IQ by 2.2 points, for which the 95% confidence interval contains the
Newcombe et al. estimate of 3 points.
The estimates of columns (2) and (3), which weight the estimation by the inverse of the
probability of being within our base sibling sample and include sibling fixed effects, respectively, do not
differ substantially from the simple OLS findings of column (1). The estimates of column (2) provide
34

One assumption we make is that favorable and harmful shocks are equally distributed across the life course.
This assumption implies that plastic individuals, while likely to have relatively positive responses to IQ from
harmful shocks, are less likely to benefit from favorable shocks that may improve IQ. Therefore, we expect no
significant direct relationship between our measure of neuroplasticity and high school IQ. Additionally, excessive
neuroplasticity is hypothesized to be positively associated with harmful addictive behaviors and obsessive
compulsive disorder that potentially limit the benefits of increased birth weight (Koob and Le Moal 2005,
Fitzgerald et al. 2010).

15

evidence that the significant, positive association of birth weight on IQ and the insignificant statistical
association between our measure of neuroplasticity and IQ is not being driven by our sample of sibling
pairs with both DNA and birth weight data. Furthermore, these findings are confirmed by within family
estimation of column (3), reducing the possibility of a spurious relationship due to unobserved siblingshared genetic or environmental variables. In summary, birth weight has a positive association with IQ,
while our measure of neuroplasticity has no statistical association with IQ.
Table 2 regresses birth weight on our genetic measure for neuroplasticity. The purpose of Table
2 is to establish the independence of our gene and environment. Our primary focus is on the interaction
between genes for neuroplasticity and birth weight, a proxy for the early nutrition environment, with
the main hypothesis being that individuals with more genetic variants related to neuroplasticity are less
likely to be influenced by the early nutrition environment. Therefore, in order to ensure a true
interaction, not a spurious correlation, we need to ensure that our genes of interest are not influencing
our environment of interest. The estimates of Table 2 provide no evidence that the genes selected to
measure neuroplasticity are influencing birth weight. Additionally, genome wide association studies
provide no evidence for a significant association between our proposed neuroplasticity variants and
birth weight (Freathy et al. 2010). We have no reason to believe gene-environment correlation will lead
to a spurious coefficient for our gene-environment interaction investigation.
3.2 Gene-Environment Interaction
Figure 1 plots the relationship between birth weight and high school IQ for individuals above and below
the median number of plasticity alleles. The positive association between birth weight and IQ is much
more pronounced for those individuals who possess fewer than or equal to the median number of
plasticity alleles. Conversely, plastic individuals do not exhibit any significant association between birth
weight and IQ. The findings of Figure 1 support the differential response to the early nutrition
environment based upon genotype. Furthermore, Figure 1 is in the same spirit as similar figures within

16

the differential susceptibility literature. To more accurately account for the differential effect of birth
weight, Figure 2 plots the coefficient of birth weight for individuals with varying numbers of plastic
alleles. As is shown in Figure 2, birth weight has a positive and significant association with IQ for those
individuals with less than or equal to 4 plastic alleles; however, for individuals with greater than 4 plastic
variants, no positive significant effect of birth weight is found.35
The estimates of Table 3 confirm the findings of Figure 1 and also provide a basis for the geneenvironment estimation. Columns (1) and (2) show that birth weight has a positive and highly significant
effect on IQ for individuals possessing less than or equal the median number of plastic alleles. The
coefficient is roughly identical for both the simple OLS specification of column (1) and the within family
model of column (2). For column (2), a one standard deviation increase in birth weight is associated with
an increase of roughly 2 points in IQ. The magnitude of the coefficient for non-plastic individuals is
slightly larger in magnitude than similar estimation found in Table 1, which includes both plastic and
non-plastic siblings.36
Columns (3) and (4) replicate the estimation of columns (1) and (2) but restrict the sample to
more plastic individuals. As a result, the coefficient of birth weight becomes statistically
indistinguishable from zero. The findings of Table 3 support the differential impact of birth weight
based upon markers for neuroplasticity: More plastic individuals gain no benefit from added birth
weight, whereas less plastic individuals have a strong cognitive association to the in utero nutrition
environment.
Our baseline estimating equation is explored in Table 4. The estimates of Table 4 test our main
hypothesis: the effect of the early nutrition environment is moderated by individuals with flexible, or
35

Section F within the supplementary appendix provides further support for heterogeneity in the effects of birth
weight on later-life IQ.
36
552 individuals, or 276 sibling pairs, are discordant for our genetic measure of neuroplasticity, representing 59%
of our base sample. For birth weight, our environment of interest, 894 individuals are discordant, and for the
interaction between the neuroplasticity and birth weight, 914 individuals are discordant. Separate estimation for
each discordant sample is found within Supplemental Appendix A.

17

easily repaired, neural networks. A negative coefficient on the GE interaction provides support for this
hypothesis by lessening the marginal effect of birth weight, for which a positive and significant
association with IQ is found in Table 1. Column (1) of Table 4 estimates Equation 1 while excluding
sibling fixed effects. All signs are as expected. Importantly, the coefficient on the GE interaction is
negative and significant at the 1% level. As an individual contains more and more plastic alleles, the
positive marginal effect of birth weight dissipates. For the mean number of plasticity alleles, the
marginal effect of birth weight is halved; while for individuals with the maximum number of plasticity
alleles the marginal effect of birth weight is insignificantly different than zero.
The estimates of Table 4 support our main hypothesis. Birth weight has a positive association
with IQ for less plastic individuals but does not have a lasting effect for individuals with numerous plastic
alleles. Importantly, this effect is consistent is across all of our estimation specifications, providing
evidence that this effect is consistent within and across families and that bias due to sample selection is
unlikely.37
Table 5 re-estimates the findings of Table 4 with two alternative measures for neuroplasticity.38
Panel A considers an indicator for those who have at least plastic allele for each neuroplasticity gene
under consideration. The use of the dummy is to broadly capture the more plastic individuals. As in
Table 4, the interaction between this indicator and birth weight is negative, implying that those more
broadly defined plastic individuals are less affected by the early nutrition environment. Specifically for
our within family estimation of column (3), the effect of birth weight on IQ is reduced by two-thirds for
individuals with at least one plastic allele for each gene. For Panel B, we consider a multiplicative,
37

Placebo tests confirming the role of neuroplasticity in moderating the effect of birth weight on IQ are given in
Appendix E. In checking all other 3-way combinations of available SNPs within the WLS, no significant interaction is
found with birth weight after Bonferroni correction.
38
Alternative measures of birth weight are considered within Supplemental Appendix C. Of note, an insignificant
interaction is found with a simple indicator of low birth, i.e., birth weight less than 2,500 grams. Furthermore,
when using the indicator of low birth, the estimated moderation of birth weight is absent; however, the coefficient
of the interaction is not precisely estimated, which implies that a moderating effect from neuroplasticity can not
be ruled out. The low level of precision may in part be due to the low number of discordant siblings for the low
birth indicator (n = 138).

18

instead of additive, measure for our neuroplasticity genes. With our 3 neuroplasticity genes and 2
copies of each gene, the maximum number of favorable alleles is 8. Looking at the estimates within
Panel B of Table 5, again, the interaction with birth weight is negative, while the main effect of birth
weight is positive. More importantly when considering the within family estimates of column (3), the
marginal effect of birth weight goes to zero as the number of plastic alleles approaches the maximum.
We also show in Appendix B that the results are qualitatively similar if we use each gene variant in
isolation and also vary the measurement of neuroplasticity.
Given that neuroplasticity moderates the effects of birth weight on IQ, we should expect to see
a similar effect on labor market outcomes, particularly wage. Table 6 considers wage, or productivity, in
place of IQ.39 Our wage measure comes from the 1992-3 wave of the WLS, when the graduates and
siblings are on average in their mid-fifties, a time just prior to retirement when wages are likely to be at
a lifetime peak.40 Panel A of Table 6 gives the main effect of our neuroplasticity measure and birth
weight on the natural log of hourly wage in 1992-3, whereas Panel B gives estimates for our geneenvironment interaction model.
For most estimations of Panel A in Table 6, our coefficients of interest, the coefficients of birth
weight and neuroplasticity, are insignificantly different than zero but the sign and magnitude of the
effect of birth weight is as expected. In previous papers, birth weight has been shown to have a positive
and significant impact on earnings; e.g., Black et al. (2007) show that a 10% increase in birth weight is
associated with a 1% increase in income. For column (3) in Panel A, our sibling fixed effects model, a
10% increase in birth weight (~1/2 a standard deviation) is associated with a 5% increase in wage, with a
1% increase contained within the 95% confidence band. The insignificance of our estimates for the

39

Section D within the Supplemental Appendix replicates the findings of Table 6 with the previously specified
alternative measures of neuroplasticity.
40
Table D3 includes a number of other labor market outcomes for the 1992/3 and 2003/4 wave. Prior to the
1992/3 wave, few data were collected on siblings. As shown in Table D3, the coefficients of the interaction model
are similar in sign for all other measures of labor market outcomes but often insignificantly different than zero.

19

coefficient of birth weight may be tied to the relatively small sample for which we have data.
Additionally, insignificance may be due to the absence of accounting for the differential effect of birth
weight from neuroplasticity genes.
For Panel B, we estimate our proposed interaction model, replacing IQ with wages later in life.
The estimated associations of neuroplasticity, birth weight, and the interaction between the two
variables, however, are similar to the regressions with IQ. Birth weight has a positive and statistically
significant association with the wage rate, but the magnitude of this effect is dependent upon our
measure for neuroplasticity. When considering the sibling fixed effects estimation of column (3), a 10%
increase in birth weight is associated with roughly a 15% increase in wage for the least plastic
individuals. For the median, neuroplasticity score, a 10% increase in birth weight is associated with
roughly a 5% increase in wage. And for the maximum neuroplasticity score, a 10% increase in birth
weight is negatively associated with wage. As with IQ, neuroplasticity moderates the associations
between birth weight and later life outcomes.

4. Conclusion
This research questions the ubiquity of fetal programming for cognitive and productivity outcomes. Our
hypothesis is that a portion of the population is more adaptable to early exposure to environmental
insults in regards to cognitive outcomes and the basis of this resiliency stems from the genetics and
biology of the developmental process. This has important consequences for our understanding of the
determinants of long term outcomes, such as IQ and wages as well in our understanding of the
heterogeneity of theses determining processes.
In summary, we argue that neuroplasticity, which we measure through genetic variation,
moderates the impact of the early, in utero nutrition environment. Previous studies have established a
strong link between birth weight and a host of economic and health outcomes. We focus on cognitive
development and show that the positive association between birth weight and IQ dissipates for

20

individuals who have genetic variants associated with neuroplasticity, where neuroplasticity represents
an ability of the brain to correct, or adjust to, harmful prenatal environments. We extend this finding
into a labor market outcome and show that the association between birth weight and productivity
exhibits the same relationship to neuroplasticity as IQ. We also show our findings are quite robust to a
variety of alternative measures of neuroplasticity.

Notes: (i) For Panel A, neuroplasticity is measured by an indicator for having at least one plastic allele for each gene. For Panel
B, the multiplicative interaction of plasticity genes is used to measure neuroplasticity. G × E represents the interaction between
each respective measure of neuroplasticity and standardized birth weight. (ii) Demographic and family controls include race, sex,
birth year (age), birth order, mother’s education, father’s education, and a score for family SES in 1957. (vi) Standard errors are
clustered at the family level with *, **, and *** representing significance at the 10, 5, and 1% significance level, respectively.

Notes: This table performs our base estimation (Table 4) with alternative measures of birth weight. Our base measure of birth
weight is the standard score of birth weight given in grams. Panel A defines birth weight by an indicator for individuals not born
of low birth weight (i.e., 2500 grams). Roughly 8% of our base sibling sample is born under 2,500 grams. Panel B uses unadjusted
measure of birth weight given in grams. And Panel C uses the natural log of birth weight.

Figure E1. Significance of GxE for All 3-way SNP Combinations (excluding Neuroplasticity
SNPs)
Notes: (i) This figure plots t-statistics for the coefficient of the interaction between birth weight and all possible 3-way genetic
combinations (excluding neuroplasticity SNPs). After Bonferroni correction, no coefficient in the above figure remains statistically
significant.

Figure F1. Linear vs. Nonlinear Fit of Birth Weight
Notes: This figure plots the linear association between birth weight and IQ as well as a non-linear, non-parametric association.
Of note, the non-linear effect of birth weight is slightly lessened for low and high birth weight individuals. This finding supports
our hypothesis of hetergoneity in birth weight.

Notes: This table presents estimates from a finite mixture model. Given the relatively smaller, bur roughly similar, BIC, the
2-component model is preferred. For convergence of the model, a simpler set of controls is used. This set includes birth year, birth
order, and family SES. Additionally, no weights are used in estimation.

Notes: This table regresses the responsive group from FMM estimation in Table F1 on our measure of neuroplasticity. For the
2-component model, the size of the responsive group is 29 individuals, comprising roughly 3% of our sample. For the 3-component
model, only 21 individuals, or 2.24% of our base sample, are found within the responsive sample. The negative (and significant in
the 2-component model) coefficient on our measure of neuroplasticity implies more plastic individuals have smaller effects from
birth weight on IQ, supporting our primary hypothesis.
