Comparable Worth in a General Equilibrium

Model of the U.S. Economy

A8STRACT
This paper presents a computable general equilibrium model that

simulates the effects on employment,

output, wages, and economic efficiency of

introducing comparable worth into the U.S. economy. The model calculates

economy-wide aggregate impacts and disaggregated results for individuals
grouped by sex, marital status, and education.
The effects depend on the hiring rules that would accompany comparable

worth, the source of existing male-female

wage differentials, the extent of

coverage of comparable worth, the intra-household behavior of
and demand and supply elasticities.

If, after comparable worth is introduced,

employers are constrained to employ men and women in historical proportions,
the adverse effects on

aggregate employment, output, and efficiency would be

much larger than if the employment constraint is based on applicant
proportions. If existing wage gaps are the result of sex differences in productivity, the adverse effects of comparable worth

smaller. If

of the economy is subject to comparable worth, the efficiency loss

is reduced under the productivity

gap assumption, but increased if the wage

gap is the result of discrimination.

The redistributive effects of comparable worth on married men and women
are sensitive to assumptions about intra-household behavior and the size of
the

gains from marriage. By contrast, unmarried women appear to benefit from
comparable worth under most sets of assumptions while unmarried men lose.

discrimination legislation. Between 1979 and 1983 the ratio advanced five

significantly, equal pay for work of "comparable

primarily by women pay substantially lower wages than jobs held primarily by
men, even when education and other attainments of the

women equal or exceed

those of the men. They claim that jobs can be evaluated by objective standards

such as educational requirements and

any state has yet attempted to enforce a comparable worth standard on the

(Livernash 1980). Attention has been directed

segregation and discrimination (Treiman and

Hartmann 1981), and the direct costs to employers of implementing
comparable
worth (Oi 1986; Remick 1984; Treiinan, Hartmann and Roos 1984). Several
papers
set forth the theoretical case
against comparable worth (Killingsworth 1985;

Fischel and Lazear 1986), while some defend it on theoretical grounds
(Bergmann 1985; Aldrich and Buchele 1986).

Largely missing from the debate are

quantitative estimates of the

employment, efficiency, or distributional

consequences of comparable worth

(however, see Johnson and Solon 1984; Sorensen

1986). Economic theory suggests

that administratively determined wages are likely to be less efficient than
those set by the interplay of demand

and supply. But will the loss be small or
large? What about the redistribution5 that
would occur? Who would gain? Who
would lose? And by how much?
This paper presents a general equilibrjwn model that makes possible
the
calculation of the effects on
employment output, wages, and economic

efficiency of introducing comparable worth into the U.S. economy. We
use a
computable general equilibrium (CGE) model rather than relying on inferences
from a theoretical model for

several reasons. First, full implementation of

equal pay for women and men would

represent a very large discrete change from

the current situation. The usual method of theoretical analysis

small changes at the margin.

Second, the model, though highly aggregated, does attempt to capture several

estimates), nor do we estimate the administrative

probably accompany a comparable worth wage policy, we examine the effects of

the consequences of alternative

The mode], presented in this paper is highly aggregated and static. It is
only a rough approximation to the "real world," but we believe that much can
be learned about comparable worth from it. The process of model construction

forces a consideration of issues such as hiring rules or the nature of the
utility function in married households that have often been ignored in
theoretical discussions. The general equilibrium properties of the model
permit the investigation of the effects on employment, output, and the like
after allowing for demand and supply responses to changes in relative prices
and wages. We hold no brief for any particular assumption or result, but we

believe that the simulations taken as a whole provide many useful insights
concerning the possible effects of comparable worth on the U.S. economy.

2. Modeling Issues
General equilibrium calculations

require a fully specified model of the

economy. Each conceivable specification necessarily reflects different
assumptions

concerning the nature of economic behavior

the context of

and institutions. In

a controversial policy issue such as comparable worth, it

should not be surprising that there is

little agreement concerning the

validity of certain critical assumptions. We emphasize that computational

general equilibrium simulations cannot resolve such

disagreements. Rowever,

they do serve to clarify the links between assumptions and implications.
Accordingly, this section discusses several critical
thereby provides backgrouncj for the

modeling issues, and

assumptions employed in section 4. The

reader should bear in mind that we do not mean to endorse any particular
assumption by including it in our analysis.

A. Pay Differentials
The object of comparable worth is to narrow or eliminate male-female

differentials. To model the effects of this

pay

policy one must adopt some view as

to why these differentials exist in the first

place. This immediately embroils

us in controversy.
Classical economic analysis attributes wage gaps to productivity
differences. The sources of such differences

may be quite subtle. For example,

if women are more likely to leave the labor force (perhaps for
childbearing),
then firms may be reluctant to train women for jobs that require specific
skills, and women would be reluctant to invest
then be forced to settle for lower

in such training. Women might

wages, commensurate with their expected net

marginal products. Under this view, women with

strong attachments to the labor

force are the victims of "statistical discrimination"

Alternatively,

(Phelps 1972).

one might argue that wage gaps do not reflect differences in
4

expected marginal products. This requires one to formulate
of discrimination which accounts for the

an explicit theory

persistence of wage gaps and the

failure of classical equilibriating forces.
In his seminal work, Becker (1971) developed various theories of

discrimination based upon personal tastes. Under this view, the employment of

certain individuals creates disutility for

employers, co-workers, suppliers of

capital, or consumers. In equilibrium, employers

pay such workers their

marginal products, net of external effects. This gives rise to pay
differentials.

More recently, some analysts have devoted increased attention to the
possibility that wage gaps are attributable to market

imperfections arising

from informational problems. One such theory has been dubbed the "invisibility
hypothesis" (Milgrom and Oster 1984). Under this view employers have private
information concerning the abilities of their employees. Promotion signals

competence; promotion of a woman signals exceptional

competence. Thus, an

employer may prefer not to promote a competent woman in order to extract more
surplus associated with her employment.

Other authors have suggested models of

discriminatory hiring policies.

For example, Bulow and Summers (1985) have argued that this phenomenon arises

whenever job terminations are used to discipline workers for
shirking. In their model, men and women are equally productive, and therefore
naturally

must receive the same wage. However, since women are assumed to be less averse

to nonmarket activity, the threat of

terminations will fail to induce

satisfactory effort unless, in equilibrium, women have

more difficulty finding

new jobs once terminated.
-

Another

set of theories envisions discrimination as the consequence of
self-fulfilling prophecies (see, for example, section 4 of Arrow 1971).
S

Under this view, low compensation and

poor employment prospects discourage

women from expending effort or acquiring essential

skills. Employers in turn

pay women less and withhold promotions because women

are less diligent or

skillful. These theories have an interesting and important implication:
policies which force employers to treat men and

women equally may alter

incentives for women, thereby causing women to perform on par with men. This

creates a new self-fulfilling prophecy in which discrimination is nonexistent.
Unfortunately, these more recent models of discrimination do not lend
themselves to a computational framework.
and private information tend to be

Equilibria in models with

uncertainty

extremely complex, and generally depend

upon underlying distributions about which we have no information. When
attributing wage gaps to discrimination, we will therefore

adopt Becker's

framework. In particular, we will assume that discrimination arises from the
tastes of employers.

We acknowledge that this view is not

entirely satisfactory. Specifically,

if the preferences of employers are at all heterogeneous, it becomes
very

difficult to explain the persistence of

discrimination. Nondiscriminatory

firms clearly have lower costs of production. In the short run (with fixed
capital and, consequently, decreasing marginal returns to labor), such firms

will operate on a larger scale than their

discriminatory competitors. In the

long run, capital will flow to the lower cost firms and discriminatory
employers will disappear entirely. Even if the bulk of capitalists
discriminate as well, nondiscriminatory

capitalists will earn higher returns

and eventually dominate. Thus, wage gaps persist only if discriminatory firms

have monopsony power. Theories of wage gaps based upon the preferences of
consumers or co-workers also encounter difficulties, in that long-run
equilibriuju would tend to entail some

appropriate degree of segregation.

6

Accordingly, Becker concluded that discriminatory pay differentials were
likely to be relatively transient.

One need not, however, take the restrictive view that Becker's
discrimination coefficients reflect only the innate preferences of employers
or other groups. Rather, we prefer to think of these coefficients as stylized

analytic tools for introducing wage gaps which are unrelated to productivity.
Various commentators have suggested that the adoption of comparable worth
may hasten the erosion of discrimination against women, or

incentives which lead to the elimination of

may provide

productivity differences (see the

discussion of self-fulfilling prophecies above). We will briefly consider
policy effects under such scenarios by assuming that discrimination
coefficients or productivity differences change systematically subsequent to
implementation

B. Household Behavior
It is important to recognize that comparable worth might have a different
impact on single individuals who are concerned only with their own

market

opportunities than on married individuals who also care about the market

of their spouses. In order to shed light on this and associated
issues we require an explicit model of household behavior.
opportunities

the

One alternative, which we take as the standard case, is to assume that
household acts as a single utility-maximizing agent. It is possible to

this assumption in at least three ways. First, spouses may bargain
over possible actions. As long as bargaining always results in Paretojustify

efficient outcomes (a standard axiom in cooperative game theory), the
household behaves as if it maximizes a single utility function. Second, under
certain conditions, family members who are linked to a household head through
operative resource transfers will act to maximize the utility of the head
7

(Becker 1974). Third, it may be customary for the household head to act

effectively as a dictator.
There are, however, two significant drawbacks

to modeling households in

this way. First, unless one adds additional structure it is impossible to
assess the effect of comparable worth on the
distinct from married men. Second, the

well-being of married women as

adoption of comparable worth may alter

the balance of power in the hOusehold's

decision-making process, thereby

invalidating the practice of using the households

current utility function

for policy simulations.

To address these issues, we consider a second model of household behavior
which imposes more structure

upon decision-making. Specifically, we assume

that spouses bargain over possible actions, and that the outcome of this
process

corresponds to Nash's two-person bargaining solution (Nash 1950). This

implies that the household acts as if
(UM

-

is the utility of spouse i (i—My), u is the utility associated with

spouse i's

threat

point (more on this below), and is a

parameter reflecting

relative bargaining strengths. Nash derived this solution concept from more
primitive axioms (he also imposed a syametry axiom, which effectively implies
that a —

1/2). Other authors have since provided alternative
Justifications

based upon explicit models of the negotiation process (Rubinstein 1982). The
Nash solution has previously been used in a wide range of applied contexts,
including the study of household decision-making (Kotlilcoff

and Spivak 1981,

Manser and Brown 1980, and McElroy and Homey 1981).
This franiework allows us to differentiate between the impact of

comparable worth on individual spouses. However, its

8

implementation requires

us to specify the parameter .*, and the threat points, U. Throughout our

analysis we assume that

—

1/2. Essentially, this implies that husbands and

wives are equally skilled at bargaining. It is doubtful that our results
(which concern the effects of policy changes)

are highly dependent upon the

value of a (which determines levels of well-being). On the other hand one
might argue that a would change in response to comparable worth policies- •as
women become more successEul in the labor market,

they may also become more

effective negotiators. By ignoring this possible effect, we may understate the
desirability of comparable worth to married women.

Conceptually spouses' threat points correspond to attainable utility
when negotiations are abandoned. It is natural to think of this outcome as
divorce. Household decisions, therefore, ought to depend both upon the

economic opportunities available to single individuals2 and upon the costs of
divorce. We identify two polar cases. In the first case, divorce is costless.
Spouses' threat points then correspond to the levels of economic well-being
which they could obtain as single individuals.

Marriage alters economic well-

being only to the extent it generates a surplus

(perhaps through economies of

scale in production): spouses bargain over the division of this surplus. In
the second case, divorce is prohibitively costly, possibly because of

emotional stress, loss of "marriage-specific

capital." and/or social stigma.

Economic status subsequent to marital dissolution is then of negligible

importance in determining the allocation of resources within a marriage.
The specification of threat points turns out to be a critical modeling
choice. When divorce is costless, a rise in women's wages necessarily benefits
married women, since their threat points improve. This remains true even if

men's wages fall simultaneously, as long as the economic surplus associated
with marriage does not shrink too much. However, when the costs of divorce are

prohibitive, a rise in women's wages may hurt married women and benefit
9

married men- Indeed, this paradoxical result is quite likely to hold when

women's wages rise and men's wages fall by roughly the same absolute amounts.
We illustrate this possibility in Figure 1. Suppose that the threat

points are always given by 4

—

— 0 (the consequences of divorce are

disastrous to both partners). Suppose further that, at initial wages, the

utility possibility frontier is P°. The pair (U, U), given by the tangency
of

with a rectangular hyperbola, represents the Nash bargaining solution.

Now suppose the woman's wage rises and the man's falls. Maximum attainable

utility for the man is higher than before (the woman works full time at a

higher wage to support his leisure); for the woman, it is smaller. Thus, the
utility possibility frontier rotates. If wage changes are such that it rotates
around the initial solution (to P1), then the new solution necessarily

involves higher utility for the man and lower utility for the woman.
Intuitively, this change raises the cost of

providing utility (through

leisure) to the woman and lowers the cost of

providing utility to the man. The

woman is worse off because she is compelled to increase her share of the
family's market work.

C.

Implementation

Some practical difficulties involved in the implementation of comparable
worth have been widely discussed (see, for example, Raisian, Ward, and Welch
1985). First among these is the determination of an appropriate index of
"Worth' from a large set of relevant factors,

including necessary

qualifications, responsibilities, working conditions, and flexibility of

hours. Second, there is the problem of

enforcement: a conglomerate might, for

example, circumvent a requirement that it pay truck drivers and textile

workers equally by divesting itself of either firm. We abstract from these
difficulties and assume that the standard of comparable worth under

consideration is precisely defined and enforceable. We do, however, examine
two other implementation issues, the first being the choice of a standard for
fair hiring practices.

Some such standard is clearly

necessary, since employers might otherwise

attempt to circumvent comparable worth by hiring men exclusively.
Discriminatory hiring practices are indeed prohibited under current laws; the

issue is how these laws will be interpreted
discrimination. While one could envision

to identify firms engaged in such

an enormous spectrum of possible

standards, we will focus on two standards which

seem particularly natural.

First, courts might Judge a firm in violation of the law if it hired men and
women in proportions which were significantly at variance with application
ratios. We will refer to this as the

applicant hiring rule. Second, courts

might prevent firms from lowering the fraction of women hired in each
occupation subsequent to adoption of the policy. We will refer to this as the
'historical hiring rule." We suspect that courts' interpretations of statutes

prohibiting discriminatory hiring practices will correspond more closely to

the applicant hiring rule, and therefore adopt it as part of our standard
case. We consider the results of the historical
illustrate that the effects of comparable

hiring rule primarily to

worth are extremely sensitive to

this aspect of implementation.

The second implementation issue we address is whether comparable worth
standards, if adopted, would apply to the entire economy, or some significant
subset of industries. Pressure for remedial

legislation might, for example, be

concentrated primarily in the government and manufacturing sectors. Indeed,
some states have already moved to adopt standards of

comparable worth for

government employees. It is therefore important to consider cases in which the
wage policy covers the entire economy ("full"

12

implementation), as well as

cases in which it applies to a limited number of sectors ("partial:'
implementation).

The potential importance of implementation issues can be illustrated by

examining efficiency effects within a simple partial equilibrium setting. In
Figure 2 we exhibit a standard supply and demand curve for some good, X, which
the reader may interpret as female labor. In the absence of government

intervention, the price of X equilibrates at
X'. Now suppose

that the

and agents trade the amount

government artificially imposes a price floor, Pf

(set equal to the comparable male wage). Since the short side of the market
ordinarily determines exchange, agents will trade the amount Xf. However,

suppliers will wish to sell X --

(X

-

Xf)

represents unemployment.

The deadweight loss associated with this policy depends on the allocation
of demand among suppliers. First suppose that the allocation is efficient, in

the sense that the lowest cost units are supplied first (e.g., because
suppliers can freely trade the rights to sell units of output). Deadweight
loss (DWL), which equals the sum of foregone consumer and producer surplus, is

given by the area of the shaded triangle. Simple algebra reveals that

p _p* 2

DVL i(

where 6D and

) (P*X*)C(l+c/c),

are the elasticities of demand and supply, respectively. This

formula bears a strong resemblance to the standard computation for excise
taxes. The first two terms are, of course, the square of the price markup, and
expenditures on I. In addition, note that DVI. rises with CD just as it does

for an excise tax. However, note that DWL falls with

, in

sharp contrast

with standard results on taxation. The intuition is, however, clear: since

suppliers are rationed, C does not affect Xf. A higher elasticity, therefore,
simply reduces the producer surplus associated with the foregone units.

Alternatively, if rationing is completely random (as it is in our
experiments), some higher-cost suppliers participate in the market. Assuming

for simplicity a linear supply curve with intercept P. the average cost of
production for selected suppliers increases to (Pf + P)/2. Thus, the
deadweight loss associated with inefficient rationing is given by the shaded
area in Figure 3. One should add this to our DWL measure, above.

From this simple analysis, we can draw two important lessons. First, any
factors which dampen the demand response may reduce the distortions associated

with comparable worth. Thus, hiring quotas may be a good second-best policy,
and quotas which lead to greater demand for women (such as the applicant

hiring rule) may be preferable. Likewise, it may be desirable to implement
comparable worth on an economy-wide basis rather than partially, in order to
reduce shifts of demand away from covered sectors. Second, note that the
elasticity of labor supply is high whenever there are other profitable ways of

employing

labor. Thus, in contrast to our last remark, partial implementation

may be preferable to full implementation, since uncovered sectors can absorb

displaced

workers; this argument is strengthened if the rationing is

inefficient.

In

the preceding discussion, we have implicitly assumed that purchasers

do not discriminate against X. If discrimination is present, then the true

marginal

social benefit (laB) of using X at any level of output

is greater

the price at which consumers would just be willing to purchase that level
of output. As shown in Figure 4, this increases the deadweight loss associated
than

with

imposing a price floor by an amount equal to the area of the shaded

rectangle. Thus, in

the

presence of discrimination, it

becomes

even more

important to impose quotas which require employers to maintain high
female employment.

Economists have long been aware that partial equilibrium analysis may be
very misleading (see Harberger's (1961] seminal analysis of the corporate income
tax). The reader may be struck by the similarity between a partial factor tax
and a price floor on one factor input, especially when this floor applies only
to employment in certain sectors. This analogy calls into question the

robustness of conclusions based on partial equilibrium analysis, and
underscores the importance of conducting general equilibrium simulations.

3. Model Description
To describe the implementation of our comparable worth experiments, we
turn to the specific structure and features of the model. This section details

the set of economic actors, the behavioral specifications, the alternative
assumptions concerning the initial wage gaps, and finally the meaning of
'labor market equilibrium" under

comparable worth.

A full technical

description of the behavioral specifications is given in Appendix A, and our
benchmark data set is provided in Appendix 5.

A. Elements of the Model
As with all other computable general equilibrium analyses, we employ a

aggregated framework. Our simplified U.S.

contains five
production sectors (each comprising one "representative' price-taking firm),
highly

economy

one government, and eight representative households. There are four job types:

'high-skill

male-dominated," "low-skill male-dominated," "high-skill female-

dominated," and "low-skill female-dominated." Each occupational category from

the 1979 Census is placed in one of these four aggregates according to the
majority sex of its workers and their median educational attainment (with 14

or more years of school used as the definition of "high-skill').3 Our job

18

definitions lead naturally to the specification of eight household types:
there are four representative married households, classified by the skill
levels of wife and husband, and four single types, defined by sex and skill

level. The five production sectors are agriculture, goods (including
manufacturing), trade and services, real estate, and government enterprises.

The inclusion of only four jobs, leading to just two wages under economywide comparable worth,4 is a simplification imposed by computational
requirements. More disaggregation of jobs would be desirable but it

is

not

clear a priori that the estimated effects of comparable worth on efficiency
are biased in a systematic direction. On the one hand, with a dichotomous
skill, level as the only dimension of "worth," the model overstates the extent

of the restrictions on wage rates. On the other hand, actual employers would
have more opportunities for substitution among the more numerous and narrowlydefined jobs, and it is these opportunities that produce efficiency losses to
the economy.

Additional production sectors would not be a major computational burden;
the motivation for parsimony here was data limitations. Given that the
relative sectoral effects were not our primary interest, we sought to avoid
increasing the number of required production function parameters. Preliminary
analysis with a 20-sector model suggested that the macro and gender-related
effects are probably not sensitive to the number of sectors.

The

transactions between economic agents are as follows. Household;

purchase the outputs of the five sectors, and provide
four

capital services and the

types of labor to these sectors plus government. The household objective

is to maximize the utility obtained from leisure and consumption. Producers
combine the factor supplies with intermediate inputs purchased from other
sectors, so as to maximize profits from the sale of output to other fins,

household

consumers, and the

government. Finally, the government produces
19

public services using labor and goods purchased with revenues from household

income taxes; the scenarios reported below are wequalyield experiments" in
which the marginal tax rates are adjusted so as to maintain constant real
government output.5

We turn next to the functional specifications that drive these
interactions.

B. Behavioral Specifications
The responses of firms and the government to changes in market
conditions are determined in accordance with their respective production
functions. As illustrated in Figure 5, we assume a nested-CES function for
value-added. In the innermost nests, composite high-skill and low-skill labor

result from the hours supplied in the respective male- and female-dominated
jobs. At the next level, these composite labor inputs are combined with
capital to produce high- and low-skill value-added. The final CES stage
aggregates these into value-added, which is then combined with intermediate
goods in fixed proportions. The figure shows the substitution elasticities
used in our standard case, and also the initial shares of "high-skill capital"
that we assume in calibrating each sector's production function.

We also use a CES specification for utility in unmarried households;
here, the CES function combines composite consumption and leisure, where
leisure" is defined as the difference between a maximum possible work week
and actual market work time. Composite consumption is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate
of the goods and services purchased from the five production sectors.7 Note
that each "representative' worker spends some hours in both the male- and
female-dominated jobs at his or her skill level; thus "leisure" must also be
some kind of composite that reflects the worker's preferences for allocating

time between the two jobs.8 We make two assumptions here: that the maximum
work week is divided between the two jobs in the same ratio as actual 1979
Census work hours for that type of worker;9 and that composite leisure is
again a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of leisure in each of the two jobs. Formally,

are included. Our standard case defines "household utility" as a

CES function of three terms- -household consumption, husband's leisure, and

wife's leisure (where each of these terms is again a composite). The merits
and limitations of this representation were discussed in the previous section.
In our alternative Nash-bargaining formulation, husbands and wives have
distinct single-worker type utility functions, and agree to maximize the
product of their benefits from marriage. As a crude representation of the
various sources of benefits (e.g., economies of scale, love, children, etc.),
we include a single utility bonus factor "g" (>1), which increases the utility
of any combination of own consumption and leisure by a fixed percentage. The
spouses' threat points (or bargaining positions) are determined by the utility
they would attain if single, scaled by a term "T" (<1) representing the
psychic and/or financial costs of divorce. Using "U" to represent the utility
levels within the marriage, "V" to indicate the maximum attainable utility if
single, and 'h" and "W" subscripts for husband and wife, the formal problem is
to maximize

to the household budget constraint.

The substitution elasticities used in the household utility functions are
derived from estimates of labor supply elasticities. The supply assumptions
and resulting substitution elasticities for our standard case are given in
Table I. The income elasticity of labor supply is directly determined by the
maximum work week parameter; in the standard set, we use 60 hours/week for
everyone, with implied income elasticities as shown in the table. Table 2

C. Wage Gap Assumptions
According

to Census data, women's wages in the four jobs are 18 percent

to 39 percent below men's wages;11 we assume that employers consider the sexes

perfect

substitutes in each job at the given wages)2 As discussed above,

these differentials can be explained in various ways; the model takes an
agnostic position, allowing any fraction of the within-Job gaps to be
attributed to Beckerian discriminatory preferences by employers,'3 with the
remainder specified as due to productivity differences between men and women.
Of course, the source of the wage gaps between the male- and female-dominated
Jobs plays a major role in the comparable worth controversy. Here, the model
is less flexible; we assume that these differences are solely the result of
the balance between profit-maximizing demands and utility-maximizing supplies.
If

anything, this assumption understates

worth: whatever the source of

the efficiency costs of comparable

the inter-Job gaps, employers will shift away

from the female-dominated jobs when their relative wages rise, and this shift
will have a greater output cost the more productive those workers are (i.e.,
the more the gaps are due to discrimination).14
The model also allows experiments in which initial efficiency gaps and/or
discrimination coefficients disappear subsequent to the enactment of
comparable worth. As explained above, such scenarios correspond to some recent
theories of wage differentials. For productivity increases, the further
question arises of whether these gains are at all costly to women workers
(e.g.,

take

in terms of reduced energy available for nonmarket pursuits). Again, we
an agnostic position: any perceived cost between 0 and 100 percent of

the efficiency gain is allowed in the model.

D.

Constrained Equilibrium under Comparable Worth

Both within-job and between-job wage gaps are eliminated by the

comparable worth wage rule, which specifies that all women and men of the same

skill level be paid the same wage.15 Given our assumption that the sexes are
considered perfect substitutes at the initial within-job differentials,
employers will prefer to hire men at any unisex wages. As noted in the last
section, we impose one of two hiring constraints to represent existing equalopportunity statutes: in the historical hiring rule, employers must continue
to employ female and male labor in each of the four jobs in the same
proportions as they did before comparable worth; under the applicant
proportions rule, women and men must be hired in the ratios by which they come
seeking employment. Without some such hiring rule to prevent employers from
exchanging wage gaps for employment discrimination, the model would find a
very high-wage equilibrium in which the demand for labor was reduced to a
level that could be supplied by men alone.

25

Although firms are thus constrained in their responses within each job,
neither hiring rule affects their ability to substitute away from the femaledominated jobs, at a time when those jobs are becoming more attractive to
workers;16 thus neither rule produces full equilibrium in the labor market.

The form of the imbalance may not be immediately clear: are wages high with
some female-job aspirants unable to find desired employment, or do low wages

prevent firms from finding enough male-job workers? The answer is the former;
nothing prevents employers from raising wages to attract enough labor of any
type, but an underemployed female-job worker has no comparable ability to bid
the wage down,

since

firms must pay the same in both jobs and a below-market

wage would cause them to lose all their male-job workers.

Therefore, both men and women will face employment constraints in the
female jobs, under either hiring rule, With the applicant proportions rule.

both sexes will face the same percentage constraint in these jobs, and both
will be fully employed (i.e., face no constraint) in the male jobs, by
construction. Under the historical rule, supply and demand sex-ratios will not

coincide, and thus one sex (almost certainty women) will be constrained in the
male jobs as well.

A worker facing a binding constraint on market hours in one job will
compensate according to his or her utility function- - in part by working more

in the other job at that skill level (unless a binding constraint exists there
as well), and in part by accepting more-than-desired leisure, (Married

couples may also substitute more spousal work time.) Note that the model
imposes the same constraints on all workers, rather than identifying some as
completely unemployed under comparable worth, and others as able to work as

many hours as desired.17 We feel this is a reasonable representation, given
the trend toward shorter work weeks (prompted in part by the decline of full-

26

time homemakers, who can be expected to become even rarer under comparable
worth).

The preceding describes the model implementation of economy-wide

comparable worth; however, the model also allows "partial coverage"
experiments in which the wage restrictions apply only to a subset of
employment sectors. When there are covered and uncovered sectors, we model the
rationing of the covered sector employment by a lottery; each worker is either

a 'winner or a "loser" in each of his or her two jobs, and calculates desired
hours accordingly. This all-or-nothing approach differs, but perhaps not
unrealistically,

from our treatment of

that with enough

Note

of

unemployment under universal coverage.

the economy not covered, no unemployment

occurs: the

lottery percentages adjust to clear the covered labor markets, and the
uncovered-sector wages adjust freely to clear the others.

In sunary. a complete specification of an experiment with this model
involves the selection of the wage rule (see footnote 15), hiring rule,

efficiency/discrimination proportions in the intra-job wage gaps, continuation
or disappearance of these two pay factors, utility formulation for couples,

and sectors covered. In each case, the model solves for the wages, capital
rental rate, equal-yield tax rate multiplier, and the relevant employment
constraints.

Among

the modelts more important limitations is the absence of dynamics;

we do

not study the transition costs to the comparable worth equilibrium. The

model

also ignores possible effects on fertility or investment in physical or

human capital;

social and political changes that might result from comparable

are also largely outside the

4. Results
As is typical in research with computable general equilibrium models, we
calibrate our model to reproduce exactly a benchmark data set, and report the
counterfactual simulation results as changes from this base equilibrium.
Before proceeding to the results, it may be useful to take a brief look at the
benchmark labor market.

The first panel of Table 3 shows that slightly less than one-fourth of
employment hours are worked in jobs which we classify as high-skill, and that
the ratio at female to male wages in a particular job category ranges from 60

percent to 82 percent. Women get the lowest relative wage in the male
dominated high-skill category. The second panel in the table shows the
allocation of labor across sectors and the degree to which the labor force in

each sector is male or female. "Trade and ServiceC and "Goods" each account
for roughly 40 percent of total employment in the economy. Almost half of work
hours in Trade and Services are performed by women, but the fraction is only
one

quarter in the Goods sector. Employment in the

sector

is

"General Governmenr

even more female intensive than in Trade and Services, with women's

hours accounting for S2 percent of the total. The third panel shows that

married women work slightly more total hours than single women, whereas
married men provide a much greater share of total hours than do single men.
Tables 4 through 10 display the results for four sets of different
specifications of the model and of comparable worth policy. Each set comprises
two experiments: one in which the existing wage differentials within jobs are

due to differences in productivity, and one where they are due to
discrimination. (We have computed intermediate cases where the wage
differential is due to some of each and the results closely approximate a

linear combination of the two extreme cases shown here.) Table 4 contains the

macro or aggregate results for percentage change in CNP and total work hours
and the change in a measure of economic efficiency, while Tables S through 10
contain the microeconomic impacts in terms of employment, welfare, and output.
Since it is difficult to explain the aggregate results without reference to
the underlying allocational changes, we discuss these tables as a group rather
than examining them sequentially. Our measure of efficiency is the traditional
sum across households of Hicksian equivalent variations, expressed as a
percentage of base CNP. This measure is strictly appropriate for a Benthamite
social welfare function and is the construction universally used to measure
costs in cost-benefit analyses.
As an arbitrarily chosen "standard case," we consider full (economy-wide)
comparable worth, accompanied by a rule that hiring must be proportional to
applicants, and with family behavior governed by a single utility function.
Table 4 indicates that the macro effects of such a policy depend considerably

on the cause of the existing wage differentials. Considering first the case
in which they are due to efficiency differences, GNP and total work hours are

predicted to fall by 3.5 percent and economic efficiency is found to decrease
by almost two percent of CNP. Besides the direct deadweight cost illustrated
in Figure 3, the loss in economic efficiency is increased by the tax wedge
between the value of leisure and the social marginal productivity of work;
with this tax wedge, any policy which reduces the market labor usage will tend
to lead to a welfare loss.

The changes in GNP and economic efficiency calculated for the standard
case with efficiency differences are large relative to the corresponding
figures for other policies that have been explored with this type of model.
For example, Harberger (1966) and Fullerton, King, Shoven, and Whalley (1981)

find that the efficiency cost of the double taxation of corporate equity

income (at both the corporate and personal levels) is roughly between half and

one percent of GNP. Here, the efficiency cost figure is at least double that.
It should be pointed out that the loss in economic efficiency in this case is
not 1.96 percent of one year's GNP, but is equivalent to the annual loss of
that percent of the value of output- -i.e., a loss of roughly two percent of
the

total human and nonhuman capital in the economy.

If

the wage gaps are due to discrimination,

the CNP loss incurred with

the introduction of comparable worth in our standard case is 1.5 percent and
the loss in economic efficiency is just .24 percent. To understand why the

macro results are so different, one must refer to Table S which shows that in
both cases the composition of the labor force is significantly altered by
comparable worth: women's labor supply increases roughly S to 11 percent and

men's decreases about 10.5 percent. If women are as productive as men, as in
the case where the wage gaps are due to discrimination, this substitution of
women for men in the work force does not reduce GNP and efficiency as it

would

if the initial gaps were due to efficiency differences.

One

might

significant

the

wonder why the discrimination gaps case does not show a

increase in economic efficiency. The answer is that eliminating

discriminatory wage differentials does not nullify the employers' taste

for discrimination. Firms now consider women more costly than men, and while
they must obey the hiring rule in employing the sexes within each lob, nothing
prevents a demand shift away from those Jobs and sectors that are female-

intensive.'8 (This is equally true in the efficiency gaps cases.) Thus, the
perception

of a wage "gap" is not eliminated, but transferred from the supply

side to the demand side; under the assumptions of our standard case, this
leaves

economic welfare largely unaffected.

The expected patterns of employment changes are found in the micro
tables. Table 6 shows that the employment of both men and women declines in

the female dominated jobs in the standard case. Table 10 shows that the

output of the Trade and Services sector, whose employees are almost half
women, declines by the Largest amount, significantly more than the other large
employment sector, the Goods sector. A result of the comparable worth wages
and the accompanying hiring rules is that single women, who desire to work
more at their newly higher wages, actually end up working less. They are

crowded out of employment by the very large increase in desired employment by
married women. In the standard cases, single women end up supplying 11 to 13
percent less labor <Table 5), although they would like to work about 25
percent more hours than are made available by employers (Table 7).

Focusing further on the effects of the employment constraints, we now
examine the results under the rule that hiring must be done in historical sex
ratios. Table 4 shows that the loss in GNP, work hours, and economic efficien-

cy would be significantly, and in most cases dramatically, larger than if an
applicant rule were applied, under either explanation of the existing wage
differentials. With historical hiring proportions, the labor demand for women
is much lower. As before, the sectors and jobs which heavily utilize women's
labor are those which shrink due to the increased cost of female labor.
However, in this case women cannot increase their share of the work in other
jobs, and therefore they are trapped in declining jobs and sectors and suffer
significant
the

gender

unemployment The later tables clarify

this. Table 5

shows that

composition of the labor force is quite different with the histori-

cal ratio hiring rule. Both men and women work less with comparable worth
under this regime, with the hours of single women now down about 20 percent.
The toss in GNP is particularly great in the discrimination gaps case relative
to what it would be with an applicant rule, because the many women who are
unemployed in this case are as productive as their male counterparts.

39

Tables 6 through 8 further elaborate the differences between the results

with an applicant hiring rule and a historical hiring rule. The first rows of
Table 6 show a large shift of women between female-dominated jobs and male
dominated jobs. For example, in the standard case with existing wage
differentials due to discrimination, female hours in the low-skill femaledominated jobs decline by 10 percent while female hours in the male-dominated
low skill jobs increase by almost 60 percent. With the historical hiring rule,
this large increase in female employment in the low skill male dominated jobs
is missing. Tables 7 and 8 show employment relative to desired employment by
sex and marital, status and also by job. Desired employment is the amount

someone would choose to work if there were no constraints on that person or,

in the case of married individuals, on the spouse. Table 7 shows that men
actually work more than they would if the comparable worth wages were not
accompanied by employment constraints; this is accounted for by married men,

who try to compensate for the restrictions that prevent their wives from
working as much as desired. This is particularly striking in the cases with
the historical hiring rule, where Table 7 indicates that married women work
only slightly more than 50 percent of their intended hours, and married men
work almost 112 percent of their desired hours. Table 8 shows that women move
from constrained to unconstrained jobs in the applicant hiring rule case, but

that

effectively all jobs are constrained for them in the historical hiring

rule. 19

We conclude that as a hiring regulation to accompany a comparable
wage

worth

policy, the historical hiring rule is sharply inferior to the applicant

rule. This was evident in the aggregate results of Table 4 and also shows up
in the disaggregated welfare results of Table 9. Regardless of whether the

existing differentials are due to discrimination or efficiency differences,
all married couples are better off with an applicant rule than with a

40

historical hiring rule, as are high-skill single women. Single men and lowskill single women lose somewhat less with the historical hiring rule under

the efficiency gaps assumption although even they would prefer the applicant
rule under the discrimination gaps hypothesis. The reason that single men may
do better under the historical rule is that they are protected from increasing
competition from women in the male dominated jobs. Low-skill single women seek
fewer work hours than their married counterparts, and thus are relatively less
restricted by the absolute hour limits used with the historical hiring rule

than by the proportional limits of the standard cases (see note 17). This
less-burdensome constraint in the female job can be enough to compensate them
for the restriction on hours in the male Job.
Still concentrating on the specific welfare effects under the two

alternative hiring rules, one major result in Table 9 is that only single
women are made

better

off with comparable worth. The magnitude of the changes

in welfare are considerable. With the applicant hiring rule, comparable worth
legislation increases the welfare of single women from 4.7 to 6.4 percent
while

decreasing the welfare of single men roughly 4 to 8 percent. Married

couples

are almost always made worse

off because the improvement in the wife's

wage fails to overcome the deterioration of the husband's work situation.
Another notable feature of Table 9 is that high-skilled men, whether
married or single, do much worse than low-skilled men, under either hiring

rule. The same holds, less strongly, for single women.

This

is largely the

result of our elasticity assumptions: we allow employers to shift from the
female- to the male-dominated job more easily at the low-skill level than at

the high-skill level (i.e., a5

>

in

Figure 5); and we assume lower labor

supply elasticities, hence less ability to substitute consumption for highercost leisure, for high-skill workers (see Table 1). This explanation is
41

confirmed by a simulation not reported in the tables, in which these elasticity
assumptions were reversed in the standard efficiency differentials case; these
changes cut the high/low welfare effects gap to .3 percent for single men, and
more than reversed the single women's gap, with the high-skilled workers
benefiting 1.5 percent more than the low-skilled. (The welfare effects for
single men (and married couples) are not more completely reversed in this
experiment because switching the assumed labor supply elasticities is not

equivalent to switching the model's consumption/leisure substitution
elasticities: other variables from the base data set, such as capital income
and hours worked, influence the derived substitution elasticities.)

We also examine in Tables 4 through 10 a case where comparable worth wage
equality is enforced only in the Goods sector and in Government Enterprises
and General Government. The aggregate results of Table 4 show that the

efficiency loss almost equals the percentage decline in GNP for this case, in

sharp contrast to the results of the other cases. The reason for this is that
partial coverage opens a new sort of intersectoral inefficiency, namely that
the wage costs differ between the covered and uncovered sectors. The strong
output effects of this are shown in Table 10 where the Trade and Services
sector, which is both labor intensive and female labor intensive, now grows
rather than shrinks. Because there is an uncovered sector to absorb all those
who want to work (at the relatively low wages which prevail there), aggregate
employment falls very little in this case. Technically, then, there is no
unemployment with partial coverage.
Recall that our formulation of the partial coverage cases allows those
who get covered jobs to work as many hours as they choose, but rations access
to these jobs. The resulting specific welfare effects are shown on the third

set of rows in Table 9, with standard deviations given in parentheses. For
instance, for the efficiency gaps assumption, high-skill single women on

42

average gain 3.46 percent, but one standard deviation adds or subtracts 4.96
percentage points to that figure. Women who are unable to find any covered

sector

employtnent are unambiguously worse off than if no comparable worth

policy existed.

The final case covered in the set of Tables 4 through 10 is not a variant
of our model of comparable worth, but rather an alternative model of the
family. Here we adopt the approach described above in which Nash bargaining
determines the division of resources in marriages. In the cases shown in this
set of tables, we assume the gains from marriage (perhaps due to economies of
scale in consumption) are 20 percent. In this Nash bargaining framework we are
able to examine the welfare consequences for husbands and wives separately.

The aggregate results of Table 4 are not too different in the Nash
bargaining case from those in the standard case, although under the efficiency

gaps assumption the percentage declines in ON? and aggregate welfare are now
noticeably smaller. This is because the composition of employment is very
different with Nash bargaining, as is evident in Table 5. Because of the
bargaining arrangement, much less substitution of women's work for men's work
takes place among marrieds. Overall, the labor force is more male intensive

with the Nash bargaining model, and since men are more productive in the
efficiency gaps case, GN? and total efficiency fall less. The specific welfare

results of Table 9 show separate compensating variation figures for husbands
and wives for the household bargaining mode].. In these cases, husbands lose

and wives gain. In fact, husbands lose more than single men of the same skill
level; this is because their threat points have weakened in their marriages
relative to those of their wives.

In any simulation model, the results are a function of assumptions and
parameters.

number

This particular model is relatively complex

and involves a large

of assumptions, prohibiting systematic sensitivity analysis. Nonethe43

less we have examined the results of some alternative parameter values, and
present the results in Tables 11 and 12. Two variants of the standard case
with efficiency gaps are presented, one which raises the total hours to be
allocated between work and leisure from 60 hours a week to 70 hours per week
(with other parameters recalibrated so that the model still replicates the
benchmark data in the base case), and the other triples the intra-skill

elasticities of substitution (04 and G). Changing the total amount of time to
be allocated affects the qualitative results of comparable worth not at all

and the quantitative results only slightly. Tripling the substitution
elasticities is a rather more drastic change in assumptions and hence causes

some important qualitative changes in the results. Fins can now substitute
male dominated jobs for female dominated ones much more readily, with the
result that women are much more constrained in the amount of work offered them
after comparable worth is implemented. Total work hours by women now decline,
total work hours in the economy fall by over 7 percent and the decline in GNP
and economic efficiency is correspondingly higher than in the standard case.
Interestingly. Table 12 indicates that all households are worse off with the
higher substitution elasticities, with the exception that low-skill single
men are slightly better off. Of course, the high elasticities simply allow a
wedge to cause greater distortions in the economy, as was described above.

We also increased elasicities (in this case the labor supply elasticities
and all substitution elasticities in the Goods and trade and Services sectors)
in the standard case under the discrimination gaps hypothesis. Again, the

higher elasticities lead to larger welfare losses and a greater reduction in
labor market hours and GNP. The partial equilibrium analysis of section 2

predicted the opposite welfare result for the supply elasticities case;
however, that analysis took as given the wage floor Pf. Here, the greater
supply sensitivity means a greater increase in the share of women in the

work force, and hence a higher average wage perceived by employers. The
qualitative result that the efficiency cost of comparable worth is much
smaller if the existing differentials are due to discrimination remains, with
the efficiency loss numbers remaining under one percent of CS? even in these
cases with increased elasticities.

We have done two sensitivity analyses for the Nash bargaining cases. In
the first of these, we set the threat points to zero for married couples in a
case where the existing differentials are due to efficiency differences.20

This effectively locks both spouses into the marriage and causes them to
engage in the same type of female for male labor substitution that is observed
with the model with family utility functions. In particular, Case 3A of Table
1.1 shows that married women work 14 percent more and married men 6.6 percent

less after comparable worth. This substitution was not apparent in the base
case where threat points were equal to a spouse's utility if single (i.e.,

with costless divorce). The most noticeable change caused by the removal of
threat points (which is analytically equivalent to an infinite marriage bonus)
is in the distribution of welfare within marriages. These figures are shown in

Table 12. With a 20 percent marriage bonus, wives gain and husbands lose due

to comparable worth; the womens gain arises from the strengthening of their
threat points. With zero threat points, the women work more and therefore
enjoy less leisure, while the husbands share in the income generated by the
wives. In fact, the husbands in some cases end up significantly better off
while all wives are worse off because of comparable worth. The second of the
Nash bargaining sensitivity cases increases the marriage bonus or the degree
of returns to scale in marriage from 20 percent to 50 percent, in a case where
the existing wage differentials are due to discrimination. This change barely
affects the aggregate results, although the labor substitution and the welfare
transfers noted above are also apparent for this case.

47

In addition to the above experiments with various comparable worth

specifications and parameter choices, we have conducted a third group of
simulations in which the discrimination or effiency differences that produce
male/female wage gaps in each job evaporate. We summarize the macroeconomic

results here but omit the detailed tables, partly for brevity and partly
because we don't feel that our model adequately captures the complexities of
the labor market theories that predict this elimination.

Because discriminatory preferences affect the efficiency of resource use
at

the margin, while productivity gaps affect the value of all infra-marginal

resources, the disappearance of the former should provide smaller gains than
the elimination of the latter. The model confirms this: if pre-existing

discrimination evaporates under comparable worth,
overall

GNP rises 2.2 percent and

economic efficiency is boosted 1.6 percent of original 01W; for

vanishing productivity differences, the corresponding gains are 5.3 percent
and 7.5 percent. Even here, of course, the equality of wages between male- and
female-dominated jobs imposed by comparable worth is inefficient; if
discrimination or productivity gaps could be eliminated without comparable

worth, the gain in economic efficiency would be 3.6 percent or 9.7 percent.

respectively. (These latter figures are our model's estimates of the welfare
costs of the intra-job wage differentials, under the two alternative
concerning their origin.)
We also considered cases in which productivity differences evaporate, but

assumptions

at some cost to women workers throuzjt increased schooling, acceptance of lesspreferred careers, a reduction in ener available for non-market activities,
or the like. If women bear the full cost, then eliminating the productivity
gaps leads to no change in economic welfare; in a smaller number of hours,
women can produce as much as they did before for exactly the sane total pay
48

and at precisely the same disutility cost from working. If comparable worth
is added to this situation, an efficiency loss of 1.0 percent is observed.

results

These

are somewhat non-linear with respect to the "effort cost"

assumption; for example, to equate the welfare change under the assumption
that women bear a cost of 90 percent of the productivity improvement with a

weighted average of the "full cost" and "zero cost" results, respective
weights of about 93.5 percent and 6.5 percent are required.

S.

Discussion
The simulations reported in this paper reveal that both the implementa-

tion of comparable worth and the analysis of its effects are extremely complex.

The results are very sensitive to assumptions about the hiring rules

that will

accompany the wage constraints and the source of existing male-

female wage differentials, the modeling of married households, and a number of
behavioral parameters.

Consider the issue of hiring rules. Regardless of whether existing wage
gaps are due to efficiency differences or to discrimination, the introduction
of comparable worth on a large scale will cause employers to want to substi-

tute away from women workers toward men. Thus some constraints on hiring are
likely to be imposed. If, after implementation of comparable worth, employers

are required to maintain the same sex ratio of employees as before the new

policy

(historical proportions),

the

adverse

effects of the policy on employ-

ment, gross national product, and economic efficiency will be much greater
than if firms are required to employ men and women in the same proportion as
they appear in the pool of qualified applicants (applicant proportions).
Marital status and the assumptions about the nature of marriage are very
important. The effects of comparable worth on employment, income, and utility
of single men and women are relatively easy to discern: single women are big

49

winners, although their employment falls. Single men are unambiguously big
losers. The effects on married men and women, by contrast, are not easy to

predict. They vary greatly depending on whether married couples are assumed to
have a single utility function or to engage in bargaining. If the latter, the
results are additionally sensitive to the ease or difficulty of divorce and
the size of the gains from marriage.
If existing wage gaps between men and women reflect efficiency

differences, comparable worth would have substantial adverse effects on
the economy as a whole, although women as a group might benefit, and single
women almost certainly would benefit under a variety of assumptions, If the
wage gaps are entirely attributable to discrimination, comparable worth would
have smaller effects on GNP. total employment and, particularly, aggregate
welfare. The simulation results based on assumptions of zero discrimination or
100 percent discrimination can be regarded as providing upper and lower bounds
of the effects of comparable worth within the limits of the model.
As might be expected, if comparable worth is introduced in only part of
the economy (partial coverage), the effects in most respects are attenuated;

however, if the wage gap is the result of discrimination, the efficiency
losses are greater than they would be with full coverage. Also in line with
expectations, the efficiency losses increase if employers' elasticities of
substitution are larger.

Regardless of assumptions, the redistributive effects of comparable worth
are likely to be substantial. Not only are men and women affected very differently, but there is an interaction between sex and marital status, and sex and
skill level. Those who oppose comparable worth because they expect it to have
adverse effects on aggregate economic well-being will find some support in
these results, but those who favor comparable worth because of its redistribu-

tive effects will also find support.

and more

and firms. Whether a more finely tuned comparable worth

imposed on a mare disaggregated model would result in larger or

smaller changes in CUP and economic efficiency is not clear a priori. The

policy rule in our model, complete equality in pay between men and women
(in the two types of jobs) is clearly an extreme version, and to that
extent

exaggerates the impact of comparable worth. On the other hand, our

highly aggregated model understates the extent to which individual fins
and industries could react to comparable worth by reorganizing production

and substituting male for female labor. This reorganization and substitution
tends

to increase the efficiency losses. It is clear that greater disaggrega-

tion would tend to reduce the redistributive effects of comparable worth.
Second, a more detailed model, should consider the effects of evasion

(perhaps analogous to partial coverage), as welt as the costs of enforcement
designed to reduce evasion. In addition to outright defiance of the law

(especially by small fins where enforcement would be extremely expensive),

employers

could resort to greater reliance on 'temporary" labor, more

purchased inputs, and similar restructuring that would tend to distort the
effect of the comparable worth policy. These "quasi-legal' evasions would
reduce the redistributive impact of comparable worth and probably increase its
adverse

effect on efficiency.

Third,

it

would be useful to analyze the

transition

to comparable

worth.

Wage parity between women and men requires a steep rise in women's wages or a

steep fall in men's. The foner is likely to be more politically feasible;

FOOTNOTES

I.

Note that there is a striking similarity between implementing

comparable worth in some subset of economic sectors, and imposing a partial
factor tax on capital in the corporate sector (i.e., a corporate income tax).

Previous studies of the corporate income tax have not only revealed the
importance of general equilibrium effects (see Harberger 1961), but have also
demonstrated the

value

of modeling the economy in detail, and employing

computational techniques (see Fullerton. King, Shoven, and Whalley 1981). If
anything, the effects of comparable worth are more complex. For example, while
the interpretation of a tax wedge is unambiguous, one must consider several

possible sources for male-female pay differentials.
2.

Ideally, the opportunities available after divorce should include

the possibility of remarriage. Such "marriage market interactions are not
considered in the present model, but are the subject of current study by the
first author.

3. other data sources include the 1977 Input-Output tables, the 1977
IRS tax tables, and the 1972-73 Consumer Expenditure Survey of the Department
of Labor. More recent CES data are now available, but our sectoral classifica-

tion is broad enough that updating the expenditure shares is unimportant.
4.

any

We recognize that comparable worth would leave each firm free to

use

conception of worth that could be shown not to be sex-biased; we assume

within-skill-level wage equality across all employers covered by comparable
worth simply as a consequence of long-run competition.

5. To accommodate the Input-Output data, we also have a rudimentary

foreign sector: U.S.

imports

in the five production sectors and net capital
53

exports are both fixed in quantity terms, and U.S. goods exports adjust (in a
given Cobb-Douglas pattern) to maintain aggregate balance.
6.

Since econometric estimates of the precise parameters we need are

generally unavailable, we have had to rely heavily on our own best guesses.

The only recourse in such a situation is to conduct sensitivity tests, some of
which are reported below. The government is assumed not to use any capital.

This assumption was chosen due to a lack of available data on government
capital ownership and use, and because it was not felt that the specification
of the government production function had a central impact on our results.

7. Government spending does not enter explicitly into utility. Since
our experiments hold the size of government fixed, this simplification has no
effect on our conclusions. More generally, one could justify our approach by
assuming that utility is separable in privately and governmentally provided
goods.

8. Alternatively, we could have subdivided the households by the job as

well

as

skill type of each worker. In this case, the model would require a

description of the willingness of people to transfer from one job (and hence
household category) to another, depending on wage and unemployment rates.
9.

One should not interpret this assumption literally. It reflects an

abstract restriction on our functional specification, which generates
plausible behavioral responses. As discussed in the next section, our results
are not sensitive to the assumed length of the maximum work week.

10. Although the model does have separate g and t parameters, it can be
seen from the Nash formula that only their ratio has any significance.

11. In the original data, the average wage paid to a worker of a given
sex and job differs by employment sector. A number of factors may help explain
this, ranging from compensating worker preferences to disequilibrium in the
labor market, and almost certainly including differences by sector in the

54

composition of our four aggregate wjobs._ We assume that the initial data do
reflect an equilibrium; and rather than define a vector to represent worker
tastes or employer requirements, we apply the economy-wide average wage to
each sector, and adjust the number of hours accordingly. In the latter case of
different equality mixes in different sectors, these adjusted figures can be
thought of as the efficiency hours demanded in each sector.

12. This assumption follows naturally from the assertion that men and

are performing the same job. Of course, the jobs are only the same at

women

the model's level of aggregation, since the sexes are distributed differently
among the many occupations within each of our four jobs. The model does
include imperfect substitutability between work hours in male- and female-

dominated jobs; again, a more disaggregated model would be able to better
approximate the correct substitution possibilities, but at high costs in
computer time and presentational complexity.

13. More precisely, since there is no identifiable class of business
managers in the model, we represent discrimination by capitalists, with the
discrimination income distributed to households in proportion to their
ownership of physical capital.

14. This conclusion needn't hold if comparable worth would eliminate the
propensity to discriminate against female jobs, but not affect existing
efficiency differences.

15. Two alternative wage rules of lesser interest are available: wages
can be equalized within each of the four jobs, but

not

across jobs in a skill

category; and wages within a skill, category can be equalized separately for
the two sexes.

16. High-skill women are an exception; since they are initially paid
slightly more in the female-dominated job (see Table 3), comparable worth

55

makes that job sl.ightly less attractive to them in relative terms. However,

the higher real wages increase these women's desired employment in both jobs.

Note that an absolute hour constraint (e.g.. 18.3 hours/week) may be
binding on workers from one household type but not others. This is the type of
17.

constraint used with the historical hiring rule. Because of the 'equal

proportions" nature of the applicant hiring rule, it is more natural to
formulate

those constraints

in percentage terms (e.g., 83 percent of desired

hours);

clearly, this type is simultaneously binding on all workers. (The

obvious

strategic behavior is not allowed.)

18.

Under the applicant hiring rule, the female- or male-intensity of a

sector depends on where the sexes choose to apply for work. For a given job,

we assume that women and men distribute their applications in such a way as to
increase (or decrease) the ratio of female to male hours worked by the same
percentage in each sector; i.e., we assume that the relative pattern of the
sectors' female-intensities will tend to persist under comparable worth.

19. In the first two rows of Table 8. the figures for the two femaledominated jobs are the same for men and women; this is no coincidence, but a

direct result of the applicant hiring rule used in the standard cases. This
equality does not obtain under the historical hiring rule.

Although the Nash bargaining experiments reported at the bottom of the
table use the applicant proportions rule, women work a slightly smaller
fraction of their desired hours than do men in the constrained jobs: the
explanation is that in these experiments, "desired employment hours" are not

identical with the requests for work actually presented to employers. Desired
hours are calculated at the hypothetical resource allocation that would occur
if there were no employment constraints, whereas applications seen by fins
depend on the actual income division between husbands and wives, taking the
constraints into account. Since the employment rationing in female-dominated

56

jobs is more costly to wives, the Nash bargaining process partially compensates
for this by increasing their share of household resources over what it would
be with no constraints; this lowers the female labor supply seen by firms, who
continue to accept equal proportions of actual labor applications from women
and men.

20. We are unable to report an aggregate efficiency cost of comparable
worth in this case. Recall that our efficiency measure in the sum of Hicksian
equaivalent variations- -

i.e.,

the negative of the sum of the payments required

to make each individual as well off as before comparable worth. In the other
Nash bargaining experiments, it Is possible to bring both marital partners
back to their original utility levels by a suitable combination of payments to
(or from) each spouse; these payments affect not only the aggregate income of
the houshehold, but also the relative bargaining positions of the spouses.

However, in the "no divorce' case, the outside prospects of the husband and
wife are Irrelevant to the household bargaining, and giving more income to one
spouse or the other is equivalent to simply adding income to "the household.'
In general, and in our comparable worth experiment in particular, there is no

change in household income that will simultaneously restore the base utility
levels of both partners.

Technical Specification of Agents' Economic Behavior

1. Firms
Intra—industry competition ensures that production takes place only at
the cost—minimizing point along the efficient production frontier, given the

prevailing wages and capital rental rate. Thus the representative firm sees
its output price P and value—added price PVA as determined by the industry cost
function, and chooses inputs of male and female labor (M and F) and of capital
for high—skill and low—skill workers (1(14 and 1(L) to attain this least—cost

solution while satisfying product demand. Let job subscripts 1 and 2 refer to
the male— and female—dominated jobs, with 3 and 4 denoting the male and female
low—skill jobs; and let LH and LL refer to composite high— and low—skill labor,

respectively. Then the problem for sector i (i—l,5) can be stated as

mechanism, in experiments without comparable worth, and on the uncovered

sectors in the partial coverage cases. In the latter cases, the labor supply
figures in the V formula distinguish between workers in the covered and
uncovered labor markets; also, the wage rates differ by sector, but sectoral

subscripts are omitted here for clarity. The discrimination wages 5. are held
roughly constant in real terms by indexing them to the male wage in job 1:

other producers. Imports are fixed in reat terms; foreigners spend a part of
their dollar receipts on a fixed quantity of U.S. capital service exports,
and the rest on sectoral outputs in fixed (i.e., Cobb—Douglas) value shares.
Demand by the government and each household type is also allocated in fixed
value shares, and intermediate products are required in the same real proportions

as in the base input—output data. The output prices to which demands respond
are determined by the CES cost functions for value—added, augmented by the
costs of intermediate inputs.

3. Households
Households seek to maximize utility, which is a CES function of consumption

and leisure; these in turn are bath Cobb—Douglas aggregates. There are four
types of married households, defined by the skill levels of husband and wife,

and four types of single households, classified by sex and skill level. For
convenience, let s index the household's four (two, for singles) work
possibilities; the household type h determines the market job to which a given
$

corresponds.

(For example, by numbering convention, h3 refers to married

couples with a low—skilled husband and high—skilled wife, and s4 indicates
the wife's work in her female—dominated job; thus the household wage
corresponds to WF2——women's wage in the female high—skill jab——in the previous

notation.) Let

Th. L and

66

In comparable worth experiments, the values of t1

and t2 used

for single

women's households (h=7,8) are not those from the base data set. Since this
wage policy would tend to move single women into the same tax brackets as
single men of the same skill level, in these experiments we apply the men's
base tax rates as the starting points for single households of both sexes.
Regrettably, the tax rates in the partial coverage experiments are not specific

to each worker's luck in the covered—sector employment "lottery." LMAXh
(i.e., there are no binding constraints) in experiments without comparable

worth, and in those with partial coverage. In the latter, access Co employ—
ment in the high—wage sectors is rationed by the eight lottery ratios, which
adjust

each

to match the cemand for

workers in

each job/sex combination; thus,

household type is divided into sub—types (16 for married couples, 4 for

singles)

with different combinations of covered and uncovered wages in the

budget constraint.
With full coverage of comparable worth, UIAXh depends on the hiring rule.
Under the applicant hiring rule, neither sex faces any constraints in the
male—dominated jobs (s—I or 3); in each of the two female jobs, all workers
are allowed to work the same fraction of hours they would have chosen in the
absence of any employment constraints; again, the two fractions are chosen to

match the levels of demand. Thus, each household optimization problem is
solved twice: once taking only the budget constraint into account, to calculate

"desired" hours, and the second time with the proportional limits imposed for
s2 and 4, to calculate the optimal adjustments in consumption and in hours

worked in the male jobs. With the historical hiring rule, desired hours have
no bearing on a household's LMAJL ; all workers in a given job are given the

same hour limit. This limit may not be a binding constraint in all households,
but it is set to restrict enough workers so as to equate constrained supply

with demand, given each sector's traditional sex ratio in that job. This
6?

hiring rule produces unemployment of one sex (always women, in our experiments)
in the male—dominated jobs, as well as of men and women in the female jobs
(as with the applicant hiring rule).

Under the Nash bargaining formulation, married couples choose an income
transfer from one spouse to the other so as to maximize

If and V are calculated as for a single household; V requires assumptions on the

spousal capital ownership shares and the tax brackets of each after divorce.
The former are shown in text Table 2; for the latter, we assume that a divorced
person would face the sane tax bracket as a currently—single person of the

same sex and skill level. (As noted above, only the skill level is relevant
in comparable worth experiments, because we equalize the two sexes' single—
household tax rates in those cases.)

APPENDIX B

Benchmark Data Set

As noted in

the text, a benchmark economic equilibrium is used as the

starting point for our comparable worth experiments. This appendix provides
the complete reference data set and some brief comments on its derivation.
The two most important sources of data for our benchmark equilibrium are
the 1977 Input-Output tables given in the U.S.

Department of Commerce Surv

of Current ausiness for May 1984, and the 1979 Census of Population 1/1000 (A)
Public Use Sample. We aggregated the finer classifications of the I/O tables
to obtain our five-sector figures for the flows of goods (except to household
consumers) and payments to production factors, and sorted the Census data by

the model's household and job types to derive initial figures for household
characteristics and wage and employment patterns by job. The only Census data
excluded from consideration were those for people under 18 or in
institutions; non-workers were assigned a skill level on the basis of their

completed

own

schooling, rather than by the median educational attainment in

some occupation. Other sources included the 1972-73 Consumer Expenditure

Survey (CES) and the 1977 federal income tax tables. Because these sources
refer to various years and use divergent definitions, a number of adjustments
were

required.
The first step was to adapt the patterns of labor and capital income from

the 1979 Census data to the factor payments of the 1977 I/O tables. The latter
provides the total wage bill for each sector, but does not break this down
into the eight job/sex categories, nor indicate actual work hours. We applied
each

sector's 1979 wage bill distribution by job and sex to the 1977 totals;

and for the eight wage rates needed to calculate work hours from these wage

69

bills, we again took the pattern (i.e., the relative wages) from the Census,
scaled down by the 1977/1979 ratio of total labor income in the economy.
The resulting labor demands were summed over employers to obtain total
hours worked by men and women in each of the four jobs. While the total value
(at the scaled-down wages) of all 1979 work hours equaled the total value of
these labor demands, the distribution by job and sex did not completely match.

Therefore, we increased or decreased the population of each type of household
so as to provide the required labor supplies by job/sex category, while
maintaining the Census figures on the total work hours by a household of each
type, and the relative contribution of each household type to each labor
supply. These revised population figures were used in allocating the capital
income from the I/O tables, again maintaining the Census pattern of capital
ownership ratios between households of different types.

With factor incomes reconciled with the 1977 data, the next step was to
adjust the household expenditure figures. The federal income tax

tables

were

consulted to estimate a simple linear tax function for each household type;

since the I/O government category includes state and local government, the tax
parameters had to be scaled up so that total tax revenues equaled total
government

expenditures. Each type of household was assumed to allocate its

after-tax income across the five production sectors in the value shares
observed for households of that type in the CES 1972-73 interview survey. (The
term 'consumption" in this model includes savings; the I/O investment column

was used to distribute savings wexpenditures.!)
The penultimate step was to scale up the I/O export

trade

figures to attain

balance. Finally, the RAS procedure was applied to the inter-industry

transactions matrix to accommodate the revised levels of household consumption
and

exports.
The results of this process are shown in the accompanying tables.
