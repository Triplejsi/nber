Firm Size and Foreign Direct Investment

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the importance of firm size in explaining foreign direct
investment with data from American and Swedish firms. The results suggest that
firm size only has a threshold effect on foreign investment, an effect on the
decision to invest abroad. Once, however, a firm has jumped the initial barriers
to foreign production, size has no effect on the fraction of the firm's resources
devoted to foreign activity. Among firms that invest in foreign production large
firms do not appear to have any particular advantage over small investing firms.

FIRM SIZE AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT

Magnus Blomstrdm and Robert F. Lipsey*

Introduction

The standard literature on multinationals emphasizes the importance of

firm size in explaining foreign direct investment. A typical statement is
that of Caves, that "the relation between direct investment and firm size
with other factors held constant, has been established statistically"

(1974, p. 280). Some authors take the conclusion a step further to suggest
that large firm size produces not only large foreign operations but also

faster growth abroad. For example, Lall and Streeten write that "success
breeds success in big business" and that Gibrat's Law is not applicable to

the growth of multinationals (1977, p. 28). In other words, large size,

which incorporates the firm's ownership-specific advantages, produces a
cumulative and dynamic effect on the expansion of MNCs (see also Hood and
Young, 1979, Chapter 2).

These descriptions of the role of firm size are often ambiguous. As
Hufbauer (1975) and Swedenborg (1979) have pointed out, they do not make a

clear distinction between the probability or likelihood that a firm would
be a foreign investor and the extent of such investment or, as Swedenborg

describes it, its propensity to operate abroad, the share of its production
that it carries on outside its home

country. The study by Horst (1972),

the basis for most of the statements about the importance of firm size,

dealt only with the probability that a firm would be a foreign investor, or
more specifically, the probability that it would meet the criteria for
being a multinational firm by the definition used in the Harvard Studies
(Vernon, 1971), including that of having a certain number of overseas
operations.

In this paper we examine the relationship between parent size and the
propensity to invest abroad with data for American multinationals that have

become available in the last few years. We compare our results with the
relationship for Swedish multinationals and with earlier analyses of
smaller samples of U.S. firms.

Who invests abroad?
The accepted notion of what characteristics distinguish multinational
parent firms from others is that they are a mixture of

technological—rent

and industrial—organization factors, not completely independent of each

other. Multinational firms have been found to be set apart from others by,
among other characteristics, their large size, high profitability, and

heavy expenditures on R&D and advertising. Horst (1972) concluded that
among U.S.—based firms only size distinguished multinational firms from

others in their industries. The implication is that all the other charac-

—3—
teristics are industry attributes.

Several later studies have confirmed Horst's results for both U.S. and
European multinationals. For instance, Lipsey, Kravis and O'connor (1983),
comparing U.S. firms that invest abroad with those that did not have any
such operations, found that firm size was the most important determinant

of the probability that a firm would invest abroad. Aside from industry
effects and that of size of firm within industries, they also found, in
contrast to earlier studies, two variables that influenced the selection of

foreign investors within industries. One was the extent of input to R & 0,

and the other was profitability. The latter might reflect the output from
investment in technology or in other assets such as advertising that are
not capitalized.

In her study of Swedish multinationals, Swedenborg (1979) also confirmed Horst's finding as to relation of firm size to the probability of

being a foreign investor. She showed, however, that Swedish firms on the
average were smaller than U.S. firms when they ventured abroad for the
first time, and suggested that it was the firm's size relative to its home
market rather than its absolute size that determined when it went abroad.

Thus, the evidence of the influence of size on the likelihood or proba-

bility of foreign investment is quite strong. The size effect may differ
between industries, as well as between countries, but there is little doubt

that it exists. However, that evidence tells us nothing about what determines the extent of foreign production among firms that do produce abroad.

That is, it does not tell us whether, among such firms, larger ones produce
a higher proportion of their output abroad.

-4—
Size of firms and the propensity to produce abroad
The only publicly available data separating the domestic and foreign

operations of individual U.S. firms are those reported to the Securities

and Exchange Commission since the late 1970s. We have taken from Standard
and Poor's Compustat tapes a sample consisting of 183 U.S. manufacturing
firms that reported foreign operation in 1982, and sufficient additional
information to construct the other variables required by our equations.
There are several nays to test for the influence of size on the propen-

sity to operate abroad. Equation 1 relates the log of foreign sales to the
log of domestic sales and Equation 2 adds several reputed determinants of
foreign investment to the size variable (standard errors in parentheses):

.97 log OS - .86

(1) Log ES =

No. Obs. = 183

measured by the assets per employee for

RD = R&D expenditures as per cent of sales for
the consolidated firm
AD =

expenditures as per cent of sales
for the consolidated firm.

Equations 3 and 4 are the corresponding equations using domestic and
foreign assets (DA, FA) as measures of size and foreign activity:

1.01 log

(4) Log FA = 1.02

6.11 RD + 3.72 AD — 1.67
(1.70)

(1.39)

.75

(.40)

No. Obs. = 183

A coefficient of one for domestic sales or domestic assets implies
that, across firms, a doubling of domestic size is associated with a

doubling of foreign operations, but no more or less than that. In all
these cases the coefficient of domestic size does not differ significantly

from one. Although these are cross-section rather than time series data,
the coefficients could be interpreted as implying that among these firms,
growth in the domestic market would typically be associated with growth at
the same rate in foreign markets.

the addition of the firm's capital intensity, R&O intensity and advertising intensity to the equations did not affect the size coefficient

significantly. The directions of their influences on foreign investment propensities are as expected, but there is no indication that size acted as a

proxy for any of them. Results for three industry groups, reported in
Appendix Tables I and 2, were essentially the same as regards the size
effect, although there were some differences in the influence of the other
variables.

A more direct test of the relation of firm size to the propensity to
operate abroad is to relate the propensity itself, as measured by the ratio
of foreign to domestic sales (denoted RATIO), to the domestic size of the

firm. Equations 5.and 6 give these relationships in log of size with and
without additional variables.

No. Obs. = 183

In no case is there a positive significant coefficient for domestic firm
size.

In fact, these equations show more evidence for a decline rather

than for a rise in the propensity to invest abroad as size of firm increases.
We also related the ratio of foreign to domestic sales to size itself, in

arithmetic form, and, to test for nonlinearity, a squared size term. Both
coefficients turned out to be zero (Appendix Table 3). All in all, the
data indicate clearly that the size of the firm has no positive influence
on the propensity to operate abroad, once a firm has jumped the initial
barriers to foreign production.

We also ran a set of parallel equations for 109 Swedish multinationals
(virtually all there were) using data from the rUT 1978 survey of Swedish

investment abroad (Swedenborg, 1982). As can be seen from equations 7 and 8,
and others parallel to the U.S. equations (Appendix Table 4), the
regressions provided results similar to those for U.S. firms (even the test
for nonlinearity).

log DS +

.00 log KL + 2.82 RD + .03
(.06)

(1.31)

R2 = .06 No. Obs. = 109

(.34)

This confirms the findings for Swedish firms in 1974 (Swedenborg,

1979). However, in that study the coefficient for domestic sales size,

—7—
close to unity when no other variables were included in the equation, was
reduced below one in an equation relating foreign affiliate sales not only
to domestic sales, but also to R & D intensity, physical-capital intensity,
labor skill (or human capital intensity), and age of the oldest foreign

operation, the last two of which were variables we could not match in the
U.S. data.

Conclusion

We conclude that while size of firm is the major determinant of the
probability of foreign direct investment, it is important only as a

threshold effect. Once the firm has jumped the initial barriers to foreign
production, size has no effect on the fraction of the firm's resources

devoted to foreign activity. Therefore, among firms that invest in foreign
production, large firms do not appear to have any particular advantage over

small firms. Nothing in our results supports the fears sometimes expressed
that the advantages of large firm size must lead to increasing concentration within the foreign production of multinationals or their world-

wide operations. Outside of a fringe of small firms, concentration in
foreign production must be little different from that in domestic production.
