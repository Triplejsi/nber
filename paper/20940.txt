The Impact of Intergroup Contact on Racial Attitudes and Revealed Preferences

NBER Working Paper No. 20940

JEL No. I24,J15
ABSTRACT
Understanding whether racial attitudes are malleable is critical for addressing the underlying causes
of racial discrimination. We examine whether white males' stated attitudes and behavior toward African
Americans change based on the number and type of black peers to whom they are exposed. To overcome
selection bias, we exploit data from the U.S. Air Force Academy in which students are randomly assigned
to peer groups. Results show significant evidence in favor of the contact hypothesis. White males are
significantly affected by both the number (quantity) and aptitude (quality) of the black peers with whom
they are exposed. Specifically, white men randomly assigned to higher-aptitude black peers report
being more accepting of blacks in general and are more likely to match with a black roommate the
following year after reassignment to a new peer group with a different set of black peers. We also
find that, ceteris paribus, exposure to more black peers significantly increases the probability of a biracial roommate match.

Introduction

Considerable attention has been paid to developing the theory of racial discrimination as well as to
documenting its empirical prevalence (see Lang and Lehmann (2012) for a thorough recent review.)
By comparison, less is known about how people form racial attitudes, and whether and how these
attitudes change over time. The purpose of this paper is to address not only how racial attitudes
change, but whether any changes in attitude are accompanied by observable changes in behavior
toward other groups.
We do so in the context of the contact hypothesis, a concept first introduced by Williams Jr
(1947) and Allport (1954) in which interpersonal contact can be an effective way of reducing
prejudice between groups. The primary difficulty in empirically assessing the contact hypothesis
has been overcoming selection and simultaneity problems. As a result, while the cross-sectional
evidence is generally consistent with this hypothesis (Pettigrew, 1998), a lingering concern is that
this relationship could be driven by reverse causation or confounding factors that impact both
attitudes and the choice to associate with other groups. These concerns have led to a handful of
studies in which intergroup contact is randomly assigned. Most of these studies have focused on
settings such as college dormitory and roommate assignments, where increased proximity has been
shown to increase frequency of inter-race contact via email (Marmaros and Sacerdote, 2006) and
Facebook (Baker, Mayer and Puller, 2011). This approach has been used by Boisjoly, Duncan,
Kremer, Levy and Eccles (2006) and Laar, Levin, Sinclair and Sidanius (2005), who exploit the
random assignment of black roommates to examine the impact of intergroup contact on the racial
attitudes of white college students, as measured by responses to surveys. Both find that racial
attitudes improve as a result of increased exposure to black peers.
While these papers offer compelling causal evidence on the impact of increased intergroup
interaction on racial attitudes, data limitations have left some important questions unanswered. The
first is whether (randomly) increased intergroup contact and the improvement in racial attitudes
leads to meaningful changes in behavior toward new and different members of the other racial group.
In addition, relatively little is known about whether it is the type (i.e., quality) or the number (i.e.,
quantity) of members from the minority group that influences racial attitudes of the majority group.

1

This is an important limitation, given that in Allport’s (1954) formulation of the contact hypothesis,
increased contact only improves attitudes when participants have equal status. Similarly, given the
economic literatures on statistical discrimination and Bayesian updating, one would expect that
individuals would update their statistical or taste-based discriminatory preferences based on the
characteristics of the individuals to whom they were exposed.
This paper directly addresses the question of whether the racial attitudes and behavior of white
males change based on either the number or type of black peers with whom they interact. To
do so, we exploit data in which freshman students at the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) are
randomly assigned to peer groups, called squadrons, with whom they live, eat, and train. We ask
whether exposure to more or higher aptitude black peers affects white males’ subsequent stated
or revealed preference for African Americans. Stated preference is measured by the response to a
survey question that asks how personal acceptance of African Americans has changed since arriving
at the academy. Revealed preference is measured by the likelihood of a white male rooming with a
black student in their sophomore year, when students are randomly reassigned to a new squadron
with a different set of black peers.
This approach to assessing the contact hypothesis contributes to the existing literature in several
ways. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use random assignment to examine how racial
attitudes change based on both the number and type of individuals from the minority group with
whom one interacts. In addition, rather than relying solely on surveys and their potential pitfalls
to measure racial attitudes, we ask whether increased intergroup contact in the freshman year
leads to meaningful changes in subsequent behavior toward a new and different set of black men in
the sophomore year. This enables us to determine whether increased exposure to more or higher
aptitude black peers leads white men to spend significantly more time with new African Americans
they meet in the future. Thus, the effects we find are more likely to reflect a fundamental change in
racial attitudes compared to the previous research that has primarily focused on survey responses.
Results show considerable evidence that racial attitudes and behavior are malleable. Both
the number (quantity) and the aptitude (quality) of the black peers to whom white males are
exposed play an important role in changing racial attitudes and behavior toward African Americans.
Specifically, white males who are exposed to higher-aptitude black peers during their freshman year
2

report more favorable attitudes toward African Americans generally. Additionally, exposure to more
black peers and blacks with higher academic aptitudes significantly increases the likelihood that a
white male matches with a black roommate in the following year. Estimates indicate that a one
standard deviation increase in black peer aptitude increases a white male’s likelihood of rooming
with a black male by 15 percent. Importantly, this impact on roommate pairings in the sophomore
year is robust to excluding the small proportion of white-black pairs who by chance were also in
the same freshman squadron.
Interestingly, the impact of higher aptitude black peers on the roommate choices of white males
is primarily driven by white males from southern states, where racial prejudice has historically been
most prevalent. Estimates are striking; moving a southern white male from the first quartile to the
fourth quartile of the peer black aptitude distribution increases the probability he will room with
a black roommate by 35.2 percent.
These findings have important implications for our understanding of how people form, and
change, racial attitudes. Results from this study indicate that not only can racial attitudes change
based on the type and number of people with whom they interact from other racial groups, but
they can do so even for people from regions that have exhibited historically high levels of racism.
Furthermore, our results indicate that these changes in racial attitudes can lead to meaningful
changes in behavior toward new and different members of the minority group.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents the theoretical framework
for our study. Section III describes the data. Section IV discusses the methods and presents results.
Section V concludes.

Theoretical Framework

Incoming freshman students at the US Air Force Academy are placed into military squadrons of
around 35 members without any input from the affected students according to a stratified random
sorting algorithm (Carrell, Fullerton and West, 2009; Carrell, Sacerdote and West, 2013). This
algorithm uniformly distributes females, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, recruited
athletes, and alumni of the Air Force Academy Preparatory School across each squadron without

3

any regard to academic ability. At the end of the freshman year, students are removed from their
freshman squadron and placed by the same stratified random sort algorithm into a new squadron,
which we will denote as Si , where i = 1..36. Following Chung’s (2000) model of roommate matching,
let squadron members sj ∈ Si have preferences over possible roommate choices sk ∈ Si k 6= i. We
assume preferences to be complete, reflexive, and transitive, but formed under limited information
on the set of possible roommates.
Our primary point of interest in this paper is the evolution of preferences under limited information. The literature on learning in game theoretic experiments provides useful guidance. In this
literature, two broad approaches exist; belief-based learning (Cheung and Friedman, 1997; Crawford, 1995; Cooper, Garvin and Kagel, 1997) in which players form beliefs about what players will
do in the future based on past play, and reinforcement learning (Roth and Erev, 1995; McAllister, 1991; Sarin and Vahid, 1999) in which strategies are reinforced by payoffs in previous rounds
of the game. Camerer and Ho (1999) develop a more general framework of which both belief-based
learning and reinforcement learning are special cases. In their ‘Experience-Weighted Attraction’
model, “strategies have attractions that reflect initial predispositions, are updated based on payoff
experience, and determine choice probabilities according to some rule, ” (Camerer and Ho, 1999).
Adapting this approach to preferences under limited information, we assume student sj enters
the Air Force Academy with initial attractions to various observable group attributes g ∈ G, Agj (0).
The set of group attributes, G, can include members of an academic major, classmates from previous
coursework, residents of a given state, members of an athletic team, or of particular interest in this
study, a member of a given racial or ethnic minority group. As in Camerer and Ho (1999), we
assume these initial attractions are functions of pre-Academy experiences or introspection. During
the freshman year, group attraction Agj (1) updates based on discounted own experiences with
members of group g and observed experiences of others with group g.
We propose that sj determines the extent to which he believes potential roommate sk is a
member of group g, mj (k, g) ∈ [0, 1]. Let the weighted attraction of sk to sj at the beginning of

4

the sophomore year (period 2) be

Wjk (2) =

X

mj (k, g)Agj (2)

g∈G

and let the preferences of sj be informed by a rank ordering of Wjk (2) over possible roommate
choices sk ∈ Si .
Given the rank ordering of weighted attractions at the beginning of the sophomore year, roommates are matched. A matching µ is a function Si −→ Si such that for all {sj , sk } ∈ Si , µ(sj ) = sk
if and only if µ(sk ) = sj . As single rooms are not allowed, we assume that a triple occupancy room
must exist if Si contains an odd number of members. We assume individual rationality, i.e., that
no students are forced to be roommates in the sophomore year.

Data

3.1

The Dataset

Our primary dataset is comprised of the USAFA graduating classes of 2002 and 2004-2007. We omit
the graduating class of 2003 from our sample because members of this class were not reassigned to
new squadrons at the beginning of their sophomore year. These data contain four individual-level
measurements of pre-Air Force Academy ability: SAT scores1 , an Academic Composite, computed
by USAFA Admissions as a weighted average of high school GPA, class rank, and the quality of the
high school attended, a Leadership Composite of high school and community activities, and a Fitness
Score. In addition, our data contain the state of residence and basic demographic information. In
Table I, we present summary statistics at the individual by semester level for white male students.
Column 1 shows statistics for all white male students.
To these data we match our primary outcome of interest: roommate matches in the sophomore
year. The Air Force Academy does not maintain official records on roommate assignments. However, we were able to obtain the official key log, which contains records on the issuing and returning
of keys to dorm rooms. By matching records, we were able to determine individuals assigned to
1

the same dorm room for a variety of lengths of time. In columns 2 through 4 of Table I we report
statistics for white males for whom we were able to identify roommate[s] for one or more days. This
comprises 99.4 percent of all white male students. Column 2 reports statistics for all white male
students for whom we identified roommate[s] for one or more days. Column 3 reports the subset of
white male students who were paired with a non-black roommate and column 4 reports for those
with a black roommate. For the main specifications in our analysis, we define a roommate pair as
anyone assigned to the same dorm room for at least 90 days during the academic semester, though
we also report robustness results using a range of definitions. For the 90 day definition, we were
able to identify roommates for 96.9 percent of white males. Using a more restrictive definition of
at least 240 days within the academic year, we were able to identify roommates for 88 percent of
white male students.
Since roommate matches occur within squadrons, we report demographic and pre-collegiate
aptitude statistics at the squadron level in Table II. Due to the small number of black students per
squadron, the standard deviations of all variables are considerably larger for black students than
white male students, although the squadron-level mean values are quite similar.
Our secondary analysis uses data from a climate survey administered to students at USAFA
during the spring semester of 2010. This survey asked respondents whether their acceptance towards
certain groups (e.g., blacks) has changed since entering the Academy. See Appendix 1 for a copy
of the survey. Due to anonymity of the survey, responses were only made available for white males
with identifiers by squadron for the graduating class of 2013. To these data we matched squadronlevel group characteristics. Survey response rates were just under 50 percent. Although we cannot
completely rule out selection into survey taking due to anonymity concerns that prevent us from
having respondent-level covariates other than squadron, we can test whether there is selection in
response rates at the squadron level. To do so, in Appendix Table A.1 we show that the number
of survey responses by squadron is uncorrelated with squadron-level mean black or white male
characteristics (p = 0.432 on a joint significance F-test).

3.2

Squadron Assignment and Variation in Black Peer Characteristics

Squadrons at the Air Force Academy are comprised of approximately 35 members each of the
freshman through senior classes. Members of a squadron share rooms, dine together, play intramural
sports together, and undergo military training together. Freshmen members of a squadron have
very limited contact with members of other squadrons through the end of March outside of academic
classes and intercollegiate sports team participation.
Prior to the start of the freshman and sophomore years, administrators at USAFA implement a
stratified random assignment process in which females are first randomly assigned, followed by male
ethnic and racial minorities, then white male recruited athletes, then white males who attended a
military preparatory school, and then all remaining white male students. This critical feature of
our data set enables us to overcome bias due to self-selection into peer groups.
To be a viable test of whether inter-race contact affects racial attitudes and behavior, our
research design relies on random sampling variation in the attributes of black peers across squadrons.
Figure 1 shows the variation in our academic aptitude measures at the individual and squadronlevel for both blacks and white male students. While blacks and white males have similar means
and standard deviations in individual SAT and academic composite scores, there is considerable
heterogeneity in average peer characteristics across squadrons. The average squadron-level mean
SAT score of black students is 1205. The standard deviation of squadron means within cohorts
is 94.2. Mean SAT scores range from 920 to 1,465 across squadrons. Likewise normalized mean
squadron-level academic composite scores range from -2.39 to 3.71 standard deviations.2
Due to the stratified nature of the random assignment process, the variation in the number
of black peers across squadrons is less than one would expect under pure random assignment.
However, there still remains considerable variation in the within-cohort number of blacks across
squadrons. The average squadron has 1.59 black peers, with a range from zero to four. The mean
within-cohort standard deviation in the number of black peers is 0.876. The within-cohort variation
in the number of black peers across squadrons comes from three sources of exogenous variation.3
2

These statistics exclude the eleven squadrons in our sample that had zero black peers
There is also considerable variation in the number of black students across cohorts, which ranges from 79 blacks
in the graduating class of 2004 and 41 blacks in the class of 2007. We include cohort fixed effects in all of our models
and thereby exploit only the within-cohort variation in the number of black peers across squadrons.

First, the squadron assignment algorithm places female students into squadrons irrespective of race,
allowing for a non-uniform placement of black females to squadrons. Second, USAFA administrators
determine assignments to squadrons well prior to matriculation and the start of basic military
training. Thus, attrition from the sample through students failing to matriculate either by changing
their mind and not showing up, suffering an injury during basic training4 , or quitting during basic
training offers an additional source of exogenous variation in the number of black peers across
squadrons. Third, late admits and students who suffered injuries or illness during the previous
year’s basic training (called “turnbacks”) are randomly assigned to squadrons irrespective of race
and after the completion of the initial assignment process. These three processes which affect the
number of black students assigned to each squadron occur without regard to the characteristics of
white male students. For this reason, we do not expect to find any systematic correlation between
the number of black students per squadron and the characteristics of white peers.
The integrity of our research design critically depends upon the random assignment of students
to squadrons conditional on the stratified random sorting algorithm and matriculation. Carrell and
West (2010) and Carrell et al. (2013) provide empirical evidence consistent with random assignment
into squadrons with respect to academic ability, athletic ability, and leadership ability. In Table
A.1, we provide additional tests of whether there is any systematic correlation between attributes
of white males and the average attributes of black peers assigned to the same squadron during the
freshman and sophomore year.
For this and other regressions in the paper, we determine statistical significance using empirical
p-values5 from 1000 draws of the relevant process, here the squadron assignment algorithm. The
empirical p-values represent the fraction of draws where the actual coefficient estimated from our
data is greater than the estimated coefficients from the 1000 simulated draws. Hence, this procedure
compares correlations between white male attributes and average attributes of black students with
the counterfactual of white males from the appropriate class year being distributed among squadrons
according to the USAFA stratified random sorting algorithm. Of the 65 selection coefficients, 11
are significant at the 10 percent level, six of which are significant at the 5 percent level, and one
4

Students who are injured and cannot finish basic training are not allowed to matriculate into the fall academic
semester.

This approach to inference is similar to that used by Chetty, Looney and Kroft (2009)

8

of which is significant at the 1 percent level. One group of five coefficients (out of 13) is found
to be jointly significant at the 10-percent level. We interpret these results as broadly consistent
with a random draw from the USAFA stratified random sorting algorithm, which by design does
not create systematic correlation between attributes of white and black students assigned to the
same squadron. Importantly the magnitude of all the correlates is quite small and the coefficients
vary in sign. For instance, a one standard deviation increase in average squadron black academic
composite is associated with a mere 0.037 decrease in white male academic composite.

Methods and Results

4.1

Methods

To determine whether white males are significantly affected by variation in the quantity or quality
of the black peers they are exposed to during their freshman year, we estimate the following linear
probability model:6


B
B
P µit (sW
j ) = sk = φ1 + φ2 X̄jt−1 + γt + ijt
W

B
where P[µit (sW

B
B
and black male student sB
k ∈ Si are matched as roommates. X̄jt−1 are the black peer characteristics

that individual j is exposed to during his freshman year, t − 1. The primary peer characteristics
of interest measure the academic aptitude of the black peers (mean SAT scores and Academic
Composite) and the number of black peers by squadron. Because white males are exogenously
assigned to black peers in the freshman year, estimates of these φ2 coefficients are free from selection
bias. γt is a cohort fixed effect and ist is the error term.

4.2

Main Roommate Results

Table III presents our main results. Here, we define a roommate match as any two individuals who
were assigned to the same dorm room for a period of at least 90 days during the fall or spring
semester. Specification 1 begins by estimating a parsimonious specification that only includes
6

Our results are robust to a Probit specification. See Table A.2

9

the main explanatory variables of interest and a cohort fixed effect. Due to the design of the
assignment process, which places students into squadrons, adding additional control variables to
the model should not, in theory, significantly affect the magnitudes of our coefficients of interest.
The remaining specifications in Table III sequentially add control variables to the model.
The pattern of results in Table III provides significant evidence in favor of the contact hypothesis.
White males are significantly more likely to room with a black student in their sophomore year
after increased exposure in their freshman year to more black peers and black peers with higher
academic aptitude. The magnitudes of the effects are quite sizeable. Using the coefficients from our
preferred Specification 6, we find that a one-standard deviation increase in the number of freshman
black peers (0.876 persons from column 3, Table II) is associated with a statistically significant
0.79 percentage point increase in the probability of having a black roommate, which represents a
14.5 percent increase over the sample average of 5.45 percentage points from Table I.
Likewise, a one standard deviation increase in peer black academic composite is associated
with a 19.5 percent7 statistically significant increase in the probability of a white male matching
with a black roommate. On the contrary, we find no statistically significant relationship between
peer black SAT scores and the probability of a roommate match, though the estimated effects are
positive.8
Importantly, the effect sizes we find remain virtually unchanged in Specification 2-4 as we
add controls for own demographic characteristics, non-black freshman peer characteristics, and
characteristics of the black upperclassman in the freshman squadron. This is consistent with our
expectations given the absence of selection in the squadron assignment process.
In Specification 5 we include controls for the academic attributes (SAT scores and academic
composite) of the black peers in the sophomore squadron within which roommate matches are
made. In Specification 6 we include a sophomore squadron fixed effect to control for any unobservable differences in sophomore black peer characteristics. In both specifications our estimated
coefficients of interest again remain virtually unchanged. These results indicate that exposure
during the freshman year to more and higher aptitude black peers increases the probability of a
7

0.0105/0.0545 = 0.195
We note that the academic composite effect may dominate the SAT effect because academic composite is a much
better predictor of grade performance at USAFA, particularly for blacks.

10

white-black roommate match in the sophomore year irrespective of the academic aptitude of potential sophomore black roommates. Hence, these results suggest that the effects we find increase
the relative attractiveness of all black students at the Air Force Academy, not just those blacks
with higher academic aptitude.
In Specification 7-10 we conduct a series of robustness checks. Specification 7 reweights the
estimates by the inverse probability of a roommate match to rule out the possibility that the
results are driven by selection into the roommate key file. Specification 8 excludes all white males
who were randomly assigned to the same sophomore squadron as a black peer from their freshman
squadron. We do this to ensure that the results are not driven by the small fraction of white
sophomore men who happened to be able to room with black men from their freshman squadron
with whom they are likely personally acquainted. In Specification 9, we control for other black peer
characteristics that are potentially correlated with academic aptitude (military preparatory school
attendance, recruited athlete, leadership composite and fitness score). Finally, in Specification 10,
we control for state of residence fixed effects. In all these robustness specifications the effects we
find in support of the contact hypothesis remain virtually unchanged.
In Table IV, we test the robustness of our preferred estimate (Specification 6) to various roommate definitions. Across all definitions of roommates from one day to 240 days we again find
consistent evidence in favor of the contact hypothesis. Exposure in the freshman year to more
black peers and black peers with higher academic aptitude significantly increases the likelihood
that a white male matches with a black roommate in the sophomore year, regardless of roommate
definition. In the most restrictive definition of a roommate, 240 days assigned to the same room,
higher SAT scores of black freshman peers now increases the probability of a bi-racial roommate
match in addition to the Academic Composite.

4.3

Heterogeneous Effects

A natural question is whether the effects we find are heterogeneous across incoming attitudes
towards race. Although we cannot directly measure incoming attitudes or levels of racial prejudice,

11

our dataset does contain information on each student’s home state of residence.9 Research has
shown that the level of racial bias varies considerably across the United States, with southern states
exhibiting the highest levels of racial prejudice(Mas and Moretti, 2009; Stephens-Davidowitz, 2013).
Therefore, in Table V, we estimate separate coefficients for our main variables of interest for
students who come from southern or northern states.10 Results indicate that while there are few
differences by region in the impact of the number of black freshman peers, the magnitude of the
academic aptitude effect is roughly two times larger for white males who come from southern
versus northern states. For Specification 6, the estimated coefficient of 0.0116 indicates that a onestandard deviation increase in peer black freshman academic composite is associated with a 22.3
percent increase in the probability of a southern white male matching to a black roommate in the
sophomore year. On the contrary, the estimated effect for northern white males is approximately
half as large and statistically insignificant at 11.5 percent. We do not have the ability to carefully
identify the cause of this observed difference in the magnitude and significance of effects. But we
are intrigued by the possibility that the effect of higher freshman black peer academic composite
on the probability of a bi-racial roommate match is the result of southern white males favorably
updating their priors regarding African Americans.

4.4

Results on Stated Attitudes

As an alternative measure of racial attitudes and to shed light on why intergroup contact affects
roommate pairings, we exploit data from a 2010 USAFA Climate Survey in which students were
asked to, “Please rate how your acceptance towards African Americans/Blacks has changed since
you came to USAFA.” Possible responses included: “Much less accepting”, “Somewhat less accepting”, “No Change”, “Somewhat more accepting”, and “Much more accepting”. We use responses
to this question to analyze how the quantity and quality of black peers affect stated attitudes of
white males towards blacks. Unfortunately, this survey question was only administered in one
9
The military academies are unique in the fact that admissions are made within each congressional district and
state. Each member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate is allotted five total slots at each service
academy in any given year. This process ensures the student body is representative of population centers throughout
the United States.
10
We define southern males as those whose residence is in the original fifteen confederate states: AL, AK, FL, GA,
KY, LA, MS, MO, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA, and WV. Northern males by definition come from all other states and
territories.

12

year (2010), thus our analysis of these data is limited to the freshman students who formed the
graduating class of 2013.
In Table VI we report results from a series of linear probability models in which we regress
the stated probability of white males being either more or less accepting of blacks on our three
primary measures of peer black characteristics (academic composite, SAT score, and number).
Though limited by small sample size, results from this analysis are broadly consistent with those
previously shown on roommate choices. The estimate from Specification 3 indicates that a onestandard deviation increase in peer black academic composite leads white males to report that they
are 2.4 percentage points (14.2 percent) more likely to report they are “more accepting” of African
Americans generally, though the estimate is not statistically significant. Likewise, being exposed to
a one-standard deviation increase in the number of black peers leads white males to be 7.7 percent
more likely to report being “more accepting” of African Americans.
Results in Specification 6 show larger and more precisely estimated effects for negative responses
to the survey. A one-standard deviation increase in peer black academic composite is associated
with a statistically significant 49-percent decrease in the probability a white male reports being
“less accepting” of blacks.11
Although this survey analysis is limited by the lack of power (i.e., a single graduation cohort of
2013) and potential non-response bias (approximately 50 percent response), the broadly consistent
findings offers evidence that the effects on roommates is not likely driven by either the uniqueness
of the outcome variable or the particular cohorts of students in the roommate study (graduates
from 2002-2007). Rather, evidence from both sets of outcomes provides evidence that exposure
to more and higher ability black peers leads white men to have more favorable opinions of blacks
generally, and to reveal those improved attitudes when making important choices about whether
to spend significant amounts of time with African Americans in the future.
11

Of the 427 survey respondents, 16.86 percent (72 students) reported being “more accepting”, 3.04 percent (13
students) reported being “more accepting”, and 80.28 percent (342 students) reported “No Change”.

13

4.5

Generalizability to Other Groups

A final question remains regarding whether the effects we find are limited to blacks or whether
there is evidence in support of the contact hypothesis across other groups as our theory section
would suggest. To answer this question we repeat our roommate analysis for Hispanics, Asians,
members of the football team, and recruited athletes. Results are reported in Table VII. For
comparison purposes, Specification 1 repeats results for blacks reported in Specification 6 of Table
III while Specifications 2-5 report results for these additional groups. Consistent with our findings
for blacks, we find that increased exposure to Hispanics, Asians, football players, and athletes
during the freshman year significantly increases the probability of a roommate match during the
sophomore year between white male students and members of each under-represented group. For
the football players, we also find a significant relationship between the probability of a roommate
match and average football player academic composite during the freshman year. This is the only
group other than African Americans for which the academic composite is significantly correlated
with the probability of a roommate match.12 Overall, these results provide evidence consistent
with the contact hypothesis for additional groups.

Discussion and Conclusion

This study provides an empirical test of whether white males’ racial attitudes are affected by either
the quantity or type of black peers to whom they are exposed. Using data from the U.S. Air Force
Academy (USAFA) in which students are randomly assigned to peer groups in their freshman year
and subsequently reassigned into different peer groups in their sophomore year, we show that white
men’s stated and revealed preferences for African Americans improve significantly after exposure to
more and higher ability black peers. Specifically, we find that exposure to more and higher ability
black peers leads white men subsequently to choose to spend considerably more time with African
Americans – as measured by roommate matches –and report feeling more favorably about African
Americans generally. We find evidence that these effects are applicable to other non-majority
groups.
12

Since 12.9 percent of football players are African American, we believe it unlikely that this result is driven by
black football players alone.

14

These results provide several important takeaways. First, while we add to the evidence suggesting that exposure to more members of the minority group improves racial attitudes, we also
document that the type of members from that group affects racial attitudes. These latter effects
are important; a one standard deviation increase in black peer aptitude has the same impact on
revealed preference for blacks as does a one standard deviation increase in the number of black
peers. This highlights the importance of the type of individual with whom one interacts, as well
as the frequency of interaction, which is consistent with models in which individuals update prior
attitudes regarding other groups. In addition, the importance of the type of individuals with whom
one interacts also speaks to the tradeoff between increasing exposure to members of historically
disadvantaged groups, and changing the composition of those members.

13

Finally, our results also illustrate that exposure to more and higher aptitude African American
peers can lead to significant changes in subsequent behavior. Importantly, these changes in behavior
are toward an entirely new and different set of African Americans. This provides rare causal
evidence that increased contact does more than change self-reported attitudes; it also leads to
meaningful changes in behavior toward African Americans.

13

For example, by design affirmative action policies increase the number of individuals from disadvantaged groups
with whom one interacts, while presumably lowering the average ability levels of members of that group at the
institution. While our estimates are not well-suited for predicting the net impact of a major affirmative action policy,
we can perform back-of-the-envelope calculations regarding the impact of adding a black student with below-average
academic aptitude to a squadron without any black students. Estimates from Table III indicate that the net impact
of adding the marginal student would increase net revealed preference for blacks so long as academic ability were not
reduced by more than 1.33 standard deviations.
