NBER Working Paper No. 20967
February 2015
JEL No. K4,Z1
ABSTRACT
While both cultural and legal norms (institutions) help foster cooperation, culture is the more primitive
of the two and itself sustains formal institutions. Cultural changes are rarer and slower than changes
in legal institutions, which makes it difficult to identify the role played by culture. Cultural changes
and their effects are easier to identify in simpler, more controlled, environments, such as corporations.
Corporate culture, thus, is not only interesting per se, but also as a laboratory to study the role of societal
culture and the way it can be changed.

By LUIGI GUISO, PAOLA SAPIENZA

AND LUIGI ZINGALES

While both cultural and legal norms (institutions) help foster cooperation, culture is the more primitive of the two
and itself sustains formal institutions. Cultural changes are rarer and slower than changes in legal institutions,
which makes it difficult to identify the role played by culture. Cultural changes and their effects are easier to identify
in simpler, more controlled, environments, such as corporations. Corporate culture, thus, is not only interesting per
se, but also as a laboratory to study the role of societal culture and the way it can be changed.

has documented (e.g. Giuliano, 2007; Guiso et

La Porta et al. (2008) identify a remarkable
pattern of correlations between a country legal
origins and its protection of property rights.
They attribute it to the difference in legal
traditions. To what extent this difference
simply reflects cultural differences? After all,
many countries (such as Japan and China)
chose which legal tradition to adopt based on
cultural affinities. Others, for the same reason,
shifted legal traditions (like Italy). Similarly,
Acemoglu et al. (2001), attribute economic
success to the type of legal institutions
designed by the colonizing power. Yet, if this
was the only factor, it would suffice to imitate
the U.S. constitution to prosper. Many Latin
American countries tried and failed. Social
norms are needed to sustain legal norms.
When laws are in conflict with norms
compliance and enforcement are weaker

States the cultural foundation of the law is

what triggers cultural change and how new
Thus, culture underpins and color the law,
but legal institution can shape cultural norms.
Despite the abundant literature on the role of
culture, it is difficult to sort out the direction
of causality. One of the key issues is where
culture comes from. One source is production
technology, such as the plough (Alesina et al.,
2013). Another is a politically or military

domination (Putnam, 1993; Guiso et al.;
2008a; Grosjean, 2011) or the adoption (or
imposition) of a new religion (e.g. Basten and
Betz, 2013). But these “cultural revolutions”
are rare events, often taking place over several
centuries with many other things occurring at
the same time. Lacking sufficient observations
of cultural changes, to try identify the effects
of culture on economic (and other) outcomes

norms and beliefs replace older ones, it is
impossible to understand whether and when
cultural norms can be relied upon as policy
instruments and how they relate to legal
norms. Do cultural norms crowd out or
strengthen legal norms? Which type of norms
– cultural or legal - is more effective in
pursuing a certain policy, such as increasing
tax compliance or fighting corruption? If new
cultural norms and beliefs clash against
existing ones, how does the political economy
of cultural revolutions works?
