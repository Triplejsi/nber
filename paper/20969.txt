Individual Time Preferences and Energy Efficiency
Richard G. Newell and Juha V. Siikamaki
NBER Working Paper No. 20969
February 2015
JEL No. D9,H43,Q41,Q48
ABSTRACT
We examine the role of individual discount rates in energy efficiency decisions using evidence from
an extensive survey of U.S. homeowners to elicit preferences for energy efficiency and cash flows
over time. We find considerable heterogeneity in individual discount rates. We also find that individual
time preferences systematically influence willingness to invest in energy efficiency, as measured through
product choices, required payback periods, and energy efficiency tax credit claims. Individual discount
rate heterogeneity is in turn significantly related to characteristics of the individual and their household,
including their financial situation. Individuals with less education, larger households, low income,
and low credit scores had systematically higher discount rates, as did black, non-Hispanic respondents.
Our findings highlight the importance of individual discount rates to understanding energy efficiency
investments, the energy-efficiency gap, and policy evaluation.

Finally, we add a random element to the

individual discount rates and WTP for EE
(Table 1, column 1; details in Table A2).

The survey also asked respondents directly to
state their maximum WTP for a $10 reduction
in annual energy costs (see appendix). OLS
estimation results show a robust, statistically
significant association between the individual
discount rate and WTP for EE (both in logs).
The coefficient on the individual discount rate
(Table 1, column 2; details in Table A3),
indicates that the elasticity of WTP with
respect to the discount rate is about -0.08
to -0.10. This result is consistent qualitatively
with the findings based on the more detailed
choice experiment (Eq 1 and 2).

number of bedrooms; whether the home has a new water heater; and

Payback Period Required for EE Investments
The survey also directly asked respondents
their “payback” preferences—how quickly a
more EE water heater should recover its
additional purchase price through energy
savings to remain attractive (see appendix).
Respondents stated a mean and median
payback threshold of 3.5 years, with a standard
deviation of 1.9 years. Again, OLS estimation
results show a consistent and statistically
significant association between the individual
discount rate and payback years (both in logs).
The coefficient on the individual discount rate
(Table 1, column 3; details in Table A4)
indicates that the elasticity of payback period
with

respect

to

the

discount

rate

is

roughly -0.05 to -0.08. The finding is again
consistent with expectations: the greater the
discount rate, the shorter the time horizon
required for the investment to break even.
Tax Credits for EE Investments
Federal tax credits to promote household
investments in EE were in place 2006–2011.
These credits were popular, with 23 percent of
single family homeowners in our sample taking
advantage of the credits. We examine the

drivers of the tax credit choice, including income, likelihood the

factors determining who claimed EE tax
credits, with particular interest in whether
individual discount rates are associated with
tax credit claims.6 The estimation results
indicate that the likelihood of claiming a tax
credit is systematically associated with lower
individual discount rates, higher household
income, and a lower likelihood of moving
(Table 1, column 4; details in Table A5). The
likelihood of claiming the tax credit increases
as the individual discount rate decreases. This
is as expected because WTP for EE is higher
for households with relatively low discount
rates, so they are higher on the demand curve
for EE investments.
IV. Influence of Individual Characteristics
on their Time Preferences
Next, we examine the determinants of
individual discount rates using observable
characteristics of the head of household, the
household, and their home as predictors in a
wide array of regression specifications.7
One of the most consistent results (Table A6)
is that education matters greatly for individual
discount rates. Controlling for other factors,
individuals with some college education have
discount rates 8-9 percentage points lower, and
7
Other studies have also found that education and income have a
negative effect on discount rates (Anderson et al. 2006).

Note: See Table A1 for the variable descriptions. The number of observations in the estimation sample equals 879. Note that the econometric
analysis in Table A2 differs from Newell and Siikamäki (2014) to match the goals of this paper. First, we estimate WTP for reduced annual energy
operating cost, whereas Newell and Siikamäki (2014) estimates WTP for present value operating cost. Second, we estimate heterogeneity
associated with the characteristics of the respondent, household, and their home directly as a determinant of WTP for annual operating cost
savings, whereas Newell and Siikamäki (2014) considers those variables as determinants of heterogeneous marginal utility of income (interact
them with purchase price). Third, here we exclude treatments 3, 8, and 11 in Newell and Siikamäki (2014) as not directly relevant for the
estimation of WTP for annual operating cost savings. Constant in this model denotes the coefficient on “any economic information” as a label
attribute in Newell and Siikamäki (2014), as all treatments in the analysis include at least some economic information.

Survey questions and response alternatives used to directly elicit data on payback time and WTP for energy
efficiency. This section was placed after the choice experiments in the survey instrument. We use the midpoint of
the categorical responses to create a continuous variable for estimation.
Paying for Energy Savings
Energy efficient water heaters use less energy to operate. They typically are relatively more costly at the time of purchase, but
help reduce household’s long-run energy bill. Whether choosing an energy-efficient water heater makes sense depends on the
household, how costly the water heater is, and how large energy savings it can provide over time. People also have different
views regarding how quickly their spending on energy-efficiency improvements should pay back in reduced energy bill. Many
factors, such as life situation, income, and personal preference and judgment, influence such views, and rightfully so.
11. Consider purchasing a water heater. In your situation and view, how quickly should a more energy-efficient alternative
recover its additional purchase expense in energy savings? (Check the longest amount of time it can take to recover the
additional purchase price for you to still be happy with purchasing an energy efficient model.)
