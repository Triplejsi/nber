ABSTRACT
I use a quantitative economic geography model to explore subsidy competition among U.S. states.
I ask what motivates state governments to subsidize firm relocations and quantify how strong their
incentives are. I also characterize fully non-cooperative and cooperative subsidy choices and assess
how far away we are from these extremes. I find that states have strong incentives to subsidize firm
relocations in order to gain at the expense of other states. I also find that observed subsidies are closer
to cooperative than non-cooperative subsidies but the potential losses from an escalation of subsidy
competition are large.

Introduction

U.S. state and local governments spend substantial resources on subsidies competing for mobile
…rms. According to a database from the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research,
the costs of such subsidies have more than tripled since 1990 reaching a total of $45 billion in
2015. This …gure is equivalent to around 30 percent of state and local business tax revenue and
adds up all subsidies that are commonly available to medium and medium-large …rms. They
include property tax abatements, customized job training subsidies, investment tax credits,
and research and development tax credits, among other things.1
In this paper, I provide a …rst comprehensive quantitative analysis of this subsidy competition in the U.S.. I …rst ask what motivates governments to subsidize …rm relocations
and quantify how strong their incentives are. I then characterize fully non-cooperative and
cooperative subsidy choices and assess how far away we are from these extremes. By doing so,
I aim to make sense of a widely used policy intervention and inform the surrounding policy
debate.
I pursue this analysis in the context of a quantitative economic geography model which I
calibrate to U.S. states. In‡uenced by the trade policy literature, I calculate optimal subsidies,
Nash subsidies, and cooperative subsidies and then compare them to observed subsidies.
Optimal subsidies are the subsidies states would o¤er if they did not have to fear any retaliation
and shed light on the incentives states have. Nash subsidies and cooperative subsidies then
characterize the fully non-cooperative and cooperative subsidy choices thereby capturing the
worst-case and best-case scenarios.
I …nd that states have strong incentives to subsidize …rm relocations in order to gain at
the expense of other states. Optimal subsidies average $14.9 billion, would raise real income
by an average 2.2 percent in the subsidy imposing state, and would lower real income by an
average -0.2 percent in all other states. I also …nd that observed subsidies are much closer
to cooperative than non-cooperative subsidies but that the potential costs of an escalation
of subsidy competition are large. In particular, moving from observed subsidies to Nash

The database is called Panel Database on Business Incentives and it is documented in Bartik (2017).
Earlier estimates put the annual subsidy costs at $46.8 billion in 2005 (Thomas, 2011) and $80.4 billion in
2012 (Story et al., 2012).

subsidies would cost on average -1.1 percent of real income while moving to cooperative (i.e.
zero) subsidies would only improve welfare minimally.
The key mechanism in my analysis is an agglomeration externality in the New Economic
Geography tradition which derives from an interaction of internal increasing returns and
trade costs. In particular, consumers bene…t from being close to …rms because this gives
them access to cheaper …nal goods. Similarly, …rms bene…t from being close to …rms because
this gives them access to cheaper intermediate goods. By subsidizing …rm relocations, states
try to foster local agglomeration at the expense of other states so that their subsidies are
beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
In my quanti…cation, I try to strike a balance between transparency and realism to be
able to clearly illustrate the main mechanisms and yet obtain broadly credible quantitative
results. Analytical results are notoriously hard to derive in economic geography models so
that the quantitative analysis is also meant to convey more fundamental conceptual points.
While this means that I have to make compromises, it strikes me as a natural approach in
this case, which certainly goes well beyond the arbitrary numerical examples that have long
dominated the economic geography literature.
I am not aware of any comparable analysis of non-cooperative and cooperative policy
equilibria in a spatial environment. Most closely related is, perhaps, the recent work by
Fajgelbaum et al (2016) who use a quantitative economic geography model to study state
taxes as a source of spatial misallocation in the United States. However, they only consider
the implications of exogenous changes in state taxes and do not attempt to solve for noncooperative or cooperative policy equilibria. The same basic point applies to well-known
earlier contributions to the quantitative place-based policy literature such as Gaubert (2014)
and Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016).2
The optimal subsidy argument I develop in the paper builds on the insight of Venables
(1987) that governments have an incentive to exploit the agglomeration economies backward
and forward linkages bring about. I have already explored the implications of it for tari¤ wars
2

Gaubert (2014) quanti…es the aggregate e¤ects of subsidies given by the national government to lagging
regions in France. Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016) estimate the incidence of state corporate taxes on the
welfare of workers, landowners, and …rms in the U.S.. See also Greenstone et al (2010) and Kline and Moretti
(2014) for related empirical analyses.

in a series of earlier papers (Ossa, 2011; Ossa, 2012; Ossa, 2014) and also draw on some of the
methods I developed there. Having said this, there are some fundamental di¤erences between
tari¤ wars and subsidy wars. The most striking one is that subsidy wars can potentially
improve overall welfare because the local spillovers which make subsidy wars tempting also
bring about allocative ine¢ ciencies which subsidies can correct.3,4
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, I lay out the theoretical framework describing the basic setup, the equilibrium for given subsidies, the general
equilibrium e¤ects of subsidy changes, and the agglomeration and dispersion forces at work.
In section 3, I turn to the calibration, explaining how I choose the model parameters, what
adjustments I make to the model, and how I deal with possible multiplicity. In section 4, I
perform the main analysis, exploring the welfare e¤ects of subsidies, optimal subsidies, Nash
subsidies, and cooperative subsidies.

Framework

The theoretical framework is in the New Economic Geography tradition of Krugman (1991)
and Krugman and Venables (1995). It emphasizes agglomeration economies resulting from
forward and backward linkages which arise endogenously from the interaction of …rm-level
increasing returns, transport costs, and factor mobility. The main intuition is that workers
want to be close to …rms and …rms want to be close to …rms in order to have cheaper access
to goods for …nal and intermediate use. These agglomeration economies have a beggar-thyneighbor character which is what governments then exploit.
This formulation of agglomeration economies has a number of attractive features, as discussed extensively in the related literature. For example, Fujita et al (2001) emphasize that it
does not simply assume agglomeration economies with reference to imprecise notions such as
3

As I discuss in detail later on, the abovementioned -1.1 percent real income losses associated with an
escalation of subsidy competition are calculated relative to a benchmark in which all allocative ine¢ ciencies
are eliminated by the federal government. Absent this intervention, a subsidy war would actually increase real
incomes in all states.
4
My analysis is also related to the tax competition literature following Oates (1972) which emphasizes …scal
externalities. The main di¤erence is that in my model governments do not want to attract …rms for …scal
reasons but because they generate local spillover e¤ects. Having said this, Baldwin et al (2005) analyze tax
competition in a range of stylized New Economic Geography models which also feature some of the mechanism
I emphasize.

4

localized spillover e¤ects but actually derives them as an endogenous model outcome. Also,
empirical studies such as Handbury and Weinstein (2015) provide direct evidence supporting
its underlying mechanism by showing that larger regions tend to have lower variety-adjusted
price indices.
Having said this, this New Economic Geography model has an isomorphic external increasing returns representation as one might suspect from the work of Allen and Arkolakis
(2014). In particular, it can also be interpreted as a perfectly competitive Armington (1969)
model with factor mobility in which local productivity is simply assumed to be increasing
in local economic activity. In that sense, it can really capture all of the famous Marshallian
agglomeration forces deriving from specialized inputs, thick labor markets, and technological
spillovers.

2.1

Basic setup

The country is populated by workers who can freely move across regions. They consume
…nal goods and residential land and have location preferences which have an idiosyncratic
component. Goods are produced by an endogenous number of monopolistically competitive
…rms from labor, capital, commercial land, and intermediate goods. Capital is freely mobile
across regions, land can be freely put to residential or commercial use, and input-output
linkages are of the roundabout form. The total supply of labor and capital is …xed at the
national level and the total supply of land is …xed at the regional level.
2.1.1

where Uj is its common and ujv is its idiosyncratic component. Uj aggregates amenities
Aj , residential land TjR , and …nal goods consumption CjF in a Cobb-Couglas fashion with
a land-expenditure-share

. The formula is divided by the local number of workers Lj to

express everything in per-capita terms. CjF is a CES aggregate of Mi di¤erentiated varieties
from each of the R regions with an elasticity of substitution " > 1. ujv is drawn from a
Frechet distribution in an iid fashion and

is an inverse measure of the dispersion of workers’

idiosyncratic location preferences.
While I include land purely for quantitative realism, the idiosyncratic location preferences
play a more central role. In particular, they ensure that the common component of utility does
not necessarily equalize across space thereby introducing a meaningful sense in which regions
can bene…t at the expense of other regions. Together, these two ingredients also give rise to the
two main congestion forces in the model, namely rising land prices and deteriorating workerregion preference mismatch. As we will see, this mismatch also has interesting implications
for the welfare e¤ects of interregional transfer payments.

express everything in per-…rm terms. CjI is the same CES aggregate over individual varieties
as CjF above.
6

Having multiple factors with varying amounts of e¤ective mobility is important for my
results.5 As I will describe in more detail shortly, local governments provide subsidies to
local …rms which they …nance through local labor taxes. For such subsidies to a¤ect the
location of economic activity, it is important that there is a more mobile factor than the one
that gets taxed. As is easy to show, they would do nothing but raise the before-tax wage
by the amount of the tax/subsidy if labor was the only factor of production, thereby leaving
incentives completely unchanged.
2.1.3

Government

I distinguish between a non-cooperative and a cooperative policy regime. In the non-cooperative
regime, local governments choose local subsidies to maximize local expected utility, which can
be written as E (Ujv j living in j). In the cooperative regime, the federal government chooses
all subsidies to maximize national expected utility, which is given by E (maxj fUjv g). National
expected utility is de…ned as the expected value of the maximum of all local utilities since
workers are freely mobile across regions and choose whichever one o¤ers them the highest
utility.
Since subsidy changes induce workers to re-optimize their location choices, local expected
utility can in principle be de…ned over the set of ex-ante or ex-post local residents. I adopt
the ex-ante de…nition in most of what follows because it strikes me as the more natural
one. The most obvious reason is that local policy changes get voted on by current and not
future residents of the location. Moreover, we will see that this assumption implies that local
governments act (almost) as if they maximized local employment which resonates nicely with
the rhetoric of real world policy debates.
While I am therefore quite comfortable with this assumption, I also want to be clear that
it is not an innocuous one. In particular, it is easy to verify that the local expected utility of
ex-post local residents is actually equalized across locations and equal to the national expected
utility. This implies that local governments would simply maximize national welfare if they
maximized the expected utility of ex-post local residents in which case there would no longer
5

While labor is freely mobile across regions, the idiosyncratic location preferences act like a mobility cost.
Hence, capital is e¤ectively the most mobile factor in this environment, followed by labor and then land.

7

be any meaningful di¤erence between the non-cooperative regime and the cooperative regime.
Formally, maximizing the local expected utility of ex-ante local residents is equivalent to
maximizing the common component of local utility, Uj . Using the properties of the Frechet
distribution, it is easy to show that maximizing the expected utility of national residents is
1
PR
equivalent to maximizing
U
. With that in mind, I will refer to changes in Uj as
i=1 i
changes in local welfare and changes in

1

PR

i=1 Ui

as changes in national welfare in the

following. For future reference, I summarize the objective functions of the local and federal
governments as:

X

Gf ed =

i=1

(3)
Ui

!1

To preempt any confusion, let me reiterate that Uj is just amenity adjusted per-capita
consumption. As we will see shortly, this then implies that Uj also corresponds to amenity
adjusted per-capita real income. For given amenities, local welfare changes can therefore also
be interpreted as local per-capita consumption or real income changes. As a result, I use the
expressions changes in local welfare, changes in local per-capital consumption, and changes in
local per-capita real income interchangeably in the following when discussing the local welfare
e¤ects of subsidies.
In practice, local governments make use of a wide array of subsidy measures to provide
business incentives to local …rms. These include property tax abatements, customized job
training subsidies, investment tax credits, research and development tax credits, deal-closing
programs, and so on. I do not attempt to directly model all these di¤erent policy measures
but focus instead on their common e¤ect on business costs. In particular, I simply assume
that regional governments o¤er subsidies to all local …rms which pay for a fraction of their
overall …xed and variable costs.
This simpli…cation helps me keep the analysis transparent and ensures I model subsidies
in a way that is compatible with the aforementioned W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment
Research business incentive database. As I will describe in more detail in the data section,

8

this is the best available database on local business incentives which I use to calibrate the
subsidies local governments provide. It aims to measure the "standard deal" available to most
medium and medium-large businesses and reports local business incentives as a fraction of
local value added.
I interpret these subsidies as deviations from bene…t tax rates, i.e. taxes for which …rms
receive public goods of equal value in return. This allows me to abstract from business taxation
and public good provision altogether which further simpli…es the analysis. I implement this
simpli…cation by interpreting statutory business taxes as bene…t taxes which do not a¤ect the
location decisions of …rms. While this at …rst looks like a strong assumption, we will see that
all results are surprisingly robust to measurement error in the subsidy variable which is where
the mistake would show up.
In the end, the only taxes I have in the model are therefore the taxes collected to …nance
the subsidies. I assume that these taxes are levied on local residents in a lump-sum fashion
since they would ultimately have to pay for any shortfall between the revenues from taxes
collected from local businesses and the expenditures on public good provision to local businesses. Denoting the proportional subsidy on business costs by si , the wage rate by wi , the
interest rate by i, the land rental rate by ri , and local expenditures on intermediates by EiI ,
the local tax bill is given by:
Si = si wi Li + iKi + ri TiC + EiI

2.1.4

Budget constraint

Local residents earn local labor income wi Li , local land income ri Ti , and a share of national
capital income

L
i iK.

L
i

Li =L is simply the share of workers residing in region i so that

each worker is assumed to own an equal share of the nation’s capital stock. They use this
income for their expenditures on …nal goods EiF , residential land ri TiR , and taxes Si , as well
P
as an interregional transfer i which satis…es R
i=1 i = 0. This transfer helps rationalize
inter-regional trade imbalances and captures side payments in the cooperative regime. Their

9

budget constraint is therefore given by:
L
i iK

wi Li +

+ ri Ti = EiF + ri TiR + Si +

i

(5)

In particular, it is easy to show that a region’s aggregate net exports are given by N Xi =
K
i
i

L
i

iK +

i,

where

K
i

Ki =K is the share of capital employed in region i. As a result,

can be calibrated to ensure that the predicted N Xi matches the data, as is commonly done

in the trade literature. The term

K
i

L
i

iK arises because of the earlier assumption that

each worker owns an equal share of the nation’s capital stock. It implies that there is a
di¤erence between the capital income generated by local …rms and the one accruing to local
residents whenever

K
i

6=

L
i

which is then mirrored in net exports.

Building on this intuition, Caliendo et al (2014) have recently suggested an alternative
way of dealing with aggregate trade imbalances. In particular, they do not assume that each
worker owns an equal share of the nation’s capital stock but instead make workers’ asset
holdings dependent on their state of residence. For example, workers in Florida are assumed
to own a larger share of the nation’s assets which then allows them to …nance their state’s
trade de…cit. The authors show that one can calibrate state-speci…c ownership shares in that
manner to largely explain the observed trade de…cits.
While I am sympathetic to this idea, I believe it is not well suited for my application
because it implies that workers’ asset holdings change whenever they switch locations. For
example, workers would then bene…t from moving to Florida simply because this would give
them a larger share in the nation’s asset holdings which would clearly distort my policy
analysis. In any case, it would also be just a patch for the more fundamental problem that
it is hard to rationalize aggregate trade imbalances in static models since they are ultimately
driven by intertemporal savings and investment decisions.

2.2

Equilibrium in levels

To set the stage for my analysis of non-cooperative and cooperative subsidies, I begin by
characterizing the equilibrium for given subsidies. In this equilibrium, workers maximize
utility, …rms maximize pro…ts, free entry ensures zero pro…ts, and all goods and factor markets

10

This says that equations (6) - (9) can be reduced to a system of 4R equations in the 4R
unknowns Pi ,

L

and

by substituting equations (10) - (19). In particular, equations

and parameters which can then be substituted to eliminate those variables

from equations (6) - (9). While this is easy to do, the resulting reduced-form equations
become rather cumbersome so that it makes more sense to discuss their underlying intuitions
by considering the more transparent building blocks (6) - (19).
Equation (6) follows from the fact that prob (Uiv

from the

properties of the Frechet distribution, as is also well known from the discrete choice literature.
It simply captures that better regions attract more workers, where "better" refers to the
common component of utility. This relationship is the stronger the higher is
high

, because a

corresponds to a low dispersion in idiosyncratic utilities. This equation also reveals

that maximizing Ui is similar to maximizing local employment as already mentioned earlier,
at least if R is su¢ ciently large.
Equations (7) - (9) require less of an explanation, as they are simply a CES price index,
a zero-pro…t condition, and a land market clearing condition, respectively, with pij denoting
the delivered price of a good from region i in region j and

i

1

si . In particular, the CES

price index takes the standard form, the zero pro…t condition requires that operating pro…ts
equal subsidized …xed costs, and the land market clearing condition imposes that the total
land income in region i is equal to the sum of residential and commercial land expenditure in
region i.
The intuitions underlying equations (10) - (13) should also be fairly clear. In particular,
equations (10) - (12) follow directly from the nested Cobb-Douglas structure of the production
function which implies that …rms spend a share
their costs on capital, a share

T

L

of their costs on labor, a share

of their costs on commercial land, and a share 1

K

of

of their

costs on intermediates. Moreover, equation (13) captures that prices are constant markups

12

over subsidized marginal costs, where
ij

ij

> 1 is an iceberg transport cost in the sense that

units need to be shipped from i for 1 unit to arrive in j.
Equation (14) is a compact version of the earlier equation (4) which summarizes subsidy

costs. It is obtained by substituting equations (10) - (12) into equation (4) after rewriting
equations (10) - (11) in terms of wi Li and ri TiC which requires using the earlier de…nitions
L
i

=

L,

K

and

T

It says that local subsidy costs are increasing in the local

subsidy rate and the share of capital employed locally which e¤ectively serves as a proxy for
the size of the subsidized local economy since the local uses of labor, capital, commercial land,
and intermediate inputs comove.
Equations (15) - (17) calculate transfers as well as …nal and overall expenditure on goods.
Equation (15) is simply a rearranged version of the earlier relationship N Xi =
i,

K
i

L
i

iK +

where N Xi is set to match the aggregate net exports of region i. Equation (16) follows

from the budget constraint (5) and the fact that consumers spend a share 1

of their

income on goods and the remainder on residential land. Equation (17) simply says that total
expenditure on goods consists of expenditure on …nal goods by consumers and intermediate
goods by …rms.
This leaves me with equations (18) and (19) to explain. Equation (18) is simply amenity
adjusted per-capita real income since
goods and (ri ) (Pi )1

EiF is total expenditure on residential land and …nal

2.3

Equilibrium in changes

Before using this system of equations to analyze non-cooperative and cooperative subsidies, it
is convenient to …rst express it in changes following Dekle et al’s (2007) "exact hat algebra".
This technique is now standard in the quantitative trade literature and has also been applied
recently in economic geography settings (see, for example, Redding 2016). Here, the main
advantage is that it eliminates the need to explicitly estimate the technology parameters 'i
13

and fi , the preference parameters Ai , and the trade cost parameters

ij ,

thereby very much

simplifying the quantitative analysis. In particular:

Isomorphism

Building on Allen and Arkolakis (2014), I show in Appendix 1 that the model can also be
interpreted as an Armington model with external increasing returns to scale. In particular,
suppose instead that each region makes one di¤erentiated variety under conditions of perfect
competition subject to the aggregate production function Qi = 'i (Zi )1+ , where outputs,
Qi , and inputs, Zi , are now represented in capital letters to emphasize that they refer to
aggregate quantities.

i

> 0 is an external increasing returns parameter which captures that

local productivity is increasing in local employment.
Keeping the rest of the model unmodi…ed, I show in the appendix that such an Armington
model is isomorphic to the above New Economic Geography model under the assumption
that

= 1= ("

1). Intuitively, the local price index is decreasing in local employment in

both models, with the mechanism operating through changes in variety in the New Economic
Geography model and through changes in productivity in the Armington model. I exploit this
feature to assess how robust my results are to my particular model speci…cation by allowing
for

. I obtain this information from the 2007 Commodity

Flow Survey, the 2007 Annual Survey of Manufacturing, the business incentive databases of
Bartik (2017) and Story et al (2012), the 2007 BEA Input-Output Table and BLS Capital
Income Table, as well as work by Redding (2016) and Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016).
I construct the matrix of interstate trade ‡ows from the Commodity Flow Survey scaled
to match state-level manufacturing production from the Annual Survey of Manufacturing.
Using the publicly available Commodity Flow Survey data, I begin by constructing a matrix
of interstate freight shipments. I use the reported values which aggregate over all modes of
transport and all included industries in order to avoid having to deal with the many missing
values there are at …ner levels of detail. In the end, there are still about 8 percent missing
values, all pertaining to interstate rather than intrastate ‡ows.
I interpolate these missing interstate ‡ows using the standard gravity equation my model
implies: Xij = Mi (pii

ij )

1 "

(Pj )"

1

Ej . In particular, I estimate this equation by regressing

log trade ‡ows on origin …xed e¤ects, destination …xed e¤ects, and standard proxies for trade
costs, namely log distance between state capitals and a dummy for whether i and j share a
state border. Reassuringly, the estimation delivers a positive common border coe¢ cient and
a plausible distance elasticity of trade ‡ows of -1.01. The correlation between predicted values
and observed values is 96 percent.
I then scale these freight shipments to ensure they add up to the total manufacturing
shipments reported in the Annual Survey of Manufacturing for each state. On average, the
total freight shipments implied by the Commodity Flow Survey are almost 2.5 times larger
than the total manufacturing shipments reported in the Annual Survey of Manufacturing.7
However, notice that trade shares and not trade ‡ows enter into equations (20) - (43) used
to calculate the e¤ects of subsidy changes so that these scalings only matter if they a¤ect
di¤erent states di¤erentially.
I obtain the vector of labor shares

L
i

from the Annual Survey of Manufacturing. In

particular, I simply calculate the total number of U.S. manufacturing workers and determine
7

In part, this simply re‡ects the fact that the aggregate freight shipments I use from the Commodity Flow
Survey include all goods captured by the Standard Classi…cation of Transported Goods which includes not
just manufacturing goods. However, the Commodity Flow Survey also double-counts trade ‡ows if they are
shipped indirectly, say …rst from i to m and then from m to j.

17

the share of those employed in a particular state. These shares range from 0.03 percent for
Wyoming to 10.98 percent for California and their distribution is as one would expect. In
particular, manufacturing is mainly concentrated in California, Texas, and the traditional
manufacturing belt states stretching all the way from New York to Illinois. Also, there is
generally little manufacturing activity in the Interior West of the country.
I obtain most of my subsidy measures from a new Panel Database on Business Incentives
from the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. This database is the best available
database on local business incentives and is documented in detail in Bartik (2017). It aims
to measure the "standard deal" available to most medium and medium-large businesses and
reports local business incentives as a fraction of local value added. It mainly includes property
tax abatements, customized job training subsidies, investment tax credits, and research and
development tax credits.
As my subsidy measure I use the …rm-age weighted average of the present value of business incentives available to manufacturing …rms in 2007. This average is calculated by …rst
simulating the present value of business incentives available to new …rms over a 20-year time
period and then adjusting the starting years to match the …rm age distribution in 2007. This
measure is readily available from the database and strikes me as the most reasonable one
for my purposes since I cannot capture the time pro…le of business incentives in my static
environment.
I supplement the information available from the Panel Database on Business Incentives
with information available from the New York Times’Business Incentive Database compiled
by Story et al (2012). This is necessary because the Panel Database on Business Incentives
currently covers only 32 states plus the District of Columbia in an e¤ort to economize on
resources. However, the missing 14 states only account for less than 10 percent of all U.S.
private sector GDP so that the gap in the Panel Database on Business Incentives is smaller
than it …rst seems.
In contrast to the Panel Database on Business Incentives, the New York Times’ Business Incentive Database does not attempt to back out the "standard deal" available to most
businesses but simply reports an estimate of the total annual value of all business incentives
including sales tax abatements, property tax abatements, corporate tax abatements, cash
18

grants, loans, and free services. I correct for this discrepancy by scaling the entire New York
Times data such that it lines up with the Panel Database on Business Incentives for the 32
states included in both datasets.
Unfortunately, the value of subsidies going to manufacturing …rms is not straightforward to
determine in the New York Times’Business Incentive Database since many incentive programs
are not classi…ed by industry. To obtain at least a rough estimate, I take the value of subsidies
going explicitly to manufacturing (around 32 percent), disregard all subsidies going explicitly
to agriculture, oil, gas and mining, and …lm and allocate the residual (about 53 percent) to
manufacturing based on manufacturing shares in state GDP obtained from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis.
In order to bring these subsidy measures in line with their representation in the theory, I
express them as a fraction of total revenues which is the same as total costs since free entry
is assumed to drive pro…ts down to zero. The resulting subsidy rates do not exhibit any clear
geographic pattern and average 0.5 percent nationwide. New Mexico (3.8 percent), Vermont
(3.2 percent), and Oklahoma (2.5 percent) are the three most generous states while Colorado
(0.0 percent), Arkansas (0.0 percent), and Delaware (0.0 percent) are the three least generous
states.
I estimate the shares of labor, capital, and land in value added from the 2007 input-output
tables of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In particular, I calculate the share of labor in
value added as the share of employee compensation in value added net of taxes. I then divide
the residual into the capital share and the land share by using the shares of equipment,
intellectual property, and inventories in all assets and the share of structures and land in all
assets from the 2007 capital income tables of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Aggregating
over all manufacturing industries, I …nd

L

= 0:57,

K

= 0:33, and

T

= 0:10.

I use the same input-output tables to calculate the share of value added in gross production. In doing so, I have to recognize that my model does not directly map into published
input-output tables for two reasons. First, I do not have any investment in my model while
the published input-output tables distinguish between purchases which are depreciated immediately and purchases which are capitalized on the balance sheet. Second, I only have
manufacturing industries in my model while the published input-output tables encompass the
19

entire economy.
I deal with the …rst issue by scaling all rows in the main body of the use table by one plus
the ratio of private …xed investment to total intermediates. By doing so, I e¤ectively treat all
purchases …rms make as intermediate consumption which matters mostly for durable goods
industries such as machinery. Otherwise, I would essentially assume that …rms do not value
cheap access to machinery only because they capitalize them on their balance sheets. I deal
with the second issue by simply cropping the input-output table to include only manufacturing
industries. Using this procedure, I …nd

= 0:58.

I take the remaining parameters , , and " from the literature. I particular, I set

= 0:25

following Redding (2016) who bases his choice on housing expenditure shares documented by
Davis and Ortalo-Magne (2011). Moreover, I set

= 1:2 as in Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016)

who estimate it by exploiting the fact that it also represents a local labor supply elasticity.
Finally, I pick a value of " = 5 which represents a typical estimate from the trade literature.
Needless to say, the estimates of

and " have to be handled with particular caution so I also

provide extensive sensitivity checks.

3.2

Adjustments

As laid out so far, the framework has two debatable implications which I will now discuss.
First, subsidies can have an e¢ ciency enhancing e¤ect in addition to their main beggar-thyneighbor e¤ect since goods prices are too high relative to land and factor prices as a result
of a markup distortion. Second, subsidies can have a second beggar-thy-neighbor e¤ect in
addition to their main agglomeration e¤ect since they also bring about an interregional wealth
redistribution by a¤ecting the real value of the nominal transfers which were introduced to
rationalize aggregate trade de…cits.
It is not clear how to best deal with the issue that subsidies can have an e¢ ciency enhancing
e¤ect. Essentially, one can either eliminate the markup distortion or embrace it as a central
feature of the economic environment. The former approach can be justi…ed by arguing that
the markup distortion is just one of many distortions a¤ecting real-world economies and
therefore should not be overemphasized. The latter approach can be defended by pointing
out that the markup distortion is not just any distortion but one that is intimately related to
20

the agglomeration externality.
The intimate relationship between the allocative ine¢ ciency and the agglomeration externality is particularly clear in the isomorphic external increasing returns to scale representation
introduced above. In this representation, the external increasing returns not only allow regions to gain at the expense of one another but also imply that goods are underprovided
due to a wedge between private and social marginal costs. This implies that the same local
spillovers which make subsidies beggar-thy neighbor policies also bring about the allocative
ine¢ ciency which subsidies can correct.
In light of this, I report results following both approaches so that readers can make their
own choice. In particular, I extend the model by allowing for a federal cost subsidy …nanced
by lump-sum taxes on all national residents. This federal subsidy is set to exactly neutralize
the markup distortion so that state subsidies then have no additional e¢ ciency enhancing
e¤ect (the details can be found in Appendix 2). When I discuss my …ndings, I always start
by considering the case with such a federal subsidy and then ask how the results change if it
is removed.
The prediction that subsidies also bring about an interregional wealth redistribution strikes
me as collateral damage from a modeling patch. The issue is simply that the nominal transfer
is evaluated in real terms in the indirect utility function so that

j

j

Pj

is what governments

care about. One implication of this is that governments then have an incentive to manipulate relative prices such that the real value of the transfer they make (receive) is minimized
(maximized). Unfortunately, this incentive is strong enough to severely contaminate the
quantitative results given the large trade imbalances in the dataset.
In order to avoid this problem, I follow my approach in Ossa (2014) and …rst use the
model to purge the trade data from the interregional transfers and then work with the purged
data subsequently. Notice that this could be done by setting

^ ij = M

However, I use a slightly modi…ed version of the model in an attempt to minimize the di¤erence
between the purged data and the original data. In particular, I treat

L

as exogenous by

L
setting ^ i = 1 and dropping equation (20).8
8

Another advantage of purging the data from interregional transfers is that I do not have to take a stance

21

This procedure does not a¤ect the pattern of interregional trade ‡ows with the correlation
between original and purged data being 99.1 percent. It also does not a¤ect the cross-regional
distribution of capital with the correlation between original and purged capital shares
being 99.9 percent (recall that the labor shares

L

(2007), the main e¤ect is that the prices of …xed factors rise (fall) in regions running trade

range from -18.1 percent in Montana to 6.0

percent in Wisconsin and are between -5.5 percent and 6.0 percent for 44 out of 48 states.

3.3

Multiplicity

As is usually the case in New Economic Geography models, there are multiple equilibria if the
agglomeration forces are su¢ ciently strong relative to the dispersion forces. Concretely, this
L
K
C
means that equations (20) - (43) can have solutions other than P^i = ^ i = ^ i = ^ i = 1 for

factual subsidies, which is always an equilibrium by construction because it corresponds to the
factual situation. Multiple equilibria are more likely the higher is

since location preferences

are then less dispersed. Multiple equilibria are also more likely the lower is " since consumers
and …rms then care more about being close to …rms.
Figure 1 illustrates the structure of equilibria in the calibrated model for various values of
and ". This …gure is constructed by checking if equations (20) - (43) converge to di¤erent
solutions for a large sequence of random starting guesses over a …ne grid of values for
and ". As can be seen, my benchmark values

= 1:2 and " = 5 are safely within the

region in which there is a unique equilibrium. The same is true for all values within the
ranges

2 [0:8; 1:6] and " 2 [4; 6] which I work with in sensitivity checks (labelled "range of

considered parameters" in the …gure).

3.4

Model …t

Model …t is typically not discussed in papers using Dekle et al’s (2007) "exact hat algebra"
method since the model perfectly …ts the data used in the calibration by construction. This is
no di¤erent in my application, where the method essentially imposes a restriction on the set
on the units in which they are held …xed. This would raise serious interpretational issues which are usually
ignored in the quantitative trade literature.

for all i and j. In particular, it is then possible to "invert" the model and back out relative
trade costs, amenities, productivities, and many other variables which seems useful to get
a sense of the parameter variation needed to explain the observed economic geography. As
I discuss in more detail in Appendix 3, the variation in trade ‡ows is mainly explained by
variation in trade costs which are highly correlated with distance. Moreover, the variation in
manufacturing employment is mainly explained by variation in amenities with Wyoming and
California having the worst and best amenities, respectively.

Analysis

4.1

Welfare e¤ects of subsidies

Figure 2 summarizes what happens if Illinois unilaterally deviates from its factual subsidy
indicated by the vertical line. The top panel depicts Illinois’local welfare change as well as
the average of the local welfare changes of all other states. The center panel shows the change
in the number of …rms in Illinois as well as the average of the changes in the number of …rms
in all other states. The bottom panel summarizes the e¤ects on the shares of labor and capital
employed in Illinois. As can be seen, higher subsidies allow Illinois to gain at the expense of
other states and attract …rms, labor, and capital to Illinois.9
These local welfare changes are driven by a combination of home market e¤ects, terms-oftrade e¤ects, and congestion e¤ects. Essentially, Illinois gains by attracting economic activity
from other states because this reduces Illinois’ price index and improves Illinois’ terms-oftrade. These gains are attenuated by competition for Illinois’…xed factor land which drives
up Illinois’land rental rates and subjects Illinois’…rms to diminishing returns. This can be
9

I started this project when I was still at the University of Chicago which is why I always use Illinois as an
example. There is nothing special about Illinois and I could have used any other state.

The …rst term captures a home market e¤ect which is also sometimes referred to as …rm
relocation or …rm delocation e¤ect. In particular, Illinois’ subsidy induces some …rms to
relocate to Illinois from other states. This has two con‡icting e¤ects on Illinois’price index
since Illinois’consumers now have access to more domestic varieties but fewer foreign varieties.
However, Illinois’consumers gain more from the increase in the number of domestic varieties
than they lose from the decrease in the number of foreign varieties since they spend more on
domestic varieties because of trade costs.
The second term captures a terms-of-trade e¤ect. In particular, the relocation of economic
activity to Illinois increases labor and land demand in Illinois relative to other states so that
Illinois’wage and land rental rates increase relative to other states. Given that wage and land
rental rate changes directly translate into price changes in this constant markup environment,
this then increases the prices of goods Illinois exports to other states relative to the prices
of goods Illinois imports from other states which amounts to an improvement in Illinois’
terms-of-trade.
While these relative wage and relative rent e¤ects are the dominant e¤ects on Illinois’
terms-of-trade, two additional e¤ects need to be taken into account. In particular, there is
an adverse direct subsidy e¤ect which arises because Illinois’ subsidies directly reduce the
price of goods made in Illinois. Also, there is an adverse intermediate cost e¤ect which arises
because production relocations to Illinois reduce the price index of intermediate goods in

The third and fourth terms in equation (44) capture residential and commercial congestion
e¤ects, respectively. Residential congestion arises if local workers consume less residential land
relative to …nal goods which happens if local land rental rates rise relative to the local goods
price index. Commercial congestion arises if local …rms run into diminishing returns by using
less commercial land per worker which happens if local land rental rates rise faster than local
wages. The latter point follows from the fact that

which should be

straightforward to verify.
As an illustration, I have used formula (44) to decompose the e¤ects of a 5 percent subsidy
imposed by Illinois. Illinois’ welfare goes up by 1.2 percent of which 1.6 percent are due to
home market e¤ects, 1.0 percent are due to terms-of-trade e¤ects, and -1.4 percent are due
to congestion e¤ects. The terms-of-trade e¤ect consists of relative wage, relative rent, direct
subsidy, and intermediate cost e¤ects of 5.4 percent, 0.5 percent, -4.5 percent, and -0.3 percent,
respectively. The congestion e¤ect consists of residential and commercial congestion e¤ects of
-2.3 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.10

4.2

Optimal subsidies

I now compute the optimal subsidies of all 48 states, assuming each time that all other states
do not deviate from their factual subsidies. The goal is to quantify how much states could gain
from unilateral policy interventions and set the stage for the subsequent analysis of subsidy
wars. As I describe in detail in Appendix 4, I compute optimal subsidies by maximizing Gloc
j
as de…ned in equation (3) using the Su and Judd (2012) method of mathematical programming
10
I have scaled all e¤ects from decomposition (44) so that they sum to the welfare e¤ects computed using
the system of equilibrium conditions. This is necessary because equation (44) is just a linear approximation
for discrete subsidy changes which ignores second-order distortions to expenditure shares.

25

with equilibrium constraints. This ensures fast convergence despite the high dimensionality
of the analysis.
Figure 3 summarizes the optimal subsidies of all 48 states. As can be seen, they range
from 5.8 percent for Tennessee to 12.2 percent in Louisiana and are strongly related to states’
own trade shares. The own trade share is an inverse measure of a state’s trade openness
calculated as the share of purchases it makes from itself. The variation in the own trade
shares is mainly driven by variation in trade costs even though state size of course also plays
a role. For example, California has by far the highest own trade share and also by far the
largest manufacturing employment share.
The tight optimal subsidy-own trade share relationship can be explained with reference to
the home market e¤ect which is the dominant e¤ect throughout the analysis. In particular,
recall that consumers gain more from the larger number of domestic …rms than they lose from
the smaller number of foreign …rms because they spend more on domestic varieties than on
foreign varieties. The own trade share essentially quanti…es how much more they spend on
domestic varieties than on foreign varieties and therefore determines how much they gain from
attracting …rms.
Figure 4 turns to the local welfare e¤ects associated with the optimal subsidies from Figure
3. As can be seen, they range from 0.2 percent for New Mexico to 4.6 percent for California
and are strongly increasing in states’optimal subsidies. Recall from above that New Mexico,
Vermont, and Oklahoma have the highest factual subsidy rates in my sample which explains
why they appear as an outlier in Figure 4. In particular, all welfare e¤ects are measured
relative to factual subsidies and not zero subsidies and these three states are already closer
to their optimal subsidies in the baseline case.
Figure 5 con…rms the earlier claim that optimal subsidies are very close to employmentmaximizing subsidies. One way to interpret this is that the results are robust to governments
maximizing local employment instead of local welfare. Another way to interpret this is that
local employment maximization is a good rule of thumb for local welfare maximization. Either
way, it is a comforting …nding since local jobs feature most prominently in real-world policy
debates. It arises simply because workers move to the states which are most attractive as

Figure 6 illustrates the geographic propagation of the local welfare e¤ects of optimal
subsides using again the example of Illinois. It shows that most of Illinois’neighbors actually
gain from Illinois’optimal subsidies with the losses arising in more distant states. The reason
is simply that Illinois’neighbors trade a lot with Illinois and can therefore reap some of the
bene…ts of Illinois’increased product variety. While this may be obvious in the context of this
model, it does not always seem to be appreciated by real world policymakers who sometimes
worry particularly about subsidies imposed by neighboring states.
Table 1 expands on the results from Figures 3 and 4 listing the optimal subsidies together
with their welfare e¤ects. It reports the optimal subsidies as well as the local welfare gains of
the subsidy imposing state (under "own"), the average local welfare losses in all other states
(under "other"), and the national welfare loss (under "national"). The optimal subsidies and
local welfare e¤ects are also reported in dollar terms, where the dollar values are calculated
by multiplying subsidy rates with subsidy bases and percentage local welfare changes with
local per-capita …nal expenditures.11
Optimal subsidies average 9.6 percent or $14.9 billion, would raise local welfare by an
average 2.2 percent or $1.2 billion in the subsidy imposing state, and would lower local welfare
by an average -0.2 percent or -$2.9 billion in all other states. Notice that the dollar gains
of the subsidy imposing state are always smaller than the dollar losses of all other states
combined which suggests that subsidies are an ine¢ cient beggar-thy-neighbor policy. This is
then also corroborated by the national welfare e¤ects in Table 1 which are all negative and
average -0.07 percent.
Table 2 shows the results of four sensitivity checks. Panel A reports the sensitivity of the
results to the value of

e¤ects are strongly decreasing in " which makes sense since " is also an inverse measure of the
agglomeration externality. This perhaps most obvious in the isomorphic external increasing
returns model introduced earlier in which

= 1= ("

1) parametrizes the strength of the

external increasing returns.
Panel C turns to the sensitivity of varying

in the external increasing returns model now

keeping " unchanged. In this case, the New Economic Geography model and the external
increasing returns model are no longer isomorphic so that we can assess what role the particular model speci…cation plays. To make Panels A and B comparable, I calculate the range of
in Panel C by applying the formula

= 1= ("

1) to the range of " in Panel B. As can be

seen, the optimal subsidies and their welfare e¤ects are again strongly increasing in , now
even more so than implicit in Panel B.
Panel D suggests that measurement error in my subsidy dataset would only have minimal
e¤ects on the results. This is important since I interpret subsidies as deviations from bene…t
tax rates in the theory which does not map exactly into the measured subsidy rates. In
particular, Panel D shows the maximum and minimum optimal subsidies I obtain in 1,000
calculations in which I replace the measured subsidy rates with a bootstrap sample. These
maximum and minimum values are very similar in all cases which implies that the optimal
subsidies do not depend much on the measured subsidies.
Figures 7 and 8 explore the e¤ects of removing the federal subsidy which was imposed
to correct for the markup distortion so far. As can be seen, the optimal subsidies become a
bit larger and their "own" welfare e¤ects become a bit smaller while their overall pattern is
preserved. On average, the optimal subsidy is 10.1 percent with "own" and "other" welfare
e¤ects of 1.5 percent and -0.03 percent, respectively. As I discussed earlier, state subsidies then
also have an e¢ ciency enhancing character in addition to their beggar-thy-neighbor character
because they counteract the markups charged by …rms.
28

4.3

Nash subsidies

I now turn to the best-response equilibrium in which all states retaliate optimally. This is
meant to capture the extreme case of fully non-cooperative policy making which I will also
refer to as a subsidy war. As I explain in detail in Appendix 4, it can be found by iterating
over the algorithm used to compute optimal subsidies until a …xed point is reached. I have
experimented extensively with this procedure and it appears that the …xed point is unique.
To avoid confusion, I call the resulting best-response subsidies Nash subsidies and continue
using the term optimal subsidies as before.
Figure 9 plots the Nash subsidies against the optimal subsidies from Figure 3. As can
be seen, the Nash subsidies tend to be slightly lower than the optimal subsidies but the
overall correlation is very high. Intuitively, optimal subsidies are higher than Nash subsidies
because states’own trade shares respond more to optimal subsidies than to Nash subsidies.
In particular, states attract more …rms if other states do not retaliate which then induces
them to spend more on domestic goods. This, in turn, magni…es states’incentives to impose
further subsidies following the logic discussed above.
Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the local welfare e¤ects associated with these Nash subsidies.
As can be seen, they range from -3.1 percent for Delaware to 2.3 percent in Montana so that
not all states lose from a subsidy war. The welfare gains are decreasing in states’capital-labor
ratios since subsidies are …nanced by workers but cover labor and capital costs. As a result,
per-capita taxes are higher in capital abundant states which results in lower per-capita real
incomes there. At the same time, subsidies are no longer e¤ective at inducing …rm relocations
because they are o¤ered everywhere.
Table 3 elaborates on these …gures analogously to Table 1. Of course, there is now only
one set of Nash subsidies instead of 48 sets of optimal subsidies so that there is no distinction
between "own" and "other" welfare e¤ects. On average, Nash subsidies are 9.1 percent or
$9.9 billion and bring about local welfare losses of -1.1 percent or -$0.6 billion. These local
welfare losses add up to -$30.9 billion across the entire country and the national welfare loss
is -1.3 percent. All in all, a full-out escalation of subsidy competition would therefore have
large negative welfare e¤ects.

29

Table 4 considers the sensitivity of these …ndings analogously to Table 2. In particular,
its various panels again report the e¤ects of changing the parameters

, ", and

in the

New Economic Geography or external increasing returns version of the model as well as the
minimum and maximum Nash subsidies obtained when by replacing the subsidy data with
a bootstrap sample 1,000 times. Just as in the case of optimal subsidies, the Nash subsidy
results are very robust to changes in

or measurement error in the subsidy data but strongly

respond to changes in " and .
Figures 12 and 13 explore the e¤ects of removing the federal subsidy analogously to Figures
7 and 8. While the Nash subsidies are again rather similar with and without the federal
subsidy, it turns out that a subsidy war bene…ts all states without the federal subsidy. As
should be clear by now, the reason is that the state subsidies counteract the markup distortion
which consumers of intermediate and …nal goods otherwise face. Essentially, states then
unintentionally improve the e¢ ciency of the national economy as their attempts to attract
…rms from each other more or less cancel out.
My assessment of the welfare e¤ects of subsidy wars therefore critically depends on whether
or not I start from a …rst-best or a laissez-faire benchmark. As I explained earlier, there are
good reasons for making either comparison so that I hesitate to take a strong stance. What
is clear, however, is that subsidy wars at best move the economy in the right direction and
are not a substitute for …rst-best policies. This is also why I emphasize the case with federal
subsidies in most of the paper because I do not want to mislead the reader into endorsing
distortionary policies.

4.4

Cooperative subsidies

I now consider cooperative subsidy policy leaving behind the best-response logic from the
subsidy war. The goal is to characterize the best-case scenario and assess how much there is
to gain relative to the status quo. I assume that the federal government sets state subsidies
as well as interstate transfers

j

with the objective of maximizing national welfare. As I

explain in detail in Appendix 4, I again use the Su and Judd (2012) method of mathematical
programming with equilibrium constraints which ensures fast convergence despite the high
dimensionality of the analysis.
30

As one would expect, the cooperative state subsidies are zero or such that prices get
reduced by the extent of the markup, depending on whether or not the federal government
already corrects for the markup distortion with a federal subsidy. In this case, there is no
meaningful distinction between either scenario because a common federal subsidy or uniform
state subsidies achieve exactly the same policy goal. As is illustrated in Figure 14, the
interstate transfers are used to redistribute per capita income with the result of reducing but
not eliminating interstate inequality.
This redistribution improves national welfare by allowing more workers to live in states
that better match their idiosyncratic preferences. In particular, some workers in richer states
are attracted purely by better consumption possibilities in the sense that their ujv ’s are
actually higher for poorer states. Transfers from richer to poorer states allow some of these
workers to relocate to states for which they have higher ujv ’s thereby improving the average
match quality. At the same time, there is still inequality in the cooperative equilibrium since
transfers come at the cost of reducing production e¢ ciency.12
Starting at factual subsidies, cooperation would increase national welfare by 0.5 percent.
Almost the entire e¤ect is due to the use of transfers, setting subsidies to zero alone only
brings about a welfare gain of 0.002 percent. From a welfare perspective, factual subsidies
are therefore much closer to the best-case scenario than the worst-case scenario (recall that
the national welfare loss of moving to Nash subsidies is 1.3 percent). Table 5 provides more
detail on these numbers which Table 6 complements with sensitivity checks analogous to the
earlier Tables 1-4.13
Figure 15 compares non-cooperative and cooperative subsidies to factual subsidies. The
light grey lines represent non-cooperative subsidies at various degrees of escalation. In particular, the top grey line shows the fully non-cooperative subsidies while the bottom grey
line (the x-axis) shows the fully cooperative subsidies and the intermediate grey lines show
12
If I did not allow the federal government to set interstate transfers, it would attempt to achieve a similar
redistribution by manipulating the terms-of-trade using state subsidies. In particular, it would set higher
subsidies in poorer states than in richer states thereby improving the terms-of-trade of poorer states relative
to richer states.
13
I do not report the sensitivity of cooperative subsidies with respect to initial subsidies because cooperative
subsidies are always zero anyway. Careful readers might notice that there are minor deviations from zero in
two of the reported sensitivity checks (for
= 1 and
= 0:20) which I believe are due to computational
imprecisions.

31

proportionately scaled versions with the scalings decreasing in 10 percentage point steps. The
factual subsidies are superimposed onto this using state labels and states are always sorted in
increasing order of their non-cooperative subsidies.
With the exception of a few outliers, factual subsidies are much closer to cooperative than
non-cooperative subsidies. This is not surprising since one would not expect U.S. states to be
in a fully escalated subsidy war. Besides perhaps engaging in tacit cooperation, U.S. states also
act in the shadow of the federal government which might try to restrict subsidy competition
if it became too extreme. For example, the federal government could adopt the argument of
some legal scholars that state incentive programs violate the constitution’s Commerce Clause
because they discriminate against out-of-state businesses.14
Figure 16 compares (log) subsidy costs in the factual equilibrium to (log) subsidy costs
in the Nash equilibrium. It shows that states with higher factual subsidies also tend to have
higher Nash subsidies, which is less apparent when subsidies are expressed as percentage
rates in Figure 15. While this is an encouraging observation, it clearly has to be taken with
a large grain of salt. Most importantly, the factual subsidy costs I measure are likely to
be incomplete and imprecise proxies for the business incentives state governments actually
provide, as I discussed in the data section above.
Brushing measurement concerns aside for a moment, one can actually make optimal subsidies line up exactly with factual subsidies by allowing state governments to be partially cooperative. In particular, suppose that state governments maximize a Cobb-Douglas combination
1

PR
j
. The
of local welfare and national welfare with local welfare weights j : (Uj )
i=1 Ui
local welfare weights listed in Table 7 then equalize optimal subsidies and factual subsidies

as is veri…ed in Figure 17. Notice that these weights are all below 1 percent suggesting again
that the factual regime is close to cooperative.15
14

More precisely, the argument refers to the "dormant" Commerce Clause which U.S. courts have inferred
from the Commerce Clause of the U.S. constitution. It holds that states are prohibited from passing legislation
which interferes with interstate commerce even if Congress does not intervene. The legal debate therefore
focuses on the question of whether state incentive programs interfere with interstate commerce. See Rogers
(2000) for an interesting overview.
15
Given the high correlation between optimal subsidies and Nash subsidies, these weights also bring Nash
subsidies close to factual subsidies.

Conclusion

In this paper, I provided a …rst comprehensive quantitative analysis of subsidy competition
in the U.S.. I …rst showed that states have strong incentives to subsidize …rm relocations in
order to gain at the expense of other states. I then showed that observed subsidies are much
closer to cooperative subsidies than non-cooperative subsidies but that the potential costs of
an escalation of subsidy competition are large.
As with all calibration studies, my quantitative results are best interpreted as rough estimates which have to be taken with a grain of salt. The reason is simply that they are obtained
from a theoretical model with numbers which abstracts from many features of reality. Having
said this, they still provide the best guess available from the academic literature to date of
the potential gains and losses from more or less subsidy competition in the U.S.. As such,
they hopefully serve as a useful input into policy discussions as well as a useful benchmark
for future academic research.
While I used my framework to study subsidy competition among regional governments,
it should be clear that it can also be applied to study subsidy competition among national
governments. In my view, this would be a valuable contribution to the international subsidy
competition/tax competition literature in that it would go beyond the usual analysis of …scal
externalities. In particular, it would make the case that national governments care about
attracting multinational …rms not only because they expand the national tax base but also
because they generate spillover e¤ects for the national economy.
