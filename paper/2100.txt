The Dividend—Price Ratio and Expectations
of Future Dividends and Discount Factors

ABSTRACT

A linearization of a rational expectations present value model for
corporate stock prices produces a simple relation between the log
dividend-price ratio and mathematical expectations of future log real
dividend changes and future real discount rates. This relation can
be tested using vector autoregressive methods. Three versions of the
linearized model, differing in the measure of discount rates, are
tested for U. S. time series 1871-1986: versions using real interest
rate data, aggregate real consumption data, and return variance data.
The results yield a metric to judge the relative importance of real
dividend growth, measured real discount rates and unexplained factors
in determining the dividend-price ratio.

What accounts for the variation through time in the dividend-price ratio
on corporate stocks? In the context of rational expectations models, the
ratio is often interpreted as reflecting changes in the outlook for
dividends: when dividends can be forecasted to decrease, the dividendprice ratio should be high. Alternatively, also in the context of a
rational expectations model, the ratio is interpreted as reflecting the
rate at which future dividends are discounted to today's price: when
discount rates are high, the dividend-price ratio is high. In principle,
the dividend-price ratio ought to have both of these interpretations at
once. Yet their relative importance has never been established, and it is
not clear whether the two interpretations together can account for time

variation in the dividend-price ratio. We attempt to answer this here
using U. S. time series data 1871 to 1986. (For data sources, see the
Appendix.)
A simple present value model for stock prices has the following form:

k

a Et E exp(- E r+.)D+k
k—O

(1)

j—O

where P is the real price per share,

is the real dividend per share,

and Et denotes expectation conditional on information publicly available at

time t. The discount rate r satisfies exp(r) a E[(Pt+1+D)/P] and may
have several interpretations. In what we will call version I of the model,

exp(r) is the ex-ante gross real interest rate on one-period debt, times a

constant reflecting a risk premium. In version II of the model, exp(-r) —

kEfi(Ct/C+l)a where

is per capita real consumption at time t, a is the

coefficient of relative risk aversion and k is a constant risk premium. In
1

version III of the model, exp(r) —

flexp(+aV),

where

is a constant

riskiess real interest rate, a is the coefficient of relative risk aversion
and Vt is the variance, conditional on information available in year t, of
the monthly stock returns in that year.
All three versions of the model can be derived, at least approximately,

from equilibrium foundations. (See the Appendix for details). Inversions
I and II, the discount rate for corporate stocks moves through time because
the riskiess real interest rate changes while the risk premium on stocks is
constant; in version III, by contrast, the riskiess real rate is constant
and the risk premium is time-varying.
The different versions of the model have been studied before, but the
present study adds some new perspectives. With regard to version I, Shiller
[1981] ,

Mankiw, Romer and Shapiro 119851 and West [1986a] , [1986b] have

asked whether the volatility of short-term interest rates might help
explain the volatility of stock market prices. Version II of the model has
been analyzed extensively, following the original theoretical work of Lucas
[1978] and Breeden [1979] ,

by Grossman and SMiler [1981] , Grossman, Melino

and Shiller [19851, Hansen and Singleton [1983], Hall [1985), Mankiw,
Rotemberg and Summers [1985] and Mehra and Prescott [19851, among others.
The goal of much of this research has been to estimate the coefficient of
relative risk aversion a, either from the cross-sectional relation between
means and covariances with consumption of different asset returns, or from
the time-series relation between forecastable returns and forecastable

consumption

growth,

or from both of these simultaneously. Estimated risk

aversion is often implausibly large, especially when cross-sectional

information is used. Version III of the model has been proposed, following

2

an exploratory analysis by Merton [1980], by Pindyck [1984], [19861 who
argues that much of the variability in stock prices can be explained by the

variability of V. Against this, Poterba and Summers [1985] have argued
that V is not persistent enough to account for much variation in stock
prices. French, Schwert and Stambaugh 11986] and Campbell [1987] examine
the relation between V and expected stock returns, but do not develop
implications for the dividend-price ratio.
The emphasis of this paper differs from that of much previous work in

the area. We are less interested in testing the model and estimating the
coefficient of risk aversion, and more interested in accounting for time

variation in the dividend price ratio. Our econometric methods reflect
this emphasis.

Linearization of the Model
Equation (1) involves an expectation of a complicated nonlinear relation

among P, D. j—0,1,... and r+ j0,l

Some form of linearization

will be necessary to pursue the implications of the model that we wish to
study. The linearization will introduce an approximation error that could
lead to a rejection of the model (1) even if it is true. However, our
purpose here is not merely to test the model (1) but to characterize in
broad terms how it succeeds and fails; for such a purpose the linearization
is useful.

One may divide both sides of (1) by Di which is in the information set
at time t, and hence can be passed through the expectations operator.

Taking logs of both sides of the equation, and using lower case letters to
denote natural logs of the corresponding upper case variables, we have:

Since we will linearize the expression, we can pass the log function inside
the expectations operator, and defining the log of the dividend price ratio

(5)

J —o

where p a exp(-(r-g)) and h — log(exp(r-g)-l)-(r-g)/(l-exp(g..r))j Thus,
the log dividend-price ratio is approximately equal to a constant plus the

"present value" of expected current and future values of the one-period
discount rate minus the one-period growth in dividends. Note that tsd+. and

rt. enter symmetrically in (5); all that matters for the dividend price
ratio is their difference. Equation (5) represents the combined effect on
the dividend-price ratio of expectations both of changes in future dividends and of future interest rates that was noted in the opening paragraph
of this paper.

1For finite price Pt r must be greater than g and p less thar. one.

The final step in deriving the linearized model is to pass the log

function through the expectations operator in the definition of r. For
example, in version II of the model r —

we use the

Since the model is now linear, and since

the rational expectation of future ex-ante discount rates equals the
rational expectation of future ex-post rates, we can use ex-post measures

of real rates in our tests. In what follows, rt will refer to the ex-post
real rate.

It's instructive to note that the linearized model (5) can also be

derived in a different way. Calling R the return to holding stock for one
period, Rt

exp(S+hd)). Linearizing this expression

Er we get a rational expectations model

In Tables la and lb we display several measures of the approximation

error for the linearized model (5). In carrying out the approximation, the
point of linearization was taken to be the log of one plus the sample
average real return on stocks, less the sample average change in log

dividends. Table la compares e

approximation error is quite small in both tables.

This terminal condition is used only for evaluating the
approximation in equation (5), and not in the empirical work reported
below.

Time Series Representations

We will study two representations of each version of the model. In
representation (a) real dividends must be differenced to induce
stationarity and in representation (b) the dividends are assumed to be
stationary around a trend. The reason for including two representations is

that evidence is mixed as regards which simple model of the processes is
most appropriate for our analysis. A Phillips-Perron [1986] test that the
dt process has a unit root rejects at the 5% level with our full sample
period in favor of an alternative that it is stationary around a trend
(Table 2). This would suggest that representation (b) is appropriate.

However, since we strongly reject the unit root hypothesis for the log
dividend-price ratio, this stationarity implies stationarity around a trend

for real price as well; yet we do not reject the unit root assumption for
price (Table 2).

These internally inconsistent test results are hard to interpret. It's
possible that the test lacks power to reject the unit root hypothesis for
stock prices because of their smoothness; it's also possible that the test

falsely rejects that hypothesis for the dividend series. The PhillipsPerron significance levels are asymptotically correct, but in any finite
sample one can add sufficient noise to a process with a unit root to obtain
a false rejection.

Time series models involving deterministic trends are currently in
disfavor; many people seem to think that they are inherently implausible.

But of course in using a deterministic trend in a model we are not
asserting that such a trend really will be followed forever. Parsimony

6

dictates that with modest data sets we keep our models simple. An AR(p)
model with a deterministic trend might be regarded as an approximation to
an ARIMA(p,1,l) model with a moving average component whose root is close
to the unit circle, a model in which distant past values are useful in
forecasting the distant future.

There is in fact a very concrete reason to consider representation (b)
or something like it as well as (a). Unless we incorporate very long lags
in the autoregressive representation for the time series, a univariate
model that represents dividends in integrated form does not allow
forecasted dividends to tend to revert back to their long-run historical
values. A short univariate autoregressive forecasting equation in the
first-difference of dividends makes forecasts of dividends in the distant
future necessarily a function of only the most recent changes of dividends.

In fact, distant dividends appear historically to be forecastable fairly
well in terms of a long average of past dividends (Shiller [1984]). Of
course, we estimate multivariate models but we want to specify these in
such a way that an adequate univariate model of dividends is contained as a
special case

3

Note that in representation (a) if Mt and r are jointly stationary
s:ochastic processes, it follows from the linearized model (4) and (5) that
-

Pt

is stationary, or equivalently, dt and Pt are cointegrated

processes. Econometric techniques have been developed for them by Phillips
and Durlauf [1985], Granger and Engle [19861 and Stock [1984]. Our model is

When we tried adding long lags to representation (a) of the models,
we got results somewhat resembling those for representation (b). This
tends to confirm our view that representation (b) may be a parsimonious way
to model "long memory" in the dividend process.

7

particularly straightforward to deal with since the cointegrating vector is
specified in the model and does not require estimation. Ordinary theory of
estimation of stationary vector autoregressions is applicable here.

VAR Test MethodoloEy
For each version and representation of the model we define a vector
in such a way that all its elements are known to the public at time t. For

version I representation (a) we define x' —

(d1

Adtl r1], where

all variables are demeaned, and in representation (b) the vector

[dt1-

x' —

1 d1, r1), where all variables are demeaned and dtl has been

detrended. We write C(L)xt —

u where the elements of C(L) are p'th-order

polynomials in the lag operator L, i.e., we assume that a p'th order vector

autoregressive representation for x exists. We rewrite the vector

Mtl + v. so that
Eztk — Akz. We define the vector el such that el'z — dtl Pt
(demeaned), the vector e2 such that e2z —
Mtl (demeaned) in
autoregressive representation in companion form

—

-

representation (a) and d1 (detrended) in representation (b), and the

vector e3 such that e3'z —

r1.

To state the restrictions of the model in terms of the vector
autoregression, we substitute (5) into (4) (disregarding the constant h)

and then replace r

.

ti-i

with

e3A3+lz

t

.

Moreover we replace M .
t+J

with

e2IAJ+lz for representation (a) and with e2(A3Ai)z for representation
(b). It follows, evaluating the infinite series, that

given

should equal 8

by:

—

((e3'

-

e2t)A+e2'B)(I_pA)z

8

(6)

where B—O in representation (a) and B — 1 in representation (b). Since the
actual dividend-price ratio is in the information set on which we are

conditioning, Sshould equal 6 exactly, except for sampling error. That
is, we do not have the usual difficulties in rational expectations models
caused by the fact that market participants may have more information than
econometricians. We can compare the history of

and S as a way of

evaluating the "fit" of the model. Equivalently, we can compare the

elements of the matrix ((e3'-e2')A+e2'B)(I-pA) on the right hand side of
(6) with el' .

Both comparisons are made in the tables below.

To write the restriction

— S in terms of model parameters, we can

in (6) with el'z1 cancel

replace

from both sides of the equation,

and postmultiply by (I-pA) to obtain:

el(I-pA) a (e3' -

e2')A

+

eVE

(7)

Tests of these restrictions on the autoregressive coefficient matrix A
using a Wald procedure are reported in the tables below. The restrictions
(7) can be interpreted as asserting that a regression of the approximate

excess return

-

rt

on information z gives z a zero coefficient, and

the Wald test in fact corresponds in the sample to a standard regression F
test of the restrictions.

It is also possible to decompose the behavior of S into two components:

a component 5 due to forecasts of change in dividends and a component
due to forecasts of real interest rates:

a

(e2'A4-e2'B)(IpA)z

(8)

a

e3'A(IpAY'z

(9)

To study version II of the model, we define in representation (a) the

vector x'— [d1 -

p,

Ad1. Aci] where all variables are demeaned and

in representation (b) the vector x— [dt1 -

t

d1, Ac11 where dtl is

also detrended4. We assume that there is a vector autoregressive

representation for x and as above write C(L)x —

where the elements of

C(L) are p'th order polynomials in the lag operator L. Rewriting the vector

autoregressive representation in companion form

Here &, as before, is the theoretical log dividend price ratio, the
optimal forecast of the present value of future dividend changes and

discount factors. As with version I, we can decompose 5 into a component
due to rational expectations of future dividend changes and a component
due to rational expectations of future discount factors.

defined as in equation (8), and 6' is defined as a times the right hand
side of equation (9).

Ac is lagged in the same way as Ad or d. The implicit assumption
here is that the consumption data for each year represent consumption on
December 31 of the year. Thus, in January of each year (the month in which
our price data are drawn) Ac
is known but Ac is not. There is no fully
-l
satisfactory way to handle te unit-averaged consumption data in the
context of a theoretical model involving point-of-time consumption data,
without going to the continuous time econometrics format, as in Grossman,
Melino and Shiller [1985] We did experiment with including current rather
than lagged Ac in the vector, and did not find qualitatively different
results.

10

We can estimate a, the coefficient of relative risk aversion, using the
restriction (11). One might at first think that a unique value for a could

be found by post-multiplying (11) by A1e3 and solving the resulting
expression for a in terms of estimated coefficients. However, the
restrictions (11) imply that A is singular. Defining e4 as the vector which
is zero except for the second element, which is one, then (pel' +

0. Our approach was instead to use a method-of-moments

estimator for a. Defining A as the vector of deviations from the

restriction (11), A —

el

(pA)'el

A'(ae3

e2),

a two-step procedure was

used. Defining the vector of parameters of the model besides a as -y,

we

minimize A(a,y)A(a,'y). The matrix C is taken as (aA/a-,eaA/a7 where a

is

the variance matrix of the parameter vector y. In step one,

evaluated at a —

was

1. In step 2, ) was evaluated at the first round estimate

of a.

The resulting estimate of a has the following interpretation. Equation
(11) asserts that the prediction at time t of the linearized return
equals (a constant plus) a times the predicted change in log consumption.
Our estimate of a is thus analogous to other estimates in the literature
that rely on making forecasted returns correspond to forecasted changes in

consumption. In Grossman and Shiller [1981] estimation of a along these
lines was suggested (in the context of a plot of stock prices and their expost rational counterpart) but the discussion was couched in levels; the

simple method used here of dealing with nonstationarity (dividing by lagged
dividend) was not used and formal estimation in such terms was not
attempted.

To study version III of the model, we define the vector x— [d1 -

11

Pt,

V1] in representation (a) and x1— [dci -

d1, Vi] in

representation (b) and proceed as with version II.

Results
For all versions of the model, the point of linearization r-g was formed
by taking the log of one plus the sample average real return on stocks and
then subtracting the sample average change in log dividends. The point of
linearization differs slightly across the versions only because the data
and/or sample period differed slightly.
Estimates of version I, representation (a) (using first-differenced
dividends) appear in Table 3a. The model is rejected at the 6.9% level.

Despite this evidence against the model,

dividend changes and there is substantial correlation of 0.773 between the
theoretical log dividend price ratio 6 and the actual dividend price ratio

correlation is substantial, the standard deviation of 6 is only 0.417

times that of

This suggests that there is an element of truth to the

model, but that the actual dividend price ratio "overreacts" to the news
about future dividends.
For comparison with results in our earlier paper (Campbell and Shiller
[1986]) which assumed constant discount factors and studied levels rather

than logs of variables, we present also a Wald test of the model in which
the time-varying discount factors are suppressed. Now the Wald test rejects

a the 0.1% level. Thus it would appear that incorporating

time-varying

discount rates helps to "save" the efficient markets model. But,
apparently it does so largely by bringing in a noisy extraneous variable to

12

destroy the power of the test. The evidence that 6 Granger causes future
real interest rates is very weak (significant at only the 15.6% level).

Allowing for time-varying interest rates greatly increases the standard
error on the correlation of

estimate. By itself,

at -0.139.

We now turn to representation (b) of version I, which uses detrended

dividends (Table 3b). Some of the results are quite different. In this
representation, the optimal forecast of the present value of future
dividends discounted at a constant rate is close to a simple trend,
reflecting the apparent sharp trend-reverting pattern of real dividends.

This means that 5 is highly correlated with the detrended dividend; it is
somewhat more variable than in representation (a) (its standard deviation

is 0.634 times that of

and has a wuch lower correlation with

(0.063). This is the kind of excess volatility" discussed in an earlier
paper by one of the authors (Shiller [l98l)).
Despite these differences, a number of results are common to

representations (a) and (b). Although the point estimates of summary
statistics look very bad in representation (b), the model is still rejected

only at the 6.0% level with the Wald test. It seems still to be the case
that the inclusion of ex-post real discount rates helps the model by adding
noise to the system; the weak relationship between the dividend-price ratio
and future real interest rates is not affected by the specification of the
dividend process.

That paper argued that the stock price displays excess volatility;
this does not necessarily imply excess volatility of the dividend-price
ratio, but it does imply a low correlation between the theoretical and
actual dividend-price ratios.
13

Plots following the tables show the actual dividend-price ratio and a
band from 2 standard errors below the theoretical dividend-price ratio to 2

standard errors above. The theoretical bands differ across representations
(a) and (b) as described above, but both representations identify the same
historical periods as unexplained by the model: the actual dividend-price
ratio was too low in the first decade of the century, too high at the end
of the First World War and at most of its subsequent peaks, and too low in
the 1960's.

The general character of the results is fairly robust to the point of
linearization. In representation (a) when the linearization parameter p —

0.900, u(6)/i(&)

equals 0.410 and the correlation coefficient cor(6,6)

equals 0.761, while when p — 0.975, a(6)/a(6) — 0.426 and cor(8,8)

—

0.791. In representation (b) when p — 0.900,
o(&)/o() — 0.601 and
cor(6,8) — 0.156, while when p — 0.975, a(8)/c(6) — 0.688 and
cor(6,8) — -0.062.
Because the period around the 1960's look particularly bad for the
model, we estimated the model using data 1871-1950 only. The general
character of the results is not very different from those reported in Table

3. In representation (a) a(&)/a(6) — 0.556 and cor(6',8) — 0.830, while
in representation (b), o'(6')/c(6) — 0.777 and cor(6,6) —

0.192.

We also made one more assessment of the approximation error of

measure of log(l +

as a

Re), this time in the context of our vector

autoregressive model. It was noted above that the Wald test of the
restrictions (7) is nothing more than a standard F test in a regresssion of
the approximate excess return

the model. In that regression, the

rt

on the right hand side variables in
equals 0.C77,

14

and the standard

deviation of the fitted value equals 0.0502. If instead the true excess

return log(l+R) -

log(l-4r)

is regressed on the same variables the

0.079 and the standard deviation of the fitted value is 0.0503. There is
virtually no difference between the results, and the correlation
coefficient between the fitted values is 0.9991.

Results for version II of the model, reported in Tables 4a and 4b, are

similar in many ways to those for version I. There is perhaps a little
encouragement for the model in that the dividend-price ratio does Cranger

cause consumption growth in both representations. However the
forecastability of consumption growth does not seem to help explain the

behavior of the dividend-price ratio. The estimated coefficient of
relative risk aversion has the wrong sign in representation (a), and has
the right sign but is insignificantly different from zero in representation

(b). The model is rejected at about the 2% level in representation (a),
and the 0.2% level in representation (b), whether or not we allow time

variation in discount rates. The estimated 6'. has a very low standard
deviation, relative to the standard deviation of

The volatility of returns variable V, in version III of the model, does
not contribute much toward interpreting actual dividend price ratios. The

actual dividend-price ratio

does not Cranger-cause V. While the risk

parameter a has the right sign, it is insignificantly different from zero.

Finally, plots for versions II and III of the model identify the same
problematic historical periods as did the plots for version I.

Conclusion
In this paper we have tried to explain time variation in corporate stock

prices relative to dividends. Our main result is a negative one: there is
very little evidence that the dividend-price ratio is driven by rational
expectations of observed ex-post one-period discount rates.
The negative conclusion holds whether we measure discount rates from
real returns on short debt, aggregate consumption growth, or the volatility

of stock returns themselves. Even the weakest implication of a timevarying discount rate model, that the dividend-price ratio should Granger
cause future ex-post discount rates, is strongly confirmed only for

consumption growth. And however we measure discount rates, the present
value of rationally expected future rates moves far too little to explain
much variation in the dividend-price ratio.

The tandard deviation of the 5, the component of the log dividendprice ratio

attributable to discount rate movements, never exceeds about

17% of the standard deviation of

itself and is never very

correlated

with it. That 8' shows so little variability is not surprising since, as
6Pindyck's analysis [1986] is in some ways similar to ours, and relies
on a linearization of the present value relation. His analysis differs from
ours in that: a. the first difference of log price rather than the log
dividend-price ratio is explained, b. pretax profits (and assumptions about
taxes and payout ratios) are employed where we used dividends, c.
univariate AR-l representations for discount factors and pretax earnings
are assumed to hold with no superior information, and d. postwar data are
employed. He provides estimates of a ranging from 3 to 5, roughly
consistent with our estimates for Version III. He does not provide measures
of the importance of V analogous to ours, except to say that V explained
about 1/3 of the market decline in 1974.
16

the tables show, the one-period discount factor measures themselves are

always much less variable than the log dividend price ratio, and always
show little persistence through time.

There is more support for the view that the dividend-price ratio

reflects rational expectations of future dividend growth. The results from
representation (a), in which the log dividend process has a unit root, are

particularly favorable to this view. In representation (a) we found substantial correlation between the log dividend-price ratio and the appropri-

ate optimal forecast of future dividends. This result is similar to one
reported in our earlier paper (Campbell and Shiller (1986]): there we found
that the spread between the long-term interest rate and the short-term
interest rate tends to be high when short rates can be forecast to
increase.

A cynical view of both these results is that they reveal nothing more
than that long rates are smoother than short rates, and stock prices are

smoother than dividends. Given this smoothness, it's not surprising that
actual spreads or ratios correlate somewhat with optimal spreads or ratios.
In the present example, the actual dividend price ratio shares the same
numerator with the theoretical dividend price ratio, and if the numerator

shows some short-run noise not In the denominators, there will be a
correlation between actual and theoretical.

However the cynical view cannot account for the finding that the

dividend-price ratio strongly Granger causes future dividends. This
finding is extremely robust to changes in lag length or time series
representation for dividends; in all models we estimated, we found Granger

causality at better than the 0.1% level. As one would expect from this

17

result, in all representations the optimal forecast of future dividend
growth, 8dt' places statistically significant weight on the actual

dividend-price ratio
Even if we reject the cynical view of our results, it is clear that
there is considerable variation in the dividend-price ratio which cannot be

accounted for by rational expectations of future dividend growth. In both
representations (a) and (b) a constant discount rate model is quite
strongly rejected, and summary statistics suggest that the actual dividend-

price ratio "moves too much". The ratio of the standard deviation of the
optimal forecast of dividend growth, to the standard deviation of the
actual dividend-price ratio, is significantly less than one at the 5% level
in all the models we estimate.

ADpendix: Sources of Data and Equilibrium Foundations of the Model

For estimation of version I of the model, the real stock price and real
dividend series are the same as in Campbell and Shiller [1986]. Pt is the
January Standard and Poor Composite Stock Price Index divided by the

Producer Price Index

(also for January starting in 1900, annual average

before that). D is the total dividends per share accruing to index for the
calendar year, divided by the annual average producer price index. The real

interest rate rt is

where ri is the

January value and r2 is the July value of the prime 4-6-month prime
commercial paper rate (6-month starting in 1979) in annual percent.
Interest rate data starting in 1938 are from the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, before 1938 from Macaulay [1938], Table 10, pp.

A142-60. The sample period for version I is 1871-1986.
For estimation of version II of the model, P and D are the same as in
version I except that they are divided by the (annual average) consumption
deflator for nondurables and services rather than by the producer price

index. C is real per capita consumption of nondurables and services. The
consumption deflator and C are defined as described in Grossman and

Shiller [1981]. The sample period is 1889-1986.
For estimation of version III of the model,

and D are the same as in

version I. We thank James Poterba and Lawrence Summers for providing us

with the same Vt series that they used in their paper [1985]; it is an
annual series with each observation consisting of the average of squared
monthly log gross returns on the Standard and Poor Composite Index for the

19

12 months of the year. The sample period is 1871-1985.

The model may be derived in general equilibrium as follows. Version
II holds in a representative agent economy when the representative

individual maximizes U —

I

+j'/(1-a) and when the conditional

covariance between real stock returns and the marginal utility ratio,

Cov((Pt+1+D)/Pfl(c/cp) is constant. The other versions of the
model can be obtained by adding assumptions to those of version II,

although they may also hold more generally. Version I holds if, in
addition to the assumptions above, the conditional covariance between the
real return on short-term debt and the marginal utility ratio is constant.
Version III is suggested by a constant relative risk aversion framework if
the expected marginal utility ratio is constant through time, generating a

constant riskless real rate p satisfying exp(-p) —
have 1 [1973] ,

Cov((P+1.fD)/P,$(C /C l° — exp(aV).
[19801

Efl(Ct/C+i)),

and if we

Following Merton

one can show that this covariance restriction holds up to a

linear approximation (it holds exactly in continuous time) if the
conditional covariance and variance are constant through time and the stock

market return is equal to the return on total invested wealth. Of course,
Version III has time-varying covariances and variances, but is suggested by
the Merton framework if changes are sufficiently slow.

Notes for Figures.
Each figure shows the demeaned log dividend-price ratio S (solid line,
labelled XDP below the figures) and a band around the theoretical demeaned

log dividend-price ratio S (dashed lines, labelled FIT+2 and FIT-2 in the

figures). S is the optimal linear forecast with information available at
time t of 6, the weighted average of future dividend changes and future
real interest rates. The upper edge of the plotted band is 2 standard
errors above S, and the lower edge is 2 standard errors below.
There are six figures, one for each version and time series

representation of the model. Representation (a) is labelled "cointegrated"
in the figures, and representation (b) is "trend-stationary".
