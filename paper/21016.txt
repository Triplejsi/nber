ABSTRACT
Value stocks are more exposed to disaster risk than growth stocks. Embedding disasters into an investment-based
asset pricing model induces strong nonlinearity in the pricing kernel. Our single-factor model reproduces
the failure of the CAPM in explaining the value premium in finite samples in which disasters are not
materialized, and its relative success in samples in which disasters are materialized. The relation between
pre-ranking market betas and average returns is flat in simulations, despite a strong positive relation
between true market betas and expected returns. Evidence in the long U.S. sample from 1926 to 2014
lends support to the model’s key predictions.

Introduction

Fama and French (FF, 1992, 1993) show that despite their similar market betas, firms with high
book-to-market equity (value firms) earn higher average stock returns than firms with low bookto-market equity (growth firms). This stylized fact is commonly referred to as the value premium
puzzle. However, consistent with Ang and Chen (2007), we show that the FF evidence is specific
to the post-1963 sample. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) captures the value premium
in the long U.S. sample from July 1926 to June 2014. The value premium is on average 0.52% per
month (t = 2.60), its CAPM alpha is 0.23% (t = 1.18), and its market beta is 0.45 (t = 3.52).
We study whether accounting for rare disasters helps explain the value premium puzzle. We embed disasters into a standard investment-based asset pricing model. Our framework features three
key ingredients: (i) severe but rare declines in aggregate consumption and productivity growth; (ii)
asymmetric adjustment costs; and (iii) recursive preferences. The single-factor model explains the
failure of the CAPM in capturing the value premium in finite samples in which disasters are not
materialized, as well as its relative success in samples in which disasters are materialized.
Intuitively, with asymmetric adjustment costs, when a disaster hits, value firms are burdened
with more unproductive capital, and find it more difficult to reduce capital than growth firms. As
such, value firms are more exposed to the disaster risk than growth firms. Combined with higher
marginal utilities of the agent in disasters, the model implies a sizeable value premium.
More important, the disaster risk induces strong nonlinearity in the pricing kernel, making the
linear CAPM a poor empirical proxy to fully capture its pricing power. In particular, when disasters
are not materialized in a finite sample, estimate market betas only measure the weak covariation
of the value-minus-growth returns with market excess returns during normal times. However, the
value premium is mainly driven by the higher exposures of value stocks to the disaster risk than
growth stocks. Consequently, the CAPM fails to explain the value premium in normal times. In
contrast, when disasters are materialized in a finite sample, the estimated market betas provide an
1

adequate account for the large covariation between the value-minus-growth returns and the pricing
kernel. As such, the CAPM captures the value premium in the sample with disasters. In all, we
provide a disaster-based explanation for the value premium puzzle.
FF (2006) refute the Ang and Chen (2007) evidence that the CAPM captures the value premium in the long sample, and argue that the CAPM’s general problem is that cross-sectional
variation in the market beta goes unrewarded. We confirm the flat relation between the market
beta and average returns, known as the beta anomaly, both in the post-1963 sample and in the long
sample. More important, we show that our single-factor model is largely consistent with the beta
“anomaly.” In simulated samples both with and without disasters, sorting on pre-ranking market
betas yields average return spreads that are small and insignificant, post-ranking beta spreads that
are significantly positive, and CAPM alpha spreads that are negative and sometimes significant.
The crux is that rolling market betas are a poor proxy for the true betas. Intuitively, based
on prior 60-month rolling windows, pre-ranking betas are average betas over the prior five years.
In contrast, true betas accurately and immediately reflect changes in aggregate and firm-specific
conditions. In simulations, true betas often mean-revert within a given rolling window, giving rise
to negative correlations with rolling betas, especially in samples without disasters.
Our work has important implications. Most important, FF’s (1992, 1993) claim of the death of
the CAPM might have been exaggerated, at least in the context of the value premium. Instead, we
lend credence to the largely overlooked work by Ang and Chen (2007). FF’s (2006) refutation of
their evidence based on pre-ranking beta sorts is suspect. Firm-level beta estimates come with a
great deal of measurement errors. We offer a fully specified model, in which rolling beta sorts yield
no average return spreads, yet the CAPM captures the value premium in time series regressions.
Building on Berk, Green, and Naik (1999), early investment-based asset pricing models reproduce the level of the value premium with only one aggregate shock (e.g., Carlson, Fisher, and
Giammarino (2004), Zhang (2005), and Cooper (2006)). However, the CAPM roughly holds in

2

these models. More recent models try to break the tight link between the pricing kernel and market excess returns by introducing multiple aggregate shocks.1 Although successful in explaining
the failure of the CAPM in the post-1963 sample, these models are at odds with the long-sample
evidence. In contrast, while retaining the single-shock structure to fit the long-sample evidence,
our model manages to fail the CAPM via disaster-induced nonlinearity.
Our work also expands the disaster literature, which uses disasters to explain asset pricing puzzles, so far mostly at the aggregate level. Barro (2006, 2009) revives the disaster explanation of the
equity premium in Rietz (1988), by calibrating the disaster model to international macroeconomic
data. Gourio (2012) embeds disasters into a production economy to jointly explain the equity premium and business cycles. Gabaix (2012) uses time-varying exposures of cash flow to disasters, and
Wachter (2013) uses time-varying disaster probability to explain time-varying risk premiums. We
integrate the disaster literature with investment-based asset pricing, and study the impact of the
disaster risk on the cross section of returns. In particular, we show how embedding disasters into a
standard investment model enables it to explain the failure of the CAPM in the post-1963 sample.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the stylized facts. Section 3
constructs the model. Section 4 contains the quantitative results. Finally, Section 5 concludes.

Stylized Facts

Table 1 reports the monthly CAPM regressions for the ten book-to-market deciles and the valueminus-growth decile in the U.S. data. The monthly returns data for the deciles, the value-weighted
market portfolio, and the one-month Treasury bill rate are from Kenneth French’s data library.
Confirming the well-known evidence reported in FF (1992, 1993), Panel A shows that the CAPM
fails to explain the value premium in the sample after July 1963. Moving from the growth decile to
the value decile, the average excess return rises from 0.42% per month to 0.93%, and the average
1

Prominent examples include short-run and long-run risks in Ai and Kiku (2013), investment-specific technological
shocks in Kogan and Papanikolaou (2013), stochastic adjustment costs in Belo, Lin and Bazdresch (2014), shocks to
financing costs in Belo, Lin, and Yang (2014), and uncertainty shocks in Koh (2014).

return spread (the value premium) is 0.51% (t = 2.75). Despite the nearly monotonic relation between book-to-market and average excess returns, the market beta is largely flat across the deciles.
The value-minus-growth decile has only a tiny market beta of 0.01 (t = 0.07). Accordingly, its
CAPM alpha is 0.51% (t = 2.26), which is identical in magnitude to the average value premium.
However, consistent with the evidence first reported (to our knowledge) in Ang and Chen (2007),
Panel B shows that the CAPM captures the value premium in the long sample from July 1926 to
June 2014. The average excess returns vary from 0.57% per month for the growth decile to 1.09%
for the value decile. The value premium is on average 0.52% (t = 2.60), which is close to that in
the post-1963 sample. More important, the CAPM captures the average value premium, with an
insignificant alpha of 0.23% (t = 1.18) and a significant market beta of 0.45 (t = 3.52). From Panel
C, the CAPM also performs well from July 1926 to June 1963. The average value premium is still
0.52% per month, albeit insignificant (t = 1.31). The market beta is large, 0.74 (t = 5.33). As
such, the CAPM alpha becomes negative, −0.11% (t = −0.34).
To shed light on the differences across the post-1963 sample and the long sample, Table 2 reports large market swings with market excess returns below 1.5 and above 98.5 percentiles of the
empirical distribution, as well as the corresponding months and the value-minus-growth returns.
There are in total 32 such observations, 24 of which are from the Great Depression. When market
excess returns are low, the value-minus-growth returns tend to be low, and when market excess
returns are high, the value-minus-growth returns tend to be high. Their correlation is 0.73 across
these observations. In particular, the lowest value premium is −22.67% in March 1938, which
comes with an abysmally low market excess return of −23.80%. The highest value premium is
69.99% in August 1932, which comes with an exuberantly high market excess return of 36.41%.
More recently, following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the market excess return is −17.23%
in October 2008, in which the value-minus-growth return is −11.93%.
Figure 1 presents the scatter plots and fitted market regression lines for the value-minus-growth

4

returns for the long sample (Panel A) and the post-1963 sample (Panel B). In Panel A, we highlight
in red the observations with monthly market excess returns below 1.5 and above 98.5 percentiles
of the empirical distribution. These observations clearly contribute to the market beta of 0.45
(t = 3.52) for the value-minus-growth decile in the long sample. In contrast, Panel B shows that
large swings in the stock market are scarce in the post-1963 sample, giving rise to a flat regression
line. In all, the CAPM does a good job in explaining the value premium in the long sample that
includes the Great Depression, but that the CAPM fails in the short post-1963 sample.
While large swings in the stock market have a large impact on the performance of the CAPM, its
relative success in the long sample is robust to extreme observations. Table 3 evaluates the robustness of the long-term performance of the CAPM to extreme observations. From Panel A, even after
we remove the observations with extreme 3% of market excess returns, the CAPM continues to do
well with an alpha of 0.17% per month (t = 0.81) and a market beta of 0.20 (t = 2.54) for the valueminus-growth decile. However, its average return, 0.30%, is only marginally significant. Removing
extreme 10% observations of market excess returns, we obtain an average value premium of 0.43%
(t = 2.72), an insignificant alpha of 0.28%, and a significant beta of 0.20. Perhaps surprisingly,
only after we remove 50% of market excess returns, do we observe a significant value-minus-growth
alpha of 0.56% (t = 2.18). The average return is 0.63% (t = 3.33), and the market beta is 0.07
(t = 0.53). The evidence suggests that the CAPM performs quite well in the long sample, and that
the Great Depression is important, with its risk priced in the value-minus-growth decile, even after
the extreme observations are removed (perhaps due to investor expectations of the disaster risk).
FF (2006) refute the evidence that the CAPM captures the value premium in the long sample
(Table 1, Panel A). FF argue that the CAPM’s problem is that cross-sectional variation in the market beta goes unrewarded. This flat relation between the market beta and average returns, known
as the beta anomaly, has a long tradition in empirical finance (e.g., Fama and MacBeth (1973), FF
(1992, 1993), and Frazzini and Pedersen (2014)). Table 4 presents evidence on this flat relation.

At the end of June of each year t, we sort all stocks into deciles based on the NYSE breakpoints
of pre-ranking betas, which are estimated from rolling-window regressions of firm-level excess returns on the market excess returns in the prior 60 months (24 months minimum). We calculate
value-weighted decile returns, and the deciles are rebalanced in June. Table 4 reports the average
returns and the CAPM regressions for the market beta deciles. The sample starts in July 1928
because we use the data from the first two years to estimate the pre-ranking betas in June of 1928.
Panel A shows that, contradicting the CAPM, the relation between the market beta and the
average return in the post-1963 sample is largely flat. Moving from the low to high beta decile, the
average excess return rises from 0.51% per month to 0.63%, and the spread of only 0.12% is within
0.5 standard errors from zero. More seriously, the pre-ranking beta sorts yield a large spread in
the post-ranking beta, 1.04 (t = 11.41), across the extreme deciles. As a result, the CAPM alpha
for the high-minus-low decile is large and negative, −0.40%, albeit insignificant (t = −1.48).
From Panel B, the evidence from the long sample seems even stronger. The average excess
return rises from 0.57% per month for the low beta decile to only 0.81% for the high beta decile.
The average return spread of 0.24% is within one standard error from zero. More important, the
post-ranking beta moves from 0.57 to 1.70, and the spread of 1.12 is more than 18 standard errors
from zero. As a result, the CAPM alpha for the high-minus-low beta decile is significantly negative,
−0.47% (t = −2.40). Panel C reports largely similar evidence for the pre-1963 sample. The average
return for the high-minus-low beta decile is 0.40% (t = 0.88), and its post-ranking beta is 1.18
(t = 16.04). The CAPM alpha is large, −0.56%, albeit only marginally significant (t = −1.94).

An Investment Model with Disasters

Our model is constructed by combining elements from the investment-based asset pricing model of
Zhang (2005) and the Rietz-Barro disasters model (e.g., Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006, 2009)). The
economy consists of a representative agent with the Epstein-Zin (1989) utility and heterogenous
firms. The firms take the representative agent’s intertemporal rate of substitution as given when
6

determining their optimal policies. The production technology is subject to both aggregate and
firm-specific shocks. The aggregate shock contains a disaster state as well as a recovery state.

3.1

Consumption Dynamics
The log consumption growth, denoted gct ≡ log(Ct /Ct−1 ) is specified as:
gct = g + gt ,

(3)

in which gt follows a first-order autoregressive process per Mehra and Prescott (1985). Specifically,
gt+1 = ρg gt + σ g ǫt+1 ,

(4)

in which ǫt+1 is a standard normal shock, and the unconditional mean of gt is zero.
After calibrating the parameter values of ρg and σ g to the consumption growth data in normal
times (Section 4.1), we use the Rouwenhorst (1995) procedure to discretize gt into a grid with five
values {g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 , g5 }. The discretization also produces a transition matrix, P⋆ , given by:

in which pij , for i, j = 1, . . . , 5, is the probability of gt+1 = gj conditional on gt = gi .
To incorporate disaster risk into the model, we modify directly the discretized gt grid and its
transition matrix, following Danthine and Donaldson (1999). Specifically, we insert into the gt grid
a disaster state, g0 = λD , in which λD < 0 is the disaster size, as well as a recovery state, g6 = λR ,
in which λR > 0 is the recovery size. Accordingly, we form the transition matrix, P , by modifying
P⋆ to incorporate the disaster and recovery states as follows:

In the modified transition matrix, η is the probability of entering the disaster state from any of
the normal states, and θ is the probability of remaining in the disaster state next period conditional
on the economy being in the disaster state in the current period. As such, θ is the persistence of
the disaster state. Similarly, ν is the persistence of the recovery state. In addition, in constructing
the transition matrix, we have implicitly assumed that the economy can only enter the recovery
state following a disaster. Once in the recovery state, the economy can enter any of the normal
states with an equal probability, (1 − ν)/5, but cannot fall immediately back into the disaster state.
Finally, it should be emphasized that our model retains only one aggregate state, gt , in the economy.

3.2

Firms

The economy is also populated by heterogeneous firms, indexed by i.

8

Production
Firms produce output with capital, and are subject to both aggregate and firm-specific shocks.
Operating profits, Πit ≡ Π(Kit , Zit , Xt ), for firm i are given by:
Πit = (Xt Zit )1−ξ Kitξ − f Kit ,

(7)

in which ξ > 0 is the curvature parameter, Xt is the aggregate productivity, Zit is the firm-specific
productivity, and Kit is capital. The fixed costs of production are f Kit , with f > 0, and are scaled
by capital to ensure that these costs do not become trivially small along the balanced growth path.
The aggregate productivity growth, gxt ≡ log(Xt /Xt−1 ), is linked to the consumption growth:
gxt = g + φgt ,

(8)

in which φ > 0. The firm-specific productivity for firm i, Zit , has a transition function given by:
zit+1 = (1 − ρz )z + ρz zit + σ z eit+1 ,

(9)

in which zit ≡ log Zit , z is the unconditional mean of zit common to all firms, and eit+1 is an
independently and identically distributed standard normal shock. We assume that eit+1 and ejt+1
are uncorrelated for any i 6= j, and ǫt+1 and eit+1 are uncorrelated for all i.
Adjustment Costs
Let Iit denote firm i’s investment at time t. Capital accumulates as follows:
Kit+1 = Iit + (1 − δ)Kit ,

(10)

in which δ is the rate of depreciation. Capital investment entails asymmetric adjustment costs:

Φit ≡ Φ(Iit , Kit ) =

(11)

in which a− > a+ > 0 and c− > c+ > 0 capture the nonconvex adjustment costs.
Value Maximization
Upon observing current period productivity levels Xt and Zit , firm i makes optimal investment
decision, Iit , and optimal exit decision, χit , to maximize its market value of equity. Let Dit ≡
Πit − Iit − Φ(Iit , Kit ) denote dividends. The cum-dividend market value of equity, Vit , is given by:
Vit ≡ V (Kit , Zit , Xt ) = max
{χit }





max Dit + Et [Mt+1 V (Kit+1 , Xt+1 , Zit+1 )] , sKit ,
{Iit }

(12)

in which s > 0 is the liquidation value parameter, subject to the capital accumulation equation (10).
When Vit ≥ sKit , which is the exit threshold, firm i does not exit from the economy,
i.e., χit = 0.

For incumbent firms that remain in the economy, evaluating the value func-

tion at the optimum yields Vit = Dit + Et [Mt+1 Vit+1 ]. Equivalently, Et [Mt+1 Rit+1 ] = 1, in
which Rit+1 ≡ Vit+1 /(Vit − Dit ) is the stock return, and Et [Rit+1 ] = rf t + β M
it λM t , in which
S
rf t ≡ 1/Et [Mt+1 ] is the real interest rate, β M
i ≡ −Cov t [rit+1 , Mt+1 ]/Vart [Mt+1 ] is the true beta,

and λM t ≡ Vart [Mt+1 ]/Et [Mt+1 ] is the price of risk.
When Vit < sKit , firm i exits from the economy at the beginning of time t, i.e., χit = 1. We set
its stock return from the beginning of period t − 1 to the beginning of t, Rit , to be a predetermined
delisting return. Shumway (1997) shows that the average delisting return is −30% for stocks on
New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange. Shumway and Warther (1999) show
that the average delisting return is −55% for stocks on National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations. We set the delisting return to be −42.5%, which is the average estimate.
When firm i exits from the economy at the beginning of time t, we assume that it enters an
immediate reorganization process. The current shareholders of the firm receive sKit as the liquidation value and leaves, and the old firm ceases to exit. New shareholders take over the remainder of
the firm’s capital, (1 − s − κ)Kit , in which κ ∈ (0, 1 − s) is the reorganization cost parameter. For
simplicity, we assume that the reorganization process occurs instantaneously. At the beginning of
10

t, the old firm is replaced by a new firm with an initial capital of (1− s − κ)Kit owned by new shareholders. The new firm draws a firm-specific log productivity, zit , from its unconditional distribution,
p
which is normal with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of σ z / 1 − ρ2z . For computational

tractability, our modeling of entry and exit keeps the number of firms constant in the economy.

Quantitative Results

We calibrate the model in Section 4.1, present the results on the CAPM in Section 4.2, discuss the
key intuition in Section 4.3, conduct comparative statics on the CAPM performance in Section 4.4,
and examine the model’s implications on the beta anomaly in Section 4.5.

4.1

Calibration

We calibrate the model in monthly frequency. Table 5 reports the parameter values for the benchmark calibration. For the preference parameters, we set the intertemporal elasticity of substitution,
ψ, to be 1.5 as in Bansal and Yaron (2004). The relative risk aversion, γ, is five. The time discount
factor, ι, is set to be 0.99035 to generate an average risk free rate about 1.8% per annum.
For the parameters that govern the consumption dynamics in normal times, we set the average
growth rate, g, to be 0.019/12, the persistence ρg = 0.6, and the conditional volatility σ g = 0.0025 to
be consistent with the data of per capita real consumption (nondurables and services) growth from
1947 to 2013.2 The implied consumption growth volatility is 1.43% per annum in simulated quarterly data, and is not far from 1.02% in the real data. In simulated annual data, the consumption
growth volatility is 1.7%, which is not far from 1.25% in the real data.3 The first-order autocorrelation is 0.49 in simulated quarterly data and 0.26 in simulated annual data. While the former is
higher than 0.30 in the real quarterly data, the latter is lower than 0.49 in the real annual data.
For the parameters that govern the disaster dynamics, we set the disaster persistence, θ = 0.97,
2

The quarterly and annual consumption data are from National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) Table 7.1.
We have also experimented with an alternative estimation, in which the consumption growth volatility is 1.8%
per annum from 1947 to 2013 in the real data. In this calculation, we scale nondurables and services from NIPA Table
1.1.5 by the consumer price index from Bureau of Labor Statistics and then by population from NIPA Table 7.1.

which is the probability that the economy remains in the disaster state in the next month conditional on it being in the disaster state in the current month. This monthly persistence accords
with the quarterly persistence of 0.973 = 0.914 in Gourio (2012). As such, the average duration
of disasters is 1/(1 − 0.97) = 33 months (roughly three years), consistent with the evidence in
Barro and Ursua (2008). We set the disaster probability η to be 0.028/12, which implies an annual
disaster probability of 2.8% estimated in Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro and Ursua (2013). Gourio
uses a quarterly disaster probability of 0.72%, also consistent with an annual probability of 2.8%.
We still have three disaster parameters remaining, including the disaster size, λD , the recovery
size, λR , and the recovery persistence, ν. We experiment with different values so that the impulse
response of log consumption to a disaster shock in the model mimics that in the real data (e.g., Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro and Ursua (2013)). This procedure yields λD = −0.0275, λR = 0.0325, and
ν = 0.95. Figure 4 reports that the model’s impulse response is roughly comparable with that in the
data. In particular, the maximum short-term effect of disasters in the model is a fall of about 23% in
log consumption, which is somewhat smaller than 29% in the data reported by Nakamura et al. (Table 2). The log-term negative effect is 15% fall in log consumption, which is close to 14% in the data.
The remaining parameters govern the various technologies in the economy. We set the curvature
parameter in the production function, ξ = 0.65, which is close to the estimate of Hennessy and
Whited (2007). The monthly depreciation rate, δ, is 0.01, which implies an annual rate of 12% as
estimated by Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006). The persistence, ρz , and conditional volatility, σ z , of
the firm-specific productivity are set to be 0.985 and 0.5, respectively, which are somewhat larger
than the corresponding values in Zhang (2005) after adjusting for the curvature parameter ξ. We
do so to enlarge the cross-sectional dispersion of firms. The long-run mean of log firm-specific productivity, z̄, is −9.75, so that the long-run average detrended capital is around unity in simulations.
We set the liquidation parameter, s = 0, meaning that shareholders receive nothing in the
event of bankruptcy. The reorganizational cost parameter, κ, is 0.25. The leverage for the aggre-

12

gate productivity, φ, is set to be unity to generate an annual output growth volatility of 2.43% in
normal times. This volatility is close to 2.30% in the data, in which output is the per capita real
gross domestic product from 1947 to 2013 (NIPA Table 7.1). Finally, we set the adjustment cost
parameters a+ = 0.035, a− = 0.05, c+ = 75, c− = 150, and the fixed costs parameter, f = 0.005.
Because of the lack of direct evidence on their values, we calibrate these parameters to match the
properties of the book-to-market deciles. Section 4.4 contains extensive comparative statics on the
quantitative impact of these parameter values on our key results.

4.2

Explaining the Performance of the CAPM

We simulate 2,000 artificial samples from the model, each with 5,000 firms and 1, 500 months. We
start each simulation by setting the initial capital stocks of all firms at unity and by drawing their
firm-specific productivity from the unconditional distribution of Zit . We drop the first 444 months
to neutralize the impact of the initial condition. The remaining 1, 056 months of simulated data are
treated as those from the economy’s stationary distribution. The sample size is comparable to the
period from July 1926 to June 2014 in the real data (Table 1). We calculate the model moments
on each artificial sample and report cross-simulation averaged results.
Table 6 reports the model’s key results under the benchmark calibration. Panel A shows the
CAPM regressions for ten book-to-market deciles in the samples with at least one disaster episode
(1,847 out of 2,000 samples). The average returns of the deciles increase with book-to-market from
0.74% per month for the growth decile to 1.19% for the value decile. The average value-minusgrowth return is 0.45% per month, which is not far from 0.52% in the data (Table 1, Panel A). However, despite the lower value premium in the model, its t-statistic is 5.83, which is more than twice
as large as 2.60 in the data. As such, the volatility of the value-minus-growth returns in the model is
less than one half of that in the data. Similarly, the t-statistics for the individual deciles in the model
are more than three times larger than those in the data. As such, stock return volatilities in our
model are lower than those in the data, in line with the aggregate-level results in Barro (2006, 2009).

13

The CAPM holds in the model’s artificial samples with disasters. The value-minus-growth alpha
is −0.21% (t = −1.72), and its 95% confidence interval across simulations spans from −0.46% to
0.06%. Accordingly, the market beta is estimated to be 0.82 (t = 6.82). The beta also aligns monotonically with book-to-market, rising from 0.82 for the growth decile to 1.64 for the value decile.
Panel B reports the CAPM regressions for the book-to-market deciles in the samples without
disasters (153 out of 2,000 samples). The average returns continue to align monotonically with
book-to-market, going from 0.77% per month to 1.21%. The average return of the value-minusgrowth decile, 0.45% per month, is identical to that from the disaster samples. More important,
Panel B shows that the CAPM fails badly in the no-disaster samples. The CAPM regression of the
value-minus-growth decile yields an alpha of 0.47% (t = 3.71). The 95% confidence interval for the
alpha spans from 0.22% to 0.75%. In addition, the market beta for the value-minus-growth decile is
insignificantly negative, −0.03 (t = −0.24). Finally, the R2 is in effect zero. In all, the quantitative
results in Table 6 on the CAPM regressions are largely aligned with the evidence in Table 1.

4.3

Inspecting the Mechanism

What is the driving force behind the quantitative results in Table 6? To shed light on this important issue, we first show that value stocks are more exposed to disaster risk than growth stocks. We
then illustrate how the disaster risk is reflected in the CAPM regressions of the value-minus-growth
returns. Finally, we examine how the disaster risk induces strong nonlinearity in the pricing kernel.
The Impact of Disaster Risk on Firm-level Risk and Risk Premiums
We characterize the impact of disaster risk using the model’s solution and impulse responses. First,
b it -gt -zit grid to plot the true beta, β M
we use the model’s solution on the K
it , and the expected risk
b it , and the log firm-specific productivity,
premium, Et [Rit+1 ] − rf t , against the detrended capital, K

zit . To examine the impact of disaster risk, we make the plots for two values of the detrended
consumption growth, gt , including the disaster state, λD , and the mean of normal states (zero).

14

Panel A in Figure 3 shows that in disasters, low-z firms, which tend to be value firms, are
substantially riskier than high-z firms, which tend to be growth firms. The mechanism is similar in
nature to, but more powerful quantitatively than that in Zhang (2005) and Cooper (2006). Briefly,
because of asymmetric adjustment costs, value firms are burdened with more unproductive capital,
finding it more difficult to downsize than growth firms. As such, value firms are riskier than growth
firms in bad times. While prior studies describe the working of the mechanism in recessions, Panel
A extends the mechanism to rare disasters. Accordingly, Panel B shows that low-z firms charge
substantially higher risk premiums than high-z firms in the disaster state.
In contrast, Panels C and D show that risk and risk premiums are largely flat across firms in the
normal states. When the overall economy is doing fine, even low-z value firms do not have strong
incentives to disinvest. As such, the mechanism of asymmetric adjustment costs fails to take strong
effect, giving rise to weak spreads in risk and risk premiums across firms. Also, in each panel,
b it -zit grid is plotted. This missing region is where firms exit the economy.

of production are proportional to capital, high-K
b than growth firms.
In simulations, value firms tend to have lower z but higher K

We also quantify the impact of disaster via impulse responses. We simulate the economy for

150,000 months, a period that contains slightly more than 300 disaster episodes. An episode starts
with the economy switching from a normal state to the disaster state, and ends with it switching
from the recovery state to a normal state. We trace the responses in risk and risk premiums for 25
years after an initial disaster shock, and calculate the average responses across the disaster episodes.
Figure 4 reports the mean responses for the value decile, the growth decile, and the averages
across all ten book-to-market deciles. From Panel A, the true value beta jumps up by 0.37, and the
true growth beta up by almost 0.20, in response to a disaster shock. To get a sense of the magnitude,
the long-term average is around 0.04 for the value beta and 0.02 for the growth beta. As such, disas-

15

ters cause an enormous jump in risk, more so for value than for growth firms. Accordingly, Panel B
shows that in response to a disaster shock, the expected risk premium of the value decile jumps up
by more than 400% over the subsequent two years, and that of the growth decile up by almost 100%
over the same period. Again, to get a sense of the magnitude, the long-term average is about 15%
per annum for the value decile and 9% for the growth decile. In all, consistent with the evidence in
Section 2, our model implies that value stocks are more exposed to disaster risk than growth stocks.
Nonlinearity in the CAPM Regressions
The disaster risk has important implications on the CAPM regressions. Figure 5 reports the scatter plots for the CAPM regressions of the value-minus-growth decile. Panel A is the scatter plot
from stacking the simulated data for all the 1,847 out of 2,000 artificial samples (the same samples
used in Table 6) with at least one disaster episode. Panel B is the scatter plot from stacking the
simulated data for the remaining 153 samples without disasters.
The basic patterns mimic those in Figure 1 based on the long U.S. sample. From Panel A of
Figure 5, the value premium covaries strongly with market excess returns in disaster samples. Both
returns are large and negative in disasters, and large and positive in the subsequent recoveries. As
a result, the market beta for the value-minus-growth decile is 0.86, which is a population moment
because of the large number of simulations. However, the CAPM alpha is −0.24% per month,
meaning that the CAPM does not hold exactly in our dynamic single-factor model, even though
the CAPM alpha is insignificant in finite samples (Table 6, Panel A).
In contrast, Panel B of Figure 5 shows that the value premium does not covary at all with
market excess returns in artificial samples with no disasters. Without the large swings in the same
direction in the value premium and market excess returns in disasters as well as in subsequent
recoveries, the CAPM regression line of the value premium is flat. As population moments, the
market beta is in effect zero, and the CAPM alpha is 0.45% per month. This simulation result
reproduces the U.S. evidence from 1963 to 2014 (Figure 1, Panel B).

16

Nonlinearity in the Pricing Kernel
The disaster risk induces strong nonlinearity in the pricing kernel, nonlinearity which in turn implies
that the CAPM is a poor proxy of the pricing kernel. If the CAPM holds exactly, the pricing kernel
can be expressed as a linear function of the market excess return, RM t+1 , i.e., Mt+1 = l0 + l1 RM t+1 ,
in which l0 and l1 are constants (e.g., Cochrane (2005)). Panels C and D of Figure 5 show that the
pricing kernel in the model is far from a linear function of the market excess return.
In particular, Panel C reports the scatter plot for regressing the pricing kernel on the market
excess return based on the disaster samples. (The results from all the 2,000 artificial samples are
quantitatively similar.) The regression yields a slope of −0.35 but an R2 of only 25%, despite the
model’s single-factor structure. The linear CAPM fits poorly the observations from the disaster
state, with very high realizations of the pricing kernel (marginal utilities), and the observations
from the recovery state, with very low realizations of the pricing kernel. Panel D shows that the
CAPM is an even worse proxy for the pricing kernel in the samples without disasters. The slope
from regressing the pricing kernel on the market excess return is only −0.03, falling in magnitude
from −0.35 from the disaster samples. The R2 also drops from 25% to 11%.

4.4

Comparative Statics

To gain further insights into the working of the key mechanism, we conduct comparative static
experiments on a wide array of parameters. We group the parameters into three categories: (i)
disaster dynamics: the disaster size, λD , the disaster persistence, θ, the disaster probability, η, the
recovery persistence, ν, and the recovery size, ν; (ii) technology: the adjustment costs parameters,
a+ , a− , c+ , and c− , the curvature in production, ξ, the fixed costs parameter, f , the productivity
growth leverage, φ, the liquidation value parameter, s, the reorganizational costs parameter, κ, and
e as well as (iii) preferences: the risk aversion, γ, and the intertemporal elasticthe delisting return, R;

ity of substitution, ψ. In each experiment, we only vary one parameter, while keeping all the others
unchanged from the benchmark calibration. The only exception is that, when necessary, we adjust
17

the time discount factor, ι, to pin the average interest rate at around 1.8% per annum. Finally, for
each parameter, we consider two values, with one above and the other below the benchmark value.
Disaster Dynamics
From the first four columns in the upper panel of Table 7, increasing the disaster size and persistence
raises the value premium, and worsens the failure of the CAPM in samples without disasters. Intuitively, a higher magnitude for λD and θ strengthens the nonlinear, disaster dynamics, making the
linear CAPM an even poorer proxy for the pricing kernel, especially in normal times. The effect of
raising the disaster probability, η, goes in the same direction, but its quantitative impact is minimal.
Intuitively, η mainly determines the percentage of samples with at least one disaster episode out of
2,000 simulations. This percentage is 92% in the benchmark calibration with η = 0.23%, and 74%
with η = 0.13% and 97% with η = 0.33%. However, conditional on at least one disaster appearing
in a given sample, the nonlinear dynamics are mostly governed by the disaster size and persistence.
The recovery size and persistence have little impact on the magnitude of the value premium
and the performance of the CAPM. Intuitively, risk and risk premiums are mostly determined by
the model’s dynamics in bad times, particularly rare disasters, in which the representative agent’s
marginal utilities are the highest. In contrast, in the recovery state, in which marginal utilities are
at their lowest level, the risk and risk premium spreads between value and growth firms are tiny.
Technology
The last eight columns in the upper panel of Table 7 report the comparative statics with the four
adjustment costs parameters. The upward nonconvex costs parameter, a+ , and its downward counterpart, a− , work in the opposite direction. While increasing a+ reduces the value premium and its
CAPM alpha in normal times, increasing a− does the opposite. The a− effect works through the
familiar Zhang-Cooper asymmetry mechanism. A high value of a− means that value firms face a
higher hurdle in reducing their unproductive capital, giving rise to higher risk and risk premiums.

18

Why does the upward nonconvex costs parameter, a+ , work differently? Intuitively, firms disinvest very infrequently. In a typical simulation, only 0.5% of the firm-month observations have
negative investment. Such a low disinvestment frequency means that a+ is the main parameter that
determines the magnitude of nonconvex costs of adjustment, a+ Kit . A lower value of a+ means
that firms would in general have higher capital, including value firms. When a disaster hits, value
firms would be burdened with more unproductive capital, reinforcing the asymmetry mechanism.
As such, a lower a+ value increases the value premium and its CAPM alpha in no-disaster samples.
The upward convex costs parameter, c+ , works in the same direction as its downward counterpart, c− . A higher value of c− restricts the flexibility of value firms in reducing their unproductive
capital. Although applying to positive investment, c+ also limits value firms in adjusting their capital. However, the c+ effect works in the opposite direction as the a+ effect. The crux is that c+ involves quadratic adjustment costs, which do not reduce capital as directly as a+ in nonconvex costs.
From the first two columns in the lower panel of Table 7, decreasing the curvature in the production function by increasing ξ from 0.6 to 0.7 raises the value premium and the market beta of
the value-minus-growth decile, especially in disaster samples. Intuitively, the sensitivity of profits
to the aggregate productivity is ∂Πit /∂Xt = (1 − ξ)Zit1−ξ Kitξ Xt−ξ . In general, the relation between
this sensitivity and ξ is ambiguous. However, the relation tends to be positive for value firms with
high Kit and low Zit , but negative for growth firms with low Kit and high Zit . Also, the relation
is more likely to be positive when Xt is particularly low, as in disasters.
The next two columns in the lower panel show that reducing the fixed costs parameter, f ,
increases the value premium and its CAPM alpha in no-disaster samples. At first glance, this
result seems to contradict Zhang (2005), who reports that higher fixed costs imply a higher value
premium. The crux is that the fixed costs are proportional to capital in our economy with balanced growth, whereas the fixed costs are constant, independent of capital, in Zhang’s stationary
economy. While the constant fixed costs work as operating leverage in his model, the fixed costs

19

work in a similar way as the upward nonconvex costs of adjustment, a+ , in our model.
Increasing the productivity growth leverage, φ, raises the value premium and its CAPM alpha in
normal times. Intuitively, a higher φ implies a proportionally larger aggregate shock, including that
in the disaster state. More severe disasters in aggregate productivity increases the value premium,
and strengthens the disaster dynamics, giving rise to a higher CAPM alpha in no-disaster samples.
The next three technological parameters involve entry and exit, including the liquidation value
e Increasing s
parameter, s, the reorganizational costs parameter, κ, and the delisting return, R.

reduces the value premium and its CAPM alpha in no-disaster samples. Intuitively, in the event of
exit, existing shareholders extract a higher liquidation value of sKit , which is in effect a free abandonment option, acting as an insurance hedge against the disaster risk. The abandonment option is
especially attractive for shareholders of value firms, which tend to have more unproductive capital
than growth firms. Consequently, instead of facing asymmetric adjustment costs in disasters, the
shareholders opt to exit, thereby reducing the risk for value firms relative to growth firms. In
contrast to the strong s effect, the impact of the reorganizational costs parameter and the delisting
return is quantitatively negligible. With s = 0, meaning existing shareholders receive nothing when
exiting the economy, the percentage of exit firms is very low, only about 0.09% in simulations.
Preferences
The last four columns in the lower panel report the results for the risk aversion, γ, and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, ψ. Not surprisingly, increasing either parameter strengthens the
nonlinear disaster dynamics, raising the value premium and its CAPM alpha in no-disaster samples.

4.5

Further Implications on the Beta Anomaly

Our model is also largely consistent with the flat beta-return relation. Mimicking the empirical
procedure in Table 4, we sort stocks in simulated panels at the end of each June based on preranking market betas from prior 60-month rolling windows. We calculate value-weighted decile

20

returns, and rebalance the deciles in June. Panel A of Table 8 shows that in artificial samples with
disasters, the average excess return rises from 0.76% per month for the low rolling beta decile only
to 0.79% for the high decile, and the spread of 0.04% is within 0.5 standard errors from zero. The
pre-ranking market beta sorts also yield a spread in the post-ranking betas, although its magnitude,
0.30 (t = 2.49), is smaller than that in the data. The CAPM alpha of the high-minus-low decile is
−0.21%, albeit insignificant (t = −1.73). From Panel B, results from no-disaster samples are quantitatively similar. The high-minus-low beta decile has an average return of −0.06% (t = −0.93), a
CAPM alpha of −0.44% (t = −3.49), and a post-ranking market beta of 0.47 (t = 3.49).
It is perhaps surprising that our risk-based model can reproduce the flat beta-return relation in
simulations. The crux is that the rolling market beta contains a great deal of measurement errors,
and is, consequently, a poor proxy for the true market beta. Because of our single-factor structure,
all aggregate variables are conditionally perfectly correlated, including the pricing kernel and the
expected market risk premium, Et [RM t+1 ] − rf t . As such, the conditional CAPM holds exactly
in theory (but not the unconditional CAPM), meaning that the true market beta can be backed
out as (Et [Rit+1 ] − rf t )/(Et [RM t+1 ] − rf t ). The true market beta differs from the true beta with
respect to the pricing kernel, β M
it , which is calculated as (Et [Rit+1 ] − rf t )/λM t .
Panels C and D in Table 8 show that, not surprisingly, sorting on true market betas yields large
average return spreads, over 1.2% per month, across extreme deciles in the model. The (unconditional) CAPM fails to price these deciles both in disaster samples and no-disaster samples. In
disaster samples, the post-ranking rolling betas overshoot, giving rise to a negative CAPM alpha
of −0.73% (t = −1.98). In no-disaster samples, the rolling betas move in the opposite direction
as the true market betas, with a spread of −1.23 (t = −11.21). Accordingly, the CAPM alpha is
2.23% (t = 21.52), which is substantially higher than the average return spread of 1.22%.
To illustrate measurement errors in rolling market betas, Figure 6 presents the scatter plots of
true market betas against their corresponding rolling betas, using deciles formed on rolling market

21

betas as the testing portfolios. From Panel A, these deciles show substantial variations in rolling
betas, ranging from −40 to 40, in disaster samples. However, such substantial variations only
transform to small variations in true market betas from 0.5 to 2.5. In no-disaster samples, Panel
B shows that rolling betas range from −20 to 20, and true market betas from 0.5 to 1.8. The correlation between the true and rolling market betas is weakly negative, −0.03, in disaster samples,
but strongly negative, −0.35, in no-disaster samples.
Panels C and D present the scatter plots using deciles formed on true market betas as the
testing portfolios. The variations in true market betas range from zero to 12 in disaster samples,
and from zero to four in no-disaster samples. Rolling market betas remain a poor proxy for true
market betas. Their correlations is weakly positive, 0.08, in disaster samples, but reliably negative,
−0.20, in no-disaster samples. It is surprising how poor the rolling betas are as a proxy for true
market betas, especially in no-disaster samples. Intuitively, based on 60-month rolling windows, the
rolling betas are basically prior five-year averaged betas. In contrast, true market betas accurately
and immediately reflect changes in aggregate and firm-specific conditions. Within a given rolling
window, true market betas can even mean-revert, giving rise to opposite rankings in rolling betas.

Conclusion

Rare disasters help explain the value premium puzzle that value stocks earn higher average returns
than growth stocks, despite their similar market betas. In an investment model augmented with
disasters, we show that value stocks are more exposed to disaster risk than growth stocks. More
important, the disaster risk induces strong nonlinearity in the pricing kernel. In finite samples,
in which disasters are materialized, the CAPM does an adequate job in accounting for the value
premium. More important, in finite samples without disasters, estimated market betas fail to measure the higher exposures of value stocks to the disaster risk than growth stocks. This nonlinearity
allows the model to replicate the failure of the CAPM in the post-1963 sample. In addition, due
to severe measurement errors in rolling betas, the relation between pre-ranking betas and average
22

returns is flat in the model’s simulations, despite a strong positive relation between true betas and
expected returns. As such, the model is also consistent with the beta anomaly.

We discretize the state space using 100 grid points for Kit , 13 points for zit , and seven grid
points for gt . We specify the lower bound of the capital grid to be 0.01 and the upper bound to be
25. The interval is so large enough that the two bounds are never binding in simulations. We construct the capital grid recursively, following McGrattan (1999), i.e., Kj = Kj1 + ck1 exp(ck2 (j − 2)),
in which j = 1, ..., 100 is the index of grid points, and ck1 and ck2 are two constant parameters
chosen to provide the desired number of grid points and the upper bound of the capital grid, given a
predetermined lower bound of 0.01. We use the piecewise linear interpolation to obtain firm value,
investment, and expected returns that do not lie directly on the grid points. Finally, we use a simple
global search routine in maximizing the right-hand side of equation (B.3). The objective function
is computed on a grid of Kit+1 between 0.01 and 25 with 12,000 points, and a simple maximum
is taken. We solve for the value function sequentially. After the value function is obtained on the
coarse Kit+1 grid, we use it as the initial condition in the next stage of maximization with a finer
grid of Kit+1 . The final results are from a Kit+1 grid with 120,000 points.

Table 6 : The CAPM Regressions for the Book-to-market Deciles in the Model
Results are averaged across 2,000 simulated economies. The mean excess returns, denoted m, and the CAPM
alphas are in monthly percent. We also report the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for the alphas and betas. The
t-statistics are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations.

Table 7 : Comparative Statics
Results are averaged across 2,000 simulations. In each experiment, we vary one parameter, while keeping all the others unchanged from the
benchmark calibration. For each parameter, for example, the disaster size, λD , we consider two values, with one above, −0.03, and the other below,
−0.025, the benchmark value, −0.0275. See Table 5 for the descriptions of the symbols.

Figure 2 : The Impulse Response of Log Consumption to a Disaster Shock in the Model
In simulated data, when the economy enters the disaster state, we calculate the cumulative drop in log
consumption for 25 years after the impulse. Consumption is time-aggregated from the monthly to annual
frequency. The impulse response is averaged across more than 20,000 disaster episodes.

in the Model’s Simulations
Results are based on 300 simulations of a disaster shock in year one, and we trace the responses for 25 years
afterward. The solid blue lines are for the value decile, the broken red lines the growth deciles, and the black
dotted lines are the average responses across ten book-to-market deciles.
