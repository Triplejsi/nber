A Standard Monetary Model and the Variability of
the Deutschemark-Dollar Exchange Rate

ABSTRACT

This paper uses a novel test to see whether the Heese (1985)
and Woo (1985) models are consistent with the variability of the
deutschemark - dollar exchange rate 1974-1984. The answer, perhaps

surprisingly, is yes. Both models, however, explain the month to
month variability as resulting in a critical way from unobservable
shocks to money demand and purchasing power parity. It would
therefore be of interest in future work to model one or both of
these shocks as
functions of economic variables.

1. Introduction
The implications of rationality and market efficiency for the
variability of floating exchange rates have long been debated.

Some

thirty years ago, Friedman (1953) argued that speculation in a free
market would stabilize exchange rates.

Others [Viner (1956), cited in

Sohmen (1969)1, argued at least implicitly that this might not be the

case. The observed fluctuations of exchange rates in recent years do not
appear to have created a consensus view. Some believe these fluctuations
consistent with rational responses to news about basic economic variables
[Frenkel (1981), Frenkel and Mussa (1980)], others are doubtful [Huang
(1981), Meese (1985)].

Formal evidence on whether exchange rates are in some well defined

sense excessively variable is of interest for two reasons. The first,
and perhaps more obvious, is that insofar as excess variability is prima

fade evidence of market inefficiency, the implications for economic

policy may be profound. See, for example, Tobin (1978). The second
reason, emphasized by Shiller (1981) in connection with stock market
studies, is that variability tests can produce very useful diagnostics.
A rejection of a model by a variability test may provide guidance for

future research: if a model cannot explain the variability of exchange
rates, then clearly in future research we should look for factors that
will make exchange rates variable.
This paper extends the variability test I developed and applied to

stock market data in West (1986). I evaluate whether the variability of
the dollar/deutschemark exchange rate is consistent with the monetary

models developed in Meese (1985) and Woo (1985). The answer, perhaps
suprisingly, is yes. The 1974-1984 variability in this exchange rate is

-2-

Consistent with these models. The shocks to money demand and purchasing
power parity assumed present by Meese and Woo play a key role in this

result. If

the

shocks are instead assumed absent, as in, for example,

Huang (1981), the models are no longer consistent with the 1974-84
variability.

The models therefore explain the month to month fluctuations in the
deutschemark -

dollar

exchange rate as responses to not only news about

basic economic variables, but also to shocks to money demand and

purchasing power parity. Such an explanation certainly is logically
coherent. But it is in my opinion not completely satisfactory, at least
insofar as exchange rates are plausibly thought to move mainly in

response to news about basic economic variables. It therefore would be
of interest in future work using a monetary model to model one or both of
these shocks explicitly, as functions at least in part of observable

economic variables. This applies especially to shocks to purchasing
power parity, which are in either model the entire explanation of

deviations from purchasing power parity. Further work on sticky price
models such as Driskel]. (1981) and Frankel (1979) are therefore of
interest.

The extent to which the apparent consistency of the models with the
variability of exchange rates may be considered evidence against
irrationalities, inefficiences and speculative bubbles is limited at best

to the extent one believes the models correctly explain the exchange

rate. Given the well documented difficulty in developing structural
exchange rate models [Meese and Rogoff (1983a, 1983b)], most economists,
including me, would probably be hesitant to endorse without reservation

any structural model, even one as carefully developed as Meese's or

-3—

Woo's. Consequently, I do not believe a strong case can be made that the
results here argue against speculative bubbles or against the notion that
exchange rate models should take into account potential shifts in policy

that do not occur [see Flood and odrick (1986) and Obstfeld and Rogoff
(1985) on this important point]. Instead the results have the natural
interpretation of providing a constructive suggestion about future

exchange rate modelling, as described in the previous paragraph. In this
connection, it is worth emphasizing that while the estimation technique,
sample period and data used here are different than in Meese and Woo, the

models are precisely as in those papers. The models are presented only
briefly and somewhat uncritically. In particular, no attempt is made to
argue for either Woo or Meese when the two make contradictory assumptions

(for example, whether secular drift is deterministic or stochastic). My
aim is to establish a robust result. More extensive discussion of the
models, as well as references to similar models, may be found in the
original tleese and Woo papers.

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the models
and develops the variability test. Section 3 presents empirical results.
Section 4 has conclusions. An Appendix has some technical details.

2. The Exchange Rate Models
Two models are used, those of Woo (1985) and Meese (1985). Both models

combine a money demand equation, an interest parity condition, and a
purchasing power parity condition. The unobservable shocks that Woo and

Mjese add to certain of the equations are

temporarily

suppressed for

xpositional ease; these shocks will be restored later in this section.
In Woo, U.S. and German money demand are given by

where m is the log of the money stock, p the log of the price level, y log

income, i a nominal interest rate. The ar's are

positive

parameters, with

less than one. A "u" superscript denotes U.S., a "f" Germany. Woo
(1985,pp2—3) states that direct tests of this money demand specification

suggest that it is satisfactory, at least for 19714—81. To make it less
likely that the basic results of this paper are explained by a shift in
money demand during the larger sample period used here (19714-814), the

empirical work applies the variability test to a subsample that falls
within the 19714—81 period.

The left hand side of (8) is thus simply the variance of the innovation in

Equation (11) may be estimated by instrumental variables.

Potential

instruments include current and lagged values of all the right hand side
variables except

which is not a legitimate instrument since it is

correlated with the disturbance. One can retrieve parameters of interest
by simple arithmetic on the regression coefficients.

For example, a1 -

one can obtain an estimate of the left hand side of (8) using b2a2.
Inference about the estimates of equation (11) will be difficult if, as

Two possibilities, not

One

can assume more

generally that the u in (114) also reflects the sluggish deviations from

PPP that are observed empirically. Meese assumes that the u in (114)'
results from a random walk disturbance to the PPP equation (5). One can
again assume something more general, namely, that in (114)' u also reflects

a random walk disturbance to the money demand equation (3)'. A white noise
shock to (114) and (114)', then, is consistent with the sort of money demand

of variables as instruments, (1k) and (1k)' can be estimated. Not.e that

the estimates are consistent in general under plausible identifying
assumptions (e.g.. that there are predetermined variables that shift the
money supply but that do not appear in money demand). This is true whether
or not the exchange rate and the money supply are endogenous, in either the
sense of Granger causality or the usual simultaneous equations sense.

will turn out to be much more complicated than when the usual regression

inequalities (8) and (8)' can still be used

The basic idea for the Woo specification is a follows; details

are in the Appendix. Under the null hypothesis of no bubbles, the two
nonzero moments of the MA(1) disturbance nti——Eni and Erlt+iflt—-depend on

Even with a u shock present, the right hand side of (8) or (8)' can be

presence of a white noise disturbance u, then, one can compare the lower
bound estimates of

to the calculated value of the right-hand side

of (8) or (8)'. In the absence of bubbles, this lower bound should satisfy
(8) or (8)'.

Before turning

to

the empirical results, it is important

aspects of the procedure

that might

to

not be immediately obvious. The first

relates to the procedure's implicit assumption that

the

estimates of the

ARIMA process for the fundamentals yields an accurate estimate of the right

hand sides of (8) and (8)'. One circumstance in which this will probably

—1 3-

not be the case is when this process has shifted during the sample used in
estimation or has been expected by the market to shift during or after the

sample. This will happen if there are changes in policy rules [Flood and
Hodrlck (1986), Obstfeld and Rogoff (1985)]. This very real possibility Is

difficult (at least for me) to Incorporate into the null.

A partial

solution is to obtain separate estimates for different sample periods if
there is theoretical or empirical evidnce of a midsarnple process shift.
This will not, however, help if agents expected a shift that did not or has

yet to occur. Consequently, a rejection of the null can be interpreted
equally well as evidence of bubbles or as evidence of expected or actual
shifts of the fundamentals process.

The second feature to note is that as long as the ARIMA process is
stable, the procedure is legitimate whether or not there is feedback from

the exchange rate or other variables to the fundamentals variables.
Inequalities (8) and (8)' hold so long as money and real Income follow and

are expected to follow a stable process.

Any other variables that help

determine money and real income in equilibrium have been implicitly solved

Empirical Results

3.1 Data
The raw data were monthly and seasonally unadjusted, 1974:1 to
1984:5. Data from 1973 and 1984:6 were used for lags and leads. Data on
industrial production, money stock (Ml) and the spot exchange rate
(dollar/deutschemark) were kindly supplied by Richard Meese; a detailed
description of this data set may be found in Meese and Rogoff (1983b).
The raw data appeared to require some transformations to induce

stationarity. It is well known that detrending and differencing a
variable are not asymptotically equivalent, whether the variable's
secular drift is deterministic or stochastic [Nelson and Plosser (1982)].

Rather than get sidetracked into analysis of the source of the pronounced

upward movement of some of the variables (especially y and

I

decided to handle such apparent nonstationarity as did Woo and Meese.

The actual data used in my test of the Woo specification therefore were
the residuals from a regression of levels of variables on seasonal

dummies and a linear time trend, because Woo assumed that secular drift

is deterministic. The data used in the Meese specification were the
residuals from a regression of differences of variables on seasonal
dummies, because Meese assumed that secular drift is stochastic.3
Separate detrending regressions were run for each of the subsamples

described below. Since all estimation was linear, the estimates of
regression coefficients are identical to those that would have been
obtained had the trend and seasonal terms been included in the

regressions. These preliminary regressions were done to cut down the
otherwise enormous size of the variance covariance matrix of the
parameters.

—15—

Estimates were obtained for 1974:1 to 1984:5, and for two subsamples

as well, 1974:1 to 1979:9 and 1979:10 to 1984:5. The subsample estimates
were obtained because, as noted in the previous section, the procedure
described in the previous section for estimating the requisite innovation
variances tacitly assumes that the fundamentals variables follow a stable
ARIMA process over the entire sample period, and there is some evidence

that they did not. The tests in Meese (1985), for example, suggest that
the Fed's October 1979 change in operating procedures resulted in a shift
to the ARIMA process of

Woo (1985), on the other hand,

and/or

found that the Fed's change did not result in such a shift. While
neither paper uses precisely my sample period nor my specification for
the fundamentals process, and Woo uses different (seasonally adjusted)

data, the data are similar enough that the hypothesis of stability seems

debatable. I therefore also estimated and tested the model using not
only the entire sample period, but also the pre- and post- October 1979

subsamples. Note that the use of these subsamples implicitly assumes
that the market instantaneously caught on to any such shift by the Fed,

and, as noted in the previous section, that the market did not expect
such a shift.

3.2. Estimation technique
For the Woo specification, four regression equations were estimated:
equation (14), and a three variable vector autoregression for the

*

fundamentals variables m, yU and y. The lag length for the
autoregression was set at four when the whole sample was used, two when a

subsample was used. For the whole sample regressions, then, there were
twelve variables (12=3 variables x 4 lags per variable) on the right hand
side of each of the three autoregressions. The corresponding figure for

—16—

the

subsample regressions was six.

A shorter lag length was used in the

subsamples to preserve degrees of freedom. Diagnostic tests such as Q
statistics suggested that the lag lengths were adequate, for the whole

sample and both subsamples. Some experimentation, summarized in footnote
9, indicated that the results are not sensitive to choice of lag length.
For the Meese specification, three regression equations were

estimated: equation (14)', and a two variable vector autoregression for

the fundamentals variables Am and

Lag lengths were chosen as in

the Woo specification.

Let 8 denote the vector of parameters that must be estimated to

calculate the innovation variances of interest. The vector 0 consists of
the coefficients on the right hand side variables in (14) or (14)'; Er11
and Efl+1r, the first and second autocovariances of the disturbance to
(14) or (14)'; the coefficients on the right hand side variables in the

fundamentals autoregressions; and the elements of the variance
covariance matrix of the innovations in the fundamentals. In the Woo
specification, for example, 0 contains forty eight elements, when
estimating with the entire sample period: four coefficients on the right
hand side of (14); Er1÷1 and Eflt÷iq; thirty six coefficients on the
right hand side of the autoregressions; and the six independent elements
of the variance covariance matrix of the disturbances to the
fundamentals' autoregressions.

The elements of 0 were estimated as follows. The right hand side
variables in (14) and (14)' were estimated by two stage least squares,
with the right hand side variables of the autoregressions used as

instruments. The moments Er)+1 and

were estimated from the

moments of the two stage least squares residuals. The autoregression

—17—

parameters were estimated by OLS. The elements of the variance
covariance matrix of the autoregression disturbances were estimated from
the OLS residuals, with the usual degrees of freedom adjustment.

Calculation of the asymptotic covariance matrix of 0 is described in

the Appendix. It suffices to make three remarks here. First, the
standard errors on the coefficients in (14) and (14)' allow for the MA(1)
serial correlation that r) displays if there is a u shock present. They

are, however, still consistent if fl is serially uncorrelated when u is
absent. Second, standard errors on all regression coefficients were
calculated to allow for arbitrary heteroskedasticity conditional on the
instruments (i.e., conditional on the right-hand-side variables in the

autoregressions). Third, proper account was taken not only of the
uncertainty in the estimates of the regression coefficients, but also of
(a)the uncertainty in the estimates of the variances and covariances such
as

and (b) the correlation of the estimates of the various elements

of 0.

The innovation variances in equations (8) and (8)' are complicated

functions of 0. Let f(O) denote one of these variances. The standard

error on f(0) was calculated as [(af/a0)V(af/a0)]½, where V is the
variance-covarjance matrix of e.

The derivatives 8f/0 of all such

functions were calculated numerically.

3.3. Empirical results
Table 1 reports the estimates of the basic regression parameters.4
Consider first the estimates of (14), in lines (1) to (3). About half the
estimates are significantly different from zero at the five per cent

level, and almost all are more or less reasonable. Consider first the
interest semielasticity 80. Its estimates vary somewhat from sample to

—18—

sample, but are roughly consistent with the estimates in Woo and Meese.

f
The estimates of both the U.S. and German income elasticities a1 and a1
are also roughly consistent with the slightly higher estimates in Woo.

The estimates of a2 are, again, similar to those in Woo. One estimate
[line (2)] exceded its theoretical upper bound of unity, as did one of

Woo's estimates [Woo (1985, p8)]. Combining a and a2, or a and a2, for
lines (1) and (3) yields, as in Woo, a somewhat high long run income
elasticity of two or more.

Now consider the estimates of (14)' in lines (4) to (6) of Table 1.
The estimates of a0 were obtained by imposing a1=.5 as did Meese.

Results and estimates for a1=.4 and a1=.3, the other two imposed values

of a1 for which Meese reported results, were almost identical.5 The
estimates of a0 are somewhat lower than in Meese, but, perhaps, not
implausibly so. One of the three estimates is significantly different
from zero at the five per cent level [line (5)].
In sum, then, the regression results suggest that the Woo

specification is quite acceptable, the Meese specification less so. In
addition, it is reassuring that the use of different sample periods,

estimation techniques and, in the case of Woo, different data, leads to
qualitatively similar parameter estimates. Let us now turn to the

variability test. Column (1) of Table 2 presents the estimates of the
right hand sides of (8) and (8)1.6 Column (2) reports the estimate of

the variance of a2 if the unobservable shock u is assumed absent. Under
the null hypothesis that bubbles are also absent, the column 2 estimate

should be less than the column (1) estimate. It is not, for any of the
six specifications. Column (2) is anywhere from five to two hundred

times as large as column (1). It is significantly larger (at the five

—19—

percent level) in two specifications [lines (1) and (5)]•7 See column
(3). Ny variability test, inequalities (8) and (8)', therefore indicates
as did Huang's (1981) that a standard monetary model with neither bubbles
nor the usual regression disturbance is inconsistent with the variability
of the $/DM exchange rate.8
The monetary models are not, however, inconsistent with the data if

one allows for the usual regression disturbance. Column (4) reports the
minimum possible value of a, calculated as described in the Appendix.
Column (5) reports the difference between columns (1) and (4). With one
exception [line (2)], the column (4) estimate is less than the column (1)

value. The difference, unfortunately, is estimated rather imprecisely.
In only one specification [line (4)1 is the point estimate of the
difference significantly different from zero at the five percent level.
It is clear nonetheless that once regression disturbances are permitted,

one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the variance of the innovation
in the expected present discounted value of fundamentals is less when the
market's information set is used (ci)

than

when only past values of

fundamentals are used [column (1)]. This result is robust to changes in
the lag length of the fundamentals autoregression.9
The consistency does not, in my opinion, mean that the Woo and Meese

models capture the variability in an entirely satisfactory fashion. It
is often argued that the exchange rate is an asset price and ought to
fluctuate as do many asset prices in response to news about economic

variables [Frenkel (1981), Nussa and Frenkel (1980)]. The empirical
results suggest that in the Woo and Meese models these fluctuations
result in an important way from shocks that have no explicit links to
economic theory or even to any economic variables (except, of course,

—20—

tautologically, to the variables in the equations in which the shocks

appear). Therefore, while it undoubtedly is desirable to allow for
regression disturbances in exchange rate models, it appears that some
nontrivial extensions to the Woo and Meese models are required, if one of
these models is to explain the fluctuations basically as responses to

news about observable economic variables. This may well be true of other
monetary models as well. In any case, it would seem highly desirable to
model deviations from PPP as functions at least in part of observable

economic variables. Sticky price models such as Driskell (1981) and
Frankel (1979) may be useful starting points.

3.4. Comparison with previous studies
The basic conclusion of this paper conflicts with previous studies

on volatility and speculative bubbles [Huang (1981), Meese (1985)]. A
reconciliation with these studies therefore is in order.

Reconciliation with Huang (1981) is simple. Huang followed some
studies such as Bilson (1978) and assumed no regression disturbances in

any of the basic equations. As was just noted, when this assumption is
made here, the result is that the monetary model cannot explain the

variability of the exchange rate. Surely, this argues more for allowing
for the usual regression disturbance than for a basic failure of the
monetary model. See Hodrick (1979) on the theoretical importance of
allowing for the usual regression disturbances.
Reconciliation with Meese (1985) is not quite as straightforward.

Meese applied to the exchange rate the test speculative bubbles that I

developed and applied to stock prices in West (1985). A general
description of my specification test may be found in West (1985). For

—21—

concreteness I will explain it here in the context of Meese's
application.

The specification test compares two estimates of b, b —=

—1

(1+a0)

a0

as in (7)'. One estimate of b is obtained from equation (14)' by
instrumental variables, and is consistent even if there are bubbles. The
second estimate is obtained from estimation of two types of equations: a
closed form solution to the expected present discounted formula (7)', and

the fundamentals process. This second estimate is not consistent if

there are bubbles. Meese compared the two estimates of b and found them
more different than is consistent with sampling error. The implication
is that there are bubbles.

There are at least two possible explanations for the conflict

between Meese's results and those of the present paper. Both,

unsurprisingly, are econometric. The first is that the specification
test may have more power. The second is that one test may have better
finite sample properties. I suspect that the present paper's test is
better in this respect, at least when there are in—sample shifts in the

ARIMA process of the fundamentals variables. This is because such shifts
will obscure the link between the ARIMA process and the closed form
solution to (7)'. This will potentially cause a strong bias in the
second of the two estimates of b that were described in the previous

paragraph. By contrast, although the present variability test requires a
fundamentals process that is stable and expected by the market to remain
so, there appears to be no presumption that it is biased toward finding

excess variability if the process in fact is unstable: both sides of
(8)' are likely to be estimated quite noisily.

—22—

Both of these possible explanations are quite tentative. Some
further research is required to reconcile the fact that one of my bubble
tests finds bubbles, the other does not.

4. Conclusions
Two basically standard monetary models appear to be consistent with

the 1974-84 variability of the $/DM exchange rate. As noted in the
introduction, the extent to which this consistency may be interpreted as

evidence against speculative bubbles or process switching is limited at
best to the extent one believes the models correctly explain this

exchange rate. But regardless of how enthusiastically one endorses
either model, it is of note that shocks to money demand and PPP play a

key role in the apparent consistency of the models with the data. It is
therefore of interest in future work to model these shocks as functions
at least in part of observable economic variables.

-23-

Footnotes

1.

It is appropriate to add a word on the theoretical question of

whether bubbles are consistent with rationality, in light of the claims
by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1985) and Diba and Grossman (1985) that they are

not. The most rigorous and general paper that I am aware of that deals
with this question is Tirole (1985). Tirole establishes that bubbles are
perfectly consistent with rationality in a standard overlapping

generations model, under suitable conditions. That Diba and Grossman
(1985) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1985) find bubbles inconsistent with

their models appears to reflect more the particular characteristics of
the models they use rather than any general presumption against bubbles.

2. The disturbance u iS a linear combination of a shock to the money
demand equation (3), say, u1, and a shock to the purchasing power parity

equation (5), say, u2. In principle u could depend on a shock to the
interest parity conditon (4) as well. But as far as I know, such a shock
has not been assumed present in previous empirical work. Simple

arithmetic yields u =

Ch10)(_uit+u2t_a2u2t_i)

(-ui+u2) in (14)'. For

in (14), u =

(1+a0)

to be white noise in (14) requires that

u1 be white noise and/or u2 be AR(1) with parameter a2. For u to be
white noise in (14)' requires that u1 and/or u2 be a random walk.
These requirements appear to be roughly consistent with existing
empirical evidence. See, e.g., Goldfeld (1976) or Mankiw and Suimners

(1984) on the disturbances to the money demand equation. See Adler and
Lehman (1983), Hakkio (1984) and Roll (1979) for evidence that deviations
from PPP have a serial correlation coefficient quite near one. Since a2

-24-

also appears to be quite near one [Goldfeld (1976), Woo (1985) and the

estimates presented here], the assumption that u2_a2u2 is white noise
is probably reasonable.

Technically, Woo and Meese cannot both be correct. As stated in the
introduction, however, the aim of this paper is to establish a robust

result concerning the monetary model. I will therefore not attempt to
reconcile the technically contradictory assumptions of Woo and Meese
concerning these shocks.

3. Note that it follows from equations (15) and (15)' that under the
null hypothesis of no bubbles, the endogenous drift in the exchange rate
(if any) will be deterministic under Woo's assumptions about shocks and

fundamentals variables. Similarly, the exchange rate has a unit

root

under Meese's assumptions.

4. The estimates of the fundamentals processes are not reported, to
conserve space. An appendix containing these estimates, as well as those
of the initial regressions to induce stationarity, is available on
request.

5. Allowing a1 to be estimated freely did not generate similar results.
In this case, in two of the three samples, either a0 or a1 or both were

wildly implausible (a0 > 100, or a1 negative). I therefore did not even

calculate the variability test. It is not clear to me why unconstrained
estimates were not sensible. A referee has commented that this suggests
a specification error in Meese's model, and, citing Cumby and Obstfeld
(1984), has suggested that one possible culprit is Meese's assumption
that deviations from PPP are a random walk.

6. It may help in interpreting all the figures in Table 2 to note that
the 1973-3 to 1984-5 variance in

is 11.53 (times Ø4)• The

-25-

in-sample variance of the news about fundamentals in line (1), column
(1), thus, is about one sixth of what would be the out-of-sample error
variance from forecasting the spot rate as a random walk.

7. For the Meese specification in lines (4) to (6), the column (2)

estimate may be calculated as either .5b2Efl1 or _b2Efl+ifl. The
former is reported in Table 2. The latter yields values lower than those
in column (2), but still much larger than those in column (1).

8. The figures reported in Table 2 are based on estimates that used lags
of fundamentals variables as instruments. For lines (1) to (3),
different (and more efficient) estimates of columns (1) to (3) may be

obtained when there is no disturbance u by using current as well as
lagged values of fundamentals as instruments. See the discussion in
section 2. So I recalculated columns (1) and (2) using estimates
obtained when current as well as lagged values were used. For all three
sample periods, column (2) was greater than column (1).

9. To see whether the results were sensitive to choice of lag length of
the fundamentals autoregression, I calculated two additional point
estimates (but not standard errors) of each of the Table 2 entries.

These were for lag lengths r2 and 3, for the whole sample, r=3 and 4 for
the subsamples. The Woo specification proved quite robust, with all
additional calculations yielding a negative figure for column (3) in
Table 2, and a positive figure for column (5). The ileese specification
was not as robust. Three samples produced implausible parameter estimates,

such as negative b (whole sample, r2, and first subsample. r3 and
r4). The other three samples did, however, yield a positive figure
for column (3), and all but r—4, second subsample, produced a negative
figure for column (5).
