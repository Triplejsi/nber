ABSTRACT
The impact of school resources on the quality of education in developing countries may depend crucially
on whether resources are targeted efficiently. In this paper we use a randomized experiment to analyze
the impact of a school grants program in Senegal, which decentralized a portion of the country’s education
budget. We find large positive effects on test scores at younger grades that persist at least two years.
We show that these effects are concentrated among schools that focused funds on human resources
improvements rather than school materials, suggesting that teachers and principals may be a central
determinant of school quality.

Introduction

In the last 50 years, primary school enrollment has increased dramatically in the developing world.
Even in the poorest areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, gross enrollment rates in primary school are
approaching 80 percent (e.g., Glewwe and Kremer (2006)). There is, however, widespread evidence
that the quality of education in developing countries remains very low. As a result, increases in
school enrollment may not translate into corresponding increases in productivity and wellbeing.
This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that education quality, not quantity, matters
most for growth (e.g., Hanushek and Woessmann (2010), Glewwe et al. (2013)).
We address the following question: is it possible to improve the quality of poor schools by
providing them with cash transfers? The appeal of this idea lies in its simplicity. The assumption
behind it is that local decision makers, such as principals and community leaders, are likely to have
a deeper understanding of the needs of their schools than central education authorities, and are
therefore in the best position to put these resources to their most efficient use.
We study a school grant program in Senegal, which was developed to decentralize at least a
small part of the country’s education budget. Through this program, every elementary school in
Senegal could apply for funds for a specific school project that seeks to improve the quality of
learning and teaching, with the best proposals being selected through a competitive process. The
maximum amount a school could receive for a project amounted to USD$3,190, which corresponded
to 7 percent of the total annual school budget of a typical school (inclusive of teacher salaries).
We find large and statistically significant effects on test scores one year after the start of the
intervention, for children who benefited from school grants when they were in second grade especially for girls. The effects are larger for schools in the South of the country, where projects
tended to focus on training human resources (teaching and management), compared to the North,
where priority was placed on the acquisition of school material (e.g., textbooks/manuals). We do
not observe similar program impacts for children in other grades. The point estimates are very
similar in the second follow up for the same children, pointing to persistent effects.
Since we examine the impact of the intervention across different tests and different groups
of students, for inferential purposes we implement a step-down procedure proposed by Romano
and Wolf (2005) that controls the probability of falsely rejecting at least one true null hypothesis,

2

and improves upon more conservative prior methods for multiple hypothesis testing such as the
Bonferroni procedure. We show that our main conclusions survive and are unlikely to be due to
false rejections.
The evidence on the effect of school resources on primary school student achievement in developing countries is at best mixed (see Glewwe and Kremer (2006), Glewwe et al. (2013), and
Murnane and Ganimian (2014) for reviews). While some pedagogical resources, such as textbooks
and flipcharts, only have positive effects for high-achieving students (see Glewwe et al. (2009),
Glewwe et al. (2004)), other resources such as computer-assisted instruction increased test scores
by up to one-half of a standard deviation in India (Banerjee et al. (2007)). If local decision-makers
can target resources better than a central authority, however, school grants (and other ways of
decentralizing funding) could help boost the effect of school resources by targeting funds toward
efficient uses of resources (see Galiani and Perez-Truglia (2013) for a review).
In theory, decentralizing decision making about school resources is a good idea, but in practice,
this idea is often dismissed. The main problem is that principals in public schools (or other local
decision makers) may not be incentivized to use resources optimally to serve students. Recent
work on secondary schools in Argentina and primary schools in the Gambia find positive effects of
decentralization (Galiani et al. (2008), Blimpo et al. (2014)). Meanwhile, cross-country comparisons
show negative effects of decentralization for developing countries (Hanushek et al. (2013)). Our
results indicate that decentralized distribution of resources through school grants can have positive
effects on student achievement, and we present suggestive evidence that factors such as teacher
quality may have enhanced the impacts.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe the school grants program in Senegal
and the evaluation design. In Section 3 we describe our data and Section 4 describes our empirical
approach. In Section 5 we present our main results and examine potential mediating factors through
which the impact of the program may have operated. Section 6 concludes.

Description of the Program and Evaluation

Primary schooling in Senegal consists of six years of education and is funded through a mix of
government, foreign aid, and household resources.1 Almost all classroom instruction is conducted
in French, while the language spoken by students at home is predominantly not French (only 11
percent of the household interviews were conducted in French). Gross enrollment rates in primary
schools increased dramatically over the ten years prior to our study, from 67 percent in 2000 to
92 percent in 2009. Despite this large increase in enrollment, in 2009 only 60 percent of students
completed primary school. In an effort to increase the quality of primary education, Senegal’s
Ministry of Education initiated this school grants program (see Appendix A for more historical
details).

2.1

School Grants in Senegal

For the past several years, Senegal has used school grants (projets d’école) as a tool to fund
improvements in education quality, based on the premise that school-level actors are in the best
position to identify a school’s unique deficiencies and the most workable solutions to address them.
Beginning in 2009, the emphasis of these grants shifted from strengthening the physical environment
toward pedagogic issues. At that point the government also sought technical and financial support
from the World Bank to rigorously evaluate the program.
The main goal of the program was to improve school quality, as measured by student learning outcomes, specifically by improving pedagogical resources in the school. Instead of providing
general funding for all schools, funds were targeted towards problems identified by the school
as major obstacles to quality, and identified by a government evaluation committee (Inspection
Départementale de l’Education Nationale, IDEN) as being eligible for funding based on districtlevel and system-wide priorities. Problems were identified at the local level, in the hope that
decentralized decision-making would allow more efficient and effective use of funds.
Generally, the program worked as follows. The Ministry of Education issued a call for proposals,
based on the available grant funding, priority areas, and eligible activities (and sometimes eligible
regions). Schools that decided to apply for funding completed a grant application for a school
1

Fees collected from parents represent around ten percent of school funding in 2006 (PASEC (2007)) and are a
non-trivial financial burden on families: around one-fifth of students who dropped out in the first year of primary
school did so because of limited financial resources of their parents (World Bank (2013)).

project (called the projet d’école) addressing a particular pedagogical issue faced by the school.
Another important component of the program was its role in promoting strong community participation in schools. As a result, grants were prepared by a committee of parents, teachers, and local
officials. For schools that received a grant, the grant totaled around 1,500,000 CFA Francs (approximately USD$3,190), which represented a roughly 7 percent increase in expenditures per student
in a typical school (inclusive of teacher salaries, which comprise over 90 percent of the budget).2
In Section 2.2 we describe the process through which grants were approved and allocated.

2.2

Evaluation Design

In the initial stage of this study, all Senegalese schools were eligible to respond to the call for proposals. The IDEN evaluation committee first ranked the applications and discarded low quality and
ineligible applications. The remaining ones, referred to as “approved applications” were grouped
into two categories. The first consisted of very good proposals which were eligible for financing. The
second consisted of strong proposals with potential, but which needed revision. These were sent
back to schools with comments from the IDEN evaluation committee, then re-submitted. Figure 1
provides a graphical representation of this process.
This process resulted in the selection of 633 projects to fund, whose locations are shown in
Figure 2.3 For the purposes of the evaluation, these 633 projects were randomly allocated to three
funding cohorts. 211 schools were selected randomly to receive funding in the first cohort (June
2009), at the end of the school year. This funding could only be executed at the beginning of the
following school year (October/November). Of the remaining schools, 211 were to receive funding
in June 2010, and another 211 were to receive funding in June 2011. In practice, the disbursement
of the second round of grants did not occur until the first trimester of 2011. This means that
between mid-2009 and mid-2011, two groups of schools can be compared. The schools in the first
cohort received school grants during this period, while the schools in the second and third cohorts
did not and therefore can be used as a comparison group for the schools in the first cohort. The
school year runs from October/November through June, allowing us to compare the first cohort to
2

These numbers are based on collected self-reports from principals and teachers in our sample.
Of these projects, 96 percent included a component to improve French outcomes, 70 percent had a component to
improve math outcomes, and 52 percent had a component to improve science outcomes. 82 percent of the projects
aimed to build capacity, 63 percent aimed to increase teaching time, and 45 percent aimed to reduce repetition and
drop-out. The intended beneficiaries of these projects, in addition to students, were the teachers and principal in 84
percent of projects, and the management committee in 29 percent of projects.

both the second and third cohorts for the 2009-2010 school year and the first cohort to the third
cohort for the 2010-2011 school year (see Figure 3).
The randomization among eligible schools is critical for our study: it ensures that the three
successive cohorts are statistically comparable, which in turn ensures unbiased estimates of the
effect of the program. In this process it is crucial that the control group contains only schools that
were judged as eligible but were not selected to receive funding by the randomization process until
a later date.

Data and Balance

In order to gather data for this study, three waves of surveys were administered to students and
their families, teachers, and principals in these schools. A baseline survey was conducted at the
start of the 2009-2010 academic year (in November), right as the first round of grants were able to
be executed. Subsequent surveys took place in November 2010 at the beginning of the 2010-2011
academic year (first follow-up), and in May 2011 at the end of the 2010-2011 academic year (second
follow-up).

7

At baseline, we administered written assessments in mathematics and French to a random
sample of 6 children in each of grades 2 and 4, and an oral reading assessment (similar to Early
Grade Reading Assessment, or EGRA) to a random sample of 3 of those 6 children in grades 2
and 4. Importantly, the same tests were administered across all waves. In addition, we randomly
selected 2 of the 3 children in each grade who took all three assessments, and conducted a household
survey that included demographic and financial information on all household members. Finally, we
collected classroom and school level information by surveying the school principals and the teachers
of the students in our sample.
In the first follow-up, we surveyed and tested the same children again (at the start of 3rd and
5th grade, respectively) and their households, teachers and principals. Schools who received grants
in the first cohort answered a set of questions on the use of the extra funds. To examine the
possibility that funds were disproportionately channelled to students preparing to enter secondary
school, we also administered written assessments in mathematics and French to a random sample
of children who were in 6th grade at follow-up, and also surveyed their teachers.
In the second follow-up, we re-surveyed and tested the same children who were tested at baseline
and first follow-up, and we also tested a random sample of 2nd, 4th, and 6th grade students in
French and mathematics. In addition, in the second follow-up we administered the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test (PPVT) to children and their mothers. We did not collect general school and
classroom information in the second follow-up.
Of the 633 schools, split randomly into three cohorts of 211 schools each, we sampled 525. We
were able to contact 478 schools at baseline (among which 447 were successfully surveyed), 528 at
first follow-up4 (among which 517 were successfully surveyed), and 340 at second follow-up (among
which 325 were successfully surveyed and tested).5 The schools that were not included at baseline
were out of bounds either due to inclement weather or rebel activity in the South. While this
may have impacted the representativeness of the baseline sample, it did not affect the balance as
accessibility was not correlated with treatment status, as we will report later. Due to budgetary
4

We contacted more schools in the first follow-up than we originally sampled because the enumerators accidentally
went to an extra treatment and two extra control schools that we had not originally planned on sampling.
5
See Appendix Table A15 for the corresponding number of student-level observations and attrition. In Appendix
Tables A16 and A17 we show the difference in baseline characteristics between treatment and control schools, for
students who did not leave the sample between baseline and first follow-up or second follow-up, respectively. The
sample is similarly balanced as our main sample (see below).

8

constraints, in the second follow-up we dropped Cohort 2 schools, and ended up with a sample
of 352 schools, of which 325 schools were successfully surveyed and tested. Since cohorts were
randomly allocated, this did not introduce bias.
The first column of Panel A of Table 1 shows means and standard deviations of baseline test
scores for females in grade 2 of control schools. The third column shows the same results for
boys (analogous results for grade 4 are in Appendix Table 1, and the full distribution of scores is
in Appendix B). The French, mathematics, and oral tests were appropriately targeted to student
grade level, as mean scores (calculated as the proportion of correct responses on the exam) were
around 30-40 percent. The same tests were administered at first follow-up, so these scores allowed
room for noticeable improvement. The fourth row corresponds to an index of the three tests (which
is the first principal component of these three tests, standardized to have unit variance).
Panel B shows household characteristics of the students. On average these students live less
than a kilometer from the school and miss one day of school per month. Their households spend a
fair amount of their income on education expenses as compared to household food consumption, and
over half of the parents claim to be involved in school activities. Only 10 percent of the household
interviews were conducted in French.
Panel C reports school characteristics. The average school in our sample is not small: it has 347
students and 10 teachers, half of whom hold a baccalaureate degree and half of whom participated
in training in the five years preceding the intervention. The schools are varied in their resources:
56 percent have electricity, and 23 percent have a library. Three-quarters of principals have a
baccalaureate degree.
The second and fourth columns in panels A and B show the differences in test scores and school
characteristics between treatment and control at baseline, for both males and females. The second
column of panel C shows differences in household characteristics between treatment and control. All
but one difference (parental involvement in school) are insignificant. Thus treatment and control
are very well balanced. It is noteworthy that the precision of the difference in test scores is very
high, which bodes very well for our ability to detect even small effects of the program.6
6
With the exception of the index score, we chose not to standardize the mathematics, French, and oral scores.
The tests were designed to appropriately measure the types of skills taught in the first years of elementary school,
and looking at the proportion of right answers in this test is a natural way to assess student knowledge in these
subjects, and its progress over time. Furthermore, these scores are specific to Senegal, so standardization would not
be useful for international comparisons. Even within sample, we show below that the distribution of scores is highly

As we explained above, some schools were inaccessible at baseline, and thus were only added
to the survey in the first follow up (although they participated in the randomization, and the
treatment schools in this group were funded as planned). The exclusion from baseline was unrelated
to treatment status, which explains why nevertheless baseline schools are balanced. In Appendix
Table A2 we present descriptive statistics for all schools including those added at the first follow
up. As we expect, when we compare the characteristics of treatment and control schools which
we did not expect to change as a result of the experiment there is no significant difference, other
than possibly in distance from school. However this is just one significant difference among many
differences; jointly there are no differences and this one is very small in magnitude. Hence, whether
we look at schools surveyed at baseline or at the first followup, there is no evidence of imbalances
between treatment and control with respect to their baseline characteristics.
Another concern is that these 633 schools may be fundamentally different from other primary
schools in Senegal as a result of the grant selection process (e.g., these schools were better organized
to put together a good grant application). Thus, they may not constitute a random set of schools
in Senegal and the results of this study may not generalize. In Appendix Table A3, we show
characteristics of a nationally representative sample of Senegalese households using data collected
in 2006 by PASEC (Programme on the Analysis of Education Systems), a survey aimed at assessing
educational attainment in primary school, and variables that correspond to those in our data.
Schools in our sample have fewer students and are more likely to have electricity than the average
school in Senegal, but are similar on other measures, including the literacy rates, the number
of teachers and their education, and whether the school has a library. At least in terms of these
variables, our sample does not look drastically different from the average Senegalese primary school.

Empirical Approach and Inference

We use a regression approach to estimate the impacts of the program. Specifically, the impacts are
the estimated βtk coefficients7 from the following regression:
k
Yist
= αtk + βtk Gs + Xis λt + εkist

(1)

non-normal, so a one standard deviation in test scores does not have the usual meaning. Nevertheless, in Appendix
C we replicate our main results using standardized test scores.
7
Appendix Table A4 reports results using standardized test scores.

12

k is the proportion of correct answers in test k, for student i in school s at follow up t (1
where Yist

or 2), Gs is a treatment indicator, Xis are conditioning variables measured at baseline, and εkist is
an error term. Conditioning variables include household size, number of children, whether the head
has any education, distance to school, a wealth index8 , the interview language, and the baseline
scores of all tests. Since household interviews were conducted for only a random subsample of
students, two-thirds of our sample has missing household characteristics (at random). In order to
keep these observations, we assign zeros to conditioning variables if they are missing and include
dummies for observations with missing conditioning variables.9
Since we are testing multiple hypotheses at once we compute levels of significance for each
coefficient using the step-down approach of Romano and Wolf (2005). In this way we control for
the family-wise error rate (FWE). The FWE is defined as the probability of incorrectly identifying
at least one coefficient as significant, which becomes more likely as the number of hypothesis tests
increases. The Romano-Wolf approach improves upon more conservative classical methods such
as the Bonferroni correction by applying a “step-down” algorithm that takes advantage of the
dependence structure of individual tests. Our approach is to control for a FWE of 5 and 10 percent
and mark each coefficient that is significant at each of these rates with ** and * respectively.
However, testing too many hypotheses at once may reduce power to detect anything significant.
We thus test multiple hypotheses in related groups rather than for all effects reported in the paper.
We also present bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals, clustered at the school level. They
may exclude zero, pointing to a coefficient that is significant at a 5% level, while the multiple-testing
adjusted p-value may be above 5% or even above 10%. This is perfectly consistent because the
p-value is adjusted for multiple testing, while inference based on the 95% CI only corresponds to a
5% level of significance if no other hypothesis is tested.

The wealth index is standardized to have unit variance and is defined as the first principal component of the
following variables: the home has electricity, the home has plumbing, the home has a radio, the home has a television,
the home has a telephone, the home has a computer, the home has a refrigerator, the home has gas, the home has
an iron, the home has a bicycle, the home has an automobile, the home has a bed, the home has a modern toilet,
the number of chickens, the number of sheep, the number of cows, the number of horses, the number of donkeys,
the amount of land, savings, debt, food expenditure, child expenditure, other expenditure, wall material, ground
material, and roof material.

Results without conditioning variables are presented in Appendix C and they are almost identical, but of course

Impacts on Test Scores for Boys and Girls

In Table 2 we present estimates of the difference between third grade test scores in treatment and
control schools, measured at first follow-up (beginning of third grade) in Panel A, and at second
follow-up (end of third grade) in Panel B.
As explained above, at first follow-up we have measurements of student performance in written tests in French and mathematics, as well as an oral test that covers sound, letter and word
recognition, and reading comprehension, but (for cost reasons) was only administered to a third of
the students who take written tests. For each of these three tests we compute the proportion of
correct answers given by each student. In addition, we use the first principal component as a summary index of these three tests, which is standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation
1. For the second follow-up, we also have scores for the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, which
is standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation 1 (within sample).
Before proceeding to a more detailed analysis of the impacts, we first note that the effects of the
program for third grade students on the entire set of 42 main outcomes we consider10 are jointly
significant with a p-value of 0.02. This conclusion is based on a χ2 type test with critical values
derived using the bootstrap. Thus the intervention had an overall significant effect on third grade
outcomes.
We start with the results for children who were in third grade at the first follow up, one year
after the intervention started. Panel A of Table 2 has 4 columns, one for each of the three tests,
and one for the aggregate index of all tests. There are two rows. The first presents the estimates
for female students and the second presents estimates for males. Each cell displays estimates of βtk ,
the corresponding 95% bootstrap confidence interval, and significance stars based on the Romano
and Wolf (2005) procedure.
There are large impacts of school grants on third grade test scores of girls. This is true across
all tests. Impacts range from an increase of over 3 (math) to almost 5 (oral) percentage points in
the proportion of correct answers in each test. These are large effects in light of the means (and
10

The outcomes jointly tested include the 3 tests for boys and girls in both followups plus the PPVT in the second
follow-up. We consider a national sample (14 hypotheses), and a sample split between the north and south of the
country (28 hypotheses), for a total of 42 hypotheses.

Bootstrapped confidence intervals in square brackets are calculated using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles
of the bootstrap distribution and are adjusted for clustering. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01
correspond to Romano Wolf (2005) p-values from a joint test (see text for included hypotheses).
Conditioning variables: Household size, number of children, education of head, distance to school,
wealth index, interview language, baseline scores, missing dummies. In the first follow-up, overall
means of French, math, and oral tests are 0.540, 0.538, and 0.351 for females and 0.546, 0.564, and
0.376 for males, respectively. In the second follow-up, overall means of French, math, oral, and
(standardized) PPVT tests are 0.678, 0.678, 0.463, and -0.030 for females and 0.685, 0.696, 0.474,
and 0.025 for males, respectively.

standard deviations) of these test scores: 0.54 (0.24) for both written French and written math, and
0.35 (0.22) for the oral test. If we view all of these tests as noisy measurements of one underlying
human capital factor we may improve precision by using the first principal component computed
using factor analysis. When we look at this aggregate index of the three tests, the school grant
increases third grade school performance of females by 0.22 of a standard deviation.
All of these effects are individually significant (i.e. the 95% confidence interval does not include
zero) for girls, but none are for boys, where the effects are much smaller and the index points to no
overall improvement. To evaluate the statistical significance of these effects as a group, as explained
above, we first carry out a joint χ2 test for all effects reported in Table 2 (excluding the index).
Jointly these effects are significant at the 2% level. To pinpoint which effects are responsible for
the overall rejection of the null hypothesis, we implement the Romano and Wolf (2005) procedure
and find that the oral test for girls is significant at the 10% level but none of the other effects
are significant.11 However, the effect on the aggregate index for girls, which effectively filters out
measurement error, is still significant at the 5% level once we control for multiple testing.12 Taken
together, these results imply substantial, sizable and significant effects on the performance for girls
but did not change the overall performance of boys.
Panel B of Table 2 documents program impacts measured using test scores at the end of third
grade for the same students (the second follow-up). In addition to the three tests and the index
described above, column 5 shows the impact on PPVT scores, standardized to have mean zero and
standard deviation 1 in the sample.
Impacts of the program for boys are again positive but much smaller than for girls, below 2.6
percentage points for all tests considered (about 0.08 of a standard deviation for the index). These
are not significant by any criterion.
For females, impact sizes are similar to those reported in Panel A of Table 2, if not larger, with
the exception of math. This indicates that program impacts persisted two years after the grant was
disbursed to schools. The effects we report for girls are all individually significant, except for the
PPVT and mathematics in the second follow up. However, we note that, based on the step-down

p-values, the effects are not significant in the second followup (albeit the sample used is smaller,
since we could not use cohort 2 schools).13 Our interpretation of these results is that the program
seems to be improving the performance of girls who, at the start of the program, were in second
grade (and tested at the beginning and the end of third grade).
It is interesting that a relatively small grant is able to improve children’s learning outcomes
to this extent, especially for girls. By contrast, in Glewwe and Kremer’s (2006) survey of the
recent literature on the effectiveness of improvements in school resources on students’ learning in
developing countries, there are several interventions that show no significant impact. In developed
countries, there are even fewer examples of successful school resource interventions (Hanushek
(2006)).
It is possible that the intervention improved outcomes because it provided cash in a decentralized
way to local decision makers, who could then put these funds to an efficient use. Nevertheless, there
is abundant evidence of leakages in other similar grant programs across the world (Reinikka and
Svensson (2004), Bruns et al. (2011)). If the extent of local capture of these funds is also substantial
in Senegal then the results in this paper are even more remarkable because they would have been
produced with minimal resources.
Whether the program has different effects across the distribution is an important question
relating to targeting. In Figure 4 we show parameter estimates together with their 95% confidence
intervals from a quantile regression of the relevant test scores for grade three in the first follow
up, on the treatment indicator and including the usual controls, clustered by school. For girls the
effects of the grant are spread over most of the distribution, except at the very top. For boys these
results confirm no effect along the entire distribution.
A similar picture emerges for the second follow up in Figure 5, although the results are unfortunately less precise because of the smaller sample size. Finally, estimates of the grant on PPVT
scores occur mainly in the middle of the distribution, for boys. No other effect is observed for boys
on the remaining test scores.
We also estimated the main effects for children who were at grade 5 in the two followups in
Table 3. The impacts are numerically close to zero and statistically insignificant by any criterion.14
13

Notice that all the individual confidence intervals increase relatively to those in Panel A.
Appendix Table A6 resports these effects without controls, as well as the impacts of school grants on test scores
of children in other grades for which we collected test scores but no other data.

It is remarkable that there are only (individually) statistically significant program impacts (either
positive or negative) on grade 3 tests. The standard errors of the estimates are similar across
grades, but the point estimates are quite small across all tests, grades, and survey waves, with the
exception of grade 3.15

The index and PPVT columns are in standardized units.

Bootstrapped confidence intervals in square brackets are calculated using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles
of the bootstrap distribution and are adjusted for clustering. Conditioning variables: Household
size, number of children, education of head, distance to school, wealth index, interview language,
baseline scores, missing dummies. In the first follow-up, overall means of French, math, and oral
tests are 0.470, 0.417, and 0.628 for females and 0.490, 0.459, and 0.659 for males, respectively.
In the second follow-up, overall means of French, math, oral, and (standardized) PPVT tests are
0.590, 0.543, 0.705, and -0.022 for females and 0.601, 0.580, 0.743, and 0.030 for males, respectively.

This is a very puzzling finding. It is possible that a belief that learning delays emerge early in
the life of the child, and that in the early stages of school it is central to build a strong foundation
for future learning, leads principals to invest in earlier grades more than in later grades. This seems
to be a widespread belief among elementary school principals in Senegal.
Using data from the teachers’ questionnaires at follow-up we investigate whether there were
differential impacts of school grants on observable investments in 3rd and 5th grade students in
15

Therefore, the lack of statistically significant results in grade 5 (but not in grade 3) does not appear to be due to
a lack of power. If the point estimates for grade 5 were as large as those for grade 3 it is likely that we would be able
to reject that they were statistically equal to zero. When designing our study we anticipated that with our sample
we would be able to detect program impacts of between 0.2 and 0.3 standard deviations, which is in line with what
we find.

20

Panel A of Appendix Table A7.16 Some of the variables we can study are classroom materials (e.g.,
textbooks/manuals, desks, tables, etc), and teacher training. We find no differential impact of the
program in any of these. When we examine other classroom characteristics or teacher behaviors,
the only interesting difference to report concerns student (mis-)behavior in the classroom. While
in third grade there was a positive impact of the program on student behavior as measured by
the number of times a day a teacher needs to demand silence, in fifth grade there was a negative
impact of the program on student behavior measured by this variable, and by the number of times
a teacher has to punish a child for impolite behavior.
It is also possible that parents believe that investments in the early grades are more productive
than investments in later grades. If that were true it could happen that parents decreased their
home investments (if they were substitutes with school investments) more in later grades than in
earlier grades in response to an increase in school resources. However, once again, there is no
evidence that this took place, at least in terms of observable parental investments (see Panel B of
Appendix Table A7).

5.2

Heterogenous Impacts

There are important differences in the impact of school grants on the test scores of boys and girls.
Here we consider two additional characteristics by which the impact of the school grants may
plausibly differ: prior ability and region (the South is much poorer and geographically distinct
from the North).
For baseline ability, we convert corresponding baseline test scores into a ”high” (above median)
or ”low” (below median) binary variable. However, as we mentioned above, several schools were
missing at baseline. In Appendix Table A8 we show that missing schools at baseline are mainly in
the South, and that they display worse student performance in the first follow-up than comparable
non-missing schools. It is noteworthy that they are not disproportionately control or treatment
schools.
For region, we distinguish schools located in the most southern regions in Senegal (Ziguinchor
and Kolda) from schools in the rest of the country. We consider these regions separately because
Ziguinchor and Kolda are much poorer regions (ANSD (2007)) and have been beset by problems
16

Ideally we would want to do this using 2nd and, say, 4th grade students, but we do not have the follow-up data
for these teachers, although we have baseline data for them.

21

related to rebel activity.
Since our larger estimates of program impacts were for students in 3rd grade, who were first
exposed to the program in 2nd grade, we focus this analysis of heterogeneous impacts on them. A
similar analysis performed on the test results of students in 5th grade did not produce evidence of
any program impacts for this set of students (see Appendix Tables A9 and A10).

Tables 4 and 5 have two panels, corresponding to Wist =”Baseline ability” and Wist =”Region”,
respectively. Each panel reports the treatment effect for each Wist (δtk ) and the 95% bootstrapped
confidence interval, clustered at the school level. The final row reports the p-value of the difference
between the estimated treatment effects for high and low ability children.
The first panel of Table 4 shows that the impact of school grants on 3rd grade French scores is
especially large for girls with a high level of baseline ability in French. This is consistent with the
idea that investments in skills are complementary over time and hence will be more productive for
those with high levels of skill to start with. There are several education interventions that share
this characteristic.
There are also several education interventions that benefit mostly girls. It is much less common
to find programs that affect boys alone. Again, this could be related to the skills that girls bring to
elementary schools, such as discipline, patience, and higher levels of maturity overall, which may
make them better able to enjoy the benefits of additional school resources, such as a better teacher,
better training manuals, a library, and so on.
We now turn to differences by North and South of the country, two very different regions. In
Tables A12 and A13 of the appendix we show that the samples are balanced within each geographic
region. There are dramatic differences in program impacts depending on whether the school is
located in the South of the country (which are poorer and have worse school results) or in the
North (Table 5, or see Appendix Table A11 for standardized coefficients). In fact, if we focus on
3rd grade French scores, there are no statistically significant impacts of the program in the North of
the country, whereas in the South they are very large, even among boys. For example, as a result of
the program, girls in southern schools are able to increase the proportion of correct answers by 12.5
percentage points, which is over 0.5 of a standard deviation. These effects are qualitatively similar
for other tests and persist through the end of the grade (second follow-up). When we examine all
of the tests and correct the p-values for multiple testing, the impacts remain significant despite the
high number of hypotheses tested. In addition, we still find no effects for fifth graders (Appendix
25

Tables A9 and A10).
The South-North differences in estimates of the impact of school grants are striking. It may be
the case that the types of investments made in response to the grants varied by region and took
different amounts of time to manifest themselves in test scores. In the remainder of the paper we
examine whether there are differences between what school principals, teachers, and parents did in
response to the availability of school grants in each of these areas, which could help shed light on
the sources of regional differences in the impacts of the program on the performance of students.

5.3

Understanding Differences Between South and North

We start by examining baseline test performance differences of third grade students between schools
in the South and in the North. These are shown in Table 6, panel A. Students in the southern
schools perform worse on almost all tests than their counterparts in the North. This is particularly
true for girls. For control schools in the first follow-up, documented in panel B, the differences
between the North and the South are much larger, they hold across gender groups, and they always
show larger scores in the North. A possible interpretation of this is that schools in the south had
more room for improvement than schools in the North. However, this interpretation conflicts with
the finding that program impacts are larger for students with high baseline test scores.
Next, we examine differences in household and project characteristics in Table 7. Panel A
compares household characteristics of students in the South and in the North. Because of the
missing schools at baseline, we take characteristics measured in the first follow-up among students
in the control schools. A few interesting patterns emerge. Households in the south are poorer but
have fewer children and better educated heads (and more prominently so for the families of female
students).
Panel B of Table 7 considers the characteristics of projects being undertaken by schools with the
school grant funds. This information comes from a survey conducted in treatment schools which
asked principals about the project for which they got funding. We conducted two of these surveys,
one at first follow-up, and one at second follow-up. We report estimates from the second follow-up
survey when, presumably, data about the project is more mature and complete.
In the South, students were much more frequently named as participants in the drafting of the
proposal. Although it is not clear what input students may have had, this could indicate that

principals were more sensitive to the needs of the students in the South. It is also significant that
projects in the South started later. By the end of year 2 of the study projects in the North had
been running 7.6 months longer than in the South. If results faded out quickly this could explain
why we observe effects of the more recent projects than in the earlier projects but this is unlikely to
be the case, given our previous results about the sustainability of program impacts (although those
are not very precise). If, on the other hand, a project needed time before it started to influence
children’s learning (as in the case of activities that take time, such as training a teacher, or building
a library), we would expect larger impacts for more mature projects, which goes against what we
find in terms of the South - North comparison.
Some of the most remarkable differences relate to the components of the project. The schools in
the North were more likely to have components involving the purchase of textbooks/manuals and
other educational materials, while schools in the South were much more likely to have components
related to training of teachers and of the management committee. This is also reflected in the
amounts schools reported the project spent on principals, teachers, the management committee,
and the students. Thus there are clear differences in the characteristics of projects in schools in the
North and the South, as stated by the principals of these schools. Schools in the South seem to be
investing more in the teaching and management abilities of their human resources, while schools
in the North invest more in materials. This may well be a force behind the large differences in
program impacts in these two sets of schools.
Table 8 reports the impact of the program on principals’ (panel A) and teachers’ (panel B)
behaviors. We present separate estimates of program impacts in the South and in the North, and
test whether differences in program impacts in these two areas are equal to zero (column 3).
As expected, there are no broad impacts of the school grants on aspects of school infrastructure.
This was expected because, as we mentioned above, the projects had to have exclusively a pedagogical emphasis. However one aspect that can be considered infrastructure was very significantly
affected by school grants both in the North and in the South: the existence of a library in the
school. While the impact is twice as large in the South as in the North, we cannot reject that the
two impacts are statistically equal. In addition, schools in the North that received a school grant
spent more money on electricity and water for the school.
Regarding school materials and training, we see that the school grants caused an increase in

books in the library in the North and an increase in the amount spent on manuals in both regions.
In contrast, schools in the South spent substantially more in tutoring while both sets of schools
increased spending on teacher training. All this is very much consistent with the way principals
described the grant projects, as reported in Table 7. While the point estimates reveal differences
in direction in the North and South, it is difficult to be conclusive since none of the impacts are
significantly different between the two (except expenditure on electricity and water).
It is also interesting that there was an increase in the number of students in the North (perhaps
attracted by more school materials) which is not matched by an equally large increase in the
number of teachers, and which could lead to a dilution of treatment effects. In the South both
these quantities go down, but not significantly. Nevertheless, it is not easy to explain how these
changes in class size came about.
Finally, school grants decreased teacher turnover, particularly in the South. Given that teachers
are likely to be the most important input in the school production function, the fact that in the
South the program significantly affected the amount of training they got and how likely they were
to remain in the school from one year to the next, is consistent with the finding of strong program
impacts on student performance in this region of the country.
One final and important thing to report is that, as a result of the grant, the behavior of students
seems to have improved considerably in the South, but not in the North: treatment affected how
often teachers have to ask for silence during the day in southern schools. This mimics what we found
before when we compared 3rd and 5th grade teacher reports (see Appendix Table A7). Student
behavior improved among 3rd graders but not among 5th graders, which is exactly what happened
in terms of test results. It is difficult to say whether test results improved because teachers were
able to improve student behavior, or whether teachers who are good at teaching reading and math
are also able to improve behaviors in their students.
We also examined the impact of the program on household behaviors in the South and in the
North, which is shown in Appendix Table A14. It could happen that households in the North
reacted differently to the availability of school grants than those in the South, say, by investing less
(substitution) in their children (which would then help explain the pattern of test results). However,
this did not happen. There are no noteworthy impacts of the program on household behaviors, and
they do not seem to vary with the region of the country where households are located.
31

The resulting picture from this section is mixed. There are several differences between the south
and the north: households are poorer yet more educated households in the south, and projects in
the south tended to focus on training and less on information technology. However, when we look at
the impact of the grant on how schools use the money, there are no obviously significant differences
between the north and south. Nevertheless, the improvement in behavior in the south is remarkable
and one can expect that fewer classroom disruptions - perhaps due to teacher training - can help
learning.

Conclusions

There is substantial debate about the importance of resources in schools for student performance.
More often than not, increases in school resources are not associated with increases in student
performance. One reason may be that central education authorities lack an understanding of the
needs of schools. Principals, on the other hand, could have better information and could target
resources more efficiently. The danger is that incentives to improve student performance may vary
across school principals and there may be several sources of local pressures for alternative uses of
these funds.
This paper studies the impact of a school grant program on student performance and on potential mechanisms that could underlie the change in school performance induced by such a program.
We find impacts of school grants on student learning, especially on girls with high ability levels
at baseline. Notably, these impacts persist over the two years of our evaluation. However, these
impacts occur only in third grade, as opposed to later grades, and they are stronger in the South
of the country. These results suggest that resources distributed in a decentralized manner can have
positive impacts on students.
While it is difficult to explain the grade differential in program impacts, one conjecture is that
principals focus on earlier grades because they see there the foundations for future learning. We
can say a bit more, however, about the North-South difference in program impacts, based on
how we see principals spending their resources. While schools in the North emphasized manuals
and other education materials, schools in the South emphasized human resources, namely through
the training of teachers and school administrators. Our results suggest that the latter type of
investments, although perhaps less visible to the local community (and therefore less preferred by
32

say, local politicians, or even local school authorities), is likely to be more effective than the former
type of investments. This result is also consistent with the idea that the main determinant of school
quality is teachers, not equipment, as suggested by the most recent literature on this topic (e.g.,
Hanushek and Rivkin (2006)).

Online Appendix: Not for Publication
A. Primary Education in Senegal: School Grants Program
Senegal is investing a large portion of public expenditures in education (6 percent of GDP in 2009).
About 90 percent of the budget is geared towards teacher salaries. Yet, despite these resources,
results have been slow to materialize. While access to primary education has increased (gross
enrollment rates reached 92 percent in 2009), primary completion rates remain low (57 percent in
2009).
Senegal’s education decentralization policy dates back to 1972. A decree in 2002 established
school management committees (Comite de Gestion des Ecoles), which are composed of representatives of the village chief, the commune, the Parents’ Association, the local sports and cultural
association, school directors, teachers, and others. The CGEs’ central role is to manage and supervise the implementation of school grants. Other education management aspects, such as teacher
salaries, continue to be steered at the central level.

B. Test Score Distributions
In this appendix we document the way the distribution of test scores changed over time and as a
result of the experiment. The first panel of Figure A1 shows the densities of scores in the French
written test taken by girls in 2nd grade at baseline, first follow-up, and second follow-up. The
dashed lines in the figures correspond to the control schools while the solid lines are the treatment
schools. The second panel of Figure A1 shows the corresponding figure for boys. As expected given
earlier results, the thinnest, lightest lines show that the distributions of test scores are balanced for
treatment and control at baseline (beginning of second grade) for children of both genders.
The lines with a medium level of thickness correspond to the densities of scores at the beginning
of third grade at first follow-up. Again, the dashed lines correspond to control schools, and the
solid lines correspond to treatment schools. Although the densities of test scores are balanced at
baseline, they are different at first follow-up, especially for girls, indicating that the program has an
impact on this group of children. Notice also that students in the first follow-up have a much higher
(and statistically significant) proportion of correct answers than at baseline (recall that they take
the same test in both occasions). Given that the baseline takes place at the beginning of second
grade, and the first follow-up at the beginning of third grade, this is expected if schools provide
knowledge about the test material. Notice also that program impacts are smaller for boys.
The thickest lines in Figure A1 correspond to the densities of scores for the second follow-up,
conducted at the end of third grade. We use the same test as in the previous two waves. Like before,
the evolution of test scores shows (statistically significant) learning during third grade. Program
impacts remain strong for girls towards the end of the third grade, roughly two years after the
funds were disbursed to the treatment schools.
Figures A2 and A3 show that this is also true if we examine math and oral tests.

Analagously, in Figures A4, A5, and A6, we display the densities of scores at first and second
follow-up for boys and girls who were in fourth grade at baseline (and in fifth grade in the subsequent
year). The differences between treatment and control schools are smaller than the ones we document
for grade 3, especially when we consider girls. In the main body of the paper we show that there
is no statistically significant impact of school grants on fifth grade test scores.

*Attrition in the second follow-up is based on cohorts 1 and 3, since cohort 2 schools were
dropped in the second follow-up. A student in the second follow-up has attrited if they
have a baseline test score but not a second follow-up test score (regardless of their status
in the first follow-up).
