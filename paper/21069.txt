ABSTRACT
In this paper we analyze the relationship between turnover-driven growth and subjective wellbeing,
using cross-sectional MSA level US data. We find that the effect of creative destruction on wellbeing
is (i) unambiguously positive if we control for MSA-level unemployment, less so if we do not; (ii)
more positive on future wellbeing than on current well-being; (iii) more positive in MSAs with faster
growing industries or with industries that are less prone to outsourcing; (iv) more positive in MSAs
within states with more generous unemployment insurance policies.

Introduction

Does higher (per capita) GDP or GDP growth increase happiness? The existing empirical literature
on happiness and income looks at how various measures of subjective wellbeing relate to income or
income growth, but without going into further details of what drives the growth process.
In his 1974 seminal work, Richard Easterlin provides evidence to the e¤ect that, within a given
country, happiness is positively correlated with income across individuals but this correlation no
longer holds within a given country over time.1 This Easterlin paradox is often explained by the
idea that, at least past a certain income threshold, additional income enters life satisfaction only
in a relative way;2 Clark et al. (2008) provided a review of this large literature of which Luttmer
(2005), Clark and Senik (2010), and Card et al. (2012) are prominent examples. Recent work has
found little evidence of thresholds and a good deal of evidence linking higher incomes to higher life
satisfaction, both across countries and over time. Thus in his cross-country analysis of the Gallup
World Poll, Deaton (2008) …nds a relationship between log of per capita GDP and life satisfaction
which is positive and close to linear, i.e. with a similar slope for poor and rich countries, and
if anything steeper for rich countries. Stevenson and Wolfers (2013) provide both cross-country
and within-country evidence of a log-linear relationship between per capita GDP and wellbeing
and they also fail to …nd a critical "satiation" income threshold.3 Yet these issues remain far from
settled, see for example the reviews by Frey and Stutzer (2002), Layard (2005) or Graham (2012) as
well as the new work investigating how happiness measures relate to economists’notions of utility
(e.g. see Benjamin et al., 2012). Importantly, however, none of these contributions looks into the
determinants of growth and at how these determinants a¤ect wellbeing. In this paper, we provide
a …rst attempt at …lling this gap.
More speci…cally, we look at how an important engine of growth, namely Schumpeterian creative
destruction with its resulting ‡ow of entry and exit of …rms and jobs, a¤ects subjective wellbeing
di¤erently for di¤erent types of individuals and in di¤erent types of labor markets.
Thus, in the …rst part of the paper we develop a simple Schumpeterian model of growth and
unemployment to organize our thoughts and generate predictions on the potential e¤ects of turnover
1

Easterlin’s results have been much debated. Even the importance of income to explain life satisfaction variation
across individuals has been sometimes quali…ed. Blanch‡ower and Oswald (2004) argue that life events such as
unemployment or marital status have larger e¤ects than income. Di Tella et al (2007) show that the e¤ect of an
income shock on life satisfaction is only temporary: 65% of the e¤ect disappears within four years.
2
In other words, provided you can ful…ll basic needs, what really matters for happiness is to be richer than one’s
neighbors or reference person.
3
Interestingly, Deaton and Stone (2013) show that income impacts di¤erently di¤erent measures of wellbeing
but argue that relative income and wellbeing remains a puzzle of the literature. They distinguish between hedonic
wellbeing (“did you experience a lot of happiness yesterday?), which could be consistent with a relative income story,
and evaluative wellbeing (as measured by how individuals assess their lives on a 0 to 10 ladder), which is more closely
related to absolute income.

on life satisfaction. In this model growth results from quality-improving innovations. Each time
a new innovator enters a sector, the worker currently employed in that sector loses her job and
the …rm posts a new vacancy. Production in the sector resumes with the new technology only
when the …rm has found a new suitable worker.

Life satisfaction is proxied by the expected

discounted valuation of an individual’s future earnings. In the model a higher rate of turnover
has both direct and indirect e¤ects on life satisfaction. The direct e¤ects are that, everything
else equal, more turnover translates into both, a higher probability of becoming unemployed for
the employed which reduces life satisfaction, and a higher probability for the unemployed to …nd
a new job, which increases life satisfaction. The indirect e¤ect is that a higher rate of turnover
implies a higher growth externality and therefore a higher net present value of future earnings: this
enhances life satisfaction. Overall, a …rst prediction of the model is that a higher turnover rate
increases wellbeing more when controlling for aggregate unemployment, than when not controlling
for aggregate unemployment. A second prediction is that higher turnover increases wellbeing more,
the more turnover is associated with growth-enhancing activities. A third prediction is that higher
turnover increases wellbeing more for more forward-looking individuals. A fourth prediction is that
higher turnover increases wellbeing more, the more generous are unemployment bene…ts.4
In the second part of the paper we test the predictions of the model using cross-section MSAlevel US data. To measure creative destruction we follow Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996)
and use their measure of job turnover, de…ned as the job creation rate plus the job destruction
rate.5 The data come from the Census’Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) and are at the MSA
level. For robustness checks, we also use the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
data from the Census, which provides information on hires, separations, employment, and thus
turnover, also at the MSA-level. To measure subjective wellbeing, we use the life satisfaction index
from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and the Cantril ladder of life from
the Gallup Healthways Wellbeing Index (Gallup), which asks about both current and anticipated
well-being. The BRFSS measure is constructed using the question "In general how satis…ed are
you with your life?"; the Cantril ladder is based on the following questions: "Imagine a ladder with
steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top; the top of the ladder represents the best
possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On
which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time? And which level
of the ladder do you anticipate to achieve in …ve years?" Another measure of wellbeing we also
4
In the Appendix we characterize the transitional dynamics of the model, and also extend the analysis to the case
where job destruction can be partly exogenous, or to the case where the turnover rate is endogenously determined
by a free entry condition.
5
We have also looked at …rm turnover, namely the sum of the establishment entry rate and the establishment exit
rate, with similar results.

consider using the Gallup database, as it could more directly capture how individuals react to the
risk involved in creative destruction, is the "worry" measure based on individual answers to the
question: "Did you experience worry during a lot of the day yesterday?".
We investigate whether Schumpeterian creative destruction a¤ects all these measures of wellbeing positively or negatively, by regressing our measures of subjective wellbeing on our creative
destruction variables. Our main …nding is that the e¤ect of the turnover rate on wellbeing is unambiguously positive when we control for unemployment. This result is consistent with the theory,
and it is remarkably robust. In particular it holds: (i) whether looking at wellbeing at MSA-level
or at individual level; (ii) whether looking at the life satisfaction measure from the BRFSS or at the
Cantril Ladder measures from the Gallup survey; (iii) whether using the BDS or the LEHD data
to construct our proxy for creative destruction. We also …nd that the positive e¤ect of turnover
is stronger on anticipated wellbeing than on current wellbeing. On the other hand, creative destruction increases individuals’ worry - which re‡ects the fact that more creative destruction is
associated with higher perceived risk by individuals. Next, when interacting creative destruction
with MSA-level industry characteristics; we …nd that the positive e¤ect of turnover on wellbeing
is stronger in MSAs with above median productivity growth or with below median outsourcing
trends. Finally, we …nd that higher turnover increases wellbeing more in states with unemployment
insurance policies that are more generous than the median.
The paper relates to two main strands of literature. First, to the literature on subjective
wellbeing. There, as mentioned above, we contribute by looking at the channels whereby innovationled growth a¤ects wellbeing. Second, to the literature on growth, job turnover and unemployment.6
In particular this literature points to two opposite e¤ects of growth on unemployment. One is a
"capitalization" e¤ect whereby more growth reduces the rate at which …rms discount the future
returns from creating a new vacancy: this e¤ect pushes towards creating more vacancies and
thus towards reducing the equilibrium unemployment. The counteracting e¤ect is a "creative
destruction" e¤ect whereby more growth implies a higher rate of job destruction which in turn
tends to increase the equilibrium level of unemployment. We contribute to this literature by
looking at the counteracting e¤ects of innovation-led growth on subjective wellbeing.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the model and
generates predictions on the e¤ects of turnover on subjective wellbeing, and how these e¤ects
depend upon individual or local labor market characteristics. Section 3 describes the data, the
approach underlying the empirical analysis, and presents the empirical results. Section 4 concludes.
The Appendix contains extensions to the baseline framework and all regression tables. Additional
proofs and derivations are included in the Online Appendix.

Theoretical analysis

2.1

A toy model

In this section, we will o¤er a simple model to motivate our empirical analysis. The source of economic growth is Schumpeterian creative destruction which at the same time generates endogenous
obsolescence of …rms and jobs. The workers in the obsolete …rms join the unemployment pool until
they are matched to a new …rm. Higher …rm turnover has both a positive e¤ect (by increasing
economic growth and by increasing employment prospects of unemployed workers) and a negative
e¤ect (by increasing the probability of currently employed workers losing their job) on wellbeing.
Which e¤ect dominates will in turn depend upon both individual characteristics (discount rate,
risk-aversion,...) and characteristics of the labor market (unemployment bene…ts,...). To keep the
analysis tractable, in what follows we will consider a steady-state economy with exogenous entry,
risk neutral agents, and only endogenous job destruction. These assumptions will be relaxed in
the Appendix: Section A focuses on transitional dynamics, B considers a model with exogenous
job destruction, C considers the implications of risk aversion, and D endogeneizes entry in the
theoretical model.
2.1.1

Production technology and innovation

We consider a multi-sector Schumpeterian growth model in continuous time. The economy is
populated by in…nitely-lived and risk-neutral individuals of measure one, and they discount the
future at rate :7 Therefore the household Euler equation is simply
r= ;

(1)

where r is the interest rate of the economy.
The …nal good is produced using a continuum of intermediate inputs, according to the logarithmic production function:
ln Yt =

Z

ln yjt dj

j2J

where J

[0; 1] is the set of active product lines. We will denote its measure by J 2 [0; 1] : The

measure J is invariant in steady state.
Each intermediate …rm produces using one unit of labor according to the following linear production function,
yjt = Ajt ljt ;
7

The analysis in this section can be straightforwardly extended to the case where individuals are risk-averse. See
the Appendix C.

4

where ljt = 1 is the labor employed by the …rm, and is the same in all sectors. Thus the measure
of inactive product lines is equal to the unemployment rate
ut = 1

Jt ;

where u denotes the equilibrium unemployment rate. Our focus will be on balanced growth path
equilibrium, therefore when possible, we will drop time subscripts to save notation.8
2.1.2

Innovation and growth

An innovator in sector j at date t will move productivity in sector j from Ajt
Ajt = Ajt
where

1

to

1;

> 1: The innovator is a new entrant, and entry occurs in each sector with Poisson arrival

rate x which we assume to be exogenous:9 Upon entry in any sector, the previous incumbent …rm
becomes obsolete and its worker loses her job and the entering …rm posts a new vacancy with an
instantaneous cost cY .10 Production in that sector resumes with the new technology when the
…rm has found a new suitable worker. In Appendix B, we extend the model so as to also allow for
exogenous job destruction.
2.1.3

Labor market and job matching

Following Pissarides (1990), we let
m(ut ; vt ) = ut vt1

(2)

denote the arrival rate of new matches between …rms and workers, where ut denotes the number of
unemployed at time t and vt denotes the number of vacancies. Thus the ‡ow probability for each
unemployed worker to …nd a suitable …rm is
m(ut ; vt )=ut ;
whereas the probability for any new entrant …rm to …nd a suitable new worker is
m(ut ; vt )=vt :
In steady state, there will a constant fraction of product lines that are vacant (of measure v), and
the remaining fraction will be producing. We illustrate this economy in Figure 1.
8

In Appendix A, we consider the transitional dynamics. As it is shown there, convergence to the steady state
happens very rapidly, therefore focusing on steady-state of our model is almost without loss of generality.
9
See Appendix D for an extension of the model where we endogeneize entry.
10
In the Online Appendix, we provide su¢ cient conditions under which the incumbent …rm in any sector will choose
to leave the market as soon as a new entrant shows up in that sector. The basic story is that, conditional upon a
new entrant showing up, it becomes pro…table for the incumbent …rm to seek an alternative use of her assets.

5

Finally, we assume that in each intermediate sector where a worker is currently employed, the
worker appropriates fraction

of pro…ts whereas the complementary fraction (1

) accrues to

the employer.

Valuations and life satisfaction

Our proxy for life satisfaction is the average present value of an individual employee, namely:
Wt = ut Ut + (1

ut )Et ;

where Ut is the net present value of an individual who is currently unemployed, and Et is the net
present value of an individual who is currently employed.11
The value of being currently employed, satis…es the asset equation:
Et

E_ t = wt + x(Ut

Et ):

In words: the annuity value of being currently employed is equal to the capital gain E_ t plus the
wage rate wt at time t and with arrival rate x the worker becomes unemployed as the incumbent
…rm is being displaced by a new entrant. Here we already see the negative e¤ect of turnover on
currently employed workers.
Similarly the value of being unemployed satis…es the asset equation:
Ut

U_ t = bt + (m(ut ; vt )=ut )(Et

Ut ):

As before, the annuity value of being currently unemployed is equal to the capital gain U_ t plus the
bene…t bt accruing to an unemployed worker,12 and with arrival rate m(ut ; vt )=ut the unemployed
11
Thus our theoretical measure of subjective wellbeing is the ex ante expected valuation of a representative individual who does not know yet whether she will start being employed or unemployed. In the next section, we shall
argue that the anticipated Cantril ladder is a good empirical proxy for this ex ante valuation indicator.
12
Think of this bene…t term as being the sum of a (monetary) unemployment bene…t and of a private utility (or
disutility) of being currently unemployed.

worker escapes unemployment. For any given unemployment rate, turnover has a positive e¤ect on
the value of unemployed because it creates job opportunities.

2.2

Solving the model

We now proceed to solve the model for equilibrium production and pro…ts, for the equilibrium
steady-state unemployment rate, for the steady-state growth rate, and for the equilibrium value of
life satisfaction.
2.2.1

Static production decision and equilibrium pro…ts

Let wt denote the wage rate at date t. The logarithmic technology for …nal good production implies
that the …nal good producer spends the same amount Yt on each variety j: As a result, the …nal
good production function generates a unit elastic demand with respect to each variety: yjt = Yt =pjt .
Note that the cost of production is simply wjt which is the …rm-speci…c wage rate: Then the
pro…t is simply
jt

= pjt yjt

wjt = Yt

wjt :

Next, the above sharing rule between wage and pro…ts implies that wjt =
wjt = wt =
Clearly

jt

=

(3)
(Yt

wjt ) ; hence

1
Yt = Y:
1+

determines the allocation of income in the economy, with a higher

shifting the income

distribution towards workers.
2.2.2

Steady state equilibrium unemployment

Our focus is on a steady state equilibrium in which all aggregate variables (Yt ; wt ; Ut ; Et ) grow at
the same constant rate g; and where the measure of unemployed u and the number of vacancies
and the interest rate remain constant over time.13 Henceforth, we can drop the time index from
now on.
In steady state, the ‡ow out of unemployment must equal the ‡ow into unemployment. Namely:
m(u; v) = (1

u)x:

(4)

The left-hand side is the ‡ow out of unemployment, the right hand side is the ‡ow into unemployment, equal to the number of active sectors (1

u) time the turnover rate x:

13

In Appendix A, we analyze the transitional dynamics of this model. More speci…cally, we look at the dynamic
impact of a sudden increase in the entry rate. In particular we show that: (i) following that increase in the entry rate
convergence to the steady-state is fast; (ii) the big change in welfare occurs at the time of the increase in entry rate,
and: (iii) the comparative statics on this change is quite similar to the comparative statics on steady-state welfare
stated in Proposition 1 below.

7

In addition, the number of sectors without an employed worker is equal to the number of sectors
with an open vacancy, u = v: Combining this fact with the matching technology (2), we get:
m = u = v:

(5)

Putting these equations (4) and (5) together, we obtain the equilibrium unemployment rate
u = (1

u)x; or equivalently
u=

x
:
1+x

(6)

That the numerator of u be increasing in x re‡ects the job destruction e¤ect of turnover on currently
employed workers; that the denominator be also increasing in x re‡ects the positive e¤ect a higher
turnover rate has on the job …nding rate of currently unemployment workers.
The …rst e¤ect dominates here, with the equilibrium unemployment rate being increasing in
the turnover rate x: However this very much hinges on the fact that innovative turnover is the
only source of job destruction in this baseline model. In Appendix B, we introduce the possibility
of exogenous job destruction on top of innovation-driven job destruction. Then we show that the
higher the exogenous rate of job destruction, the more will the innovation rate x contribute to
reducing unemployment, and therefore the more positive the overall e¤ect of x on equilibrium
wellbeing:
Now we can express the growth rate of the economy.
Lemma 1 The balanced growth path growth rate of the economy is equal to
g = m ln ;
where m denotes the ‡ow of sectors in which a new innovation is being implemented (i.e., the rate
at which new …rm-worker matches occur).
Proof. See the Online Appendix.
Then, using the fact that in steady-state equilibrium we have:
m=u=

x
;
1+x

we get the equilibrium growth rate as,
g=

x
ln :
1+x

(7)

As expected, the growth rate is increasing in the turnover rate x and with the innovation step size
.

2.2.3

Equilibrium valuations and life satisfaction

Recall that our proxy for life satisfaction is the average present value of an individual employee,
namely:
W = uU + (1

u)E;

where:
rE

E_ =

rU

U_

Y + x(U

E); and

= bY + (m(u; v)=u)(E

(8)
U ):

(9)

Now, after substituting for E and U in the expression for W; and using the fact that in steady
state E_ = gE and U_ = gU; and that in equilibrium (see equation (5)) m = u = x=(1 + x), we get
the following expression for life satisfaction:14
W =

Y
r

xB
1+x

g

(10)

where
g=

x
ln
1+x

and B

b:

From the above expression for W; we see three e¤ects of turnover on life satisfaction. First,
for given growth rate g; more turnover increases the probability of an employed worker losing her
current job (numerator in

xB
1+x )

which reduces life satisfaction; second, for given growth rate g; more

turnover increases the probability of an unemployed worker …nding a new job (denominator in

xB
1+x )

which increases life satisfaction; third, higher turnover increases the growth rate g which in turns
acts favorably on life satisfaction: this is the capitalization e¤ect mentioned in the introduction.
The overall e¤ect of turnover on life satisfaction is ambiguous.15
Finally, if we look at the e¤ect of turnover on life satisfaction controlling for unemployment,
this e¤ect is unambiguously positive. To see this, after some straightforward algebra we reexpress
equilibrium welfare W as:
W =

Y
r

g

[ub + (1

(11)

which for given u is increasing in x since it is increasing in g and g is increasing in x (capitalization

Next, life satisfaction increases more with turnover x the more generous unemployment bene…ts18 :

A …nal remark is in order. In our analysis, life satisfaction is not necessarily equal to the
present discounted value of income for at least two reasons. First, even though we labelled b as
unemployment bene…t, the interpretation of it is much more general and it can embody in reality
the private disutility associated with being unemployed or opportunity cost of not working. Second,
our results also hold for the case of risk aversion as we illustrate in Appendix C in which case income
and life satisfaction are distinct objects.
2.2.5

Summary and main predictions

We summarize the above discussion in the following proposition:
Proposition 1 (i) A higher turnover rate x increases life satisfaction W unambiguously once
we control for the unemployment rate, not otherwise; (ii) a higher turnover rate increases life
satisfaction more the lower the discount rate ; (iii) life satisfaction increases more with turnover
x the more generous are unemployment bene…ts.
In the empirical analysis below, we will use cross-MSA data on wellbeing and job turnover to
test the following predictions from the model:
Prediction 1: A higher turnover rate increases wellbeing more when controlling for aggregate
unemployment than when not controlling for aggregate unemployment.
Prediction 2: A higher turnover rate increases wellbeing more, the more turnover is associated
with growth-enhancing activities (i.e, the less it stems from unilateral job destruction).

And in fact life satisfaction increases with turnover when < Bln , and it decreases with turnover otherwise.

Empirical analysis

3.1

Data

The data on creative destruction come from the Business Dynamics Statistics, which provide, at
the metropolitan level (MSA), information on job creation and destruction rates as well as on the
entry and exit rates of establishments.19 These rates are computed from the whole universe of
…rms as described in the Census Longitudinal Business Database. Our main measure of creative
destruction is the "job turnover rate", de…ned as the sum of the job creation and job destruction
rates. We also analyze the role of creation rates and destruction rates separately. We look at
alternative measures of creative destruction in our robustness checks.
The data on subjective wellbeing come from two sources. First, the Gallup Healthways Wellbeing Index, which collects data on 1,000 randomly selected Americans each day through phone
interviews. The period covered is 2008-2011. Subjective wellbeing in Gallup is assessed through
various questions aimed at capturing di¤erent dimensions of wellbeing. Some questions target
the individual’s current emotional state20 and are framed along those lines: "Did you experience
worry/sadness/happiness during a lot of the day yesterday?". Answers are binary, 0 or 1. We use
the "worry" variable, which is the variable most likely to capture the e¤ect of the (unemployment)
risk associated with creative destruction. Alternatively, the "Cantril ladder of life" questions are
destined to measure the individual’s evaluation of her life. Each individual is asked: "Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top; the top of the ladder
represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible
life for you; on which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?";
and then "which level of the ladder do you anticipate to achieve in …ve years?". We refer to answers
to the …rst question as the "current ladder" and to the second one as the "anticipated ladder". The
"anticipated ladder" measure is particularly interesting as we recall that the theoretical wellbeing
indicator W analyzed in the previous section is precisely an expectation, namely the ex ante expected valuation of an individual who does not know yet whether she will start being employed or
unemployed.
19
The job creation (destruction) rate is the sum of all employment gains (losses) from expanding establishments
from year t 1 to year t including establishment startups, divided by the average employment between years t and
t 1.
20
See Deaton and Kahneman (2010) for the distinction between emotional and evaluative wellbeing.

11

The second source of data on subjective wellbeing is the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance
System (BRFSS). The sample size is also roughly 350,000 respondents per year, and the period
covered is 2005-2010. To proxy for subjective well-being in the BRFSS, we use the Life Satisfaction
question: "In general how satis…ed are you with your life?". The possible answers are: "Very
satis…ed"; "Satis…ed"; "Dissatis…ed"; "Very dissatis…ed". We recode these answers so that "Very
dissatis…ed" corresponds to grade 1 and "Very satis…ed" corresponds to grade 4. The descriptive
statistics of our data can be found in Table 1.

3.2

Estimation framework

The model highlights two opposite forces whereby creative destruction impacts subjective wellbeing:
the negative e¤ect that comes from the higher risk of unemployment and the positive e¤ect through
higher growth expectations. A testable prediction of the model is that when regressing subjective
wellbeing measures on creative destruction variables, controlling for the unemployment rate should
capture part of the negative force of creative destruction and thus lead to a more positive coe¢ cient
of creative destruction on wellbeing than without the control for unemployment.
Our measure of creative destruction varies at the MSA level, thus we estimate MSA-level regressions. However, in order to take advantage of our micro-level data on subjective wellbeing, we
also perform individual-level regressions that allow us to have a richer and more meaningful set of
controls.21
In both cases, regressions are OLS and the …rst exercise we perform is to compare the coe¢ cients
from a baseline speci…cation with and without the control for the MSA-level unemployment rate.
We restrict the analysis to working age individuals (18-60 years old) to be closer to the model in
which individuals are either employed or unemployed.22
At the MSA level, we look at purely cross-sectional regressions where we average our subjective
wellbeing data at the MSA-level and across the di¤erent years available: 2005-2010 for the BRFSS
data, and 2008-2011 for the Gallup data. Table 2 focuses on life satisfaction, as measured either by
the BRFSS, or by the current and anticipated ladder of the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing Index.
Table 3 investigates the e¤ect on an alternative dimension of wellbeing: individuals’"worry". In
all cases, we also look at how the e¤ect of creative destruction is decomposed into a "job creation"
e¤ect and a "job destruction" e¤ect.
In Table 4, we allow the unemployment rate to have a non-linear e¤ect on subjective wellbeing
21

Individual characteristics like marital status do not vary much if we aggregate them at the MSA level, yet they
are very important determinants of wellbeing at the individual level.
22
However, we performed all the regressions for the whole population as well, which yields very similar results.

12

by introducing a cubic polynomial of the unemployment rate in the regressions. In Tables 5 and 6,
we control for income per capita. Our preferred way of doing so is by using MSA-level averages of
the log of BRFSS or Gallup respondents’income. We also check and report results when using the
log of MSA-level income per capita as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and averaged
over the relevant period (2005-2010 for the BRFSS regressions and 2008-2011 for the Gallup ones).
Tables 7 and 8 explore what happens when we add MSA-level potential confounders such as crime
rate, the share of African Americans and population (in levels).
We then perform individual level regressions, where we control for individual characteristics
such as education and ethnicity, as well as gender, marital status, and age. Income is not an
innocuous control as the e¤ect of creative destruction is likely to operate precisely through income,
so we show results separately with and without this control.
The speci…cation is as follows:
SW Bi;m;t = CDm;t + Um;t + Xi;t + Tt +

i;t ,

(12)

where SW Bm;t is subjective wellbeing for individual i who lives in MSA m in year t. This measure
is derived either through the life satisfaction question of the BRFSS or through the current ladder
question or the anticipated ladder question in the Gallup survey. CDm;t is creative destruction in
MSA m in year t; which we take to be either the sum of the job creation rate and the job destruction
rate, or these two components introduced separately but simultaneously in the regression. Um;t is
the unemployment rate in that MSA in year t. Xi;t are individual-level controls: gender, age, age
square, race, detailed education, detailed family status and, in some speci…cations, dummies for
income brackets.23 Tt are year and month …xed e¤ects. And

m;t

is the error term. A constant is also

included and standard errors are clustered at the MSA level. The main coe¢ cient of interest is .
We look at how this coe¢ cient changes depending on whether or not we control for unemployment.
We perform several robustness checks which we discuss below. We then look at how the e¤ect of
creative destruction di¤ers according to the sectoral composition of the MSA: some sectors have
stronger or weaker employment prospects, depending on their growth rate or on their tendency to
outsource.

Baseline results
MSA-level results

Table 2 shows the results from the baseline OLS regressions at the MSA level. Panel A of Table
2 is based on the BRFSS dataset and thus the dependent variable is the Life Satisfaction index
23

In both surveys, income is measured by income brackets: monthly individual income in Gallup and annual
household income in Gallup. We use dummies for these brackets.

13

constructed from answers to the question "How satis…ed are you with your life?". Column (1)
shows a negative e¤ect of unemployment on Life Satisfaction. Column (2) shows a non-signi…cant
positive e¤ect of job turnover on Life Satisfaction. Column (3) shows that once we control for
unemployment, job turnover has a positive signi…cant e¤ect on Life Satisfaction. This is in line
with our model which predicts that, controlling for unemployment, turnover should only have
a positive e¤ect on wellbeing as it implies higher growth and a higher probability for currently
unemployed workers of …nding a new job.24 Column (4) decomposes job turnover between job
creation and job destruction. We see the positive e¤ect of job creation and the negative e¤ect
of job destruction, although the latter becomes non-signi…cant once we control for unemployment
(Column (5)).
Panel B of Table 2 reproduces the same exercise but using the Gallup survey and the corresponding Cantril ladder indicator. Remarkably, even though the data set and measure are completely
di¤erent from those in the BRFSS, the results exactly mirror those from the BRFSS, namely: (i)
a negative e¤ect of unemployment on the Cantril ladder in Column (1); (ii) a positive but barely
signi…cant e¤ect of job turnover on the ladder in Column (2); (iii) a signi…cant and more positive
e¤ect of turnover on the ladder once we control for unemployment in Column (3); (iv) a positive
e¤ect of job creation and a negative e¤ect of job destruction in Column (4), the latter being more
than halved once we control for unemployment (Column (5)).
T ABLE 2 HERE
Panel C of Table 2 reproduces the same regression analysis but looking at the e¤ect of job turnover
on the Anticipated ladder (which again uses the Gallup data). By comparing with Panel B, we …rst
see that job turnover has a stronger e¤ect on the Anticipated ladder than on the current Cantril
ladder. Moreover, Column (2) shows that job turnover has a positive and signi…cant e¤ect on the
Anticipated ladder even if we do not control for unemployment. This in turn points to the notion
that individuals disentangle the short-run losses from becoming unemployed as a result of job
turnover from the long-term gains associated with higher growth and more new job opportunities
in the future. This view is con…rmed by looking at Column (4) which shows that the negative
e¤ect of job destruction on the Anticipated ladder is barely signi…cant even if we do not control for
unemployment.
Table 3 looks at the e¤ect of job turnover on the "Worry" measure of wellbeing. We see
that job turnover increases "worry", and that the coe¢ cient becomes smaller when we control for
unemployment. This again is in line with the theory, and suggests that one source of short-run
24
The correlation between the MSA-level average job turnover rates over the period 2005-2010 and the MSA-level
average unemployment rates over the same period, is equal to 0.27.

14

stress from higher turnover is due to the increased probability of becoming unemployed.
T ABLE 3 HERE
Now, consider the magnitudes of the various e¤ects. Consistently across both datasets, the magnitude of the e¤ect of creative destruction on current life satisfaction is in the same ballpark as that
of the e¤ect of the unemployment rate. In particular, moving from an MSA which is at the 25th
percentile in terms of its level of creative destruction (i.e with a job creation rate + destruction rate
at 23.4%) to an MSA at the 75th percentile (i.e with a job creation rate plus job destruction rate
at 28.3%) is associated with an increase in the current ladder of life of 0.067 points (Column (3) in
Table 2, Panel B). As a benchmark, looking at the same regression, moving from the 75th to the
25th percentile in terms of the unemployment rate (that is, from a 9.4% to a 6.7% unemployment
rate) is associated with an increase in life satisfaction of 0.08 points. Another way to put it is that a
one standard deviation increase in job turnover has an e¤ect equivalent to a 0.7 standard deviation
increase in the MSA level unemployment rate.
When focusing on anticipated wellbeing, that is, on Panel C of Table 2, the e¤ect of creative
destruction is slightly stronger than that of the unemployment rate. Indeed, a one standard deviation increase in job turnover has an e¤ect on the future ladder of life equivalent to a 1.3 standard
deviation increase in the MSA-level unemployment rate.
Table 4 shows that the signi…cance and sign of the job turnover coe¢ cient remain when introducing the square and the cube of the unemployment rate as additional controls. Thus the
positive e¤ect of job turnover is not standing proxy for potential non-linearities in the e¤ect of the
unemployment rate.
Tables 5 and 6 add controls for income per capita. Table 5 focuses on the Cantril ladder of life
from Gallup whereas Table 6 uses the BRFSS measure of life satisfaction. In these tables, Panel A
just reproduces the baseline results showed in Table 2. Then Panel B adds our preferred control for
income. In both surveys, income is measured in terms of income brackets. We take the midpoints
of these brackets assuming that income is log-normally distributed and we then average at the
MSA-level these log midpoints. Panel C controls for income in another way: namely, we take the
MSA-level income per capita measure from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, average it over the
relevant years and then take its log. We see that, when the Cantril ladder of life is the dependant
variable (Table 5), not only do both types of control for income yield very similar results but the
coe¢ cient for the job turnover rate remains essentially the same as in the speci…cation without any
control for income. This result is in line with our remark in the theory section about the e¤ect of
turnover on wellbeing going beyond the e¤ect of turnover on income.25
25

The F-test for the joint signi…cance of the job creation and the job destruction rates when we control for the
unemployment rate and average log of income is 13.75.

15

Now if we move to the BRFSS dataset (Table 6), controlling for the BEA income per capita
measure (Panel C) yields a very similar coe¢ cient for the job turnover rate as in the speci…cation
without control for income (Panel A). But, when controlling for the average log income as measured
by the BRFSS (Panel B) job turnover has a signi…cant e¤ect on life satisfaction even when we do
not control for the unemployment rate (column 2). However we still obtain a coe¢ cient for the job
turnover rate which is higher when we control for unemployment (column 3) than when we do not
(column 2).
Tables 7 and 8 add further controls which are meant to capture characteristics of MSAs that
might a priori confound the results which we care about. Thus to the baseline speci…cations of
Tables 2 and 3 we add controls for the average log of income (as measured by the BRFSS or Gallup
surveys), MSAs’population levels coming from the BEA, crime rates from the FBI Crime Statistics
and the share of African Americans in the MSA.26 Comparing Table 7 to Table 2 and Table 8 to
Table 3 provide evidence that, for all subjective wellbeing measures considered, our baseline results
are robust to adding these potential confounders as controls.
Overall, creative destruction has an e¤ect on subjective wellbeing of the opposite sign from that
of unemployment but of similar magnitude when measuring wellbeing by current life satisfaction;
and the e¤ect of creative destruction on subjective wellbeing is of a higher magnitude than that
of unemployment when measuring wellbeing by anticipated life satisfaction (i.e by the Anticipated
ladder).

3.3.2

Individual level results

In Tables 9 to 12, we perform individual-level regressions using the BRFSS and the Gallup data
and …nd qualitatively similar results as in Tables 2 and 3. The di¤erence is that we now also control
for individual-level characteristics and for year and month …xed e¤ects.
T ABLES 9 to 12 HERE
Panels "A" in all Tables 9 to 12, are without individual demographic controls, whereas Panels
"B" in these tables include all controls except income and Panels "C" also control for income. Our
preferred speci…cation in all tables is that of Panels "B", as the model predicts that the indirect
positive e¤ect of job turnover on individual wellbeing goes through a higher net present value of
earnings, and controlling for self-reported income might partially shut down this latter channel.
26

The share of African Americans is a weighted average of the number of respondents in the surveys that report
being black in the race question. Weights use to compute the weighted average are those attached to the respondent
by either Gallup or the BRFSS.

16

The magnitude of the creative destruction e¤ect is roughly similar to that displayed at the MSA
level, although slightly smaller. A one standard deviation increase in job turnover has an e¤ect on
the current ladder of life which is equivalent to half a standard deviation increase in the MSA-level
unemployment rate. And it has an e¤ect on the future ladder of life twice as large as that on the
current ladder.

Robustness analysis
Subperiod analysis

To deal with the concern that the period post 2008 is a period following a major recession, where
all sorts of other things were going on in developed economies, in Table 13 we decompose the overall
BRFSS sample period into the subperiods 2005-2007 and 2008-2010. The Table shows that the
main result, namely that the e¤ect of the turnover rate on wellbeing is unambiguously positive
when we control for unemployment and less so if we do not, remains true in both subperiods.
T ABLE 13 HERE
3.4.2

Alternative database for creative destruction

As an alternative to the creative destruction data from the Census’Business Dynamics Statistics
(BDS), here we use the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) dataset constructed
by the Census bureau. These data are constructed based on the Quarterly Census of Employment
and Wages (QCEW) and other administrative and survey data. They contain information on
employment, earnings, and job ‡ows at the MSA level with a detailed industry breakdown. The
only state that does not participate in this program is Massachusetts (and Puerto Rico). We will
take advantage in the next subsections of the detailed breakdown at the industry level. In terms
of creative destruction: rather than job creations and destructions, the data give us the number
of hires and separations. They give both the raw numbers of all hires and separations that occur
during a given quarter in a given MSA, and the numbers of so-called "stable hires", that is hires
that lasted at least a full quarter, and so-called "separations from stable jobs", that is a separation
from a job that had begun in the previous quarter. To compute the turnover rates, we divide
these hires or separations by the average stock of employment between the previous quarter and
the current one (or the average stock of stable jobs for the "stable job turnover" measure). The
correlation between our proxy for creative destruction in the two di¤erent datasets is around 0.6.
Table 14 shows the robustness of the MSA-level baseline results to using this alternative measure
of creative destruction (with slightly more positive coe¢ cients for stable job turnover).

3.4.3

Panel analysis and predicted creative destruction

Using the quarterly data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) dataset,
we can perform two additional exercises. The …rst exercise is to look at the relationship between
turnover and wellbeing in panel regressions with year, quarter and MSA …xed e¤ects (Table 15,
columns 1, 2 and 3). Whether looking at Panels A or B, i.e. whether considering the turnover rate
for stable jobs or for all jobs, if we compare column 1 to column 2, we see again that the coe¢ cient
for job turnover is higher when we control for the MSA-level unemployment rate than when we do
not. These two columns are without MSA …xed-e¤ects. When we add MSA …xed e¤ects (column
3), the coe¢ cient of job turnover is still signi…cantly positive although of a smaller magnitude and
again this is the case in both Panels A and B.
Second, to abstract from the e¤ects of local changes in industry composition, or from the e¤ects
of purely local shocks that could get mixed up with variations in local turnover, we can construct
a "predicted measure" (or Bartik-type measure) of creative destruction as follows:
X
d m;t =
CD
! j;m;2004 CDj;U SA;t
j

d m;t , is
For each MSA m in quarter-year t, the predicted level of Creative Destruction, CD

computed by taking a weighted average of countrywide turnover measures in sector j, quarter-year
t, CDj;U SA;t , with weights being determined by the sectoral structure in the MSA in 2004, ! j;m;2004
(sectors are 2 digit NAICS).
Thus, in Columns 4, 5, and 6 of Table 15 we reproduce the MSA-level regressions of Columns 1d m;t : Standard errors are
3, but replacing the direct local turnover variable by its predicted value CD
still clustered at the MSA level.27 The results turn out to be quite similar when using the predicted

measure of turnover instead of the actual quarterly turnover rate as right-hand side variable. In
particular, the coe¢ cient for job turnover is larger when we control for unemployment than when we
do not (columns 5 versus 4) and the coe¢ cient remains positive and signi…cant when we add MSA
…xed-e¤ects (column 6). Interestingly the MSA …xed-e¤ects do not make the coe¢ cient decrease
as much as when using the actual turnover rate as the main right-hand side variable.

3.5

Interactions

We …rst interact turnover with MSA-level characteristics, and more precisely with the industry
composition of the MSAs. Namely, we look at whether the e¤ect of job turnover on wellbeing di¤ers
27

If we assume that the sectoral composition in an MSA in 2004 has no direct e¤ect on subjective wellbeing in that
same MSA in 2005-2011, we could use our predicted measure of creative destruction as an instrument to try and get
at whether the e¤ect of creative destruction on subjective well-being is causal.

18

according to whether the dominant sectors of the MSA have lower or stronger growth potential and
have a higher or lower propensity to outsource their activities abroad.
In Table 16 we interact job turnover (or the job creation and job destruction rates separately)
with a dummy for being in an MSA above median in terms of the productivity growth in the
MSA’s industries. The productivity growth measure is constructed as the Bartik variable in the
above subsection: namely, as a weighted average of TFP growth in the di¤erent sectors,
P Gm =

X

wj;m T F P Gj;U SA

j

with weights wj;m corresponding to average sector shares in the MSA’s total employment over
the period 2005-2010. The source for the productivity measure is the NBER-CES Manufacturing
Industry database.28 This database stops in 2009, thus sectoral nationwide productivity growth is
averaged over the period 2005-2009. Table 16 shows that turnover has a more positive e¤ect on
well-being in MSAs where industries are growing faster than the median. Indeed we see that, when
we do not control for unemployment, the job turnover rate has a positive e¤ect on life satisfaction
only in MSAs above median in terms of productivity growth (column 1). When we do control for
unemployment, the e¤ect is signi…cantly positive everywhere but signi…cantly stronger in "above
median" MSAs.
T ABLE 16 HERE
In Table 17 we perform the same exercise except that we look at the extent to which industries
outsource: presumably, the e¤ect of turnover on wellbeing should be less positive in MSAs where the
economic activity is more dominated by industries which outsource more, the idea being that job
destruction is more likely to be irreversible in such MSAs. To proxy the extent to which a sector is
prone to outsourcing, we follow Autor et al (2013) and use the growth of imports from China in that
sector over the period 1991-2007. Sectoral variation is within the 3 digits NAICS manufacturing.
Table 12 con…rms that turnover has a less positive e¤ect on wellbeing in MSAs where industries
are more prone to outsource their activities. Indeed we see that the interaction term between the
job turnover rate and the dummy for being above median in terms of the outsourcing threat, is
signi…cantly negative whether or not we control for unemployment (columns 1 and 2). Moreover,
this is driven by a more negative e¤ect of the job destruction rate in MSAs that are more likely
to outsource: namely, the interaction term between the job creation rate and the dummy for being
above median is not signi…cant whereas the interaction term between the job destruction rate and
the dummy for being above median is signi…cantly negative (columns 3 and 4)
T ABLE 17 HERE
28

We thus restrict attention to manufacturing and consider 3 digits NAICS manufacturing sectors.

19

Finally, we interact turnover with the generosity of unemployment insurance (UI generosity) at
the state level. More speci…cally, in Table 18 we reproduce the baseline MSA-level analysis (Table
2 Panel B) but interacting all creative destruction variables (either the job turnover rate or the
job creation rate and job destruction rates separately) with a dummy for whether the MSA in
located in a state above median in terms of UI generosity, and controlling for the direct e¤ect of
being located in such a state. A state’s UI generosity is measured by the average maximum weekly
bene…t amount over the period 2008-2011. We see that the e¤ect of turnover is only positive for
MSAs located in states above median. Moreover this di¤erence come from the e¤ect of the job
destruction rate: there are no statistically signi…cant di¤erences for the e¤ect of the job creation
rate between MSAs in states above or below median in terms of UI generosity but the e¤ect of the
job destruction rate is negative for MSAs in states below median and positive for MSAs in states
above median when we control for the unemployment rate.
T ABLE 18 HERE
In Table 19 we also replicate the baseline MSA level analysis (Table 2 Panel B) but splitting the
sample of MSAs into those located in states above median in terms of UI generosity and those
located in states below median, and running separate regressions for the two sub-samples. We see
that the e¤ect of job turnover on life satisfaction is signi…cantly positive only for MSAs in states
above median.

Conclusion

In this paper we have analyzed the relationship between turnover-driven growth and subjective
wellbeing, using cross-sectional MSA level US data. We have …rst built a Schumpeterian model
of growth and unemployment to make predictions on how job and …rm turnover a¤ect wellbeing
under various circumstances. Our main empirical …ndings are consistent with the theory: namely:
(i) the e¤ect of creative destruction on wellbeing is unambiguously positive if we control for MSAlevel unemployment, less so if we do not; (ii) creative destruction has a larger positive e¤ect on
future wellbeing than on current wellbeing; (iii) creative destruction has a more positive e¤ect
on wellbeing in MSAs with faster growing industries or with industries that are less prone to
outsourcing; (iv) creative destruction has a more positive e¤ect on wellbeing in MSAs within states
with more generous unemployment insurance policies.
The analysis in this paper can be extended in several directions. A …rst avenue would be to
use a similar combination of the theory and of cross-section analysis to investigate other potential
determinants of wellbeing and compare them with the determinants of (per capita) GDP growth.
20

A second extension would be to look at how the relationship between turnover and wellbeing is affected by individual characteristics29 and by characteristics of labor markets and labor market policy
beyond the generosity of unemployment insurance (e.g. training systems, availability of vocational
education,..). A third extension would be to look for policy shocks (labor market reforms,...) that
may a¤ect the relationship between creative destruction and wellbeing. These and other extensions
of the analysis in this paper are left for future research.

Thus we looked at how the e¤ect of turnover on wellbeing might vary with age: more speci…cally, we replicated
the baseline analysis of Table 2 Panel B but instead of considering the wellbeing of all working age respondents (as
in Table 2 Panel B) we looked separately at the wellbeing of respondents below median in terms of age (see Table 20
Panel A) and above median (see Table 20 Panel B), the median age being 40. We found that the e¤ect of turnover on
life satisfaction is more positive for the younger individuals, which is in turn consistent with our theoretical prediction
that the e¤ect of turnover on wellbeing should be more positive the lower the discount rate.

Transitional dynamics

Now we focus on a sudden change in the entry rate to analyze its impact on the economy’s transition
from one steady state to the next.
Assume that the economy starts at its steady state with entry rate xlow and the entry rate suddenly increases from xlow to xhgh such that xhgh > xlow : We start by focusing on the unemployment
rate …rst. After the change in the entry rate, the ‡ow equation of the unemployment rate becomes
u_ t = (1

ut ) xhgh

mt :

Since ut = vt in every period; we get mt = ut = vt ; therefore
u_ t = xhgh

(1 + xhgh ) ut :

(13)

The solution to this di¤erential equation is simply
ut =

xlow
1 + xlow

xhgh
xhgh
e (1+xhgh )t +
:
1 + xhgh
1 + xhgh

Recall that the growth rate is simply g = m ln : Therefore the aggregate growth rate of this
economy during transition is
gt =

xlow
1 + xlow

xhgh
xhgh
e (1+xhgh )t +
1 + xhgh
1 + xhgh

ln :

Now we turn to the value functions
rEt

E_ t =

Yt + xhgh (Ut

Et ); and rUt

U_ t = bYt + (mt (ut ; vt )=ut )(Et

Ut ):

Note that out of the steady state, it is not possible to solve these value functions further analytically.
However, we can explore them numerically. For that, we need to determine 6 parameters:

; xhgh ;

xlow ; ; ; and b: Since our model is stylized, our goal here is to show you the numerical properties
of the model, rather than trying to provide a detailed calibration exercise. We pick the discount
rate, which also corresponds to the interest rate in the benchmark model, to be

= 5%: We will

set xlow = 6:4% and xhgh = 8:7% such that the steady-state unemployment rates are 6% and 8%;
respectively. We set

= 1:18 in order to obtain an initial steady state growth rate of 1%: The

worker share of output is chosen to be

= 0:9 such that the pro…t share of the …rm is 10%. Finally

we set the unemployment bene…t to be b = 0:3%.
The following …gures illustrate this experiment. Until time 0, the economy is at its initial steady
state and at t = 0; the rate of creative destruction increases from xlow to xhgh : The left …gure shows
23

the evolution of the unemployment rate and the right …gure shows the e¤ect on equilibrium welfare.
For expositional purposes, we plot the welfare after normalizing it by the aggregate output every
period.

After the change, the unemployment rate starts to evolve towards its new level according to
the law of motion in (13) : What we see is that the convergence is quick and the economy assumes
its new steady state value almost after 6 years. The impact on welfare is slightly di¤erent. After
the sudden change, the welfare function features a sudden jump at time 0 and then starts to evolve
towards the new steady state. The big change in welfare occurs at the time of the change in creative
destruction and the remaining portion of the transition has much lower impact on the new level of
welfare.
The following …gures illustrate the change in welfare, i.e.

These results con…rm the steady state results in Proposition 1. The left …gure shows that the
increase in welfare after the increase in entry is higher, the higher is the unemployment bene…t.

Similarly, the increase in welfare is higher, the lower is the discount rate. Hence, the steady state
results of the benchmark model are con…rmed in this simple numerical exercise even when the
transitions are taken into account.

B

Exogenous job destruction

So far, the only source of job destruction, as well as job creation, was new entry. However, in reality,
new entry is not the only source of job destruction. Following Pissarides (1990) we now allow for an
additional -exogenous- source of job destruction rate. To capture this, we assume that each job is
destroyed at the rate : Upon this destruction shock, the worker joins the unemployment pool and
the product line becomes idle. When a new entrant comes into this product line at the rate x; it …rst
posts a vacancy in which case then the same product line moves from being idle to being vacant.
Finally, when a vacant product line …nds a suitable worker, the product line becomes producing.
Similarly, if a new entrant enters into a currently producing line, then the sector becomes directly
vacant, the incumbent worker joins the unemployment pool, and the new entrant searches for a
new suitable worker.
In steady state, there will a constant fraction of product lines that are vacant (of measure v), a
constant fraction of lines that are idle (of measure i) and the remaining fraction will be producing.
We illustrate this economy in the following …gure:
Figure 4. Economy with exogenous job destruction

Vacant lines, v

Idle lines, i

Producing lines, 1-v-i

Next, one can compute the steady state fraction of idle, vacant, and producing lines using the
following ‡ow equations:
(1
(1

v

v) x = m;
i)

= ix:

The left hand side of the …rst equation is the ‡ow of sectors into the vacant stage: it is equal
to the ‡ow of productive sectors which become (directly) vacant, namely (1
25

v

i)x, plus the ‡ow

of idle sectors which become vacant, namely ix:The sum of these two terms is equal to (1

v)x:

The right hand side of the …rst equation is the ‡ow of sectors out of the vacant stage: it is simply
equal to the job matching rate m:
Similarly, the left hand side of the second equation is the ‡ow into the idle stage: it is equal
to the ‡ow of producing sectors which become idle, namely (1

i

v) times the ‡ow probability

of an exogenous job destruction shock in such a sector. The right hand side is equal to the ‡ow
out of the idle stage. It is equal to the number of idle sectors times the ‡ow probability of a new
entry in such a sector, which will make it become vacant: namely, ix.
By de…nition unemployment is equal to all the product lines where there is no production,
u = i + v: Hence the above ‡ow equations can be reexpressed as
(1

v) x = m; and (1

u)

= (u

v) x:

(14)

Moreover, the matching technology is such that
m = u v1

(15)

Substituting (15) into (14) we get
v) x = u v 1

(1

; and (1

u)

= (u

v) x:

(16)

These last two equations give us a system of 2-equations and 2-unknowns. For analytical tractability, assume

= 0:5: Then the equilibrium unemployment rate solves a simple quadratic equation,

yielding the solution:
u=1

Unlike in the model without exogenous job destruction, the relationship between entry and
unemployment, and therefore between growth and unemployment, is no longer automatically
monotonic. Here, jobs are being destroyed both by creative destruction at the rate x and also
by the exogenous shock

: The only source of job creation is job postings that happens though

new entrants. Hence, one would expect that when
be job creation whereas when

is large, then the main role of entry will

is very low, then we are back to the previous model and entry

will mainly create unemployment. This is evident in Figure 5 that plots the unemployment rate
against the entry rate for various values of the exogenous destruction rate
expected, as

2 f0; 0:2; 0:9g : As

! 0; entry (turnover) and unemployment becomes positively correlated: in this case

the job destruction e¤ ect dominates the job creation e¤ect. On the other hand, when

is very

high, then the relationship is negative: in that case the job creation e¤ ect of innovation-led growth
on unemployment dominates the job destruction e¤ect.
Now, moving to the relationship between the innovation-led turnover rate x and well-being W ,
Figure 6 shows that the higher the exogenous job destruction rate , the more positive the e¤ect
of x on W; especially for small initial values of x : this is not surprising, as the lower x is relative
to , the more the job creation e¤ect of increasing x dominates the job destruction e¤ect.

C

Risk aversion

We now consider the case where individuals are risk averse with instantaneous preferences U = ln C;
and compute the steady-state value functions under this assumption. Recall that the individuals
discount the future at the rate : Then the value functions for currently employed and unemployed
individuals satisfy the asset equations:
E

E_ = ln (

U

U_

Y ) + x(U

E)

= ln (bY ) + (m(u; v)=u)(E

U)

Now the value functions take the following form
E =
U

=

x ln ( =b) g
+ + ln Y
1+x+
1
ln ( =b) g
ln (b) +
+ + ln Y :
1+x+
1

ln (

)

and

Using the above expressions for E and U; well-being can be shown to be equal to:
W u(c)=ln c =

1

x
1
ln (b) +
ln (
1+x
1+x

) +

1 g

+ ln Y

This expression shows that for given growth rate well-being is a¤ected more negatively by creative
destruction than in the risk neutrality case: since here the agent is risk averse, more asymmetry
between the returns when employed (

) and when unemployed (b) lowers her well-being by more.
27

The net e¤ect of creative destruction on well-being will ultimately depend upon the size of
the asymmetry and upon the magnitude of the growth e¤ect: in particular, if the unemployment
bene…t is too low relative to the wage rate, or if the growth e¤ect is too small, then the overall
e¤ect of creative destruction on well-being is negative. More precisely:
Proposition 2 When agents are risk averse with U = ln C and the unemployment bene…t is suf…ciently low, namely b <

1=

, then a higher turnover rate x decreases life satisfaction W :
@W u(c)=ln c
< 0:
@x

This proposition states that, when agents are risk averse, job loss is perceived more detrimentally
than when they are risk neutral. Consequently, there is a range of unemployment bene…ts for which
higher turnover reduces life satisfaction for risk averse individuals with log preferences whereas it
would increase life satisfaction for risk-neutral individuals:
ln

1

<b<

1=

Finally, moving continuously from the baseline case where individuals are risk-neutral towards
the risk-averse case where individuals have log preferences, makes the e¤ect of creative destruction
on life satisfaction become increasingly less positive (or increasingly more negative).30

D

Endogeneizing the turnover rate

In this section of the Appendix, we endogeneize the turnover rate x. To this end, we …rst solve for
the value function of posting a vacancy (V ) and a …lled vacancy (P ) that is currently producing.
If the cost of posting a vacancy is cY , which we think as the registration fee that has to be paid to
the government; then we can write the value of a vacancy as
rV

V_ =

Note that a vacancy is …lled at the rate

The value of a …lled vacancy is

where

is the equilibrium life satisfaction when individuals are risk neutral with u(c) = c (see above); the variable " re‡ects
the degree of risk aversion, and we have

28

In steady state we get the following values
P =

Y
g+x

r

(17)

and
V =

r

Y
g+1

r

:

(18)

Now we are ready to introduce free entry. There is a mass of outsiders enter at the ‡ow of
innovation x. Then the free entry condition is simply equates the value of vacancy to 0:
V = 0:

(19)

Then using (18) and (19) we …nd the entry rate as
x=

r + g:

c

This equation is intuitive. The entry rate increases in ‡ow pro…ts and decreases in the cost of
vacancy. Moreover, it increases in the equilibrium growth rate due to capitalization e¤ect (it
indicates that any formed business today will have higher future growth opportunities).
Recall that r =

from the household maximization and g =

x
1+x

ln : Hence equation (19) is

reexpressed as

To ensure the existence of a unique equilibrium, it is su¢ cient to have the following assumption.
Assumption: The discounted sum of future pro…ts is greater than cost of posting vacancy
> c:
Then the entry rate is implicitly determined as
x=

Note: The dependent variables are MSA-level weighted averages of life satisfaction measures, coming either from the BRFSS
(Panel A) or from Gallup (Panel B and C). The weights used to compute the MSA-level averages are the weights attached to
each respondent by either the BRFSS or Gallup. The sample years are 2005-2010 for BRFSS and 2008-2011 for Gallup. The
independent variables are averages across either 2005-2010 (Panel A) or 2008-2011 (Panel B and C) of MSA-level unemployment
rates (column 1, 3 and 5), job turnover rates (column 2 and 3), job creation and job destruction rates (column 4 and 5). The
unemployment rates come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Local Area Unemployment Statistics). The job creation and
job destruction rates come from the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau. The job creation (destruction) rate
is the sum of all employment gains (losses) from expanding establishments from year (t-1) to year t including establishment
startups, divided by the average employment in year t and (t-1). The job turnover rate is defined as the sum of the job creation
rate and the job destruction rate. There is no additional control besides the coefficient displayed.

Note: Everything is similar to Tables 2 and 3, except that the unemployment rate is introduced in the regressions along with
its square and its cube.
The dependent variables are MSA-level weighted averages of subjective wellbeing measures, coming either from BRFSS (Panel
A) or from Gallup (Panel B, C and D). The weights used to compute the MSA-level averages are the weights attached to
each respondent by either BRFSS or Gallup. The sample years are 2005-2010 for BRFSS and 2008-2011 for Gallup. The main
independent variables are averages across either 2005-2010 (Panel A) or 2008-2011 (Panel B, C and D) of MSA-level job turnover
rates (column 1 and 2), and of job creation and job destruction rates (column 3 and 4). In column 2 and 4, we control for a
cubic polynomial of 2005-2010 or 2008-2011 averages of MSA-level unemployment rates. The unemployment rates come from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Local Area Unemployment Statistics). The job creation and job destruction rates come from
the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau. The job creation (destruction) rate is the sum of all employment
gains (losses) from expanding establishments from year (t-1) to year t including establishment startups, divided by the average
employment in year t and (t-1). The job turnover rate is defined as the sum of the job creation rate and the job destruction
rate. There is no additional control besides the variables mentioned in the tables.

Note: Panel A shows the benchmark results of table 2 Panel B, where the dependent variable is MSA-level weighted average
of the current ladder of life measure from Gallup. Panel B and C each add a control for income but a di↵erent one. Panel B
uses MSA-level averages of the log of income of each Gallup respondent, where income is defined as the midpoint of individual
monthly income brackets assuming a log-normal distribution. Panel C uses the log of the average MSA-level income per capita
over the period 2008-2011 as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analaysis.
Besides income, as in table 2, the independent variables are averages across the years 2008-2011 of MSA-level unemployment
rates (column 1, 3 and 5), job turnover rates (column 2 and 3), job creation and job destruction rates (column 4 and 5). The
unemployment rates come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Local Area Unemployment Statistics). The job creation and
job destruction rates come from the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau. The job creation (destruction) rate
is the sum of all employment gains (losses) from expanding establishments from year (t-1) to year t including establishment
startups, divided by the average employment in year t and (t-1). The job turnover rate is defined as the sum of the job creation
rate and the job destruction rate. There is no additional control besides the coefficient displayed.

Note: Everything is similar to table 2, except that we now include controls for: average log of income, population (in levels),
crime rates and share of African-Americans.
Log of income is the MSA-level weighted average of the log of income of each BRFSS/Gallup respondent, where income is
defined as the midpoint of income brackets assuming a log-normal distribution (monthly individual income for Gallup and
annual household income for BRFSS). The share of African Americans is a weighted average of the number of respondents
in the surveys that report being black in the race question. Weights use to compute MSA-level weighted averages are those
attached to the respondent by BRFFS/Gallup. Population levels comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Crime rates
come from the FBI Crime statistics.
As in table 2, the dependent variables are MSA-level weighted averages of life satisfaction measures, coming either from the
BRFSS (Panel A) or from Gallup (Panel B and C). Weights used to compute the MSA-level averages are the weights attached
to each respondent by either BRFSS or Gallup. The sample years are 2005-2010 for BRFSS and 2008-2011 for Gallup. The
main independent variables are averages across either 2005-2010 (Panel A) or 2008-2011 (Panel B, C and D) of MSA-level
unemployment rates (column 2 and 4), job turnover rates (column 1 and 2), job creation and job destruction rates (column
3 and 4). The unemployment rates come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Local Area Unemployment Statistics). The
job creation and job destruction rates come from the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau. The job creation
(destruction) rate is the sum of all employment gains (losses) from expanding establishments from year (t-1) to year t including
establishment startups, divided by the average employment in year t and (t-1). The job turnover rate is defined as the sum of
the job creation rate and the job destruction rate. There is no additional control besides the variables mentioned in the tables.

Note: The dependent variable is the BRFSS life satisfaction measure over the periode 2005-2010. Column (1) regresses it on
the unemployment rate of the MSA the respondent lives in. Column (2) regresses it on the job turnover rate of the MSA the
respondent lives in. Column (3) regresses it on both the unemployment and job turnover rates. Column (4) and (5) regress
it on the MSA’s job creation and job destruction rates introduced separately, respectively without and with a control for the
MSA’s unemployment rate. Standard errors are clustered at the MSA level. Year and month fixed e↵ects are included in each
regression. Panel A does not include any individual-level controls. Panel B includes basic demographic controls: age, age
square, a dummy for being female, 7 dummies for family satus , 7 dummies for education, and race dummies (black, asian,
white, other or missing). Panel C adds 8 dummies for annual household income brackets. All regressions are weighted by
individual weights attached by the BRFSS to each respondent.

Note: The dependent variable is the Cantril ladder of life from Gallup over the periode 2008-2011. Column (1) regresses it on
the unemployment rate of the MSA the respondent lives in. Column (2) regresses it on the job turnover rate of the MSA the
respondent lives in. Column (3) regresses it on both the unemployment and job turnover rates. Column (4) and (5) regress
it on the MSA’s job creation and job destruction rates introduced separately, respectively without and with a control for the
MSA’s unemployment rate. Standard errors are clustered at the MSA level. Year and month fixed e↵ects are included in each
regression. Panel A does not include any individual-level controls. Panel B includes basic demographic controls: age, age
square, a dummy for being female, 6 dummies for marital status, 6 dummies for education and race dummies (black, asian,
white). Panel C adds 9 dummies for individual monthly income brackets. All regressions are weighted by individual weights
attached by Gallup to each respondent.

Note: The dependent variables are MSA-level weighted averages of the life satisfaction measure from the BRFSS. The weights
used to compute the MSA-level averages are the weights attached to each respondent in the BRFSS. The sample years are
2005-2007 in Panel A and 2008-2010 in Panel B. The independent variables are averages across either 2005-2007 (Panel A) or
2008-2010 (Panel B) of MSA-level unemployment rates (column 1, 3 and 5), job turnover rates (column 2 and 3), job creation
and job destruction rates (column 4 and 5). The unemployment rates come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Local Area
Unemployment Statistics). The job creation and job destruction rates come from the Business Dynamics Statistics from the
Census Bureau. The job creation (destruction) rate is the sum of all employment gains (losses) from expanding establishments
from year (t-1) to year t including establishment startups, divided by the average employment in year t and (t-1). The job
turnover rate is defined as the sum of the job creation rate and the job destruction rate. There is no additional control besides
the coefficient displayed.

Note: The dependent variables are MSA-level weighted averages of life satisfaction measures, coming either from the BRFSS
(Panel A) or from Gallup (Panel B). The weights used to compute the MSA-level averages are the weights attached to each
respondent by either the BRFSS or Gallup. The sample years are 2005-2010 for BRFSS and 2008-2011 for Gallup. The
independent variables are averages across either 2005-2010 (Panel A) or 2008-2011 (Panel B) of MSA-level unemployment
rates (column 1, 3 and 5), and job turnover rates (column 2, 3, 4 and 5). The unemployment rates come from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics (Local Area Unemployment Statistics). The job turnover rates come from the Longitudinal Employer
Household Dynamics Data. Job turnover is defined as the sum of the job creation rate and the job destruction rate. The job
creation (destruction) rate is the number of workers who started a new job (lost a job) during quarter t, divided by the average
employment in that quarter (defined as the sum of employment on the first day and employment on the last day divided by 2).
The job turnover for stable jobs is defined similarly exept that only jobs that lasted more than one quarter are counted. There
is no additional control besides the coefficient displayed.

Note: The dependent variable is quarterly MSA-level averages of the current Cantril ladder in Gallup. Column (1) to (3) use
the actual quarterly job turnover rate from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics. Column (4) to (6) use a predicted
measure of the job turnover rate. Panel B shows the results when we use only jobs that lasted more than a quarter to compute
the job creation and destruction rates (and thus the job turnover rate), whereas Panel A shows the results when we use all jobs
to compute the job creation and destruction rates. The predicted variable is defined as follows: we take quarterly job turnover
rates by sector at the national level from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics, and for each MSA we compute a
weighted average of these national sectoral rates where weights correspond to the share of the MSA’s total employment that the
sector represents in 2004. The sectoral composition of employment by MSA used for the weights comes from the Longitudinal
Employer Household Dynamics.
All regressions include year and quarter fixed e↵ects. Column (3) and (6) add MSA fixed e↵ects.Column (1) and (4) are without
controling for the annual MSA unemployment rate. Standard errors are clustered at the MSA-level.

Note: The dependent variable is the BRFSS measure of life satisfaction over the periode 2005-2010. The independent variables
are measures of creative destruction from the Business Dynamics Statistics (either the job creation rate and the job destuction
rate or the sum of the two), a measure of whether predominant sectors in the MSA experience more or less productivity growth
and interaction terms between the creative destruction variables and the productivity growth measure. The productivity growth
measure of an MSA is computed as follows: we take the 5 factors TFP annual growth by sector at the national level from the
NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (which is only available until 2009 so we use an average over 2005-2009), and for
each MSA we compute a weighted average of these national sectoral rates where weights correspond to the share of the MSA’s
total employment that the sector represents (on average over the period 2005-2009). The sectoral composition of employment
by MSA used for the weights comes from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics. Column (1) and (2) use the job
turnover rate (the sum of the job creation and the job destruction rate) whereas column (3) and (4) introduce the job creation
and the job destruction rate separately. Column(2) and (4) control for the MSA’s unemployment rate whereas column(1) and
(3) do not. Standard errors are clustered at the MSA level. Year and month fixed e↵ects are introduced in all regressions as well
as individual controls:age, age square, a dummy for being female, a dummy for being married or having a partner, a dummy
for having some college or more and race dummies (black, asian, hispanic).

Note: The depdendent variable is the BRFSS measure of life satisfaction over the periode 2005-2010. The independent
variables are measures of creative destruction from the Business Dynamics Statistics (either the job creation rate and the job
destruction rate or the sum of the two), a measure of whether predominant sectors in the MSA are more or less prone to
outsource their activity and interaction terms between the creative destruction variables and the measure of the outsourcing
threat. The outsourcing threat measure of an MSA is computed as follows: following Autor et al. (AER, 2013), we take the
growth of imports from China by sectors, and for each MSA we compute a weighted average of these national sectoral import
growth rates where weights correspond to the share of the MSA’s total employment that the sector represents (we average
these shares over the whole period 2005-2010). The sectoral composition of employment by MSA used for the weights comes
from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics. Column (1) and (2) use the job turnover rate (the sum of the job
creation and the job destruction rate) whereas column (3) and (4) introduce the job creation and the job destruction rate
separately. Column(2) and (4) control for the MSA’s unemployment rate whereas column(1) and (3) do not. Standard errors
are clustered at the MSA level. Year and Month fixed e↵ects are introduced in all regressions as well as individual controls:
age, age square, a dummy for being female, a dummy for being married or having a partner, a dummy for having some college
or more and race dummies (black, asian, hispanic).

destruction rates (column 3 and 4) and unemployment rates (column 2 and 4), interacted with whether the MSA is located
in a state above median in terms of UI generosity, controlling for the direct e↵ect of being located in such an above median
state. A state’s UI generosity is measured by the average maximum weekly benefit amount over the period 2008-2011. The
unemployment rates come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Local Area Unemployment Statistics). The job creation and
job destruction rates come from the Business Dynamics Statistics from the Census Bureau. The job creation (destruction) rate
is the sum of all employment gains (losses) from expanding establishments from year (t-1) to year t including establishment
startups, divided by the average employment in year t and (t-1). The job turnover rate is defined as the sum of the job creation
rate and the job destruction rate. There is no additional control besides the coefficient displayed.

Note: The dependent variable is MSA-level weighted averages of answers to the current ladder of life question. The weights used
to compute the MSA-level averages are the weights attached to each respondent by Gallup. The sample years are 2008-2011.
The independent variables are 2008-2011 averages of MSA-level job turnover rates (column 1 and 2), job creation and job

Note: The dependent variable is MSA-level weighted averages of answers to the current ladder of life question. The weights
used to compute the MSA-level averages are the weights attached to each respondent by Gallup. The sample years are
2008-2011. Panel A restricts attention to MSAs located in states above median in terms of UI generosity whereas Panel B
focuses on MSAs in states below median. A state’s UI generosity is measured by the average maximum weekly benefit amount

Su¢ cient Condition for Exit in Section 2.1.2.

Denote the value of an incumbent before entry by V1 and after entry V2 : Then we can express these
value functions as
rV1

V_ 1 = Y + x (V2

V2 ) :

Since in equilibrium m = v; we get
V2 =
