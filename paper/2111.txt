Given the nature and magnitude of the role played by Japan in

causing the bilateral trade imbalance, the next question the paper
addresses is how Japan might best act to alleviate this imbalance.
This section of the paper examines fiscal, monetary and other policy

initiatives Japan might take to reduce the trade imbalance.

The

evidence stresses the desirability of expanding Japan's services

Introduction

In recent months there has been considerable debate over
how to cut the U.S. trade deficit. Perhaps because a deficit is
viewed as something "bad" and a surplus as something "good", much

attention has been focused on what the U.S. might do to improve

the situation.

There is some sense to this.

After all, if a

surplus really is desirable, countries like Japan which enjoy a
substantial surplus can hardly be expected to take the initiative
in altering the status quo.

Yet, it is dangerous to focus on potential U.S. actions
while relegating Japan's response to the background.

The trade

imbalance is in fact a problem for Japan as well as the U.S. air

countries have grown so economically interdependent that trade
problems in the U.S. can have disastrous consequences for Japan
and vice—versa.

It is imperative to understand the Japanese perspective on

how the trade imbalance emerged, and Japan's likely role in
resolving this imbalance.
address here.

These are the issues we wish to

More specifically,

we examine and discuss

objective features of Japan's economy and economic policies which

have contributed to the trade imbalance, and evaluate Japan's
subjective assessment of its responsibility for this problem. We
then discuss what Japan's likely response to the trade imbalance

issue will be,

and the implications for Japan—U.S. trade

imbalances and trade friction.

Factors such as Japan's high savings rate and weak domestic

demand have served to promote a Japanese trade surplus vis—a—vis the
U.S.

The high rate of saving and weak domestic demand reflect in

part the high cost of housing and education relative to income.

demand reflect structural factors like housing and education costs,

factors are also important.

Paltry increases in real

earnings have kept consumption in check. As Table 2 indicates, real
cash earnings in Japan rarely increased by more than two percent per

annum over 1979—1985, in spite of annual productivity gains which

rarely increased by less than two percent

(and which usually

increased by substantially more). Other structural features, such as

Japan's longer working hours, have also served to strengthen
savings and dampen demand.

Private consumption

has become an increasingly important

component of domestic demand in Japan over the past 15 years.

For instance, while buriness investment accounted for 21% of

in 1970, it now accounts for only 16% .

While

spending increased substantially after the first

oil shock, its share of domestic demand today is roughly the same

as it was in 1970, around 17%. For this reason, sluggish private
consumption is of particular concern today.

Macroeconomic Policy

Japan's macroeconomic policies have tended to reinforce the

effects of its macroeconomic structure on the trade imbalance.
Where

expansionary fiscal policy might have

significantly

increased domestic demand, redressing the need to expand exports,

Japan has instead pursued a course of fiscal restraint over the
past several years.

Given current Japanese sentiment, it may be

difficult to implement expansionary fiscal policy.

In the

business conmiunity, fiscal expansion is viewed as an avenue of
last resort.

For example, Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Japan

Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), has emphasized
that

government should explore other possibilities

before

resorting to expansionary fiscal policy via a construction bond
issue:

Some people argue that construction bonds to finance
social infrastructure building are different from
deficit—covering bonds, but in reality they share the
same effect of leaving debts to future generations.4

Given Japan's low interest rates, it is unlikely that
monetary policy could play a strong expansionary role.

Japan's industrial structure today is the outcome of a
concerted effort to become more energy—efficient in response to

the oil shocks of the 1970s.

Besides increasing productive

efficiency, Japanese industries have successfully advanced into
those fields having a high income elasticity of demand.

indicates that the income elasticity of Japan's exports exceeds
that of most. other major industrialized countries, particularly

By contrast, the income elasticity of Japan's imcorts are

also indicates.

The relatively low income elasticity of' Japan's

imports can be explained in part by Japan's import structure,
which includes a high share of' raw materials and fuels.

Income

elasticities are fairly low for these kinds of imports.

Industrial Policy

Just as Japan's macroeconomic policies have cocnplemented

structural features of its macroeconomy, Japan's industrial
policies have complemented its industrial structure. In response

to the havock wrought by the first oil crisis,

Japanese

industrial policy sought to promote R & D investment in high

Thus, the character of

Trade Barriers

In terms of actual tariffs and quotas, it is difficult to
argue that Japanese protectionism has meaningfully contributed to

its trade surplus. The supporting evidence simply is not there.
Table 5 indicates, for example, that nominal tariff rates are low
in Japan relative to other major industrialized nations.

Given the difficulties in

it is unlikely that this

Nor do there appear to have been substantial recent changes in

non—tariff barriers which might have caused a large trade
imbalance.

Capital Mobility and Japan's Capital Markets

For the past several years, the United States has been
clamoring for increased liberalization of Japan's capital markets
and increased capital mobility.

This pressure culminated in the

so—called Yen/Dollar Agreement reached at the sumit meeting in
Tokyo in November, 1983.
The

intent of this agreement was to eliminate

yen

depreciation allegedly caused by a combination of artificially
low interest rates in Japan and restrictions on capital flows ——

restrictions

which were particularly discouraging to capital

inflow into Japan.

The actual importance of these factors for the yen/dollar
exchange rate and, ultimately, the Japan—U.S. trade imbalance, is

a matter of considerable dispute.

Some have argued that in the

past Japan has deliberately tried to depreciate the yen by
keeping domestic interest rates artificially low.

At first

blush, there seems to be some evidence to support this claim. As

Table 6 indicates, interest rates tended to be substantially
lower in Japan than in the U.S. Furthermore, while interest rates

for long—term government bonds declined in both Japan and the
U.S. over 1982—1985, the spread actually increased.

does this pattern appear likely to change any time soon.

This is particularly unfortunate since capital market liberalization
may

be

the most significant measure Japan can take, not only in

terms of appreciating the yen, but in the interest of greater equity
and efficiency:

.domestic liberalization (of capital markets) might be
considered the most likely (measure) to have a significant
upward effect on the yen, and to have beneficial

implications for the efficient and equitable working of
the Japanese economy.
But domestic liberalization is
already taking place at a deliberate pace and is the
category of policy measures least susceptible to being
speeded up in response to U.S. pressure. 7

In terms of actual exchange rate outcomes, however, the
case against Japan is much weaker.

Frankel demonstrates that,

when currency values are measured in terms of a weighted average
among

trading

partners, the effective exchange values of European

currencies decreased over l980_l9814, but the effective exchange
value of the yen actually increased. Frankel concludes from this
that:

12

.the Drimary problem is with the strong appreciation of
dollar and the roots of that appreciation within
U.S. economic policy, not with yen appreciation or Japanese
the

ecenonc policy.8

Fvrn ii Frankel's conclusion n true, it does not follow
that Japanese policy towards its domestic capital markets poses
no significant problems for the Japan-JJ.S. trade imbalance and

trade friction. First, the economic problem remains. While the
effective exchange value of the yen appreciated over l980_198L1,

the questions is, would this measure of the yen's value have
appreciated even more if Japan had fully liberalized domestic
capital markets?
questior,

but

There is no quantitative answer to this
as

Frankel himself

has

noted,

domestic

liberalization is perhaps the most significant capital market
action Japan can take

to

appreciate the yen.

Second, the political problem remains.

Regardless of the

objective effect of domestic liberalization on exchange rates,
Japan's failure to fully liberalize domestic capital markets is
perceived as a malicious effort to depreciate the yen. Hence, it

serves as a convenient scapegoat for her trading partners when
they find themselves running a trade deficit with Japan.

Furthermore, while Japan has taken greater strides in
promoting capital mobility, such measures, unaccompanied by
meaningful domestic liberalization, have served to promote a
capital outflow bias. As long as this situation persists, Japan's
capital market policy will remain a festering sore to her trading
partners.

Now if Japan's industrial structure (which largely produces

machinery and equipment) were significantly responsible for the
Japan—U.S. trade imbalance, we might expect to observe a similar

pattern between Japan and other countries which import a large
share of manufactured goods from Japan. No such pattern emerges,
however.

For example, although at least 50% of Japan's exports

to China, Korea and Australia are in manufactured goods, these
countries have only modest trade imbalances with Japan; indeed,
Australia enjoys a modest trade surplus vis—a—vis Japan.

III. Japan's Perceived Responsibility for the
Trade Imbalance

Given

the structural features arid policy measures in Japan

which have contributed to the trade imbalance, the next question

15

we as< is: to what extent do the Japanese view themselves as

responsible for this imbalance?

To answer such a question

requires an understanding of both traditional Japanese values and

more

recent adaptations in response to changing

economic

realities.

Why Japan Does Not Feel Culpable

Traditionally, Japan has been a hardworking, team—oriented

society. The Japanese work longer hours than do
other major industrialized countries.
Japanese

workers in

Table 9 indicates that

labor works substantially more hours than

their

counterparts in the U.S., the U.K., France and West Germany. If
anything, this gap appears to be increasing over time.

a

nation

rrti2ul2rly reluctant t:' accept the blame when trade imbalances
arise.

This reluctance is exacerbated when the cplaining

trading partn'viz., t'n U.S.) enjoys a higher standard of
living (especially if leisure and housing are included) with
apparently less sacrifice.

A predilection for cooperation and individual sacrifice

makes Japan less likely to feel responsible for the trade
imbalance for two reasons. First and more obviously, Japan tends
to view its economic achievements as a direct result of sweat and

sacrifice. As such, Japan takes a dim view of' pressure by other
nations to relinquish what it regards as its "just desserts."

Second, the team—oriented nature of Japanese society makes

it difficult to point an accusing finger at any one segment of

the society.

In the U.S., perhaps the antithesis of a team—

oriented society, there is no shortage of accusing fingers.
Consumers point to ill—advised U.S. macroeconomic policy as
contributing to the trade imbalance while government is quick to

cite spendthrift consumers as the main culprits. In a team—
oriented society, however, it is more difficult to point an
accusing finger at the poor performance of one or two members of
that team. To function smoothly, a team must collectively accept

blame or collectively reject blame. While Japan may privately

acknowledge that some of its sectors have contributed

to

increasing the trade imbalance, collectively, Japan does not feel
significantly responsible for it. "Team Japan" does not feel that
it has commited any foul play.

17

In addition to traditional and cultural factors, adaptations

in Japan's attitudes and philosophies have helped promote its

industrial restructuring following the first and second oil
crises.

Thurow's

The most important adaptation was inspired by Professor
9

"Zero—Sum Society" doctrine .

According to this

doctrine, if one economic entity gains, the other must inevitably
lose.

Published in 1980, Professor Thurow's ideas were enormously
popular

in Japan,

especially among the Japanese business

community. The appeal that such a doctrine held for the Japanese

during this time is not surprising.

In response to the oil

crises of the 1970s, greater energy efficiency in production and

increased exports to pay for the high cost of oil imports were
objectives of top priority in Japan.

While these goals held

great promise for Japan, it was apparent that they could lead to
trade deficits and/or loss of international competitiveness for

Japan's trading partners, most notably the U.S.

The Zero—Sum

philosophy argued that such outcomes, while perhaps unfortunate,

were inevitable.

Now if a Zero—Sum world were as inevitable as
'I

the most hard—boiled laws in economics, then such a rationale for

Japan's industrial restructuring efforts would seem even better

than appealing to cultural and traditional factors unique to
Japan.

fundamental sources of the Pxnerican current

and a correction of the (trade) deficit depends on

itself, must be very clear to people who understand just
a little economics.1O

To many Japanese, U.S. accusations of Japan's responsibility
19

in the trade imbalance is little more than the irrational ravings
of a bested competitor:

When a country falls into a difficulty, the domestic
reaction is often to emphasize that it is caused by
unreasonable and unfair actions of foreign countries.

Criticism of Japan is partly to be understood in this
context, and is thus not something which will drift away
of its own

accord.11

To be sure, the official stance of the Japanese government

on Japan's role in the trade imbalance is considerably more
diplomatic.

On numerous occasions, Prime Minister Nakasone has

declared that Japan should promote international harmony by
cooperating to reduce the trade imbalance.

The official government position almost certainly results

from Japan's concern over potential U.S. protectionism, not
because Japan feels responsible for the trade imbalance.

One

need not look too far beneath the surface before evidence of'
Japan's resentment and concern over U.S. protectionist measures

to redress the trade imbalance clearly emerges.

For example,

Such a conclusion, however, is inaccurate. It is inaccurate for
the simple reason that Japan has too much to lose by failing to
cooperate with the U.S.

Strong protectionist measures by the

U.S. would be disastrous for the Japanese economy, and Japan
would much sooner cooperate, albeit grudgingly, than deal with
U.S. protectionism. There are a variety of measures Japan might

take to alleviate the trade imbalance, and we turn now

to an

examination of these possibilities.
Exchange Rate Realignment
Exchange rate realignment has already taken place on a
grand scale, with the yen appreciating from a low of
2140 U$ in September, 1985

to

21

about 160

L'$ by

July, 1986.

Altriouh the conventional wisdom holds that yen appreciation
alone will not resolve the U.S.—Japan trade imbalance, the U.S.

must recognize that the yen appreciation which has already

occurred has had a substantial and negative impact on the
Japanese economy.

Estimates indicate that Japan's export—

oriented industries will sustain a 30% drop in profits in fiscal
15

year 1986.

Indeed, yen appreciation has already made itself felt at the
macroeconomic level.

Japan's seasonally—adjusted GNP dropped by

0.5 percent in real terms in the first quarter of 1986. This was
the first such drop in Japan's GNP since 1975.

In light of the

adverse effects of yen appreciation, Japan is most reluctant to
allow the yen to appreciate further, and in fact has taken active
16

steps to prevent a further rise in the yen.

That yen

appreciation appears to have had little effect over the short run
17

in reducing the trade imbalance

will probably not induce Japan

to embark on further efforts to strengthen the yen.

Exchange

rates are about as realigned as they are going to get.

Domestic Demand Expansion

This is the most potent and controversial measure Japan can
take to alleviate the trade imbalance.

In spite of its great

promise, domestic demand expansion will proceed more slowly than
did exchange rate realignment. Japan is concerned about possible

adverse effects of' fiscal stimulus, and is likely to implement

substantial

fiscal stimulus only if U.S. pressure to do so

increases.

Japan's reluctance to implement domestic demand expansion

23

Finally, concern that

fiscal stimulus will be ineffective in reducing the trade
imbalance simply because it may

fail to increase imports

conveniently ignores other potentially beneficial effects of
fiscal

stimulus,

such as increasing domestic demand

for

manufactured goods which are typically exported, or increasing
the demand for services.

Generally speaking, there is some agreement as to the value
of domestic demand expansion in a broad, abstract sense.

There

are considerable differences, however, as to how such stimulus
might best be implemented. Given Japan's high saving rate (which

is largely due to high personal saving) and low personal
consumption, an ideal policy would be one directly aimed at
reducing saving and increasing personal consumption.

Government

could help achieve this goal by removing the tax exempt status of'

personal saving and by reforming tax and finance policies to
promote housing investment and demand.

Furthermore, there can be little doubt that shorter working
hours

would significantly expand demand in

This is so because (1) Japanese work much longer

hours than do their counterparts in other industrialized nations

(see Table 9) and (2) while many Japanese have already acquired
manufactured goods, there seems to be strong pent—up demand for
servies.

Figure 3 shows the dramatic rise in Japan's consumption of'
durable goods in the past fifteen to tenty years.

all households in Japan own washing machines, vacuum cleaners and

It will not be easy to translate potential

demand for

services into actual demand, however. 1ajor Japanese firms and
their subcontractors have already suffered from yen appreciation,

and they are hardly likely to respond to this setback by asking
their employees to work shorter hours. Another unhappy result of

Japan's sluggish industrial sector is that wage hikes will

which will also adversely effect

demand

Additionally, substantial increases in the demand

for services will require a shift in industrial structure from
manufacturing industries to service industries.

Some industries

will surely suffer from such restructuring, and they will
naturally resist.

From a society—wide perspective,

increased demand for

services and a corresponding industrial restructuring would be
desirable, for it would improve the quality of life and induce

structural changes which would make Japan less dependent on
exports

for

economic growth. Furthermore, since services tend to

industry restructured to accomodate it, domestic demand for
services could provide a boost to the Japanese economy for a long

period of time.

In the absence of strong governmental actions,

such as regulations on length of the week and incentives for

expansion in the services industries, however, this type of
domestic demand expansion will probably not occur.
26

Sc far,

policmkers have shown little inclination to provide a strong
stiv1s to domestic demand for services.
Domestic demand stimulants, such as a shorter work week and

elimjnatjon of tax exempt status from personal savings, could
also increase the demand for manufactured goods. This would help
divert some Japanese exports to domestic markets.

Furthermore,

those government initiatives specifically aimed at

increasing

domestic demand for manufactured goods (as opposed to services)

may be more politically feasible to implement, since industrial

restructuring requirements to meet higher domestic demand for
manufactured goods would probably be lower. Unfortunately, Japan

does not appear inclined to take the initiative in expanding
demand by these means, either.

Another way to expand domestic demand is by increasing
public expenditures.

effects of this type of expansion on Japan's

trade surplus are less clear.

Will an increase in public

spending to improve Japan's infrastructure increase Japan's
imports? Possibly, but probably not enough to significantly
affect the Japan—U.S. trade imbalance.

While Japan imports a

substantial amount of the raw materials needed for construction

from the U.S. (see Table 7), this figure pales in comparison to
Japan's exports to the U.S. (see Table 8). It is equally unclear
that

increased

expenditures on public

construction

will

appreciably divert Japanese exports to the U.S.—Japan exports
manufactured goods to the U.S., not lumber and cement.
friother drawback to this type of demand stimulus is that it

can only last over a short to midterm horizon.

Government can

only incur so much debt before the public will call for
austerity.

Precisely because the effects of this type of

domestic demand stimulus are only temporary, it is not likely to
induce an appreciable change in Japan's industrial structure away

t. best. th can be

Alternative Possibilities

Aside from exchange rate realignment and domestic demand
stimulus,

there is

the possibility of improving the bilateral

deficit between Japan and the U.S. by diverting some
Japarese exports to developing countries rather than to the U.S.
tade

market. The import capa :ity of these

enhanced by directing the Japanese saving surplus to finance

the deficits of developing countries.

Such a proposal was made

in a report by a study group of the World Institute for
214

Development

Economics Research (WIDER), in April, 1986.

While creative and

novel, this appears nonetheless to be a

plan whose time has not yet come.
developing

When the economies of

nations are sufficiently mature to

provide markets and

investment opportunities that are reasonable substitutes for
those available in the U.S., then one can meaningfully speak of

resolving U.S.—Japan trade imbalances by diverting

Japan's

exports and capital outflow to places other than the U.S.

For the next several years at least, it is most unlikely
that developing countries will be able to absorb Japanese exports

on a scale large enough to significantly reduce the Japan—U.S.
trade

imbalance. Looking back at Table 8,

29

we see that the value

oi Japan's cxporL to th U.S. are more than twice
Japan's

the

value of

exports to its next four largest markets combined. It is

also unclear why

capital

should suddenly flow from Japan to

developing countries when the current flow from Japan to the U.S.
indicates that better investment opportunities exist in the U.S.

Speaking of capital outflows,

another alternative for

reducing the U.S.—Japan trade imbalance is simply to restrict
capital outflows from Japan. To the extent that such outflows
tend to depreciate the yen, their elimination should decrease the

U.S. trade deficit.

This solution, however, is at odds with

long—standing U.S. efforts to deregulate and liberalize Japan's

capital markets.

It could also lead to substantially higher

interest rates in the U.S., and even a recession.

This policy

would be so negatively received in the U.S. that it is

most

unlikely to be implemented. Even if this were not the case, Japan

appears unwilling to undertake actions which might further
appreciate the yen, as noted above.

Exchange rate real igninent and domestic demand stimulus
emerge as the two options Japan may resort to in redressing the

trade imbalance. Since exchange rate realignment has apparently
been implemented to the extent feasible, however, fiscal stimulus
to expand Japan's domestic demand looms as the lone viable option
for Japan to help further reduce the trade imbalance.

There is every reason to believe that such a policy can
succeed. That Japan must depend on exports for growth is a myth.
As Table ii indicates, only over 1980—19814 did exports account
for a substantial proportion of Japan's overall growth in real
GNP.

There is no reason why

the

the future.

Despite its seeming promise, strong fiscal stimulus remains

an option

that

Japan will resort to only if sufficiently

pressured by the US. Whether such U.S. pressure arises depends,

in turn, on the success of U.S. policy initiatives like Gramm—
Rudman in reducing government spending and, ultimately, the trade
imbalance.

Conclusion: Implications for the Trade Imbalance and
Trade Friction

This will be accomplished, one way or another.

The most

benign scenario would be that the policy initiatives of Gramm—Rudman

are spectacularly successful in reducing the U.S. trade deficit, so
that the trade imbalance is resolved without further

U.S. pressure

on Japan.

On the other hand,

if' Gramm—Rudman fails to significantly

reduce the trade imbalance, protectionist sentiment will flare up

in the U.S.

Even when Gramm—Rudman was in its early stages of

promise, Congress demonstrated its willingness to consider strong

protectionist legislature when the House of Representatives
passed a bill calling for a variety of protectionist measures
including some new definitions of unfair trade practices.

One

can only conclude that protectionist sentiments will be much

stronger should Granrn—Rudman fail.

If'

Graum—Rudman fails, Japan will

respond to mounting U.S.

by playing its last card—substantial fiscal stimulus.

Most likely, this stimulus will first come in the form of greater
efforts to expand public works.

Tax cuts, removal of the tax exempt status of personal
saving and the like may follow if' the public works expansion

fails to abate mounting U.S. protectionist sentiment.

Under

either scenario, the trade imbalance will be substantially
reduced.

More ominous, however, are the implications for trade
friction.

It is probably true that, other things remaining the

same, a decline in a trade imbalance results in a decline in
trade friction.

But, in reducing the large trade imbalance

between Japan and the U.S., "other things", such as mutual trust

and respect and a sense of international economic cooperation,
may fall by the wayside. It is even conceivable that, in reducing

the trade imbalance, Japan and the U.S. will intensify their
trade friction.

Many of the factors which could induce this unhappy result
are already present. On the one hand, we see the U.S. pressuring

Japan to open its goods and capital markets while at the same
time threatening Japan with increased protectionist measures.
While

this may be an expedient way to reduce the trade imbalance,

it is glaringly hyprocritical and hardly conducive to mutual
trust and respect.
For its part, Japan seems too slow to realize that:

Exacerbating these basic problems is the fact that

appreciation has apparently not been a strong force in reducing the
trade imbalance. Masaya Miyoshi of the Keidanren (Japan's Federation
of

Economic Organizations) has remarked that

the

United States attaches importance to the
results (while) Japan ... places importance on
good intention more that anything else.26

If there is some truth to Miyoshi's observation, the salient
effect

of exchange rate realignment might lie, not in decreasing

the trade imbalance, but in increasing trade friction.

is becoming increasingly clear that the strong

17. The standard explanation for this pattern is
the so—called "J—Curve" effect. According to this
theory, foreign goods ordered before a plunge
in the value of the domestic currency but paid for
after the drop in that currency increase the cost
of imports, temporarily increasing that country's
trade deficit. This has surely been part of the
reason why yen appreciation did not reduce the
Japan—U.S. trade imbalance in the first half of
1986. Eventually, however, yen appreciation
should bring some improvement in the Japan—
U.S.trade imbalance. How much improvement depends
upon factors such as Japanese firms' determination
to maintain export market shares by avoiding price
increases. Another important factor is that,
while the dollar has depreciated substantially
against the yen, the dollar's trade weighted
decline against 25 currences dropped by only 5
from September 1985 — July 1986 (see Business
Week, July 28, 1986). Thus, even if yen
appreciation eventually improves the Japan—U.S.
trade imbalance, the U.S. may remain in deficit
vis—a—vis other trading partners.

This article indicates that, for all industries other than
the information sector, wage hikes in 1986 were lower than
in 1985. This pattern was attributed to the hardship wrought
by yen appreciation.

to hift

In addition, the leading candidates cited for such hollowing
out were the automotive and electronics industries.

28. An additional factor driving Japanese firms to loeate abroad,
particularly in the U.S., is the threat of U.S. protectionist
measures. As an example, a recent article in the JaDan
Economic Journal describes Toshiba's decision to produce VCRs
in the U.S.

Only a year ago, most producers were cautious about making
VCRs
in the U.S.,
citing difficulty in
procuring
components locally. Political considerations, arising
from increasing bilateral trade friciton, however, have
prompted them to enter into local production ventures
that are apparently costlier than in Japan
("Toshiba
to Start Making VCRs in U.S.
Following
Hitachi," Japan Economic Journal, August 16, 1986, p. 13).
