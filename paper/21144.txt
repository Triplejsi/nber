The Impact of Disability Benefits on Labor Supply: Evidence from the VA's Disability Compensation
Program

ABSTRACT
Combining administrative data from the U.S. Army, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the
U.S. Social Security Administration, we analyze the effect of the VA’s Disability Compensation (DC)
program on veterans’ labor force participation and earnings. The largely unstudied Disability Compensation
program currently provides income and health insurance to almost four million veterans of military
service who suffer service-connected disabilities. We study a unique policy change, the 2001 Agent
Orange decision, which expanded DC eligibility for Vietnam veterans who had served in-theatre to
a broader set of conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Exploiting the fact that the Agent Orange policy
excluded Vietnam era veterans who did not serve in-theatre, we assess the causal effects of DC eligibility
by contrasting the outcomes of these two Vietnam-era veteran groups. The Agent Orange policy catalyzed
a sharp increase in DC enrollment among veterans who served in-theatre, raising the share receiving
benefits by five percentage points over five years. Disability ratings and payments rose rapidly among
those newly enrolled, with average annual non-taxed federal transfer payments increasing to $17K
within five years. We estimate that benefits receipt reduced labor force participation by 18 percentage
points among veterans enrolled due to the policy, though measured income net of transfer benefits
rose on average. Consistent with the relatively advanced age and diminished health of Vietnam era
veterans in this period, we estimate labor force participation elasticities that are somewhat higher than
among the general population.

Introduction
This paper investigates the effect of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA’s) Disability
Compensation (DC) program on the labor supply of military veterans. Since the ratification of the U.S.
Constitution in 1789, the federal government has provided cash benefits to disabled veterans. During the
Civil War, the benefit was revised from a flat payment scheme to a graduated schedule based on disability
severity. Multiple governmental agencies administered Veterans’ benefits until the summer of 1930, when
they were consolidated under a new federal agency called the Veterans’ Administration.1
We focus on a major legislative change that took effect in 2001, which generated a plausibly
exogenous increase in the generosity of disability benefits for one group of Vietnam Era veterans but not
another.2 Motivated by an Institute of Medicine study that linked exposure to Agent Orange and other
herbicides used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War to the onset of type 2 diabetes, the VA in
July of 2001 expanded the medical eligibility criteria for Vietnam veterans to include diabetes as a
covered condition. This coverage expansion applied to veterans who served “in-theatre” in Vietnam,
Cambodia, or Laos during the 1964 to 1975 period. It did not, however, apply to the approximately 55
percent of Vietnam era veterans who did not serve in theatre during the war.
The 2001 policy change coincided with a sharp acceleration in the number of veterans receiving DC
benefits, documented in Figure 1. Some of this overall increase was attributable to a much higher rate of
DC enrollment among veterans serving in the 1990s and 2000s than among their counterparts from earlier
service eras.3 But much of it was driven by the rise in DC enrollment among Vietnam era veterans. As
shown in Figure 2, the fraction of Vietnam era veterans receiving DC benefits had been trending up

This was changed to the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989.

See Gruber (2000) for an analysis of a reform to the federal government’s disability program in all parts of Canada
except for Quebec that is estimated to have reduced labor supply.
3

Veterans from the Gulf War and Global War on Terror are 2-3 times more likely than veterans from WWII or the
Korean War era to receive DC benefits. Shifts in the composition of veterans (as those from older eras die and the
recent era join the ranks) have contributed to a substantial increase in total DC enrollment.
1

gradually prior to the 2001 policy change so that 9 percent of Vietnam-era veterans received DC benefits
in that year. But there was a significant break in that trend after 2001 so that by 2013 more than 17
percent of Vietnam era veterans were receiving DC benefits. No similar changes in rates of DC
enrollment occurred for veterans from earlier service eras.4
The policy-induced increase in DC enrollment provides an unusual opportunity to study how
disability benefits affect the labor supply of near elderly male veterans. Adopting the terminology used by
the military, we distinguish among ‘boots on the ground’ (BOG) Vietnam era veterans—the veterans
directly affected by the Agent Orange policy—with ‘not on ground’ (NOG) veterans, whose DC benefit
eligibility was not expanded. We analyze unique administrative data for a sample of more than 4 million
U.S. Army veterans to compare the evolution of labor market outcomes among BOG veterans to other
Vietnam era veterans who did not serve in the Vietnam theatre during the conflict there. By using other
Vietnam era veterans as our comparison group, we account for the possibility that veterans would have
retired sooner (or later) than non-veterans for reasons unrelated to the DC program. And given the large
number of years of pre-2001 data included in our research data, we can control for possible differential
trends between BOG and NOG veterans.
A large body of research investigates the effects of U.S. federal disability programs on health,
employment, poverty, consumption and welfare.5 This research has focused almost exclusively on the
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, with early studies considering the effects on labor
force participation (Parsons, 1980; Bound, 1989; Bound and Waidmann, 1992) and subsequent studies
exploring the sensitivity of the program to economic conditions (Black et al, 2002) and the labor market
effects of changes in the program’s medical eligibility criteria and in effective replacement rates (Autor
and Duggan, 2003).6 One challenge for this research is that, because SSDI is a federal program, there is

4

See Duggan, Rosenheck, and Singleton (2010) for a comparison to veterans from earlier service eras.

5

See for example the Handbook chapter by Bound and Burkhauser (1999).

6

The labor supply consequences of the federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program are rarely studied
because SSI largely serves individuals with extremely limited prior work histories (those with significant work
histories normally qualify for SSDI).
2

no natural comparison group against which to estimate the effects of the program. To address this issue,
more recent research has estimated the effect of SSDI on the labor supply of applicants and beneficiaries
by using variation in the propensity to award disability benefits across disability examiners (Maestas et al,
2013; Autor et al., 2014) and administrative law judges (French and Song, 2014). The findings from these
studies, which utilize large-scale administrative data sets on both SSDI enrollment and earnings, suggest
that labor force participation among marginal applicants—that is, those who would receive an SSDI
award from a lenient judge or examiner but not from a stricter one—declines by about thirty percentage
points as a result of receiving an SSDI award.7
There has been much less research on the VA’s Disability Compensation program. Autor and Duggan
(2007), Autor et al (2011), and Coile et al (2015) use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to
explore how labor force participation changed for male Vietnam-era veterans relative to similarly aged
non-veteran males after the 2001 policy change. All three studies demonstrate a significantly larger
decline in labor force participation among Vietnam-era veterans in the post-2001 period, though their
confidence intervals are compatible with a wide range of effect sizes. A concern with this body of work is
that veterans might retire sooner than non-veterans for reasons unrelated to the DC program.8 Using the
Vietnam-era draft lottery as an instrumental variable for Vietnam-era military service, Angrist et al (2010)
estimate that employment was lower and transfer income receipt was higher among low skilled veterans
than among low-skilled non-veterans. They hypothesize that the lower employment rate of Vietnam-era
veterans is due to the availability of Veterans Disability Compensation benefits. In related work on the
labor supply of veterans, Boyle and Lahey (2010) study the expansion of the Veterans Health Insurance

7

Using an approach similar to Bound (1989), Chen and van der Klauuw (2008) estimate even smaller effects of
SSDI enrollment, with an upper bound of a 20 percent reduction in labor force participation. Results from Von
Wachter et al (2011) suggest labor supply effects may be larger for younger SSDI recipients. While SSDI reduces
the incentive to work among recipients, the results of a recent policy change in Norway suggest that disability
insurance recipients are responsive to changes in the magnitude of this incentive (Kostøl and Mogstad, 2014).
8

Duggan et al (2010) use five years of data (odd-numbered years between 1997 and 2005) from the Veterans’
Supplement to the CPS to compare changes in labor force participation among Vietnam veterans who served in
theatre and other Vietnam era veterans. Given the small sample size, their estimates are very imprecise, as their
confidence interval includes the full range of possible effect sizes (zero effect or a one-for-one reduction in labor
force participation).
3

program to non-disabled veterans in the mid-1990s to analyze changes in labor force participation
stemming from increased real incomes and reductions in “job lock.”
Using individual-level data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, we document that DC
receipt and enrollment growth were higher among BOG than NOG veterans prior to 2001, but these gaps
were relatively stable. After 2001, however, the rate of DC enrollment grew much more rapidly among
BOG veterans, as shown in Figure 3. Between 2000 and 2006, the ratio of DC receipt among BOG
relative to NOG veterans rose from approximately two-to-one to three-to-one: almost one-in-four BOG
veterans in our analysis sample received DC benefits in 2006 versus one-in-twelve among veterans in our
NOG sample. This trend break was driven primarily by a sharp increase in the number of diabetes awards
to BOG veterans as shown in Figure 4. DC enrollment growth among BOG veterans shows essentially no
break in trend when one excludes DC recipients with a diabetes diagnosis (Figure 5). Using matched data
from the Social Security Administration, we also document a differential increase in SSDI enrollment
after 2001 among BOG veterans. A plausible channel for this effect, which is about one-tenth as large as
the corresponding change in DC enrollment, is that receipt of veterans disability benefits eases financial
constraints associated with exiting the labor force and applying for SSDI benefits. Moreover, since SSA
regulations require disability adjudicators to consider disability decisions of other federal agencies (U.S.
General Accounting Office, 2009), a veteran’s enrollment in DC may also increase the likelihood that he
or she applies for and ultimately receives Social Security disability benefits.
By generating a sharp differential increase in DC enrollment among BOG veterans for reasons
unrelated to changing health, the Agent Orange policy change permits causal estimation of the effect of
DC program participation on the labor supply of near-elderly Vietnam veterans. Analyzing this policyinduced variation, we find that labor force participation, defined as having strictly positive earnings for
the year in our administrative data, declined sharply among BOG relative to NOG veterans soon after the
2001 policy change. The results are similar for younger (born 1949-51) and older (born 1946-48) Vietnam
veterans in our analysis sample, suggesting that this pattern reflects an effect of the policy rather than a
tendency of BOG veterans to retire sooner than their NOG counterparts for reasons unrelated to the DC
4

program. For every 100 individuals who entered the DC program as a result of the policy change, we
estimate that 18 drop out of the labor force. The magnitude of this decline reflects in part the size of the
cash transfers that DC beneficiaries receive. Among veterans who entered the DC program after 2001,
annual benefits averaged $10K in the first year of enrollment and $17K in the fifth year of enrollment.
Since DC benefits are not subject to state or federal taxation, their after tax value is 30 to 40 percent
greater than nominally equivalent labor income. Indeed, the increase in disability benefit income among
BOG veterans more than offset (on average) their reduction in earnings among BOG veterans, so that
total incomes of BOG relative to NOG veterans rose steadily after 2001.
Combining our labor force participation and benefit receipt estimates, we obtain a non-participation
elasticity of 0.50. This estimate is larger than the figure of 0.16 reported by Coile and Gruber (2007) for
the elasticity of retirement of near-elderly adults with respect to Social Security and other retirement
wealth.9 Our estimates are highly consistent with the participation elasticities calculated by Boyle and
Lahey (2010), however, who studied labor supply of older non-disabled veterans ages 55 through 64 who
were granted access to VA health insurance in the mid-1990s.
Distinct from the SSDI program, which provides income replacement for beneficiaries who are
unable to work due to disability, DC benefits are awarded as compensation for service-related reductions
in health and thus, for the most part, are not contingent on veterans’ past or present employment. This
observation would suggest that any DC-induced reduction in labor supply that we detect would be
attributable to a non-incentive income effect. However, nearly 14 percent of BOG veterans who were
receiving DC by the end of our sample window were receiving maximum DC benefits of approximately
$2,900 monthly because they were deemed unable to work (‘Individually Unemployable’ or IU) due to
their disability. For veterans receiving the IU benefit and those seeking it, the labor supply effects that we
estimate are likely to encompass both income and incentive effects.

9

A venerable literature estimates labor supply elasticites, including Frisch (1959), Ashenfelter and Heckman (1974),
Abbott and Ashenfelter (1976), and Chetty (2012) among many key contributions. Very few studies estimate income
elasticites of participation, however. McClelland and Mok (2012) provide a recent review.
5

The labor supply effects that we document acquire added significance in light of the rapid growth in
Disability Compensation enrollment, with annual benefit payments of $49.2 billion in 2013 (U.S.
Veterans Benefits Administration, 2014). Today’s veterans are substantially more likely than U.S.
veterans of earlier cohorts to obtain DC benefits; indeed, veterans who have exited military service since
2001 are more than three times as likely as were Vietnam era veterans to receive disability compensation
benefits soon after the completion of service. This cross-cohort contrast suggests that Veterans Disability
Compensation program costs may rise substantially beyond what would be predicted based on earlier
generations of veterans, a concern highlighted by Bilmes and Stiglitz (2008).
The analysis proceeds as follows. Section I discusses the financial and labor force participation
incentives created by the Veterans Disability Compensation program. Section II describes the 2001 Agent
Orange decision that made type 2 diabetes a service-connected disability for veterans who served in the
Vietnam theatre. Section III details the construction of our data, which we use in Section IV to analyze
the impact of the Agent Orange decision on veterans’ enrollment in DC and their receipt of transfer
income from DC and two other federal disability programs, SSDI and Supplemental Security Income
(SSI). Section V presents reduced form estimates of the impact of the Agent Orange policy on labor force
participation and total labor earnings. Section VI combines these margins to provide instrumental
variables estimates of the impact of DC enrollment and total disability benefits payments on labor force
participation. Section VII documents the effect of the Agent Orange policy on total measured income
inclusive of disability benefits and net of any induced change in labor supply. Section VIII concludes.

I.  

The Veterans Disability Compensation Program: Eligibility, Benefits and Work Incentives
The DC program pays cash benefits and provides prioritized access to VA health facilities to military

veterans with service-connected medical conditions, meaning that they are caused or aggravated by their
military service. Unlike SSDI and SSI, federal programs that classify disability using a categorical (all-ornothing) determination, the DC program rates disability on a discrete scale with eleven gradations ranging
from zero to 100 percent in ten percent increments. Ratings depend on the type and severity of the
6

disability, with more severe conditions receiving a higher rating.10 If the recipient receives ratings for
multiple disabilities, the recipient’s Combined Disability Rating (CDR) is an increasing, concave function
of the individual ratings, where concavity prevents the combined rating from exceeding 100 percent.11
A.   Eligibility and benefits
Veterans seeking DC benefits apply to one of 56 regional offices of the Veterans Benefit
Administration (VBA), which collects necessary information and forwards the information to a Rating
Board. For each disability claimed, the Rating Board determines whether the disability is verified,
whether it is service connected, and if so, what rating it merits. During the 2000 fiscal year, more than 70
percent of those applying for DC sought benefits for more than one medical condition (U.S. Veterans
Benefits Administration, 2001). Applicants face one of three possible outcomes: outright rejection, an
award for some but not all conditions, or an award for all conditions. In 2006, current DC beneficiaries
averaged 2.97 disabilities per recipient, with the highest number of disabilities per capita among Gulf War
and Vietnam Era veterans, and the lowest number among WWII veterans (U.S. Veterans Benefits
Administration, 2007).
Monthly benefits awarded by DC are an increasing and convex function of the veteran’s CDR. In
2014, a 10 percent award provided a monthly payment of $131 whereas a 100 percent award provided a
monthly payment of $2,858.12 Veterans receiving a CDR of 30 percent or higher and who have spouses,

10

The range of possible ratings differs among disabilities. For example, type 2 diabetes can have a rating of 10, 20,
40, 60, or 100 percent. Arthritis can be assigned a rating of 10 or 20 percent. For a list of conditions and ratings see
http://www.warms.vba.va.gov/bookc.html. A disability with a 0 percent rating would not increase the monthly cash
benefit but would entitle the veteran to priority for health care through the Veterans Health Administration.
11

If a claimant has multiple disabilities, only the claimant's ‘residual ability’ is considered when determining the
effect of each additional disability on the CDR. For example, if a veteran has two disabilities rated at 50%, his CDR
would be he equal to the sum of 50% for the first disability and 50% of his residual capacity of 50% for the second
disability, all rounded to the nearest increment of 10%. Thus, two disabilities rated at 50% results in a CDR of [0.5 +
(1 – 0.5) * 0.5] = 0.75, which is then rounded up to 0.80.
12

The stated policy of the VBA that the DC benefits schedule reflects the average reduction in earnings capacity for
each value of the CDR. Since benefits determination depends only on CDR and family status, it is clear that the
benefit payment will exceed the earnings loss for some veterans and fail to meet the earnings loss of others. In 2014,
the monthly benefit schedule (by CDR) was: $131 (10%), $259 (20%), $401 (30%), $578 (40%), $822 (50%),
$1,041 (60%), $1,312 (70%), $1,526 (80%), $1,714 (90%), and $2,858 (100%).
7

dependent children, or surviving parents also receive modest additional benefits. The VBA also considers
employment capability for veterans with severe disabilities. Veterans who have single disabilities rated at
60 percent or above or a combined disability rating of at least 70 and one disability rated at least 40 can
qualify for the Individual Unemployability (IU) designation if VBA determines that they are unable to “to
secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability.” Veterans
receiving the IU designation are provided cash payments at the 100 percent CDR level even if their CDR
is less than 100 percent.
Veterans Disability Compensation benefits typically have longer award durations and fewer work
restrictions than other federal disability benefits. DC benefits are also not subject to federal income or
payroll tax; hence, a dollar in DC income is roughly equivalent to $1.30 to $1.50 in pre-tax earned
income, depending upon the recipient’s marginal tax rate. DC benefits generally do not offset and are not
offset by other federal transfer benefits, and, once awarded, are rarely retracted.13 Unlike federal SSDI
benefits, DC benefits do not terminate when a recipient reaches retirement age, even for recipients
receiving the IU benefit. Moreover, a veteran’s ongoing receipt of DC benefits is neither work-contingent
nor income-contingent, except for veterans who have received the IU rating.14 Thus, DC benefits are
roughly akin to an inflation-indexed annuity that provides monthly payments for as long as a veteran
remains alive.
Appendix Table 1 summarizes DC cash benefits paid in fiscal year 2006, the final year for which we
have individual-level DC data in the analyses below. The first three columns enumerate the count of
recipients, the total dollars paid, and the average annual benefit in each CDR category at the end of fiscal
year 2006. The average annual payment to the 2.73 million DC recipients in this year was $10,862 per

13

A Veteran may receive both DC and SSDI payments without any reduction in benefits from either program,
though SSI payments will generally be reduced or eliminated by DC payments.
14

A veteran can lose the IU rating if his annual labor market earnings (measured by SSA earnings data) exceeds a
threshold amount, which was equal to $6,000 in 2004 and 2005. The General Accounting Office notes, however,
that “this process relies on old data, outdated and time-consuming procedures, insufficient guidance, and weak
eligibility criteria” (GAO 2006, p. 23).

capita, totaling approximately $29.6 billion for the year. Veterans with ratings between 0 and 20 percent
accounted for 44 percent of recipients but just 8 percent of dollars paid. Those with ratings at 70 percent
or above comprised 21 percent of the population and received 62 percent of the benefits payments.15
Total DC benefits payments rose from $20.8 billion to $49.1 billion between 2001 and 2013 (in
constant 2013 dollars). Simultaneously, the estimated veteran population declined from 26.1 million to
22.1 million (VBA, 2002 and 2014). As a result of these changes, real annual DC expenditures per living
veteran increased by 180 percent (from $798 to $2,234).
B.   Work Incentives under DC
The graduated scale of DC disability ratings creates a complex set of incentives. Though disability
ratings for DC recipients notionally depend exclusively on medical criteria rather than employment status,
veterans may nevertheless perceive that their disabilities will receive higher ratings if they are not
employed when applying to obtain or increase benefits. Veterans also face an incentive to repeatedly
reapply to increase their Combined Disability Ratings—and therefore their benefits—as their health
conditions evolve.16 One consequence is that veterans’ CDRs and benefit levels tend to rise steeply in the
years following enrollment, as shown in panels A and B of Table 1.17 This pattern of rapidly escalating
benefits following enrollment suggests that policies that induce veterans to obtain an initial DC award,
even at a low CDR, may lead to substantially larger claims over the longer term and discourage labor
force participation.
The availability of the Individual IU designation is likely to amplify these incentives. The IU benefit
has significant monetary value: a 2006 General Accounting Office report found that the average present

15

The average monthly benefit amounts for those with ratings between 0 and 20 percent are very close to the
baseline amounts because veterans with these ratings are not eligible for dependent benefits. The average amounts
paid for those rated 60 percent and higher are substantially greater than the baseline amounts because many of these
recipients are eligible for the 100 percent payment amount because they are receiving the IU benefit.
16

In fact, we observe very few reductions in CDRs in our data, and it is possible that those few that exist reflect
coding errors. Veterans face little risk of having their CDRs reduced after the initial award.
17

We describe the sample used to construct Table 1 in Section III below. Although our data codes DC receipt in
each year from 1998 through 2006, we can only determine what year DC was awarded if a veteran is observed not
receiving DC in a prior year. We can thus identify DC enrollment cohorts from 1999 forward, but not for 1998.
9

discounted incremental value of receiving an IU award in 2005 was approximately $300 to $460 thousand
for veterans age 20 (net of existing benefits), and was $89 to $142 thousand for veterans age 75 (U.S.
GAO, 2006).18 The availability of this benefit appears likely to induce at least some subset of workcapable veterans to curtail labor force participation to qualify. Once the IU designation is awarded,
veterans face an incentive to maintain low earnings since the benefit is technically only available for those
with labor market earnings at or below the poverty level for a single individual (U.S. GAO, 2006).19
The DC program may also alter work incentives through its interactions with other federal benefits
programs, SSDI in particular. Though the DC and SSDI programs have distinct disability screening
criteria, the medical information generated by the DC award may alert some veterans that they suffer
from impairments that could merit an SSDI award (and vice versa). Receipt of DC benefits may also
render the SSDI application process less financially onerous, since SSDI applicants must remain out of
the labor force for at least five months before receiving SSDI benefits. Because cash benefits from the
two programs are additive rather than offsetting, it is plausible that a veteran’s receipt of either DC or
SSDI benefits increases his odds of applying for the other.20

II.   The 2001 Agent Orange Decision, Type 2 Diabetes and ‘Service-Connectedness’
For a disability to be classified as service-connected, it must be “a result of disease or injury incurred
or aggravated during active military service.” This criterion makes it straightforward for a veteran to
obtain compensation for a tangible injury that occurs during military service but significantly more

18

Among veterans in our sample who received benefits at the 100 percent disability level in 2006, about half were
designated as IU. We henceforth do not distinguish between the IU benefit and 100 percent disability since many
DC recipients with 100 percent disability may have previously qualified for the IU benefit with a lower CDR.
19

The fact that only veterans with severe disabilities (a CDR of 60 or higher) are eligible for the IU benefit might be
expected to deter all but the most disabled veterans. But the data in Table 1 indicate that very high CDRs are not
uncommon, even for veterans that initially enter with low or moderate CDRs. Among veterans awarded DC benefits
in 1999, only 15 percent qualified for either the IU benefit or 100 percent disability (panel C). Seven years later, in
2006, three times that number (45 percent) of the 1999 DC enrollment cohort was either receiving the IU benefit or
was 100 percent disabled.
20

The combination of VA health benefits and Medicare benefits from SSDI may also be more attractive than either
individually since VA and Medicare differ in ailments covered, rapidity of access to treatment, size of co-pays, and
coverage of prescription drugs.
10

difficult to obtain compensation for a disease that develops later in life, such as cancer or heart disease.
Thus in 2006, the five most prevalent service-connected disabilities were primarily battle traumas:
hearing defects, tinnitus, general musculoskeletal disorders, arthritis due to trauma, and scars (U.S.
Veterans Benefits Administration, 2006). Nevertheless, disabilities that typically develop post-service are
also prevalent: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hypertensive vascular disease (high blood
pressure) were the sixth and ninth most prevalent service-connected disabilities in 2006.
In November of 2000, type 2 diabetes was added to the list of compensable and presumptively
service-connected impairments for Vietnam veterans who had served in theatre due to their potential
exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange. This policy change substantially weakened the link between
service-connectedness and DC benefits for eligible veterans. The Agent Orange policy was years in the
making. The U.S. military applied more than 19 million gallons of herbicides to defoliate Vietnamese
jungle areas between 1962 and 1971, a quantity of defoliant sufficient to cover 8.5 percent of the
country’s land area (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2003).21 After the war ended, concern grew
among veterans that their exposure to the dioxins in Agent Orange would have long-term adverse
consequences. The VA responded by establishing the Agent Orange Registry in 1978. In 1991, Congress
enacted the Agent Orange Act, which charged the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine
(IOM) with reviewing the evidence for a link between Agent Orange exposure and the prevalence of
certain medical conditions.
In a series of reports, the IOM found insufficient evidence to establish an association between dioxin
exposure and diabetes. But the publication of two new studies in 1999 and 2000 that found an association
between dioxin exposure and diabetes turned the tide against this longstanding consensus (Calvert et. al.,
1999; Air Force Health Study, 2000). In October of 2000, the IOM concluded that there was
“limited/suggestive evidence of an association between exposure to the herbicides used in Vietnam or the

21

Agent Orange accounted for more than 80 percent of the total amount of herbicide dispensed.
11

contaminant dioxin and type 2 diabetes” (IOM, 2000). 22 This in turn prompted the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs’ decision to classify type 2 diabetes as presumptively service connected.
The VA’s adoption of the Agent Orange policy offers an unusual opportunity: almost three decades
after the end of the Vietnam War, veterans who served in theatre were unexpectedly granted presumptive
eligibility for financially significant Disability Compensation benefits without a precipitating change in
health. This paper exploits the contrast in expanded benefits eligibility between in-theatre and not-intheatre veterans—whom we refer to as ‘boots on ground’ (BOG) and ‘not on ground’ (NOG) veterans—
to study the impact of benefits receipt on veterans’ labor supply.

III.   Data and Analytic Sample
Our research draws on a unique set of linked administrative data sources. The first is a near census of
approximately four million veterans who left the Army between 1968 and 1985. The U.S. Army’s Office
of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA) constructed this database by combining two files from the
Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC): the first DMDC file enumerates essentially every person who
left the Army between 1968 and 1985 (designated as the service member’s “loss year”); OEMA then
merged this “loss year” file with DMDC’s Vietnam file, which identifies the vast majority of veterans
who served in the Vietnam theatre.23 Approximately 36 percent of this sample served with boots on the
ground in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos during the Vietnam War era, and is therefore potentially directly
affected by the 2001 expansion of the DC program’s medical eligibility criteria. More than 35 percent of
the NOG sample had a start year of 1976 or later and thus did not serve during the Vietnam War era.24

22

The same 2000 report by the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine explained that any increased
risk of Type 2 diabetes due to Agent Orange appeared to be small and that family history, physical inactivity, and
obesity were far greater predictors of diabetes (IOM, 2000).
23

The file does not include the comparatively small number of Army service members who died during service.
U.S. government archives record 38,224 Army service members who were killed in action in Vietnam.
24

Veterans who were in the “loss year” file and the Vietnam file are in the BOG sample while veterans who were in
the “loss year” file but not the Vietnam file are part of the NOG sample. The Vietnam file contained loss year
information for approximately 25 percent of veterans, which explains why a small fraction of the BOG sample has a
loss year before 1968 or after 1985. Our final analysis sample, described below, excludes all veterans with loss years
before 1968 or after 1985, but does contain a few veterans who were in the Vietnam file but not in the “loss year”
12

Appendix Table 2 and Table 2 show summary statistics on the distribution of loss years, years-of-birth,
and start years for military service.
We use three additional data sources to measure mortality, employment, and disability outcomes for
Vietnam era veterans. To measure DC participation, OEMA obtained from VA detailed information about
veterans’ enrollment and DC benefits received from VA programs in September of each year from 1998
through 2006. To account for mortality, OEMA merged their data to the Social Security Administration
Death Master File (DMF), which includes the year of death for any individual in the sample who died
prior to 2008. According to DMF data, approximately 13 percent of the 4.1 million individuals in the
sample were deceased by late 2007.
To collect employment, earnings, SSDI, and SSI information, OEMA contracted with the U.S. Social
Security Administration (SSA) to match veterans in the OEMA data set to enumerate wage earnings and
Social Security benefits in each year from 1976 through 2007.25 This resulted in a successful match for
3.8 of the 4.1 million veterans in the full data set, with overall match rates exceeding 90 percent for both
BOG and NOG samples, as detailed in Appendix Table 3.
Confidentiality rules prevent SSA from disclosing individual earnings or benefits data. SSA instead
provided statistics on earnings and benefits for cells containing five to nine veterans. These statistics
include the number of cell members with zero earnings, mean labor earnings, the number receiving SSDI
and SSI, and mean SSDI and SSI benefit amounts. In constructing cells, we grouped individuals with
similar background characteristics, including gender, race, BOG and NOG status, and year of birth. Our
final analysis sample consists of veterans who joined the military between 1966 and 1971, and were born
between 1946 and 1951 (see Table 2). See the data appendix for more details on the cell construction and
sample selection.
Panel A of Table 3 compares the BOG and NOG samples. The fraction nonwhite is approximately

file. This group comprises only 1.25 percent of our final sample and our results are nearly identical when we exclude
them from our analysis.
25

SSA required a match on social security number, last name, and date of birth of each individual to make a match.
13

equal in the two samples (11.3 and 11.8 percent, respectively) as is the fraction with positive earnings in
1998 (84.4 and 85.1 percent). Among those with a non-missing Armed Forces Qualification Test score
(AFQT), the average scores are also relatively close (52.1 and 53.4). And by construction, the average
year-of-birth and the average start year are comparable in the two groups. There are clear differences
between the BOG and NOG samples as well. BOG veterans are more than twice as likely as NOG
veterans to be receiving DC benefits in 2000 (14.3 versus 6.5 percent), just prior to the 2001 policy
change described above. This in part reflects the greater toll that military service took on those who
served in the Vietnam theatre.26
An examination of trends in key outcome variables in the BOG and NOG samples prior to the 2001
policy change reveals many similarities: the fraction with zero earnings increased by similar, though not
identical, amounts for both samples between 1998 to 2000 (by 1.5 and 1.0 points for BOG and NOG
samples, respectively), as did the fraction receiving SSDI benefits (1.2 and 0.9 points for BOG and NOG
samples). Our analysis will control for any differential trends in outcome variables that precede the policy
change.
A remaining concern with the primary analytic sample is that individuals who are matched in the SSA
data may systematically differ from those who are not. This is especially an issue for veterans who died
prior to 1997. As shown in columns 3 and 4 of panel B in Table 3, the fraction of veterans in the full
sample who were deceased as of 1997 was 6.2 and 6.1 percent in the full BOG and NOG samples but
only 4.8 and 2.9 percent in the SSA verified samples—though, notably, the fraction of veterans who died
between 1997 and 2007 in the BOG and NOG samples is closely comparable in both the full sample and
the SSA verified sample.27 The lower SSA match rate for deceased veterans is a consequence of SSA’s
record matching criteria, which require a match on subjects’ full names as well as SSN and date of birth.

26

Additionally, members of the NOG sample are more likely to have missing data on education and less likely to be
missing AFQT score data.
27

We constructed the sample summarized in panel B of Table 3 in the same manner as the sample summarized in
panel A, except that we did not exclude veterans who did not match with SSA earnings information.
14

Due to poor optical character recognition, the NOG data contained a relatively high frequency of garbled
names. We worked with the credit information provider TransUnion to obtain names for those with
incomplete information.28 Due to limited availability of archival credit information prior to 1997,
TransUnion could not provide names for most veterans who passed away before that same year, leading
to a low overall match rate for NOG soldiers who died prior to 1997. Differential mortality match for the
BOG and NOG samples is not a major threat to the validity of our research design, however, since our
primary focus is on outcomes from 1998 forward. Thus, soldiers who were deceased as of 1997 are
excluded from the analysis.
To benchmark the representativeness of the sample, we compare the OEMA data with a similarly
drawn group of males from the 2000 IPUMS Census file. Using the 5 percent Census IPUMS extract, we
draw a group of all males born between 1946 and 1951, and further limit the sample to (self-reported)
Vietnam-era veterans.29 Appendix Table 4 provides a side-by-side comparison of age, race, schooling,
annual earnings, and share with non-zero earnings in the OEMA and Census samples. Race and labor
force participation rates are closely comparable: the fractions of the OEMA and Census samples with
non-zero earnings are 84.1 percent and 82.2 percent, respectively, while the percent nonwhite are 11.3
and 13.3. Reflecting the fact that OEMA data code education at the time of military enlistment (average
age of 20) while the Census data code educational attainment in late adulthood, the OEMA sample reports
considerably lower educational attainment than the Census sample. Average earnings in the OEMA
sample are also about 10 percent lower than in the Census sample. This gap may reflect earnings
differences between Army veterans and those of other branches of the military. SSA data may also fail to
capture some earnings sources, including self-employment and non-covered work. Overall, our

28

TransUnion performed this work pro bono. Our original sample had 1.7 million observations with a missing
name. TransUnion was able to provide names for 1.5 million of these observations upon confirming a match with
date of birth and social security number.
29

The Census data do not allow us to distinguish among veterans according to their branch of military service. To
the extent that Army veterans are different from their counterparts serving in the Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast
Guard, we would expect some differences between the Census and OEMA samples.
15

comparison of OEMA and Census data provides some assurance that the OEMA sample is representative
of the target population of Vietnam era Army veterans, measured in terms of age, race, labor force
participation and earnings.

IV.   The Impact of the Agent Orange Policy on Receipt of Disability Benefits
The Agent Orange policy spurred a steep rise in Disability Compensation enrollment, and may
potentially have had spillover effects on enrollment in other federal disability programs as well. We begin
by estimating impacts on DC enrollment, followed by SSDI and SSI enrollment, and finally, total federal
disability benefits.
A.   Enrollment in Veterans Disability Compensation
Figure 3 plots the fraction of BOG and NOG veterans receiving DC benefits in September of each
year from 1998 through 2006. Prior to the Agent Orange change in 2001, DC enrollment was rising
somewhat more rapidly among BOG than NOG veterans. But DC enrollment among BOG veterans
accelerated substantially after 2001. Column 2 of panel A in Table 4 shows that BOG DC enrollment
increased by 0.4 percentage points per year between 1998 and 2000 (13.5 to 14.3) and by 1.6 percentage
points annually between 2001 and 2006 (15.0 to 23.0). In contrast, DC enrollment growth rates among
NOG veterans remained small and relatively steady, increasing from 0.1 percentage points per year
between 1998 and 2000 (6.3 to 6.5) to 0.2 percentage points per year between 2001 and 2006 (6.6 to
7.6).30 Data from the National Health Interview Survey (Schiller et al, 2010) indicate that the fraction of
individuals with diabetes varies substantially by race, with rates among blacks substantially higher than
among whites. Consistent with this fact, an examination of the trends in DC enrollment in Table 4 reveals
substantial differences by race in the BOG sample, with DC enrollment increasing about 40 percent more
among BOG nonwhites (19.3 to 30.2, 10.9 percentage points) than among BOG whites from 2001 to

30

The policy change took effect in July of 2001 and we measure DC enrollment in September. Thus, our 2001 data
is arguably more “pre” than “post,” though it’s likely that the policy change did contribute to DC enrollment growth
between September 2000 and September 2001 in our data.
16

2006 (14.4 to 22.1, 7.7 percentage points).
These raw differences in DC enrollment trends between BOG and NOG veterans may reflect
differences in veteran characteristics in addition to any impact of the Agent Orange policy. To account for
these factors, we estimate a set of OLS models that regress DC enrollment on a full set of controls for
veterans’ year-of-birth, race, and AFQT score quintile.31 For consistency with the subsequent analysis of
labor market outcomes, our DC variables are calculated as means over five to nine veterans grouped at the
level of SSA reporting cells.32 We estimate the following equation for 1998 through 2006, weighting each
cell-year by the number of individuals in the cell:
(1)

𝑌"# = 𝛼# + 𝛾( ×𝐵𝑂𝐺" +

-((.
/000 𝛾# ×𝐵𝑂𝐺"

+ 𝑋"#2 𝛽# + 𝜀"#

The outcome variable 𝑌"# is the percentage of cell 𝑗 enrolled in the DC program in September of year 𝑡,
and 𝐵𝑂𝐺" is an indicator variable that is set equal to one if veterans in cell 𝑗 are in the BOG sample and is
otherwise equal to zero (cells include either all BOG or all NOG veterans). The term 𝛼# is a vector of nine
indicator variables for each year considered, and 𝑋"# is a vector set of 14 variables corresponding to the
possible values of year-of-birth, AFQT quintile, and race.33 We interact each of these 14 indicator
variables with nine year-specific indicator variables to account for differential levels of growth rates in
DC enrollment by age, race, or AFQT level during the 1998 through 2006 period. The coefficient 𝛾(

31

Veterans with low AFQT scores are more likely to enroll in DC (Autor et al 2011), and average scores differ
slightly between BOG and NOG veterans.
32

SSA outcomes are only available at the cell level due to confidentiality restrictions, as discussed above. Because
we apply OLS models to cell means and weight by the number of individual observations in each cell, the cell level
estimates will be in most cases algebraically identical to those that we would obtain if cells were instead
disaggregated to individual level rows. The one exception to this dictum arises from the fact that ten percent of cells
in have more than one AFQT quintile represented within the cell. We assign the cell to the AFQT quintile nearest to
the cell’s mean AFQT quintile in these cases, meaning that the cell-level and corresponding individual level
regressions will differ slightly.
33

In our sample there are six possible values of YOB (1946 through 1951), two possible values of race (white and
nonwhite), and six possible values of AFQT quintiles (we group those with a missing AFQT into a sixth category).
Given there are nine years of data used in these estimates, we are including 126 interactions. Veterans within each
cell have the same year-of-birth and race (by construction) and the vast majority also have the same AFQT quintile.
Data for each veteran is included in each of these nine years unless the veteran dies at some point between 1998 and
2006, in which case the veteran is dropped from the sample. Year-of-death is one of the variables used to construct
the cells, so typically the entire cell is dropped.
17

corresponds to the (conditional) baseline DC enrollment gap between BOG and NOG veterans in the base
year of 1998, while the coefficient vector 𝛾# estimates the difference in this gap in each subsequent year
1999 through 2006 relative to the enrollment gap in 1998.
The statistically significant estimate of 6.97 for 𝛾( in the first column of panel A, Table 5 implies a 7
percentage point gap in DC enrollment between the BOG and NOG samples in the baseline year (1998)
after controlling for race, year-of-birth, and AFQT quintile, quite similar to the unconditional estimated
difference of 7.2 percentage points in columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 (13.5 for BOG versus 6.3 for NOG).
The next eight rows of the first column in Table 5 display the estimates for 𝛾# in each year from 1999
through 2006. The statistically significant estimates of 0.33 and 0.59 for 𝛾/000 and 𝛾-((( imply that DC
enrollment was increasing more rapidly (by 0.3 percentage points annually) for the BOG than NOG
sample prior to the 2001 policy change. Beginning in 2001, these coefficients increase much more
rapidly, by about 1.4 percentage points per year, and reach a cumulative differential of 7.98 percentage
points by September of 2006. As shown in panels B and C of Table 5, the point estimates differ only
modestly by birth cohort (1946-48 and 1949-51), with slightly larger effects for the older than the
younger group (8.28 and 7.65 percentage points, respectively).
The sharp break in trend for DC enrollment among BOG relative to NOG veterans motivates a
parameterized version of equation (1) found in even-numbered columns of Table 5. For this specification,
we replace the full set of year-by-BOG interactions with two linear time trends: a pre-2001 trend and a
post-2001 trend change, estimated relative to the pre-2001 trend:
(2) 𝑌"# = 𝛼# + 𝛾( ×𝐵𝑂𝐺" + 𝛿( ×𝐵𝑂𝐺" × 𝑡 − 1998 + 𝛿/ ×𝐵𝑂𝐺" × 𝑡 − 2001 ×1 𝑡 ≥ 2002 + 𝑋"#2 𝛽# + 𝜀"#
Here, 𝛿( captures the pre-existing trend in BOG relative to NOG DC participation just prior to the policy
change while 𝛿/ estimates any additional change in the BOG relative to the NOG trend following the
policy. We define 2002 to be the first post-policy year in this specification given that most of the time
from September 2000 to September 2001 occurred before the policy took effect in July 2001. To interpret
𝛿/ as the causal effect of the Agent Orange policy change on DC enrollment, we must assume that the

18

pre-existing trend in the difference in DC enrollment between the BOG and NOG samples would have
continued after 2001.
The estimates in the even-numbered columns of Table 5 highlight the significant trend increase in DC
enrollment among BOG relative to NOG veterans following the 2001 policy change. Because we treat
2001 as a pure pre-policy year, the estimate of 𝛿( in each case is slightly larger and the estimate of 𝛿/
slightly smaller than is suggested by the year-by-year estimates. The magnitude of the trend break is
similar between the two birth cohort groups (1946-48 and 1949-51). In panel A of Table 6, we split the
sample by race (white/nonwhite) and by AFQT score. The acceleration in DC enrollment is largest among
BOG veterans who are nonwhite and have relatively low (below the 40th percentile in the sample) AFQT
scores.34
Figures 4 and 5 relate these enrollment trends to the Agent Orange policy. Figure 4 documents a steep
increase in the likelihood that BOG (but not NOG) veterans receive compensation for diabetes, both in
the year of current DC receipt and in the year of initial DC enrollment. As documented in Panel C of
Table 4, the fraction of DC beneficiaries receiving compensation for diabetes among BOG veterans rose
from 2.4 to 28.1 percent (25.7 points) between 2001 and 2006 versus 1.6 to 6.4 percent among NOG
veterans (4.8 points).35 Yet, as shown in Figure 5, there was only a modest increase in the fraction of
veterans receiving DC benefits absent a diabetes award. Thus, the rapid growth in DC enrollment appears
substantially accounted for by an influx of new diabetes awards. Figure 6 underscores that the increase in
DC enrollment was similarly rapid among older (YOB 1946-48) and younger (YOB 1949-51) Vietnam
veterans in our sample, as indicated by the regression estimates in Table 5.

34

We drop cells with missing AFQT scores for these specifications.

35

There are three likely reasons that DC receipt for diabetes increased in the NOG. One is that our data only
imperfectly classify BOG and NOG veterans; some veterans categorized as NOG may in fact have served in theatre
and hence presumptively qualified for service-connectedness for their type 2 diabetes. A second cause is that
administration of DC benefits appears to be somewhat discretionary. Even prior to the Agent Orange decision in
2000, 1.4 percent of BOG and 0.7 percent of NOG DC recipients were receiving compensation for serviceconnected diabetes (panel C of Table 4). Finally, some NOG veterans may have served in Korea in 1968 or 1969.
This source of slippage does not invalidate our identification strategy provided that the post-2001 trend break in DC
receipt in BOG versus NOG veterans is induced by the Agent Orange Policy change, which seems quite plausible.
19

The estimates so far capture the extensive margin impact of the Agent Orange policy on DC
participation. Panels B and C of Table 6 consider outcome measures that combine responses along the
extensive (enrollment) and intensive (rated severity) margins: Combined Disability Ratings (CDRs) and
annual benefits payments, both of which are continuous measures of DC participation.36 Both CDRs and
annual benefit payments rose significantly more rapidly for BOG than NOG veterans after 2001. Panel B
of Table 6 shows that prior to the Agent Orange policy, average CDRs of BOG relative to NOG veterans
were rising at 0.34 percentage points annually; after 2001, this differential trend tripled to 1.00 percentage
points annually (0.34 + 0.66). Similarly, panel C indicates that the year-over-year increase in annual mean
DC benefits paid to BOG relative to NOG veterans rose from $113 prior to the policy change to $305 per
year after 2001 ($113 + $192). Consistent with the estimates for DC enrollment by race and AFQT score,
the remaining columns of panels B and C demonstrate that CDRs and benefits payments increased more
rapidly among nonwhite than white BOG veterans, and more rapidly among low-AFQT than high-AFQT
BOG veterans.
B.   Enrollment in other Federal Disability Programs
A significant constraint that some workers face when applying for SSDI benefits is that they are
unlikely to qualify for an award if they participate gainfully in the labor force while their case is being
decided (Autor et al., 2014). Knowledge of this fact may deter workers with residual work capacity from
applying for benefits since they would have to forfeit potential earnings in pursuit of an uncertain benefit.
Since, as we document below, many veterans did leave the labor force after becoming eligible for DC
benefits, it is plausible that a subset that would otherwise have been deterred from seeking SSDI benefits
would choose to pursue these benefits as an indirect consequence of the Agent Orange policy.37

36

Veterans receiving the IU rating are coded with a CDR of 100 since they receive benefits at the 100 percent
disability level.
37

Borghans et al (2014) find related evidence of program spillovers in disability receipt. On average, Dutch DI
recipients offset a €1.00 loss in DI benefits with a €0.30 increase in other social support programs. Duggan et al
(2007) find evidence that reductions in Social Security retirement benefits stemming from the rising U.S. Full
Retirement Age have lead to an increase in SSDI enrollment among cohorts facing a higher full retirement age.
20

To examine these potential spillovers, we estimate models analogous to equation (2) where the
outcome variable is the probability of SSDI receipt among BOG and NOG veterans (again measured at
the level of SSA reporting cells). Reflecting the longer sample window available for the SSA outcomes,
these models include two additional “pre” years, 1996 and 1997, and one additional “post” year, 2007.
Panel A of Table 7 shows that, like DC enrollment, SSDI receipt was trending upward faster among BOG
than NOG veterans by 0.13 percentage points per year prior to the 2001 policy change. But this trend
accelerated after 2001, increasing to 0.25 percentage points (0.13 + 0.12) annually. Notably, the
magnitude of the estimated effect on SSDI is only about 10 percent as large as the corresponding estimate
for DC enrollment (compare column 1, panel A of Tables 5 and 6).38 These results suggest that the Agent
Orange policy likely spurred additional SSDI enrollment, which may in turn have magnified any
reduction in labor force participation among eligible veterans.
In panel B of Table 7, we estimate models for receipt of SSI. Here, the estimates point in the opposite
direction: SSI enrollment was growing more rapidly among NOG than among BOG veterans prior to
2001, and this trend accelerated after 2001, in all likelihood because the additional DC transfer income
made some veterans ineligible for means-tested SSI benefits. The magnitude of the estimated break in
trend for SSI is only one-tenth as large as the corresponding estimate for SSDI, however.
The final panel of Table 7 estimates equation (2) for disability income combining benefits payments
from all three federal disability programs: DC, SSDI, and SSI. These estimates only include data from
1998 through 2006 since we do not have DC data for 1996, 1997, and 2007. Inclusion of SSDI and SSI
benefits with DC benefits raises the differential trend increase in benefits payments for BOG relative to
NOG veterans by approximately an additional 15 to 20 percent (compare to panel C of Table 6). Across
all veterans in our sample, combined disability benefits were rising by $128 annually among BOG
relative to NOG veterans prior to the 2002 Agent Orange policy change. Commencing in 2002, this
differential trend rose to $354 ($128 + $226). This average masks considerable heterogeneity. For

38

In estimates not displayed, we find impacts on SSDI receipt that are similar for the 1946-48 and 1949-51 cohorts.
21

veterans with high CDRs, DC benefits payments substantially exceed SSDI benefits for all but the highest
(pre-disability) earners; moreover, DC benefits are not subject to federal taxation. Thus, the bulk of the
impact of the Agent Orange policy on veterans’ transfer income accrues through the DC program.

V.   Consequences for Labor Force Participation
We now consider impacts of the Agent Orange policy on veterans’ employment and earnings. Using
models analogous (1) and (2), we test whether the fraction of BOG veterans in the labor force declined
differentially relative to NOG veterans following the 2001 policy change. We again include data from
1996, 1997, and 2007 because of the longer sample window available for SSA outcomes.
A.   Impacts on labor force participation
Table 8 considers the impact of the Agent Orange policy on labor force participation, measured as the
percentage of living veterans in an SSA reporting cell who have positive labor earnings. The first column
finds that labor force participation among BOG veterans in the baseline year of 1996 was slightly lower
(by 0.32 points) among BOG than NOG veterans. This participation gap was modestly expanding (i.e.,
becoming more negative) in the early part of our sample period, falling by an additional 0.81 points
between 1996 and 2001. This expansion accelerated after 2000, with the BOG relative to NOG labor
force participation rate falling by an additional 2.02 percentage points between 2001 and 2007. Column 2,
which fits the parameterized model in equation (2), shows the rate of divergence between BOG and NOG
veterans roughly doubled after the Agent Orange decision, from 0.15 percentage points per year to 0.33
percentage points (0.15 + 0.18) annually after 2001.
Coupled with the evidence in Table 5 on DC enrollments, the results in Table 8 suggest that the
differential increase in DC enrollment among BOG veterans spurred a reduction in their labor supply. A
natural alternative interpretation, however, is that BOG veterans were in worse health than NOG
veterans—perhaps due to the rigors of in-theatre military service—leading to comparatively earlier
retirements in the 2000s for reasons unrelated to the 2001 policy change. If so, the accelerating decline in
LFP among BOG veterans after 2001 should primarily impact the oldest Vietnam veterans, with younger
22

veteran cohorts exhibiting a similar LFP falloff as they approached these early retirement years in
subsequent years. Figure 7 and the remaining two panels of Table 8 explore these competing hypotheses
by again subdividing the sample into two birth cohorts of average ages 54 and 51 years at the time of the
policy change. Both the figure and the table reveal that labor force participation of BOG relative to NOG
veterans for both sets of birth cohorts dropped sharply soon after the policy change. The year-over-year
decline in BOG LFP relative to NOG LFP doubled after 2001 for both older (born 1946-48) and younger
(born 1949-1951) cohorts, rising from 0.17 to 0.36 percentage points (0.17 + 0.19) among the former
group, and from 0.14 to 0.32 percentage points (0.14 + 0.18) among the latter group. This trend break in
BOG relative to NOG labor force participation occurring simultaneously across birth cohorts after 2001
suggests that benefits expansion rather than early retirements explains the sharp drop in BOG labor force
participation following the Agent Orange decision.
The upper panel of Table 9 explores these employment patterns by race and AFQT subgroup.
Declines in LFP generally mirror uptake of DC across demographic groups. Consistent with the Table 6
findings for DC enrollment, the fall in labor force participation among nonwhite and among low-AFQT
BOG relative to NOG veterans following the 2001 policy change is more pronounced than among white
and higher-AFQT veterans. These differences across groups are not statistically significant, however.
B.   Impacts on labor market earnings
Alongside its extensive margin impact, receipt of DC benefits may spur veterans to reduce their work
hours or switch from full to part-time employment, thus reducing earnings conditional on ongoing
employment. We explore the effect of the Agent Orange policy on total labor force earnings by estimating
equation (2) for the log of mean cell earnings, excluding (of necessity) cells where all veterans have
exited the labor force.39 Panel B of Table 9 shows that earnings averaged about 2.6 log points lower

39

We use the log of the mean rather than the mean of the log because of the cell-level aggregation of our earnings
data. We do not, however, adjust cell means for non-participation; if a cell contains five veterans each earning $25K
annually and one leaves the labor force, mean cell earnings falls to $20K. Thus, this measure incorporates intensive
and extensive margin adjustments.
23

among BOG than NOG veterans in our baseline year, and this gap was expanding by about 0.2 log points
per year through 2001. The earnings gap grew significantly more rapidly—by about 0.7 log points
annually (0.23 + 0.45)—following the 2001 policy change. Once again, the effects are larger for nonwhite
and low-AFQT veterans.
Since these total earnings impacts combine extensive margin (participation) and intensive margin
(hours and wage) responses, we cannot directly infer whether they reflect changes in earnings among
incumbents or merely a reduction in the number of veterans working. The evidence in panel A of Table 9
suggests, however, that minority and low-AFQT veterans were particularly likely to exit the labor force
upon receiving DC benefits. If we hypothesize more generally that veterans with lower potential earnings
are most likely to exit the labor force in response to increased transfer income, we can compare extensive
margin and total earnings responses to assess evidence for intensive margin responses. Concretely,
suppose that earnings among those dropping out of the labor force are below the average of those still
working within the cell—that is, income effects are larger for low earnings workers. In this case, the
decline in log cell earnings will be smaller than the decline in log cell labor force participation.
Conversely, if the decline in log cell earnings exceeds the decline in log cell participation, this indicates
that either earnings is also falling on the intensive margin or, contrary to our assumption, higher earning
workers are exiting employment disproportionately.
To facilitate earnings and employment comparisons, panel C of Table 9 reports estimates where the
dependent variable is the log of the fraction of veterans in a cell working (rather than simply the
percentage working, as in panel A). Comparing across panels B and C reveals that the decline in relative
earnings of BOG versus NOG veterans after 2001 is, in most cases, slightly larger than the relative
decline in labor force participation. In column 1, for example, the relative decline in log earnings of BOG
relative to NOG veterans expands by 0.45 log points per year after 2001 whereas the relative decline in
log LFP increases by only 0.36 log points per year. This pattern also holds for black and white veterans
considered separately, though it does not hold for lower and higher-AFQT veterans. We infer that the
Agent Orange policy likely induced a mixture of labor force exit and earnings reductions among
24

beneficiaries, though the evidence on the latter margin is far from clear cut.

VI.   Comparing Labor Supply and Enrollment Impacts: Instrumental Variables Estimates
Motivated by the evidence that the Agent Orange policy both raised DC enrollment and lowered
earnings among eligible veterans, we now use the Agent Orange policy as an instrumental variable for
receipt of DC benefits. This instrumental variables approach provides a valid estimate of the causal effect
of DC benefits on labor supply under the assumption that the Agent Orange policy only affects
employment and earnings through its impact on benefits enrollment and transfer payments. This exclusion
restriction is untestable of course, but the panoply of findings above confer credibility: we find a sharp
rise in DC receipt, DC payments, and total disability income among BOG relative to NOG veterans
following adoption of the Agent Orange policy; the rise in take-up was equally steep and pronounced
among younger and older veterans, and was greatest among nonwhite and low-AFQT veterans; and in all
cases, take-up responses are paralleled by differential employment and earnings drops among BOG
relative to NOG veterans that occur among both older and younger veterans, and which are slightly more
pronounced among nonwhite and low-AFQT vets.
Table 10 presents instrumental variables of equation (2) for the impact of DC participation on labor
force participation, where the endogenous variable in panel A is the percentage of a cell enrolled in DC.40
The 2SLS estimate in column (1) finds that each percentage point increase in DC enrollment reduces the
fraction of veterans working by 0.18 points—that is, approximately one veteran exits the labor force for
every five veterans newly awarded DC benefits. Comparing across rows of this table, we find slightly
larger employment effects for nonwhite and low-AFQT veterans, consistent with our maintained
hypothesis that participation among these groups is more elastic. Notably, the (scaled) labor force
participation impact is estimated to be slightly (though not significantly) larger for younger than older

40

We limit the sample to the years 1998 through 2006 for which DC measures are available, rather than the longer
sample window of 1996 through 2007 for which SSA earnings data are available. The instrumental variable for DC
enrollment is 𝐵𝑂𝐺" × 𝑡 − 2001 ×1 𝑡 ≥ 2002 .
25

veterans, again underscoring that the results are unlikely to be simply driven by differential trends in early
retirement among BOG relative to NOG veterans.
By specifying DC participation as the endogenous variable, the panel A estimate does not account for
policy-induced increases in DC benefits along the intensive margin—higher benefits among incumbents,
and greater potential benefits among new enrollees. We relax this restriction in panel B by making our
endogenous variable the sum of disability income (DC, SSDI and SSI benefits). This variable captures
changes in transfer payments among both new enrollees and incumbents.41 The panel B estimates find
that each thousand dollars in disability benefits payment reduces the probability of a veteran working by
approximately 0.80 percentage points, with slightly larger impacts among nonwhite veterans (0.97 points)
and slightly smaller impacts among older veterans (0.70 points). Scaling these estimates by the mean rate
of labor force participation (84.7 points) and mean year 2000 earnings (in constant $2013 dollars) of
$52.5K (Appendix Table 4) implies an extensive margin labor force participation elasticity of -0.50. This
is similar in magnitude to the estimates reported by Boyle and Lahey (2010), who study the labor supply
of a relatively comparable set of veterans who were nearing retirement in the mid-1990s. We also cannot
rule out that the participation elasticity we obtain incorporates both pure (non-incentive) income effects
from increased transfer income and additional incentive effects stemming from the potential availability
of IU and SSDI benefits. Fully distinguishing these incentive and non-incentive effects remains a ripe
topic for future work.
To what degree is this causal effect driven by changes in labor force participation among incumbent
DC recipients—many of whom received a higher combined disability ratings and corresponding benefit
increases as a consequence of the Agent Orange policy—rather than by changes in participation among
new enrollees? Appendix Table 5 probes this question by comparing the evolution of CDRs among
veterans according to DC enrollment status as of 1998 (the earliest year for which we have enrollment

dollars rather than taking the logarithm.
26

data). Column 1 reports estimates of equation (2) for all veterans in our sample where the left hand side
variable is a veteran’s combined disability rating. Column 2 includes only veterans enrolled in the DC
program as of 1998, while column 3 excludes veterans not enrolled in DC as of 1998. Comparing the
column 2 and 3 estimates reveals that CDRs were increasing more rapidly among 1998 BOG incumbent
DC recipients than among their NOG counterparts prior to the policy change, but that there is only a
modest acceleration in this trend after 2001. Specifically, CDRs were increasing by about 0.8 percentage
points more annually among the BOG incumbents than the NOG incumbents between 1998 and 2001,
and this differential increased only modestly to 1.1 percentage points annually from 2002 forward (0.84 +
0.26). In contrast, the acceleration among new BOG entrants after 2001 (column 2) is much larger,
increasing from 0.20 to about 1.0 percentage points annually after 2001(0.22 + 0.73). Thus the Agent
Orange policy change generated a much larger impact on the DC status of BOG veterans who had not
already enrolled in DC prior to the policy change than it did on incumbent recipients, suggesting that
labor supply impacts are likely driven primarily by new DC entrants.
Panel B of Appendix Table 5 complements this evidence by comparing labor force participation
trends between cells with a high density of DC incumbents and those with a low density of DC
incumbents.42 Column 1 reports estimates of equation (2) for all veterans in our sample, while column 2
restricts our sample to cells where at least one third of veterans (“high density”) were enrolled in DC as of
1998 and column 3 restricts our sample to cells where less than one third of veterans (“low density”) were
enrolled in DC as of 1998.43 Following the 2001 policy change, the rate of divergence among BOG
relative to NOG veterans actually attenuated slightly for cells with a high density of incumbents (from
0.35 to 0.29 points per year), but nearly tripled for cells with a low density of incumbents (from 0.11 to

42

While the SSA outcome cells never combine BOG and NOG veterans, they often combine a mixture of DC and
non-DC enrollees, and this fraction changes over time as enrollment evolves. It would have been invalid to construct
cells based on eventual DC enrollment, of course, since DC enrollment is an outcome of the analysis.
43

We cannot fully distinguish labor force participation effects for incumbents and potential entrants because labor
force participation rates are determined at the cell level and cells are not stratified on DC enrollment. For example,
consider a cell with two veterans who were enrolled in DC as of 1998 and three veterans who were not enrolled as
of 1998. If all five veterans had positive earnings in 1998, but only four had positive earnings as of 2006, we are
unable to determine whether the veteran who dropped out of the labor force was enrolled in DC as of 1998 or not.
27

0.32 points per year). This pattern again suggests that the differential decline in labor force participation
among BOG relative to NOG veterans after 2001 is driven primarily by veterans induced to enroll in DC
by the Agent Orange policy rather than by policy-induced changes in behavior among incumbent
recipients.

VII.   Impacts on Total Earnings
Since the Agent Orange policy precipitated a rise in transfer payments and fall in employment and
earnings among eligible veterans, its net impact on incomes of BOG relative to NOG veterans is
ambiguous. We compare trends in total measured income (earnings plus the sum of DC, SSDI and SSI
benefits) between BOG and NOG veterans in Table 11, again limiting to the years 1998 through 2006,
where we have all earnings and benefits variables available. Since we have already established that
employment and earnings respond endogenously to policy-induced shifts in disability transfer income (as
theory would predict), the current exercise should be viewed as descriptive rather than inferential; the net
impact of the Agent Orange policy on veterans’ income combines exogenous policy impacts and
endogenous behavioral responses.
The first column of Table 11 (panel A) shows that, at the start of sample window in 1998, measured
incomes of BOG veterans were slightly lower than those of NOG veterans, with gaps of 0.75 log points
overall, 0.80 log points among nonwhites, and 0.70 log points among whites.44 Notably, incomes were
significantly higher (by 3.7 log points) among low-AFQT BOG veterans and significantly lower (by 2.5
log points) among high-AFQT BOG veterans (relative to their NOG counterparts). Recall, we saw earlier
in panel B of Table 9 that labor earnings of BOG veterans averaged up to 5 log points below that of NOG
veterans. Thus, comparing Tables 9 and 11 reveals that disability transfer income largely made up the
difference between BOG and NOG veterans, and resulted in substantially higher income for low-AFQT
BOG veterans relative to low-AFQT NOG veterans, consistent with the findings of Angrist et al (2010)

44

These reported earnings are covariate adjusted since they derive from the Table 11 regression estimates. Raw
differences are similar, however, as may be inferred from Table 3.
28

for low-education veterans.
The second and third rows of Table 11 summarize the evolution of the BOG/NOG income differential
before and after the Agent Orange policy. Prior to the policy change, BOG veterans were on a slightly
more positive total income trend than NOG veterans, with average annual incomes in the full sample
rising by 0.20 log points annually in relative terms. This differential trend steepened significantly
following the policy change, jumping from 0.20 to 0.71 log points (0.20 + 0.51) annually. For nonwhites
and low-AFQT veterans, the increase in the trajectory was steeper, rising from 0.27 to 1.31 log points
annually for the former group, and from 0.33 to 1.19 log points for the latter. While the Agent Orange
policy sharply reduced employment and earnings among eligible veterans, the Table 11 estimates make
clear that the policy-induced rise in transfer income more than offset these earnings reductions.
As a final characterization of these net policy and behavioral effects, the lower panel of Table 11
summarizes the net impact of DC enrollment on total earnings, where DC enrollment is instrumented with
the Agent Orange policy. The outcome variable for these estimates is cell total income—earnings plus
disability benefits—and the endogenous variable is again DC enrollment. The point estimate of 0.52 for
the full sample implies that - if a cell increased from 0 to 20 percent enrolled in DC - then average total
veteran income in the cell would increase by about 10.4 percent. In interpreting this sizable impact, note
that we found above that only one in five (18 percent of) newly enrolled veterans exited the labor force as
a consequence of the Agent Orange policy. For the remaining four-fifths, enrollment in DC raised transfer
income while generating only minimal offsetting reductions in labor income, thus unambiguously raising
total income. Of course, average incomes of Vietnam era veterans were modest in the early 2000s and
remained modest net of transfer benefits following the Agent Orange policy change. Nevertheless, this
policy had the unusual effect of increasing average veteran incomes, inclusive of the foregone earnings of
the approximately one in five newly enrolled DC recipients induced to exit the labor force.

VIII.  Discussion
This paper provides evidence that the policy-induced increase in enrollment in the VA’s Disability
29

Compensation program had a significant effect on the labor supply of Vietnam-era veterans. We estimate
that 18 percent of individuals who became eligible for the DC program as a result of the policy change
dropped out of the labor force. Analyses that explore the effect on average earnings support the
conclusion that DC enrollment substantially lowered labor supply among Vietnam-era veterans who
served in the Vietnam theatre during the conflict there. These effects appear to be driven by those made
newly eligible for DC benefits rather than by increases in benefits among those already receiving DC
prior to the 2001 policy change. The increase in transfer income more than offsets the reduction in
earnings, so that average income among BOG veterans increased relative to their counterparts who did
not serve in theatre. Combining policy-induced increases in transfer income and reductions in labor force
participation, we estimate an extensive margin labor supply elasticities of -.50, which is somewhat larger
than consensus estimates, though not implausible for this near-elderly population of Vietnam era veterans
in diminished health.
It is also likely that the income effect of DC income on employment and earnings is augmented by the
interaction between DC enrollment and veterans’ potential eligibility for Individual Unemployability and
SSDI benefits, both of which provide strong incentives against gainful labor force participation.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the Agent Orange decision affected enrollment in two other
federal disability programs, raising enrollment in SSDI by approximately one recipient for every ten
veterans newly enrolled in DC, and slightly reducing enrollment in the means-tested SSI program (though
the estimated effects are an order of magnitude smaller than for SSDI). In addition, 14 percent of Vietnam
era veterans within our sample received IU status by 2006. Among veterans who enrolled in DC the year
after the Agent Orange policy change, fully one-third received IU status or a CDR of 100 by 2006 . Since
IU benefits are only available to veterans with earnings at or below the poverty threshold for a single
individual, the rapid growth of IU designations among newly enrolled DC beneficiaries underscores the
potential for the graduated DC benefit program to generate unintended labor supply impacts. Analyzing
the dynamic interaction between these incentive and non-incentive effects of disability benefit programs
is a worthy goal for future research.

IX.   Data Appendix
A.   Construction of Cells in the BOG and NOG Samples
To construct cells for matching individuals in the BOG and NOG samples with SSA data, we group
individuals based on their values of certain background characteristics, including their gender, race, year
of birth, and so forth. The list of variables used to form cells, ranked in the order in which the grouping
occurred, is as follows:
1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  
5.  
6.  
7.  
8.  
9.  

Gender (male or female)
Race (white or nonwhite)
Death year (e.g. 1985)
Year-of-birth (e.g. 1946)
Start year (e.g. 1966)
Education at entry (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for hsd, hsg, smc, clg, clg-plus)
AFQT score quintile (e.g. 2)
Loss year (e.g. 1972)
Region of residence (e.g. Northeast)

Before forming cells, we determined which individuals could be verified upon matching to the SSA data.
A match would be verified if the social security number, date of birth, and at least six letters of the last
name could be matched in the two data sets. We construct cells from the verified BOG and NOG samples
so that there are between five and nine individuals in each cell. Each cell consists only of individuals in
the BOG or in the NOG. The number of variables used in the grouping varies across cells. This occurs
because in some cases, a cell reaches a size of five to nine after grouping on a relatively small number of
variables. If a cell is between 10 and 29 individuals, we do not split further, but instead split the cell into
the maximum number of cells with size five or more after sorting on the next matching variable to
maximize similarity within the cells. If a cell has fewer than five individuals then we re-merge it with an
adjacent cell. If a cell with fewer than five individuals is merged with an adjacent cell to form a new cell
with more than nine individuals, the merged cell is split in two.

B.   Construction of the Analysis Sample
Appendix Figure 1A diagrams the construction of the sample used in our analysis. The “loss year” file
and the Vietnam file combine to form our baseline OEMA sample of 4.1 million veterans. After merging
the OEMA sample to VA disability data, the SSA Death Master File, and SSA earnings information, we
restrict our sample to 3.8 million veterans who had valid SSA earnings data. As seen in Table 2, the
number of BOG veterans in our database is largest in the 1966 through 1971 start years; veterans who
began their service after 1971 tended not to serve in the Vietnam theatre while those entering before 1966
are much less likely to be included in our sample since many in the latter group left the Army prior to
1968, the first year of our “loss year” file. We therefore restrict both the BOG and NOG samples to
veterans who have a start year between 1966 and 1971 inclusive, which reduces our sample to 1.9 million
veterans.45 We further restrict attention to individuals born between 1946 and 1951 inclusive, with 1.5
million veterans remaining. We next exclude approximately 150,000 veterans who have missing loss
years, loss years before 1968, or loss years after 1985. We finally drop an additional 8,000 veterans who
are in SSA cells where not all veterans have the same birth year, at least one veteran in the cell has a start
year before 1966 or after 1971, or at least one veteran in the cell has a loss year before 1968 or after 1985.
Our final sample includes 1.351 million veterans of the U.S. Army who began their service between 1966
and 1971 and were born between 1946 and 1951. For the analysis, we converted this final sample into a
1996-2007 panel of 15.2 million (year) x (individual) observations, or 2.9 million (year) x (cell)
observations, as depicted in Appendix Figure 1B.46

45

For the nearly 200,000 veterans with missing start years, we imputed their start year based on the median start
year for other veterans in the sample with the same date of birth. This has little bearing on our final sample as nearly
all veterans with missing start years have missing loss years and are therefore excluded from our analysis.
46

A veteran who dies in year t is dropped from the analysis sample in year t and in all subsequent years. Because
year-of-death is one of the variables used when constructing cells, typically all members of a cell die in the same
year (if any die). The number of surviving cells falls by approximately 4.8 percent from 1996 to 2007. We restrict
our panel to 1998 through 2006 for all specifications where the outcome is based on VA disability data.

Notes: Panel A of this table reports the percentage of veterans in the BOG and NOG samples who were
enrolled in the DC program between 1998 and 2006. Panel B reports the mean monthly disability payments (in
$2013) for veterans who were enrolled in the DC program between 1998 and 2006. Panel C reports the
percenage of DC enrolled veterans who received compensation for diabetes. 1998 is not included in panel C
because our data include specific conditions for 1999 through 2006 only.

Notes: This table reports estimates of equations (1) and (2) where the dependent variable is the percentage of each cell
enrolled in the Disability Compensation program each year. Panel A includes all veterans in our sample and other
panels restrict the sample to veterans in the specified group. Each cell has one observation for each year between 1998
and 2006. All regressions include year fixed effects and fixed effects for each combationation of (AFQTquintile)x(year), (year of birth)x(year), and (race)x(year), where race is defined as white or nonwhite and veterans with
a missing AFQT score are grouped into a sixth AFQT category. All regressions weight each observation according to
the number of veterans in the cell. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

include year fixed effects and fixed effects for each combationation of (AFQT-quintile)x(year), (year of
birth)x(year), and (race)x(year), where race is defined as white or nonwhite. Column 1 includes all
veterans in our sample; all other columns restrict the sample to veterans in the specified group. Columns
1-3 group veterans with a missing AFQT score into a sixth AFQT category while columns 4-5 exclude
veterans with missing AFQT scores. In panel B, veterans with an IU rating are coded as having a
Combined Disability Rating (CDR) of 100. In panel C, mean annual DC payments are in $2013. All
regressions weight each observation according to the number of veterans in the cell. Standard errors are
reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Notes: This table reports 2SLS estimates of the effects of DC receipt on labor force participation (panel A) and annual disability benefits on
labor force participation (panel B). The instrument for all estimates is (BOG)x(year - 2001)x1(year ≥ 2002). All regressions include a main
effect for (BOG), a (BOG)x(year - 1998) time trend, year fixed effects, and fixed effects for each combationation of (AFQT-quintile)x(year),
(year of birth)x(year), and (race)x(year). Annual disability benefits are in $2013. Each cell has one observation for each year between 1998
and 2006 and all regressions weight each observation according to the number of veterans in the cell. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Notes: Panel A of this table reports estimates of equation (2) where the dependent variable is 100 times the log of
each cell's mean annual earnings and total disability income. Panel B reports 2SLS estimates of the effects of DC
receipt on the same outcome. The instrument in panel B is (BOG) x (year - 2001) x 1(year ≥ 2002) and the
endogenous variable is the percentage of the cell enrolled in DC. Each cell has one observation for each year
between 1998 and 2006, which are the years where DC information is available. Cells with 0 mean annual earnings
are excluded. Earnings and disability income values are in $2013. All regressions include year fixed effects and
fixed effects for each combationation of (AFQT-quintile)x(year), (year of birth)x(year), and (race)x(year), where
race is defined as white or nonwhite. Column 1 includes all veterans in our sample and columns 2-5 restrict the
sample to veterans in the specified group. Columns 1-3 group veterans with a missing AFQT score into a sixth
AFQT category while columns 4-5 exclude veterans with missing AFQT scores. All regressions weight each
observation according to the number of veterans in the cell. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, **,
and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Notes: This table reports estimates of equation (2) where the dependent variable is a veteran's Combined Disability
Rating (panel A), or the percentage of the veteran's cell with positive annual earnings (panel B). In panel A, column 1
includes all veterans in the sample, column 2 only includes veterans who initially enrolled in DC in 1998 or earlier,
and column 3 only includes vetearns who were not enrolled in DC as of 1998. Veterans with an IU award are given a
CDR of 100. In panel B, column 1 includes all cells, column 2 only includes cells where at least one third of veterans
in the cell were enrolled in DC as of 1998, and column 3 includes cells where fewer than one third of veterans in the
cell were enrolled in DC as of 1998. All regressions in panel A are at the individual level while regressions in panel
B are at the cell level and are weighted by the number of veterans in a cell in a particular year. All regressions
include year fixed effects and fixed effects for each combationation of (AFQT-quintile)x(year), (year of
birth)x(year), and (race)x(year), where race is defined as white or nonwhite and veterans with a missing AFQT score
are grouped into a sixth AFQT category. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
