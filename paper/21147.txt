Giving College Credit Where it is Due: Advanced Placement Exam Scores and College Outcomes

ABSTRACT
We implement a regression discontinuity design using the continuous raw Advanced Placement (AP)
exam scores, which are mapped into the observed 1-5 integer scores, for over 4.5 million students.
Earning higher AP integer scores positively impacts college completion and subsequent exam taking.
Specifically, attaining credit-granting integer scores increases the probability that a student will receive
a bachelor’s degree within four years by 1 to 2 percentage points per exam. We also find that receiving
a score of 3 over a 2 on junior year AP exams causes students to take between 0.06 and 0.14 more
AP exams senior year.

1. Introduction
Stagnant completion rates and increasing time-to-degree (Bound, Lovenheim, and Turner,
2010; 2012) in a time of high unemployment, budgetary crises, and increasing federal grant aid

(College Board, 2013a) have put colleges under increased public scrutiny. Inadequate
preparation for college is one factor behind the criticisms of college completion, but it is not the
only factor. Finishing a bachelor’s degree on time generally requires a student to complete at
least 120 credit hours within four years. To accomplish this, a student might take five courses per
semester, spread over eight semesters. Timely completion requires students to fulfill the coursespecific requirements of their chosen major, as well as any general education coursework
necessary for the awarding of a bachelor’s degree. For many students, neatly cobbling together a
postsecondary curriculum that satisfies both graduation and major requirements within 120 credit
hours is challenging. So difficult is this task that in 2011, 33 U.S. governors endorsed a report
authored by the Complete College America organization that identified excessive college course
taking as one of the five leading causes of the nation’s college completion crisis. 1
One potential way to ameliorate this problem is to give students the opportunity to earn
college credit while still in high school, which is typically accomplished either through dual
enrollment or Advanced Placement (AP) programs. 2 These widely accepted courses allow
students to earn credit and placement towards college graduation and to bypass introductory
courses while freeing up time to fulfill both major and general education requirements. 3 In
theory, students who take advantage of these colleges’ AP credit and placement policies may

required for such a degree. Time is the Enemy (2011). College Completion America. Retrieved from

Other solutions exist, including student facing solutions (e.g. better preparation and college match) and college
facing solutions (e.g. better professors, smaller classes, fewer requirements, and financial aid).

As of 2012, nearly four-fifths of four-year public and private not-for-profit colleges had AP credit policies in place
(IPEDS, 2012).

have an increased likelihood of completing college within a certain number of years after high
school graduation.
While taking an AP exam is a strong signal of academic ability, it is not a guarantee of
post-secondary academic success. About 16 percent of AP exam-takers do not attend four-year
postsecondary institutions and less than half (41 percent) complete bachelor’s degrees within
four years of high school graduation (see discussion of Table 1 below in Section 3). Thus, it is
plausible to conduct empirical analyses to study the effect of success on an AP exam on such
outcomes as completion of a bachelor’s degree within four (or five or six) years of high school
graduation. We believe that this paper is the first to identify the causal effect of receiving
college credit while in high school on such outcomes.
To evaluate the impact of early receipt of college credit, we exploit previously
unavailable data on the underlying AP exam continuous raw scores that map into the 1-5 integer
(scaled) scores, where a 5 is the highest possible score. 4 Availability of continuous data lend
themselves to a sharp regression discontinuity design whereby we compare nearly identical
students, as demonstrated with both density tests and covariate balancing tests, just above and
just below the thresholds of each scaled score as well just above and below the scores for which
students would receive credit at their chosen postsecondary institutions. The student just above
the threshold may receive the associated benefits resulting from earning a higher AP exam score,
which may include improved college admissions outcomes, advanced placement, credit,
completion, or even the psychological benefits of positive affirmation. We focus much of the
discussion of results on Biology, Calculus AB, English Language and Composition, English
Literature and Composition, U.S. Government and Politics, and U.S. History, the six largest

volume AP exams. These six exams encompass the four major high school curricular strands of
humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes the history of the Advanced
Placement program and results of past research on the effects of the program.

Section 3

describes our empirical hypotheses and the data we use to test them. Section 4 outlines the
framework for our empirical methodology. Section 5 presents empirical results. Section 6
concludes.

2. Background and Literature Review
The AP program dates back to the 1950s and was born partially to remedy “conspicuous
waste through unneeded repetition in the subjects of English (composition and literature),
history, sciences and foreign languages” (Lacy, 2010, p.28). Originally concentrated in well-todo high schools, the AP program underwent rapid expansion during the last quarter of the 20th
century, and by the mid 1990’s nearly half of U.S secondary schools offered AP coursework
(Lacy, 2010). By the 2009-10 academic year, 71 percent of all U.S. public high schools had
students participating in the AP program, and these schools enrolled 91 percent of public high
school students (Theokas and Saaris, 2013). AP participation rates have been steadily rising as
well, from more than 660,000 in the 2004 high school graduation cohort to approximately
940,000 for the 2009 cohort. 5 These AP participants tend to be academically stronger than the
typical college-aspiring students, with composite SAT (Math+Critical Reading) scores of
approximately 1136 on the Math and Critical Reading sections, which corresponds to 71st
percentile among the population of students from the 2004 thru 2009 cohorts who took the SAT.

5 These numbers include both private and public school students as well as international students.

The exact number of AP exams has varied over time, as some exams were retired due to
low participation rates and new exams were introduced as a result of high student demand. In
this research study, we consider 34 distinct subject exams, while focusing on the six most
popular (See Appendix 1 for details on exams).
2.1. Scoring
As previously discussed, AP exams are scored on an integer scale of 1-5, where a score
of 5 indicates that a student is “extremely well qualified” to receive college credit and a score of
3 suggests that the student is qualified to receive college credit. The minimum scaled score
required for college credit varies by college and by AP exam subject. Across the students who
take the six major exams, approximately 94 percent of the students attend a college that gives
credit for the exams and conditional on giving credit, approximately 58 percent of students
attend a college that require a 3, 38 percent require a 4, and 4 percent require a 5. 6
Underlying this scaled score is a continuous raw score which is a composite of the
student’s performance on both the multiple choice and free response sections of the AP exams.
This raw score is never observable to the student or college, and for a typical AP exam might
range from 0 to about 150, though the range of raw scores within a scale score varies across
subjects and also across years for a given subject.
2.2. Literature Review
A series of previous studies demonstrate a strong positive correlation between AP
participation, AP exam scores and subsequent academic performance across a range of measures
including college attendance (Chajewski, Mattern, and Shaw, 2012) and success in subject
performance (Patterson and Ewing, 2013), overall performance (Shaw, Mattern, and Marini,

policies are maintained at https://apscore.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement/search-credit-policies.

2012), and college completion (Morgan and Klaric, 2007; Dougherty, Mellor, and Jian, 2008;
Hargrove, Godin, and Dodd, 2008 ; Mattern, Marini and Shaw, 2013). 7 These studies show that
AP is a useful tool in identifying students who demonstrate potential for earning college
credit/placement. Though many of these studies convincingly demonstrate the predictive power
of AP exams, even after controlling for extensive sets of covariates, they do not estimate the
causal effects of taking an AP exam or achieving certain scores.
There have been some promising efforts to address the lingering causal research
questions.

For example, Jackson (2010) shows that students who are given cash to take and

perform well on AP exams are more likely to have higher SAT scores and matriculate in college.
While Jackson convincingly addresses the effect of AP course participation in Texas, he is
unable to disentangle the effects of achieving relatively higher AP exam scores beyond
traditional methods of controlling for observables. Similarly, other papers use a selection on
observables design but they note that any unobservable that is correlated with AP exam score
may confound the estimates (e.g. Murphy and Dodd, 2009; Long, Conger, and Iatorala, 2012). 8
Our paper is the first study to isolate the causal impacts of achieving certain benchmark AP exam
scores on student outcomes for those who have taken the exams.

3. Data, Descriptive Statistics, and Empirical Hypotheses
This paper uses student-level data from the 2004-09 graduating high school cohorts
collected from two main sources, College Board (CB) data on AP examinees and National
Student Clearinghouse (NSC) data. CB maintains a database of all students who take at least one
AP exam. This database contains not only the students’ AP exam scores on the 1-5 integer scale,
7

There is a similar line of research on dual enrollment. For example, see Karp et al. (2007).
There are currently some randomized AP evaluations underway, which will be very informative, but they are
limited in their scope of exams and populations (Conger, Long, and McGhee, 2014).

8

but their underlying continuous scores on most exams taken between 2004 and 2009. From these
two pieces of information, we identify the exact continuous scores that sharply form the
boundaries of the scaled scores. 9 In addition to student performance on each AP exam, the CB
data also contain a host of student demographic information, such as a student’s gender,
race/ethnicity, and parental income. 10
CB data are merged with the NSC data. As of 2014, over 3,600 postsecondary institutions
participate in NSC, which collects postsecondary enrollment information on more than 98
percent of students enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions. Data from the NSC allow us to
track a student’s postsecondary trajectory including enrollment and degree completion through
2013. Thus, we are able to track the 2009 cohort of high school graduates through up to four
years of college enrollment and to track earlier cohorts of high school graduates for at least five
years after high school graduation. As a simple measure of four-year college quality, we append
to our data the average standardized test scores (ACT and SAT) of incoming students reported to
the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). 11
Finally, we merge data on AP credit-granting policies to the colleges at which students
enroll. These data come from the College Board administered Annual Survey of Colleges (ASC),
which is administered annually to nearly 4,000 colleges. In the 2004 and 2005 surveys, the ASC
collected information on the minimum AP exam scores on 34 exams for which colleges award

9

Data on raw scores are available only for exams taken during the 2003-04 school year or later. Therefore some AP
test takers, particularly in the 2004 and 2005 cohorts, will not have raw scores that can be mapped to their scaled
scores. Any exam without an accompanying raw score is removed from our analyses,
10
Parental education and income are collected on the SAT registration forms, and so some AP test takers who did
not participate in the SAT will have missing demographic information. Even among SAT participants, some
students fail to respond to these questions.
11
To estimate average composite SAT scores, we add the 25th and 75th percentiles of the Math and Critical Reading
sections, as reported by IPEDS, and divide by 2. For colleges that only report ACT scores to IPEDS, we use an SAT
conversion table found at http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchnote-200940-act-sat-concordance-tables.pdf

credit. 12 Historically, college-level AP policies change very little from one year to the next. For
example, less than one-tenth of one percent of college-by-subject minimum scores differed
between the 2004 and 2005 surveys. Therefore, we match the 2005 college-level policies to
postsecondary institutions attended by the 2006-2009 high school graduation cohorts with the
data-informed assumption that any noise such matching introduces is likely to be minimal. 13
3.1 Summary Statistics
We present summary statistics on all students appearing in our sample in Table 1, as well
as students participating in the six most-represented AP exams in our sample. The first set of
columns show that females constitute the majority of AP examinees and that slightly less than
two-thirds of sampled students identified as white. Panel B of Table 1 shows the distribution of
AP exam scores among the sampled students. On average, the sampled students took 2.64 AP
exams for which we had the underlying raw scores and received 0.48 (18 percent) scores of 1;
0.59 (22 percent) scores of 2; 0.67 (25 percent) scores of 3; 0.53 (20 percent) scores of 4; and
0.37 (15 percent) scores of 5. Most - 84 percent - of these students ultimately attend a four-year
postsecondary institution and 41 percent obtained bachelor’s degrees within four years of high
school graduation.
Demographically, participants in the six most popular AP exams mirror the typical AP
examinee, an exception being Calculus AB where slightly more than half of participants are
male. Some of these APs exhibit sharp differences from each other in their scoring distributions.
For example, there is unusual variation in the scaled integer scores on the Calculus AP exam –
nearly half of students receive the lowest or highest scores of 1 and 5 (25 percent and 21 percent

12

There exists no data on minimum scores for Chinese, Italian Language and Culture, and Japanese Language and
Culture.
13
Among subjects for which survey respondents indicated minimum scores in both 2004 and 2005, there were
absolutely no reported changes in the credit-granting minimum scores.

of Calculus AB participants receive scores of 1 and 5 respectively) whereas only about one-sixth
of exam-takers receive these extreme scores on the English Literature exam (9 percent and 7
percent of English Literature participants). Academically, participants in these “major” subject
exams appear to be stronger than all AP exam-takers, with about 90 percent of participants
enrolling at a four-year college and 70 percent receiving bachelor’s degrees within six years of
high school completion.
3.2 Empirical Hypotheses
We use the summary statistics from Table 1 to direct our choice of empirical hypotheses
for this paper. As we describe in more detail in Section 4, our analysis is based on a regression
discontinuity approach, comparing students with raw scores just above and below the threshold
for scores in the 1 through 5 range on a given AP exam. We wish to focus on comparisons of
students with similar raw scores on a given exam, but where those just above a particular
threshold qualify for college credit and those just below that threshold do not qualify for college
credit.
Our first hypothesis is simply that students will be attracted to colleges that offer credit
for the particular scores that they achieve. Though students who take more than one exam may
face diluted incentives with regard to their score on a particular exam, this incentive would still
apply (to some degree) for each and every AP exam that they take.
(H1) Students will be more likely to attend colleges that provide credit for the AP
exam scores that they receive.
This hypothesis is also important to the econometric approach of our subsequent
analyses. If students systematically vary their choice of colleges based on the combination of
their AP exam scores and credit policies of colleges, then we would have to regard the choice of

college as endogenous. In this scenario, we might conflate effects from college quality with the
effects of receiving credit.
However, we also note that 11th grade AP exam-takers likely have much more ability to
adjust their college plans after learning their exam scores than do 12th grade AP exam-takers.
Most students who take an AP exam as high school seniors will have graduated from high
school, selected a four-year college and paid a deposit to that college by the time that they
receive their scores in the middle of the summer. At this time, it is too late to apply to additional
four-year colleges, for colleges to change admission decisions from the past spring, or for
students to enroll at a college after previously rejecting its offer of admission.
Since Table 1 indicates that completion of a bachelor’s degree (especially within four
years of high school graduation) is quite uncertain for this population of students, it seems
appropriate to focus on degree completion as an outcome of interest. Each AP credit that counts
towards requirements for college graduation may enable a student to reduce course load and still
graduate on time in four years. Hypothesis (H2) concerns this direct effect:
(H2) Achieving an AP exam score that counts for college credit promotes the
completion of post-secondary degrees.
Hypothesis (H2) is silent on the mechanism behind credit promoting completion. For
example, students may face a reduced course load or they may have the same course load, but a
different composition of courses.
There are several additional channels by which an increase in AP exam score could
promote postsecondary educational attainment. Each of these channels corresponds to a distinct
empirical hypothesis, which we enumerate below.

(H3) Achieving a relatively high AP exam score provides a psychological boost to
students and thus promotes their subsequent academic performance.
In recent years, it has become increasingly popular for students to take AP exams prior to
the senior year of high school. Success on an AP exam prior to the senior year can affect future
performance in several additional ways.
(H4) Achieving a relatively high AP exam score prior to the senior year of high
school may encourage students to continue taking advanced courses and AP exams
in subsequent years in high school.
One factor opposing hypothesis (H4) is that students typically select high school courses
in the late winter or early spring for the following school year. Once again, since this predates
the scoring of that year’s AP exams for junior exam-takers, it may not be feasible in all cases for
a student to change enrollment in AP courses for the next year after receiving AP exam scores
for the previous school year.
(H5) Achieving certain AP exam scores prior to the senior year of high school may
promote future enrollment at selective colleges.
(H5a) Achieving an AP exam score prior to the senior year of high school may
encourage students to adopt more ambitious strategies in the college application
process, thereby making them more likely to apply to more selective colleges than
they would have otherwise.
(H5b) Achieving an AP exam score prior to the senior year of high school may
improve the chances of admission to a particular selective college, conditional on
applying to that college.

Several of these hypotheses, and in particular (H5a), may be especially pertinent for lowincome students. Hoxby and Avery (2013) find that high achieving low-income high school
students are quite unlikely to apply to selective colleges. Further, Pallais (2013) concludes that
the application choices of low-income students are highly sensitive to small changes in the cost
of sending ACT scores to colleges. So it is natural to hypothesize that the college application
choices of talented low-income students may also be strongly influenced by a marginal change in
scaled score on a particular AP exam.
Hypotheses (H1) to (H5), which consider college choice, clearly overlap to some degree.
Fortunately, because we have information on (1) AP credit policies at each college; (2) AP exam
participation and scores for each student all through high school; (3) the set of colleges where
each student sends SAT scores; (4) college enrollment for each student by semester and year, we
can conduct a series of empirical tests that disentangle this overlap and enable us to evaluate
each hypothesis separately.
4. Empirical Methodology
We consider three distinct sets of outcomes in our empirical analysis as listed below:
•

College Completion Outcomes: 14
o Attains a Bachelor’s Degree in Four Years
o Attains a Bachelor’s Degree in Six Years

•

College Application and Enrollment Outcomes:
o Number of SAT Score Sends (proxy for application)
o Attends a Four-Year College First (on-time 15)

14

We include students who earn bachelor’s degrees through August four and six years beyond high school
graduation.
15
In this paper, we refer to on-time as beginning at a four-year college within 180 days of high school graduation.

o Mean SAT of First College Attended (four-year colleges only)
•

Subsequent AP Exam Taking and Performance for Junior Year AP exam-takers:
o Total AP Exams Taken Senior Year
o Total Scores of 3 or Higher Senior Year
o Total Scores of 4 or Higher Senior Year

While we believe that it is mechanically (nearly) impossible for the result of an AP exam
taken by a high school senior to influence that student’s choice of college applications and
enrollment choices for the following fall, we still perform analyses of these outcome variables to
verify that conjecture. However, since students do not take AP exams after graduating from high
school, our analysis for the third set of outcome variables – AP exam taking in subsequent
academic years – is limited to students who complete an AP exam in one year and then return to
high school the following year. Technically, we could perform analyses for AP exams results in
all grades prior to the senior year of high school, but since it is relatively rare for 9th and 10th
graders to take an AP exam, we limit our attention to the results of AP exams for high school
junior and seniors.
4.1. Unidimensional Framework
For our first set of analyses, we examine the effect of a marginal change in score on a
single AP exam on future outcomes. Each student i on AP exam j receives a continuous score
Cij. This continuous score maps into the scaled score, Tij as follows:



2

Tij = 3
4



1 if C ij < t 2j
if t 2j ≤ C ij < t 3j
if t 3j ≤ C ij < t 4j
if t 4j ≤ C ij < t 5j
5 if t 5j ≤ C ij

where t nj are the thresholds for each scaled score n on exam j. For each value of n ∈ {2,3,4,5},
we create two variables. The first is the forcing variable:

Dist ijn = C ij − t nj
which captures how far student i’s score on exam j is from threshold n. A Dist ijn ≥ 0 implies that
the student has a scaled scores of at least an n. This leads to the second variable for each value
of n, the dichotomous threshold variable:

1 if Dist ijn ≥ 0
Boundary ijn = 
0 if Dist ijn < 0
After generating these variables, our basic empirical framework is shown by the standard
regression discontinuity equation presented in equation (1), where Xij is a vector of fixed effects
for the student’s year of high school graduation and the high school year in which they
participated in AP exam j

Outcomeijn = a 0n + a 1n Boundaryijn + a 2n Dist ijn + a 3n Boundaryijn × Dist ijn + X ij + e ijn

(1)

We are primarily interested in the estimate of α 1n , which is the coefficient on Boundary ijn that
represents the discontinuous effect of being above the AP scaled n threshold on the outcome of
interest. In practice, we separately estimate the effects of each scaled threshold. We also define
the forcing variable to represent the distance between the student’s raw AP exam score in subject
j and the score above which the student would have been eligible to receive credit at her chosen
college.
The dependent variable in equation (1) is an indicator variable for the following
outcomes for each threshold n. In order to capture trends in the forcing variable that exist on

either side of the boundary, we fit a local linear regression with a triangular kernel. The
triangular kernel puts more weight on the observations closest to the threshold. In all regressions,
we estimate the optimal bandwidth using the method suggested by Imbens and Kalyanaram (IK)
(2012). 16
As with any regression discontinuity design, students just below an AP scaled threshold
are expected to have identical college and degree aspirations compared to students at or just
above the AP scaled threshold. Researchers who use test cut scores as forcing variables in
regression discontinuity designs often worry about score manipulation as a potential source of
bias (Schochet et al., 2010). Score manipulation might occur if students know exactly how many
questions they need to answer correctly in order to receive a certain score. Since students are
neither informed of how the exams are scored nor are they provided with their own raw scores,
manipulation would be impossible in this context. Nevertheless, we address and discount this
threat by showing that the density of scores is continuous in the vicinity of the thresholds through
density tests in the spirit of McCrary (2008). Second, we run covariate balancing tests with
similar specifications to equation (1), but using a covariate as the outcome. This allows us to
confirm that students just below the thresholds are observationally similar to students just above
the thresholds.
4.2.

Multidimensional Framework
The parameter estimate, α 1n ,, in equation (1) allows us to estimate the discontinuous

jump in the outcome measure from achieving one additional credit-granting AP exam score. For
the typical AP exam-taker, this parameter estimate likely understates the true impact of the AP
program. This is because more than 62 percent of AP exam-takers from the 2004 thru 2009 high
16

We test the sensitivity to bandwidth and kernel choices and find no measurable differences. These robustness
tests are presented in the appendix.

school graduation cohorts took more than one examination and 36 percent received a 3 or higher
on more than one examination. The unidimensional RD analytic framework fails to reveal the
impact of receiving two or more credit-granting AP exam scores on this paper’s outcomes, the
effects of which may or may not be additive. To explore the impacts of receiving multiple AP
credit-granting scores, we first adopt the analytic framework established by Papay, Murnane, and
Willett (2011) in which equation (1) is expanded to include multiple forcing variables,
boundaries and interactions as in the two-dimensional example shown by EQ(2). The sum of
parameters α1n , α 4n and α 8n in EQ(2) below represent the impact of receiving two additional creditgranting scores on tests J and K.

Outcomeijn = a 0n + a 1n Boundary iJn + a 2n Dist iJn + a 3n Boundary iJn × Dist iJn +
+ a 4n Boundary iKn + a 5n Dist iKn + a 6n Boundary iKn × Dist iKn + a 7n Dist iJn × Dist iKn +

a 8n BoundaryiJn × BoundaryiKn + a 9n BoundaryiJn × Dist iKn + a 10n BoundaryiKn × Dist iJn +
a 11n BoundaryiKn × Dist iJn × Dist iKn + a 12n BoundaryiJn × Dist iJn × Dist iKn +

(2)

a 13n BoundaryiJn × BoundaryiKn × Dist iJn + a 14n BoundaryiJn × BoundaryiKn × Dist iKn +
a 15n BoundaryiJn × BoundaryiKn × Dist iJn × Dist iKn + X ij + e ijn
Using pairings of the six most commonly taken AP exams in our data set, we fit equation
(2) to examine the impact of receiving two additional credit-granting scores on four, five and six
year bachelor’s degree completion rates.
4.3. Marginal Analyses
We conclude our analyses by estimating the impacts of receiving an additional creditgranting AP exam score on bachelor’s degree completion. The previously described analytic
strategies do not account for the fact that many sampled students will have taken and received
credit-granting scores on other AP exams. Equation 1 allows us to estimate the impact of
receiving a credit-granting score on AP Biology (for example), not the impact of only receiving a

credit-granting score in Biology and no other exams. Similarly, Equation 2 allows us to estimate
the impact of receiving an additional two credit-granting scores, not the impact of receiving only
two credit-granting scores.
It is possible that the first AP credit-granting score confers students with the largest
advantages in terms of bachelor’s degree completion and each additional credit-granting score
yields smaller marginal impacts. To test this, we modify equation (1) so that the forcing variable
indicates how close the student was to receiving X+1 credit-granting AP exam scores over X
credit-granting AP exam scores. For each marginal analysis, we restrict the sample only to those
students who received either X or X+1 credit-granting AP exam scores. We then re-define the
forcing variable as the minimum distance to 0 among all negative subject-specific distances to
the credit-granting threshold for students with X credit-granting AP exam scores and the
minimum distance to 0 among all positive subject-specific distances to the credit-granting
threshold for students with X+1 credit-granting AP exam scores. We continue to control for
cohort and subject-by-high school grade fixed effects.

5. Results
5.1. Density and Covariate Balancing Tests
To validate our regression discontinuity approach, we first verify that there are no
discontinuities in the density of student raw scores across each of the four scaled boundaries for
the AP subject exams that we study. In these density tests, we collapse observations into one raw
score point bins, by cohort and high school year in which exam was taken. Counts are then
regressed on distance from threshold, an indicator variable for whether the raw score is above the

specified threshold, an interaction of these two terms, and dummy variables for high school
graduation cohort and examination year.
In most RD settings, this type of density test might be performed to detect the presence of
score manipulation. However, since the AP scoring rubric is unpublicized, no students would
realistically be able to game the system in this manner.

An alternative source of density

discontinuity might originate from the placement of score boundaries, by the scorers, at points
along the raw score distribution that represent particularly sharp breaks in student ability. The
parameter estimates in Table 2 confirm that density is smooth across each of the four scaled
thresholds. None are statistically at the 0.05 level.
<<Insert Table 2>>

To test hypothesis (H1), about whether students choose colleges with AP credit policies
that favor them (given the AP exam scores they have achieved), we look for a discontinuity in
enrollment choices at each threshold in AP exam raw score. Figure 1 presents a histogram of the
differences between students’ raw AP exam scores and the colleges’ qualifying AP exam scores,
across all exams taken by on-time four-year college-going students for all AP exams (top panel)
and for exams taken during a student’s junior year (bottom panel), before which a college
decision has been formalized. Visually, no discontinuities exist, suggesting that students are not
sorting into colleges based on those colleges’ credit/placement policies.
Table 3 presents the results of tests for discontinuities in density of observations and
covariate imbalance at the college-policy thresholds for the six most popular AP exams. There
exists no clear evidence of discontinuity in the density of observations (Column 1) and the set of
covariates presented in this paper are generally well balanced across the thresholds (remaining
columns). This provides evidence against hypothesis (H1). That is, students are not choosing

their colleges based on the favorability of their credit-granting policies in relation to their AP
exam scores.
<<Insert Figure 1, Table 3>>
5.2 AP Exam Scores and Time to Bachelor’s Degree
As a precursor to our analysis of the individual hypotheses (H2) to (H5), we assess the
overall effect of an increase in AP exam score, in particular from just below to just above the
threshold for college credit. This formulation combines all of the different channels by which an
increase in AP exam scores influences the time to completing a BA degree.
Figure 2 presents the parameter estimates and t-statistics for regression discontinuity tests
for each of the 34 different AP exams for all students (high school juniors and seniors) and
completion of a BA degree within four, five and six years of high school graduation as
dependent variables. For each student, we compute the distance in raw score to the threshold
required for credit at the college where this student first enrolled after high school graduation. In
most cases, we use the distance to the 2/3 scaled score cutoff as the distance to the threshold, but
since the credit policies for each exam vary to some degree across colleges, we use different
scaled score cutoffs for some students. Here, we rely on the results of our earlier analysis of
(H1) to justify the use of this “distance to credit threshold” value as an independent variable in a
regression discontinuity specification, since that analysis indicates that students do not appear to
change colleges in response to a score just above or below a score threshold (i.e. near a value of
0 for the “Distance to Threshold” measure).
The top left panel of Figure 2 presents t-statistics and the top right panel of Figure 2
presents coefficient estimates for exams with completion of BA degree within four years of high
school graduation as the dependent variable.

The effect of meeting the college’s

credit/placement guidelines is estimated to be positive in 26 of 34 cases, typically with a
magnitude of an increase between one-half and one percentage point in probability of graduation
in four years. Since the sample sizes for most exams are quite large, we find that more than half
(14 of 26) of the positive coefficients, but none of the negative coefficients on achieving the
credit threshold are significant at the 0.05 level. When we restrict analysis to the 19 subjects
with more than 100,000 observations, we find that an even larger proportion of exams - 12 out of
19 – yield positive and statistically significant coefficient estimates.
The middle and bottom panels of Figure 2 show the results with BA degree completion
within five and six years, respectively, as the dependent variable.

These results provide

suggestive evidence that both the magnitudes and statistical significance of the parameter
estimates fade over time. That is, meeting the threshold for college credit on an AP exam
appears to reduce the expected time to completion of a BA degree, but also does not appear to
increase the long-run probability of completing a BA degree. This may reflect the difference in
baseline four-year and six-year graduation rates. Among students with AP exam scores just
below credit-granting thresholds, approximately 60 percent complete BA degrees within four
years of high school graduation, whereas more than 80 percent complete BA degrees within six
years of high school graduation. Since such a large percentage of these students complete BA
degrees within six years of high school graduation, the benefit of an additional AP exam credit
may have little influence on the long-run outcomes of those who would not otherwise complete a
BA degree within six years.
Tables 4 and 5 present the formal estimates for four- and six-year bachelor’s degree
completion rates corresponding to the most common exams in Figure 2. 17 As shown in the right
most column of Table 4, the effect of exceeding the credit threshold on four-year graduation is
17

Five-year graduation rates are presented in Appendix Table 3.

statistically significant at the .05 level for five of these six AP exams. By contrast, as shown in
the right most column of Table 5, the effect of exceeding the credit threshold on six-year
graduation is only statistically significant at the .05 level for two of these six exams. Further, on
an exam-by-exam basis, the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates are smaller for six-year
graduation than for four-year graduation.
Columns 1 and 4 of Tables 4 and 5 repeat these analyses for all students with raw scores
near the cutoff for scaled scores of 2 versus 3 and separately near the cutoff for scaled scores of 3
versus 4. 18 These coefficient estimates, especially those in Column 1 (for the 2/3 scaled score
cutoff) are broadly similar to the estimates for the “Distance to Cutoff” specification in Column
7 of Tables 4 and 5, suggesting that receiving higher AP exam scores improves time-to-degree.
<<Insert Tables 4,5>>
To distinguish hypotheses (H2) and (H3), which consider the direct effect of credit
receipt versus the psychological boost of a higher AP exam score, we compute separate analyses
at each scaled score threshold for (A) students attending colleges that use this threshold as the
minimum for college credit and (B) students attending colleges that do not use this threshold as
the minimum for college credit. As shown in Columns 2-3 and 5-6 of Table 4, we estimate that
receiving an AP exam score of a 3 over a 2 results in a statistically significant increase in the
probability of four-year bachelor’s degree completion of 1 to 2 percentage points, but only when
that score of 3 is high enough for the student to earn credit. Similarly, we find that achieving a
score of 4 over a 3 enhances the student’s probability of completing a bachelor’s degree in four
years only when 4 is the minimum credit-granting score. 19

18

Only students who enroll in four-year colleges as first-time on-time students are included in these analyses.
The obvious exception to this pattern is AP Biology, for which exceeding a certain AP threshold contributes to an
improved bachelor’s degree completion probability only when the threshold does not translate into a difference in
whether the student is eligible for college credit. It is not possible to explain this bewildering finding with the
19

To refine this assessment, we restrict the sample to high school seniors taking AP exams
and repeat these same specifications for four of the six popular exams studied in Table 4,
excluding English Composition and U.S. History, which are relatively rarely taken by high
school seniors. We note that high school seniors have already selected a college by the time that
they receive their scores, so should not be subject to the effects described in hypotheses (H1),
(H4) and (H5), which consider college choice.
Table 6 shows that we find positive and statistically significant effects (at the .10 level)
for three of the four subjects at the 2/3 scaled score cutoff and also at the 3/4 scaled score cutoff
for students attending colleges that use these separate cutoffs at the thresholds for college credit.
By contrast, we only find one statistically significant coefficient among the eight exams (four
exams at the 2/3 scaled score cutoff and four more exams at the 3/4 scaled score cutoff) for gains
in exam scores that do not correspond to a course credit threshold at the colleges where the
students enrolled. Taken together, these results weigh in favor of the direct effect of college
credit receipt in hypothesis (H2) over the psychological boosts associated with relatively higher
AP exam score in hypothesis (H3).
<<Insert Table 6>>
5.3 Impacts on Subsequent AP Exam Taking for High School Juniors
To test whether early success on AP exams encourages more advanced course work and
success, hypothesis (H4), we perform regression discontinuity tests for junior year exam-takers
using dependent variables based on senior year AP exam taking and scores. Since most AP
exam-takers will not have selected a college in their junior year, we use the same threshold –
either the 2/3 or 3/4 scaled score cutoff – regardless of the credit policies at the first college
existing data. However, in 2012, the College Board substantially re-designed the AP Biology exam, so it is possible
that the results presented in this paper will not be applicable to the more recent cohorts of AP Biology test takers.

where each student enrolled after high school graduation. Figure 3 graphs the average number of
senior year AP exams taken and the average number of scores of 3 or higher in senior year
exams by distance from the 2/3 threshold on each junior year exam. 20 We find discontinuities on
the order of about 0.10 senior year exams taken and 0.05 exams passed are present for all
subjects except for Calculus AB. But students who take the Calculus AB exam as juniors are
probably unusually accelerated, even within the population of those taking at least one AP exam
as a high school junior, and may have received sufficient academic affirmation in prior courses
that an additional signal of academic aptitude (in the form of an AP exam score) has little effect
on them.
Table 7 presents numerical estimates of the marginal effect of an increase scaled junior
year AP exam score on each of the six most popular AP exams on senior year AP exam taking
and performance. Consistent with the results of Figure 3, we find that an increase in scaled score
from 2 to 3 increases the number of AP exams taken in the senior year; these predicted increases
are statistically significant at the 5% level for five of the six exams and at the 10% level for the
remaining exam, Calculus AB.

Across the other boundaries, there exist some positive,

statistically significant increases in senior year AP exam taking. These provide suggestive
evidence that even receiving a signal that a student is “possibly qualified” (AP exam score=2)
rather than “no recommendation” (AP exam score=1) induces an increase in senior year AP
exam taking.
<<Figure 3, Insert Table 7>>
These results provide support for hypothesis (H4).

Yet, a back of the envelope

calculation suggests that while success on an AP exam as a high school junior is predicted to
induce additional AP exam participation as a high school senior, this additional exam taking as a
20

We cannot observe AP course taking, only exam taking.

senior is likely to have only a second-order effect on post-secondary success. For example,
Table 7 suggests that an increase in scaled score from 2 to 3 increases the number of scores of 3
or higher on senior year exams by at most 0.09. But since the estimates from Tables 4 and 6
suggest that each additional score of 3 or higher as a high school senior increases the probability
of on-time completion of a BA degree by about 1 to 2 percentage points, an increase of 0.09 AP
credit-granting scores would translate into an extremely small effect on time to completion of a
BA degree.
5.4 Score-Sending and College Choice
To test hypotheses (H5a) and (H5b), which consider college application and admission,
we first assess the effects of achieving certain AP exam scores on the student’s college search
process and whether or not the student enrolls at a four-year college on-time. We rely on the
number of SAT Score Sends as a proxy for number of applications. A discontinuity in this metric
would strongly suggest that achieving certain AP exam scores alters the number of college
applications submitted. Since high school seniors send SAT scores to colleges before they take
AP exams, estimates for exams taken senior year serve as placebo tests for junior year estimates.
The first six columns of Table 8 show that achieving a score of 3 over 2 or a score of 4
over 3 on AP exams taken during a student’s junior year of high school tend not to impact SAT
score sending. Among the 12 parameter estimates presented for junior year SAT test takers, only
one (English Language and Composition at the 2/3 boundary) is statistically significant. The
magnitude of this parameter estimate indicates that receiving a score of 3 on AP English
Language and Composition causes the student to send 0.10 (2.5 percent) more scores to colleges.
As expected, almost all (11 out of 12) placebo tests using SAT score sends of high school senior
AP exam-takers are statistically indistinguishable from zero. In Appendix Table 8, we show little

heterogeneity along the lines of parental income in shifting college application behavior as a
result of achieving scores of 3 or 4.
In the last six columns of Table 8, we present regression discontinuity parameter estimate
of the average SAT scores of colleges selected by first-time on-time four-year college enrollees.
Restricting analyses to AP exam scores on the six most popular AP exams for high school
juniors, we find only one statistically significant (positive) effect at the 2/3 scaled score cutoff
and one statistically significant (positive) effect at the 3/4 scaled score cutoff. Similarly, in
unreported analysis, we find essentially no effect of AP exam scores on enrollment in four-year
colleges. This is most likely because the baseline four-year college-going rates among students
participating in AP exams is already quite high.
Overall, these results do not support hypotheses (H5a) or (H5b) in that there are no
measurable changes in students’ Score Sends or attending college after achieving a relatively
high AP exam score.
<<Insert Table 8>>
5.5 Multidimensional RD Impacts
In Figure 4, we show the distribution of point estimates associated with achieving creditgranting scores on the 15 pairings of the six commonly taken AP exams. These pairings include
all possible two-exam combinations of the six AP exams in Tables 4 and 5. The pattern is clear.
When the outcome of interest is bachelor’s degree completion in four years (Panels A and B), the
parameter estimates are mostly positive. In fact, at a bandwidth of 20, only one of the 15
multidimensional parameter estimates in Panel B is negative, and the magnitude of this one
parameter estimate is only -0.4 pp. Expanding the time to bachelor’s degree completion from

four years to six years results in a more equally distributed number of positive and negative
parameter estimates (Panels E and F).
On average, the magnitudes of the four-year bachelor’s completion parameter estimates
in Panels A and B are about twice as large as the unidimensional point estimates presented in
Table 4. When observations are restricted only to those within 10 raw points of the creditgranting boundary, the average impact of receiving an additional two credit-granting scores
across all 15 pairings is 3.2 percentage points. When the bandwidth is expanded to +/- 20 raw
points, the average impact on four-year bachelor’s completion is 2.7 percentage points.
<<Insert Figure 4>>
Despite the fact that, in the unidimensional RD framework, we were unable to detect a
boost in four-year bachelor’s degree completion from receiving a credit-granting score in AP
Biology, our analysis in the multidimensional RD framework suggests that when paired with
other AP examinations, success on AP Biology substantially increases four-year bachelor’s
completion rates. In fact, some of the largest estimates shown in the histogram Figure 4 (panels
A and B) are for AP Biology pairings. When the bandwidth is +/-10 raw points, receiving/ a
credit-granting score on AP Biology and AP US Government, AP Biology and AP English
Language and Composition and AP Biology and AP US History increases the probability of
receiving a bachelor’s degree in four years by 9.4 pp, 8.0 pp and 5.0 pp respectively. The
corresponding percentages when the bandwidth is expanded to +/- 20 raw points are 2.5 pp, 5.1
pp and 4.0 pp. Also notable is the pairing of Calculus AB and English Language and
Composition, credit eligibility on both of which leads to the largest point estimates on four-year
bachelor’s degree completion for both bandwidths among all 15 pairings (10.1 pp at a bandwidth
of +/- 10 raw points and 5.4 pp at a bandwidth of +/-20 raw points).

5.6 Marginal Impacts
In this section of results, we address whether the impact of receiving an additional creditgranting AP exam score on bachelor’s degree completion and time to completion depends on the
number of credit-granting scores that the student had already amassed. These analyses differ
from all previous analyses in that we do not discern between the 34 AP subjects for which we
have college-specific AP credit-granting score minima. Table 9 shows the impact of bachelor’s
degree completion probability driven by each incremental increase in the number of creditgranting AP exam scores earned. Students who have met the credit-granting threshold on just
one AP exam are 1.2 percentage points more likely to have earned a bachelor’s degree within
four years than students who just missed earning a credit-granting AP exam score. Transitioning
from one credit-granting AP exam score to two results in an additional 0.8 percentage point
boost in four-year bachelor’s degree completion. Progression from four to five credit-granting
AP exam scores yields increases in four-year and six-year bachelor’s degree completion
probabilities of 1.2 and 0.9 percentage points, respectively.
<<Insert Table 9>>
Parameter estimates in Table 9 can be used to draw inferences about the cumulative
impacts of achieving credit-granting scores on AP exams. For example, the parameter estimates
in Column 1 suggest that students who earn credit-granting scores on two AP exams could
experience a 2.0 percentage point bump in four-year bachelor’s degree completion probability
attributable to those credit-granting scores. This 2.0 percentage point bump is calculated as the
sum of the first two parameter estimates (1.2 and 0.8 percentage points) in Column 1 and is
roughly equal to the multidimensional estimates on the passing of two AP exams presented in
Section 5.5. The consistently positive, though imprecisely estimated, parameter estimates in

Column 1 reveal that the marginal benefits of earning additional credit-granting AP exam scores
continues to increase four-year bachelor’s degree completion rates beyond the first two passing
scores. Addition of the first five parameter estimates in Column 1 suggests that one college
semester’s worth of AP credits may increase four-year bachelor’s degree completion rates by
nearly 4 percentage points.
5.7 Heterogeneous Effects
We hypothesized that the effects of AP exam scores on college choices and college
completion might be unusually pronounced for students from low-income families. To test this
hypothesis, we repeat the analysis from Tables 4 and 5 for subgroups of students based on selfreported family income. The results, as shown in Table 10, are consistent with the earlier
findings, which suggest that AP credit-granting policies have an effect on four-year bachelor’s
degree completion rates, but much less, if any effect, upon six-year bachelor degree completion
rates. However, we see no obvious patterns across family income in RD estimates for four-year
and six-year completion of bachelor’s degrees. Since our measure of family income is based on
student self-report, which is likely to be fairly noisy, we do not regard the coefficients in Table
10 as precise estimates of heterogeneous effects as a function of family income. Nevertheless, if
the effects of AP credit policies are concentrated in students from families with relatively low
incomes, we would still expect to see conspicuous patterns by income in Table 10. Since this is
not the case, we tentatively rule out the hypothesis that AP credit is unusually important for
students from low-income families.
<<Insert Table 10>>
We also test for heterogeneous effects by race and parental income and also find no
obvious differences. Results are reported in Appendix 7.

6. Discussion and Conclusion
In this study, we find evidence that attaining a relatively high AP exam score yields a
significant increase in the probability of completing a bachelor’s degree within four years of high
school graduation. For high school seniors, we attribute most of this effect to the direct effect of
an AP credit towards college graduation requirements (empirical hypothesis (H2)), since we find
little to no effect on bachelor's degree completion from an increase in AP exam scores for high
school seniors when those increases in scores are not at the credit/no-credit boundary at the
college attended by that student. Thus we rule out empirical hypothesis (H3), which suggests
that a marginal increase in AP exam score improves post-secondary outcomes by providing a
psychological boost to students.
We also find evidence that earning scores of 3 or higher on AP exams for high school
juniors induces increased participation and success on AP exams (empirical hypothesis (H4)) in
the senior year of high school. However, this increase is still of relatively small magnitude – e.g.
an improvement in AP exam score from 2 to 3 or 3 to 4 predicts an increase of approximately 0.1
additional AP exams taken as a high school senior – and is only predicted to produce secondorder effects on time to bachelor’s degree completion. While students with higher AP exam
scores tend to enroll in more selective four-year colleges, we find little causal evidence that the
AP exam scores themselves radically shift whether or not a student enrolls at a four-year college
or the type of college chosen, as measured by average college-level SAT scores (empirical
hypothesis (H1) and (H5)). In particular, it does not appear that an increase in AP exam score
for a high school junior alters the colleges to which she sends SAT scores. Given this pattern of
results, we also attribute the significant increase in the probability of completing a bachelor’s
degree within four years of high school graduation that we observe for high school juniors to the

direct effect of an AP credit towards college graduation requirements (empirical hypothesis
(H2)).
One unique result that we did not previously highlight is that our estimates on the effect
of credit on four-year graduation rates are similar on the 2/3 boundary and the 3/4 boundary.
Typically in a regression discontinuity design, researchers have one discontinuity to exploit and
the estimated treatment effect is localized. In this analysis, there is evidence that the treatment
effect is constant, at least on the 3 to 4 range.
We believe that these findings have positive implications for colleges and students. From
the perspective of postsecondary institutions, awarding AP credit and/or placement may serve as
a useful tool for increasing the percentage of students who complete bachelor’s degrees in four
years. By awarding college credit and advanced placement to successful AP examinees,
postsecondary institutions can free students from unnecessary curricular repetition while
simultaneously responding to the issues of overcrowding of introductory courses in the nation’s
larger university systems (Moltz, 2009; Murphy, 2013). 21
For students, AP exams can reduce the total costs associated with a postsecondary
education. During the 2013-2014 academic year, the typical student attending a four-year public
college faced tuition and fees of $8,893 (Baum and Ma, 2013). Assuming that a typical student
completes 30 credits per year, savings from earning credit on one AP exam has the potential to
save that student an estimated $889 in costs for colleges that charge tuition per credit. 22 Further,
our finding that each AP course credit increases the probability of completing a bachelor’s
degree on-time in four years from high school graduation translates into additional expected

21

Evans (2013) explores this question using a selection on observables identification strategy.
We assume that the student is awarded 3 credits for a passing score and pricing is linear with respect to credits.
Depending on the AP exam and the institution, the student might actually receive more than 3 credits for a passing
score, meaning that the $889 figure probably represents an underestimate.
22

financial benefits due to (1) reduced tuition costs at colleges that charge by semester rather than
by credit and (2) increased wages and career benefits due to potential earlier entry into the labor
market.
A final and important note is that the estimates in this paper represent a lower-bound on
the total effects of the AP program. Some students with the potential to benefit from sharing AP
exam results with their chosen colleges may have instead withheld these scores or colleges may
have additional restrictions on the credit policies (e.g. maximum number of AP credits). This
behavior would understate our estimated effects on bachelor’s degree completion. Similarly, we
are unable to offer any commentary on the cumulative effects of taking an AP course and earning
credit on the associated AP exam. Because our estimation strategy relies on the comparison of
two sets of students- those who barely achieved a credit-granting score and those who barely
missed a credit-granting score-, we are unable to determine how the content of the AP course
influences bachelor’s degree completion, which is necessary to fully determine the costs and
benefits of the AP program.

Notes: The unit of observation is a student. Means and standard deviations are calculated using the raw AP scores. Because raw AP score data were unavailable before 2004, some sampled
students, particularly for earlier high school graduation cohorts, will have participated in more AP exams than their raw scores would suggest.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, ***
p<.01). All regressions use triangular kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high
school year in which exam was taken. In these density tests, observations are
collapsed into 1 raw score point bins, by cohort and high school year in which exam
was taken. These counts are then regressed on distance from threshold, an indicator
variable for whether the raw score is above the specified threshold, an interaction of
these two terms, and dummy variables for high school graduation cohort and
examination year. The means below the thresholds represent the mean number of
observations within the high school cohort by exam year categories within 1 raw
score point below the specified threshold . Optimal bandwidths are selected using the
outcome, bachelor's degree within four years.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, *** p<.01). Only includes students who enrolled in four-year colleges on-time (within
180 days of HS graduation). All regressions use triangular kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high school year in which exam was taken. In the density tests
peformed in Column 1, observations are collapsed into 1 raw score point bins, by cohort and high school year in which exam was taken. These counts are then regressed
on distance from threshold, an indicator variable for whether the raw score is above the specified threshold, an interaction of these two terms, and dummy variables for
high school graduation cohort and examination year. The means below the thresholds represent the mean covariate values within 1 point of the boundary. Optimal
bandwidths are selected using the outcome, bachelor's degree within four years.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, *** p<.01). Includes AP exams taken by the
2004-2009 cohorts. All regressions use triangular kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high school year in which exam was
taken. Means represent the average value of the outcome within 1 raw point of the cut score. All students in sample first
attended a four-year college within 180 days of HS graduation. Bachelor's outcomes include students who received bachelor's
degrees from four-year colleges within four years of graduating from high school. Only students with raw scores indicating
scores of 2 and 3 included in 2/3 threshold analyses, and only students with raw scores indicating a 3 and 4 included in the 3/4
threshold analyses.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, *** p<.01). Includes AP exams taken by the 2004-2009 cohorts. All regressions use triangular
kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high school year in which exam was taken. Means represent the average value of the outcome within 1 raw point of the cut score. Only
students with raw scores indicating scores of 2 and 3 included in 2/3 threshold analyses, and only students with raw scores indicating a 3 and 4 included in the 3/4 threshold
analyses.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, *** p<.01). Includes AP exams taken
by the 2004-2009 cohorts. All regressions use triangular kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high school year by
subject. Means represent the average value of the outcome within 1 raw point of the cut score. Sample only includes
students who began at four-year institutions with AP credit policies within 180 days of HS graduation, and students for
whom all integer AP exam scores were matched to raw AP scores.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, *** p<.01). Only includes
students who enrolled in four-year colleges on-time (within 180 days of HS graduation). All regressions use
triangular kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high school year in which exam was taken. The forcing
variable in these regressions is the distance from the credit-granting threshold. The means below the
thresholds represent the mean covariate values within 1 point of the boundary.

Notes: Includes AP exams taken by the 2004-2009 cohorts. On-time students are those who began at a four-year college within 180 days of HS
graduation. In very rare instances, colleges indicated awarding credit for scores of 1. These cases are eliminated from our analyses.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, *** p<.01). Only includes students who enrolled in four-year
colleges on-time (within 180 days of HS graduation). All regressions use triangular kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high school year in
which exam was taken. The forcing variable in these regressions is the distance from the credit-granting threshold. The means below the thresholds
represent the mean covariate values within 1 point of the boundary.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses (*p<.10, **p<.05, *** p<.01). All regressions
use triangular kernels with fixed effects for cohort and high school year in which exam was taken. The
forcing variable in these regressions is the distance from the credit-granting threshold. The means below the
thresholds represent the mean covariate values within 1 point of the boundary. Only students with raw
scores indicating scores of 2 and 3 included in 2/3 threshold analyses, and only students with raw scores
indicating a 3 and 4 included in the 3/4 threshold analyses.
