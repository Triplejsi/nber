Does Exporting Improve Matching? Evidence from French Employer-Employee Data

ABSTRACT
Does opening a market to international trade affect the pattern of matching between firms and workers?
And does the modified sorting pattern affect welfare? This paper answers these questions both theoretically
and empirically in three parts. We set up a model of matching between heterogeneous workers and
firms where variation in the worker type at the firm level exists in equilibrium only because of the
presence of search costs. When firms gain access to the foreign market their revenue potential increases.
When stakes are high, matching with the right worker becomes particularly important because deviations
from the ideal match quickly reduce the value of the relationship. Hence exporting firms select sets
of workers that are less dispersed relative to the average. We then document a novel fact about the
hiring decisions of exporting firms versus non-exporting firms in a French matched employer-employee
dataset. We find that exporting firms feature a lower type dispersion in the pool of workers they hire.
The matching between exporting firms and workers is even tighter in sectors characterized by better
exporting opportunities as measured by foreign demand or tariff shocks. In a calibrated general equilibrium
version of the model we show that trade opening increases welfare by more when search costs are
high, pointing to an additional source of gains from trade.

Introduction

The pattern of sorting of workers across firms has fundamental implications for the efficiency of the
economy as well as for the inequality of wages in the labor force. The first implication has been a
concern of the literature on assignment starting from Shapley & Shubik (1971) and Becker (1973).
From those contributions we know that when firms and workers are complementary in production,
then the allocation of the right worker to the right job maximizes output. The second implication
has received attention more recently for example by Card et al. (2013), who show that sorting of
good workers to good firms can explain as much as 35% of the recent increase in wage inequality in
West Germany. The logic by which highly skilled workers are paid more not only because of their
innate higher productivity, but also because they work with highly productive firms and co-workers,
is common to the contribution by Kremer & Maskin (1996) as well.
In this paper we start from the premise that the optimal allocation of workers cannot be reached
because of the presence of search costs, and therefore firms accept some degree of mismatch in
equilibrium because the cost of search exceeds the benefit from a more suited partner. We then
explore whether the matching of firms and workers is affected by access of the former to the
export market. But how can market integration affect how firms and workers are matched? When
firms gain access to the foreign market their revenue potential increases. When stakes are high,
matching with the right worker becomes particularly important because deviations from the ideal
match quickly reduce the value of the relationship.
Using matched employer-employee data from France, we show that exporters select pools of
workers characterized by a higher average type and, more importantly, a lower type dispersion
than non-exporting firms. While the first effect is predicted by other models (Helpman et al., 2010
and Sampson, 2012) we believe we offer a novel way of testing this prediction, which disentangles
pure exporter wage premia (deriving from profit-sharing with workers as in Amiti & Cameron,
2

2012) from the selection of better workers by exporting firms. The second effect, i.e. the influence
of exporting on worker type dispersion, is unexplored in the literature and is quantitatively as
strong as the effect of exporting on worker average type. We explore further the effect of exporting
by building measures of the exporting opportunities in different sectors using tariffs and aggregate
imports from the rest of the world of the various countries that France exports to. Whether we build
these measures at the firm or at the sector level (using previous period export shares), we find that
when exporters face lower tariffs or larger demand for imports in a foreign market, the dispersion
of types in their pool of workers declines further. We believe this result is harder to reconcile with
a view that the exporting and tightening of the matching are both driven by a common excluded
factor.
To study the impact of exporting on matching we employ the model proposed by Eeckhout
& Kircher (2011), where we show that exporting is identical to an increase in the firm’s type.
Heterogeneous workers and firms face a dynamic problem where in the first period they meet at
random and decide whether to accept the match or not. If they do not accept the match they
pay a search cost and proceed to the second period where perfect assortative matching prevails.
The second period, rather than an infinite horizon, approximates the long-run outside option for
both worker and firm. The presence of search costs creates an acceptance set, rather than a unique
assignment outcome that prevails in the frictionless model. As shown by Eeckhout & Kircher
(2011), the boundaries of such acceptance set are increasing in firm type, confirming the pattern
of positive assortative matching in a model with frictions. We focus on a different dimension and
we take the width of the acceptance set as a measure of the variability in worker type tolerated by
the firm.
On the one hand, because of complementarity, a worker with type below the firm’s ideal creates
a reduction in output that is larger when the firm is very productive. On the other hand a worker

3

type that is above the average type requires an increasing compensation due to her outside option.
Such compensation rises much faster at firms that are more productive because they employ on
average more productive types. The result is that firms that are more productive, or that have
access to the export market, tolerate less relative dispersion from their ideal worker type.
In order to assess the welfare implications of this novel empirical finding, we present two sets
of results. First, we derive a measure of the average revenue deviation for each firm type relative
to the optimum assignment. We show that, according to this measure, a more productive firm
(or an exporting firm) features a lower deviation from the optimal level of revenues created under
perfect assortative matching. This is only a partial equilibrium result and cannot inform us as to
whether there are overall gains from trade opening related to this matching channel. In particular
there are two counteracting forces when an economy is opened to trade. On the one hand, importcompeting firms receive a negative shock to their revenues and therefore their matching range tends
to widen. On the other hand, exporting firms receive a positive shock and choose smaller deviations
from the optimal. We therefore proceed to simulate an infinite horizon version of the model with
two symmetric countries and calibrate it to French moments of the data in order to recover the
parameters for costs of search, transport costs and elasticity of demand. We numerically show
that the gains from trade are larger as we increase the cost of search. We interpret this result
as providing support to the idea that when an economy is characterized by high frictions, trade
opening can be more beneficial than when the economy is essentially very close to the optimal
worker and firm allocation. This explicit result on welfare is novel in the literature and we believe
could be further explored in a richer model.
This paper contributes to the growing literature on international trade with heterogeneous
workers and firms, which is surveyed in a recent chapter by Davidson & Sly (2012). More specifically
it belongs to a strand of research that investigates the effect of openness on the process of matching

4

between firms and workers, which is at the core contribution by Sampson (2012), who studies its
consequences for wage inequality.1
The most closely related work is a recent paper by Davidson et al. (2012), which shows,
using Swedish data, that export-oriented sectors display a higher correlation between firm and
worker types, estimated as firms’ and workers’ fixed effects in a wage regression as in Abowd et al.
(1999)(henceforth AKM).
Our approach shifts the focus on the firm-level decision rather than looking at the aggregate
strength of matching and therefore relies on a different type of variation to detect different matching
behaviour by firms that are differentially exposed to international trade. In particular, it exploits
within-sector variation between exporting and non-exporting firms, therefore isolating and controlling for other sector-level characteristics of the labor market that may affect the sorting of workers
across firms.
Moreover, because Eeckhout & Kircher (2011) prove that firms fixed effect deriving from a wage
regression a la AKM might be negatively or not correlated with the true firm type, we are careful to
avoid using those fixed effects as a proxy for the firm’s type. We use instead variables constructed
from firm-level data, such as sales, value added and total employment.
From a theoretical standpoint our approach differs from Davidson et al. (2008) in that we
have a different focus. We are interested in deriving predictions at the firm level, rather than at
the aggregate level and therefore we allow for a rich heterogeneity on both the worker and the
firm side. Davidson et al. (2008) simplify those dimensions in order to obtain clean aggregate
results. In particular they have high and low types of workers and high and low technology which
is chosen endogenously by ex-ante homogeneous firms. Globalization can take the economy from
an equilibrium in which high-tech firms employ high type workers and low-tech firms employ both
1

Our paper is also related to the large literature on the impact of trade on inequality, which includes, among many
others, Feenstra & Hanson (1999), Costinot & Vogel (2010), Bustos (2012), Amiti & Cameron (2012), Verhoogen
(2008), Krishna et al. (2014) and Frı́as et al. (2012).

high and low type workers to an equilibrium where there is perfect assortative matching. The
firm-level predictions in their set-up between exporters and non-exporters are stylized in that there
is no predicted variation in the type of workers hired by different types of firms under trade.
The relationship of this paper to the theoretical framework in Helpman et al. (2010) and Helpman et al. (2013) deserves a more detailed analysis, since both models describe the matching of
heterogeneous firms to heterogeneous workers in the presence of search frictions. The main conceptual difference between the two theoretical approaches is the nature of workers heterogeneity.
In Helpman et al. (2010) workers are not ex-ante different, but they have a productivity draw that
is firm specific. Therefore there is no sense in which an ex-ante a high-type worker is more likely
to match with a high-type firm, since a firm simply select the workers that have better productivity draws relative to that firm only. In general our estimation procedure, which presumes the
existence of a fixed worker type is incompatible with their view of ex-ante identical workers. Let
us for a moment set aside this difference and investigate the predictions of their model in terms
of the dispersion of worker types within firms. Under the assumption of a Pareto distribution,
exporters (and more productive firms in general) choose a higher cut-off for hiring workers. This
results in a distribution of workers within firm that has higher standard deviation, higher mean
and a constant coefficient of variation (the ratio of standard deviation to mean). Therefore we
need an alternative theoretical framework to investigate the impact of exporting on matching of
permanently heterogeneous workers and firms that also face the possibility of exporting.
The remainder of the paper is divided in four sections. Section 2 introduces the theoretical
framework and derives the main result on the dispersion of worker types at the firm level. Section
3 presents the estimation of worker types and presents empirical results linking export status and
dispersion of worker type in the firm. Section 4 presents the model calibration and the numerical
results on welfare. Section 5 concludes.

Theoretical framework

The role of the theoretical framework is to understand why exporting firms may match with a
different pool of workers from non-exporters. In particular, we are interested in two characteristics
of the pool of workers hired by exporters: the average worker type and, most importantly, the
variation in worker type at the firm level.
The setup is borrowed from Eeckhout & Kircher (2011), a dynamic model where heterogeneous
firms and heterogeneous workers match in the presence of search frictions. There is a unit mass of
workers and a unit mass of firms. A worker’s type θ is distributed according to a smooth density
g (θ) on the interval [0, 1], while a firm’s type ψ is distributed according to smooth density h0 (ψ)
on the interval [0, 1].
Output is produced by a firm that employs one worker, according to the production function
f (θ, ψ) = (θψ)σ where σ > 0.

2

We embed the matching problem in a monopolistic competition

model à la Krugman (1979). Each firm produces a differentiated variety of a product. Demand for
an individual variety is isoelastic with elasticity η > 1. Therefore firms selling their output in the
domestic market obtain total revenues:

Rd (θ, ψ) = (θψ)

σ(η−1)
η

1

Eη

where E represents domestic total real expenditures. Firm revenues are increasing in the type
of the firm and the worker and feature complementarity between the two types, i.e. fθψ > 0.
Complementarity is key for whether there is positive assortative matching in equilibrium between
firms and workers.
2

An extension to a firm with n is trivial if there are no complementarities among workers. In this case the firm
solves the same problem n times. If we allow complementarities between workers we can show that our basic result
is confirmed. See section 2.1.4.

7

Under these assumptions, in the absence of frictions, we would observe perfect positive assortative matching. Under that scenario every type of firm would be matched with a unique type of
worker. In particular, a more productive firm would be matched with a more productive worker,
but there would be no variation within the set of workers matched with firms of a given type ψ, as
in Sampson (2012).
We are interested in analyzing the variation between workers employed by the same type of
firm. We therefore introduce frictions in the spirit of Atakan (2006), although we follow the timing
simplification proposed by Eeckhout & Kircher (2011).3 There are two periods. In the first period
workers and firms meet at random, they perfectly observe one another’s type and decide whether
to produce. If they do not produce they pay a cost c to search again in the second period. In
the second period matching happens in a frictionless and competitive setting, therefore perfect
assortative matching is the equilibrium outcome as in Becker (1973). Before describing how the
equilibrium matching is determined we describe how we interpret the exporting decision in this
simple set-up.
We introduce exporting in the simplest possible way, yet one that has similar features to the
rest of the literature. There are different options when introducing a firm-level exporting decision.
The original contribution by Melitz (2003) simply introduces a fixed cost of exporting common
to all firms. This modelling choice implies that we should never observe two firms of the same
productivity, but different export status. The stark prediction that all exporters should be more
productive than non-exporters is clearly not supported by the data, as argued for example byBernard et al. (2003) and Helpman et al. (2013). In both US and Brazilian data the distribution
of productivity of exporters has a higher mean, but also displays a substantial overlap with the
productivity distribution of non-exporters, a feature that is clearly shared by our French sample as
3

Extending the model to an infinite horizon framework does not alter the qualitative predictions of the equilibrium.
The analytical characterization, however, requires that workers and firms have the same distribution. In the appendix
we also include a numerical simulation without assuming equal distributions of worker and firm types.

shown in Figure A4.
Because, similarly to Helpman et al. (2013), in our exercise we focus on the effect of exporting
separately from that of firm productivity, we adopt a similar strategy of allowing different firms
to have different costs of exporting. This may reflect various idiosyncratic factors such as better
knowledge of the export market that makes setting up an export operation less costly. Because
our interest in this paper is exclusively in comparing exporters and non-exporters and not in the
endogenous sorting into exporting or the estimation of the fixed cost of exporting, we make one
further simplifying assumption. We assume that some firms draw a prohibitively high fixed cost
of exporting, while the rest of the firms draw a negligible fixed cost. All firms that export face
an iceberg transport cost τ > 1. This is the simplest way of introducing heterogeneous exporting
behaviour among firms of identical type.
When a firm exports, its revenues increase even if the firm is not allowed to adjust its workforce.
The firm sells its output in a market where the first unit sold of its differentiated variety is valued
much more by foreign consumers than the last unit sold in the home market was valued by domestic
consumers. The firm allocates output produced between the two markets so that marginal revenues
are equalized in the two markets. This implies that, similarly to Helpman et al. (2010), total
revenues of a firm ψ that exports can be written as follows:

Rx (θ, ψ) = (θψ)

σ(η−1)
η

E + E ∗ τ 1−η

1

,

where E ∗ is foreign real expenditure.
It is straightforward to verify that, for given θ and ψ, revenues of an exporting firm are larger
than those of a non-exporting firm. It is useful to rewrite revenues of an exporting firm and a

9

non-exporting firm with given productivity ψ as follows:

Rd (θ, ψ) = (Ad θψ)
Rx (θ, ψ) = (Ax θψ)

and A∗ > A. We therefore establish the

following property.
Remark 1 Exporting is isomorphic to an increase in productivity for a firm of initial productivity ψ.
Based on Remark 1 we are going to analyse the effect on matching of export status by characterizing the matching behaviour of more productive versus less productive firms.
Until now we have not discussed the distribution of worker types and, more importantly, of firm
types. In principle we could start with a specific distribution of firm types h0 (ψ), introduce export
opportunities and derive a distribution of types based on adjusted firm type Ai ψ where i = d, x.
For the sake of tractability we instead make an assumption directly regarding the distribution of
adjusted firm types, ϕ = Ai ψ, and assume that such distribution h (ϕ) is uniform. We assume that
the distribution of worker types g (θ) is also uniform as in Eeckhout & Kircher (2011).4 In section
4.2 we introduce actual type distributions from the data in a numerical exercise.

2.1

Matching problem

We now solve the matching problem and derive predictions regarding the matching behaviour of
exporters versus non-exporting firms. We start by characterizing second period wages, profits and
assignment and then analyse period one firms’ and workers’ decisions. Once again, the problem is

Although the problem remains tractable as long as worker and firm types are distributed according to the same
distribution, the measures of dispersion that we will adopt will not be meaningful for generic distributions.

R (θ, ϕ) = (θϕ)α where α =

Second period: frictionless market

In the second period, assignment is positive assortative. The matching function, µ (θ) = ϕ, which
assigns firm ϕ to worker θ is therefore µ (θ) = θ. In a competitive equilibrium the wage function
w (θ) must be such that the marginal revenues for a firm from hiring a better worker is equal to
the marginal increase in the wage paid. The equilibrium wage is therefore given by:

Acceptance sets

We now determine the matching behaviour of firms and workers in the first period. When a worker
θ and a firm ϕ meet, they produce R (θ, ϕ). The outside option for the worker is w∗ (θ) − c, while
the outside option for the firm is π ∗ (ϕ) − c. Regardless of how surplus is split, the worker and the
firm will accept to match if the surplus from the relationship is positive, i.e. if the following surplus
condition holds:

The surplus condition (5) defines the acceptance set, i.e. the set of pairs (θ, ϕ) where a match
is mutually acceptable. The set of workers that match with firm ϕ are denoted by A (ϕ). The

boundaries of set A (ϕ) are shown by Eeckhout & Kircher (2011) to be monotonically increasing in

Let us define u (ϕ) and l (ϕ), respectively, the highest and the lowest worker type that matches
with firm type ϕ. Figure 1 illustrates the acceptance set for α = 1 and c = 0.01.

2.1.3

Exporting and the Width of the Acceptance Set

We now investigate whether exporting (or more productive) firms tolerate higher or lower variation
in the set of workers they match with. We adopt the matching range of firm type ϕ, d (ϕ), as
a measure of the dispersion of workers types tolerated by the firm. The matching range d (ϕ) is
defined as the difference between u (ϕ) and l (ϕ). At this point it is important to discuss whether
the absolute measure d (ϕ) is an appropriate measure by which we can compare dispersion of worker
types within firms that exhibit differences also in the average type of worker hired. Let us take for
example the parametrization in figure 1 and consider two firms. Firm ϕH hires on average very
high worker types and firm ϕL hires on average very low worker types. Figure 1 implies that we

output loss as in Shimer & Smith (2000).

12

should observe the same d (ϕ) for both firms, but we would probably not conclude that the two
firms tolerate the same degree of worker variation. This is because, in relative terms, firm ϕH
tolerates less variation relative to the average worker hired than firm ϕL . Hence we argue that
the correct way to analyse the matching range is to adopt scale-free dispersion measures and we
propose two alternatives:
(i) a normalized matching range d1 (ϕ) where we divide the matching range by the average
worker type hired by firm ϕ, i.e. a (ϕ). Define d1 (ϕ) = u1 (ϕ) − l1 (ϕ) where u1 (ϕ) =
and l1 (ϕ) =

u(ϕ)
a(ϕ)

l(ϕ)
a(ϕ)

(ii) a logarithmic matching range d2 (ln ϕ) i.e. a measure defined on a logarithmic scale so that
dispersion is defined in relative revenue deviations. Define d2 (ln ϕ) = u2 (ϕ) − l2 (ϕ) where
u2 (ϕ) = ln u (ϕ) and l2 (ϕ) = ln l (ϕ).
The following proposition establishes the main result regarding variability of worker types at
more productive firms and exporters.
Proposition 1 Dispersion of worker types working at firm ϕ, as measured by
(i) normalized matching range d1 (ϕ) and
(ii) logarithmic matching range d2 (ln ϕ)
is decreasing in firm type (and is therefore lower for exporting firms relative to non-exporting
firms of identical initial productivity).

is a decreasing function

of ϕ. Similarly one can show that l1 (ϕ) is an increasing function of ϕ. Therefore the difference
between u1 (ϕ) and l1 (ϕ) is decreasing.

2.1.4

One firm with multiple workers

The model we have analysed so far entails only one worker. In that context we have said that we
can interpret a firm as a collection of hiring decisions that are independent from one another.
One may wonder whether adding more workers to the problem modifies the results. In principle
there is a somewhat distinct reason why firms may not want to hire very heterogeneous sets of
workers and that is because workers types are complementary to one another, and not just to the
firm. Nevertheless, because of complementarity with the firm type this effect is stronger for more
productive firms. As a result this effect will strengthen the logic that we have illustrated in the oneworker set-up. Consider for example the case of two workers (each drawn from a distinct uniform
productivity distribution): θ1 and θ2 where the production function is R (ϕ, θ1 , θ2 ) = (ϕθ1 θ2 )α
Assuming, as in this production function, that in case of disagreement the firm cannot produce
with only one worker, the surplus condition is very similar to (6) and we can write it in normalized

15

terms analogously to (6):

It is immediate to verify that the same logic applies in this case. Surplus declines

faster for more productive firms as they consider worker types that are further away from their
ideal. Hence a higher ϕ firm will accept a narrower set of workers than a lower ϕ firm.
In the next section we introduce data and methodology aimed at verifying the empirical content
of the results in proposition 1.

Our empirical analysis proceeds in two steps. First, following the theory, we construct worker types
using the average wage of the worker over her job spells. As a robustness check, we also estimate
the worker types employing a methodology pioneered by Abowd et al. (1999) (AKM) and recently
enriched by Card et al. (2013). We are careful to separately construct measures of the firm type
that are not derived as firm fixed effects, due to considerations on the AKM methodology by EK. In
a second step we propose various measures that approximate the matching range of individual firms
and show that those measures are systematically different between exporters and non exporters,
both in the cross section and when export markets are subject to shocks that affect the profitability
of exporting.
Before describing our empirical strategy in details, we offer a brief overview of the features of
the wage-setting institutions in France and of the data employed in this paper.

3.1

Institutional Background

It is important to discuss whether the features of the French institutional setting match the assumptions made in the theoretical framework. Our model assumes that wages are the outcome of
a bargaining game between firms and workers. This condition is key to the empirical analysis in
order for wage outcomes to reflect workers’ and firms’ characteristics. We argue that the French
institutional background provides a good approximation of this feature.
Since 1950, wage-setting institutions in France are organized according to a hierarchical principle. Wages are bargained at three different levels: (i) at the national level, a binding minimum
wage (called Salaire Minimum Interprofessionnel de Croissance, or SMIC hereafter) is set by the
government;6 (ii) at the industry level, employers’ organisations and unions negotiate pay scales;
wages are, then, negotiated occupation by occupation; (iii) at the firm level, employers and unions
usually negotiate wage increases.
Typically, in the 1970’s and 1980’s collective agreements were negotiated within different sectors
between unions and employer associations, then extended by the Ministry of Labour to the entire
industry, becoming binding also for workers and firms not part of the original negotiation. At
the end of the 1980s, more than 95% of the workforce was covered by those collective agreements.
However, different laws have strengthened the decentralization of the wage bargaining process in
France over the last thirty years. Three channels have been used to promote firm-level agreements:
(i) the obligation for firms to negotiate on wages each year, (ii) more possibilities offered to firms
to deviate from industry-level agreements (escape clauses), and (iii) fiscal incentives.7 In 1982,
the Auroux Law introduced the duty for firms with at least 50 employees and an elected union
representative to negotiate wages with unions every year, although not the obligation to reach an

Until 2010, the SMIC was raised each year in July according to a legal formula based on partial indexation to
past inflation and to past wage growth.

agreement. Subsequent legislations concerning the working time reduction (Robien’ s laws in 1996,
the first Aubry’s law in 1998, the second Aubry’s law in 2000) allowed the application of escape
clauses to working hours’ arrangements, reinforcing the trend towards decentralization.
Since the 1980s, firm-level negotiations acquired progressively more importance. By 2005, 41%
of the workers employed in private firms with more than 10 employees were covered by a wage
agreement signed that very same year (Naboulet & Carlier, 2007).8 .

3.2

Data

The data for our project come from three main sources, the Déclaration Annuelle des Données
Sociales (DADS), the Enquete Annuelle d’Entreprises (EAE) and the French Customs Data.9
DADS is an administrative database of matched employer-employee information collected by
the INSEE (Institut Nationale de la Statistique et des Etudes Economique). The data are based
on the mandatory reports, filed by employers, of the gross earnings of each employee in compliance
with French payroll taxes. All wage-paying individuals and legal entities established in France
are required to file payroll declarations; only individuals employing civil servants are excluded
from filing such declarations. The INSEE prepares extracts of the original database for research
purposes. We rely on the panel version of DADS, which covers all individuals employed in French
enterprises born in the month of October of even-numbered years until 2001 and every year after
that.10 This choice is motivated by the need to follow workers across years and job positions in
order to recover their type (see 3.3).
Our extract stretches from 1995 to 2007. The initial data set contains around 24 million
observations (corresponding to the triplet worker-firm-year) which are identified by worker and
8

In 1992, 40% of the workforce was covered by some firm-level agreement. Source: Abowd et al. (2005); authors’
calculation based on data from wage structure survey in 1992.

These data are subject to statistical secrecy and have been accessed at CEPII

In 2002, the sampling methodology has been extended to include all individuals born in the month of October
of every year. Currently, the DADS panel represents 1/12th of the total French workforce.

firm ID (respectively, nninouv and siren).
For each observation we have information on the individual’s gender, year and place of birth,
occupation (both 2-digit CS and 4-digit PCS-ESE classification), job spell,11 full-time/part-time
status, annualized real earnings, total number of hours worked as well as the industry of the employing firm (NAF700, 4-digit industry classification). We restrict our sample to full-time employees
in manufacturing (NAF 10-33), reducing the total number of observations to 2, 662, 411. Most
full-time workers are employed at a single firm during the year. Only 6% has more than one employer in a given year; for those, we selected the enterprise at which the individual worked the
largest number of days during the year. Finally, to control for possible outliers, we remove those
observations whose log annualized real earnings are more than 5 standard deviation away from the
predicted wage, based on a linear model including gender, an ile-de-France dummy and in-firm
experience. We obtain a final sample of 2, 579, 414.
Following EK, we have to find an alternative proxy for the type of the firm to the standard
estimated firm fixed effects. So we enrich the available set of firm-level variables by merging DADS
with EAE, a survey-based dataset containing balance-sheet information on French firms in manufacturing over the period 1995-2007. The unit of observation in EAE is a firm-year combination;
the firm identifier is the same as the firm ID in DADS (siren). EAE samples only medium-large
enterprises with at least 20 employees. From EAE we collect information on sales (domestic and
exports), total employment, value added and also on the main sector of the firm (NAF700 4-digit
classification).12 The merge with EAE further reduces the sample availability. We restrict our sample to individuals working for firms whose characteristics are available from EAE. Furthermore, we
remove those firms whose number of sampled employees from DADS is larger than the effective

DADS records both the job start date and the number of days the individual worked in a given firm during the
calendar year.

We compare the firm’s industry classification between EAE and DADS and keep only those observations whose
industry information coincides between the two sources.

employment reported in EAE. This provides us a final sample of 1, 673, 992 observations on which
we implement our empirical strategy.
Export-related information on French firms come from the French Customs. The customs data
includes export records at the firm-product-destination level for the universe of exporters located
in France.
Finally, aggregated trade flows and applied tariff levels come from standard sources, respectively
COMTRADE and WITS. Aggregated trade flows are used to compute aggregated market shocks
as (weighted) import demand by all potential French trade partners, while applied tariff levels are
used as a second proxy for foreign market openness - average tariff reduction (across all French
trade partners) representing a measure of higher market access for French firms.

3.3

Constructing worker types

We propose two strategies to construct worker types.

Worker type proxy: Average Lifetime Wage
Our preferred methodology follows the model and uses the average wage of the worker over her
job spells - hereafter, average lifetime wage- to proxy for the worker type. In fact, the average
lifetime wage is monotonically related to the worker type θ: a more productive worker makes larger
contributions to revenues and expects to match with a better firm in the frictionless equilibrium,
obtaining, on average, a higher wage. From the model, the average lifetime wage of a worker of
type θ takes the following expression
R (θα +2√c)1/α h θ2α

(8)

In appendix section A.2 we formally show that the average lifetime wage is increasing in the worker
type θ. However, the expression for the average lifetime wage (8) also captures the measure of the
matching set and the average productivity of the firms within the matching set of a worker of ability
θ. To remove the effect of the average firm productivity, we construct worker types employing a
second strategy, the AKM methodology.

Worker type proxy: Worker Fixed Effects
This methodology aims at decomposing individual workers’ wages into a firm component and a
worker component.13 The basic specification relates a measure of log compensation for worker i
employed in firm j at time t to workers and firms’ effects:

ln wit = x0it β + θi + ψJ(i,t) + εit

(9)

where θi is worker i’s component and ψJ(i,t) is the firm component. The function J (i, t) = j
identifies the firm employing worker i at time t. The vector xit includes time-varying worker characteristics, therefore the component θi captures persistent differences in compensation explained
by ability and other time-invariant worker characteristics. We assume that the error term εit is
i.i.d. across time and workers with mean zero. This assumption requires that employment mobility is exogenous, depending only on observable characteristics, person and firm effects. More
precisely, the fixed effects estimator conditions on the whole sequence of establishments at which
each worker is observed; this implies that the exogenous mobility assumption is not violated in
presence of systematic mobility patterns driven by the person effect θi and/or the sequence of firm

effects ψJ(i,t) , ψJ(i,t+1) , . . . , ψJ(i,T ) . The assumption is, instead, violated if mobility depends, for
13

The AKM methodology has seen a very large number of applications, e.g. Abowd et al. (2003), Abowd et al.
(2005), Abowd et al. (2006) Abowd et al. (2007), Abowd et al. (2008), Abowd et al. (2009), Abowd et al. (2009),
Carneiro et al. (2012) Torres et al. (2012).

21

example, on match-specific components of wages.

14

We follow AKM for the explicit specification of (9). Our dependent variable is the log of
annualized real wages.15 We include as time-varying controls a quartic in employer-specific experience,16 time-dummies, a dummy for workers residing in Ile-de-France and time-varying gender
effects (exactly, the interactions of sex with all the other variables).
The panel version of DADS does not contain information on education. AKM obtain information on the highest degree attained from the permanent demographic sample (Echantillon
Démographique Permanent, EDP). However, this information would be available, in our case, only
for about 20% of the workers in our sample. Thus, we decided not to include a control for schooling
in our decomposition.17
As described in Abowd et al. (2002), fixed effects for workers and firms can be separately
identified only for sets of firms and workers that are ‘connected’ by moving workers. In fact, the
person effect is common to all of the individual’s job spells; its identification requires observing
the individual at different employers. Similarly, a firm effect is common to all employees of the
firm; identifying the firm effect requires observations on multiple employees of the firm. Identifying
both effects requires mobility of workers across firms.18 The movement of workers between firms
characterizes a connected group. A connected group is defined by all workers who ever worked for
any firm in the group and all firms whose workforce is included in the group. A second group is
14

The results estimated under the assumption that the error term εit includes a match effect ηiJ(i,t) and an
idiosyncratic term as in Card et al. (2013) and Woodcock (2008) are qualitatively similar to those in Tables 3 and 4.
15
Working hours are often not reported. The restriction to full-time workers absorbs possible differences in hours
worked across individuals.
16
DADS contains information on the job starting date at a certain firm - we compute the employer-specific experience as a difference between the current year and the first year of employment at the firm.
17
In addition, most of the effect of schooling would be absorbed by the person effect. AKM mention that schooling
does not time-vary over their sample.
18
Let us consider a simple example of how to implement the AKM methodology. Consider a connected group with
2 firms and N workers and suppose that at least one worker, individual 1, is employed in both firms over the sample
period. The observed wage differential for individual 1 is entirely attributed to the difference between firms fixed
effects. Normalizing the mean firm effect to zero, it is possible to identify one of the fixed effects. A similar argument
applies to the identification of the person effect.

22

unconnected to the first if no firm in the first group has ever employed any worker from the second
group and no firm in the second has ever employed workers from the first. Within each group, we
normalize the mean of the fixed effects to zero, therefore it is not possible to identify 1 individual
and 1 firm effects per group.
Due to the normalization, comparing fixed effects between groups has no real meaning. Therefore, when comparing workers and firms, we only employ estimated fixed effects from the largest
connected group, which represents 88% of the workers in our final sample.
The estimation of the fixed effects is performed using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm, proposed by
Guimaraes & Portugal (2010). Such algorithm consists in solving the partitioned set of normal
equations, associated to (9), given an initial guess on the coefficients. Workers’ and firms’ fixed
effects are recovered as coefficients on the dummy variables identifying the worker and the firm at
which the worker is employed. According to Smyth (1996), the Gauss-Seidel algorithm achieves
a stable, but slow convergence, depending on the correlation between the parameter estimators.
This implementation has the advantage of not requiring an explicit calculation of inverse matrices
to determine the vector of coefficients nor forces us to drop small firms, due to the large number of
firm effects to estimate.19
We recover estimates for the fixed effects for 406404 individuals and 31649 firms. In the appendix, we include the distribution of the worker fixed effects (Figure A5) and firm fixed effects
(figure A6) for the largest connected group.
With estimates of worker types at hand, we now proceed to construct measures of the average
worker type and dispersion of worker type at the firm level. Specifically, we construct the variables
19
The number of firms’ fixed effect is too large for e.g. the felsdv estimator. In such case, Andrews et al. (2006)
suggest pooling small plants into a single superplant. However, we prefer not to implement a similar strategy, as, in
our case, firms - not plants - are the units of observation.

where Ijt is the set of workers employed by firm j at time t, w̄j,75th and w̄j,25th are the types of the
workers at the 75th and 25th percentile of firm j’s employee type distribution.
We build these measures only for firms with more than 5 sampled workers. The choice of the
threshold is a compromise between retaining a sample of satisfactory size and constructing sample
measures that approximate the true underlying measures. On the one hand, a larger threshold
forces us to cut a larger percentage of the sample. On the other hand, a larger number of sampled
workers reduces the noise in the estimation of a firm’s matching set. We consider each employment
relation to be a realization of a match along the set of acceptable matches within a firm’s matching
set. In the limit, increasing the number of match realizations, the constructed statistics of worker
types converges to the true measure. Choosing a higher threshold does not affect the results. If
including firms with less than 5 sampled workers, instead, the coefficients on our variables of interest
are of the correct sign but in some specifications are not significant.

Firm types

For the purpose of comparing matching choices of exporting and non-exporting firms, we need to
control for the type of the firm. EK show that the relationship between true firm type and firm
fixed effects estimated from a AKM-style wage regression is theoretically ambiguous, i.e. it can be

In the appendix, we report the results from GLS regressions including also firms with less than 5 workers,
weighting by the number of workers. See Tables A7-A10.

24

positive, negative or zero.21 EK also argue that the ideal firm component is a measure of firm type
that is specific to every job within the firm, but measurable variables such as output and profits
are obviously only observed at the aggregate firm level, not for each relationship within the firm.
We therefore adopt three proxies for firm type to investigate the behaviour of firms fixed effects ψ:
value added per worker of firm j, V Apwj , the logarithm of total employment in firm j, log Empj
and share in the domestic market DomSharej , defined as the ratio of firm j’s domestic sales to
total domestic sales in the firm’s sector (each firm is classified as belonging to only one sector in
each year).22 While the first two proxies are standard measures of the productivity or demand
intensity for a firm product, the third is motivated by Eaton et al. (2011). In particular, while
the first two proxies contain a measure of success over all markets, including the foreign ones, the
third variable better captures the success of the firm with respect to the domestic market, before
the choice of exporting. We average each proxy over the years the firm appears in the sample to
smooth out the effect of changes in the workforce.23
We first confirm the hypothesis put forward by EK regarding the ability of the AKM firm fixed
effects to capture the firm type. Table 1 shows the pairwise correlation between the AKM firm
fixed effect, the three proxies for firm type and the average worker type at firm j as measured
by the average AKM worker fixed effect, AvWorkerType j over the sample period at firm j. The
first striking fact is the negative and large correlation (−0.80) between average worker type and
the AKM firm fixed effects ψ, confirming previous findings by Abowd et al. (2004). If instead
we employ the three proxies for firm type, we observe for each of them a positive and significant
21
In a recent contribution Hagedorn et al. (2012) show how to complement wage data with labour market transitions
to identify the pattern of sorting.
22
We consider sectors at the 4-digit level for the constructions of market shares.
23
Our model confirms the positive correlation between productivity, value added per worker and domestic market
share. According to our theory, more productive firms tend to match with better workers, realizing on average larger
revenues. Therefore, firms of higher productivity should display larger value added per worker and a larger share in
the domestic market. The model is silent about employment differences due to variations in productivity, since we
focus on one firm-one worker matching. If we introduce homogeneous labour in the production function, the model
will also address the implication that more productive firms hire a larger workforce.

correlation with the average worker type, proxied either with the average lifetime wage or the
average of the worker fixed effects. The three firm type proxies are in turn all positively correlated
with one another, but display small and sometimes opposite correlations with the AKM fixed effect
ψ. In particular DomSharej and V Apwj have a positive correlation of 0.01 and of 0.001 with ψ,
respectively, while and log Empj displays a negative correlation of −0.01.
Table 2 shows that this correlation pattern is not unique to a few sectors. In column 4 we report
the correlation between AvWorkerType j and ψj by two-digit sector, while column 6 displays the
analogous correlation between DomSharej and AvWorkerType j . While the first set of correlations
is always negative and significant, the second set of correlations is positive and significant, except
in one case where the correlation is positive, but not significant. The evidence presented in tables 1
and 2 is consistent with the hypothesis put forward by EK, that the AKM firm fixed effect may not
be correlated with the true firm type, although it is still possible that, as in Abowd et al. (2004),
there is truly negative assortative matching between workers and firms or that the negative result
is purely due to statistical bias arising from the short nature of the panel.

3.5

Empirical Specification 1: Export Status and Acceptance Set

We now proceed to illustrate the specifications employed to describe the different matching behaviour of exporting and non-exporting firms. The first implication of our model is that exporting
firms hire workers of higher average type. This is a similar prediction to the models of Sampson
(2012) and, under the interpretation of permanent worker heterogeneity, Helpman et al. (2010).
We believe this is a novel method of corroborating such prediction since it shows directly that an
exporter pays higher wages because it employs better workers, not because it shares higher revenues
with the same type of workers. The former is the mechanism involved in explaining the exporter
wage premium in Helpman et al. (2010), but we believe it has not been tested before.

26

In a pooled cross-section of firms over the sample period, the basic specification we employ is
the following:

AvWorkerType jt = β0 + β1 Export jt + β2 Firm Type jt + Dst + ujt

(10)

where Export jt = 1 if firm j exports at time t and Firm Type jt is one or all of the three proxies for
firm productivity, V Apwj , log Empj and DomSharej .
Differences in average worker type between exporters and non-exporters also reflect differences
in the occupational structure. If, for example, exporters employ workers in occupations with higher
average wage, they might also have higher average type, since the person effect contains all timeinvariant characteristics, like occupation, that rarely change over time for a given worker.24 We
add the number of occupation, N.occjt and the share of white collar workers,25 whiteshare, to
specification (10). Similarly, the number of exported products, log P roducts, which we include
in the specification with all controls, is intended to capture structural differences in occupational
complexity that might cause a spurious correlation of the exporting status with the average worker
type.
In addition, all specifications except the first include a quadratic in the number of sampled
workers to control for the precision of our left-hand side estimates.26 Finally, all specifications
include sector-year dummies, Dst .
The novel contribution of this paper is the prediction that exporters match with workers that
are characterized by lower relative dispersion of ability. The specification that we employ is the
24

Around 80% of the workers in the sample do not switch occupation during the time period analysed.
The blue vs white collar classification is based on occupational codes. We report the classification we adopt in
Table A2.
26
In unreported results we simulated the model and verified that differences in the number of observations available
for exporters and non-exporters do produce differential biases that can justify the quantitative estimates we obtain. In
order words exporting firms do not have a large enough number of observations to mechanically reduce the standard
deviation of worker types by the amount we observe.
25

27

following:
SdWorkerType jt = β00 + β10 Export jt + β20 Firm Type jt + Dst + u0jt .

(11)

The theoretical section shows that the only robust prediction regarding the link between worker
type dispersion and export status (and productivity) requires expressing such dispersion either in
percentage terms or relative to the average worker type. In this regard, it is essential to remember
that the fixed effects are estimated from a log-linearized equation, where types are therefore already
expressed in percentage differences from one another. Nevertheless we will add the average worker
type in the specification with all controls.27
Similarly to specification (10), we include the number of occupations, N.occjt , the share of
white collar workers, white share and the number of exported products, log P roducts, to control for
differences in the occupational structure across firms with different export status. All specifications
include sector-year dummies, Dst .
Both specifications (10) and (11) are estimated by OLS and standard errors are clustered at
the level of the firm.
We develop an alternative strategy to test the prediction that exporters select a set of workers
characterized by a lower dispersion. We compare the rank correlation between the average worker
type by firm and the firm type among exporters to the rank correlation between the average worker
type and firm types among non-exporters. In fact, the rank correlation captures the strength of
sorting patterns. A lower dispersion among exporters implies better sorting and should be associated
with a larger correlation. We construct the rank correlation separately for exporters and for nonexporters for each sector-year and we test the existence of systematic differences in the correlation
according to export status, employing the following specification:
27

All results are very similar if we adopt the coefficient of variation of worker type as our dependent variable.

= β000 + β100 Export st + Ds + Dt + u00st .

(12)

where Export st = 1 if the correlation is constructed for the set of exporting firms in sector s
at time t. In addition to sector and time dummies, we also include the average (log) employment
and the average domestic market share of firms in the same sector-year-export status cell, because
those characteristics might differentially affect the matching patterns and be correlated with export
status.

Results
The estimation results relative to specifications (10) and (11) are presented in Tables 3 and 4.
Column 1 of Table 3 reports a positive and statistically significant relationship between export
status and the average type of the worker employed by the firm. The positive relationship is of
similar strength when we introduce in turn the three controls for firm type (domestic share, value
added per worker and employment).
As predicted by theory, the coefficient on all three proxies for firm type is positive and significant,
like the one on export status. In the specification reported in column 4 we include the three controls
for firm type in the same regression, and the coefficient on export (the one of our interest) remains
positive and significant, like the ones on value added per worker and employment.
Table 4 reports the results of the estimation of specification (11) and has a similar structure to
Table 3. Starting from column 1 where no controls are added, we document the expected negative
and significant relationship between export status and variability of worker type. The effect persists
with a similar magnitude when we control for the above mentioned firm type controls (domestic
share, employment and value added per worker). The inclusion of all the control variables in column
(6) does not alter the negative and significant coefficient on the export dummy. As predicted by
29

theory, the coefficient on two proxies for firm type is negative (columns 2 and 3), but the table also
documents a positive and significant correlation between value added per worker and the dispersion
of worker type (column 4 - 6) a pattern that is not in line with the predictions of the model.
It is important to quantify the effect at the core of this paper. Based on our preferred specification, column 6 of Table 4, where we include all controls, the expected difference on the dispersion
of worker type between exporter and non-exporter firms is about 0.037 points (holding the other
variables constant). Considering that the dependent variable has a standard deviation of 0.41, an
exporter features worker variability that is lower by 9% standard deviations. The effect on the
mean worker type can be calculated using the results from Table 3 and is of the same order of
magnitude, but slightly smaller: an exporting firm displays an average worker type that is 3.9%
standard deviations higher.28
In Tables A5 and A6, we report the result separately for the sample of newly hired workers and
for the stayers. Intuitively, the export dummy is negative and significant only when we consider
the newly hired sample, as reported in Table A5. This is a reasonable result given that firing costs
and other labour market protection measures plausibly make the firing margin less flexible than
the hiring one.
Tables 5 and 6 report estimates for the same specifications as in tables 3 and 4, but employ
a different proxy for the worker type, i.e. worker fixed effect from the AKM regression. Table 5
reports again a positive relationship between export status and average worker type; the coefficient
on export status remains positive but loses its significance when adding controls for firm type and
the occupation structure. Table 6 confirms a negative relationship between the dispersion of worker
type and export status. Controlling for the type of the firm (by using employment, domestic market
share and value added per worker), the coefficient on export is negative and once again we find
28

This magnitude has been computed by using the export coefficient of Table 3 column 6. The standard deviation
of the average worker type is 0.81.

30

that firms with higher employment and higher domestic share have tighter worker type dispersion
- coherently with the model. But, again, firms with high value added per worker have a wider
variation.

Endogeneity of Export Status
We have not discussed so far the potential endogeneity of export status and the bias resulting
from unobserved firm characteristics that may affect the export status and the standard deviation
of worker types simultaneously. To address this concern, we develop an instrumental variable
strategy. We instrument export status using a firm-level measure of tariff,



Firm Tariffjt = ln 1 + P

sr τsrt

1
Exportsjr,t−1
Exportsj,t−1



(13)

where τsrt is the tariff faced by firms in sector s exporting to country r at time t − 1; we aggregate
across countries using as weights the share of exports to country r of firm j at time t over the
total exports of firm j at time t − 1,

Exportsjr,t−1
Exportsj,t−1 .

Table 7 reports the second stage results29 . The

coefficient on export status remains negative and significant in all specification. In particular, in
our preferred specification, the coefficient is smaller than the coefficient from the OLS regression
in Table 4; this is consistent with the idea that more productive firms possess a better technology
to search for their workers.

Additional robustness
Table 8 presents the results for specification (11) with an alternative measure of dispersion, a
weighted average of the standard deviation of ability for different groups of workers. In particular,
we divide occupations into ‘managers’, ‘executives’ (white collar occupations) and ‘blue’ collar (as
29

The First Stage is reported in Table A13

31

reported in Table A2) and we construct average employment shares of those occupational groups
within firm over time. We then weigh the standard deviation of lifetime wages for each group by its
average employment share to construct our new dependent variable. The coefficient on the export
dummy remains negative and significant in all specifications; in most columns, the magnitude of
the coefficient is not significantly different from what is reported in Table 4. This suggests that our
result is not due to compositional differences between exporters and non-exporters.
Looking at the coefficients on firm’s type controls (columns 2, 3 and 4 in Table 8) we discover
that employment and domestic market share have the expected sign, i.e. they are negatively related
with the standard deviation of workers types. The coefficient on value added per worker is positive
and significant only in column 6, suggesting that the ‘puzzling’ effect discussed above for tables 4
and 6 might be related to changes in employment composition over time.
Table 9 presents a further robustness of the result to the definition of worker type employed
as dependent variable. In particular, we employ the interquartile range of worker type at firm j,
as described earlier. It is easy to verify that all previously described patterns appear again in this
table. Exporting firms choose a narrower range of worker types.
Finally, Tables A11 and A12 confirm that differences in dispersions translate into higher rank
correlation between average worker types and firm types for exporters compared to non-exporters,
controlling for average size differences. Firm and worker types are more tightly correlated among
exporters than non-exporters.

Empirical specification 2: market access and tariff shocks

Our first empirical strategy has relied on cross-sectional differences between exporting and nonexporting firms. Plausibly, the export dummy may be capturing the effect of other firms characteristics that are not included in our firm type proxies and that affect the matching behaviour of

32

firms.
Our second strategy to detect the impact of exporting on matching between firms and workers
aims at addressing this concern. We exploit differences in the opportunities offered by foreign
markets, approximated by demand shocks and tariffs across sectors and countries over time. These
different shocks, which we indicate as ‘market access’ should affect exporting firms differentially
from non-exporting firms. A positive demand shock in a foreign market or a lower tariff faced by
French exporters should induce the exporting firm to select an even less dispersed labor force. The
specification that we estimate is the following:

AvWorkerType jt = γ0 + γ1 Mkt Access st × Export jt + γ2 Mkt Access st
+γ3 Export jt + Dst + vjt ,

(14)

SdWorkerType jt = γ00 + γ10 Mkt Access st × Export jt + γ20 Mkt Access st

access or demand size in foreign markets for firms in a given sector s, weighted by the importance of
French firms in that sector in the previous year. The model predicts that a good export opportunity
should result in an increase in the average worker type and further tightening of the acceptance set
for an exporting firm, so we expect γ1 < 0 and γ10 > 0 for the case of MktAccess srt =Tariffs srt and
the opposite when market access is measured as Imports srt or

Results

Table 10 and 11 report estimates of the coefficients in specifications (14) and (15) when market
access for a firm in sector s is measured by total demand for imports faced by an exporter in sector
s as in equation (16). We do not present results for the case when total import demand is deflated
by the tariff faced by French exporters because they are very similar. Table 10 reports results on
the average worker type; our coefficient of interest is positive and significant on all specifications.
However, if evaluated at the mean of the market access measured by Importssrt an exporter does
not feature a higher average worker ability; only exporters in sectors with a degree of openness
larger than the average will enjoy an effect on the average worker type.
In Table 11 we find for all specifications that the estimated coefficient γ10 is negative and significant, so that exporters seem to choose a less dispersed workforce in particular when having better
access to foreign markets. The inclusion of firm type controls does not affect the magnitude and
significance of this result. The coefficient on export status is negative and significant in all specifications. If evaluated at the mean of the market access measured by Importssrt , an exporter features
worker variability that is lower by 3.4% standard deviations than a non-exporter firm (which is in
line with the quantification reported in section 3.5.1).
Tables 12 and 13 report estimates of the coefficients in specifications (14) and (15) when market

34

access for a firm in sector s is measured by the average tariff faced by an exporter in sector s. Only
columns 4-6 of Table 12 report a negative coefficient γ1 - which is line with the prediction - but
not statistically significant.
Table 13 reports very similar results to Table 11: better export market conditions as measured
by a lower tariff faced on the export market result in a tighter matching set for exporting firms. So,
contrary to Table 12, the effect of export opportunities on standard deviation of worker type seems
more robust to the definition of market access. In particular, firms exporting in country-sector with
’mean’ market access (mean value equal to 5.58% in our sample) have a lower worker variability
than non-exporters (13.7% standard deviation units), with such gap increasing with the market
access of the firm.

Welfare implications

We have so far not discussed the consequences in terms of welfare of the mechanism explored in
this paper. Our model predicts that exporting firms tolerate less relative dispersion in worker
type, but it does not analyse what happens to exporting and non-exporting firms relative to their
autarky matching decisions. In theory the model features two counteracting effects. While newly
exporting firms have stronger incentives to tighten their matching range, non-exporting firms see
their revenues decline because of import competition and therefore will see an increase in their
normalized matching range. We therefore present our results in two steps. First, we report partial
equilibrium results that examine revenue loss as a function of firm productivity and confirm that
revenue loss is lower for exporting and more productive firms. Second, we turn to a general
equilibrium model where we introduce a second symmetric country and compute overall welfare
changes, taking into account variety effects and price changes.

35

4.1

Revenue loss in partial equilibrium

We start by analysing revenue loss as a function of firm productivity. We choose to present a
measure of revenue loss relative to the optimal allocation as in EK. For each firm ϕ and worker θ
we can define a revenue loss relative to the optimum which we also define L (ϕ, θ) =

1
2

(θα − ϕα )2 .

The assumption in creating such a measure is that in the optimal allocation a worker of type θ
would generate a revenue of θ2α and is allocated half of that revenue. Holding the type of the firm
constant at ϕ we sum the revenue loss, relative to the optimal level, for each possible worker type
in the acceptance set. We then divide for the optimal revenue summed across the same range. We
obtain the share of revenues lost relative to the optimum for a firm of type ϕ (and the workers in
that firm’s acceptance range), which we define RL (ϕ):
R u(ϕ)
RL (ϕ) =

1
α
α 2
l(ϕ) 2 (θ − ϕ ) dθ
R u(ϕ) 1 2α 1 2α
+ 2 ϕ dθ
l(ϕ) 2 θ

(17)

The following proposition shows that such deviations from the optimal revenues are smaller for
more productive firms.

Proposition 2 The share of output lost relative to the optimal revenues, RL (ϕ), is decreasing in
the type of the firm ϕ:

1. For any α, as c → 0
2. For any c if α = 1 or α = 2 or α = 12 .
Proof. See Appendix A.3.
Moreover, we have verified that this result holds for a very wide range or parameters. We
have not been able to find instances where proposition 2 does not hold, although a general proof
is arduous due to many non-integer exponents in the expressions involved. This proposition is a
36

comparison across firm types observed in a given equilibrium, so that for example we can use this
proposition to compare revenue losses of an import-competing firm versus an exporting firm of
the same original underlying productivity. The exporting firm will feature across all the possible
matches in her matching set a lower share of revenues lost because of mismatch. This is a partial
equilibrium result that we cannot employ to evaluate the overall welfare impact of trade opening
because the two equilibria will feature different type distributions and therefore different shapes of
the matching sets. In particular if we want to compare autarky and trade equilibria we can no longer
assume that the distribution of types is uniform. If we start with a uniform distribution for firms
and workers, only the distribution of worker types will remain unchanged, while the distribution
of firms will be affected by the endogenous shock to revenues given by export opportunities and
import competition. Once we move away from a uniform distribution and the two distributions
of workers and firms are no longer symmetric, the analytical characterization becomes intractable.
We therefore resort to a simulation and calibration exercise where we can relax other unrealistic
assumptions and that we describe in the next section.

4.2

Calibration of a general equilibrium model with symmetric countries

We calibrate the infinite-horizon open-economy version of the model31 to match moments of the
French Economy. The two main differences from the simple two period model are that: i) successful
firms and workers pairs are subject to a exogenous rate of separation δ, and that ii) in each period
the probability of meeting a potential match is ρ. The parameters to be calibrated are as follows:
the elasticity of demand, η; the curvature of the production function, σ; the variable trade cost τ ;
the distribution of the fixed export costs; the rate at which matches are dissolved, δ; the rate at
which matches are created, ρ; the search cost c; the worker ability distribution, gθ (θ), and the firm
31

See Tito (2014) for details.

37

productivity distribution, gψ (ψ). We need to calibrate those parameters for both a domestic and
a foreign economy; in what follows, we will assume that the home country and the foreign country
share the same characteristics.
In a model with monopolistic competition and CES preferences, the elasticity of demand η maps
into the trade elasticity, ε = η −1. Following the extensive literature on trade elasticity estimates,32
we set η = 4, the median value over the range of those estimates.
We calibrate the curvature of the production function to the elasticity of a CES-aggregate of
worker types with respect to firm revenues. In our estimation, σ = 0.653.
We use the implied relationship between foreign and domestic shipments at an exporting firm to
identify a plausible parametrization of the variable trade cost. From the model, the ratio between
the output sold in the domestic market and the exported output depends on the relative market
size,
qdd
=
qdx



E
E∗

1/η

τ η−1

(18)

The domestic market size E and the foreign market size E ∗ depend on the set of initial parameters.
However, if the primitives are identical, the domestic and the foreign country have the same size,
E = E ∗ . Therefore, equation (18) implies τ = 1.513.
We normalize fL = 0 and fH → ∞; therefore, the fraction of firms λ drawing the low fixed
export cost corresponds to the fraction of exporters. In our data, λ = 0.8.33
We set the search cost c to match the average within-firm wage dispersion in the data. This
implies c = 0.025. For the meeting rate and the match dissolution rate, we refer to the estimates
from Hairault et al. (2015) for the job finding probability and the separation probability.34
32

See Head & Mayer (2014)
In our dataset, firm-level information is available only for firms with more than 20 employees. This threshold
excludes the biggest portion of non-exporting French firms.
34
Using administrative data on the labour market, Hairault et al. (2015) estimate the job finding probability and
the separation probability from 1994 onwards. They find that the average separation probability is 1.7%, while the
average job finding probability is 13.5%
33

38

Finally, we parametrically estimate the worker ability distribution gθ (θ) and the firm productivity distribution gψ (ψ) using our proxies for agents’ types, average lifetime wage for the worker
and (the rank of the) domestic market share. We assume that both distributions are Beta with
parameters (αθ , βθ ) for workers and (αψ , βψ ) for firms. Table 18 summarizes the parameters from
the calibration.
Next, we move to the welfare analysis. Our analysis focuses on two welfare proxies: changes
in real expenditure and changes in relative deviations from the optimal worker-to-firm assignment,
expression (17). We characterize the steady state equilibrium in the model with two symmetric
countries under the parametrization from Table 14; we then compare the steady state autarky
equilibrium that we derive when setting the share of exporters λ = 0 to the initial equilibrium. In
our formulation this is equivalent to a very large increase in the fixed export costs, fL = fH → ∞.
We find that moving to autarky reduces real expenditure by 22%. The change in real expenditure,
however, captures 3 effects: the change in the number of available varieties, the change in the
worker selection patterns and a price effect. While the first two effects are positively related to
welfare, the third effect, instead, acts to reduce welfare after a trade liberalization. This is due to
the capacity constraint in our model: the output in a match is fixed and proportional to the agents’
types. The demand shock due to the trade liberalization has no impact on the firm’s production
decision; after trade opening, a firm only reallocates part of its output from the domestic to the
foreign market.
The second measure we propose, instead , consists of changes in relative deviations from the
optimal worker-to-firm assignment, captures exclusively selection effects. We construct deviations
from the optimal worker-to-firm assignment comparing the realized real revenues in the presence
of search costs to the real revenues in the frictionless equilibrium; we normalize by the revenues
in the frictionless equilibrium. We find that, in an open economy, the losses are −86.08% of the

39

real revenues under optimal allocation; moving back to autarky implies an increase in the losses to
−87.44%. Therefore, opening to trade is associated with a reduction in the relative deviation from
the efficient allocation by −1.36%.
Further, we look at how our two measures are affected by different levels of search cost c and
α.35 The results are shown in Tables 15 and 16. The numerical results suggest that gains from
trade and frictions are substitutes in our framework. Both changes in real revenues and changes in
relative real revenue losses seems to be non-decreasing in the level of search cost, for a given α.

Conclusions

Using linked employer-employee data from France, we show that exporters and non-exporters match
with sets of workers that are different. Exporters employ workers of higher average type and lower
type dispersion. We rationalize this finding using a model of matching with search frictions where
more productive firms and exporting firms match with better workers and tolerate a lower degree of
dispersion among the workers employed. We also show numerically that the welfare gains from trade
are higher when search costs are higher, which points to a substitutability between trade opening
and the lowering of trade frictions. Trade liberalization seems more important when frictions are
high and the workers allocation is relatively further away from the optimal. This paper therefore
establishes a novel source of gains from trade, where exposure to exports brings the economy closer
to the efficient allocation of workers to firms.

A.1

Proof of decreasing normalized matching range under assumption of homogeneity of revenue function

Assume revenue function f (θ, ϕ) is increasing, symmetric, supermodular and homogeneous in θ
and ϕ.

A.1.1

Outside options: wages and profits

At the optimum, the marginal benefit from hiring a better worker has to equalize the marginal
increase in wage:
dw∗
∂f (θ, ϕ)
=
dθ
∂θ
Outside option for the worker is given by:

w∗ (θ) =

Rθ

∂f (t,x)
dt
∂t
x=µ(t)
0

where, because of symmetry, µ (t) = t.
It is useful to use the following result relating the partial and total derivatives of f :

df (θ, θ)
∂f (θ, x)
=
dθ
∂θ

+
x=θ

∂f (x, θ)
∂θ

x=θ

Again, symmetry implies that the two partial derivatives are identical:

∂f (θ, x)
∂θ

=
x=θ

60

∂f (x, θ)
∂θ

x=θ

therefore the wage w∗ (θ) can be rewritten as:

w∗ (θ) =

Rθ
0

1 df (t,t)
2 dt dt

= 21 f (θ, θ)

The profit function is derived residually as:

1
π ∗ (ϕ) = f (ϕ, ϕ)
2

The matching range is defined by the set of θ that satifies the following inequality:

1
1
f (θ, ϕ) − f (θ, θ) − f (ϕ, ϕ) + 2c ≥ 0
2
2

A.1.2

Let us normalize the matching range by the firm type ϕ:

(A-1)

Assuming that the function is well behaved and that (A-1) is satisfied with equality for only two
values of θ, we can study the behavior of the normalized upper bound u1 (ϕ) =
normalized lower bound l1 (ϕ) =

l(ϕ)
a(ϕ) .

and the

In particular we are interested in proving the following

proposition.
Proposition A-1 The normalized matching range d1 (ϕ) = u1 (ϕ) − l1 (ϕ) is decreasing in ϕ.
Proof. Define normalized worker type as θb =

l1 is increasing in ϕ (case θb < 1).

Identification of Worker Type: Average Lifetime Wage

Agents’ types are positively correlated with the average realization of their pay-offs over their job
spells. In particular, a more productive worker makes larger contribution to revenues and tends to
match with a better firm in the frictionless equilibrium, obtaining, on average, a higher pay-offs.
Following the model, we propose to identify the agents’ type using the average wage. In fact, there
exists a well-defined relation. In fact, the average wage of a worker of type θ,

If the demand elasticity α and the search cost c were known, we could back up exactly the worker
types. In order to prove that the average wage is increasing in θ, we’ll break the proof into two parts.
First, it is trivial to prove that the outside option is increasing in the worker type. The second
part of the proof will show that a worker of higher ability generates a larger surplus and obtains a

63

larger share of it. In the two-period model, under the assumption of a uniform distribution,

Numerical simulation

We simulate the model using the empirical distribution of worker and firm types to show that
the properties of matching bounds are verified under this specification (see Figure A5 for the
distribution of worker types and A6 for the distribution of firm types). Figure A1 shows the
matching set of the economy when normalizing the aggregate price index to unity and assuming
the search cost c = 0.01, the meeting rate ρ = 1 and the exogenous separation rate δ = 1. Using
68

the simulation results, we construct two measures of dispersions of worker types by firm, the length
and the standard deviation36 of the firm matching set. Figure A2 and A3 show that both measures
are decreasing in firm type, when normalized by the average worker type.

Figure A1: Matching Set for the Simulated Economy.
For a given firm type ϕ, the matching set is [l (ϕ) , u (ϕ)].

Figure A2: Standard Deviation of the
Matching Set by firm type, normalized
by the average worker type (d1 (ϕ))

Figure A3: Standard Deviation of the
Matching Set by firm type, normalized
by the average worker type

36

In the empirical analysis, our preferred measure of dispersion is the standard deviation of the worker types by
firm, since it is less sensitive to outliers.
