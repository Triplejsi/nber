Cross-border Acquisitions and Labor Regulations

ABSTRACT
Do labor regulations influence the reaction of stock markets and firm profitability to cross-border acquisitions?
We discover that acquiring firms enjoy smaller abnormal stock returns and profits when targets are
in countries with stronger labor protection regulations, i.e., in countries where laws, regulations, and
policies increase the costs to firms of adjusting their workforces. These effects are especially pronounced
when the target is in a labor-intensive or high labor-volatility industry. Consistent with labor regulations
shaping the success of cross-border deals, we find that firms make fewer and smaller cross-border
acquisitions into countries with strong labor regulations.

1. Introduction
Cross-border acquisitions account for a large and growing proportion of all acquisitions.
The dollar value of cross-border acquisitions rose from an average of $300 billion per annum
during the 1990s to an average of almost $800 billion per annum since 2000. Furthermore, the
proportion of all acquisitions, domestic and international, accounted for by cross-border deals
rose from 24% to 39%. Firms increasing look beyond national borders in conducting mergers
and acquisitions.
Researchers have focused on the financial and corporate governance determinants of
cross-border acquisitions. Erel et al. (2012) show that exchange rate changes and changes in
relative stock market valuations influence the incidence and direction of international deals.
Rossi and Volpin (2004), Bris and Cabolis (2008), and Chari et al. (2009) demonstrate that firms
in countries with stronger corporate governance systems have a higher likelihood of purchasing
firms in other countries. The nationalities of owners and directors matter too. Ferreira et al. (2010)
find that foreign institutional owners facilitate cross-border acquisitions, and Masulis et al. (2012)
find that firms with foreign independent directors make better cross-border acquisitions when the
target firms are from the directors’ home economies.
But, researchers have not yet studied how the broad set of laws, regulations, and policies
that shape labor markets—“labor regulations”— influence cross-border acquisitions. Researchers
have dissected the impact of offshoring and multinational firms on wages and employment (e.g.,
Revenga 1992; Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008; Desai et al. 2009; and Harrison and
McMillan 2011). But, they have not evaluated whether differences in the degree to which
countries protect the employed and assist the unemployed influence cross-border acquisitions.
This is surprising. Besides influencing a large corporate expense—expenditures on wages
and benefits, labor regulations shape the costs of hiring, firing, and adjusting the hours of
workers, with potentially large effects on firm performance (Botero et al., 2004). Labor market
flexibility could be especially important for the success of acquisitions since acquiring firms
often restructure targets to minimize labor costs and maximize synergies. Thus, cross-country
!

differences in labor markets might influence cross-border acquisitions and the profitability of
those deals.
In this paper, we provide the first assessment of the relationship between cross-country
differences in labor regulations and cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Specifically, we
address the following questions: Are cross-country differences in labor regulations associated
with (1) how an acquiring firm’s stock price responds to a cross-border acquisition and (2) how
an acquiring firm’s profits change after a cross-border deal?
To address these questions, we use a sample of cross-border transactions in the Securities
Data Company database across 50 countries over the period from 1991 through 2012. This
includes transactions between 2,450 (=50! 49) country-pairs. We examine individual deals. We
assess the cumulative abnormal stock returns (CARs) and the abnormal return on assets (ROAs)
of acquiring firms following cross-border acquisitions. To calculate CARs, we follow Bris and
Cabolis (2008) and use a two-factor international market model in which one factor is the local
market returns and the second factor is the world market return. To compute abnormal ROA, we
follow Lin et al. (2011) and Harford et al. (2012) and adjust the firm’s ROAs by median industry
ROAs. Before the cross-border deal, we calculate the abnormal ROAs of the (artificially)
combined firm based on the relative sizes and industrial compositions of the two firms. After the
acquisition, we use the acquiring firm’s abnormal ROA.
We use three measures of labor regulations. First, Botero et al. (2004) provide crosscountry measures of the degree to which laws impede employers from firing workers, increasing
work hours, or using part-time workers. Such interventions increase the costs to employers of
adjusting their workforces. Second, the OECD provides panel measures of the strictness of
regulations on dismissals, including procedural inconveniences, notice and severance pay, and
the difficulty of firing workers. Third, Aleksynska and Schindler (2011) provide panel data on
the proportion of the unemployed covered by unemployment benefits. More generous
unemployment benefits might increase labor costs by boosting the reservation wages of the
unemployed. For brevity, we use the phrases “stronger” and “weaker” labor regulations to
!
!

#!

describe the degree to which laws and policies protect the employed and aid the unemployed.
With these data, we evaluate how an acquiring firm’s CAR and abnormal ROAs respond
to a cross-border acquisition. The key explanatory variable is the difference in labor regulations
between the countries of the target and acquirer. The regressions control for acquirer country,
target country, year, and acquirer industry fixed effects, and in those specifications where it is
feasible, we also include acquirer-target pair effects to control for all country-pair traits. We
control for deal-specific traits, geographic distance between the acquirer and target, as well as
time-varying country characteristics, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
We find a strong empirical connection between labor regulations and both abnormal
stock returns and profits. An acquirer’s CARs and abnormal ROAs respond more positively
when the target is in a country with weaker labor regulations than those of the acquiring firm.
The abnormal ROAs results are robust across the different measures of labor regulations and
specifications. The results on the relationship between CARs and the labor protection law index
are more fragile. As we now discuss, this fragility reflects weakness in precisely identifying
those target firms within a country that are likely to be most influenced by labor regulations and
those that are likely to be influenced least.
We extend these analyses by recognizing that labor regulations might differentially affect
firms. In particular, the success of firms in some industries might depend more on labor market
flexibility than the success of firms in other industries. If this is the case, then the stock market’s
reaction to a firm acquiring a target will be more sensitive to labor regulations when the target is
in an industry that relies heavily on labor market flexibility. Failure to account for these
differences might hinder the identification of the impact of differences in labor regulations on
acquirer CARs and abnormal ROAs.
Thus, we examine the relationship between labor regulations and changes in an acquiring
firm’s CAR and abnormal ROAs while differentiating by the degree to which the target is in a
“labor dependent industry,” an industry in which firm performance depends heavily on labor
markets. We use U.S. data to create two benchmark measures of the degree to which a firm is in
!
!

$!

a labor dependent industry: (1) “labor intensity” equals labor and pension expenses relative to
sales and (2) “labor volatility” equals the volatility of employment relative to assets. We then
redo the analyses of how an acquiring firm’s stock returns and profits respond to a cross-border
acquisition while further differentiating by the degree to which the target firm’s industry depends
on labor markets, as measured by labor intensity and labor volatility.
We find that the CARs and abnormal ROAs of acquiring firms respond most positively to
cross-border acquisitions of targets in countries with comparatively weak labor regulations when
the target is in a labor dependent industry. In turn, when the target is in an industry in which
labor regulations are unlikely to influence firm profitability, the stock market and profits do not
respond much to cross-border differences in labor regulations. The relationship between crossborder differences in regulation and acquirer CARs and abnormal ROAs is especially large when
theory suggests those differences should matter most—when the performance of the target
industry depends heavily on labor market flexibility.
We also extend these analyses by assessing the relationship between differences in labor
regulations and the number and value of cross-border acquisitions. If labor regulations shape the
stock price reaction to cross-border acquisitions and profitability of such deals, then this should
be reflected the incidence and size of cross-border acquisitions when differentiating by countrypairs. To check the consistency of our deal level analyses with firm-level decisions to engage in
cross-border mergers and acquisitions, we regress the number, value, and deal size of crossborder acquisitions on!the difference between labor regulations in the target and acquirer
countries. Besides conditioning on acquirer country, target country, and acquirer industry fixed
effects, we control for acquirer and target country characteristics, such as gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita and population, as well as acquirer-target traits, such as geographic distance
and whether they have the same major language and religion.
We find that a country’s firms acquire more firms and spend more on each acquisition in
a country if that target country has weaker labor regulations than the regulations in the acquirer
country. That is, firms find targets in countries with weaker labor regulations more appealing
!
!

%!

than similar targets in countries with comparatively strong labor regulations. For example, when
the target country has one-standard deviation lower labor protection laws than the median
country, our estimates suggest that the volume of cross border acquisitions will be almost 60%
higher. As another example, consider China, which has labor protections that are average in our
sample. About 67% of its cross-border acquisitions flow to countries with weak labor protection
laws (below the 25th percentile of the employment law distribution), while only 9% flow to
countries with strong labor protection laws (above the 75 percentile of the distribution). These
results are consistent with this paper’s core findings: acquiring firms enjoy larger CARs and
abnormal ROAs after a cross-border acquisition if the target is in a country with weaker labor
regulations than the acquirer country’s labor regulations.
It is important to be clear about what our analyses show and do not show. We do not, and
do not seek to, evaluate the impact of a random firm acquiring another random firm in a different
country in a random year on the CARs and abnormal ROAs of the acquiring firm. These
acquisition choices are anything but random. Rather, we evaluate what happens to CARs and
abnormal ROAs when a firm chooses to acquire another firm and whether this relationship
differs by the comparative labor regulations in the two countries and by the degree to which the
target firm is in an industry that requires flexible labor markets. We find that labor regulations
are powerfully associated with (a) stock price reactions to cross-border acquisitions, (b) the
abnormal ROAs of such deals, and (c) the degree to which firms in one country acquire firms in
other countries.
Our work relates to research on the role of labor in corporate decisions. Considerable
work shows that as labor and labor unions become more powerful, this influences corporate cash
holdings (Klasa et al., 2009), capital structure (Matsa 2010), tax aggressiveness (Chyz et al.,
2013), firm investments (Agrawal 2012, and Faleye, et al., 2006), and managerial performance
(Atanassov and Kim, 2009). Rather than focusing on how a firm’s labor unions alter its behavior,
we examine the association between cross-country differences in labor regulations and crossborder acquisition activity, the stock market response to such deals, and changes in the
!
!

&!

profitability of the acquiring firm after it makes the purchase. A notable paper is John, Knyazeva,
and Knyazeva (2014). Using a sample of U.S. publicly listed firms, they find that acquirers from
the states with strong labor rights experience on average 0.5% lower acquisition announcement
returns (i.e. 5 day CARs), which suggest the stakeholder-shareholder conflict of interest in
acquisition decision making. Moreover, they find that the acquirers from the strong labor rights
states are more likely to bid for targets in the strong labor rights states and with high labor costs.
In contrast, using a comprehensive sample of international data, we find that acquirers from
countries with strong labor regulations are more likely to acquire a target in a weak labor
regulation country. Moreover, we find that an acquirer’s CARs and abnormal ROAs respond
more positively when the target is in a country with weaker labor regulations than those of the
acquiring firm. These international evidence complements the U.S. evidence documented by
John et al., (2014).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the data.
We present the empirical analyses in section 3 and conclude in section 4.

2. Data, Summary Statistics, and Preliminaries
2.1 Labor regulations
We use three measures of the degree to which labor market laws, regulations, and
policies protect workers and aid the unemployed. First, Employment law measures the degree to
which laws, regulations, and policies impede employers from firing workers, increasing work
hours, or using part-time workers. Employment law was constructed by Botero et al. (2004) to
reflect the incremental cost to employers of deviating from a hypothetical rigid contract, in
which the conditions of employment are specified for all employees and no employee can be
fired. More specifically, Employment law is larger when it is more costly for employers to (1)
use alternative employment contracts, such as part-time employment, to avoid limits on
terminating workers or providing mandatory benefits; (2) increase the number of hours worked,
either because of limits on hours worked or because of mandatory overtime premia; and (3) to
!
!

'!

fire workers, where the costs reflect the notice period, severance pay, and any mandatory
penalties, as well as the costs associated with following the procedures associated with
dismissing workers. Thus, besides providing information on the degree to which laws protect
employees, Employment law is an index of the costs to firms of adjusting their labor forces.
Our second measure of labor protection is the employment protection law index (EPL),
which measures the costs and impediments to dismissing workers. EPL was compiled by the
OECD and incorporates three aspects of dismissal protection:1 (1) procedural impediments that
employers face when starting to fire workers, such as notification procedures and consultation
requirements; (2) the length of the notice period and the generosity of severance pay, which vary
by the tenure of workers; and (3) the difficulty of dismissal, as determined by the circumstances
in which it is possible to fire workers and the compensation and reinstatement possibilities
following unfair dismissal. This EPL index is measured annually, so it captures country-level
changes in employment protection. This allows us to control for acquirer-target fixed effects.
Third, Unemployment coverage equals the ratio of the number of recipients of
unemployment benefits to the number of unemployed and is from Aleksynska and Schindler
(2011). Unemployment coverage provides information on the generosity of unemployment
benefits. To the extent that such benefits increase the reservation wages of unemployed workers
and reduce the rate at which unemployed workers accept job offers, Unemployment coverage
provides information on the costs to firms of hiring workers. Since Unemployment coverage is
measured annually, we use it along with EPL to assess the time-series relationship between labor
protection policies and cross-border acquisitions. A disadvantage of Unemployment coverage is
that it only measures the proportion of unemployed workers who receive benefits; it does not
measure other factors that alter the costs to firms of changing labor contracts.
Panel B of Table 1 presents summary statistics of country and country-pair characteristics.
Unemployment coverage is 0.38, indicating that across all country-year observations

unemployment insurance recipients represent 38% of the unemployed. The average level of
Employment law and EPL is 0.48 and 2.19, respectively. Appendix 2 provides the values of
Employment law, EPL, and Unemployment coverage across countries.

2.2 Cross-Border acquisitions and firm performance
The Securities Data Company (SDC) database provides information on cross-border
acquisitions. Cross-border acquisitions include deals both announced and completed from 1991
through 2012, in which the acquirer and target firm can be publicly listed, privately owned, or a
subsidiary. Following Erel, Liao, and Weisbach (2012), we exclude leveraged buyouts, spinoffs,
recapitalizations, repurchases, self-tenders, exchange offers, privatizations, and transactions that
do not disclose the value of the deal.
After merging the SDC with the other data sources discussed below, we have a maximum
of 11,485 cross border deals in our regression analyses. There are 3,008 acquirers that make only
one cross-border acquisition during our sample period. There are 1,658 acquirers that make 2-4
cross-border deals and 509 acquirers that make five or more cross-border acquisitions.

2.2.1 Acquirer CARs
We use deal-level data to assess the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and abnormal
returns on assets (ROAs) of acquiring firms following cross-border acquisitions. Based on
Masulis, et al. (2007) and Ishii and Xuan (2014), we further restrict our definition of a crossborder acquisition in four ways. First, the cross-border deal must involve a!publicly listed
acquirer. Second, we only examine cases in which the acquirer obtains full control (100%
ownership of the target) and was not a majority stakeholder before the acquisition. Third, we
eliminate small deals (less than $1 million), since these might differ materially from the bulk of

!
!

)!

the sample. Fourth, we focus only on nonfinancial firms since financial firms are subject to a
wide array of regulatory restrictions on cross-border acquisitions.2
To calculate acquirer CARs around the acquisition announcement dates, we start with
stock price data from Datastream for non-U.S. firms and from CRSP for U.S. companies. We use
international exchange rates from Datastream to compute all returns in U.S. dollars. Thus, the
dollar-denominated daily return for firm i in country j on day t is

!!!!!! !

!!!!!! !

!!!!!!!! !

!
! !

! !!!

! !,

(1)

where Pi,j,t is the local currency stock price of firm i, in country j, on day t, and X($/j)t is the spot
exchange rate (dollars per local currency) on day t.
We then estimate CARs using the two-factor international market model, as in Bris and
Cabolis (2008). The two factors are the local market return and the world market return, where
these returns are computed in U.S. dollars. We use the broadest equity market index available for
each country to proxy for the local market return and the MSCI world index to proxy for the
world market return. Thus, we run the following regression:

!!!"# ! !! ! !!! !!"# ! !!! !!" ! !!" ,

(2)

where Rijt is the dollar-denominated daily stock return for firm i in country j, Rmjt is the local
market return in country j, and Rwt is the world market return. We estimate the model using 200
trading days from event day -210 to event day -11 and compute five-day CARs from the ε’s
during the event window (−2, +2), where event day 0 is the acquisition announcement date. Thus,
there is one CAR for each deal.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#

!The deal-level results are quite robust to alterations in these criteria. First, the results are robust to including
financial industry firms. Second, the results hold when defining an acquisition as obtaining a majority stake, rather
than defining an acquisition as when the acquiring firms holds 100% of the target’s shares after the transaction.

2.2.2 Acquire abnormal ROA
To measure the change in a firm’s performance when it acquires another firm, we
construct a measure of abnormal operating performance based each firm’s ROAs, which equals
net income divided by the book value of total assets at the beginning of the fiscal year. We then
calculate abnormal operating performance (industry-median-adjusted ROAs) before and after a
cross-border acquisition. The two-digit SIC industry codes are based on the self-reported main
industry classification of the firm. In pre-merger years, industry-median-adjusted ROAs equal
the weighted average of the acquirer and target’s ROAs minus the weighted average of their
respective industry-median ROAs. The weights are based on the market values of each firm in
the year before the acquisition (year -1). The industry classification is based on two-digit SIC
codes. In post-merger years (years +1, +2 and +3), industry-median-adjusted ROAs are the
merged firm’s ROAs minus the weighted average of the acquirer’s and targets industry-median
ROAs.
Specifically, pre-acquisition industry-median-adjusted ROA equals

(3)

while post-acquisition industry-median-adjusted ROA equals

!"#!"#$ ! !"#!!"# ! !! ! !"#!!"# ! !! !

(4)

The terms are defined as follows: !"#! is the acquirer’s ROAs; !"#! is the target’s ROAs;
!"#!!!"# is the acquirer’s industry-median ROAs; !"#!!!"# is the target’s industry-median
ROAs; !"#!"#$ is the merged firm’s ROAs; !! !is the weight of the acquirer firm; and !! !is the
weight of the target firm. The weights are the respective market value of the firm relative to the
market value of the combined firms in the year before the acquisition (year -1). Since (a) we only
!
!

"+!

have ROA for publicly-traded acquirers and targets and (b) the analyses of abnormal ROAs
require three years of data following the acquisition, the sample size drops appreciably from that
in the CAR analyses.

2.2.3 Deal-level and firm-level characteristics
The deal-level analyses control for firm-level and deal-level characteristics that past
researchers have used to explain firm performance and CARs (e.g., Masulis, et al. 2007). First,
we control for acquiring firm traits, such as firm size, cash flow, Tobin’s Q, and leverage, which
are obtained from Worldscope and Compustat. Second, we control for the acquiring firm’s preannouncement stock price run-up, which is measured as the acquirer’s market-adjusted buy-andhold return during the 200-day window from 210 days before the acquisition through 11 days
before the acquisition [-210, -11]. Third, we control for deal-level traits provided by SDC:
relative deal size equals the ratio of transaction value to the acquirer’s book value of total assets
in the fiscal year prior to the announcement date; industry relatedness equals one if the acquirer
and the target share a two-digit SIC industry classification; public target dummy, private target
dummy, and subsidiary target dummy equal one if the target is respectively a publicly-traded
parent company, privately-owned parent company, or a subsidiary firm; and, similarly, all cash
deal, friendly deal, and tender deal equal one respectively if the purchase is an all-cash deal, if
the target company’s board recommends the offer, and if the takeover bid is a public offer to
acquire a public firm’s shares made to equity holders during a specified time.
Panel A of Table 1 presents summary statistics for the 11,485 cross-border deals. The
five-day CAR is 1.31% across all cross-border acquisitions, suggesting that on average crossborder acquisitions enhance acquirer value. The average transaction value is 31.8% of the
acquiring firm’s total assets. The acquirer and target have different two-digit SIC industry codes
in 43% of the deals, which is reflected in the dummy variable Unrelated deal, and which is about
the same ratio as in domestic acquisitions. Publicly traded target firms account for about 10% of
!
!

""!

deals; thus, 90% of targets are privately held firms or subsidiaries of firms. We “winsorize”
continuous variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles. Furthermore, when we restrict the sample to
firms that do not conduct cross-border and domestic acquisitions within ten days of each other,
the results hold, yielding results that are similar both in terms of statistical significance and
economic magnitudes. Appendix 1 provides variable definitions. And Appendix 3 provides
information on the total number of cross-border deals for each acquirer country and target
country in our sample.

2.3 Cross-border acquisition activity and country and country-pair control variables
In extensions of our deal-level analyses of CARs and abnormal ROAs, we examine three
indicators of cross-border acquisition activity. Cross-border dollar volume measures the dollar
value of transactions and equals Log(1+ Value (a,t)), where Value (a,t) is the total dollar value of
all cross-border mergers during the sample period for acquirer firm a, with a target from country
t. Cross-border number measures the number of transactions and equals Log(1+ Number (a,t)),
where Number (a,t) is the total number of all cross-border mergers during the sample period for
acquirer firm a, with a target from country t. Cross-border deal size measures the average size of
transactions and equals!Log(1+ Deal size (a,t)), where Deal size (a,t) is the average dollar value
of all cross-border deals during the sample period for acquirer firm a, with a target from country
t.
Figures 1 – 4 provide illustrative patterns. Cross-border acquisitions are large, growing,
and represent an increasing proportion of the value of all mergers and acquisitions. As shown in
Figure 2, during the early part of the sample (1991-1997), cross-border acquisitions were
typically less than $300 billion per annum, but this rose to about $800 billion per annum after the
early 2000s. Furthermore, Figure 1 shows that the value of cross-border deals rose from about 25%
of all acquisitions during the early part of the sample (1991-1997) to around 35% since then.
Figure 3 documents the value of acquisitions for the eleven largest countries in terms of the total
value of cross-border acquisitions over the period from 1991 through 2012. The U.S. and U.K.
!
!

"#!

are the largest acquirers, with total values of over $2 trillion. Figure 4 shows that a larger volume
of acquisitions involves targets in countries with weaker labor regulations than targets in
countries with stronger labor regulations than the acquirer country.
We also include data on country traits that have been used to explore the determinants of
cross-border acquisitions. First, considerable research indicates that geographic and cultural
proximity facilitate communication, deal-making, and hence cross-border acquisitions, as shown
in Erel et al. 2012. Consequently, we include three variables to capture these traits: (a) the
natural logarithm of the distance between the capitals of the acquirer and target countries,
Log[Geographic distance]; (b) an indicator variable that equals one if the acquirer and the target
have the same primary language (Same language); and (c) an indicator variable that equals one
if they have the same primary religion (Same religion). Second, we include Log[GDP per capita]
and Log[Population] to measure the level of economic development and size of the population
respectively. Third, since other country traits might influence the costs and benefits of crossborder transactions, we include acquirer and target country fixed effects, and in some analyses,
we include acquirer-target fixed effects. In Panel B of Table 1, we observe that 4% of countrypairs share the same language and about 20% of country-pairs share the same religion.

2.4 Preliminaries: Do cross-border acquisitions predict changes in labor regulations?
In this research, we seek to assess (1) whether the stock market response to a firm making
a cross-border acquisition differs depending on the comparative strength of labor regulations
between the acquiring and target countries, and (2) whether the change in the operating
performance of the acquiring firm depends on the differences in labor regulations in the
acquiring and target countries. If acquisition activity triggers changes in labor regulations,
however, this would complicate our ability to draw confident inferences about the impact of
comparative labor regulations on cross-border deals.
Thus, we assess the degree to which acquisition activity forecasts changes in labor
regulations. We regress changes in Unemployment coverage (∆Unemployment coverage) and
!
!

"$!

changes in EPL (∆EPL) between period t-1 and t on the average value of cross-border
acquisitions between period t-4 and t-1 (Cross-border dollar volume_3y). We also control for
lagged values of Unemployment coverage (EPL), measures of economic and institutional
development, as well as year fixed effects. Data permitting, the regressions include 50 countries
over the period from 1993 to 2012.
As shown in Table 2, there is no evidence that cross-border acquisition activity accounts
for changes in labor regulations. Indeed, the t-statistics on cross-border volume during the
previous three years are less than one in the regressions. The weakness of this relationship holds
when altering the conditioning information set. For example, the t-statistics remain less than one
when omitting the lagged labor regulation regressors or when omitting GDP growth. While these
results do not establish that labor regulations are exogenous, they do indicate that the value of
cross-border acquisitions is not strongly related to future changes in labor laws.

3. Empirical results !
This section examines the relationship between labor regulations and (1) acquirer CARs
around the announcement of an acquisition and (2) acquirer abnormal ROAs following crossborder acquisitions. In these analyses, we also test whether comparative labor regulations exert a
particularly pronounced effect on acquirer CARs and abnormal ROAs when the target firm is in
an industry in which labor flexibility is relatively important. If labor flexibility is especially
important for the success of some firms and stronger labor protection laws impede labor
flexibility, then an acquirer’s CARs and abnormal ROAs should be more sensitive to the target
country’s labor protection laws when the target is in an industry that relies heavily on labor
flexibility. In turn, if labor flexibility is relatively unimportant for a target firm’s success, then
labor regulations should be comparatively less important in shaping the acquirer’s CARs and
abnormal ROAs. We begin with baseline regressions that do not distinguish targets by industry
and then differentiate firms by their dependence on labor flexibility.

(Unemployment coverage, Employment law, or EPL) between the target and acquiring firm
countries, Dd, Ad, and Cd are deal, acquiring firm, and country characteristics for countries of the
acquiring and target firms respectively, δa, δt, δy, and δat are fixed effects for the country of the
acquiring firm (a), the country of the target firm (t), the year (y), and acquirer-target country
fixed effects (at), and ud is the error term for deal d. To isolate the relationship between CAR
and labor regulation differences, we control for deal (Dd), acquirer (Ad), and country traits (Cd)
that past researchers have shown help explain acquisition announcement returns (e.g. Fuller,
Netter and Stegemoller, 2002; Masulis, Wang, and Xie, 2007). These controls were discussed in
Section 2 and are more completely defined in Appendix 1. We can control for acquirer-target
country fixed effects (δat), and therefore control for all country-pair traits, when (a) firms from
the acquiring country acquire firms from the target country in different years and (b) Labor
Regulation[t-a] varies over time.
The results in Table 3 indicate that cumulative abnormal returns are materially smaller
when an acquiring firm announces the purchase of a target firm in a country with more generous
labor policies, as measured by Unemployment coverage, than the acquirer’s home country. That
is, the market tends to respond more favorably when a firm acquires a target in an economy in
which unemployment benefits cover a smaller proportion of uninsured workers. More
specifically, column (1) includes all of the control variables except country-level fixed effects;
column (4) also includes acquirer and target country effects; and column (7) includes acquirer!

"&!

target fixed. Unemployment coverage enters all regressions negatively and significantly at the
five percent level. In terms of economic size, the estimate in column (7) suggests that when an
acquirer purchases a target in an economy with a one standard deviation larger value of
Unemployment coverage (0.42) than the value of its home country, its CAR will be about 0.34
(=0.42*(-0.804)) smaller than if the target is in a country with the same Unemployment coverage.
Figures 5a and 5b illustrate these findings: CARs tend to be larger when the target is in a country
with weaker labor regulations than the labor regulations in the acquiring firm’s home country.
The control variables enter the CARs regressions in a manner that is consistent with
previous studies of cross-border acquisitions. For example, we find that large acquirers have
lower abnormal returns and acquisitions involving large targets (relative deal size) have higher
abnormal returns. We also confirm that announcement returns are significantly lower for
acquirers that experience a rapid pre-announcement rise in stock prices (Stock runup). In
addition, we find that acquisitions of private or subsidiary targets are associated with higher
announcement returns, while acquisitions of public targets are associated with lower
announcement returns.
The baseline results on Employment law and EPL are not as strong. In particular, while
Employment law enters the CARs regression significantly at the one percent level when we do
not include country fixed effects (column 2), the estimate becomes insignificant when including
dummy variables for the acquiring and target countries in column (4). With respect to EPL,
Table 3 indicates that coefficient estimate on EPL is negative and statistically significant at the 1%
level when we include all of the control variables except country fixed effects. However, the
estimate becomes insignificant when we include country-level fixed effects. Since the EPL
measure captures some country-level changes in dismissal protection, we include the countrypair fixed effects in column (8) and find that EPL enters the CAR regression significantly at the
ten percent level.
One possible explanation for the weaker results on Employment law and EPL is that labor
protection laws primarily influence the CARs of the acquirer when the target’s profitability relies
!
!

"'!

heavily on the flexibility of labor markets. Perhaps, by failing to distinguish target firms by the
degree to which they benefit from the flexibility of labor markets, we have not identified the key
mechanism linking the stock market’s response to cross-border acquisitions and labor regulations.

3.2. Labor regulations and CARs: The target’s labor intensity and volatility
We now reassess the relationship between acquirer firm CARs and labor regulations
while differentiating by the degree to which the target firm is in an industry whose performance
is likely to depend heavily on labor regulations. To measure the degree to which an industry (3digit SIC code) is likely to depend heavily on labor regulations, we construct and use two
benchmark indicators of labor dependence based on U.S. data: (1) Labor intensity equals one if
the target industry’s average ratio of labor and pension expenses to sales is greater than the
sample median and zero otherwise; and (2) Labor volatility equals one if the target industry’s
average ratio of the standard deviation of the number of employees relative to the value of PPE
assets (plant, property, and equipment) is greater than the sample median and zero otherwise.
That is, using the U.S. economy to benchmark industries, we construct these two proxies of the
degree to which the performance of firms in a particular industry depends heavily on labor
market flexibility. If the difference in labor regulations between acquirer and target countries
materially influences the stock market’s reaction to a cross-border acquisitions, then we should
discover that acquirer CARs are particularly responsive when the target is in a labor intensive
industry or an industry that has comparatively volatile demand for labor.
More specifically, we modify equation (5) to allow for the relationship between CARs
and labor regulation differences to vary with the degree to which the target is in a labor
dependent industry:

CARd = β0 + β1Labor Regulation[t-a]d + β2Labor Regulation[t-a]d*Labor Dependence[t]d +

!

+ β3Dd + β4Ad + β5Cd + δa + δt + δy (+ δat) + ud,

(6)

!

"(!

where Labor Dependence[t]d is one of the proxies—Labor intensive or high labor volatility—
of the degree to which the industry of the target firm depends on labor market flexibility for its
success and the other variables are the same as those used in equation (5). In Table 4, Panel A
presents the results when interacting Labor intensive with Unemployment coverage, Employment
law and EPL respectively, while Panel B presents the results when interacting High labor
volatility with Unemployment coverage, Employment law and EPL respectively.
We find that the sensitivity of acquirer announcement returns to differences in labor
regulations is much larger for targets in labor dependent industries. Consider first the
Unemployment coverage results, which Table 4 provides in columns (1) and (4) in both Panel A
and B. The difference between Unemployment coverage in the target and acquirer country enters
negatively and significantly in both the Labor intensive and high labor volatility regressions.
Moreover, the coefficients on the interaction terms enter negatively and significantly, at the 10%
level for the interaction between Unemployment coverage and Labor intensive (column 1, panel
A) and at the 1% level for the interaction between Unemployment coverage and High labor
volatility (Column 1, Panel B). After controlling for the country pair fixed effects, we continue to
find a 1% significance level for the interaction between Unemployment coverage and High labor
volatility (Column 4, Panel B).
The economic impact is large: the estimated increase in an acquirer’s CARs for
purchasing a target in an economy with lower Unemployment coverage than its home country is
twice as large when the target is in a comparatively high volatility industry than when the target
is in a low volatility industry in the same target country. For example, consider a Swedish firm
(Sweden has an average value of Unemployment coverage of 0.796) acquiring a target firm in
the United States (which has an average value of Unemployment coverage of 0.362). The
estimates from Table 4 indicate that if the target is in the computer programming service industry
(SIC 737), which is a comparatively high labor-volatility industry, the additional increase in the
acquiring firm’s CAR (above the average increase) will be 0.61% (=(0.796-0.362) *
(0.660+0.757)). However, if the target is in the dairy products industry (SIC 202), which is a low
!
!

")!

labor-volatility industry, the corresponding additional boost in CAR (above the average increase
associated with an acquisition) will be 0.29% (=(0.796-0.362)*0.660). Given that the average
CAR is 1.3%, the difference is economically significant.
In assessing the relationship between the CAR of cross-border acquisitions and labor
regulations, we find that it is especially important to differentiate targets in high and low labor
dependent industries when considering the Employment law and EPL proxies of labor regulations.
As shown in Table 4, the interaction terms between Employment law and both labor intensive
and high labor volatility enter negatively and significantly. The stock market responds positively
when an acquiring firm purchases a target in an economy with weaker labor protection laws
when the target firm is in an industry in which labor protection laws are likely to exert a
pronounced effect on its performance. For EPL, the interaction terms between EPL and both
labor intensive and high labor volatility enter negatively and significantly (at the 1% level and 5%
level, respectively). After controlling for country pair fixed effects, we continue to find
significant interaction terms between EPL and both labor intensive and high labor volatility
(column 5, Panel A and B). Overall, these results indicate that the sensitivities of CARs to
differences in labor regulations are larger for targets in labor dependent industries.
That is, the CARs of acquiring firms respond most strongly to cross-border acquisitions
when the target is in an industry and a country in which theories focusing on the importance of
labor regulations predict markets will be most sensitive. The economic impact is large. For
example, consider a firm in Germany (which has a value of Employment law of 0.702) acquiring
a target in Malaysia (which has a value of Employment law of 0.189). The estimates suggest that
acquirer CARs will rise by 0.44% (= (0.702-0.189)*0.864) more if the target firm is in a highvolatility industry than if the same acquirer purchases a target in Malaysia but in a low-volatility
industry.

3.3. Labor market regulations and ROA: Simple comparisons
Having shown that stock prices respond more favorably to the cross-border acquisition of
!
!

"*!

firms in target countries with weak labor protection laws, especially if those firms are in labor
intensive industries or industries with high labor volatility, we now examine firm performance.
We examine whether the abnormal ROAs of an acquiring firm varies negatively with the
comparative strength of labor regulations in the target and acquiring countries. Furthermore, we
assess whether the relationship between acquiring firm abnormal ROAs and the target-acquirer
difference in the strength of labor regulations varies by the industry of the target firm.
We use two methods to evaluate whether acquiring firm performance following a crossborder acquisition depends on the comparative strength of labor regulations in the target and
acquiring country. The first method simply examines changes in the abnormal ROAs of the
acquiring firm around cross-border acquisitions. In particular, we partition the sample into “T <
A” and “T > A” groups, where “T < A” means that the target country has weaker labor
regulations than the acquirer’s country, and “T > A” means that the target country has stronger
labor regulations than the acquirer’s country. We continue to use three measures of labor
regulations: Unemployment coverage, Employment law and EPL. We then compute for each of
these measures of labor regulations the change in abnormal ROA of the acquiring firm following
the acquisition announcement. We first present and discuss the results using this first method and
then describe the second method for examining abnormal ROAs and present those findings.
As shown in Table 5, abnormal firm performance— the average industry-medianadjusted ROAs—for the “T > A” group drops significantly after cross-border acquisitions, but
abnormal firm performance does not drop for the “T < A” group. The post-acquisition 3-year
median abnormal ROAs is significantly below the year -1 abnormal ROA for cross-border deals
involving targets from countries with relatively protective labor regulations and unemployment
benefits that cover a large proportion of the unemployed. In contrast, there is no significant
change in abnormal operating performance for deals in the “T < A” group. The tests of
significance for the post-acquisition 3-year median abnormal ROAs are conducted using a null

!
!

#+!

hypothesis of zero change in abnormal ROA.3 These results are consistent with the view that
stronger labor regulations in the target country make post-merger integration more costly and
reduce the manifestation of synergies in the acquirer’s ROAs. For instance, if a firm from the
U.S. (which has weak labor regulations) acquires a firm in France (which has strong labor
regulations), then “T>A” for Employment law. The regression estimates then predict a decrease
in abnormal ROA of 0.0255 from the pre-acquisition period to the post-acquisition 3-year
median abnormal ROA. The estimate suggests that the post-acquisition abnormal ROA is 26.8%
(=100*0.0255/0.0953) lower than its pre-acquisition value average.
Table 6 extends these analyses by further differentiating by the industry of the target firm.
In addition to examining abnormal firm performance when differentiating between cross-border
acquisitions when the target country has stronger labor regulations than the acquiring country (T >
A) or weaker labor regulations (T < A), we now differentiate by whether the target firm is in a
labor dependent industry as measured by labor intensity or labor volatility. As in the analyses of
acquirer CARs, this further cutting of the data provides a precise identification of whether crosscountry differences in labor regulations influence an acquiring firm’s performance in manner that
is consistent with the predictions emerging from several theories discussed in the Introduction.
As shown in Table 6, the abnormal ROAs of the acquiring firm perform much worse
when the target is in a country with stronger labor protection laws and more expansive
unemployment benefits than those in acquiring firm’s home country, and these findings are
driven by target firms in labor intensive industries or industries with high labor volatility. In
particular, Table 6 shows that when either Unemployment coverage, Employment law, and EPL
are greater for the target country than the acquirer, abnormal ROAs of the acquirer are
significantly smaller when the target is in either a labor intensive industry or an high labor
volatility industry than when the target is in the same country but is not in a labor intensive or
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$

!When we test the differences between the T>A and T<A groups, we find that abnormal operating performance are
not significantly different for the Unemployment coverage analyses, but are significantly different at the 10% level
for the Employment law and EPL analyses. As shown in Table 6, these differences become more distinct when
differentiating by the labor dependence of the target firm.!

high labor volatility industry. It is the combination of target country’s labor regulations/policies
and the degree to which the target firm is in a labor intensive or high labor volatility industry that
drives the acquiring firm’s response, as measured by abnormal ROAs, to the cross-border deal.

3.4. Labor market regulations and ROA: Regression analyses
The second method for assessing abnormal operating performance employs a regression
framework based on Healy, Palepu and Ruback (1992) and controls for deal and firm
characteristics. The dependent variable is the abnormal ROAs of the acquiring firm during the
three years following the acquisition, so that there is one observation per deal. Following Healy,
Palepu and Ruback (1992), the regression controls for the combined acquirer-target abnormal
ROAs in the year before the acquisition, i.e., pre-acquisition industry-median-adjusted ROA
defined in equation (3) above. The regression also controls for Log [Total Assets], which is the
natural logarithm of the book value of the assets of the acquiring firm (in millions of U.S. dollars)
in the year before the acquisition, Tobin’s Q, which is the market value of total assets divided by
the book value of total assets of the acquiring firm in the year before the acquisition; and two
dummy variables defining the nature of the acquisition Unrelated deal, which indicates whether
the deal involves distinct industries, and Friendly deal, which indicates whether the acquisition is
friendly.
The estimated coefficient on the intercept represents the conditional average change in
abnormal operating performance following cross-border mergers. We provide these regressions
separately for targets from countries with higher labor regulation (Unemployment coverage,
Employment law, and EPL) values than those in acquirer countries and targets from countries
with less protective labor regulations than those in acquirer countries.
The regression results from this second method indicate that acquirers that purchase
targets in countries with stronger labor protection regulations than their own country’s labor
regulations tend to suffer worse performance following the deal. The results in Table 7 indicate
that acquirer abnormal ROA falls when the target is in a country with more protective labor laws
!
!

##!

and more expansive unemployment benefits coverage. As shown, the estimated intercept is
negative and statistically significant for all the “T > A” groups and insignificant for all the “T <
A” groups. These results imply that acquirers from countries with weaker labor regulations
experience significantly worse operating performance following cross-border acquisitions, while
acquirers from countries with stronger labor regulations do not. Firm performance tends to drop
following cross-border deals in which the target is in a country with more generous
unemployment benefits and stronger employment laws.
In Table 8, we extend these results and further differentiate by deals by whether the target
is in a labor dependent industry. The results are again striking. All of the estimated reduction in
abnormal ROAs from the acquisition of a firm in a country with strong labor protection policies
emerges from the purchase of firms in labor intensive and high labor volatility industries. Put
differently, the positive synergies from the cross-border acquisition of a firm in a country with
weaker labor protection laws and less expansive unemployment benefits are largely due to the
purchase of target firms in industries that rely heavily on flexible labor markets, such as labor
intensive industries and industries in which labor fluctuates relatively severely.

3.5. A check: The number, volume, and size of cross-border acquisitions
We now check whether our findings on CARs and ROAs are consistent with a firm’s
decisions regarding whether and where to engage in cross-border acquisitions. If labor
regulations shape the stock price reaction to cross-border acquisitions and profitability of such
deals, then this should be reflected the incidence and size of cross-border acquisitions when
differentiating country-pairs by labor regulations. To check the consistency of our deal level
analyses with firm-level decisions to undertake cross-border mergers and acquisitions, we
regress the number, value, and deal size of cross-border acquisitions on!the difference between
labor regulations in the target and acquirer countries, while controlling for an assortment of firms,
country, and country-pair characteristics.

!
!

#$!

We augment the standard gravity model of cross-border mergers and acquisition activity
to assess the relationship between labor market regulations and the number, volume, and size of
cross-border acquisitions. Our sample consists of public acquirers that consummate at least five
cross-border deals during our sample period. We consider every possible target country into
which these acquiring firms might choose to make an acquisition. Thus, the unit of analysis is an
acquiring firm (a) and its (potential) acquisition of firms in each target country (t). If a firm does
not acquire a target in a specific country, we assign a zero for number and value in acquisitions
to that country.
We estimate the following equation

yat = β0 + β1Labor Regulation[t-a]at + β3Dat + β4Aa + δa + δt + δi + eat,

(7)

where the dependent variable, yat, is either Log(1+ Number (a,t)), Log(1+ Value (a,t)), or
Log(1+ Deal (a,t)); where Number (a,t), Value (a,t), and Deal (a,t) equal total number, total
dollar value, and average deal size of cross-border deals between acquiring firm a and firms in a
target country (t); Labor Regulation[t-a]at is the difference in labor regulations between the
countries of the target and acquiring firms (Unemployment coverage, Employment law, and EPL);
Aat represents information about the acquiring firms, such as firm size; and δa, δt, and δi are fixed
effects for the acquiring country, the target country, and the industry of the acquiring firm
respectively. For each acquiring firm, we use the average annual values for the full sample
period (1991-2012) for all time-variant variables.
As shown in Table 9, a country’s firms acquire more firms and spend more on
acquisitions in another country if that target country’s labor regulations are relatively less
protective of labor. In particular, the first three columns present OLS regressions in which the
dependent variable is Log(1+ Number (a,t)), the next three present regressions in which the
dependent variable is Log(1+ Value (a,t)), and the final three present regressions in which the
dependent variable is Log(1+ Deal (a,t)). Across all nine specifications, the estimated
!
!

#%!

coefficients on labor market regulation differences are negative and statistically significant.
These results imply that, the number and volume of cross-border acquisitions are lower when
targets are in countries with greater Unemployment coverage, Employment law, and EPL values
than the regulations in the acquirer country. Consistent with our findings that stock returns and
profits rise more when the acquiring firm’s country has more protective labor regulations than
the target’s country, we also find that comparative labor regulations are closely linked with
cross-border acquisition activity.
The relationship between labor regulation differences and cross-border acquisition flows
is economically large. Two examples illustrate the economic magnitudes from estimates in Table
9. First, consider a target country that has a one standard deviation lower value of Employment
law than the acquirer (0.18). The estimates indicate that Value (a,t)) will be about 69%
(=0.18*3.82) larger than when the two economies have the same labor protection laws. Second,
consider France, which is at the 90th percentile of the Employment law distribution (e.g.,
France’s Employment law index equals 0.744). From the regression estimates in Table 9, we can
compute the drop in foreign firm acquisitions of French companies due to its comparatively
strong labor protection laws, where the average country has an employment law index of 0.478.
The estimates suggest that relative to an average country, France is associated with 102% (=
(0.744-0.478)*3.82 lower foreign capital inflows from cross-border acquisitions due to its
comparatively strong labor regulations. For countries at the 75th percentile of the Employment
law distribution (e.g., Italy, has an employment law index of 0.65), they are associated with 66%
(= (0.65-0.478)*3.82) less foreign capital inflows from cross-border acquisitions due to their
labor regulations.
We also explore whether differences in labor regulation between acquirer country and
target country operate at the intensive margin, the extensive margin, or both. That is, we examine
whether differences in labor regulations shape average deal size. As shown in the last three
columns of Table 9, labor regulations operate on both margins. The average deal size of crossborder acquisitions tends to be smaller when targets are in countries with stronger labor
!
!

#&!

protection laws than the regulations in the acquirer country. Stronger labor regulations in a
country reduce the dollar value, the number, and the average size of acquisitions by foreign firms
in that country.

5. Conclusion
Using a comprehensive sample of cross-border acquisitions from 50 countries occurring
from 1991 through 2012, we discover that cross-country differences in labor market regulations
help account for (1) the stock price response of the acquiring firm to a cross-border deal and (2)
the change in the operating performance of the acquiring firm after it makes a cross-border
acquisition. Specifically, the abnormal stock returns and profits of acquiring firms increase more
when the target country has weaker labor protection laws.
These effects are more pronounced when the target firm is in an industry that relies
heavily on flexible labor markets for its performance. In particular, when the target firm is in an
industry in which labor costs account for a large fraction of total costs or an industry in which the
volatility of employment is relatively high, the results suggest that the impact of comparative
labor regulations on both abnormal stock returns and profits is much larger. The results are
consistent with the view the broad array of labor laws, regulations, and policies that shape the
operation of labor markets materially shape the direction, performance, and synergies of crossborder acquisitions. As a check, we also find that the number, volume, and deal size of crossborder acquisitions are significantly lower when target countries have stronger labor regulations.

Table 2
The validity test: impact of historical cross-border acquisition volume on labor regulation change
This table reports the validity test of using labor market regulations to explain cross-border acquisition
volume. Specifically, we examine the effect of cross-border acquisition volume on the change of labor
regulations for target countries during our sample period. The dependent variables are unemployment
benefits coverage change (∆Unemployment coverage) in Columns (1)-(3) and EPL change (∆EPL) in
Columns (4)-(6). Cross-border dollar volume_3y is the annual average dollar volume of cross-border
acquisitions that occurred in the target country during the past three years. Heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors are reported in brackets. The coefficient on the constant is suppressed for brevity. *, **,
and *** represent statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

This table reports the results of OLS regressions of the effect of labor protection on acquirer abnormal announcement returns. The dependent
variable is the acquirer’s five-day CAR (-2, +2). Unemployment coverage is unemployment benefits coverage, which is calculated as the ratio of
the number of UI (unemployment insurance) benefit recipients to the number of unemployed. Unemployment coverage_[t-a] is the difference
between the unemployment benefits coverage for the target and acquirer countries. Employment law is employment laws index, which measures
the protection of the individual employment contract (Botero et al., 2004). Employment law_[t-a] is the difference between the employment laws
index for the target and acquirer countries. EPL is employment protection laws index, which measures the strictness of employment protection
against individual dismissal (compiled by the OECD). EPL_[t-a] is the difference between the OECD employment protection index for the target
and acquirer countries. All variables are defined in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered at the acquirer country
level are reported in brackets. The coefficient on the constant is suppressed for brevity. *, **, and *** represent statistical significance at the 10%,
5%, and 1% level, respectively.

We calculate labor intensity as the ratio of labor and pension expenses to sales. Labor volatility is defined as the standard deviation of the number
of employees scaled by PPE (plant, property, and equipment). High labor volatility is an indicator variable that equals one if target industry’s
average labor volatility is above sample median. All variables are defined in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered
at the acquirer country level are reported in brackets. The coefficient on the constant is suppressed for brevity. *, **, and *** represent statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

Table 5
Pre- and post-acquisition abnormal operating performance

This table reports average industry-median-adjusted operating performance around cross-border merge
for deals that the acquirer country labor protection is stronger than the target country and deals that the
acquirer country labor protection is weaker than the target country (Panel A presents summary statistic
and Panel B presents industry-adjusted ROA for “T < A” and “T > A”). Year 0 is the year in which the
acquisition is completed. ROA is net income divided by the book value of total assets at the beginning
the fiscal year. In pre-merger years, industry-median-adjusted ROA is calculated as the weighted avera
of the acquirer’s and target’s operating performance minus the weighted average of the industry-media
operating performance using the acquirer’s and target’s industry. The weights are based on the market
value of total assets of each firm at the year -1. In post-merger years, industry-median-adjusted ROA is
the merged firm’s operating performance minus the weighted average of the acquirer’s and target’s
industry-median operating performance. Industry classification is based on two-digit SIC codes.!
Unemployment coverage is unemployment benefits coverage, which is calculated as the ratio of the
number of UI (unemployment insurance) benefit recipients to the number of unemployed. Employmen
law is employment laws index, which measures the protection of the individual employment contract
(Botero et al., 2004). EPL is employment protection laws index, which measures the strictness of
employment protection against individual dismissal (compiled by the OECD). *, **, and *** represent
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

Pre- and post-acquisition abnormal operating performance: labor intensity and labor volatility
This table reports average industry-median-adjusted operating performance around cross-border mergers
for deals that the acquirer country labor protection is weaker than the target country. Year 0 is the year in
which the acquisition is completed. ROA is net income divided by the book value of total assets at the
beginning of the fiscal year. In pre-merger years, industry-median-adjusted ROA is calculated as the
weighted average of the acquirer’s and target’s operating performance minus the weighted average of the
industry-median operating performance using the acquirer’s and target’s industry. The weights are based
on the market value of total assets of each firm at the year -1. In post-merger years, industry-medianadjusted ROA is the merged firm’s operating performance minus the weighted average of the acquirer’s
and target’s industry-median operating performance. Industry classification is based on two-digit SIC
codes.!Unemployment coverage is unemployment benefits coverage, which is calculated as the ratio of
the number of UI (unemployment insurance) benefit recipients to the number of unemployed.
Employment law is employment laws index, which measures the protection of the individual employment
contract (Botero et al., 2004). EPL is employment protection laws index, which measures the strictness of
employment protection against individual dismissal (compiled by the OECD). Labor intensity is defined
as the ratio of labor and pension expenses to sales. Labor volatility is defined as the standard deviation of
the number of employees scaled by PPE (plant, property, and equipment). In Panel A, the subsamples are
formed based on whether target industry’s average labor intensity is above or below sample median. In
Panel B, the subsamples are formed based on whether target industry’s average labor volatility is above or

Table 9
The determinants of cross-border mergers: firm-level analysis
This table reports OLS analysis of the determinants of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. The sample
includes public acquirer firms which consummate at least five cross-border deals during our sample
period (1991-2012).The dependent variables are Log(1+ Number (a,t)) in Columns (1)-(3), Log(1+ Value
(a,t)) in Columns (4)-(6) and Log(1+ Deal size (a,t)) in Columns (7)-(9). Number (a,t) is the total number
of all cross-border mergers during the sample period for acquirer firm a, with the target from country t.
Value (a,t) is the total dollar value of all cross-border mergers during the sample period for acquirer firm
a, with the target from country t. Deal size (a,t) is the average dollar value of all cross-border deals during
the sample period for acquirer firm a, with the target from country t. Unemployment coverage is
unemployment benefits coverage, which is calculated as the ratio of the number of UI (unemployment
insurance) benefit recipients to the number of unemployed. Unemployment coverage_[t-a] is the
difference between the unemployment benefits coverage for the target and acquirer countries.
Employment law is employment laws index, which measures the protection of the individual employment
contract (Botero et al., 2004). Employment law_[t-a] is the difference between the employment laws
index for the target and acquirer countries. EPL is employment protection laws index, which measures the
strictness of employment protection against individual dismissal (compiled by the OECD). EPL_[t-a] is
the difference between the OECD employment protection index for the target and acquirer countries. All
variables are defined in the Appendix. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors clustered at the
acquirer country level are reported in brackets. The coefficient on the constant is suppressed for brevity. *,
**, and *** represent statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

In this figure, weak labor protection laws represent countries with below the 25th percentile of the employment law distribution, and strong labor
protection laws represent countries with above the 75th percentile of the employment law distribution. This figure illustrates this information for
the top eleven acquirer countries in terms of cross-border deal value over the entire sample period (1991-2012).

This figure show the average acquirer cumulative abnormal returns (%) from day -2 to day +2 around the acquisition announcement (zero is the
acquisition announcement date). A>T represents observations with relatively higher employment law for acquirer country, while A<T represents
observations with relatively higher employment law for target country.

This figure shows the average residuals of acquirer cumulative abnormal returns (%) from day -2 to day +2 around the acquisition announcement
(zero is the acquisition announcement date). The residuals (CAR-R) are calculated from regression model (2) in Table 3, but exclude the labor
regulation variables. A>T represents observations with relatively higher employment law for acquirer country, while A<T represents observations
with relatively higher employment law for target country.
