ABSTRACT
Unlike performance incentives for private sector managers, little is known about performance
incentives for managers in public sector bureaucracies. Through a randomized trial in rural China,
we study performance incentives rewarding school administrators for reducing student anemia—
as well as complementarity between incentives and orthogonally assigned discretionary
resources. Large (but not small) incentives and unrestricted grants both reduced anemia, but
incentives were more cost-effective. Although unrestricted grants and small incentives do not
interact, grants fully crowd-out the effect of larger incentives. Our findings suggest that
performance incentives can be effective in bureaucratic environments, but they are not
complementary to discretionary resources.

1. Introduction
The provision of public services in many developing countries is low in quality
(World Bank 2004; Banerjee, Deaton, and Duflo 2004; Das, Hammer, and Leonard 2008;
Berendes et al. 2011). Although the underlying reasons are complex and incompletely
understood, the culprit is not simply lack of resources, inadequate training, or
deficiencies in provider knowledge. Supply-side incentives are also often poorly aligned
with social objectives. Absenteeism in many parts of the world is pervasive (Chaudhury
and Hammer 2004; Kremer et al. 2005; Chaudhury et al. 2006; Lewis 2006; Banerjee and
Duflo 2006), and providers often fail to do in practice what is within their knowledge and
means (Das and Hammer 2004; Alcázar et al. 2006; Chaudhury et al. 2006; Das and
Hammer 2007; Leonard and Masatu 2010; Das et al. 2012; Sylvia et al. 2015).
To better align provider incentives with social objectives, performance pay has
become increasingly common in public sector service delivery (Oxman and Fretheim
2008; Eichler and Levine 2009; Miller and Babiarz 2014). Drawing on the logic of
performance pay in human resource management (Lazear 1995; Hall and Liebman 1998;
Lazear 2000), this approach provides direct financial rewards for achieving pre-specified
performance targets. Despite its growing prominence, however, there is remarkably little
empirical evidence on basic mechanism design considerations in the use of performance
pay to improve public service delivery (Miller and Babiarz 2014).
This paper contributes to the literature on performance pay in developing
countries – and in particular, its design – through a large-scale experiment studying the
interaction of performance incentives and unconditional block grants, both of varying

1

sizes, for public sector administrators. Specifically, we provide primary school
administrators (lead principals who are the managers and executive decision-makers in
schools – hereafter “administrators”) with randomly assigned budget transfers (large and
small) and randomly assigned financial incentives (large and small) for improving the
health of their students. Our health focus is anemia, a leading child health problem in
rural China.2
Our study yields four key findings. First, we find that larger incentives for anemia
reduction were effective when administrators had fewer resources at their disposal for
implementing the program. Incentives that provided substantial additional income to
administrators (mean realized payouts of about 2 months of annual salary) reduced
anemia among students who were anemic at baseline by 13.8 percentage points (or 38%).
Second, in contrast, small incentives (one tenth the size of the larger incentives) were
ineffective in reducing anemia – and were significantly less effective than large
incentives. Third, even absent explicit incentives, unrestricted budget transfers to school
administrators led to sizeable reductions in anemia, suggesting other motives among
administrators to allocate resources towards student nutrition. However, the resource cost
of reducing anemia through larger school budgets was approximately twice as great (per
case of anemia averted) as combining larger performance incentives with smaller budgets
– implying that school administrators with explicit financial incentives used smaller
budgets with greater productive efficiency.
Finally, we find that explicit financial incentives and unrestricted grants can be
strong substitutes – and whether or not they are depends critically on incentive size.

2

Previous studies have shown anemia rates among primary school aged students in poor regions of western
China to be around 30% on average (Luo et al. 2011; Miller et al. 2012).
2

Specifically, we find that large incentives and grants are pronounced substitutes. The
effect is particularly strong: unrestricted resource transfers (of sizes chosen by
government planners in practice) crowd-out the effect of large incentives. Importantly,
we find this pattern of results not only with student nutritional outcomes, but also with
intermediate measures of resource allocation and effort (for example, the provision of
better nutrition and effort to persuade parents to improve their children’s diets at home).
Substitution therefore reflects reductions in administrator effort with larger budgets (and
not simply decreasing marginal returns to inputs in the biological production of child
nutrition).3
Our findings contribute to existing literature on performance incentives in several
ways. First, previous studies on the role of performance pay in the public sector have
generally focused on front-line workers rather than public sector managers (or
“bureaucrats” – an exception is Rasul and Rogger 2013).4 However, the scope of
behavioral responses among managers is potentially much broader, possibly with greater
potential for improving public sector service delivery. Specifically, rather than simply

3

In this paper, we study health (specifically, anemia). In a companion paper (which is in progress), we
examine the issue of multitasking – in particular, whether or not incentives to reduce anemia led schools to
focus on anemia reduction at the expense of teaching. We find no evidence that these incentives led to a
reduction in student test scores on standardized Math and Chinese exams designed by the research team
based on the national curriculum and designed to have good psychometric properties. However, we do find
some evidence of multitasking on margins of teaching where the costs to administrators and teachers of
diverting effort are lower (i.e. tasks that would likely be the first source of diverted effort). For example, in
“secondary subjects” (subjects other than math or Chinese, which are not a focus of high school entrance
exams and hence given less weight in the curriculum) we find evidence of diverted effort when children
were taught these subjects by a homeroom teacher (who was often given responsibilities related to the
anemia program).
4
Several recent studies have examined performance pay provided as personal income to front line workers
in the health and education sectors, including Lavy (2002), Lavy (2009), Glewwe et al. (2010),
Muralidharan & Sundararaman (2011), Duflo et al. (2012), Ashraf et al. (2014) and Behrman et al. (2015).
Other recent studies have focused on incentives to institutions paid as budget revenue. These include
Bloom et al. (2006), Basinga et al. (2011), Gertler and Vermeersch (2012), Olken, Onishi, and Wong
(2014), and Yip et al. (2014). Behrman et al. (2015) also study incentives for school administrators, but
bundled with incentives to students and teachers.

increasing effort, the actions of managers can have greater influence on productive and
allocative efficiency because of the resources under over which they have decisionmaking authority (Holmstrom and Ricart i Costa 1986; Athey and Roberts 2001;
Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul 2007; Burgess et al. 2010).
Second, existing studies of performance pay for managers generally examine the
private sector, but insights from this literature cannot easily be easily extrapolated to
bureaucracies.5 Career concerns can be particularly strong in bureaucracies – and they
may overpower or interact with incentives created by performance pay (Gibbons and
Murphy 1992). Moreover, civil servants may be considerably more pro-socially or
intrinsically motivated (Francois 2000; Francois and Vlassopoulos 2008; Tonin and
Vlassopoulos 2015) – and performance pay may dampen the effects of these motivations
(see Fehr and Falk 2002; Gneezy, Meier, and Rey-Biel 2011; and Kamenica 2012 for
reviews). Finally, public sector production processes tend to be both more complex (due
to multiple objectives and multiple agents, for example – Dixit (2002)) and more
heterogeneous (due to a primary goal being to expand access, which necessitates
operation in a wider range of contexts than private sector organizations that have more
scope to select the markets in which they operate). Performance pay may therefore be
ineffective if rewards are not well-aligned with effective inputs across the range of
contexts within which an organization operates.

5

On performance pay for corporate executives and private sector managers in developed countries, see
Jensen and Murphy (1990), Hall and Liebman (1998), Murphy (1999), Hall and Murphy (2003), and Oyer
and Shaefer (2005). Bandiera et al. (2007) and Bloom et al. (2011) study these virtues of performance pay
for private sector managers in developing countries. Burgess et al. (2010) study a team-based incentive
scheme in the context of a government agency in the UK; although the scheme was not explicitly targeted to
managers, the authors find that the team-based incentive induced managers to reallocate more efficient
workers to incentivized tasks.
4

Third, we contribute to existing literature by studying three mechanism design
considerations of performance pay. One is that we reward outputs directly. In contrast to
rewarding inputs, performance incentives for outputs strengthens incentives for managers
to draw on local information and contextual knowledge to improve both allocative and
productive efficiency – or to “innovate.” Our study is one of the first focused on health to
reward health outputs – and we do indeed find evidence of managerial innovation (school
administrators successfully work with parents to improve diets at home). 6 Another is that
we directly study differential behavioral responses to performance incentives of varying
sizes. Existing literature on this issue is split: a number of studies outside of
organizational settings report large responses to very modest rewards (as well as highly
elastic demand at prices close to zero),7 while others suggest small responses – or even
reductions in effort (when intrinsic motivation is crowded-out, for example).8 Our results
are more closely aligned with the latter.9 Finally, we provide first evidence on how
incentives interact with the amount of resources under contracted agents’ control. A
common focus is on the relative effects of incentive and resource-based approaches (see
Lavy 2002, Hanushek 2006); however, these two approaches are often implemented
simultaneously and are likely to interact in important ways. Theoretically, incentives and
resources available to managers can be complements or substitutes. We study this issue

6

The two exceptions of which we are aware are Singh (2011) and (Miller et al. 2012). Though not studying
the health impacts of incentives tied to health outcomes, Leonard (2003) studies traditional healers’ use of
outcome-contingent contracts in Cameroun. In the education sector, performance pay rewarding good test
scores is more common (Lavy 2009; Muralidharan and Sundararaman 2011; Behrman et al. 2015).

See Gneezy, Meier, and Rey-Biel 2011 for several examples.

We also note at least two key differences with this previous literature: one is that receiving incentive
payments in our study required sustained behavior change (reducing iron deficiency anemia requires
several months of dietary chance), and another is that because all school administrators receive information
about anemia, the presence of incentives may not alter its salience as much (Benhassine et al. 2015).
5

both theoretically and empirically, find evidence of strong substitution when incentives
and budgets are large.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a conceptual
framework for understanding school administrators’ behavioral responses to output-based
performance incentives. Section 3 provides background on school-based nutrition
programs as well as the causes and consequences of anemia. Section 4 describes our
experimental design, data collection, and methods. Section 5 reports our results, and
Section 6 concludes.

2. Conceptual Framework
In this section, we propose a simple model of the school administrator decision
problem that we study. Specifically, we consider the influence of both output-based
performance incentives and discretionary resources on organizational effort – as well as
how they interact (i.e., if they are substitutes or complements). We model the school
administrator (bureaucrat) as choosing effort e to reduce anemia in the school.10
Additionally, the school administrator also decides on the allocation of resources – in
particular, how to divide the school budget G between anemia reduction A and other
school functions G-A. The health production function !(#, %) combines the school
administrator’s effort e and the funds allocated to reducing anemia A in determining
student health H. The school administrator’s maximization problem is therefore:
max - + /0 − 2 (#) + 3(4 − %)
*,+

Total take-home pay w includes both base pay m and a reward or bonus for
improving student health, tH, which is the product of t, the marginal bonus, and H, the
net gain in student health (in our case, the net reduction in the number of students with
anemia). Disutility of effort, v(e), is also strictly increasing but convex: 2 9 > 0, 2 99 ≥ 0.
The parameter /, which is non-negative, allows the school administrator to be altruistic,
deriving direct utility from student health (pro-sociality and public service motivation are
often considered important among public sector workers – for example, see Besley and
Ghatak (2007) and Dal Bó, Finan, and Rossi (2013)). The school administrator also
derives utility from school functions unrelated to health, S(G-A), which is also assumed
to be increasing (3 9 > 0) and concave (3 99 ≤ 0). We make standard assumptions that the
health production function, ! (#, %), is increasing in both arguments and concave (!* >
0, !** < 0, !+ > 0, !++ < 0, !** !++ − !*+ ≥ 0) and the intuitive assumption that !*+ ≥ 0,
or that the marginal productivity of one input is non-decreasing in the level of the other
input.
Assuming an interior solution, the solution to (1)-(4) is equivalent to the solution
to:
max (/ + 6)! (#, %) − 2(#) + 3(4 − %).

The first order conditions are:
>* ≡ (/ + 6)!* (#, %) − 2 9 (#) = 0,

(6)

>+ ≡ (/ + 6)!+ (#, %) − 3′(4 − %) = 0.

(7)

The first order condition (6) implies that the optimal level of effort equates the marginal
benefit of increasing effort (the increase in health, !* (#, %), multiplied by 6 + /,
reflecting both the increase in take-home pay and the altruistic increase in direct utility)
with its marginal cost. Equivalently, the first order condition (7) implies that resources G
are invested in activities unrelated to nutrition up to the point that its marginal benefit,
3′(4 − %), equals the marginal benefit of investing in nutrition-related activities,
(/ + 6)!+ (#, %).
The second order conditions required for a maximum are:

2.1 Comparative Statics
We analyze how the school administrator’s choice of effort and resources
dedicated to nutrition changes both with incentives t and discretionary resources G – both
separately and in combination (as we study empirically through our experiment). First,
we consider each effect separately; the corresponding first order comparative statics (see
the Appendix for these and other derivations and proofs) are:

(14)

Intuitively, an increase in the incentive rate t leads to an increase in both effort and the
amount of resources dedicated to nutrition (11-12). Notably, these increases are greater
when !*+ is larger. Naturally, the larger that !*+ is, the larger is the marginal productivity
of either # or % when the other input increases, accentuating the effect of increasing the
incentive rate.
An increase in discretionary resources also raises both effort and resources
devoted to nutrition (13-14). Note in (13) that if the marginal productivity of effort were
independent of the level of % – that is, if !*+ = 0, then changes in discretionary resources
would not influence effort. This is not a general property, but rather a result of our
simplifying assumption that 2(#) and 3(4 − %) are additive in the utility function, so
# and % only interact through the production function.
An important result is also that 0 < V%/V4 < 1. This means that an increase in 4
translates into a positive but smaller increase in %, implying that the full increase in 4 is
not entirely allocated to %, but rather a share is invested in non-nutritional activities. This
is clear from (7): if 4 and % increased by the same amount, then the term 3′(4 − %)
would not change – and hence could not be equal to (/ + 6)!+ (#, %).
From first order conditions (11-14), it then follows that:

= !* GH + !+ GH > 0,
= !* GU + !+ GU > 0.

To understand the conditions under which incentives and resources are complements or
substitutes, we must compute the cross-partial derivatives of #, %, and 0 with respect to
6 and 4. Note that because the first order comparative statics (11-14) depend on the
second derivatives of v(e), S(G-A), and f(e, A), the cross-partial derivatives will
necessarily depend on the third order derivatives of v(e), S(G-A), and f(e,A). In order to
gain insight, we make the simplifying assumption that the third order derivatives of the
production function are null (i.e., that the production function is quadratic) while leaving
2 999 and 3 999 unrestricted.11
Using the chain rule on 0 = !(#, %), the cross-partial derivative of 0 with respect
to t and G is:
GS
GHGU

G* G*

G+ G+

G* G+

G* G+

G*

(17)

which could be positive (implying that t and G are complements) or negative (implying
that they are substitutes) because the first term in brackets is negative, the second term is
positive (and its size crucially depends on !*+ ), and the third and fourth could be positive
or negative (as shown in the Appendix, which provides expressions for V#/
V6V4 and V%/V6V4). Because the sign of V0/V6V4 cannot be determined a priori, we
discuss in what follows how its sign depends on the sign and size of key derivatives:
3 999 , 2 999 , !*+ .
A key determinant of V0/V6V4 is !*+ , how much the productivity of effort
increases when % increases. A larger !*+ favors complementarity between t and G
11

Note that the third order derivatives of the production function include feee, fAAA, feeA, and feAA; the solution
would be very cumbersome if we did not assume that these are zero.
10

(V0/V6V4 > 0). Intuitively, larger values of 4 imply larger values of %, leading to effort
being more productive (!*+ > 0), and hence a larger response to the incentive.12
Mathematically, !*+ multiplies the second term in (17), which is positive, and also enters
into the formulae for V#/V6V4 and V%/V6V4.
The third derivative of 2(#), 2 999 , defines whether the marginal cost of effort, 2 9 ,
is convex (2 999 > 0) or concave (2 999 < 0). A convex (concave) marginal cost of effort
favor substitution (complementarity). To understand the intuition, assume that the
marginal cost of effort is concave, that is, 2 999 < 0 (i.e. 2 (#) = # ] , 2 < _ < 3), and
consider the following approximation:
G*
GHGU

bKcdedf ,gh bKcdedi ,gh

≈

bg

I

U f IU i

, 4j > 4k .

(18)

Note that V#/V4 > 0, so effort is greater for 4 j than for 4 k . Moreover, the concavity of
the marginal cost of effort implies that, at higher levels of effort, the marginal cost of effort
increases at a lower rate. Hence, the marginal cost of effort increases at a lower rate at 4 j
than at 4 k . Hence, the response of effort to an increase in incentives, V#(4, 6)/V6, i.e. the
terms in the numerator of (18), might be larger for 4 j than 4 k because the increase in the
marginal cost of effort will be smaller.
A similar argument can be made to explain why 3 999 > 0 is conducive to
complementarity. Ultimately, both # and % are inputs in the health production function,

Note that if 3 999 < 0, the term 3 999 !*+ , which is part of V#/V6V4 (see the Appendix), can partially offset
this effect.

12

11

but 2(#) is increasing in # while 3(4 − %) is decreasing in %. This explains why if 2 999 <
0 favors complementarity, 3 999 > 0 also does.13
The flexibility of the model means that our predictions depend on three key
parameters. Having discussed the effect of each of them individually, Table 1 below
summarises the necessary and sufficient conditions that the model provides.

3. Background
3.1 School-Based Nutrition Programs
School-based interventions are believed to be among the most cost-effective
approaches for delivering health and nutrition services to children in developing countries
(Bundy and Guyatt 1996; Jukes, Drake, and Bundy 2008; Orazem, Glewwe, and Patrinos
2008). Because schools are natural points of contact with school-aged children, they may
provide a platform from which health and nutrition interventions can be delivered at
relatively low cost (Bundy and Guyatt 1996; Bundy et al. 2006; Jukes, Drake, and Bundy
2008). Because of this, school-based health, nutrition and feeding programs are a
ubiquitously central function of schools, particularly in developing countries.

Note that if one assumed a simple power function such as 3(4 − %) = (4 − %)l , the condition that 3 99 <
0, would also imply necessarily that 3 999 > 0. However, this would not be the case for other functional
forms, such as a cubic polynomial.
13

12

In China, schools have the legal responsibility to promote the health of their
students (Education Law of the Peoples Republic of China, 1995). Although school
administrators are evaluated as part of the cadre evaluation system (ganbu kaohe zhidu) –
a system for evaluating public officials and servants in China (Whiting 2004) – measures
of child health are not typically included as criteria for evaluation.
3.2 The Causes and Consequences of Anemia
Our study examines school-based programs to reduce anemia. Anemia is
estimated to affect nearly one quarter of all school-aged children worldwide (World
Health Organization 2001). Although there are many causes of anemia (including a
variety of genetic disorders and infections as well as nutritional deficiencies), iron
deficiency accounts for about 50% of cases globally (Balarajan et al. 2011; Pasricha et al.
2013)14 – and 85-95% of cases in China (Du et al. 2000).
The consequences of iron deficiency—with or without anemia—can be
substantial, particularly for children at critical stages of development. A large literature
links iron deficiency to fatigue and reduced work capacity among adolescents and adults,
impaired cognition and cognitive development among children, and reduced immune
response for all age groups (Thomas et al. 2006; R. Yip 2001; World Health Organization
2001; Balarajan et al. 2011). School-aged children with anemia (the focus of our study)
have also been shown to have inferior educational outcomes (grades, attendance, and
school attainment – Taras 2005; Nokes, van den Bosch, and Bundy 1998).
3.3 Biomedical Strategies for Reducing Anemia

There is some debate in the public health literature on the proportion of the anemia burden attributable to
iron deficiency (Balarajan et al. 2011). Intestinal worms are unlikely to be a major cause of anemia in our
study areas as the prevalence of hookworm (the parasite most commonly associated with anemia) is low (Xu
et al. 1995).
13

Increasing iron consumption can effectively prevent iron deficiency anemia.
Worldwide, fortifying staple foods with iron has historically been an effective approach
to addressing micronutrient deficiencies (Allen et al. 2006). Fortification is an attractive
strategy because it requires little behavior change and because it can be implemented on a
large scale. However, fortification of staple foods may be ineffective in areas like
Northwest China in which households grow and consume their own food (Allen et al.
2006).
An alternative approach is to increase the consumption of naturally iron-rich
foods and those that promote iron absorption during digestion. Animal sources (including
red meats, fish, and poultry) provide heme iron, which is more easily absorbed during
digestion; plant sources (including green, leafy vegetables) provide non-heme iron, which
is less readily absorbed – but can be promoted by consumption of vitamin C (and
inhibited by consumption of milk and other calcium-rich products).
Finally, a third approach is the delivery of micronutrient supplements (for
example, vitamins) containing iron. To be effective, however, regular consumption over
several few months is necessary – and so inadequate compliance may render
supplementation ineffective (Bobonis et al. 2006; Bhutta et al. 2013; Pasricha et al. 2013;
Martorell et al. 2015).15

15
Previous trials addressing iron deficiency and anemia have suffered from low levels of compliance or
attempted to preempt compliance problems. Bobonis et al. (2006), for example, instructed preschool teachers
to provide children with iron therapy for 30 days following health camps but found that only around 18 days
were actually administered. The WISE study in Indonesia (Thomas et al. 2006) hired facilitators to regularly
visit participants and remind them to take their supplements.

4. The Experiment
4.1 Sampling
To draw our study sample, we began with all 36 counties officially designated by
the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western
China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province,
and Ankang in Shaanxi Province – see Figure 1). In August 2011, we conducted a
canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the
number of students enrolled in each. Restricting our sampling frame to primary schools
with 150-300 students total,16 we randomly selected 170 of 1,410 eligible schools for
inclusion in our study (and limited our selection to one school per township17). Our
sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools
in the same region of China (Miller et al. 2012).18
Within study schools, we randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students
from each school. In China, fourth and fifth grade students are typically 10 to 11 years
old, and we chose these grades to select students whom we considered sufficiently old to
provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent (given the independent effect of menarche on hemoglobin concentration). We

16
A lower bound of 150 students was chosen to ensure that the number of samples students per school was
enough to meet power requirements. 300 was chosen as the upper bound to keep the project within budget.
These bounds are on reported school sizes; actual numbers of students are often significantly less than
reported. Note that 39.9% of rural primary schools in the sampling frame (all rural primary schools in
project counties) were reported to be within this range.
17
Local administration of schools is generally done at the school district level, which is below the
township. Contamination due to two school administrators meeting at events organized at higher levels, for
example, was thus unlikely.
18
Using data from Miller et al. (2012), we performed Montecarlo simulations to conduct power
calculations for students who were anemic at the time of that study’s baseline survey. The intra-class
correlation was estimated adjusting for covariates (baseline hemoglobin concentration, the number of
students in each school, whether schools had a kitchen, student-teacher ratio, distance to the furthest village
served by the school, percent boarding students, and county dummies), which we also specified as
covariates in the current study’s pre-analysis plan.

15

also conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at
baseline to obfuscate our focus on fourth and fifth graders.
4.2 Data Collection
We conducted our baseline survey in September 2011 and our follow-up survey in
May 2012 (at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed
information on students, households, school administrators, and schools.
Student Surveys. We interviewed all sampled students at their school, collecting
information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities,
and general health. To collect information on school and home feeding practices, students
were also given standard food frequency questionnaires to record information about food
consumption at school and at home over the past week.19
We also measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the
student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University
accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site
(at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems.
Household Surveys. For each sampled student, we also collected information on
students’ households using forms completed by parents.20 Specifically, these surveys
collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household

19

Information on food consumption was collected using a seven-day recall “food frequency questionnaires”
(FFQs) completed by students as part of the endline survey. These questionnaires asked children the number
of times they had eaten each of 33 food items in the past seven days, separately for school and home. Food
frequency questionnaires (FFQs) have long been used in nutrition research and have been recommended for
use in large surveys of children given low cost and low respondent burden (McPherson et al. 2000; Magarey
et al. 2011). FFQ responses by children about their own consumption has been shown to be more accurate
than the responses of their parents (Burrows et al. 2013).
20
For budgetary reasons, household surveys were given to students to take home and return. As a result,
household forms are missing for approximately 20% of students. All possible information on students and
households was collected with the student survey, which was administered by enumerators.
16

income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on
other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be
unlikely to know themselves.
School Administrator Surveys. We interviewed school administrators
(bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were
told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again
at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their
background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional
responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Using scales adapted from Grant (2008), we also
measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their
participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline
survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding
of the training material.
School Surveys. Finally, we collected basic information from schools (about
enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (about teacher
characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).
4.3 Experimental Design
We designed our study as a cluster-randomized trial using a 3×2 crosscutting
design (Figure 2). After conducting our baseline survey, we provided all school
administrators with information about anemia (see our written materials in the online
appendix – and which also included a video presentation by a Chinese nutrition
specialist), and schools were randomly assigned one of six experimental cells (see Figure
3 for the study timeline). The first three paths of Figure 2 show randomly-assigned

17

incentive groups: a group without incentives (Group A), a “small” incentive group
(Group B), and a “large” incentive group (Group C). Across these arm are two
orthogonally-assigned block grant groups: a “small” block grant group (Group 1) and a
“large” block grant group (Group 2). The reference group in our six-cell design is the
default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no
incentives, Group A1).21
To improve power, we used a stratified randomization procedure. Specifically,
using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration
and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, we
randomized cell assignment within each stratum. Stratification improves power by
ensuring balance on these covariates between experimental groups. Our analysis takes
this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects (Bruhn
and McKenzie 2009).
Incentives for Anemia Reduction. In the large incentive arm (65 schools, Group C
in Figure 2), we offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private
income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between
the beginning and end of the school year. The specific structure of the large incentive
contract was:
125 pqr ∗ (tu − t* )
m=n
0

v! (tu − t* ) > 0
w6ℎ#y-vz#

21

Thus, all schools in the experiment received a small or large grant. This was done to ensure that all schools
had access to resources that could be devoted to anemia reduction. In a previous study, we find that educating
school administrators on anemia (including the same information as in the current study) alone, without
incentives or grants, had no detectable impact on anemia rates (Miller et al. 2012). Our reference group also
mimics how a recent Chinese school nutrition program (costing 16 billion yuan per year) was designed.
Under the program, local education bureaus and schools receive 3 yuan per day per student (4 yuan for
boarding students) to provide nutritious meals. How exactly the program is implemented and monitored
varies widely across localities.
18

where tu is the number of students found to be anemic at baseline and t* is the number
of who were anemic at the time of the endline survey.22 Based on an earlier study (Miller
et al. 2012), the contract increment (125 yuan (RMB), or about $19.4023) per student
reduction was chosen to provide roughly two months of a school administrator’s annual
salary for a feasible reduction in anemia given previous studies (a reduction of about
50%).24 Actual payouts for school administrators with the large incentive and small
block were ultimately 3,303 yuan (or about $516) – approximately two month’s base pay
for school administrators in this region. We did not reveal the identity of students who
were anemic at baseline to administrators (and when we asked teachers to identify
students who were anemic at endline, they were unable to do so).25
The small incentive arm (40 schools, Group B in Figure 2) was identical to the
large incentive arm except that the magnitude of the incremental incentive was ten times
smaller (12.5 RMB, or about $1.95 per student reduction in anemia between baseline and
follow-up in our sample). This magnitude of this incentive provides roughly 0.2
additional months of annual salary for the same feasible reduction in anemia given
previous studies.

22

We measured anemia using a sample of 50 4th and 5th graders and calculated the implied number of
anemic children in the school using the prevalence rate in our sample. Although administrators could
possibly discern which students were tested at baseline (although testing was done before contract
assignment), they were later told explicitly that another sample of students would be drawn at the end of the
school year. Moreover, unreported analyses show that teachers were unable to correctly name or identify
anemic students at endline.
23
We use a conversion rate of $1 = 6.4 RMB, the approximate exchange rate at the time of the baseline
survey (September 2011).
24
There are presumably superior contract structures, but optimal contract design requires substantial
information not available to us, including information about the cost of provider effort, the productivity of
provider effort, and the utility functions of both providers and the contracting ‘principal’ (Laffont and Tirole
1993; Salanié 2005). Simple, easily understandable contracts may also appear more transparent to school
administrators and promote credibility.
25
We did reveal the identity of students who were severely anemic (with hemoglobin concentration below
80 g/L) as these students required immediate medical attention. There were 3 such students found at
baseline.
19

At the time that school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told
the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (the identity of anemic children
was not revealed).26 Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director
of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the
contract, one of which they kept). Note that all interventions were implemented in
partnership with local education bureaus, signifying to school administrators that the
project was sanctioned by local governments.
Block Grants. The small block grant (Group 1 in Figure 2) was 0.3 RMB ($0.05)
per student per day (85 schools), which we calculated to be adequate for school
administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant
(Group 2 in Figure 2) was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day (85 schools). In total,
small block grant schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and large block grant
schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two
installments, once at the beginning of the program and another approximately half way
through the school year.27 Although funds were given in the context of the nutrition
program roll-out, administrators were explicitly told that they were free to allocate these
at their discretion to other school functions benefitting students – whether this be for

26

Note that administrators in all study cells were provided the same information about the number of
anemic children in their respective schools.
27
After explaining block grant assignment to administrators, we asked them to complete a non-binding
budget plan for how they intended to use the block grant. Our study team emphasized that this plan was nonbinding, but this plan would be used to coordinate orders for iron supplements to be delivered to schools.
This was necessary because the market for supplements in rural areas is limited. Administrators were free to
change their supplement orders at any time. Administrators had no reason to believe that second installments
were conditional on performance – they were given an explicit time frame and told an explicit amount for
the second installment.
20

educational goods, health specific goods, or general school supplies.28 Indeed, Figure 4
shows that administrators used a substantial share of their grants for activities unrelated
to nutrition.
Health Education. Because knowledge about anemia in our study areas was poor,
prior to revealing treatment assignment, we provided health education about nutrition and
anemia to all school administrators in our study (see online appendix for materials). Our
health education materials were based on published, peer-reviewed studies and
specifically included information about: 1) the prevalence and causes of anemia, 2) the
consequences of anemia (including its effect on cognitive development and academic
performance), and 3) efficacious nutritional approaches to reduce anemia (increasing
dietary intake of iron-rich foods, nutritional supplementation with iron fortified soy and
flour or with supplements, etc.).
4.4 Balance and Attrition
Summary statistics and tests for balance across study arms are shown in Table 2.29
Panel A shows student level characteristics (N=2051), Panel B shows characteristics of
schools (N=167), and Panel C shows characteristics of school administrators (N=167).30
The first two columns of the table give the mean and standard deviation of each variable
in the comparison (small block grant, no incentive) group. Columns (3) – (7) show

28

Note that while these transfers were not large compared to total school expenditures, they do represent a
significant increase in budgetary autonomy for school administrators as the bulk of school expenditures are
earmarked for specified uses at higher levels of administration. While administrators often have discretion
over small expenditures, larger expenses require approval from upper levels.
29
This table shows summary statistics and tests balance for our main analysis sample of students initially
anemic at baseline. Summary statistics and balance tests for the full sample are given in Appendix Table 1.
30
Although 170 schools were included in the study, no students were found to be anemic in 3 schools at
baseline. No schools refused participation in the study. The baseline anemia rate (defined as Hb<120 g/L)
in the full sample was 24%. Appendix Table 11 shows transitions in and out of anemia status in the
comparison (Small Grant Only) group.
21

coefficients on treatment variables and interactions estimated using Equation (19),
controlling only for randomization strata fixed effects. The final column shows the pvalue from a test that the coefficients are jointly zero for each characteristic. Only 4 of
the 75 tests are significant at the 10% level, and a test for joint equality is rejected at the
10% level for only one characteristic (the number of times meat was consumed in the
past week). Joint tests for all 15 characteristics reveal no significant differences.31
The overall attrition rate between baseline and endline surveys was 6.2% in our
sample of children anemic at baseline (5% for the full sample). Defining attrition as a
missing hemoglobin measurement at endline for students with a baseline measurement,
Appendix Table 2 shows that there were no meaningful differences in attrition across
treatment groups (Columns 1 & 2). Analyzing the correlates of a missing household
survey at endline conditional on a child not dropping out, Appendix Table 2 also shows
that neither the treatment indicators nor other covariates are significantly correlated with
a missing household survey form.
4.5 Empirical Strategy
Given random assignment of schools to treatment cells shown in Figure 2,
comparisons of outcome variable means across treatment groups provides unbiased
estimates of the effect of each experimental treatment. However, to increase power (and
to account for our stratified randomization procedure), we condition our estimates on a
set of covariates used in power calculations. With few exceptions, all of the analyses
presented (including outcome variables, regression specifications, and hypotheses tested)
were pre-specified in a pre-analysis plan written and filed before endline data were

31

These tests were conducted by regressing treatment status on all 15 baseline covariates and testing that
the coefficients were jointly zero. The smallest p-value from these F-tests was 0.29.
22

available for analysis.32 In reporting results below, we explicitly note analyses that
deviate from the pre-analysis plan.
As specified in advance, we use ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression to
estimate the effect of cell assignment on child-level outcomes with the following
specification:
9
{|,} = _ + ~ 3Ä} + ~C ÅÄ} + ~Ç Å4} + ~É Ñ3Ä} Ö × ÑÅ4} Ö + ~á ÑÅÄ} Ö × ÑÅ4} Ö + à|,}
â + ä|,}

(19)

where {|,} is the outcome for child i in school j; 3Ä} is a dummy that equals 1 if the
administrator in school j was assigned to receive a small incentive contract and 0
otherwise; ÅÄ} is equal to 1 if the administrator in school j was assigned to receive a large
anemia reduction incentive contract; Å4} is equal to 1 if the school received a large block
grant; à|,} is a vector of child controls (age, class-year, and gender, and baseline value of
the outcome variable), school controls (number of students, student-teacher ratio, whether
the school has a kitchen, proportion of boarding students, and distance to the farthest
village in the school’s catchment area); and dummy variables for counties and
randomization strata. We adjusted our standard errors for clustering at the school level
using Liang-Zeger clustered standard errors.
In addition to estimating effects on our two primary outcomes (hemoglobin
concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), we use the same
specification to estimate effects on secondary outcomes to examine the behavioral
mechanisms underlying changes in primary outcomes. For these secondary outcomes,
we focus our analysis on summary indices constructed using groups of closely-related

32

This analysis plan was filed with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at
http://www.povertyactionlab.org/Hypothesis-Registry.
23

outcome variables (as we specified in advance). To construct these indices, we used the
GLS weighting procedure described by Anderson (2008). For each individual, we
constructed a variable z̅|} as the weighted average of å normalized outcome variables in
group (ç|}é ). The weight placed on each outcome variable is the sum of its row entries in
the inverted covariance matrix for group è such that:
I
z̅|} = cê′ëìí êh

where ê is a column vector of 1s, ëìí

I

I

I
cê′ëìí î|} h

is the inverted covariance matrix, and î|} is a

column vector of all outcomes for individual v in group è. In addition to reducing the
number of tests required, this weighting procedure can improve efficiency by placing less
weight on outcomes that are highly correlated and more weight on those less correlated.
The summary index variable can also be created for individuals with a subset of missing
outcomes (these outcomes simply receive less weight in the construction of the index).
Although we emphasize these indices in our discussion, we also report estimates for each
individual index component in Appendix Tables 5 to 8.
A note on correcting for multiple comparisons is also warranted. For our primary
estimates, we test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their
interactions (shown in Equation 19)) and three additional ones – that the small and large
incentives have the same average effect (~ = ~C ), that the large incentive and the large
block grant have the same average effect (~C = ~Ç ), and that the average effect of the
large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero (~C + ~á = 0).33 We therefore adjust

33

We did not pre-specify the last of these (whether or not the joint effect of the large grant and large
incentive is negative), but we did pre-specify whether or not incentives and large grants are complements or
substitutes (~É = 0, ~á = 0).
24

our p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER), or the probability of at least
one Type I error. Specifically, we use the free step-down resampling method of Westfall
and Young (1993). This procedure accounts for the dependency of the data, and is
therefore more powerful than procedures that do not (a Bonferroni correction, for
example). For secondary outcomes, we adjust our p-values according to the total number
of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five –
the number of treatment coefficients in each regression).

5. Results: Childhood Anemia and Underlying Behavioral Responses
In this section, we first present results obtained by estimating Equation (19) for
anemia status and hemoglobin concentration, and in Section 5.2, we then investigate the
underlying behavioral responses that may have produced them. Following our preanalysis plan, we emphasize estimates from our sub-sample of children who were anemic
at baseline. In the Appendix Tables we report results for the full sample of children
receiving hemoglobin tests (Appendix Tables 3, 4, 6, and 8).
5.1. Childhood Anemia
The first five rows of Table 3 report estimates for each treatment and their
interactions (and the seventh row reports comparison group means for the no incentive,
small grant group at endline). For each estimate, we report the regression coefficient, the
standard error and corresponding p-value, and the p-value adjusted for multiple
hypotheses testing.34

34

Table 3 reports results for students found to be anemic at baseline as pre-specified. Appendix Table 3
shows main results for the full sample.
25

Result 1: Large Incentives. First, we find that the large incentive significantly
reduced the probability of anemia at endline in schools receiving a small grant.
Specifically, the large incentive was associated with a 14 percentage point reduction in
anemia (Table 3, Row 2, Column 1; unadjusted p-value=0.001, adjusted p-value=0.064),
implying a 37.9% reduction relative to the comparison group (small grant, no incentive
schools) at endline. The corresponding increase in hemoglobin was about 2.6 g/L (Table
3, Row 2, Column 2; unadjusted p-value=0.015, adjusted P-value=0.285). These
empirical findings agree with our model’s prediction derived in Equations (11-12).
Because our incentives rewarded anemia reduction (and not hemoglobin levels
per se) and anemia status reflects shifts in the distribution of altitude adjusted hemoglobin
concentrations across the 120g/L threshold, Figure 5A plots the distribution of endline
hemoglobin concentrations (adjusted for covariates included in Equation 19) by study
arm among children who were anemic at baseline. The distribution for the large incentive
group is shifted to the right of the control group distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirov test pvalue=0.02). This relative shift in mass is greater in the left tail of the distribution,
implying that the large incentive reduced the share of children falling below the anemia
threshold.
Result 2: Small Incentives. Second, in contrast, the small incentive had no
detectable effect on the probability of anemia at endline (Table 3, Row 1, Column 1).
Comparing the estimates for small and large incentives (~ = ~C in Equation (19)), we
also reject the null hypothesis that the two estimates are equal (Table 3, Row 8, Column
1; adjusted p-value=0.089). Taken together, the estimates for the small and large
incentives suggest that the price effect of incentives is meaningful independent of

26

information conveyed by the presence of an incentive contract (Gneezy and Rustichini
2000). Figure 5A shows that the shift in the hemoglobin distribution for the small
incentive arm relative to the control group arm is smaller – particularly in the left tail of
the distribution.
An important question in the literature on financial incentives is whether or not
they crowd-out intrinsic or pro-social motivation (Deci and Ryan 1985; Gneezy and
Rustichini 2000; Fehr and Falk 2002; Francois and Vlassopoulos 2008; Gneezy, Meier,
and Rey-Biel 2011; Kamenica 2012). We find that the effects of the small incentive on
anemia was significantly more positive amongst school administrators who score higher
at baseline on a pro-sociality scale (adapted from Grant (2008)) (Appendix Table 10,
Row 1, Columns 1–3; adjusted p-value = 0.038). We also find a similar effect for
intrinsic motivation (also adapted from Grant (2008)), but the difference in effects is not
statistically significant (Appendix Table 10, Row 4, Columns 1–3; adjusted p-value =
0.570). However, the effect of the large incentive is not heterogeneous by pro-social or
intrinsic motivation (the coefficients are close to zero and not statistically significant),
implying that if monetary incentives are large, crowding-out of pro-social motivation
may be overcome by extrinsic motivation provided by incentives.
Result 3: Large Block Grants. Third, in the absence of any explicit incentive, the
large block grant alone reduced the probability of student anemia at endline (an
unambiguous prediction of our model, as Equations 13, 14 and 16 show). Specifically,
Table 3 (Column 1, Row 3) shows that the large block grant was associated with a 14.5
percentage point reduction in anemia (adjusted p-value=0.047), implying a 39.8%
reduction relative to the comparison group at endline. This reduction is very similar to the

27

effect of the large incentive (-0.145 vs. -0.138), but the average increase in hemoglobin
concentration is larger (4.205 vs. 2.567), although not statistically so (Table 3, Row 9,
Column 2; adjusted p-value=0.597).
Result 4: Interactions between Incentives and Grants. Whether or not incentives
and unrestricted grants are complements or substitutes is an empirical issue. The model in
Section 2 makes clear that both complements or substitutes are possible depending on
cross partial derivatives of the hemoglobin production function as well as the curvature of
the marginal cost of effort and the marginal utility that the school administrator obtains
from non-nutritional activities. We do not find evidence of complementarity – and
notably, incentives and block grants can be strong substitutes if the incentives are
sufficiently large.
Table 3 shows that the interaction between the large incentive and the large block
grant (~á in Equation 19; Table 3, Column 1, Row 5) is positive and statistically
significant (adjusted p-value=0.072). Moreover, the magnitude of substitution implies
that the large incentive and the large block grant fully crowd each other out: the marginal
effect of the large incentive given the large block grant in Column 1 (~C + ~á = 0.058) is
not statistically different from zero (adjusted p-value = 0.65) for the probability of
anemia.35 Although this point estimate is positive, we are not able to rule out a negative
effect of the large incentive given a large block grant on anemia as predicted by Equation
(15) of the model in Section 2. Adding coefficients, the estimated total effect of the Large
Incentive and Large Grant on anemia is -0.087 (adjusted p-value: 0.177).

Likewise, ~Ç + ~á , the marginal effect of increasing the grant amount given large incentives is
insignificant (~Ç + ~á = 0.051, adjusted p-value 0.742).

35

28

Given decreasing marginal returns to inputs in the reduction of anemia, a natural
question arising from these results is if substitution between incentives and resources is
due to (i) the biological relationship between inputs and anemia (i.e., although more
inputs are used, there is no effect on anemia because of biological constraints) or (ii)
conscious decisions by administrators. Our results for input use in Section 5.2 are
consistent with the latter interpretation (we find direct evidence of substitution in input
use). (We also note that efficacy trials of iron supplementation suggest that much larger
reductions in anemia are biologically possible (Gera et al. 2007)). Given that we find
similar results for input use in the full sample (Appendix Table 4), differences in the
effects of incentives and resources on anemia rates between the sample of children
anemic at baseline (Table 3) and the full sample (Appendix Table 3) are likely explained
by decreasing marginal returns to inputs in the reduction of anemia rather than
diminishing marginal returns to effort on the part of administrators.

5.2. Behavioral Responses Underlying Changes in Anemia
We next examine the underlying behavioral responses to our interventions that
may have produced the changes in anemia described in Section 5.1. To do so, we focus
on actions taken by administrators and subsequent responses among students and their
parents – specifically, student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron
supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its
nutritional basis. For each family of outcome variables, we examine indices as described
in Section 4.5.

29

Behavioral Responses Underlying Result 1: Large Incentives. We first consider
the behavioral responses underlying Result 1 – that in the presence of the small block
grant, the large incentive significantly reduced the probability of student anemia. The
results in Table 4 suggest that the large incentive led administrators to increase vitamin
supplementation and the provision of iron-rich foods (Column 1, Row 2; adjusted p-value
0.105). This increase in iron-rich foods seems driven largely by home consumption (Row
2, Column 5, adjusted p-value 0.090).36
An interesting issue is if the increase is vitamin supplementation and provision of
iron-rich foods occurred because school administrators with large incentives spent the
block grant differently – or instead because they exerted more effort. As Figure 4 shows,
reported use of block grants for different types of nutrition interventions (vitamins, food,
fortification), and other uses is similar for incentive and non-incentives schools receiving
a small grant, suggesting that greater anemia reduction due to incentives is driven by
effort rather than differential allocation of the block grant.
In exploring how administrators were able to increase child consumption of iron
rich foods at home, we examine contact with parents. Row 2, Column 8 of Table 4
reports a positive (but insignificant) increase in contact. However, Appendix Table 7
shows that estimates for several components of this index appear meaningful and
important, albeit insignificant at conventional levels using adjusted p-values (largely
because of the large number of hypotheses being tested (11×5=55).37 These results are

36

Sub-indices for supplements and food (including separate indices for food at home and school) were not
explicitly specified in the pre-analysis plan. Appendix Table 9 reproduces Table 4, including additional
tests of linear combinations of coefficients estimated using Equation (19). These additional tests were not
pre-specified.
37
Specifically, the number of individual meetings between administrators and households over the past
semester increased by 0.52 (Column 2, Row 2) – an increase of 59%; whether or not schools contacted
parents about nutrition in the past semester rose by 12 percentage points (Column 3, Row 2) – an increase
30

suggestive that the large incentive led administrators to engage more regularly with
households – specifically about nutrition and anemia – which in turn appears to have
improved children’s diets at home.
The finding that administrators responded to large incentives by engaging with
households is important for at least two related reasons. First, it demonstrates innovation
and the use of local knowledge in response to performance incentives that reward outputs
(health outcomes) as opposed to those that rigidly reward the use of pre-specified inputs
(such as vitamin consumption at school), as most performance incentives in the health
sector do (Miller and Singer Babiarz, 2014). Second, for outcomes jointly produced with
beneficiary households (like good child nutrition), it demonstrates the potential of
performance incentives that reward outputs to minimize offsetting compensatory
behavior among beneficiaries (a common finding among studies of school lunch
programs, for example) (Jacoby 2002; Leonard 2003; Kazianga et al. 2009; Das et al.
2013).38
Behavioral Responses Underlying Result 2: Small Incentives. Second, we study
the behavioral responses underlying Result 2 – that the small incentive did not reduce
anemia prevalence. Table 4 (Column 1) shows that administrators with small incentives
did not significantly increase the provision of supplements or Food (Row 1, Columns 1 to

of 29%; and whether or not schools contacted parents about feeding children iron-rich foods rich in the past
semester rose by 10 percentage points (Column 4, Row 2) – an increase of 47%. Note that the number of
school-wide parent meetings and number of individual meetings with parents were not pre-specified to be
part of this index.
38
We speculate that the bureaucratic environment is one reason that administrators chose to work through
households. Administrators may have viewed this strategy as a way to reduce anemia (and increase
rewards) while avoiding the risk of career harm due to possible adverse events. This career harm may also
be more severe under incentives if incentives altered perceptions of administrators’ motivation for reducing
anemia (analogous to how incentives may crowd-out effort if they alter the motives for prosocial tasks
perceived by others – Bénabou and Tirole (2006)).
31

3), nor did they increase their contact with households (Column 8) (Appendix Table 7,
Row 1 also shows that none of the individual components of this index are statistically
significant (even using unadjusted p-values).
Behavioral Responses Underlying Result 3: Large Block Grants. Third, we
examine behavioral responses to large block grants, which reduced the prevalence of
student anemia. The large block grant significantly increased the provision of
supplements and food (Table 4, Row 3, Column 1; adjusted p-value 0.004). This increase
appears due to increases in both iron supplements (Column 2, adjusted p-value 0.051)
and iron-rich food (Column 3, adjusted p-value 0.092).
Interestingly, the large block grant may have also increased school contact with
parents – suggesting that administrators worked through households to reduce anemia
without any explicit incentives to do so. Although the estimate for the index in Table 4 is
not statistically significant (Row 3, Column 8), some estimates for index components are
larger than those for incentives. This may reflect intrinsic or prosocial motivation – or a
sense of obligation or organizational mission (Ashraf, Bandiera, and Jack, 2014).
Furthermore, although the large block grant increased communication with households,
the impact of block grants on food consumption at home is insignificant. We speculate
that this could reflect less effort (relative to administrators with incentives) devoted to
mitigating compensatory behavior by households in response to greater food provision at
school (which seems to have increased, although not significantly, with large grants).
Behavioral Responses Underlying Result 4: Substitution between Large Incentives
and Large Block Grants. Finally, with the combination of large incentives and large
block grants, we find direct evidence of crowding-out of inputs consistent with our

32

anemia estimates in Table 3. Specifically, Table 4 shows that for vitamin
supplementation and consumption of iron-rich foods (both at school and at home),
estimates for the interaction between the large incentive and large block grant are
negative, implying substitution (Row 5). The interaction between the small incentive and
large grant is also negative, but smaller in magnitude and only marginally significant.
Overall, there is no evidence that resources and incentives are complements – and that at
sufficiently high levels, they are substitutes.39
5.3. Comparative Cost-Effectiveness
Finally, we examine the comparative cost-effectiveness of each of our
intervention combinations. In doing so, we consider both the sub-sample of children
anemic at baseline and our full sample of children, and we present both “programmatic”
cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and
social cost-effectiveness calculations. We calculate total social costs as the sum of: (a)
programmatic costs; (b) the cost of public funds; and (c) costs incurred by households in
responding to the interventions. From social costs we exclude incentive payments (apart
from their contribution the cost of public funds), considering these payments to be
transfers (Kremer, Miguel and Thornton 2009). Incentive payments may also not be
considered a cost, but rather simply another way of allocating salary expenditures
(Muralidharan and Sundararaman 2011). Note that while we only consider comparative
cost-effectiveness in reducing anemia prevalence (the primary outcome of the study), it is
possible that the treatments, particularly the block grant, do produce other benefits not
considered here. Moreover, if the sole purpose of transfers to schools is to reduce anemia,

39

Given our experimental design, we are unable to rule out the possibility of complementarity at lower
levels of resources.
33

there may be more cost-effective options than unrestricted block grants. Our goal is not to
conduct a full cost-benefit analysis, but rather to compare strategies for reducing anemia.
Although we find no intervention effects on standardized exam scores, even these
(together with anemia measures) may fail to fully capture intervention benefits.
Table 5 presents these results.40 The key finding that we highlight is that although
large block grants were as effective in reducing student anemia as large incentives, they
were more expensive. First, considering full social costs and using the full sample, the
relative cost per case of anemia averted was 1,453 yuan (about $227) in the large
incentive/small block grant group – but 44% larger in the large block grant group (2,099
yuan, or about $328).41 Second, the cost-effectiveness of these two interventions relative
to each other is similar when we restrict our calculations to children anemic at baseline
(as we do in Sections 4 and 5, following our pre-analysis plan). Specifically, the large
incentive/small block grant intervention is approximately 50% more cost effective than
large block grant intervention without incentives (723 yuan, or $113, per case of anemia
averted vs. 1,447 yuan, or $226). Finally, considering calculating only programmatic
costs and using children anemic at baseline, the cost-effectiveness of the large
incentive/small block grant intervention is roughly one third of that of the large block
grant (114 yuan, or about $18 vs 331 yuan, or about $52).

40

See table notes for further details about these calculations.
These estimates exclude administrative costs of the incentive scheme (assuming these would be rolled
into existing policies as noted in the notes to Table 5). When the costs incurred for anemia testing (6.7
RMB per child in a sample of 50 children per school annually) are included in costs of the incentive
scheme, the large incentive/small block grant remains more socially cost-effective than the large block
grant at 1,848 yuan per case averted.

6. Conclusion
This paper provides new evidence on how public sector managers respond to the
provision of performance incentives. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to
analyze how behavioral responses to performance pay interact with exogenously assigned
levels of resources – a critical issue in the design of incentive systems under stringent
resource constraints (as is common in many developing countries).
We report four key findings. First, when school administrators have fewer
budgetary resources available to them, large performance incentives (with realized
payments equivalent to a couple of months of annual salary) lead to substantial
improvement in service delivery. This seems driven by greater effort rather than changes
in budgetary resource allocation. In particular, we find evidence that school
administrators were able to innovate, working through their students’ parents to alter
nutritional practices at home. Second, smaller incentives (one tenth the size of the larger
ones) were ineffective on average and had negative effects on pro-socially motivated
administrators. Third, even absent explicit performance incentives, increasing school
administrators’ budgets led to important improvements in performance (but was
considerably less cost-effective than using performance incentives), implying the
presence of other motives – potentially including intrinsic ones – in our context.
Fourth, we find that performance incentives and unrestricted grants are substitutes
in the production of health when incentives are large. The degree of substitution is
substantial: at the policy-relevant levels that we study, increasing the size of unrestricted
block grants completely crowds-out the effect of incentives (and vice-versa). This is an
important result for resource-poor environments in which both budgetary resources and

35

performance incentives are used simultaneously as policy levers for improving the
quality of public service delivery.
There are of course limitations to this study. One is that, as with all empirical
studies, our results are not generalizable to settings beyond our study context. However,
school-based nutrition programs like the one we study are nearly ubiquitous in low- and
middle-income countries (Del Rosso and Marek 1996, Wanjirũ and Flisher 2004, Bundy
et al. 2006, Orazem et al 2008). Because a large share of children attend school in most
countries, school-based programs are widely considered to be among the most costeffective means of delivering child health interventions (Orazem et al 2008). We believe
that our study provides behavioral insights relevant in a variety of settings in which
managers have budgetary discretion – and increasingly also face high powered
incentives. Another is that our study estimates short-run intervention effects. Longer-run
effects may differ, particularly as administrators learn more about the relationships
among their effort, various inputs, and anemia reduction. Finally, although we find that
incentives for school administrators to reduce student anemia were effective, we also note
features that may make our setting conducive to the use of performance incentives. One
is that the rewarded outcome (anemia reduction) can be measured objectively and
reliably. Relative to other settings, frontline workers (teachers in our setting) in China
may also be relatively responsive to instruction from administrators, which might
alleviate problems of moral hazard in teams that could be more prevalent elsewhere.
Overall, among public sector administrators in rural China, we find evidence that
appropriately designed performance incentives (sufficiently large, and absent substantial
discretionary resources) can improve public sector service delivery – and ultimately,

36

child outcomes. Despite the bureaucratic environment, our study suggests that
performance pay can be an effective approach to motivating public sector managers.

NOTES. Table uses sample of children testing anemic at baseline. Children are considered anemic if they have an altitudeadjusted hemoglobin concentration below 120 g/L (per WHO guidelines). Rows 1-5 in Panel A show estimated coefficients for
treatment group indicators and interactions obtained by estimating equation (19) (controlling for baseline hemoglobin
concentration, student age, student grade, student sex, number of students in the school, whether the school has a canteen,
student teacher ratio, distance to the furthest village served, percent of boarding students, whether the school has implemented
the "Free Lunch" policy, county dummy variables, and dummy variables for randomization strata). Standard errors are shown
in parentheses, unadjusted p-values are shown in square brackets and p-values adjusted for multiple inference are shown in
curly brackets. Adjusted p-values were constructed using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993)
with 10,000 iterations. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5% and 1% based on adjusted p-values. Panel B shows
unadjusted and adjusted p-values from tests of linear combinations of coefficients in Panel A.

NOTES. All costs in renminbi per child (exchange rate as of Sept. 2012 was 6.3 USD/RMB). Costs of the information intervention
and anemia testing are excluded as these are constant across treatments. The cost of the information intervention was 1,020 yuan
per school and the cost of anemia testing was 6.7 yuan per child. Additional administrative costs are assumed to be negligible as
administration of block grants could be built into the administration of other school finances, administrative costs of rewards into
administration of existing school administrator evaluation policies and policies, and monitoring of anemia into existing policies
stipulating annual checkups for school children. In the absence of good estimates for China (and other developing countries), the
cost of public funds is assumed to be 0.3 based on estimates for the US (Ballard, Shoven and Whalley, 1985). Social costs include
costs incurred by households and exclude incentive payments (except the deadweight loss to taxation) considering them a transfer.
Costs to households include costs of purchasing additional food and additional time spent attending parent meetings. Estimates for
additional food costs are based on estimates for impact on meat, vegetable, and fruit consumption at home reported in Appendix
Tables 5 & 6. Reported increases in times foods were consumed in the past week are assumed to be constant across all 24 weeks of
the program. Serving sizes are assumed to be half of the recommended daily consumption (25g of meat, 150g of vegetables and
100g of fruit). Food prices are based on prices in local markets as reported by the school accountant at baseline. Time spent in
parent meetings is based on estimates in Appendix Tables 7 & 8. One meeting is assumed to have an opportunity cost of 60 yuan
(approximately half of local daily wages). Anemia reduction estimates in Panel B are calculated from estimates in Table 2 and
Appendix Table 3. Effects not significant (N.S.) for the Small Block Grant, No Incentives intervention.

NOTES. Data source: baseline survey. Table uses full sample of children tested for hemoglobin concentration. Children are considered anemic if they
have an altitude-adjusted hemoglobin concentration below 120 g/L (per WHO guidelines). The first and second columns show the mean and standard
deviation in the comparison (small grant, no incentives) group. Columns 3 through 7 show coefficients and standard errors from a regression of each
characteristic on indicators for incentive and large grant treatment group indicators and there interactions, controlling for randomization strata. Column
8 shows p-values from a test that coefficients are jointly zero. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5% and 1%.

NOTES. Table uses sample of children testing anemic at baseline. Children are considered anemic if they have an
altitude-adjusted hemoglobin concentration below 120 g/L (per WHO guidelines). The dependent variable in
columns 1 and 2 is a dummy variable indicating missing hemoglobin measurements at endline. The dependent
variable in columns 3 and 4 is a dummy variable indicating missing household forms at endline conditional on a
child's hemoglobin measurement being non-missing. In addition to what is shown regressions also control for
county and randomization strata fixed effects. Standard errors are shown in parentheses, unadjusted p-values are
shown in square brackets and p-values adjusted for multiple inference are shown in curly brackets. Adjusted p2
values were constructed using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993) with 10,000
iterations. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5% and 1%. based on adjusted p-values.

NOTES. Table uses full sample of children tested for hemoglobin concentration. Rows 1-5 show estimated coefficients for treatment group indicators and interactions obtained by estimating equation (12)
(controlling for the baseline value of the dependent variable, student age, student grade, student sex, number of students in the school, whether the school has a canteen, student teacher ratio, distance to the
furthest village served, percent of boarding students, whether the school has implemented the "Free Lunch" policy, county dummy variables, and dummy variables for randomization strata). The dependent
variable in each regression is a summary index constructed using the GLS weighting procedure in Anderson (2008). Estimates for the individual components of each index are shown in Appendix Tables 5 and
6. Standard errors are shown in parentheses, unadjusted p-values are shown in square brackets and p-values adjusted for multiple inference are shown in curly brackets. Adjusted p-values were constructed
using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993) with 10,000 iterations. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5% and 1% based on adjusted p-values.

NOTES. Table uses sample of children testing anemic at baseline. Children are considered anemic if they have an altitude-adjusted hemoglobin concentration below 120 g/L (per WHO guidelines). Rows 1-5 show estimated coefficients for treatment group indicators and interactions
obtained by estimating equation (12) (controlling for the baseline value of the dependent variable, student age, student grade, student sex, number of students in the school, whether the school has a canteen, student teacher ratio, distance to the furthest village served, percent of boarding
students, whether the school has implemented the "Free Lunch" policy, county dummy variables, and dummy variables for randomization strata). Standard errors are shown in parentheses, unadjusted p-values are shown in square brackets and p-values adjusted for multiple inference across
all tests corresponding to each index are shown in curly brackets. Adjusted p-values were constructed using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993) with 10,000 iterations. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5% and 1% based on adjusted p-values.

NOTES. Table uses full sample of children tested for hemoglobin concentration. Rows 1-5 show estimated coefficients for treatment group indicators and interactions obtained by estimating equation (12) (controlling for the baseline value of the dependent
variable, student age, student grade, student sex, number of students in the school, whether the school has a canteen, student teacher ratio, distance to the furthest village served, percent of boarding students, whether the school has implemented the "Free Lunch"
policy, county dummy variables, and dummy variables for randomization strata). Standard errors are shown in parentheses, unadjusted p-values are shown in square brackets and p-values adjusted for multiple inference across all tests corresponding to each
index are shown in curly brackets. Adjusted p-values were constructed using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993) with 10,000 iterations. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5% and 1% based on adjusted p-values.

NOTES. Table uses sample of children testing anemic at baseline. Children are considered anemic if they have an altitude-adjusted hemoglobin concentration below 120 g/L (per WHO guidelines). Rows 1-5
show estimated coefficients for treatment group indicators and interactions obtained by estimating equation (19) (controlling for the baseline value of the dependent variable, student age, student grade, student
sex, number of students in the school, whether the school has a canteen, student teacher ratio, distance to the furthest village served, percent of boarding students, whether the school has implemented the "Free
Lunch" policy, county dummy variables, and dummy variables for randomization strata). The dependent variable in each regression is a summary index constructed using the GLS weighting procedure in
Anderson (2008). Estimates for the individual components of each index are shown in Appendix Tables 5 and 6. Standard errors are shown in parentheses, unadjusted p-values are shown in square brackets
and p-values adjusted for multiple inference are shown in curly brackets. Adjusted p-values were constructed
9 using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993) with 10,000 iterations.
*, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5% and 1% based on adjusted p-values. Panel B shows unadjusted and adjusted p-values from tests of linear combinations of coefficients in Panel A.

NOTES. Table uses sample of children testing anemic at baseline. Children are considered anemic if they have an altitude-adjusted
hemoglobin concentration below 120 g/L (per WHO guidelines). Panel A shows heterogeneous effects of small and large incentives
(given small grants) by low and high prosociality scores and Panel B shows heterogeneous effects by low and high intrinsic motivation
scores. Both scores are derived from psychological scales in Grant (2008) with individual responses corresponding to each scale
combined into indices using the GLS weighting procedure in Anderson (2008). Administrator scores are categorized as low if scores are
below the median in the sample at baseline and high if they are above the median. Heterogeneous effects are estimated using equation
(19) and interacting treatment dummies with indicators for high baseline prosocial or intrinsic motivation (and controlling for baseline
hemoglobin concentration, student age, student grade, student sex, number of students in the school, whether the school has a canteen,
student teacher ratio, distance to the furthest village served, percent of boarding students, whether the school has implemented the "Free
Lunch" policy, county dummy variables, and dummy variables for randomization strata). Standard errors are shown in parentheses,
unadjusted p-values are shown in square brackets and p-values adjusted for multiple inference are shown in curly brackets. Adjusted pvalues were constructed using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993) with 10,000 iterations. *, **, and

The problem

The school principal’s problem is to:

M ax{e,A} w + ✓H v(e) + S(G
s.t. w = tH + m

A)

H = f (e, A)
AG
Assuming an internal solution, the problem is equivalent to solving:
M ax{e,A}

(✓ + t)f (e, A)

v(e) + S(G

A)

The first order conditions are:
Ue ⌘ (✓ + t)fe (e, A)
UA ⌘ (✓ + t)fA (e, A)

v 0 (e) = 0
S 0 (G

A) = 0

(2)

For simplicity of notation, we suppress the arguments of the functions in the
following, so that fiij refers to fiij (e, A) for i, j = {e, A}, v 0 refers to v 0 (e), S 0
refers to S 0 (G A) and similar for the second and third order derivatives of v
and S.

Second order comparative statics

To understand when resources and incentives are complements or substitutes,
@H
is positive or negative,
we must find under what conditions the sign of @t@G
respectively. In general the second order comparative statics depend on the
third derivatives of f (e, A), S(G A), and v(e). Because interpreting the thirdorder derivatives is far from trivial, to make progress we assume that the third
derivatives of f (e, A) are zero, but allow S(G A) and v(e) unrestricted.2 Using
the chain rule on H = f (e, A), we obtain the second-order comparative statics
for H:
h

@H

following expressions further.

complex to interpret than the third derivatives of S(G A) and v(e).

The expressions (10) and (11) are complex but they can be understood if we
take into account that:
1. |H| > 0,

2. the terms that include S 000 have the same sign as the sign of S 000 ,

3. the terms that include v 000 have the opposite sign as the sign of v 000 ,
4. all other terms are negative, except
or positive.

@H
Given the above, the conditions that are more favorable to complements @t@G

@H
< 0 are: S 000 <= 0, v 000 >= 0, and
that are more favorable to substitutes @t@G
a small value of feA .
