JEL No. I1,J1
ABSTRACT
While recent research finds strong evidence that birth order affects children’s outcomes such as education,
IQ scores, and earnings, the evidence for effects on health is more limited. This paper uses a large
dataset on the population of Norway and focuses on the effect of birth order on a range of health and
health-related behaviors, outcomes not previously available in datasets of this magnitude. Interestingly,
we find complicated effects of birth order. First-borns are more likely to be overweight, to be obese,
and to have high blood pressure and high triglycerides. So, unlike education or earnings, there is no
clear first-born advantage in health. However, later-borns are more likely to smoke and have poorer
self-reported physical and mental health. They are also less likely to report that they are happy. We
find that these effects are largely unaffected by conditioning on education and earnings, suggesting
that these are not the only important pathways to health differentials by birth order. When we explore
possible mechanisms, we find that smoking early in pregnancy is more prevalent for first pregnancies
than for later ones. However, women are more likely to quit smoking during their first pregnancy than
during later ones, and first-borns are more likely to be breast-fed. These findings suggest a role for
early maternal investment in determining birth order effects on health.

Newspapers and magazines are replete with articles describing how you can predict your
future based on your birth order - what job you are likely to do, what personality characteristics
you exhibit, even so far as to predict how you will raise your children.1 Though these articles
often seem more circus show than academic, there is substantial research across a variety of
fields examining the relationship between birth order and individual outcomes. Although early
work was limited in its ability to distinguish birth order from other confounding characteristics
such as family size (for example, third born children on average come from larger families than
first born children), recent work has taken advantage of large survey and administrative datasets
to consistently find that, in developed countries, first-borns have higher IQ scores, educational
attainment, and earnings than later-borns.2
There is a sizeable literature about the relationship between birth order and adult health.
However, individual studies have typically examined only one or a small number of health
outcomes and, in many cases, have used relatively small samples. In this paper, we use large
nationally representative data from Norway to identify the relationship between birth order and
health, where health is measured along a number of dimensions, including medical indicators,
health behaviors, and overall life satisfaction. In light of existing work documenting that
firstborns have greater education and earnings, studying a range of health outcomes provides a
more complete picture of the role of birth order on child success.
Until recently, the identification of birth order effects has been limited due to the rigorous
data demands required for credible estimation. Later-born children are only observed in larger
families (by definition), and the characteristics of individuals who choose to have larger families
are observably quite different from those of individuals who choose to have smaller families. To

circumvent these issues, we use a large dataset from Norway and estimate the effects of birth
order on health using a family fixed effects specification. In this case, we are identifying the
effects of birth order by comparing siblings within the same family, thereby eliminating concerns
that birth order is picking up omitted family characteristics such as family size. We are also able
to control for mother’s and children’s birth cohorts—in this case, birth order effects are identified
off the differential timing of births within the same family. We find effects of health on birth
order that are complicated. First-borns are more likely to be overweight and have high blood
pressure and high triglycerides. However, later-borns are more likely to smoke and have poorer
self-reported physical and mental health. These results are found in both between-family (crosssectional) and within-family analysis. So, unlike education or earnings, there is no clear firstborn advantage in health. Also, we find that these effects are largely unaffected by conditioning
on education and earnings, suggesting that these are not the only important pathways to health
differentials by birth order.
There are many mechanisms that could generate a relationship between birth order and
health, including differences in biological endowments, early parental investment, and later
parental or environmental factors. While we cannot examine all possible mechanisms, we focus
on the role of early parental investment behavior, as much recent research has highlighted the
importance of early investments (both in utero and in the first years of life) for the long-run
outcomes of children (see Aizer and Currie 2014 for a summary). In particular, using a variety of
data sources, we examine the effects of a child's birth order on maternal smoking during
pregnancy and the probability that he/she is breastfed as both these parental behaviors are likely
to have long-term implications for the health of the child.
We find that smoking early in pregnancy is more prevalent for first pregnancies than for
later ones. However, women are more likely to quit smoking during their first pregnancy than

3

during later ones, and first borns are more likely to be breast-fed. These findings suggest a role
for early maternal investment in determining birth order effects on health.
The paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3
discusses the data we use and Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 discusses possible
mechanisms, and Section 6 concludes.

2. Related Literature
A number of literatures have examined the relationship between birth order and health or
health behaviors, ranging from the medical literature to sociology to psychology to economics
(for instance Richiardi et al., 2004, Sulloway, 1996, and Argys et al., 2006).

While much of the

research has used relatively small samples, there are several papers that have utilized population
registers like the Norwegian data we use.
Recent work by Lundborg, Ralsmark, and Olof-Rooth (2014) examines the relationship
between family size, birth order, and height, where height is used as a proxy for health. Using
military enlistment data from Sweden covering the population of males at approximately 18 years
of age, the authors show that there are large and statistically significant negative effects of birth
order on height. However, while height is often used as a proxy for health in developing
countries, it is a more limited measure in a developed country such as Sweden.3
Barclay and Kolk (2013) and Modin (2002) also use register data from Sweden but focus
on the relationship between birth order and mortality. They find that mortality risk increases with
birth order, and this pattern is stronger for women than for men. Additionally, a few papers have
examined the relationship between birth order and suicide and found a positive relationship (see

3

Hatton and Martin (2010) also find negative effects of higher birth order on height of children in Britain in the
1930s.

4

Rostila et al, 2014 and references therein).4 While these studies represent an important
contribution to our understanding, mortality is clearly an extreme measure of health. In addition,
the authors lack more nuanced information on health behaviors and on mental health. Our
findings of birth order differences in smoking behavior suggest a plausible contributor to
mortality differences and our mental health findings provide context to the findings about suicide
in the literature.
Using register data on Swedish conscripts aged about 19, Jelenkovic et al. (2013) find no
evidence that birth order affects blood pressure but find that it negatively affects BMI. We build
on this research by examining blood pressure, BMI, and obesity in addition to health behavior
and mental health indicators, in a sample of prime age adults.
Moving beyond register data, researchers have used smaller cross-sectional and cohort
datasets to study various health outcomes. For example, Howe et al. (2014) use cohort data from
Brazil and the UK and find no consistent evidence for any relationship between birth order and
blood pressure or obesity. However, a key limitation of much of this research is the absence of
large-scale data sources required to sufficiently control for across-family differences (in
particular, family size and its correlates) and the failure of many studies to control for
confounders such as cohort effects and mothers age at the birth of the child. Our main
contribution is to examine a wide range of health outcomes on a large common sample and using
appropriate sets of control variables.
We also study an area about which little is known -- the relationship between birth order
and adult health behavior. Much more is known about the relationship between birth order and
health-related behaviors of children and teenagers. Argys et al. (2006) use the NLSY to show
that, among adolescents, later-borns are more likely than first-borns to use alcohol and drugs and
4

Swedish register data have also been used to study the relationship between birth order and cancer (Bevier et al.
2011; Hemminki and Mutanen 2001) with findings of positive birth order effects on some cancers (such as lung
cancer) and negative birth order effects for others (such as endometrial cancer).

engage in risky sexual behaviour. In related work, Rees et al. (2008) showed that later-born boys
were more likely to participate in sports in 10th grade but the opposite was true for later-born
girls.5 Our analysis shows that some of these behavioral differences persist well into adulthood
and so are likely to have important consequences for health.
In terms of mechanisms underlying observed differences in outcomes by birth order, there
are a number of papers examining variation in parental investment behavior. Work by Price
(2008) and Monfardini and See (2012) examine parental time spent with children and find
differences by birth order. Lehmann et al. (2014), among others, show that birth order differences
in cognitive achievement appear early in life (as early as age 2), suggesting the importance of
early parental investments. Using the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
dataset (CNLSY), they show that later-borns experience a lower reduction in cigarette usage
during pregnancy, are breastfed less often, and experience less cognitive stimulation and
emotional support at ages 0 to 1. Buckles and Kolka (2014) show similar patterns in
breastfeeding by birth order using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). We show
similar results for Norway using larger sample sizes. An advantage of the Norwegian Birth
Registers is that they have information on smoking in both early and late pregnancy and so
enable us to study changes in smoking behavior over the course of pregnancy. Also, the smoking
data are probably more reliable than the retrospective self-reports in the CNLSY.

3. Data
Data are compiled from a number of different sources. Our primary data source is the
Norwegian Registry Data, a linked administrative dataset that covers the population of
Norwegians from 1986 to 2010. These data are maintained by Statistics Norway and provide

In addition, two interesting papers provide evidence that parents may strategically be stricter to first-borns than
later-borns (Hao et al., 2008; Hotz and Pantano, 2013).

information about labor market status, earnings, and a set of demographic variables (age, gender)
as well as information on families.
We measure family size in the register by using personal identifiers matched between
parents and children to count the children of each mother, and we use information on year and
month of birth to assign birth order. We drop twins from our estimating samples because of the
ambiguities involved in calculating birth order for twins. We also drop only children and families
with 6 or more children from the sample so family sizes range from 2 to 5.6 Appendix Table 1
presents summary statistics for our sample. Most families in our sample (75%) have two or three
children. In our sample, 44% of children are first-borns, 38% are second-borns, 14% are thirdborns and 5% are fourth- or fifth-borns.
These data are merged to health survey data using personal identification numbers. The
health data come from two population-based surveys carried out between 1988 and 2003 and
covering all counties in Norway: the Cohort of Norway (CONOR) and the National Health
Screening Service’s Age 40 Program. Both surveys were conducted by the National Institute of
Public Health, and for the most part, the same information was collected in both surveys. Both
consist of two components: the survey and the health examination. The survey includes
questions about specific diseases, general questions about health, medicine use, family disease
history, physical activity, and smoking and drinking habits. The health examination includes
blood pressure measurement and blood tests for cholesterol and blood sugar.
Most of the health data come from the Age 40 Program, which covers all counties in
Norway except Oslo and includes men and women aged 40-42 who were surveyed sometime
between 1988-1999.7 The survey was conducted county by county and all of the inhabitants in
each county aged 40-42 were surveyed. Because of the scope of the project, it took a number of
6

Fewer than 4% of families have 6 or more children. We also drop women whose age at first birth is less than 16 or
greater than 45 (only 9 observations are dropped as a result). The results are robust to these choices.
7
The Age 40 Program dataset is described at http://www.fhi.no and in studies such as Jacobsen, Stensvold,
Fylkesnes, Kristiansen and Thelle (1992) and Nystad, Meyer, Nafstad, Tverdal and Engeland (2004).

years to cover all counties; as a result, different counties were surveyed in different years. Each
county was surveyed only once. All 40-42 year olds were asked to participate, and the response
rate is about 70 percent, yielding 374,090 observations.
To this, we add the smaller CONOR dataset.8 The main advantage of the CONOR dataset
is that it includes Oslo, which was omitted from the Age 40 data. The CONOR dataset has
56,863 respondents from a wider set of age groups and collected between 1994 and 2003. It
consists of 10 different surveys across different age groups and counties. The response rate is
similar but a little lower (60 percent) compared to that of the Age 40 Program. The Oslo survey
was conducted in 2000 and 2001, where they sampled all 40, 45 and 46 year olds, in addition to
30/31 and 59/60 year olds. Because the surveys were mostly conducted in the 1990s and early
2000s and were focused on persons in their early 40s, we restrict the sample to cohorts born
between 1940 and 1960 who are aged between 35 and 60 at the time of the survey.9
Because of non-response and the fact that different cohorts were sampled in different
municipalities, we observe only 41% of the complete 1940-1960 cohorts in the health surveys. A
concern is that selection into our sample may be related to individual health, and to the extent that
it is also correlated with birth order, this may introduce bias into our analysis. While we think
this is unlikely to be a problem, we use the population of these cohorts and regress an indicator of
whether one has health information on birth order and on the other control variables described in
the next section along with mother fixed effects. Although we find statistically significant
effects-- first-borns are 0.6% less likely to participate than second-borns and 1% less likely to

8

The CONOR data set is described on the web page www.fhi.no/conor/index.html or in Søgaard (2006), and several
studies have used parts or the total sample including Søgaard, Bjelland, Telle and Røysamb (2003).

9

86% of survey respondents were born between 1940 and 1960 so this cohort restriction allows us to keep most
people while still having a relatively homogenous sample. We lose an additional 660 observations by restricting to
persons aged between 35 and 60. Our results are similar when these sample restrictions are not imposed.

participate than third borns--these differences are sufficiently small that they are unlikely to lead
to large biases in estimation.10

4. Birth Order Analysis
Credible identification of birth order effects has stringent data requirements; the fact that
later born children are more likely to come from larger families, be born to older parents, and be
born later chronologically highlights the importance of controlling for family size, parental age,
and child cohort effects when using cross-family variation. With sufficient sample sizes and
appropriate controls, however, the cross-sectional evidence can be quite compelling.
To estimate the relationship between birth order and health, we regress health on birth
order indicators along with a variety of other controls. To avoid any confounding family size
effects, we include indicator variables for each possible family size. In addition to family size, the
control variables include gender, indicator variables for cohort (year of birth), indicator variables
for year of health exam, and indicator variables for age of mother at birth, and for age of mother
at first birth. We also include survey dummies in case measurement differed in any way across
surveys.
An additional advantage of our dataset is that we can test the sensitivity of our results to
within-family comparisons. We do the within-family comparison by estimating specifications
using mother fixed effects. We include the same control variables as in OLS, except that now
family size and mother’s age at first birth drop out as they are the same for all children in the
same family.11 In this case, we are estimating the relative performance of different children (with
different birth orders) within the same family.

10

Previous studies have found little indication of self-selection on observable family background variables in
CONOR when compared to the whole population (Søgaard, Selmer, Bjertnes, Thelle, 2003).
11
Even when looking within family, we still face the issue that parents of later-born children are older, and later born
children belong to different cohorts, suggesting the need to also include indicators for mother’s age at birth and

9

The mother fixed effects specifications are our preferred estimates as they are robust to
any family-specific unobservable characteristics. However, because this strategy is identified
from families with at least 2 children, the OLS estimates (without mother fixed effects) are for a
less-selected sample. Therefore, for completeness, we report both sets of results and, importantly,
they provide similar estimates.12
We split our health outcomes into three groups—health measures, health behaviors, and
overall life satisfaction.

Health Measures
We first examine the effect of birth order on a variety of health variables. From blood
samples, we have indicators for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides.
Following the National Institute of Health (NIH - http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/healthtopics/topics/hbp/), we define a person as having high blood pressure if the systolic number is
greater than or equal to 140mmHg or the diastolic number is greater than or equal to 90mmHg.13
For cholesterol, we once again follow the NIH in defining high cholesterol as total serum
cholesterol greater than or equal to 240 mg/dL (6.2mmol/l). Finally, triglycerides are a type of
fat found in blood. Following the classification by the American Heart Association, we define
high triglycerides as having a level higher than 2.25mmol/l. High blood pressure, high
cholesterol, and high triglycerides are all considered by the American Heart Association to be
major risk factors for heart disease.

child’s cohort of birth. In practice, only cohort controls are required as, conditional on the mother fixed effects,
mother’s age at birth is perfectly correlated with child’s birth cohort.
12
We have also verified that OLS estimates on a sample of families with at least 2 participating children are quite
similar to the OLS estimates reported.
13
"Blood pressure" is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps
blood. "Systolic" refers to blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood. "Diastolic" refers to blood
pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.

10

We also have data on physical measurements taken during the examination -- height,
weight, and indicators for whether an individual is overweight or obese. Height is measured in
centimeters and weight is reported in kilograms; from these we construct Body Mass Index
(BMI) as weight divided by height (in meters) squared. As is standard, we define a person as
being overweight if their BMI is greater than or equal to 25 and as being obese if their BMI is
greater than or equal to 30.14
The results for these outcomes are presented in Table 1.15 Because we have many
outcome variables, we report our main estimates pooling both across family sizes and by gender.
However, these estimates are quite representative, as we find that birth order effects generally do
not differ significantly by gender or across family size.16 The omitted birth order category is firstborn so all birth order coefficients are the effects relative to first-borns. Importantly, the results
show that the estimates are not very sensitive to specification choice; the within-family estimates
are generally similar to those using cross-sectional variation, suggesting that the estimated birth
order effects do not reflect omitted family characteristics. However, given our greater faith in the
fixed effects estimates, we focus on these when reporting coefficient values.
We find that the probability of having high blood pressure declines with birth order, and
the largest gap is between first- and second-borns. Second-borns are about 3% less likely to have
high blood pressure than first-borns; fifth-borns are about 7% less likely to have high blood
pressure than first-borns. Given the proportion with high blood pressure is 24%, this is quite a
large difference. In contrast, there is little evidence of birth order effects on cholesterol in either
specification. However, there is strong evidence that the probability of having high triglycerides

14

These are the definitions of overweight and obesity used by the World Health Organization (WHO):
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/.
15
When we study binary dependent variables, such as whether the person has high blood pressure, we estimate linear
probability models. We estimate the standard errors using the Huber/White heteroskedasticity-robust estimator
clustered at the level of the person’s mother. This allows for arbitrary correlation of errors within sibling groups.

11

is greater for first-borns than for second- or third-borns with the difference between first- and
second-borns being about 2%. This compares to a baseline of 22% with high triglycerides.
The estimates for height show that height is decreasing with birth order. First-borns are,
on average, about 0.2 of a centimeter taller than second-borns. The effect seems monotonic, with
fifth-borns being--depending on specification--between .4 and .8 of a centimeter shorter than
first-borns on average.17 While first-borns are taller, they are also more likely to be overweight
and obese. Compared to second-borns, first-borns are 4% more likely to be overweight, and 2%
more likely to be obese. The equivalent differences between fifth-borns and first-borns are 10%
and 5%. For context, the proportions in the population that are overweight and obese are 47%
and 10% respectively. So, once again, these magnitudes are quite large. Overall, we find that
first-borns are less healthy in terms of physical markers such as blood pressure, triglycerides, and
indicators of overweight and obesity.18

Health-Related Behaviors
We also study several health-related behaviors. The first set is whether the individual is a
daily smoker and the number of cigarettes smoked daily. Smoking is an important risk factor for
heart disease, lung cancer, and many other ailments. Another variable is the number of alcoholic
drinks consumed in the two weeks prior to the survey. This is the sum of beer, wine, and hard
liquor consumption. While moderate drinking may not have adverse health effects, heavy
drinking is known to have negative consequences for health (see for example Corder et al.,
2006). For men, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming 15 drinks or more per week,

17

These findings for height are similar to those reported for Sweden by Lundborg et al. (2014).
Another health-related outcome is receiving disability benefit. Given that only 4% of our sample are in receipt of
this benefit and it is contingent on labor-market factors (and so affected by factors other than health), we do not
report estimates for it. However, analogous estimation shows that first-borns are less likely to receive disability
benefits.
18

12

and for women, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming 8 drinks or more per week.19
Therefore, we also create a binary indicator for whether the man (woman) was a heavy drinker
based on these definitions. Questions about drinking were not asked in all of the health surveys
so our sample sizes for these variables are much lower than for smoking.20 The survey also
contains a question about frequency of exercise. We create a binary variable that is one if the
person exercises at least one hour per week and zero otherwise.21
Table 2 presents the estimated effects of birth order on these health-related behaviors. We
can see that the number of cigarettes smoked daily increases monotonically with birth order –
first-borns smoke about 0.5 fewer cigarettes per day than second-borns and about 1 to 1.5 fewer
cigarettes than fifth-borns. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day is only 5 so again
these birth order effects are quite large. The findings for whether the person smokes daily are
qualitatively similar, with first-borns 5% less likely to smoke than second-borns and about 13%
less likely to smoke than 5th-borns (38% of our sample smoke daily). Our smoking findings
suggest that the higher prevalence of smoking by later-borns found among adolescents in the U.S.
by Argys et al. (2006) may persist throughout adulthood and, hence, have important effects on
health outcomes.22
In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that later-borns drink more alcohol than firstborns or that birth order is related to exercise. As mentioned earlier, our sample sizes are lower
for these variables but the standard errors are still low enough to rule out large effects.23

19

http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm#excessivealcohol
We face the same issue with several other variables including exercise, self-reported health, reported happiness,
and questions about mental health.
21
The question for weekly exercise is coded as "nothing", "<1 hour", "1-2 hours", and "3+ hours". We create a
binary variable that is one for either of the latter two categories and zero for the first two. Our results are not
sensitive to how we code the exercise variable.
22
Since smoking tends to reduce BMI, we have examined whether controlling for cigarettes smoked affects the birth
order effects for obesity. We found that it made very little difference to the coefficients.
23
One concern might be that there are very few families who have multiple children in these smaller samples,
leading to the fixed effects specifications being identified from very few children. For the drinking variables, there
are 18805 mothers who have multiple children with non-missing data in the sample (they have 39252 children in the
20

13

Self-Reported Physical and Mental Health
Finally, we also study a set of self-reported health measures. The first is an indicator
variable for whether the person considered himself to be in good or very good health, while the
other three variables proxy for mental health. The first two mental health variables are created
from answers to a series of questions about whether the person was irritable, lonely, nervous,
anxious, calm, or depressed during the last two weeks. We have used these answers to create an
index for mental ill-health.24 This variable takes values between 1 and 4 (with higher numbers
indicating worse mental health) and has a standard deviation of .42. We have also taken a simpler
approach of creating a binary variable that is 1 if a person felt more than a little nervous, anxious,
irritated or depressed or if they didn’t feel calm or felt only a little calm. Only 21% of people are
allocated a one for this variable.25 Our final measure is not really a health measure at all--it is a
measure of whether the individual is happy—but may serve as a proxy for good physical and
mental health.
Table 3 shows estimates for these health measures. The first one is an indicator variable
for whether the person considered himself to be in good or very good health. Later-borns are less
likely to consider themselves to be in good health. The difference between a first- and secondborn is about 1.5% from a base of 85%.
When we turn to mental health, we see that mental health generally declines with birth
order. When we examine the mental health index, where higher values suggest worse mental

sample). While this is substantially fewer than for the smoking variables (69480 mothers), it is still a large sample
size.
24
Respondents are asked separate questions about how irritable, lonely, nervous, anxious, calm, or depressed they
were during the last two weeks. They were asked “Did you feel #### during the last two weeks?” and the possible
answers were {no, a little, a lot, very much}. For irritable, lonely, nervous, anxious, and depressed, we code the
answers as {1, 2, 3, 4} respectively. For calm, we code the answers as {4, 3, 2, 1}. Then we construct the index by
taking the average of the six numbers for each person. Therefore, the index has a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4
and higher values of the index imply poorer mental health.
25
We have tried other ways of aggregating the answers from these questions to create an index of mental wellbeing
and found similar birth order patterns.

14

health, we see that, although not all estimates are statistically significant, the coefficients
generally suggest that mental health declines with birth order. We get qualitatively similar
estimates when we use the binary measure of mental illness. Finally, we find that later-borns are
less happy, with second-borns being about 2% and fifth-borns being about 8% less likely to say
that they are happy than first-borns. These are relative to a mean of 77% for our sample.26

Possible Mechanisms
What can explain the birth order effects we find? One possibility is that health is affected
by education and earnings and these are a pathway through which birth order influences health. It
is well established that health tends to improve with education and earnings (See, for example,
Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010). We have verified that the effects of birth order on education and
earnings in our sample are consistent with what prior research has found – first-borns have higher
average education and earnings than later-borns – so this is a plausible explanation for poorer
health outcomes of later-borns. However, it cannot explain the fact that later-borns have better
health along some dimensions such as having lower risk of high blood pressure and obesity. We
have re-estimated the birth order regressions adding controls for education and earnings in order
to get a sense of how important they might be in determining the birth order effects.27 As
expected, we find that including these controls has the effect of improving the relative health of
26

All family size estimates in the tables are the effects relative to 2-child families. Although we would not want to
push for a causal interpretation of the family size coefficients (due to likely omitted variable bias), it is interesting to
note the patterns we observe. Because poorer people tend to have larger families, we expect that true causal effects
of family size to be no more negative than OLS estimates. This is consistent with most family size findings from the
developed world including our own findings on the effects of family size on education using twin births and sex
composition as instruments (Black, Devereux and Salvanes, 2005). Therefore, it is interesting that the estimated
family size effects in Tables 1-3 do not consistently demonstrate that bigger families have worse health – in fact,
people from larger families are less likely to have high blood pressure, less likely to have high triglycerides, and less
likely to be overweight or obese. They also smoke fewer cigarettes and drink less alcohol. The only variable that
points to positive health benefits of coming from a smaller family is height – persons from four and five child
families are shorter than those from 2-child families.
27

We include dummy variables for each education level (completed years of schooling), plus a dummy for having
positive earnings in 1995 (when sample members are aged between 35 and 55) and a control for earnings in 1995.
We have tried alternative specifications for these variables and found similar results.

later-borns relative to first-borns. However, the changes are not very large. For example, the
blood pressure advantage of 5th borns over 1st borns increases from 0.07 to 0.08, the analogous
obesity advantage increases from 0.05 to 0.054, the smoking difference falls from 1.58 to 1.24,
and the difference in value of the mental illness index falls from 0.074 to 0.067. So, while
education and earnings appear to be part of the story here, the birth order patterns are largely
unchanged when they are added as control variables.
Birth order effects could also have biological origins. For example, the in-utero
programming hypothesis suggests that the maternal immune system changes with the number of
births and that this affects the child in utero and subsequently (Ohfuji et al., 2009). Also, it is well
established that birth weight tends to increase with parity so first-borns are, on average, lighter at
birth than their siblings. (See, for example, Juntunen, Läärä & Kauppila, 1997 and Wilcox,
Chang & Johnson, 1996.) While the long-term consequences of this are unclear, it may be part of
the explanation of the greater propensity of first-borns to be obese (Wells et al. 2011).
Additionally, the higher-blood pressure of first-borns may be related to their greater BMI.
Another potential mechanism is personality. While the empirical evidence is not
particularly strong, there is an established set of theories about birth order and personality. Firstborns are often perceived to be intense and career-orientated while later-borns are considered to
be more laid back and creative (Sulloway, 1996, Zweigenhaf and von Ammen, 2000).28 This
provides a possible set of explanations for these findings. High blood pressure and triglycerides
may be caused by the stress that results from this driven, competitive personality type. However,
we do not have any data that allow us to examine this possibility further.
Given the recent attention to the role of early parental investments on long-run children’s
outcomes, we will focus our attention here on two health-related decisions made by the mother
while pregnant or soon after the birth of her child. To do so, we introduce a variety of new
28

Recent work using administrative data from Sweden suggests that first-borns are more likely to be managers. See
Black, Gronqvist and Ockert (2015).

datasets. Note, however, that this new information is unavailable for the cohorts for whom we
have health information, so we cannot evaluate the role of these factors in determining the health
effects we have found thus far.

Parental Investments in Utero
One potential explanation for health differences by birth order is that parents invest
differentially during pregnancy. For example, smoking during pregnancy has been shown to be
extremely harmful to the fetus (Rubin et al., 1986, Bernstein et al., 2005). Although we have no
information on maternal behavior during pregnancy for the individuals sampled in the health
survey, there is information in the Birth Register on smoking behavior of mothers who give birth
between 1999 and 2009. Women are asked whether and how much they smoked both at the
beginning and at the end of pregnancy. Women report smoking status at the start of the
pregnancy to doctors at a free, recommended consultation around gestational week 8-12 (some
women report it slightly later because their first consultation is after week 12). They are asked not
only about smoking status (yes/no) but also how many cigarettes per day they smoke. The birth
register also contains information on smoking behavior at the end of pregnancy collected during a
pre-birth hospital visit around gestational week 36. The response rate in our data for this smoking
question is 83% at the beginning of pregnancy and 79% at the end.29
Table 4 presents the estimates when we examine whether smoking behavior depends on
the birth order of the in-utero child. We use the same control variables as in the previous
estimation of health effects.30 The OLS and FE estimates are similar and, as before, we will focus
on the FE ones. These estimates imply that mothers are about 4% more likely to smoke at the
beginning of their first pregnancy than for their second or third birth. Given the mean value of the
29

We have created a variable for whether smoking information is missing and used it as a dependent variable to see
whether reporting is related to birth order. We found no evidence for any relationship.
30
Note that our family size measure here is family size in 2009 and, unlike in the previous regressions, may not
represent completed family size for these women.

17

dependent variable is 14%, this is a sizeable effect. However, the pattern is actually reversed by
the end of the pregnancy, with mothers now less likely to smoke on their first pregnancy. These
patterns for smoking incidence are also found when we study the number of cigarettes smoked in
columns 3 and 4.
We next take the sample of mothers who smoked at the beginning of pregnancy and
examine whether their decision to quit during pregnancy is related to the birth order of the child
(37% of smokers at the beginning of pregnancy no longer smoke at the end). Column 5 shows
these results; we find that mothers are much less likely to quit smoking during later pregnancies
than during their first pregnancy. Finally, in column 6, we find the same pattern when we include
all women and study the change in the number of cigarettes smoked between the beginning and
end of pregnancy.
Taken together, our smoking findings paint a complicated picture. First-borns are more
likely to be exposed to smoke during early pregnancy than later-borns but less likely to be
exposed later in pregnancy. Thus, the health effects are not clear-cut. However, what is clear is
that behavioral responses by mothers differ by birth order in a way that is favorable to first-borns
-- parents are more likely to quit smoking during pregnancy for first-born children than for
subsequent ones.31

Parental Investments in Childhood
Birth order effects could also be the result of differential parental behaviors post-birth.
Again, although we do not have data on early parental investments for our health sample, we do
observe information on breast feeding behavior for later cohorts and can examine whether
mothers breastfeed first-borns for longer than later-borns. Although there are some recent papers
31

This is consistent with the work by Lehmann et al. (2014). Using the CNLSY, they find no statistically significant
effects of the child’s birth order on number of cigarettes smoked but, like us, they find evidence that mothers of laterborns are less likely to reduce their smoking during pregnancy.

18

examining the relationship between birth order and breastfeeding in the US and Ecuador
(Lehmann et al, 2014; Buckles and Kolka, 2014; De Haan et al.,2014), it is useful to examine in
the context of Norway, where rates of breastfeeding are very high.32
In the CONOR dataset, we can observe the breastfeeding decisions, including incidence
and duration for each child of the surveyed women. We merge the information for each child
with birth registers that are available for children born from 1967 onwards. This gives us
information on 42425 children born to 17554 mothers. Descriptive statistics for this sample are in
Appendix Table 3.
The estimates are presented in Table 5. The dependent variable in the first column is
duration of breastfeeding (in months); the second column adds a control for birth weight, as this
may have an independent effect on breastfeeding and also has been shown to affect later
outcomes (Black et al., 2007). Columns 3 and 4 have the equivalent estimates where the
dependent variable is whether breastfeeding lasts at least 6 months. Both OLS and mother fixed
effects estimates show that later-borns are breastfed for less time than first-borns.33 The effect
sizes get slightly bigger once birth weight is controlled for, as heavier babies are more likely to
be breastfed and first-borns are, on average, lighter than later-borns.34

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we have used large health surveys linked to population registers to study
the relationship between birth order and health and health behaviors. Unlike findings in the
literature for education and cognitive skills in developed countries, we do not find a clear first32

Breastfeeding is very common in Norway with the average duration of breastfeeding being 7 months and only
about 7% of mothers do not breastfeed at all.
33
Lehmann et al. (2014) find a similar pattern using the CNLSY as do Buckles and Kolka (2014) using the NLSY
(they also find mothers are more likely to receive first trimester care and take pre-natal vitamins during their first
pregnancy). De Haan et al. (2014) find the opposite -- first borns are breastfed for less time -- in their study of
Ecuador.
34
Table 5 also includes family size estimates. These show that children from larger families are more likely to be
breastfed, suggesting that coming from a larger family has no adverse effects on parental investments.

born advantage in health. On average, later-borns have lower blood pressure, triglycerides, and
BMI than first-borns.
Despite these findings, first-borns appear to have better health in other dimensions. They
have better self-reported physical and mental health, and they are more likely to report being
happy. They are also much less likely to smoke. The smoking finding is consistent with a
continuation of a pattern of poorer health behaviors by later-borns identified by previous research
on adolescents. Given the negative long-term health effects of smoking, it is also consistent with
the higher mortality rates found for later-borns in the previous literature. Additionally, our
finding that first-borns have better mental health may provide a partial explanation for the lower
suicide rates found in the prior literature for this group.
Because of the likely importance of early investments in determining adult health, we
have also examined how smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding depend on the birth order
of the child. Our findings generally corroborate ongoing research in this area that suggests greater
parental investment in first-borns. While this analysis is suggestive, further research will be
required to further untangle the various mechanisms underlying the complicated relationship
between birth order and adult health.

Mental Health Index: Respondents are asked separate questions about how irritable, lonely, nervous, anxious, calm,
or depressed they were during the last two weeks. They were asked “Did you feel #### during the last two weeks?”
and the possible answers were {no, a little, a lot, very much}. For irritable, lonely, nervous, anxious, and depressed,
we code the answers as {1, 2, 3, 4} respectively. For calm, we code the answers as {4, 3, 2, 1}. Then we construct
the index by taking the average of the six numbers for each person.
