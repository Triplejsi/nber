ABSTRACT
The propagation of macroeconomic shocks through input-output and geographic networks can be a
powerful driver of macroeconomic fluctuations. We first exposit that in the presence of Cobb-Douglas
production functions and consumer preferences, there is a specific pattern of economic transmission
whereby demand-side shocks propagate upstream (to input-supplying industries) and supply-side
shocks propagate downstream (to customer industries) and that there is a tight relationship between
the direct impact of a shock and the magnitudes of the downstream and the upstream indirect effects.
We then investigate the short-run propagation of four different types of industry-level shocks: two
demand-side ones (the exogenous component of the variation in industry imports from China and
changes in federal spending) and two supply-side ones (TFP shocks and variation in knowledge/ideas
coming from foreign patenting). In each case, we find substantial propagation of these shocks through
the input-output network, with a pattern broadly consistent with theory. Quantitatively, the networkbased propagation is larger than the direct effects of the shocks. We also show quantitatively large
effects from the geographic network, capturing the fact that the local propagation of a shock to an
industry will fall more heavily on other industries that tend to collocate with it across local markets.
Our results suggest that the transmission of various different types of shocks through economic
networks and industry interlinkages could have first-order implications for the macroeconomy.

Introduction

How small shocks are ampli…ed and propagated through the economy to cause sizable ‡uctuations is at the heart of much macroeconomic research. Potential mechanisms that have
been proposed range from investment and capital accumulation responses in real business cycle models (e.g., Kydland and Prescott, 1982), to Keynesian multipliers (e.g., Diamond, 1982,
Kiyotaki, 1988, Blanchard and Kiyotaki, 1987, Hall, 2009, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo, 2011), to credit market frictions facing …rms, households or banks (e.g., Bernanke and
Gertler, 1989, Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997, Guerrieri and Lorenzoni, 2012, Mian and Su…, 2013),
to the role of real and nominal rigidities and their interplay (Ball and Romer, 1990), and to
the consequences of (potentially inappropriate or constrained) monetary policy (e.g., Friedman
and Schwartz, 1971, Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003, Farhi and Werning, 2013).
A class of potentially-promising approaches based on the spread of small shocks from …rms
or disaggregated sectors through their economic and other links to other units in the economy
has generally been overlooked, however. The idea is simple. A shock to a single …rm (or
sector) could have a much larger impact on the macroeconomy if it reduces the output of
not only this …rm (or sector), but also of others that are connected to it through a network
of input-output linkages. The macroeconomic importance of this idea was downplayed by
Lucas’s (1977) famous essay on business cycles on the basis of the argument that if shocks
that hit …rms or disaggregated sectors are idiosyncratic, they would then wash out when
we aggregate across these units and look at macroeconomic ‡uctuations — due to a law of
large numbers-type argument. Despite this powerful dismissal, this class of approaches has
attracted recent theoretical attention. An important paper by Gabaix (2011) showed that
when the …rm-size distribution has very fat tails, so that shocks hitting the larger …rms cannot
be balanced out by those a¤ecting smaller …rms, the law of large numbers need not apply,
opening the way to sizable macroeconomic ‡uctuations from idiosyncratic …rm-level shocks.1
Carvalho (2008), Acemoglu, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi (2010, 2014), Acemoglu, Carvalho,
Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi (2012) and Baqaee (2015) built on the multi-sector framework …rst
developed by Long and Plosser (1983) to show how input-output linkages can also neutralize the
force of the law of large numbers because shocks hitting sectors that are particularly important
as suppliers to other sectors will not wash out and can translate into aggregate ‡uctuations.
One attractive aspect of these network-based approaches to the ampli…cation and propagation of shocks is that they naturally lend themselves to an empirical analysis that can inform
the importance of the proposed mechanisms, and the current paper undertakes such an empirical investigation. We are not the …rst to empirically study these interactions. One branch of

Earlier contributions on this theme include Jovanovic (1987) and Durlauf (1993) who showed how idiosyncratic shocks can accumulate into aggregate risk in the presence of strong strategic complementarities, and Bak,
Chen, Scheinkman and Woodford (1993) who proposed a model of macroeconomic “self-organized criticality”
capable of generating macroeconomic ‡uctuations from small shocks due to nonlinear interactions between …rms
and industries.

existing research has provided model-based quantitative evaluation of the importance of these
interactions (e.g., Horvath, 1998, 2000, Carvalho, 2008, Foerster, Sarte and Watson, 2011). A
number of recent papers have instead focused on observable large shocks to a set of …rms or
industries and have traced their impact through the input-output network. Acemoglu, Autor,
Dorn, Hanson and Price (2015) do this focusing on the spread of the impact of increased Chinese competition into the U.S. economy through input-output linkages and local labor markets,
though focusing on 10-year or 20-year e¤ects. Boehm, Flaaen and Nayar (2014), Barrot and
Sauvagnat (2014), and Carvalho, Nirei and Saito (2014) focus on the transmission of natural
disasters, such as the 2011 Japanese earthquake, over the global input-output network.2 Our
paper contributes to this literature by studying the spread of four di¤erent types of shocks
through the U.S. input-output network at business cycle frequencies. We also add to this by
evaluating the contribution of the “geographic network” of industries — which measures the
collocation patterns of industries across di¤erent commuting zones — to the inter-industry
propagation of macroeconomic shocks.3
We begin by developing some theoretical implications of the propagation of shocks through
the input-output linkages. Most notably, theory predicts that supply-side (productivity) shocks
propagate downstream much more powerfully than upstream — meaning that downstream
customers of directly-hit industries are a¤ected more strongly than their upstream suppliers.
In contrast, demand shocks (e.g., from imports or government spending) propagate upstream
— meaning that upstream suppliers of directly hit industries are a¤ected more strongly than
their downstream customers. This pattern results from the fact that supply-side shocks change
the prices faced by customer industries, creating powerful downstream propagation, while
demand-side shocks have much more minor (or no) e¤ects on prices and propagate upstream
as a¤ected industries adjust their production levels and thus input demands. In the simpli…ed
benchmark model studied in much of the literature, where both production functions and
consumer preferences are Cobb-Douglas (so that income and substitution e¤ects cancel out),
these e¤ects emerge particularly clearly: there is no upstream e¤ect from supply-side shocks
and no downstream e¤ect from demand-side shocks. In addition, we show that there is a
restriction on the quantitative magnitudes of the own e¤ect (measuring how a shock to an
industry a¤ects that industry) and the network e¤ects.
Our empirical work focuses on four di¤erent types of industry-level shocks, all propagating
through the input-output linkages at the level of 392 industries as measured by the Bureau
of Economic Analysis input-output tables. Our four shocks are: (1) variation from the exogenous component of imports from China; (2) changes in federal government spending (a¤ecting
industries di¤erentially on the basis of their dependence on demand from the federal govern2

Acemoglu, Akcigit and Kerr (2015) look at the medium-run spread of new ideas through the innovation
(knowledge-‡ow) network of the U.S. economy.

Though our evidence shows that microeconomic (industry-level) shocks are important and propagate
strongly, it does not directly speak to the issues discussed in the previous paragraph, that is, to whether a
law of large numbers-type argument will ensure that they wash out at the macro level.

ment); (3) total factor productivity (TFP) shocks; and (4) knowledge/productivity stimuli
coming from variation in foreign industry patents. For each one of these shocks, we construct
downstream and upstream network e¤ects by using information from the input-output tables
— namely by taking the inner product of the corresponding row or column of the input-output
matrix with a vector of shocks at the industry level. We then estimate parsimonious models of
industry-level value added, employment and productivity growth on their own lags, an industry’s own shocks, and downstream and upstream e¤ects from shocks hitting other industries.4
A brief summary of our results is as follows. For each one of these four shocks, we …nd
propagation through the input-output network to be statistically and economically important,
and broadly consistent with theory. In particular, for the two demand-side shocks — Chinese
imports and federal government spending — we …nd that upstream propagation is substantially stronger than downstream e¤ects, which are often zero or of opposite sign. In contrast,
for the two supply-side shocks — TFP and foreign patenting — there is strong downstream
propagation, and limited or no upstream e¤ects. In addition, the quantitative restrictions
between own e¤ects and network e¤ects implied by theory are often veri…ed. We also …nd the
general patterns to be quite robust to di¤erent weighting schemes, additional controls, longer
time scales, di¤erent lag structures, and so on.
The quantitative network e¤ects are sizable and typically larger than the quantitative
impact of own shocks. Figure 1a gives an indication of the magnitude of network e¤ects by
graphing the impulse response functions that result from a one-time one standard-deviation
shock to every manufacturing industry.5 The di¤erent panels show that network e¤ects are
more pronounced than own e¤ects. For example, one standard-deviation increase in imports
from China will have a direct (own) e¤ect of reducing value added growth by 3.46% in 10
years. Factoring in the (upstream) network e¤ects, the total impact of the same shock is a
22.1% decline in value added growth. This implies a sizable “network multiplier” (de…ned as
the size of the total impact relative to the direct impact of the shock) of 22:1=3:46 ' 6:4. The
implied employment multiplier is similar, approximately 5.9.

We …nally consider the e¤ect of geographic collocation (“overlay”) of industries. The geographic overlay of industries re‡ects the importance of localized networks, as industries with
4
We should add at this point that despite our use of the term “shocks,” we would like to be cautious in
claiming that our estimates correspond to causal e¤ects of purely exogenous shocks on endogenous economic
outcomes. Even though we specify our regression equations to guard against the most obvious forms of endogeneity (contemporaneous shocks a¤ecting both left- and right-hand side variables and Manski’s (1993) re‡ection
problem that would result from having grouped endogenous variables on the right-hand side), our shocks themselves may be endogenous to economic decisions in the recent past. For imports from China, because we are
focusing on the exogenous component of the variation, we are fairly con…dent that our estimates are informative
about causal e¤ects. The same applies, perhaps with some additional caveats, to federal spending shocks, since
we exploit variation across industries in their di¤erential responsiveness to such aggregate changes. For the TFP
and foreign patenting measures, the endogeneity concerns are more severe. Nevertheless, even in these cases we
believe that our regressions are informative about the propagation of these “pre-determined” shocks through
the input-output and geographic networks.

Here, consistent with theory, “network e¤ects” refer to downstream e¤ects for supply-side shocks and
upstream e¤ects for demand-side shocks. The details of how Figure 1 is constructed are provided below.

substantial exchanges frequently locate near each other to reduce transportation costs and
facilitate information transfer (e.g., Fujita, Krugman and Venables, 1999).6 After deriving a
theoretically-motivated measure of how industry-level shocks should propagate through the
geographic overlay of industries, we show that geographic e¤ects add another dimension of
network-based propagation. While our main results are robust to these additional controls for
geographic patterns, which demonstrates that input-output networks are operating above-andbeyond localized factors like regional business cycles, the geographic network also turns out
to be a powerful transmitter of shocks from one industry to others. In fact, even though our
estimates of the spread of shocks across collocating industries are slightly less robust than our
baseline results, the e¤ects appear quantitatively as large or even larger.
Overall, we interpret our results as suggesting that network-based propagation, particularly but not exclusively through the input-output linkages, might be playing a sizable role in
macroeconomic ‡uctuations, and certainly a more important one than typically presumed in
modern macroeconomics.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical model on inputoutput networks and shock propagation. Section 3 describes our data and provides descriptive
statistics. Section 4 presents our empirical results focusing exclusively on national input-output
connections, and Section 5 further adds in the geographic overlay. The last section concludes,
while Appendix A and Online Appendices B and C contain further results and omitted proofs.

Theory

In this section, we develop some simple theoretical implications of input-output linkages, and
then turn to a discussion of the macroeconomic consequences of the geographic concentration
of industries in certain areas.

2.1

Input-Output Linkages

We start with a model closely related to Long and Plosser (1983) and Acemoglu, Carvalho,
Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi (2012), which will clarify the role of input-output linkages.
Consider a static perfectly competitive economy with n industries, and suppose that each
industry i = 1; :::; n has a Cobb-Douglas production function of the form:
zi

yi = e li

l

Here xij is the quantity of goods produced by industry j used as inputs by industry i, li is
labor, and zi is a Hicks-neutral productivity shock (representing both technological and other

aij = 0 implies that the output of industry j is not used as an input for industry i), and

aij = 1;

j=1

so that the production function of each industry exhibits constant returns to scale.7
As equation (1) makes clear, the output of each industry is used as input for other industries
or consumed in the …nal good sector. Incorporating the demand from other industries, the
market-clearing condition for industry i can be written as
yi = ci +

n
X

xji + Gi ;

(2)

j=1

where ci is …nal consumption of the output of industry i, and Gi denotes government purchases
of good i, which are assumed to be wasted or spent on goods households do not directly care
about. We introduce government purchases to be able to model demand-side shocks in a simple
fashion.
The preference side of this economy is summarized by a representative household with a
utility function

ences (with the normalization ni=1 i = 1), and (l) is a decreasing (di¤erentiable) function

capturing the disutility of labor supply.

The government imposes a lump-sum tax, T , to …nance its purchases. Denoting the price
P
of the output of industry i by pi , this implies T = ni=1 pi Gi . Since its income comes only

from labor, wl, the representative household’s budget constraint can be written as

pi ci = wl

We focus on the competitive equilibrium of this static economy, which is de…ned in the
usual fashion, so that all …rms maximize pro…ts and the representative household maximizes

The main results we emphasize do not depend on the absence of physical capital, for example, with a
production function that takes the form

j=1

We suppress capital to simplify the notation and discussion.
More consequential is our assumption that this is a static economy where each industry simultaneously buys
inputs from others. Long and Plosser (1983), instead, assumed that an industry at time t uses as inputs
products produced by other industries at date t 1. We discuss the implications of our timing assumption and
the robustness of our results to this structure in Appendix C, available online.

in this competitive equilibrium. We also choose the wage as the numeraire (i.e., set w = 1).

where hij is the ij-th element of H (the Leontief inverse of A), and 1j=i is the indicator

no upstream e¤ ects (i.e., no e¤ ects on suppliers of a¤ ected industries) and only downstream

(i.e., sales from industry j to industry i normalized by sales of industry j). This

implies that demand-side shocks do not propagate downstream (i.e., to customers of a¤ ected
industries), only upstream (i.e., only to suppliers of a¤ ected industries).

6

This proposition is proved in Appendix A. Equations (6) and (7) form the basis of our
empirical strategy, and link the output of sector i to its own “shock,” dzi , and to “shocks”
hitting all other industries working through the input-output linkages of the economy. In
P
particular, in equation (6), dzi is the own shock, while nj=1 (hij 1j=i )dzj is the network
e¤ ect. Notice that this expression includes the propagation of the own shock through the
input-output linkages, hii

1, together with the network e¤ect, and then subtracts the own

e¤ect (via the indicator function 1j=i , which takes the value 1 when j = i and the value 0
~

otherwise), so as not to double count this direct e¤ect.8 Similarly, in equation (7), pdiGyii is the
P
^ ji 1j=i ) 1 dG
~ j is the network e¤ect.9 These equations have several
own shock and nj=1 (h

important implications.

First, what matters for the network e¤ects is not directly the entries of the input-output
^ but its Leontief inverse. The intuition is instructive about the workings of the
matrix, A or A,
model. For example, a negative productivity shock to industry j will reduce its production and
increase its price. This will adversely impact all of the industries that purchase inputs from
industry j. But this direct impact will be further augmented in the competitive equilibrium
because these …rst-round-a¤ected industries will change their production and prices, creating
indirect negative e¤ects on other customer industries (“downstream e¤ects”). The Leontief
inverse captures these indirect e¤ects
Second, the network e¤ects in response to the demand-side and supply-side shocks are
P
rather di¤erent. For supply-side shocks, the network e¤ect, nj=1 (hij 1j=i )dzj , implies that
the impact goes downstream (and not at all upstream). For demand-side shocks, the netP
^ ji 1j=i ) 1 dG
~ j , indicating upstream propagation
work e¤ect is given by the term nj=1 (h

Pn ^ 1

j=1 hji pj yj 1+
k=1 dGk , which re‡ects the impact of government spending on the represen-

tative household’s budget constraint — the government’s spending, …nanced by taxes, leaves
fewer resources for private consumption. The parameter

j

here captures the fact that the

impact of the lower net income of the representative household on the consumption of sector j
depends on the share of this sector in consumption, given by
no labor supply response and thus

j.

When

0

= 0 so that there is

= 0, this impact is maximized. On the other hand, when

there is a positive labor supply response, this e¤ect is partially o¤set by increased production
across the economy. It is also worth noting that these e¤ects are still propagated through the
^ ji terms, because a decline in the consumption of good
input-output matrix as shown by the h
j causes sector j to cut production and its input purchases from other sectors, leading to the
upstream transmission of the direct implications of the resource constraint.
The next two examples illustrate in greater detail why supply-side or productivity shocks

propagate downstream, while demand shocks propagate upstream.
Example 1 (Downstream propagation of supply-side shocks) Consider an economy
with three sectors, with the input-output network as shown in Panel A of Figure 2. Sector 1 is
the sole customer of sector 2, sector 2 is the sole customer of sector 3 and sector 3 is the sole
customer of sector 1. The sectoral production functions are therefore given as
l

l

l

y1 = ez1 l1 1 xa1212 ; y2 = ez2 l2 2 xa2323 ; and y3 = ez3 l3 3 xa3131 ;
and are all assumed to satisfy constant returns to scale. It follows from Proposition 1 that
sector 1’s output is:10
d ln y1 =

dz1 + a12 dz2 + a12 a23 dz3
:
1 a12 a23 a31

This expression shows that sector 1’s output depends on the shocks to all three sectors. However,
this is purely because of the propagation of productivity (supply-side) shocks downstream. For
example, sector 3’s productivity shock, z3 , a¤ ects y1 not because of upstream propagation, but
because of the chain of downstream propagation: sector 1 is a customer of sector 2, and sector 2
is a customer of sector 3. Indeed, the coe¢ cient of z3 in this expression, a12 a23 , illustrates this
indirect e¤ ect. To see further that there is no upstream propagation, consider a modi…cation
of this input-output network as shown in Panel B of Figure 2, where the link between sector 2
and sector 3 is severed (i.e., a23 = 0). The output of sector 1 then becomes
d ln y1 = dz1 + a12 dz2 ;
with no impact from z3 . This veri…es that it was the indirect downstream transmission of sector
3’s productivity shock that impacted sector 1. With the link between sectors 2 and 3 severed,
this indirect transmission ceases, and there is no longer any impact of z3 on sector 1. Had it
been the upstream propagation of productivity shocks, we would have seen a similar dependence
of sector 1’s output on z3 since the input linkage between these two sectors has not changed.
The intuition for why there are no economic e¤ects working upstream through the inputoutput network — as shown in Proposition 1 and Example 1 — is related to the Cobb-Douglas
nature of the production functions and preferences. Any impact on upstream industries will
depend on the balance of a quantity e¤ect (less is produced in industry j after an adverse
productivity shock) and price e¤ect (each unit produced in industry j is now more expensive).
With Cobb-Douglas technologies and preferences from households, these two e¤ects exactly
cancel out.11 Downstream propagation, on the other hand, is a consequence of the fact that an
10

Detailed derivations for this and the next example are provided in Appendix C, available online.
Clearly Cobb-Douglas is an approximation, though arguably not a bad one since the U.S. input-output
matrix appears to be fairly stable over time, as shown, for example, in Acemoglu et al. (2012) (and with nonCobb-Douglas technologies this would not be the case). Our empirical results also give additional credence to
the notion that Cobb-Douglas is a useful approximation for our purposes. In any case, it should be emphasized
11

adverse productivity shock to a sector leads to an increase in the price of that sector’s output,
encouraging its customer industries to use this input less intensively and thus reduce their own
production. This downstream propagation is also the reason why the impact of a shock depends
only on input-output linkages, and not on the consumption shares, the

j ’s.

The consumption

shares in‡uence the level of production in di¤erent sectors, but not the proportional responses
to productivity shocks; productivity shocks translate into proportional declines in prices and
thus proportional downstream transmission, regardless of consumption shares.
The next example illustrates the propagation of demand-side shocks.
Example 2 (Upstream propagation of demand-side shocks) Consider again the economy depicted in Panel A of Figure 2, but now with government spending shocks, expressed
~ 1 ; dG
~ 2 ; and dG
~ 3 , rather than productivity shocks (and thus setting
in nominal terms as dG
dz1 = dz2 = dz3 = 0). We also set

1

=

=

= 1=3. In this case, the change in the

nominal output of sector 1 (with tildes again denoting nominal variables) can be derived as

Once again, shocks to all three sectors in‡uence the nominal output of sector 1, but this time
it is because of the cumulative indirect e¤ ects working upstream. In particular, the e¤ ect of
~ 2 , on sector 1 is working upstream through its impact on sector 3 and
the shock to sector 2, dG
then sector 3’s impact on sector 1, as can be seen from the fact that this term is multiplied
by a23 a31 in the …rst line. The resource constraint e¤ ect is shown in the second line. Similar
to our analysis in the previous example, we can verify that the network e¤ ects shown in the
…rst line are not working through downstream propagation by considering Panel B of Figure 2.

where the second term is again the indirect e¤ ect working through the household budget constraint. The absence of an impact from the government spending shock to sector 2 now con…rms
that all propagation of demand-side shocks is upstream.
The intuition for why demand-side shocks propagate only upstream, as demonstrated in
Proposition 1 and Example 2, is also instructive. With government spending shocks, a¤ected
that the qualitative nature of the results emphasized in the proposition — that supply shocks will have larger
downstream e¤ects than upstream e¤ects — holds true with non-Cobb-Douglas technologies and preferences,
since even in this case quantity and price e¤ects would at least partially o¤set each other (and in fact, Acemoglu,
Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2015b, show that similar results to those in Proposition 1 can be obtained as …rstorder approximations under general production technologies).

industries have to increase their production to meet the increased demand from the government.
But given that they are using inputs from other supplier industries, this is only possible if
industries supplying inputs to them also expand their inputs (proportionately to the role of
these inputs in the production function of the a¤ected industries). This is the logic for upstream
propagation of demand-side shocks. Why is there no downstream propagation? Since all sectors
have constant returns to scale, prices in this economy are entirely independent of the demand
side. Government spending shocks change quantities but not prices (see Appendix A). But
this implies that the channel through which downstream propagation took place in response
to productivity shocks — changing relative prices — is entirely absent, accounting for the lack
of downstream propagation in response to demand-side shocks.
A third implication of equations (6) and (7) concerns the magnitudes of the coe¢ cients of
the own and network e¤ects. The simplest way of seeing this is to reorganize these equations
so that equation (6) becomes
d ln yi = hii

dzi +

X

hij

dzj ;

j6=i

which implies that if the indirect impacts of the own shock are included with the direct e¤ect
(and excluded from the network e¤ect), then the coe¢ cients of the own and the network e¤ects,
when properly scaled by the entries of the Leontief inverse, should be equal.12 The same is
true for the demand-side shocks in equation (7), which can be rearranged as

again showing the equality of the coe¢ cients of the properly scaled own and network e¤ects
(the …rst two terms). These results readily extend to the employment equation by observing
that the employment e¤ects are derived from the output e¤ects, and are thus proportional to
them.
Fourth, equations (6) and (7) also imply that what matters in our theoretical framework are
the contemporaneous shocks (e.g., dzi ), not some future anticipated shocks.13 This motivates
our use of current (or one-period lagged) shocks on the right-hand side of our estimating
equations.
Finally, we further note that the implications of import shocks are also very similar to
government spending shocks, since a decline in imports (without imposing trade balance) is
12

In fact, this equation implies that the coe¢ cients of the own and network e¤ects should both be equal to
one, though this prediction depends on the choice of units of the shocks, the dz’s. In practice, the coe¢ cients
will be di¤erent than one but still equal to each other depending on the speci…c choices of units for measuring
our shocks.
13
This can be seen straightforwardly by considering a dynamic version of the model (without additional
intertemporal linkages), in which case equations (6) and (7) would apply with time subscripts, with only dzit
being relevant for time t outcomes. In the presence of irreversible investments and/or other intertemporal
linkages at the sectoral level, expectations of future shocks would also matter.

10

analogous to an increase in government spending on the same sectors, and for this reason, we
have not separately introduced these shocks in our theoretical model.

2.2

The E¤ects of the Geographic Network

Another important set of interlinkages, which could be represented as network e¤ects, relates
to geographic overlay over industries (corresponding to how industries collocate in various
local labor markets, for example as measured by commuting zones). Thinking through these
geographic interactions is important to ensure that our empirical work can distinguish inputoutput network e¤ects from these geographic interlinkages; moreover, these local linkages are
also of direct interest as another transmitter of industry-level shocks.
Let us start with a simple reduced-form model capturing local demand e¤ects
d ln yr;i =

X yr;j
yr

j6=i

d ln yr;j + dzi ;

(8)

where yr;i is the output of industry i in region r, and dzi is an industry shock normalized to
have a unit impact on the industry’s output (in a region). In what follows, take

to be small

(and in particular less than 1).
This equation captures the idea that if industries in a given region (local labor market)
are hit by negative shocks, this will reduce economic activity and adversely a¤ect output and
employment in other industries, which is consistent with empirical evidence reported in Autor,
Dorn and Hanson (2013) and Mian and Su… (2015). For example, if a large employer in a given
local labor market shuts down, this will reduce the demand and thus employment and output
of other local employers. The most obvious channel for this is through some local demand
e¤ects, though other local linkages would also lead to a relationship similar to (8).
The functional form in this equation is intuitive and implies that the impact of a proportional decline in industry j on industry i in the same region will be scaled by the importance
of industry j in the region’s output (yr;j =yr ). Note also that, for simplicity’s sake, we ignore
the network e¤ects coming from input-output linkages in this subsection.
The next step is to solve the within-region equilibrium implied by (8). Doing this with
matrix algebra, we can write
d ln yr;i = (I

Given our analysis of input-output models, it is not surprising that a Leontief inverse type
matrix is playing a central role here. But in this instance, it is useful for us to go beyond
11

this matrix representation. In particular, when
higher-order terms in
the following

is small as we have assumed, second- and

can be ignored, and the within-region equilibrium can be expressed in

form:14
d ln yr;i

dzi +

X yr;j
j6=i

yr

dzj :

Intuitively, this equation describes the within-region equilibrium as a function of shocks to all
industries (solving out all “endogenous” terms from the right-hand side). Now using the fact
that d ln yr;i = dyr;i =yr;i , and summing across regions, we obtain
dyi =

X

dyr;i

X X yr;i yr;j

yi dzi +

r

j6=i

which then enables us to obtain a simple representation of the geographic e¤ects:
d ln yi

X

dzi +

geographic_overlayi;j dzj ;

(10)

j6=i

where

X yr;i yr;j

geographic_overlayi;j

r

yi yr

is the non-centered cross-region correlation coe¢ cient of industries i and j, normalized by their
national levels of production, and represents their tendency to collocate.
Intuitively, this equation captures the fact that industries will be impacted not only by
their direct shocks but also by the shocks of other industries that tend to collocate with them.
For example, if coal and steel industries are always in the same few regions, the steel industry
will be negatively a¤ected nationally not only when there is a negative shock to itself but
also when there is a negative shock to the coal industry, because when the coal industry is
producing less in the region, other industries in that region are also adversely a¤ected, and
steel is overrepresented among these industries that happen to be in the same region as coal.
Though the term we have for geographic overlay is simple and intuitive, it is based on
an approximation that involves ignoring all terms that are second or higher order in , thus
posing the natural question of whether including some of these additional terms would lead
to additional insights. To provide a partial answer to this question, we now include secondorder terms (thus ignoring only third- or higher-order terms in ), which leads to a natural
generalization of (10). In particular, the within-region equilibrium can now be expressed as
d ln yr;i

Data and Descriptive Statistics

This section describes our various data sources and the construction of the key measures of
downstream and upstream e¤ects and the geographic network.

3.1

Data Sources

Our core industry-level data for manufacturing come from the NBER-CES Manufacturing
Industry Database (Becker, Grey and Marvakov, 2013). We utilize data for the years 19912009. Using the …rst change as a baseline, our estimations cover 17 changes from 1992-1993
to 2008-2009. In the …rst four changes, we have 392 four-digit industries; thereafter, we have
384 industries for 6560 total observations. Though the theoretical predictions derived in the
previous section are in terms of total industry output (shipments), our baseline analysis focuses
on (real) value added due to its adjustment for energy costs, non-manufacturing inputs, and
inventory changes which are all outside of our model. We show similar results using real and
nominal shipments in Appendix B, available online.
To construct our linkages between industries, we use the Bureau of Economic Analysis’1992
Input-Output Matrix and the 1991 County Business Patterns database as described further
below. In the next section, we describe the data used for each shock when introducing it.

3.2

Upstream and Downstream Networks

The construction of downstream and upstream e¤ects follows Acemoglu et al. (2015). We
construct the matrix A introduced in Section 2 from the 1992 “Make” and “Use” Tables of
the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This matrix has input share entries corresponding to
aij

Salesj!i
:
Salesi

As emphasized in Section 2, this quantity measures the total sales of inputs from industry
j to industry i, normalized by the total sales (or equivalently the total costs) of industry i.
Intuitively, it corresponds to how many dollars worth of the output of sector j (say tires) sector
i (say the car industry) needs to purchase to produce one dollar worth of its own output. When
production functions are Cobb-Douglas, as we have assumed in our theoretical analysis, these
13

input shares are constant regardless of prices. Equation (6) shows that network e¤ects from
supply-side shocks directly depend on these input shares. The Leontief inverse of the inputoutput matrix is then computed from the matrix of these input-output shares as (I

A)

1

to give our downstream network measure. In what follows, we use the notation Input%j!i to
represent the elements of the Leontief inverse of the input-output matrix.15
For constructing the network e¤ects from demand-side shocks, we again follow equation
(7), which decomposes the response of a sector into an own e¤ect, a network e¤ect and the
resource constraint e¤ect. We …rst ignore the last one and focus on the network e¤ect. The
^ ji (or a
presence of the h
^ji ) terms in this equation underscores the di¤erent aspects of inputoutput linkages involved in upstream propagation. The empirical counterparts of the a
^ij terms
are

Salesi!j
Salesi

aji

Salesj
;
Salesi

which we use to compute the upstream network measures. We use Output%i!j to represent
these Leontief inverse terms. We return to the resource constraint e¤ect later.

3.3

Geographic Overlay

We also measure the geographic overlay of two industries using the metric developed in the
theory section,
geographic_overlayi;j

X yr;i yr;j
r

yi yr

:

We de…ne regions through BEA commuting zones and utilize 1991 County Business Patterns
data to measure the overlay. We also calculate the higher-order geographic overlay term (11).
In practice, however, we observe very little additional explanatory power with the second
metric and thus focus simply on the direct collocation case.

3.4

Correlation Matrices

Table 1a shows the correlation matrix of these interconnections, excluding own-industry interconnections (i.e., network diagonals). Upstream and downstream material ‡ows are moderately
correlated at 0.4 and somewhat less strongly correlated with geographic overlay, indicating that
input-output linkages operate, for the most part, beyond common geographies.
Table 1b depicts the correlation of our four measures of shocks with each other, and shows
that our di¤erent shocks are only weakly correlated, assuaging concerns that we may be tracing
the e¤ects of omitted shocks when modeling the e¤ect of each shock one at the time. Column 5 of Table 1b reports the average between-industry correlation for each shock (e.g., how
correlated is, say, the federal spending shock of an industry with the federal spending shocks
of other industries). This is relevant in part because a high between-industry correlation of
15

We use this notation rather than hij as in Section 2 to emphasize that these are the empirical counterparts
of the theoretical notions developed above.

14

shocks might create spurious network e¤ects in the presence of an omitted higher-order impact of own shocks. The relatively low between-industry correlations, except for the federal
spending shock, are comforting in this regard. The higher between-industry correlation for the
federal spending shock is unsurprising since it is constructed from the interaction of aggregate
time-series variation in federal spending with a time-invariant measure of federal spending
dependency of each industry (as detailed further below).

Results: The Input-Output Network

This section provides our primary empirical results that quantify shock propagation through
the input-output networks, leaving the analysis of the geographic network to the next section.
We focus on four shocks: (1) import penetration; (2) federal spending changes; (3) TFP growth;
and (4) foreign patenting growth. The …rst two correspond to demand-side shocks, while the
latter two are supply-side, approximating productivity shocks. We …rst consider each shock by
itself, describing how we measure it, and studying its empirical properties in isolation. After
cycling through all four shocks independently, we jointly model them and provide an extended
discussion of economic magnitudes.

4.1

Empirical Approach

Throughout, our main estimating equations are direct analogs of equations (6) and (7) in the
theory section, and take the following form:
ln Yi;t =

where i indexes industries,

+ "i;t ;

denotes a full set of time e¤ects, "i;t is an error term, and Yi;t

stands for one of three industry-level variables from the NBER manufacturing database: real
value added (using the industry’s shipments de‡ator), employment, and real labor productivity
(real value added divided by employment).
In our baseline results, time periods correspond to years. We start with a model that only
considers the core regressors outlined in equation (12), and then we show robustness checks
that add extra controls. We allow only a single lag of the dependent variable on the right-hand
side for parsimony. The role of additional lags is taken up in robustness checks.
The key regressors are Shocki;t

1,

the industry’s own direct shock (taken from one of

the four shocks introduced above), and U pstreami;t

1

and Downstreami;t

1

which stand for

the shocks working through the network. These network shocks are always computed from
the interaction of the vector of shocks hitting other industries and a vector representing the
interlinkages between the focal industry and the rest (e.g., the row or the column of the inputoutput matrix); we provide exact details below.
15

The upstream and downstream terminology in network analyses has some ambiguity. In
the remainder, we follow our usage in Section 2 and label “upstream e¤ects” as those arising
from shocks to customers of an industry that ‡ow up the input-output chain; in parallel, we
describe “downstream e¤ects”as those arising from shocks to suppliers of an industry that ‡ow
down the input-output chain. Henceforth, for clarity, we use “upstream” and “downstream”
terms to describe exclusively the e¤ects. When there is a need to describe where the shock
originates, we will use the terms “customer” and “supplier” to avoid confusion.
Thus, we measure downstream e¤ects (due to supplier shocks) and upstream e¤ects (due
to customer shocks) closely mimicking the theoretical equations, (6) and (7). In particular,
these are given by the weighted averages of shocks hitting all industries using entries of the
Leontief inverse matrices as weights:
Downstreami;t =
and
U pstreami;t =

X

X

j

j

(Input%1991
j!i

(Output%1991
i!j

1j=i ) Shockj;t ;

(13)

1j=i ) Shockj;t ;

(14)

where 1j=i is an indicator function for j = i, and the summation is over all industries, including
industry i itself. Thus as in the equations (6) and (7), when computing the downstream e¤ect
for sector i, we take into account the indirect linkages from this industry to itself (e.g., the fact
that industry i supplies to industry j, which is also a supplier to i), but we subtract the direct
e¤ect of the shock, since in our regressions we will directly control for the shock to sector i.
Several other points are worth noting. First, as already observed, input-output linkages
(and thus the Leontief inverse entries) are pre-determined and measured in 1991. Thus, downstream and upstream e¤ects are simply a function of shocks in connected industries working
through a pre-determined input-output network.
Second, we lag both own and network shocks by one period, simply to avoid any concern
about contemporaneous measurement issues from our dependent variables to shocks (e.g.,
in the case of TFP) and about contemporaneous joint determination. It should be stressed,
however, that we do not claim that this timing will enable us to estimate causal e¤ects. Rather,
we rely on the plausible exogeneity of shocks, especially for imports from China and federal
government spending, and caution that this exogeneity is likely to be absent in the case of the
TFP and foreign patenting shocks.
Third, equation (12) is formulated in changes, and shocks are always speci…ed in changes
as detailed below. The speci…cation could have alternatively been written in levels together
with an industry …xed e¤ect. The advantage of the current formulation is that it both follows
more directly from and connects to our theoretical model, and imposes that the error term is
stationary in di¤erences, which is generally a better description of macro time series.
Finally, in what follows, unless otherwise stated, we standardize the Shocki;t

1

variable so

that a unit increase corresponds to a one standard-deviation change in the positive direction
16

(e.g., decrease in imports or increase in TFP), and the U pstreami;t

and Downstreami;t

1

variables are constructed in the same units. This implies that the coe¢ cient on the Shocki;t

1

1

variable will measure the impact of a one standard-deviation increase in the industry’s own
shock, whereas the coe¢ cients on U pstreami;t

1

and Downstreami;t

1

will measure the impact

of a one standard-deviation increase in the shock of all customers and suppliers of an industry.
Moreover, all of these coe¢ cients are directly comparable and are expected to be positive where
theory predicts a network-based e¤ect.

4.2

China Import Shocks

Our …rst shock relates to the growth of imports from China and follows Autor et al. (2013)
and Acemoglu et al. (2015). Acemoglu et al. (2015) show this pattern for decade-long
adjustments, and we extend this analysis to shorter frequencies considered in macroeconomics.
As highlighted in Section 2, this demand-side shock should have greater upstream e¤ects than
downstream e¤ects, and in the case of Cobb-Douglas, downstream e¤ects should not be present
at all.
We …rst de…ne ChinaT rade to capture this industry exposure to rising Chinese trade,
ChinaT radej;t =

U.S. Imports from Chinaj;t
:
U.S. market sizej;1991

This variable, however, is clearly endogenous, as it will tend to be higher when the industry
in question has lower productivity growth for other reasons, creating greater room for a rise
in imports, and is thus not a good measure of shocks for our analysis. To deal with this
endogeneity concern, we follow Autor et al. (2013) and Acemoglu et al. (2015) and instrument
this variable with its exogenous component, de…ned as the change in import penetration from
China to eight major non-U.S. countries relative to 1991 U.S. market volume, with the nations
being Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland:
Non-U.S. Imports from Chinaj;t
:
U.S. market sizej;1991

ChinaT radeIV
j;t =

This instrument has the advantage of not being directly a¤ected by changes in productivity or
demand in the U.S. economy.16
The downstream and upstream e¤ects are calculated from (13) and (14) adapted to this
case. For example, for the downstream e¤ects coming from supplier industries, we model the
shock:
DownstreamTi;trade =

X

j

(Input%1991
j!i

1j=i )

ChinaT radej;t :

(15)

16
First-stage equations naturally also control for all other covariates from the second stage, including the
lagged dependent variable, to ensure consistent estimation. But of course, the only excluded instrument is the
exogenous component of the change in import penetration.

17

We also construct the network instruments using the same reasoning as in (13) and (14). For
example, for the downstream e¤ects this simply takes the form of
DownstreamTi;tradeIV =

X

j

(Input%1991
j!i

1j=i )

ChinaT radeIV
j;t :

In summary, we have three endogenous variables, ChinaT radej;t , DownstreamTi;trade
T radeIV and
and U pstreamTi;trade , and three instruments, ChinaT radeIV
j;t , Downstreami;t

U pstreamTi;tradeIV . The …rst stages for these three variables are shown in Appendix Table
1 (all appendix tables are included in Appendix B).
Table 2a presents our estimates of own and network e¤ects from this exercise, using a table
format which we replicate for each subsequent shock. Table 2a presents our baseline results
for the three outcome variables, considering one and three lags for the dependent variable, and
shows strong upstream e¤ects on supplier industries (similar to Acemoglu et al. 2015).
More speci…cally, recall that we have standardized (in terms of standard-deviation units)
and normalized all of our shocks to be positive, so that an increase in imports from China
corresponds to a negative value of the shocks, and thus positive coe¢ cients imply that rising
imports from China reduce value added and employment in the a¤ected industries. In this light,
the results in Column 1 indicate that a one standard-deviation own-industry shock reduces the
focal industry’s value added growth by 3.4%.17 More interestingly given our focus, they also
indicate that a similar one standard-deviation change in customers of an industry leads to
a 7.6% decline in value added growth through upstream e¤ects. Downstream e¤ects are of
opposite sign and statistically insigni…cant, though they are sometimes quantitatively sizable.
Lack of (same-signed) signi…cant downstream e¤ects in response to demand-side shocks is
consistent with our main theoretical implications outlined in Section 2. Finally, the bottom
row of the table tests the other implication from the theory highlighted in Proposition 1,
that the relevant diagonal entry from the Leontief inverse matrix (i.e., the coe¢ cient on hii
ChinaT radei;t

1)

should be equal to the upstream e¤ect from other industries. For value

added, this restriction is marginally rejected at 10%, though it is not rejected in any of the
other columns.18
Column 2 shows that the overall pattern is similar when two more lags of the dependent
variable are included on the right-hand side, even though these lags show some evidence of
additional persistence. In particular, the quantitative implications are very similar, and it is
again the upstream e¤ects that are signi…cant while the downstream ones are not.
Our regression speci…cations follow directly from Proposition 1 (for example, in the case of
17

The unweighted standard deviation in industry growth rates for our sample is 0.15 for log value added
growth and 0.10 for log employment growth.
18
This restriction is not tested directly from the reported regression, but from the related regression described
in Section 2, following Proposition 1, where own e¤ects re‡ect the diagonal elements of the Leontief inverse
matrix. We report speci…cations in which the own e¤ects are not scaled in this manner to maintain transparency
about the direct …rst-order e¤ects of own-industry shocks. In any case, the coe¢ cient estimates when we
undertake this scaling are similar to those reported in the tables in the paper.

18

the China import shocks, equation (7)). The coe¢ cient estimates in these regression equations
do not directly translate into quantitative e¤ects for “multipliers,” however. This is because
the upstream e¤ect (the relevant dimension of the network e¤ects in this case) corresponds to
the impact of the shock of all other industries, weighted by their upstream linkages, on the
focal industry. Instead, to obtain an economically meaningful multiplier, measuring how large
the total impact of a shock is relative to its direct e¤ect, we need to measure its impact on all
other industries. To achieve this, we convert upstream and downstream e¤ects into a weighted
average of shocks in other industries using the Leontief inverse elements of weights.19 We use
these adjusted estimates to construct the impulse response functions depicted in Figure 1a
and for computing the relevant multipliers. Panel A of Figure 1a depicts the impulse response
of value added to a one standard-deviation Chinese import shock obtained from this exercise
(with a speci…cation corresponding to Column 2 of Table 2a). These impulse responses show
that the quantitative magnitude of the network e¤ects (in this case, upstream e¤ects, since we
are focusing on demand-side shocks) are considerably larger than the direct e¤ect: the direct
e¤ect (from the own shock) after ten periods is a 3.46% increase in value added growth, while
the total impact is a 22.09% (3:46 + 18:64) increase in value added. This yields a multiplier of
6.4 (' 22:09=3:46), and implies that input-output linkages more than double the direct e¤ects
of demand-side shocks. It can be seen from the …gure that the implied multipliers are very
similar at di¤erent horizons.
Columns 3 and 4 turn to employment. The overall pattern and even the quantitative
magnitudes are very similar, with clear upstream e¤ects and no downstream e¤ects, and the
theory-implied restrictions receive support from our estimates. Panel A of Figure 1b depicts
the impulse response of employment to the same shock as in Figure 1a. The implied multiplier
in this case (for employment changes) is 5.86.
Columns 5 and 6 turn to labor productivity. Here we …nd no robust patterns, which is
not surprising since Columns 1-4 document that the numerator and denominator move in the
same direction and by similar amounts.
Table 2b reports multiple robustness checks. Our results are very similar without the own19

More speci…cally, focusing on upstream e¤ects, recall that U pstreami;t =

so that it corresponds to a weighted average of shocks hitting industries.
The simplest andX

is to divide our coe¢ cient estimates by

of industries). The adjustment for the downstream e¤ect is very similar. From the U.S. input-output matrix,
this adjustment factor is 2:156.
An alternative method would be to rerun all of our speci…cations using the adjusted upstream and downstream measures (computed as weighted averages as indicated above). This method yields estimates of network
multipliers for value added and employment of 5.9 and 8.0, respectively, which are comparable to the 6.4 and
5.9 multipliers estimated by the direct adjustment method outlined here and reported below.

shock term. Our baseline estimates are unweighted, and we obtain similar results when we
weight observations by log 1991 value added or by 1991 employment levels. We also consider a
series of more demanding speci…cations where we include a full set of two-, three- and four-digit
SIC dummies. Since our speci…cation in equation (12) is in changes, this amounts to including
linear time trends for these industry groupings. The results are generally robust, although
the downstream e¤ects do move around and sometimes become larger, even if still far from
signi…cance.
The …nal column of Table 2b returns to the resource constraint e¤ect identi…ed in Proposition 1. As noted above, our baseline speci…cations focusing on demand-side shocks have
ignored this resource constraint e¤ect, corresponding to the third term in equation (7). To the
extent that this term is correlated with our network e¤ect, it may lead to biased estimates.
We compute the empirical equivalent of this third term following equation (7) closely. We sum
P
~ k , multiply it with an
nominal manufacturing imports from China to obtain the term n dG
k=1

estimate of

j , computed as the value added share of industry j, divide it by pj yj , and then

multiply it with the corresponding entries of the Leontief inverse of the upstream linkages to

~
in the denominator). We then add
obtain nj=1 h
k=1 dGk (ignoring the term 1 +
pj yj j
this term as an additional regressor instrumented by an additional instrument computed in the

same way from Chinese imports by the same eight non-U.S. advanced economies. The …nal
column of Table 2b shows that this speci…cation leads to somewhat larger network e¤ects, but
the overall picture remains unchanged.
Appendix Table 2a repeats this analysis with log real shipments growth as the outcome
variable, and also shows similar results.
An additional issue is that the presence of the lagged dependent variable on the right-hand
side of our estimating equation, (12), introduces the possibility of biased estimates when the
time dimension is short due to the challenges of obtaining consistent estimates of the persistence
parameter,

, with short panels as noted by Nickell (1981). We further investigate this issue

in Appendix Table 2b. In particular, our main concern here is with the network e¤ects, which
may inherit the bias of the parameter

in short panels. One way of ensuring that this bias

is not responsible for our results is to impose di¤erent values for the parameter

and verify

that this has no or little impact on our results (see Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson,
2014). Appendix Table 2b performs this exercise for the China trade shock and documents
that both own and upstream e¤ects are highly signi…cant and similar to our baseline estimates
for any value of

between our estimate of this parameter in Table 2a (

= 0) and the full

unit root limit ( = 1), becoming only a little weaker at the full unit root case of
downstream e¤ects remain insigni…cant except marginally at

= 1 (while

= 1).

Appendix Table 2c considers longer time periods, thus linking our results more closely to
Acemoglu et al. (2015), who focused on a decadal panel. For two-year periods, we prepare
nine time periods from 1991

1993 to 2007 2009: For three-year periods, we consider six time

20

periods from 1991

1994 to 2006

2009: For four-year periods, we consider four time periods

from 1991 1995 to 2003 2007: For …ve-year periods, we consider 1991 1996; 1996 2001; and
2001

2006. In each case, the …rst period is used to create the network lags. The downstream

customer e¤ects and own-industry e¤ects tend to grow with longer time periods.
In addition to these robustness checks, Appendix Table 6 shows very similar outcomes when
we consider nominal value added and shipments growth instead of our baseline real value added
growth and the real shipments shown in Appendix Table 2a. Appendix Table 7 also reports
results where we vary the number of lags included for own-industry shocks and network shocks.
We report in the table the sums of the coe¢ cients across the deeper lags and their statistical
signi…cance. These variants yield quite similar conclusions to our reported estimations.

4.3

Federal Spending Shocks

The next analysis considers changes in U.S. federal government spending levels, which are anticipated to operate similar to trade shocks by a¤ecting industries through heightened demand
from industrial customers. We …rst calculate from the 1992 BEA Input-Output Matrix the
share of sales for each industry that went to the federal government,
F edSales%i =

Salesi!F ed
:
Salesi

This share ranges from zero dependency for about 10% of industries to over 50% for the top
percentile of industries in terms of dependency. Some prominent examples and their share
of sales include 3731 Ship Building and Repairing (76%), 3761 Guided Missiles and Space
Vehicles (74%), 3482 Small Arms Ammunition (65%), and 3812 Search, Detection, Navigation,
Guidance, Aeronautical and Nautical Systems and Instruments (51%).
We interact this measure with the log change in federal government expenditures,
F ederalShocki;t = F edSales%1991
i

ln F ederalSpendingt

1;

holding …xed the industry dependency at its 1991 level. Intuitively, the speci…cation anticipates
greater “shocks” from aggregate federal budget changes for industries that have larger initial
shares of sales to the federal government. The change in federal spending is lagged one year
to re‡ect the fact that procurement frequently extends into the following year. Once again
following (13) and (14), the downstream e¤ects in this case are de…ned as
X
DownstreamFi;tederal =
(Input%1991
1j=i ) F ederalShockj;t :
j!i
j

A similar approach is taken for the other network metrics.

Because this variable focuses on federal spending changes in the aggregate (driven by,
among other things, swings in political moods, ideology, identity of the government, wars and
budget exigencies), and is then constructed with the interaction of these aggregate changes
with the time-invariant and pre-determined dependency of each industry on federal spending,
21

we believe that it can be taken as plausibly exogenous to the contemporaneous productivity
or supply-side shocks hitting the focal industry.
The structure of Table 3a is identical to those examining trade shocks. The results are also
similar. For example, in Table 3a, upstream e¤ects are again signi…cant and quantitatively
sizable (about three to …ve times as large as own e¤ects). Downstream e¤ects are now of the
same sign as the upstream e¤ect, but continue to be statistically insigni…cant. The theoryimplied restriction reported in the bottom row is again broadly supported (it is never rejected
at 5%). In addition, the own e¤ect is insigni…cant when we only control for one lag of the
dependent variable, but signi…cant both in Columns 2 and 4 when we control for three lags.
Table 3b and Appendix Tables 3a-3c, 6 and 7 perform the same robustness checks as
those discussed for trade shocks and show that the above-mentioned patterns are generally
quite robust. All in all, the propagation of this very di¤erent demand-side shock appears
remarkably similar to the propagation of the import shocks, and in both cases in line with the
theory we have used to motivate our approach.
The economic magnitudes are once more far from trivial. Panel B of Figures 1a and 1b
depict the impulse response functions for own and upstream e¤ects computed in the same way
as for Panel A, and indicate that there are once again sizable network e¤ects. The implied
network multipliers for value added and employment at the 10-year horizon are 6.42 and 5.00,
respectively.

4.4

TFP Shocks

We next turn to supply-side shocks, starting with TFP. Baseline TFP shocks for manufacturing industries are the lagged change in four-factor TFP taken from the NBER Productivity
Database. Importantly, these TFP measures control for materials, and thus should not be
mechanically a function of downstream e¤ects (changes in prices and quantities in industries
supplying inputs to the focal industry).
Similar to our other network-based measures, these are constructed by aggregating these
industry-level log components of TFP in connected industries. Continuing our illustration
using downstream e¤ects from shocks to supplier industries and again following on (13) and
(14), we model
DownstreamTi;tF P =

X

j

(Input%1991
j!i

1j=i )

ln T F Pj;t :

We should caution that the case for the exogeneity of the TFP shocks is weaker, because
past TFP may be endogenous to other shocks (e.g., to capacity utilization or labor hoarding)
which have a persistent impact on value added and factor demands. With this caveat, we still
believe that predetermined TFP shocks are informative about how supply-side shocks spread
through the input-output network.
The structure of Table 4a is identical to those examining trade and federal spending shocks.
Consistent with theory, it is now downstream e¤ects that are more sizable and important,
22

though in this case there are some statistically signi…cant estimates of upstream e¤ects as well.
For example, in Column 1 of Table 4a, downstream e¤ects are estimated to have a coe¢ cient
of 0.060 (standard error = 0.020), while upstream e¤ects come in at 0.024 (standard error =
0.011). Interestingly, own e¤ects are small and imprecise for value added, but more precisely
estimated (though still about half of the upstream e¤ects) for employment. The theoretical
restriction tested in the bottom row is now rejected for value added, where the own e¤ects are
small, but is in closer alignment for employment. The robustness checks reported in Appendix
B con…rm this overall pattern.20
Economic magnitudes can again be gleaned from Panel C of Figures 1a and 1b; the implied
multipliers are 15.56 and 4.43 for value added growth and employment growth over ten years,
respectively. The larger multiplier for value added in this case re‡ects the smaller direct (own)
impact.

4.5

Foreign Patenting Shocks

Our …nal shock represents changes in patented technology frontiers. Since this shock also
captures supply-side changes in productivity, responses to it should be similar to those to TFP
shocks.
Baseline patent shocks for manufacturing industries in Table 5a are the lagged log change in
USPTO granted patents …led by overseas inventors associated with the industry. We measure
foreign patent shocks using USPTO granted patents through 2009. We develop a new concordance of patent classes to four-digit manufacturing industries that extends the earlier work
of Silverman (1999), Johnson (1999), and Kerr (2008). Continuing our downstream e¤ects
example, we have
DownstreamFi;toreignP atent =

X

j

(Input%1991
j!i

1j=i )

ln P atentsFj;toreign :

These foreign patents quantify technology changes in the world technology frontier external
to the U.S. economy (e.g., patents …led by car manufacturers in Germany and Japan signal
advances in automobile technologies that have not originated in the United States). There
are two additional di¢ culties in this case, however. First, foreign patenting may be correlated
with past technological improvements in the U.S. sectors, which might have persistent e¤ects.
Second, improved technology abroad may directly impact U.S. …rms through …ercer product
market competition, not just through technology and productivity spillovers (e.g., Bloom,
Shankerman and Van Reenen, 2013).21 These concerns make us more cautious in interpreting
the foreign patenting shocks, especially for own e¤ects, though we believe that this analysis is
still informative about network-based propagation.
20

However, in this case, Appendix Table 4b shows that the results are sensitive to the exact value of the
persistence parameter, .
21
Bloom et al. (2013) develop a strategy for controlling for this competition e¤ect, but the implementation
of their strategy is not feasible given our industry-level data.

23

Table 5a shows strong downstream e¤ects with again no evidence of sizable upstream effects. The theory-implied restrictions in the bottom row of the table are typically rejected,
re‡ecting the very small and sometimes incorrectly-signed estimates of own e¤ects. One possible explanation for this pattern of own e¤ects is that, as already noted, an increase in foreign
patents in one’s own industry likely signals …ercer competition from international competitors.
The network e¤ects, which should be less impacted by these considerations, are again quite
similar to our theory’s predictions.
Panel D of Figures 1a and 1b again depict the impulse responses of value added and employment. We do not compute multipliers in this case, since the own e¤ects are imprecisely
estimated and potentially biased for the reasons explained above, thus making multiplier estimates harder to interpret.

4.6

VAR Analysis

Our empirical speci…cation, (12), directly builds on our theoretical model (in particular, equations (6) and (7)), and expresses the endogenous response of value added and employment to
shocks hitting all industries. An alternative is to follow vector auto regression (VAR) models
and express endogenous variables as a function of own shocks and the values of the endogenous
variables of linked industries. The analog of equation (12) in this case would be

which only features the shock hitting sector i, and models upstream and downstream effects from the changes in value added of linked industries — the terms

U pstream
ln Yi;t
and
1

Downstream . This equation could also be derived from our theoretical framework. Relaln Yi;t
1

tive to our baseline empirical model, (12), this speci…cation faces two related problems. First,
the terms

U pstream
ln Yi;t
and
1

Downstream generate a version of Manski’s well-known reln Yi;t
1

‡ection problem (Manski, 1993), as outcome variables of one industry are being regressed on
the contemporaneous (or one-period lagged) outcomes of other industries, creating the possibility of spurious correlation. Second, these terms are also more likely to be correlated with
each other, potentially leading to multicollinearity, which will make distinguishing these various
e¤ects more di¢ cult.
These problems notwithstanding, we now estimate equation (16) to show that the results from this complementary approach are broadly similar. To avoid the most severe form
of the re‡ection problem, throughout we instrument for the upstream and downstream effects,

U pstream
ln Yi;t
and
1

Downstream , using the …rst and second lags of each shock as
ln Yi;t
1

experienced in the network (i.e., our instruments are the core regressors in equation (12),
U pstreami;t

1

and Downstreami;t

1 ).

We report two speci…cations per shock. In the …rst,

we model and instrument the focal part of the network relevant for each shock (e.g., upstream
24

e¤ects for supply-side shocks and downstream e¤ects for demand-side shocks). In the second
speci…cation, we include and instrument for both upstream and downstream e¤ects. Also, in
the case of China trade shocks, we continue to instrument for the own shock, Shocki;t

1

as

well.
The results of this exercise are reported in Table 6 and are quite consistent with our baseline
…ndings. Even though this empirical speci…cation is more demanding for the reasons explained
above, the speci…cations focusing on China trade and TFP shocks give similar results, and
speci…cations using federal spending shocks also lead to similar results for value added, though
not for employment. Foreign patenting results do not hold with this approach, however.22

4.7

Combined Shock Analysis

Table 7 estimates own, upstream and downstream e¤ects simultaneously from several of the
shocks so far analyzed in isolation. This is relevant for two related reasons. First, we would like
to verify that our downstream and upstream e¤ects indeed capture network-based propagation
of di¤erent types of shocks rather than some other omitted characteristics, and attempting to
simultaneously estimate these e¤ects provides some information on this concern. Second, it
is important to quantify whether the simultaneous operation of all of these networked e¤ects
creates attenuation, which is relevant for our quantitative evaluation.
Table 7 shows the estimates of upstream and downstream e¤ects in this joint analysis are
remarkably similar to our previous results. Appendix Table 8 also shows this similarity when
we exclude the foreign patenting shocks due to the concerns about own e¤ects discussed above.
These results bolster our con…dence in the patterns documented so far and also suggest that
the quantitative magnitudes of the propagation through these input-output networks is larger
when we consider all four shocks simultaneously.
To quantify impacts from this joint exercise, we now consider one standard-deviation
changes of the three shocks, imports from China, federal spending and TFP, simultaneously.
The impulse response functions from this exercise are shown in Figure 2 in Appendix B, and
the combined multipliers for value added and employment growth in Panels A and B are 11.47
and 8.23, respectively. Thus, the network elements jointly continue to account for more ‡uctuation than direct components. The lower panels show similar results when including foreign
patenting shocks.
22
Appendix Figure 1 reports impulse response functions akin to Figures 1a and 1b using the results from
Table 6, where we trace out a one-standard deviation upstream or downstream network component in terms of
value added or employment, as instrumented by each shock, alongside the direct e¤ect of the shock. For brevity,
we only plot the stable and theory-consistent estimates, which are the ones that are meaningful to compare
to our baseline results. The resulting magnitudes are comparable to, though somewhat larger than, our main
estimates.

25

4.8

Monte Carlo Veri…cation

Though our empirical strategy so far has closely followed our theoretical model, there are
several aspects in which the true data generating process might be more complicated than the
one implied by our model. First, our model abstracted from dynamic interactions between
sectors, whereas the original Long and Plosser (1983) paper assumed that an industry could
only use as inputs at time t the output produced by other industries at time t 1. This dynamic
structure implies that rather than shocks being transmitted through the Leontief inverse of
the input-output matrix as in our equations (6) and (7), they would be transmitted from one
period to the next directly through the input-output matrix. Over time, this transmission
would still lead to a cumulative impact as summarized by the Leontief inverse (as we show in
Appendix C). Nevertheless, we might be concerned that this type of slow adjustment would
lead to signi…cant misspeci…cation in our empirical work, where we impose equations (6) and
(7). In Appendix C, we conduct a Monte Carlo exercise where data are generated at quarterly
frequency using the Long and Plosser (1983) timing (and shocks are serially correlated), and
regressions are run at the annual frequency using the speci…cations we have utilized so far
(thus …ltering the observed shocks through the Leontief inverse of the input-output matrix).
We …nd that the time averaging of the higher frequency data to annual observations ensures
that speci…cations based on the Leontief inverse do not lead to any major misspeci…cation. In
particular, our results, described in detail in Appendix Figures 4-7, indicate that regressions
run time-averaged data can recover whether upstream or downstream linkages are important.
A second concern is whether measurement error in the input-output matrix might be signi…cantly ampli…ed when we compute the Leontief inverses. Another Monte Carlo exercise we
perform in Appendix C veri…es that even if the input-output matrix is measured with error,
regressions of the sort we have used are capable of recovering the correct parameters. We take
these two Monte Carlo exercises as useful con…rmation of the robustness and informativeness
of our empirical strategy.

Additional Results: The Geographic Network

We next turn to an analysis of the geographic network’s impact on the propagation of shocks.
The theory in Section 2 describes how shocks to an industry can also propagate regionally
(e.g., within commuting zones) because they expand or depress economic activity, impacting
the decisions of other industries in the area. Though a full analysis of these local interactions
is beyond the scope of the present e¤ort (see, for example, the treatment of Acemoglu et al.
(2015) for medium-frequency import shocks on local economies), we can nonetheless get a sense
of the importance of these channels of propagation by looking at the impact of a shock to a
particular industry on other industries that tend to collocate with it. This is essentially the
idea of the geographic network introduced above.

26

Table 8 considers all four geographic e¤ects simultaneously, which is particularly relevant
since they are all working through the same local geographic networks. In Columns 1 and 3
we only model own-industry e¤ects and geographic spillovers, while Columns 2 and 4 add the
downstream and upstream network e¤ects as well. Our most important observation from this
analysis is the stability of the network e¤ects compared to Table 7. The latter continues to
adhere to theory and shows that our network e¤ects are not proxying for regional spillovers
or similar local conditions. The second observation is that the geographic e¤ects are almost
always precisely estimated and are quite substantial in size for demand-side shocks.
Appendix Table 9a shows that these joint patterns are robust to the speci…cation checks
considered earlier for input-output linkages. Appendix Table 9b considers each of the four
shocks in isolation rather than jointly modeling them. Similar to the results presented in
Table 8, the inclusion of geographic e¤ects has little impact on our estimates of downstream
and upstream network e¤ects, which continue to adhere to theory. On the other hand, the
geographic e¤ects themselves are less stable and often substantially smaller when measured in
isolation compared to the joint format. We thus remain cautious about strong interpretations
of the size of the geographic e¤ects compared to the overall stability that these speci…cations
show for our network components.
With these caveats, the economic magnitudes of Table 8’s e¤ects are substantial. Figure
3 in Appendix B shows the impulse response functions including own and network e¤ects in
response to a one standard-deviation shock in speci…cations that also include geographic e¤ects,
further reported in Appendix Table 9c. The implied magnitudes of some of these geographic
e¤ects are quite large and suggest a fruitful and important area for deeper investigation.23

Conclusion

Idiosyncratic …rm- or industry-level shocks could spread through a network of interconnections
in the economy, propagating and amplifying their initial impact. Though their potential import was initially downplayed because of the belief that their aggregation across many units
(disaggregated industries or …rms) would limit their macroeconomic impact, there has been a
recent revival of interest in such network-based propagation of microeconomic shocks. This
paper contributes to an empirical investigation of the role of such propagation, focusing primarily on input-output linkages but also on connections through the geographic collocation
patterns of industries.
One feature that makes propagation through the input-output network particularly attractive for empirical study is that theory places fairly tight restrictions on the form of the
transmission of these e¤ects. In particular, in response to demand-side shocks, upstream
23

Following Autor et al. (2013), Acemoglu et al. (2015) estimate an aggregate reduction of over 1.5 million
manufacturing jobs through direct and network e¤ects from the China trade shocks. In terms of our framework,
their estimates correspond to a combination of own e¤ects and geographic spillovers; they also control for
changes in the underlying population in regions in their econometric speci…cation.

27

propagation (to the suppliers of the directly a¤ected industries) should be more pronounced
than downstream propagation (to the customers of the directly a¤ected industries), whereas
in response to supply-side shocks, the reverse ordering should hold. In fact, when production
technologies and consumer preferences are Cobb-Douglas, there should only be upstream propagation with demand-side shocks and only downstream propagation with supply-side shocks.
Moreover, the quantitative magnitudes of the direct e¤ects and the downstream/upstream
e¤ects are pinned down by theory.
After reviewing these theoretical basics, we turn to an empirical investigation of the propagation of four di¤erent types of shocks — China import shocks and federal government spending shocks on the demand side, and TFP and foreign patenting shocks on the supply side.
In each case, we study these shocks …rst in isolation and then in combination with the other
shocks, and separately estimate own (direct) e¤ects as well as downstream and upstream e¤ects.
Throughout, our focus is on annual variation, which appears more relevant for the question of
macroeconomic ‡uctuations, though we verify the robustness of our results to lower-frequency
analysis.
Our empirical results paint a fairly uniform pattern across the di¤erent types of shocks.
In each case, the patterns are consistent with theory — in the case of demand-side shocks,
upstream e¤ects strongly overshadow downstream e¤ects, which are often zero or in the opposite direction, and the converse is true with supply-side shocks. Moreover, the theory-implied
quantitative restrictions are often veri…ed, excepting the foreign patenting shocks. Equally
important, we also …nd the network-based propagation of shocks to be quantitatively sizable,
and in each case, more important than the direct e¤ect of the shock — sometimes more than
…ve times as important. These patterns appear to be fairly robust across speci…cations and
di¤erent control strategies.
In addition to the propagation of shocks through the input-output network, the geographic
spread of economic shocks could potentially be important. For example, many economic transactions, particularly for non-tradables, take place within the local economy (e.g., a county or
commuting zone). If so, a negative shock to an industry concentrated in an area will impact
…rms and workers in that area. Though a full analysis of this geographic dimension requires
detailed data with geography/industry breakdown, we also undertake a preliminary investigation of these linkages by focusing on the collocation patterns of industries. The idea is simple:
if two industries tend to collocate strongly, meaning that wherever one industry plays a major
role in the local economy, the other industry is also likely to be overrepresented, then shocks
to the …rst industry will tend to be felt more strongly by this collocating industry than other,
geographically less-connected industries. We derive a theoretical relationship showing how
industry-level shocks spread to other industries depending on collocation patterns and then
empirically investigate this linkage.
Our results in this domain are somewhat less robust, but still indicate a fairly sizable

28

impact of the propagation of shocks through the geographic collocation network. In fact,
quantitatively this channel appears to be, if anything, somewhat more important than the
transmission of shocks to the input-output network. Interestingly, however, controlling for this
geographic channel does not attenuate or weaken the evidence we …nd for the propagation of
shocks with input-output network.
Though ours is not the …rst paper showing that certain shocks spread through the network
of input-output linkages (and also of geographic connections), we still consider our paper as
part of the early phase of this emerging literature documenting the empirical power of networkbased propagation of shocks. Several areas of future work look promising from our vantage
point. First, as already noted, the geographic spread of shocks can be better studied by using
data and empirical methods that cover multiple geographic scales and levels of interaction, and
even better would be to incorporate measures of the geographic span of the operations and
plants of multi-unit …rms using the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database.
Second, the input-output network we utilize is still fairly aggregated. The theoretical logic
applies at any level of disaggregation, and even at the level of …rms. Though …rm inputoutput linkages require some care (since many such relations may be non-competitive due to
the presence of relationship-speci…c investments or holdup problems), the same ideas can also
be extended to the …rm-level network of input-output linkages. Atalay, Hortacsu and Syverson
(2014) and Atalay, Hortacsu, Roberts and Syverson (2011) take …rst steps in constructing such
…rm-level networks, which can then be used for studying this type of propagation.
Third, the simple but powerful nature of the theory we have already exploited in this paper
also suggests that more structural approaches could be quite fruitfully applied in this domain,
which will enable more rigorous testing of some of the theoretical predictions of this class of
models. For example, the Leontief inverse matrix also puts a considerable amount of discipline
about the co-movement of value added and employment across industries resulting from shocks
spreading through the input-output network, which can be formally investigated.
Fourth, the role of the input-output and the geographic networks in the propagation of
industry-level (micro) shocks suggests that these networks may also be playing a role in the
ampli…cation of macro shocks — such as aggregate demand, monetary and …nancial shocks —
which appears a generally understudied area.
Fifth, the two types of networks we have focused on are by no means the only ones that
may matter for macroeconomic outcomes. Two others that have recently been investigated are
the …nancial network, which can lead to the propagation and contagion of shocks hitting some
…nancial institutions to the rest of the …nancial system (e.g., Allen and Gale, 2000, Acemoglu,
Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2015a, Elliott, Golub and Jackson, 2014, Cabrales, Gottardi and
Vega-Redondo, 2014), and the idea/innovation network, which can lead to the spread of new
knowledge, innovations and practices (studied, e.g., in Acemoglu, Akcigit and Kerr, 2015, as
well as indirectly in Bloom et al., 2013). Our decision to abstract from these was partly because

29

of our empirical frame, which centers on industry-level shocks, and also because of our focus
on shorter-run ‡uctuations (whereas the propagation of new ideas and innovations through
the innovation network is likely to be more important at …ve- or ten-year frequencies or even
longer). Nevertheless, combining these various types of network linkages may be a fruitful area
for future research.
Finally, in addition to the propagation of shocks to other industries or …rms, the network
linkages emphasized here can also fundamentally change the nature of macroeconomic outcomes
and their volatility. For example, Acemoglu, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi (2014) show how tail
macroeconomic risk can be created from the propagation of microeconomic shocks through the
input-output network, while Schennach (2013) suggests that these types of network e¤ects
may change the persistence properties of macroeconomic time-series. These new areas also
constitute fruitful directions for future research.

Notes: Figure plots estimated response to a one standard-deviation shock taken in isolation. Trade shocks are presented in positive terms to be visually
comparable to the other shocks considered. Network effects focus on upstream contributions for the demand-side shocks of trade and federal spending and
downstream contributions for the productivity shocks of TFP and foreign patenting. Responses are measured through log growth rates per the estimating
equation and translated into levels off of a base initial level of one. The lag structure for the dependent variables includes three lags.

Notes: Downstream networks represent inputs from supplier industries into the focal industry's production, expressed
as a share of the focal industry's sales (e.g., rubber inputs into the tire industry as a share of the tire industry's sales).
Upstream networks represent sales from the focal industry to industrial customers, expressed as a share of the focal
industry's sales (e.g., sales of tires to car manufacturers as a share of the tire industry's sales). Both networks are
measured from the 1991 BEA Input-Output Matrix. Shares allow for flows to non-manufacturing industries and
customers and thus do not sum to 100% within manufacturing. Leontief connections provide the full chain of
interconnections in the network matrix. Geographic overlay is measured as the sum across regions of the interaction of
a focal industry's employment share in the region times the share of regional activity for other industries. Regions are
defined through commuting zones and use 1991 industrial activity from the County Business Patterns database.
Correlations are statistically significant at the 1% level.

Notes: Baseline trade shocks for manufacturing industries are the lagged change in imports from China relative to 1991 US market volume, following Autor et al. (2013). A
negative value is taken such that positive coefficients correspond to likely beneficial outcomes, similar to other shocks. All trade analyses instrument US imports with the rise in
Chinese imports in eight other advanced countries, and this table reports the correlation of the IV component. Baseline federal spending shocks for manufacturing industries are
the lagged log change in national federal spending interacted with the 1992 share of sales from industries that went to the federal government. Baseline TFP shocks for
manufacturing industries are the lagged log change in four-factor TFP taken from the NBER Productivity Database. Baseline patent shocks for manufacturing industries are the
lagged change in USPTO patents filed by overseas inventors associated with the industry. These correlations are presented after year fixed effects are removed from each shock.
The Correlation Coefficient column presents the average pairwise correlation of the given shock series between any two industries.

Notes: Estimations consider network structures and the propagation of trade shocks. Baseline trade shocks for manufacturing industries are the
lagged change in imports from China relative to 1991 US market volume, following Autor et al. (2013). A negative value is taken such that positive
coefficients correspond to likely beneficial outcomes, similar to other shocks. Explanatory variables aggregate these industry-level components by
the indicated network connecting industries. These network explanatory variables are expressed as lagged changes in non-log values. Downstream
and upstream flows use the Leontief inverse to provide the full chain of material interconnections within manufacturing. All trade analyses instrument
the direct and network effects from US imports with the rise in Chinese imports in eight other advanced countries. Upstream=Own test uses the exact
formula discussed in the text and is calculated through unreported auxiliary regressions. Variables are winsorized at the 0.1% level and initial shocks
are transformed to have unit standard deviation for interpretation. Estimations include year fixed effects, report standard errors clustered by industry,
and are unweighted. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Notes: See Tables 2a-5a. Rather than model network shocks directly, estimations consider intermediated approaches where the shock indicated by the column header
instruments for changes in upstream and downstream economic activity in terms of real value added or employment. Estimations control for own shock and use two lags of
upstream and downstream components. In each estimation pair, the first specification considers the focal network element for the shock in question. The second
specification adds in the non-focal element where the first stage fit can be weak.

Notes: See Table 2a. Estimations include additional effects from indicated shocks and the geographic overlay of
industries. Geographic overlay is measured as the sum across regions of the interaction of a focal industry's
employment share in the region times the share of regional activity for other industries. Regions are defined through
commuting zones and use 1991 industrial activity from the County Business Patterns database.

Appendix A: Proof of Proposition 1
Part 1. Let us set government purchases equal to zero for this part of the proof. Recall that
pro…t maximization implies
pj xij
wli
; and li =
:
(A1)
aij =
p i yi
p i yi
Utility maximization in turn yields
pj cj
pi ci
=
:
(A2)
i

j

Since total household income is equal to labor income and in this part we have no government
purchases, we also have
n
X
pi ci = wl;
i=1

which yields

pi ci = i wl; 8i:
Moreover, the …rst-order condition for labor supply implies
0 (l)l

(l)

(A3)

= 1;

and thus labor supply is determined independent of the equilibrium wage rate because given
the preferences in (3), income and substitutions cancel out.
Let us now take logs in (1) and totally di¤erentiate to obtain
d ln yi = dzi +

l
i d ln li

+

n
X

aij d ln xij :

(A4)

j=1

Let us next totally di¤erentiate (A1) to obtain
d ln yi + d ln pi = d ln xij + d ln pj ;
and

d ln yi + d ln pi = d ln li ;
where we have made use of the fact that the wages are chosen as the numeraire and thus
d ln w = 0. Substituting these two equations into (A4), we have
d ln yi = dzi +

l
i (d ln yi

+ d ln pi ) +

n
X

aij (d ln yi + d ln pi

d ln pj ):

j=1

Next recalling that l remains constant, di¤erentiating (A2) and (A3), and combining with the
previous two equations to eliminate prices, we obtain
d ln yi = dzi +

l
i (d ln yi

d ln ci ) +

n
X

aij (d ln yi

j=1

Noting that

l
i

+

n
X

aij = 1, this simpli…es to

j=1

d ln ci = dzi +

n
X
j=1

aij d ln cj ;

d ln ci + d ln cj ):

which can be rewritten in matrix form as
d ln c = dz + Ad ln c
where d ln c and dz are the vectors of d ln ci and dzi respectively, which is a unique solution
given by
d ln c = (I A) 1 dz;
(A5)
in view of the fact that the largest eigenvalue of A is less than 1. Next combining (2) and
(A1), we have
n
X
yj
yi
=1+
aij i ;
cj
j ci
i=1

which implies that

d ln y = d ln c:

(A6)

Then combining (A5) with (A6) we obtain
d ln y = (I

A)

1

dz:

(A7)

This yields the desired result, (6).
Part 2. Normalize z = 0 for this part of the proof. Consider the unit cost function of
sector i, which is
n
Y
l
a
Ci (p; w) = Bi w i
pj ij ;
j=1

where

Bi =

l
i

l
i

j=1

Zero pro…t condition for producer i implies
ln pi = ln Bi +

l
i ln w

+

n
X
j=1

n
Y

aij

aij ln pj for all i 2 f1; ::; ng :

Since the wage is the numeraire (i.e., w = 1), we have li ln w = 0 and these equations de…ne an
n equation system in n prices (for a given vector of productivities z, in this instance normalized
to 1), with solution
ln p = (I A) 1 b;
where b is the vector with entries given by ln Bi .
This shows that, for a given vector of productivities, the equilibrium price vector is uniquely
determined regardless of the value of the vector of government purchases G. Thus demandside shocks have no impact on equilibrium prices, which are entirely determined by the supply
side. But then from (A3), the consumption vector remains unchanged, and from (2), total
net supply of all sectors has to remain constant regardless of the change in G. We can then
obtain the change in the total production in the economy using (2) combined with (A1) and
(A2), which with unchanged prices simply implies
d ln yi = d ln xij and d ln yi = d ln li :
Household maximization implies that, even though prices are …xed, labor supply will change
because of changes in consumption (resulting from government purchases). In particular, the
following …rst-order condition determines the representative household’s labor supply

Appendix C: Omitted Proofs and Results and Monte Carlo Exercises
Details for Example 1
The expressions and Example 1 follow readily from equation (6) in the text or equation (A7) in
Appendix A. We provide the detailed algebra here for completeness and veri…cation. Suppose,
3
Q
1=3
ci (since in
for this purpose and without loss of any generality, that u(c1 ; c2 ; c3 ; l) = (l)
i=1

this case preference heterogeneity does not matter). Recall that the production function for
sector i 2 f1; 2; 3g is:
l

a

yi = ezi li i xijij :

(C1)

In what follows, we denote the supplier of the focal sector i by j and the customer of i by
k (for instance, fi; j; kg = f1; 2; 3g ; fi; j; kg = f2; 3; 1g ; and fi; j; kg = f3; 1; 2g). With this
convention, the resource market clearing condition can be written as
yi = ci + xki :
Combining the …rst-order conditions of the representative household and …rms to eliminate
prices, we can write
ci xij
3ci li
aij =
and li =
:
(C2)
cj yi
yi
Substituting this expression into (C1) we obtain
ci = ezi
l
where ij

jointly, we have

l

(C3)

for i = 1; 2; 3. Solving these three equations summarized in (C3)
ci = ~ i e

where
i

(C4)

i

zi + zj aij + zc aij ajk
;
1 aij ajk aki

and ~ i is a constant: Using the production functions (C1) and optimal labor choices (C2) and
the equilibrium consumption choices (C4), we can express express yi in terms of its intermediate
input use, xij , only. Then combining these with the resource constraints we obtain
yi = ~ i e i + yk ek
where the

i ’s

denote constants. Solving this system of equations gives:
h
i
~i + ~k k + ~j j k
yi = e i
:
1
i j k

Finally, taking the logs and di¤erentiating this expression delivers the desired result:
d ln yi =

dzi + aij dzj + aij ajk dzc
for each i = 1; 2; 3:
1 aij ajk aki

Details for Example 2
Once again the expressions in Example 2 follow from our general results, in particular equation
3
Q
1=3
ci ). Once again we
(A10) in Appendix A (recalling that in this case u(c1 ; c2 ; c3 ; l) = (l)
i=1

provide the algebraic detail for completeness. Note that the unit cost functions for the three
sectors can be written as
l a
Ci (p; w) = i w i pj ij ;
where

pi = Ci (p; w) =

Using the fact that the wage is the numeraire, we can solve for the price system in (C5) as
pi =

; con…rming our general results that prices are constant regardless of
where

demand shocks. Given this constancy, we switch to working with nominal values, which we
denote by a tilde, “~”. Then the resource constraint implies

~ i:
d~
yi = d~
ci + d~
xki + dG
Using the …rst-order condition of …rms, aij =

~ij
y~i ,

we have

d~
xij = aij d~
yi :
Combining this with the resource constraint, we obtain
~ i:
d~
yi = d~
ci + aki d~
yk + dG

(C6)

Recall that the household optimization implies
c~i =

1
(1 + ) 3

~i + G

(1 + ) 3

Di¤erentiating this expression yields
d~
ci =

~ j + dG
~i + G
~k

(1 + ) 3

Combining (C7) in (C6), we arrive at the system of equation (for i = 1; 2; 3):
d~
yi =

~ i + dG
~j + G
~k
dG
~ i:

Solving this system of equations delivers the desired result:

The Long and Plosser (1983) Model
Long and Plosser’s (1983) model is closely related to the one we studied in the main text, with
the main di¤erence that there is a one period delay in production, so that inputs dated t 1
produce output dated t, which implies that shocks spread across industries only slowly. More
speci…cally, the production function for sector i at time t is
l

yi;t = ezi;t li;ti

Y

a

xij;t

1:

(C8)

j=1

The Long-Plosser model also includes capital, from which we abstract to simplify the discussion
here. We also assume that the government budget has to be balanced at each date.
The preferences of the representative household are now de…ned over sequences of consumption bundles as
"
#

X
X
t
ln (lt ) + i
ln ci;t ;
t=0

i=1

factor.1

where 2 (0; 1) is the discount
The representative household can save using a risk-free
asset, with gross interest rate Rt at time t (meaning that one dollar invested at time t 1
in this risk-free asset pays Rt dollars for sure at time t), and because there is no capital, this
asset must be in zero net supply.
Since there is no capital, the resource constraint takes the same form as in the static
economy:
n
X
yi;t = ci;t +
xji;t + Gi;t 1 ;
(C9)
j=1

where we have adopted the timing convention that government spending decisions from time
t 1 are implemented at time t.
An equilibrium is now de…ned as sequence of prices such that markets at each date clear.
The equilibrium in this dynamic model continues to be very tractable and can be represented
by a log-linear equation for the evolution of sectoral outputs as shown in the next proposition.
Proposition C1 In the dynamic Long-Plosser model:
1. The equilibrium evolution of sectoral outputs in the presence of technology shocks (and
no government spending shocks) is given by
d ln yt+1 = A

d ln yt + dzt+1 :

(C10)

2. Suppose that Suppose (l) = (1 l) . Then the equilibrium evolution of sectoral output
in the presence of government spending shocks (and no technology shocks) is given by
!
Pn
~
1
j=1 dGj;t
T
~t ;
d~
yt+1 = I A
+ dG
(C11)
1+
~ t is the vector of nominal government spending across sectors at time t, and y
where G
~t
denotes the vector of nominal sectoral output at time t.
1
Di¤erently from the static model, the utility function is no longer invariant to monotone transformations,
thus Cobb-Douglas and log preferences are no longer equivalent, and we adopt the standard log preferences used
by Long and Plosser (1983).

Proof. Part 1. Since there is no capital, the pro…t maximization of sector i at time t can
be written as

where output prices are discounted by the gross interest rate between dates t and t + 1, Rt ,
because they accrue with one period delay. Consider the dual of this problem, which gives the
unit cost function for sector i as

to ensure zero pro…ts (recall that Rt is known at time t). Given the interest rates representing

and taking logs, we arrive at
ln pi;t+1

which together with (C16) implies

and thus
lt = l for all t.

(C20)

Finally combining this result with (C15) and (C19), we obtain that, regardless of the realization
of the stochastic shocks,

t =
This equation, combined with (C17) gives the law of motion of consumption of the output of
di¤erent sectors as

or as

Consider next the …rst-order conditions of the pro…t-maximization problem, (C12):
aij

pi;t+1
yi;t+1 = pj;t xij;t :

(C22)

Using this expression for substituting for xji;t in the resource constraint, (C9), using the fact
that in this part, Gi;t 1 = 0, and rearranging, we obtain:
1=

ci;t
pj;t+1 yj;t+1

aji

yi;t
pi;t yi;t

and …nally, since from (C18)

Because A’s largest eigenvalue is less than 1 in absolute value, as K ! 1, the last term

t = I
which implies that

i;t

is constant for all i and t, and thus
d ln yi;t = d ln ci;t :

Combined with (C21), this yields (C10).
Part 2. The analysis until equation (C18) from part 1 still applies. This equation needs to
be modi…ed, however, because of taxes to …nance government spending. In particular, At = 0
now implies

(C25)

Next multiplying the resource constraint, (C9), with pi;t to convert it into nominal terms

There are three important features to emphasize. First, despite the intertemporal nature
of the linkages, the equilibrium still takes a simple form, with many of the same features as the
ones that emerged in our static economy. Secondly, and relatedly, equilibrium dynamics in the
case of technology/productivity shocks, summarized in equation (C10), are particularly close
to the responses in the static model derived in the main text. Dynamics in the presence of
government spending shocks are a little more complicated, however, because in this dynamic
environment, changes in government spending a¤ect the interest rate and via this channel
sectoral prices (whereas in the static model prices remained constant in response to changes in
government spending). This complication notwithstanding, equation (C11) still takes relatively
simple form and shows how sectoral outputs evolve in response to changes in government
spending patterns (and we will see its close relationship to equation (7) in the text in the next
^
proposition). Finally, equilibrium dynamics now depend on the input-output matrix, A or A,
and not on the Leontief inverse. This is because, given that one period delay in converting
inputs into output, indirect e¤ects take place over time. Consequently, for tracing the e¤ect
of last period’s output on today’s output, which focuses on direct e¤ect, it is the input-output
matrix that is relevant. Nevertheless, because the indirect e¤ects now accumulate over time,
the long-run response to shocks is again given by the Leontief inverse as we show in the next
proposition.

thus yielding the desired result.
The most noteworthy results in this proposition are the coincidence of equations (C27) and
(C28) with (6) and (7) in the text. In particular, (C27) highlights that the long-run response to
a one-time (permanent) technology shock in this dynamic model is identical to the equilibrium
response to technology shocks in the static model given by (6). Equation (C28), on the other
hand, highlights that the dynamic response to a one-time (permanent) government spending
shock is identical to the equilibrium response to government shocks in the static model given
by (7) provided that the discount factor is close enough to 1. These results underpin our
claims that our results and empirical strategy continue to be valid even if data are generated
by a dynamic model in which shocks spread across sectors over time.

Monte Carlo Evidence
We now use the results of the previous subsection as the basis of our Monte Carlo exercise. We
use the equations of the Long-Plosser model, (C10) and (C11), derived above to trace out the
dynamics of output in response to technology in government spending shocks. We also add an
additional error term to capture other sources of productivity and demand shocks (as well as
measurement error). In the case of technology shocks, equation (C10) thus becomes
technology shocks : d ln yt = A

assumed to be iid. We take productivity and government spending shocks to be persistent
(since we are considering short time periods, such as months or quarters, which will then be
time averaged into annual observations). In particular, we assume that

where t N (0; 1). When time periods correspond to quarters, we set = 0:85; which implies
an annual persistence of 0:52, corresponding approximately to the average persistence of the
shocks we study in our empirical work.
For equation (C11), we approximate Rt ' 1= ' 1, since time periods are taken to be short
(quarters or months), and then use the same steps as in the proof of Proposition C2 to convert
the equation in nominal terms into log changes and thus write (C11) as

We also assume that tf
t ; t are iid and distributed N (0; 10) so as to generate su¢ cient
noise in our simulated data. Throughout, we take the number of sectors to be 392 as in our
empirical work, and we use the actual input-output matrices from the U.S. data that featured
in our empirical work.
For quarterly data, we burn the …rst 160 quarters of simulated data, and then take 20
years of quarterly data, which we then time-average into annual observations, thus giving us
20 years of annual data with 392 sectors, which matches our empirical frame. We repeat this
procedure 1000 times.
We then estimate our main speci…cation from the text, equation (12), on these simulated
datasets. As in our main text, upstream and downstream e¤ects are computed from equations (13) and (14). The following regression equation reports mean values and the standard
deviation of the estimates across the 1000 runs, starting with the case of technology shocks:

Panels A-D of Appendix Figure 4 illustrate the distributions of each coe¢ cient across these
1000 simulations. Both our summary equation and the …gure clearly show that we estimate
no upstream e¤ect and signi…cant downstream e¤ects as predicted by theory. The coe¢ cient
on the lagged dependent variable is zero, re‡ecting the fact that there is no other source of
persistence (such as capital accumulation) in our simulated data. Panel E of the …gure turns
to the implied tests of the theoretical restriction (where we again follow the theory and include
all indirect e¤ects from own shocks together with the own shock). It plots the distribution of
p values of the test for this theory-implied restriction. We see that this restriction is rejected
in about 18% of the cases at the 5% level. This somewhat high rejection rate is a consequence
of the fact that time averaging the simulated data a¤ects the own and downstream e¤ects
di¤erentially. Nevertheless, we …nd it encouraging that in the great majority of the cases, this
restriction is not rejected.

with our theoretical predictions, with one notable di¤erence that, in this case, despite timeaveraging the theory-implied restriction between own and network e¤ects is rejected in about
4% of the cases at the 5% level, approximately as we would expect.

of 20 years of data (480 months). The results for technology shocks are once again similar, as

Measurement Error
Our second Monte Carlo exercise investigates whether measurement error in the input-output
matrix will lead to incorrect inference (partly because this measurement error might be magni…ed in the Leontief inverse). For this exercise, we directly simulate data at the annual frequency
from our baseline model (thus using the Leontief inverse matrices), and since we would like
to investigate whether, in the presence of measurement error, network e¤ects from technology
shocks might be incorrectly identi…ed as resulting from government shocks and vice versa, we
combine (C10) and (C11) and simulate the data in the presence of both types of shocks procreating according to theory as well as additional noise representing other shocks. Namely, we
use the equation
d ln yt+1 =

d ln yt +

down

H

p
dztf

t

up

^

G

t

dzt +

(C31)

where dztf
and dzG
t are the vectors of technology and government spending shocks, and we
t
take them to be iid and distributed N (0; 1). The additional noise t is assume to be distributed
N (0; 1=12) : We set to the average of its empirical estimates, 0.085, and we again use the
^ from the data as in our empirical work. To investigate
Leontief inverse matrices H and H
whether positive downstream (upstream) e¤ects will be correctly identi…ed and whether we

will also be able to estimate precisely zero e¤ects when such propagation is absent, we consider
four di¤erent scenarios for up and down : (i) up = 1; down = 1; (ii) up = 1; down = 0;
(iii) up = 0; down = 1, and (iv) up = 0; down = 0, covering all four possibilities (where
the normalization of the positive e¤ects to 1 is without loss of any generality). We again run
1000 simulations in each case.
In estimating our main empirical model, equation (12), we introduce randomly-generated
measurement error on the actual matrix, so that the matrix we use in the estimation becomes

e¤ects according to equations (13) and (14).
We next report the results of this exercise, starting with the benchmark of no measurement
error when there are both upstream and downstream e¤ects, and then moving to the four cases
indicated above. Throughout, given our motivation explained above, we estimate network
e¤ects from technology and government spending shocks simultaneously.2
Case 0, No Measurement Error,

up

down

In this case, both own e¤ects and network e¤ects are precisely estimated, and are consistent
with theory. In particular, we …nd downstream propagation of technology shocks and zero
upstream propagation of these shocks, and upstream propagation but no downstream propagation of government spending shocks. Quantitatively, own shocks and the relevant network
e¤ects are of the same magnitude as predicted by theory. These results are summarized in the
next equation.

In this case, as shown by the next summary equation, we …nd the expected pattern of downstream propagation of technology shocks and upstream propagation of government spending
shocks, and no upstream propagation from technology shocks and no downstream propagation
from government spending shocks. Moreover, despite the sizable amount of measurement error in the input-output matrices, the estimated magnitudes of the relevant network e¤ects are
consistent with theory: on average, downstream network e¤ects from technology shocks have
the same magnitude as the own e¤ect of technology shocks, and upstream network e¤ects from
government spending shocks likewise have the same magnitude as the own e¤ect of government
spending shocks.

This case is not possible when our theory applies, since upstream propagation in response to government
spending shocks and downstream propagation in response to technology shocks are determined by the same
input-output linkages. Nevertheless, this hypothetical case enables us to investigate whether our regressions
will correctly identify the presence or the absence of these e¤ects when one is present and the other one is not
as might be the case under alternative theories.

Finally, we turn to the case in which there are no network e¤ects, and in this case our equations,
as summarized next, correctly identify no upstream or downstream propagation in response to
either government spending or technology shocks (as well as no own e¤ects).

Overall, these results bolster our con…dence in the reliability of our empirical strategy, even
in the presence of substantial measurement error.
