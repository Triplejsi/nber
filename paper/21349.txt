ABSTRACT
Based on the most comprehensive grain prices available, we employ a storage model to estimate
consistent interest rates and compare capital market development in Britain and China. Interest
rates for Britain were lower than China’s on average by about three percentage points from 1770
to 1860. Regional capital market integration in the Yangzi Delta comes close to the British
average at distances below 200 kilometers, but at larger distances interest rate correlations in
Britain are twice those of the Delta, and three or more times as high as elsewhere in China.
Overall, our results suggest capital market divergence at an early date.

I. Introduction
Why did modern economic growth begin in Northwest Europe, and not in China? Some

time ago Kenneth Pomeranz addressed this classic question in The Great Divergence: China,

Europe, and the Making of the Modern World (Pomeranz 2000), emphasizing the similarities
across Asia and European in factors responsible for growth. 1 Despite the progress being

made over the last years, there is no consensus yet on the cause for the Great Divergence.
Nearly everyone would agree, however, that a relatively low interest rate indicates not only

the abundance of capital but also low levels of risk in capital market transactions (North

and Weingast 1989). Perhaps most importantly, well-developed capital markets allow
surplus to flow to the project with the highest return. 2 They were, for example, an
important factor for early growth in Europe and North America (Davis 1965, Sylla 1969,

Rousseau 2003, Hoffman, Postel-Vinay, and Rosenthal 2011). But how different was capital
market development in China in the late 18th and early 19th centuries compared to Western

regions? Most accounts contrast thick, developed capital markets and low interest rates in

Europe against the less developed Chinese markets starved for capital, but one should not

accept these conclusions at face value (Rosenthal and Wong 2011). 3 In this paper, we
circumvent the lack of data on comparable interest rates by using a storage model with
local grain price information in order to shed new light on capital market development in
Britain and China between 1770 and 1860.

Specifically, the price for a stored commodity must compensate for the cost of storage,

of which the interest rate is a key determinant (Hotelling 1931, Working 1933, 1949,

Kaldor 1939). Holding on to a stored commodity is more expensive the more scarce are the

funds—the higher the interest rate—and the higher is the risk. If there is a ten percent
chance that the commodity is stolen by bandits (or expropriated by the government), the

storer will demand a ten percent higher forward price to compensate for the risk of losing

1 The lasting influence of Pomeranz (2000) is evidenced by the special session “Assessing Kenneth Pomeranz
Great Divergence: A Forum” ten years after publication, Forum (2011).
2 Allen (2009) emphasizes that developed capital markets may have given Europe a relatively strong
incentive for capital deepening, leading to growth. On the link between capital market development and
economic growth, see Bagehot (1857), Schumpeter (1911), and Gurley and Shaw (1955), as well as more
recently Rousseau and Wachtel (1998), Rousseau (1999), and Mitchener and Ohnuki (2007).

etc.—can produce major challenges. For a review and broader discussion, see Rosenthal and Wong (2011).

the commodity. We estimate comparable regional interest rates for Britain and China.

Because comparable data on interest rates are not available, we examine interest rates from

the point of view of an asset held over time, as in McCloskey and Nash (1984). However, we
go further than that.

Building on these interest rates we shed new light on the

development of regional capital markets in Britain and China by studying the integration of
capital markets during the crucial years of economic divergence, from 1770 to 1860. 1

There are several major findings. We find, first, that our interest rate estimates are

typically lower in Britain than in China, with averages of 5.4% versus 8.4% per year,
respectively.

Second, we find that British capital markets were substantially more

integrated than capital markets in China. Bilateral correlations for regions within the
Yangzi Delta come close to the British average at distances below 200 kilometers, but at
larger distances interest rate correlations in Britain are twice those of the Delta. Outside of
the Yangzi Delta regional interest rate correlations are often less than one-third the British

average. And while Britain increased its advantage over China during the period of 1770 to

1860, already by the end of the 18th century there was a substantial gap in capital market
integration between the two countries.

We contribute to a large literature in comparative development that seeks to examine

the divergence between China and Europe and the larger lessons on the causes of growth

and development (Needham 1969, Pomeranz 2000, Rosenthal and Wong 2011, Lin 2014).
Considerable progress has been made in terms of documenting the Great Divergence
through income and national accounts studies (Allen, Bassino, Ma, Moll-Murata, and van
Zanden 2011, Broadberry, Guan, and Li 2014).

Nevertheless, explaining the Great

Divergence has been a greater challenge. While numerous factors have been considered

there is little research on capital market development. 2 By providing a comparable set of
A parallel paper has shown that this storage approach works well in uncovering differences in capital
market development in other early 19th century economies. Matching bank interest rates and grain-price
based rates for several regions in the U.S. during 1815-1855, Keller, Shiue, and Wang (2018) find that the
correlation of average bank and grain rates is high.
2 For an introduction of the Great Divergence debate, see Forum (2011) as well as Brandt, Ma, and Rawski
(2014). Goetzmann et al. (2007) discusses the 19th and 20th century formation of a national stock market, and
the process of the securitization of assets of Chinese firms and government debt. Work referring to capital
markets includes Li and van Zanden (2013) who report that in the late 18th and early 19th centuries annual
interest rates in the Yangzi Delta were between 5% (commercial loans, mortgages) and 25% or higher

regional interest rates that is analyzed to study capital market integration in Britain and
China we provide a new empirical grounding for explanations of the Great Divergence that
refer to capital markets.

Our finding that Britain’s capital market integration was much higher than China’s,

already by the late 18th century, provides initial evidence that capital market development
plays an important role in the Great Divergence. This finding differs markedly from an

earlier paper that demonstrated there was only small gap in the efficiency of China’s

commodity markets relative to those in Europe (Shiue and Keller 2007). 1 The difference

reflects the fact that the within-year price dynamics underlying this study of capital
markets provide very different information compared to the essentially static comparison
of commodity market integration across regions for a given period.

Second, the paper contributes to the quantitative study of capital market development.

Little is known on capital market integration, either historically or on today’s lessdeveloped countries (19th century U.S. and Japan are exceptions, see Davis 1965,

Bodenhorn and Rokoff 1992, and Mitchener and Ohnuki 2007, 2009, respectively). 2 A key

advantage of our storage approach is that it sheds light on capital market development

prior to the 19th century. While we do not study the causal impact of capital markets, our
analysis opens up new lines of research on industrialization and growth that do not require
information on interest rates charged by formal financial institutions.

This is useful

because by the time these have been established, numerous other factors associated with
industrialization have also occurred, making it difficult to assess the causal role of finance. 3

The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces a simple storage cost

approach that we employ to infer interest rates from monthly grain prices. We also discuss

our measures of capital market development to compare China with Britain. Section 3

describes our regional grain price data, as well as supplementary information, in particular
historical weather data. Section 4 contains our main empirical results. First we compare

regional interest rates, followed by studying capital market integration in Britain and China,
(pawnshop rates), compared to 3-5% (commercial loans, mortgages, and government bonds) in the
Netherlands.

concluding discussion in section 5.

2. Empirical Framework
2. 1 Grain Prices, Storage Costs, and Capital Markets
Could underdeveloped capital markets, due to perhaps a general lack of capital as well

as risks in capital transactions, have contributed to the Great Divergence? While there are

many ways to approach this question, we focus on the level of regional interest rates and
the extent of capital market integration, both of which govern the extent to which capital

surplus can be allocated to the project with the highest return. Capital market integration
may be simply measured by the degree to which interest rates in different regions co-move
with each other. The stronger are these co-movements, the more highly integrated are the
capital markets in that area (e.g., Mitchener and Ohnuki 2007, 2009).

In practice, the key difficulty in carrying out this analysis is that strictly comparable

interest rates are generally not available for across regions for Britain and China before the
19th century. 1 This is because the interest rate charged in any particular transaction

depends on a multitude of characteristics—of the borrower, the lender, the type of project,
its maturity, specific risk, time of year, whether there was a security, etc.—and there are

typically not enough transactions of a particular type to allow valid comparisons. Thus,

even though there are numerous and scattered interest rates in historical sources for China,
they are not suitable for systematic comparisons because crucial transaction details are
missing (Pomeranz 1993, 32). Likewise, the absence of comparable regional interest rates

even with Britain during the 18th century is the reason why researchers studying the

emergence of a national English capital market have had to resort to relating the interest
rate in London to the number of real estate transactions in the regions of England

(Buchinsky and Polak 1993). Thus, the first step in our analysis is to construct a set of
comparable regional interest rates, to which we turn now.

Consider an individual living in region i at time t who has harvested grain. The

individual can sell each unit at price Pit or he can store the grain for one period, a

transaction denoted by k, k = 1,…,K. Storing incurs a number of costs. First, the individual
𝑘𝑘
has opportunity costs 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 which are composed of the risk-less rate ρit plus a premium 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
≥
𝑘𝑘
. Two, there are per-unit storage costs of cit,
0 that is specific to transaction k, 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 = 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

which include the effects of mold, mice, etc. on the amount of stored grain. On the other
hand, there is the value of the marginal unit of grain storage, which is usually referred to as

convenience yield. 1 We denote the convenience yield by 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Taken together, the individual
would be indifferent between selling his grain at time t and entering a contract at time t to
𝑘𝑘
sell the grain at time at the forward price of 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+1
when the following condition holds:

(1)

𝑘𝑘
𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+1
= 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 + 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �, ∀𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡, and 𝑘𝑘.

Equation (1) shows that conditional on the current market price of grain, 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , the

higher are storage costs net of convenience yield, the higher must be the price at which the
farmer sells in period t+1. Similarly, the higher is the risk-inclusive interest rate 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 , the

higher has to be the forward price at which the individual sells in period t+1. The interest
rate can be thought of as a particular form of storage cost for which the individual has to be

compensated through forward price.

In our historical setting, we do not observe the transaction-specific forward price

𝑘𝑘
𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+1
. To address this we average equation (1) over all transactions in region i and period

t and work with the expected future spot price, Pit+1

Equation (2) states that the average forward price is equal to the spot price in t+1 adjusted
by 𝜍𝜍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≥ 0. The term ςit captures risk; in the presence of a positive risk premium the

adjusted storage cost 𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as

𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , ∀𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡.

Substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (1) yields
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+1 = 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), ∀𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡,

(1’)

𝑘𝑘
where 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐾𝐾 ∑𝐾𝐾
𝑘𝑘=1 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Equation (1’) shows that for a given price Pit, the higher is the risk-

inclusive interest rate 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , the higher is Pit+1.

To provide further intuition, we simulate a simple model of optimal commodity

storage. Figure 1 shows the equilibrium price and storage levels in a standard model along
the lines of Williams and Wright (1991). The figure shows the equilibrium price for two

levels of interest rates, high (solid line) and low (dotted line), holding all else equal.

Beginning with the former, we see that from period one the price rises until it reaches its

maximum in period seven. This is the increase in value of grain over the year as long as no

new supply hits the market (within-harvest year). Also notice that the storage level is zero

when the grain price is at its maximum, indicating that storage reduces price fluctuations.

With the arrival of the new harvest the price falls and reaches a first minimum in period 8.
This is the beginning of the new harvest year. The price rises again until period 19 when
the maximum is reached, and the cycle repeats itself.

Figure 1 Interest rate and price in a model of storage

The dotted line shows the equilibrium price for a lower interest rate. While the grain

price with a lower interest rate also follows the characteristic see-saw pattern, it is clear
from Figure 1 that it is now noticeably flatter, with a lower amplitude than when the
interest rate is high. Thus, these storage model simulations confirm visually what we know

from equation (1’) that the steeper is the increase of the price within the harvest year the
higher is the interest rate in the economy.

2.2 Alternative Measures of Capital Market Development
We employ two measures to compare the development of capital markets in China

and Britain: interest rates and the integration of regional capital markets. Interest rates
can be obtained directly from equation (1’) to yield
(1’’)

𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =

𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+1 −𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

− 𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , ∀𝑖𝑖, 𝑡𝑡.

The interest rate in region i and year t is equal to the rate of price change adjusted for

storage costs. For our first set of results we will compare mean interest rates between
8

regions in China and Britain. Either capital scarcity or high risks associated with capital
transactions will drive rit in equation (1’’) up.

The regional grain price changes during the harvest year in equation (1’’), 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≡

𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+1 −𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

, is the point of departure. The term πit is computed as the average of one-month

price changes for a given region and year. To sharpen the analysis we restrict the sample

in two ways. First, we eliminate outliers by focusing on the central 95% of the πit for each
grain. Second, we employ only price changes for months in which, on average across all

years, the price change exceeds 0.42% per month (or 5% per year). Throughout the paper,
we calculate annual rates as 12 times the monthly rate. This threshold can be thought of as
a useful way to reduce measurement error by focusing on a genuine upward price gradient
during storage times. At the same time, our main findings do not change if we eliminate

this threshold (see Table 3 and Figure 11). 1 We perform this analysis separately for the

unfiltered and band-pass-filtered data, as well as separately by grain (for China).

Our second measure of capital market development is based on the extent of co-

movement of interest rates across regions. A well-known measure is the contemporaneous
bilateral correlation of interest rates in two regions i and i’, 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖′𝑡𝑡 ). For brevity, we

define 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖′ ≡ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑡𝑡 ), ∀𝑖𝑖, 𝑖𝑖′. This correlation is analyzed for different geographic

distances because due to transport costs and other factors affecting integration, the
correlation falls in distance. Comparing the average of bilateral interest rate correlations

across two countries, the country that has a higher correlation at a given distance is closer

to a fully integrated, national capital market than the other country, and its capital market

is more developed. Below we will employ simple bilateral correlations, noting that with

certain assumptions, studying integration with n > 2 regions simultaneously does not
change our main findings. Furthermore, market integration studies also frequently study

cointegration in an error-correction framework (Shiue and Keller 2004, Mitchener and
Ohnuki 2007). In particular, a recent application of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith’s (2001)

autoregressive, distributed-lag (ARDL) framework produces results consistent with those
In addition, the following calculations of the average πit weigh the observations by the share of non-zero
month-to-month changes. For example, if for one year 10 monthly changes are non-zero and in another only
6, the observations receive weights of 10/12 and 6/12, respectively.

based on bilateral correlations (Keller, Shiue, and Wang 2018). For this reason we can
focus on reporting the latter.

2.3 Discussion: Model and Implementation
The rest of this section discusses two concerns one might have with our approach and

provides a preview of the historical context. First, from an asset-pricing perspective, how
restrictive are the assumptions that allow us to compare regional capital markets? Second,
what can be learned from the grain-storage approach in the context of 18th and 19th century

economies in China and Britain?

Turning first to the asset-pricing perspective, equating the forward price 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+1 to the

expected future spot price Pit+1 may introduce a bias to the extent that there is a positive

risk premium (captured by the unobserved term 𝜍𝜍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 in equation (2)). Furthermore, the

convenience yield 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is unobserved to us. While an application of this framework for a

modern economy would typically employ data on the forward price, the convenience yield

is also unobserved in most analyses on modern economies. In fact, when data on spot and
forward prices, interest rates, and physical storage costs are available, the convenience

yield is typically estimated by solving equation (1) for 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

To reduce the influence of differences in (i) risk driving a wedge between forward and

expected future spot price, in (ii) physical storage costs, and (iii) in convenience yields, we

adopt the following strategies. First, we compare capital market development with two
measures, interest rates and capital market integration. The main advantage of studying

capital market development by examining the strength of the interest rate correlation
across regions is that time-series variation is employed to difference out potentially
important sets of time-invariant factors. In general, the correlation of price changes in

regions i and i’ will not be equal to the correlation of interest rates in regions i and i’ ,
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖′𝑡𝑡 ) ≠ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖′𝑡𝑡 ) because unobserved physical storage costs 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , for example,

may be systematically related to price changes. However, to the extent that 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖′𝑡𝑡 do

not vary over the relevant period of time, 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖′𝑡𝑡 ) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖′𝑡𝑡 ) will hold. The list

of factors that may affect our calculation of interest rate levels in a roughly time-invariant
way over time includes regional storage technology, water access, and other determinants.
10

Furthermore, we provide results for various sub-periods showing that the capital market
integration findings do not vary strongly over time. This provides support that many
factors affecting interest rates according to our approach are in fact time-invariant.

Second, our analysis incorporates time-invariant factors that influence our interest

rate results. Physical storage costs, in particular, are affected by temporary periods of
extreme weather (droughts and wetness). By employing time-varying data on historical
weather by region, our results bear this out: we show that weather-driven storage cost

shocks account on average for more than 20% of the observed within-year price changes;
see section 4.1.

There is nevertheless reason to believe that other time-invariant factors might

influence our findings. In particular, convenience yield, physical storage costs, and risk may

depend on the amount of storage. 1 While comprehensive data on regional storage is

unavailable, regional price levels provide useful information on the inventory levels of

grain. Specifically, if prices are high for a number of consecutive periods, grain inventories
will tend to be low, the risk of a stock-out is high, and convenience yields will

correspondingly be high. Also, years of temporarily high physical storage costs will be
associated with high grain prices because prices have to rise sufficiently to cover these

costs. We will shed light on the role of time-varying factors for our results based on these
considerations in section 4.5.

One might also be concerned that the storage approach is demanding in the context of

18th and 19th century economies. Some information comes from the pattern of monthly
grain prices in China and Britain: Do actual prices share any similarity to those simulated

with our storage model, as shown in Figure 1? The following shows monthly grain prices
for two of our regions, Bedfordshire county and Guilin prefecture, for the years 1828-1860

(Figures 2 and 3, respectively). While there are clearly other influences, in both regions
there are sustained periods in which grain prices are following a cyclical, see-saw-like
pattern akin to Figure 1. In order to distill the see-saw pattern even more strongly we will

adjust for several determinants of grain prices, includes climate, inter-regional trade, and

harvest patterns. 1 The analysis will also employ filtering techniques designed to separate

cycles from trends in time series data. Specifically, we will employ a band pass filter based
on Butterworth (1930). 2

Notes: Data from the London Gazette.

Shiue (2002), e.g., discusses the interaction of storage and inter-regional trade.
Filters may help to bring out more strongly the cyclical properties of the data even though some of them
may not be consistent with all aspects of the price dynamics shown in Figure 1. The Butterworth (1930) filter
is an example of a band pass filter that reduces the influence of both low-frequency and high-frequency
stochastic shocks and cycles. The Butterworth filter is applied because among a whole range of time series
filters (Hodrik-Prescott, Christiano-Fitzgerald, Baxter-King, and others) it performs well under possible
model misspecification (see Keller, Shiue, and Wang 2018 for more discussion and references). We also
employ unfiltered price series because if the model in section 2.1 was correctly specified no filtering would be
necessary. Figure A1 in the Appendix shows an example of unfiltered and Butterworth filtered price data for
comparison.

One might nevertheless be concerned that agents during the sample period may have

been limited in their economic rationality due to constraints on their behavior, and there

may have been, for example, major institutional or technological frictions to arbitrage as

well. 1 We do know, however, that in 18th century China farmers moved back and forth

between cash and grain by trading with merchants. 2 Such shifts in assets would seek to

A well-known critique is Komlos and Landes (1991).
Described in a memorial from the 18th century by a Qing official named Tang Pin in Da Qing li chao shilu,
Gaozong (Qianlong) reign 286: 24b-25a (4154-55); see Pomeranz (1993, 32). Agriculture’s intertemporal
aspects and the link to other parts of the capital market are also illustrated in the following description of the
Xu family (Fujian, 19th century): “Except for the import and export trade of the Chunsheng and Qianhe shops,
the Xus had quite a few storefronts and much arable land for renting in Taiwan. Their real estate was mainly
distributed in towns of Lugang, Fuxing and Xiushui in Zhanghua County, collecting more than 2,000 dan of
grain as rent per year.... Not only selling to rice-purchasers, the Xus also processed the grain themselves and
transported it to the mainland for sale. In addition, they even set foot in loaning business, often lending
money and grain to other firms and people with interest.... In the operation of their businesses, they adopted
diversified investment strategies: managing Chunsheng and Qianhe shops, investing extra capital in other
firms and directly doing business in partnership with others.” (Chen 2010, p. 433, based on Lin and Liu 2006).

dampen price fluctuations as traders tried to find a better return, and there is evidence that
merchants and farmers in Britain did this as well. 1

It goes without saying that neither Britain nor China had perfect capital markets

during the period 1770 to 1860. Our analysis is precisely about quantifying one of the key

frictions in Britain’s and China’s capital markets, namely those preventing the full
integration of national capital markets. The predictions of the storage model will perform

well if local grain prices indeed provide information on local interest rates. If, on the other
hand, farmers were to behave severely constrained or myopically, there would not be

enough grain that enters the market, or capital transactions in agriculture were effectively
unconnected to other parts of the capital market we would find that the storage model
predictions are far off.

The accuracy of our approach has recently been tested by matching interest rates

derived from regional grain prices (and applying the storage model equations above) to
bank interest rates in the same regions during our sample period in the United States
(Keller, Shiue, and Wang 2018). While providing no guarantee for a China-Britain

comparison, the results of this test are encouraging. In particular, Keller, Shiue, and Wang
(2018) find that the correlation of average bank and grain rates is around 0.75 and that the
grain rates capture most of the capital market integration differences across regions.
We now turn to introducing the data.

3. Data
Our Chinese grain prices are from administrative records of the Qing grain price

recording system, which covers each of the 28 provinces from the reign of Kangxi (1662-

1722) to 1911. 2 A key purpose of the Qing price recording system was to inform the

government about the regional market prices of grain to avert food crises and unrest. We

start out with all prefectures located in 20 provinces, which include all of the 18 proper

Everitt (1967) describes the private trading in England, which arose to supplement the town markets and
fairs that had been in operation already over the 16th and 17th centuries. These private traders consisted of
travelling merchants and salesmen who purchased in advance wheat and other goods, connecting the village
farmer to the wider inter-temporal market.

Kraus (1975), and Rawski and Li (1992).

provinces of China. The source reports the price of grain for many different crops across
China depending on different changing climatic and soil conditions. We select four grains
that had the most wide-spread coverage across China: rice, in two different qualities (firstgrade [shangmi] and second-grade [zhongmi]), wheat (xiaomai), and millet (sumi), see
Table 1 for summary statistics. Our final sample has up to 252 prefectures and more than

318,000 monthly grain price observation; see Appendix Table A1 for a list of prefectural
markets and provinces in the sample. 1

Notes: See text for description of data and sources. Last column gives the fraction for which the
one-month price difference is zero in the data.

Wheat accounts for one-third of the observations in China. This is because climatic

conditions in a relatively large portion of China are conducive to growing wheat. In contrast,
Since the rice varieties for which prices are recorded in Zhejiang province are special, markets from this
province are not included in our analysis. We have verified that adding Zhejiang prefectures despite the
difference in grains does not change our main findings.

rice is present mostly in the central and southern provinces, while millet is grown mostly in

northern provinces. Since storage costs may differ by type of grain, it is useful that in

addition to information on wheat for both China and Britain we have information on three
additional grains in China.

The source of the grain prices for Britain is the British government’s Corn Returns,

which were printed in the London Gazette. The newspaper published the price of domestic
wheat at weekly frequencies at the town or county level in order to provide information on
price dispersion in food products across Britain. The Corn Returns were created to provide

a reference market price of domestically produced wheat that would inform taxation and
the regulation of international trade of wheat. Our sample consists of the monthly price of

wheat for the period 1770 to 1860, in up to 52 counties (see Appendix Table A2 for a list).

These prices are widely considered to be market prices. Our sample for Britain consists of
around 48,000 monthly grain price observations. Summary statistics are given in Table 1.

Chinese grain prices are quoted in tael per shi (about 103 liters), while British prices

are quoted in shillings per bushel (about 36 liters). Notice that the one-month price change
for British counties is rarely recorded as zero, in contrast to Chinese prefectures where this

is quite frequent (Table 1, last column). Because zeros as recorded price changes may also
indicate a lower-quality data collection, in our calculation we will give greater weight to

non-zero price changes. 1 At the same time, the overall variation in prices in China and

Britain is comparable. In particular, the coefficient of variation in Britain is 0.349, while in
China for wheat it is 0.355 (Table 1). This confirms that the price variation needed for

analyzing the within-harvest year price gradient calculation is present in both the British
and the Chinese data.

There are some differences in the specific characteristics of the Chinese and British

price data. In particular, in China the regional price is the mid-point price, defined as the

average of the highest and lowest price recorded in the prefecture in that month, whereas
for British counties it is the average price. 2 Furthermore, the Chinese data is in general less
complete than the British data, although coverage improves with the year 1820 (see Figure

1 We apply as weights the figures in Table 2, last column. In practice this means rice-based rates become
relatively more and wheat-based rates relatively less important in the analysis for China.

county after 1820; see the Appendix for details.

4). The increase in the number of regions is the result of greater data availability due to a

reprint of the grain price data (Yishiguan 1990). In Britain, the number of counties in the
sample is on average 45. There is information for almost all 52 counties between 1790 and

1820, whereas during the 1820s the number of counties is about 35. The change in

regional coverage in Britain reflects in part in the influence of certain interest groups upon

British legislation (see Brunt and Cannon, 2013). We will examine in section 4.5 whether
these factors have a strong influence on the results. A number of other aspects of the grain
prices are noted in the Appendix.

Notes: Authors’ analysis, see section 3.

Note that regions in China are typically larger than regions in Britain. Furthermore,

the number of years for which we estimate interest rates for the typical British region

exceeds that of the typical Chinese region. We conduct a number of robustness checks
below that evaluate the role that these and other data features play for our results (see
section 4.5).

In addition to grain prices from these sources, for each region we also employ time-

series filtered price data as an alternative. Table 1 shows summary statistics for grain
17

prices filtered with the Butterworth (1930) band pass filter. Furthermore, storage costs
might change over time in relationship to climatic conditions. For example, clean and dry
grain can be stored for longer periods, whereas very wet conditions are conducive to mold
unless the grain is well protected against moisture. We have collected annual information

on climatic conditions at the regional level to take into account how weather variations
might affect storage costs.

The historical data on Chinese weather comes from the State Meteorological Society

(1981). The source contains historical weather data in the form of contour maps based on
the climate in autumn at 120 weather stations throughout China over the years of analysis.

Based on these contour maps and the location of each prefecture we categorize the climate
in a given prefecture for a given year as ranging from 1 (a lot of rainfall leading to very wet

conditions) to 5 (little rainfall leading to very dry conditions), with 3 being the normal level
of rainfall. Reference to a “normal” regional climate implies that the average climate is

close to level 3 (with an average of 2.92 for the prefectures in our sample). Figure 5
summarizes this data on climate over time across the Chinese prefectures.

We construct data on the climate in Britain with the precipitation reconstructions

from Pauling et al. (2006) according to the definitions of wetness in the Chinese data. 1 As a

consequence, the mean (i.e. normal) climate level is, as in the Chinese data, roughly 3.

Figure 6 shows the variability of weather in Britain. Also the standard deviation of rainfall
in a given year across regions is shown in Figures 5 and 6. On average the standard
deviation is higher in China than in Britain, no doubt in part because of China’s relatively

large size. For a given region in China or Britain, weather variability over the sample
period is comparable, with a standard deviation of 0.98 in China and of 1.16 in Britain.

We use annual rainfall for Britain to avoid introducing a time-varying difference between the British and
Chinese weather data given the distinction between lunar and solar months.

To examine how interregional trade and cropping patterns can affect grain price

behavior between harvests, the empirical analysis below also employs indicator variables

for waterway location and areas where multiple crops can be harvested in a given year. We
include the major waterways in the analysis (Watson 1972, Paget-Tomlinson 1993): the
19

Yangzi and the Pearl river in China, and the Thames, Trent, Severn, and Lea in Britain;
among the canals we focus on the Grand Canal in China and the Bridgewater Canal in
Britain. We also take account of coastal location; for China given its size this is done
separately for the North and the South, as well as for the Yangzi delta.

In terms of differences in cropping patterns, the most important factor is that in parts

of Southern China, rice can be harvested twice in a given year (Chuan and Kraus 1975,
LeClerc 1927). We account for this by including an indicator variable for these regions.

4. Empirical results
4.1 Grain Price Changes and Interest Rates in Britain and China
We begin by showing evidence on the average percentage grain price changes, 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , also

referred to carry costs of grain, before turning to the interest rates. The mean monthly

price change for British counties based on the log wheat price series is about 0.85%, or

10.2% per year (Table 2). In contrast, across all Chinese regions and based on all grains,

the mean is about 13.7% annually. Results based on filtered price series are shown in the
lower part of Table 2. These figures are generally lower than for those based on the
unfiltered time series, consistent with the idea that time series filtering removes stochastic

trends. According to the filtered series, British price changes average around 8.2% per
year while Chinese price changes are around 9.6%. Additional analysis across different

types of grain for China shows that the differences across grains are small. This is plausible
because storage costs and other factors are unlikely to vary greatly across grains. 1

The analysis by grain also provides evidence on the influence of the frequency of non-zero price changes
(last column, Table 1).

China

Having estimated the average monthly price changes over the growing season, the

following section is concerned with assessing the part in these price changes that is due to

non-interest rate factors, especially physical storage costs. To do so we perform a threestage adjustment to purge the influence of climate, water access and cropping pattern from
the average annual price changes.

Our proxy for climatic conditions is 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , defined as the rainfall level in region i and

year t measured in five bins. 1 We perform OLS regressions separately for each larger
geographic area of the price change 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 on 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 to obtain the average price change for

each rain level. 2 The level of 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 with the lowest average price change is assumed to be
the climate with the lowest storage costs. We adjust the price change of region i and year t

Our climate data varies from 1 (highest level of rain) over 3 (normal levels) to 5 (lowest level of rain); see
the Appendix for details.
2 Larger areas are defined as the provinces of China. We assume that all British counties belong to the same
larger geographic area.

using the difference of the OLS estimates for the lowest-storage cost climate and the actual

climate in that region and year. The resulting price changes are those that would have

prevailed had the climate always been such that storage costs were minimal for all regions

and years. This adjustment ensures that any difference in the price changes in China and

Britain is not driven by climatic effects. Table 3 shows the results in column 2.

Our results confirm that climate has a substantial influence on storage costs and

within-harvest year grain price changes. Comparing the previous figures with the climateadjusted figures shows that in the case of the unfiltered series, the climate-adjusted figures

are around five percentage points lower than the figures that are gross of climate-induced

storage costs (columns 1 and 2, Table 3). There is also a substantial difference between
climate-adjusted and unadjusted price changes using filtered price series (Panel B).

At the same time, adjusting for climate does not overturn our earlier finding that price

changes tend to be lower in Britain than in China. This is because the extent to which

variation in climate affects storage costs does not differ very much between China and

Britain. It is around 4 to 5 percentage points for price changes based on unfiltered series
and 2 to 3 percentage points for price changes based on bandpass filtered series.

We now turn to adjusting for the impact of inter-regional trade. To do so we employ

regional information on access to water transport, which was the low-cost mode of

transport for grain at the time. 1 The climate-adjusted price changes are projected on

indicator variables for river, canal, or coastal water access using an OLS regression. Based
on the resulting coefficients we compute price changes standardized for the lowest-storage

cost climate and no access to water transport. The average of these figures is shown in
Table 3, column 3. Comparing columns 2 and 3 we see that inter-regional trade does not

have a major influence on intra-harvest year price changes once climate variation has been
taken into account.

Information on trade volumes within China becomes only available towards the end of the 19th century (see,
e.g., Keller, Santiago, and Shiue 2017 for an analysis).

Finally, we adjust for differences in harvest patterns. This might matter because

rice was typically harvested twice each year in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi

provinces. Defining an indicator variable that is equal to one for regions in which
such double cropping was possible, we perform a regression adjustment analogous

to that for climate and inter-regional trade. Column 4 in Table 3 gives the average

price changes that adjust in addition to low-cost climate and no water access would
have prevailed in the absence of double cropping. We see that the influence of

harvest patterns is quite small, no doubt in part because it affects only a subset of
regions. 1

These three adjustments of the price changes πit yield our interest rates rit,

using the storage cost approach. Among the factors affecting storage costs 𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 we

find climate to be the most important. The average interest rate for Britain is about

5.3% and for China it is about 9.2%. Employing time-series filtered grain price
series the averages are 5.4% and 7.5%, respectively. Thus, there is evidence that

interest rates in China were substantially higher than in Britain over the sample
period 1770 to 1860, by about two to four percentage points. 2 At the same time, the
difference is not as large as one might expect given the existing literature.

The reported standard deviations in Table 3 show that the interest rates exhibit

a relatively large amount of variability. Interest rates can be high when shocks lead
to sharp price increases, and they can be low and even negative in particular years

as well. With relatively few observations it might be difficult to estimate the typical
level of interest rate. With this in mind, Figure 7 shows the smoothed interest rate

average for Britain and China between 1770 and 1860. The average British rate is
consistently between 5 and 6%, while the average Chinese rate fluctuates between
1 Interactions between climate, water access, and cropping patterns do not have a major influence on
our results. Note that by relying on nominal price changes, our analysis estimates nominal, not real
interest rate estimates. Studies of early capital market development using bank interest rates
typically focus on nominal interest rates as well because there is often little systematic data to
construct local price indices (other than grain price data). We have also considered the possible
influence of double-cropping of wheat and barley, which is noted by Perkins (1969), finding its role
to be negligible for our main results.

cropping patterns.

Notes: Data from State Meteorological Society (1981)

The impact of employing all months with a gradient greater than 0 in the

interest rate calculation (as opposed to the 5% threshold in column 4) is shown in

column 5 of Table 3. The interest rate averages tend to fall, which is not surprising
because more months without grain storage are included in the analysis. At the

same time, on average British rates are still lower than Chinese rates by close to one

percentage point (see column 5). Thus, the finding of relatively low British rates is

robust to taking the broad approach of computing storage price gradients with all
months that show positive price changes.

We now turn to our second measure of capital market performance, the

regional integration of markets.

4.2 The integration of capital markets

25

This section compares the capital market performance in Britain and China in

terms of bilateral correlations of regional interest rates over time. A high level of

correlation indicates strong forces that integrate capital markets across the two
regions.

The degree of capital market integration typically falls in geographic

distance. For one, in historical contexts capital market participants often had to

meet in person to trade, and in the presence of costs of moving in geographic space
there will be fewer such meetings. Even when trades are made indirectly through
middlemen, geography is often an important barrier. Information about investment

projects, trust, and enforcement for example will tend to be more difficult as
geographic distance increases.

We therefore report bilateral correlations for

different distances, from 0-100 kilometers to 500-600 kilometers. 1 Let 𝛾𝛾𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐 denote

the average bilateral interest rate correlation within the dth distance bins in country
c, with d = 1,…,6 and c = B or C, for Britain and China, respectively.

Figure 8 shows the average bilateral correlation by distance bin based on the

interest rates of all regions in each country over all years from 1770 to 1860. For

each country, two curves are shown, one for capital market integration based on

unfiltered and the other based on time-series filtered grain price data. The main
takeaway is that the integration of British capital markets was considerably higher

than that of China’s capital markets. Looking at correlations based on unfiltered
interest rates (solid lines), for distances below 100 kilometers 𝛾𝛾1𝐵𝐵 = 0.8 for Britain

while 𝛾𝛾1𝐶𝐶 is less than 0.6 in China. Even more striking is the difference in capital

market integration at higher distances. While in China the correlation falls from

about 0.6 to around 0.1 as distance increases, in Britain the correlation falls only
from 0.8 to 0.7 for the same increase in distance.

It is worth noting that although correlations for filtered interest rates are

generally somewhat lower, the comparison between Britain and China based on the
filtered interest rates yields very similar patterns. At short distances, interest rate
correlations in Britain are higher than in China: 0.7 compared to 0.4, respectively.
We cap the analysis at 600 kilometers because the maximum distance between any two British
county capitals in our sample is 638 kilometers.

1

26

Furthermore, the evidence that capital markets were integrated over larger
distances is much stronger for Britain than for China.

Notes: Figure shows average bilateral interest rate correlations for each geographic distance
bin. Results based on interest rates summarized in Table 3, column 4.

Tables 4 and 5 give a more complete picture by separating out individual grains

and reporting additional information on the bilateral correlations (the latter Table is
based on filtered price series). First, as expected, all interest rates correlations fall

with distance. Second, for China the results indicate some differences across grain

types. For example, Table 5 reports correlations in the 300-400 kilometers range of

0.12 for millet-based interest rates to 0.17 for rates based on (second-grade) rice.
This provides initial information on regional differences because millet is primarily
grown in Northern China whereas rice is mostly grown in Central and Southern

China. In Britain, the average correlation at this distance is with 𝛾𝛾4𝐵𝐵 = 0.65
considerably higher. The highest interest rate correlations in China are found for

first-grade rice at distances below 100 kilometers (0.65; Table 4). At a given

distance, the average bilateral correlation is always lower in China than in Britain as
cell-by-cell comparisons in Tables 4 and 5 show.

An even more complete picture of capital market integration emerges by

comparing the full distribution of bilateral interest rate correlations in China and in
Britain.

In Figure 9A we show those distributions plotted against bilateral

geographic distance. The hollow circles mark bilateral interest rate correlations in

Britain, and the plus-signs mark observations for China. The British circles fill out
the upper part of the figure, indicating higher levels of capital market integration for

a given distance. The figure also shows the smoothed mean correlation for China
(dashed line). Figure 9B shows the same figure with the Chinese markers hidden. It
makes clearer that the observations for Britain are positioned almost entirely above
the China smoothed line.

The evidence in Figure 9A and Figure 9B strongly

indicates that the degree of integration of British capital markets exceeded the
integration in Chinese capital markets over the sample period 1770-1860.

The analysis has shown that capital market integration in Britain was higher

than in China. However, with China having several times the size of Britain, it is

important to ask how the most developed areas of China compared to Britain. The

following section focuses on the Yangzi Delta, the most advanced area within China
from an economic development viewpoint.

4.3 Britain versus the Yangzi Delta
Pomeranz (2000) emphasizes that a comparison of other parts of the world

with China should account for the heterogeneity within China, given her large size.

To be specific, we should not compare capital markets in the relatively less

developed regions of China’s vast territory with capital markets in Lancashire,
where the world’s first factory-based textile industry emerged.

We show results that distinguish less from more developed regions with in

China in Table 6. The average interest rate correlation in China’s Yangzi Delta is
0.47 at distances below 100 kilometers, higher than outside of the Delta (0.42, last

row). There is also evidence for relatively high capital market integration in the

Delta at distances above 100 kilometers (column 2 and 3). Our results are in line
with other evidence that the Yangzi Delta was relatively highly developed.

Notes: Interest rates based on time-series filtered data (summarized in Table 3, Panel B,
column 4). “Yangzi Delta” prefectures are particular prefectures that are noted in Table A1.
“Rice” is first-grade and second-grade rice. “All Grains” here is rice plus wheat.

Furthermore, one may want to concentrate on rice interest rates in the Yangzi

Delta, rather than any other grain. Rice was the Yangzi Delta’s most important grain,
and rice quotations might therefore be more reliable than those for other grains.

Correlations of rice interest rates show figures of around 0.6 for distances below
200 kilometers (row 2). Notice that a correlation of around 0.6 is also obtained at
these distances for Britain (see row 1). At distances above 200 kilometers, however,

correlations in Britain are almost twice as high as those in the Yangzi Delta (0.55
versus 0.30).

This section has shown that while capital market integration in the Yangzi Delta

over short distances was high by most standards, given the drop-off in the Yangzi

Delta above 200 kilometers British capital market integration exceeded that of
China even in China’s most developed areas.

4.4 Capital market development and industrialization
An important question is whether Britain’s advantage in capital market

development existed already in the late 18th century or whether it may have been

merely the consequence of the Industrial Revolution that had taken hold of Britain
32

in the late 18th century. Figure 10 shows bilateral interest rate correlations in China

and Britain for the years 1770 to 1794.

Comparing it with Figure 9, which shows bilateral interest rate correlations for

the entire sample period (1770 to 1860), it is striking finding how large Britain’s

advantage over China already was during the period 1770 to 1794. Given the stark
difference during the period 1770 to 1794, as shown in Figure 10, a large gap must

have existed well before the onset of Britain’s own higher rate of economic growth

with the industrial revolution. If we were to follow convention and use 1770 as the

start date of British industrialization, our findings are consistent with capital market

development being an important factor in explaining why Britain industrialized first.
Whether Britain’s early industrialization was caused by its relatively high capital

market development remains an open question; however, our comparison with
China has established that this is a pressing question.

We now turn to several other potentially important factors in this analysis.

4.5 Further Discussions
4.5.1 Region size and the role of spatial aggregation
Chinese prefectures are on average roughly twice as large as British counties.

To see the implications of this we have paired up the 52 British counties into 26
regions of roughly similar size. Taking the same steps as before for these larger

British regions, we compare bilateral interest rate correlations resulting from this

set of 26 regions with the results from before based on the 52 counties. In Table 7,

the latter are denoted by “Baseline” (left two columns) while the former are denoted
by “Aggregated”.

Notes: All results are for Britain. Shown in the Baseline columns are results for 52 counties.
In the Aggregated columns, the 52 counties are aggregated to 26 regions that on average
closely resemble the size of a Chinese prefecture.

34

We see that aggregation increases the correlations somewhat. Furthermore, it

does so for all geographic distance categories. This implies that our findings are not
driven by the relatively small size of the regions in Britain. On the contrary, if
anything the difference in region size has put Britain at a disadvantage relative to
China.

4.5.2 Storage months
We are interested in the effect of adding relatively flat parts of the within-

harvest year price curve on the interest rate correlations. The dashed line in Figure

11 depicts the average correlations using this broader definition of storage months,

which is compared with the baseline results (solid in Figure 11). Generally, the
broader definition of storage months leads to a lower degree of capital market
integration. However, irrespective of whether we adopt the preferred or the

broader definition of storage months, there is evidence that the integration of
capital markets in Britain was higher than in China.

4.5.3 Convenience yields, volatility, and inventories

Since convenience yields are unobserved we employ price information to

identify periods of high inventory, exploiting the well-established inverse
relationship between inventories and convenience yields. Table 8 provides results

for three alternative criteria that give periods of low convenience yields, based on
current and past price levels as well as price volatility (see the Notes to Table 8).
These criteria are applied in the same way to both Chinese and British regions.

Table 8 reports average interest rate correlations for the subsamples that

satisfy the particular low convenience yield criteria. Across the board, we see that
the analysis confirms a higher level of capital market integration in Britain than in

China. It is thus unlikely that variation in convenience yields over time and across
regions is important for explaining our findings.

4.5.4 Sample composition and zero grain price changes

There are on average more than 170 Chinese prefectures in the sample for a

given year, with just under 150 prefectures before 1820 and around 215 thereafter.
36

In Britain, the number of counties in the sample is on average 45. There is

information for almost all 52 counties between 1790 and 1820, whereas during the
1820s the number of counties is about 35.

Because such changes might affect the results we have conducted the analysis

of capital market integration for the period before and after 1820 separately (see
Table 9). 1 As it turns out, even though the change in the number of regions from

one period to the other is at times substantial, we do not see evidence that this
systematically affects the results for Britain. For China, there is some evidence for

lower levels of integration after the year 1820 for short distances. This finding,

however, is to some extent reversed at distances between 500 and 600 kilometers,
leaving no clear overall pattern.

Notes: Results for average of bilateral correlations of interest rates based on filtered wheat
prices. Standard deviation in parentheses.

We have also examined the role of unchanged month-to-month prices for our

results. As shown in Table 1, generally British prices exhibit more non-zero price
changes than the price series for China. This raises the question whether the higher
1

This also sheds light on the role of the British Corn Laws (1815-46) for our results.

37

share of non-zero price changes explains our findings of relative capital market
development.

To address this issue we have exploited differences in the share of zero price

changes across the four grains in China. For example, there are about 50% fewer
zero price changes for first quality rice than for wheat in the data (Table 1, last

column). We relate these differences across grain to the average bilateral interest

rate correlations by grain given in Tables 4 (unfiltered data) and 5 (filtered data). It
turns out that there is no significant relationship between the share of zero price

changes by grain and capital market integration by grain using filtered price series. 1

For our measures of capital market integration based on unfiltered prices, there is a
significant positive relationship, however it cannot explain our finding of relative
capital market integration. Specifically, if Chinese series had the same share of zero
price changes as the British, the average bilateral correlation for China would be

0.48, compared to 0.74 for Britain. 2 Thus, even if we were to believe that there is a
relationship between non-zero price changes and measured market integration, the
effect would not be big enough to explain our findings.
4.5.5 Capital market integration and time series length
Another issue may be that we calculate the interest rate correlations based on

different numbers of annual observations. For some pairs there are interest rates
over the entire sample period 1770 to 1860, while for others only for a subset of

years. Any difference between China and Britain in this respect might matter if the
strength of interest rate correlation is related to time series length. We analyze this

issue by examining correlations for all region pairs with a fixed number of years,
namely 50 to 70 years. See Table 10 for the results.

We see that time series length plays some role for the results. Generally, we

find little difference in using all pairs versus the pairs with 50 to 70 years of data for

1 An OLS regression of the average bilateral correlation across all 6 distance bins from Table 5 on the
share of non-zero price changes yields a slope coefficient of 0.23 and a s.e. estimate of 0.35.
2 The OLS regression of the average bilateral correlation across all 6 distance (y) from Table 4 on
non-zero price changes (x) gives 𝑦𝑦� = 0.16 + 0.32𝑥𝑥; employing the x value of Britain (which is 0.994)
gives 0.16 + 0.32 × 0.994 = 0.48.

38

Britain (Table 10, columns 1 and 2). For China, the focus on pairs with 50 to 70

years of data leads to higher average correlations (compare columns 3 and 4). As a

consequence, controlling for time series length moves China’s market integration
closer to the levels observed in Britain. Nevertheless, at distances above 300

kilometers, however, correlations for British regions are typically still more than
twice as high as those in China.

Summarizing the analyses in sections 4.5.1 to 4.5.5, we do not find strong

patterns except for time series length, which favors Britain, and region size, which

favors China. Overall, our finding of higher levels of capital market integration in
Britain than in China is robust.

39

5. Conclusions
We have shown that Britain had an advantage over China in terms of the

development of its capital market, which manifested itself both in lower interest

rates and in higher capital market integration. Comparable interest rates in China
were on the order of two to four percentage points higher, and market integration
was substantially lower in China than in Britain, even in China’s most developed
areas once we move outside relatively short distances.

Our finding of lower integration of capital markets means that capital was not

flowing to the location of efficient use in China to the extent it did in Britain. The
differential in interest rates levels, by contrast, was not very large. This suggests

that is was not capital scarcity that mattered so much as the appropriate allocation
of existing capital. It is useful to compare this result with commodity market

integration. During the 18th century, Britain was slightly ahead, but not by such large
margins (Shiue and Keller 2007). In addition, European commodity integration

dramatically improved shortly after the 19th century, whereas there does not appear
to be sharp jumps in capital market integration. This suggests that not only were

British capital markets much more integrated than they were in China, and
therefore working much better, but the lack of large improvements in capital market

integration suggests that these markets were already operating fairly well in Europe.
It may also be an indication that improvements in capital markets take longer to
establish and operationalize effectively.

Further research is needed to determine what explains the lower regional

capital market integration in China compared to Britain. Some accounts suggest that

the wealthy in China in the 18th and 19th centuries did not conduct much capital
accumulation. The salt merchants of Yangzhou, for example, the wealthiest
merchants of this time, saw their wealth dissipate in a few generations (Ho 1954).

Investments flowed into political connections or for the grooming of sons to enter
the civil service examinations and a career in officialdom, rather than towards the
preservation or expansion of family wealth.

40

Another possible explanation is that the Chinese empire, up until the Taiping

Rebellion of the 19th century, was a balanced budget state, meaning that it never
borrowed, and therefore had no experience with bonds and other financial
instruments. The first stock market in China was introduced by foreigners

(Goetzmann, Ukhov, and Zhu 2007). 1 In England, by contrast, the state as well as
state-backed ventures such as the East India Company created opportunities and
investment strategies with financial innovations such as limited liability joint stock
companies. There is probably some truth to this state finance hypothesis, although
very little is known at this point on its quantitative importance.

Our finding of low capital market integration over long distances in China is

consistent with the hypothesis that borrowing and lending is segmented
geographically because of the importance of local lineages (common descent

groups). Along these lines, China’s relatively low capital market integration would

reflect the delayed transition in China from kinship-based financial transactions to
impersonal transactions, especially those involving banks.

Regardless of the reasons, the large gap in capital market integration that

results matters to economic efficiency in ways that are distinct from commodity

markets. Whereas commodity markets match buyers and sellers, as in an
endowment economy model in which lychees and apples fall from trees and are in

turn traded for other consumption goods, capital markets, in contrast, channel
resources from individuals willing to postpone consumption to others with

productivity-enhancing projects that pay off in the future. The finding of low
regional capital market integration provides evidence that the process of matching

savers and investors in China was mostly a local one, leading to a lower allocative
efficiency of capital than in Britain.

See Keller and Shiue (2017) for a study the implications of China’s opening following the First
Opium War (1840-42).

Appendix
Chinese grain price data
The price reports are originally from the Gongzhong zhupi zouzhe, nongye lei,
liangjia qingdan [Grain Price Lists in the Agricultural Section of the Vermilion
Rescripts in the Palace Archives], which records monthly prices on the lunar
calendar. These data exist on microfilm (Yishiguan 1990) and in published volumes
from the Daoguang reign onwards (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 2009).
Original price reports were made at the county level. However, these records no
longer exist. What we have today are prices for a higher administrative unit, the
prefecture. A prefectural high price and a low price are given at lunar month
intervals. The high price is the highest county price within the prefecture, and the
low price is the lowest county price for that period. We use the mid-point price, and
map that to the location of the prefectural capital. Quantity units are in units of “shi”,
where 1 shi = 103 liters. The original monetary units are in “liang”, or the Chinese
silver tael.
Chinese weather data

The Chinese rainfall data comes from the compilation published by the State
Meteorological Administration (1981) from a variety of historical sources, including
local histories and gazetteers. Weather for each year for 120 “stations” throughout
China, a regional designation that is equal to one or two prefectures, is tabulated in
this source. A ranking of one to five is used to summarize the impact of the “wetness
and dryness” of weather changes from floods, droughts, monsoons, or rainfall, as
opposed to other weather phenomenon such as windstorms or temperature
changes. The ranking of weather for all regions in China, however, can be seen in the
annual contour maps of weather provided, and all prefectural locations were filled
in by examining the weather in the closest nearby stations.
46

The scale of rainfall is defined as follows by the compilers as follows: “Level 1
represents years in which there have been exceptional rainfall, leading to major
floods, typhoons, water related disasters, and the destruction of all crops. Level 2
encompasses cases where there is heavy rainfall, but limited in scope and/or
resulting in only minor flooding. Level 3 should be interpreted as normal weather,
neither very wet nor very dry, and therefore the most favorable weather for that
locality. Level 4 indicates minor droughts of limited consequences, while level 5
denotes the years of greatest drought, lasting two or more seasons of the year, and
leading to major harvest failures.” Over all years (1470-1979) and all regions
(mainland China, Taiwan, excluding Mongolia) considered, the five categories are
classified by the authors such that years and regions ranking level 1 and 5 in
severity each appear with a frequency of 10 percent, ranks of level 2 and 4 each
appear with a frequency between 20-30 percent, and the rank of level 3 accounts for
30-40 percent of the total distribution. In particular, the scale of rainfall is classified
as follows:
Level 1: Ri > ( R + 1.17σ~ )
Level 2: ( R + 0.33σ~ ) < Ri ≤ ( R + 1.17σ~ )
Level 3: ( R − 0.33σ~ ) < R ≤ ( R + 0.33σ~ )
i

Level 4: ( R − 1.17σ~ ) < Ri ≤ ( R − 0.33σ~ )
Level 5: Ri ≤ ( R − 1.17σ~ )

where,
Ri = relative wetness of year i, between the months of 5-9.

R = average wetness between the months 5-9 over all years.

σ~ = standard deviation.

The weather variable used in the first stage adjustment of carry costs is the absolute
value of the actual rainfall level’s deviation from the normal weather (level 3)

Distance

Distance calculations employ Playfair's (1965) listing of latitude and longitude
measurements of prefectural cities based on their historical locations for China. The
distance calculation between two points uses the Haversine Formula.
British wheat price data

We created the county-month wheat prices for British between 1770 and 1860 with
the British government’s Corn Returns published weekly in the London Gazette.
Before 1820, only county weighted averages of grain prices were reported. From
October 1820, however, the weekly Corn Returns include prices in all market towns
within each county, as well as information on quantities sold (Adrian, 1977). Hence,
47

for the period 1821-1860, we construct the monthly prices as the weighted averages
of prices across market towns, using quantities as weights.
British weather data

We use the precipitation reconstructions from Pauling et al. (2006) to obtain our
rainfall data used for the British carry cost adjustment. Pauling et al. (2006) present
seasonal precipitation reconstructions for European land areas on a 0.5·0.5 resolved
grid between 1500 and 1900. We use the nearest data point to each county as the
county precipitation, and aggregate the seasonal data to get the total annual
precipitation. To make it comparable to the Chinese data, we normalize the British
data according to the above Chinese official methodology to a 1-5 scale
