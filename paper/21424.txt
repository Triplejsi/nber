Corporate Venture Capital as a Real Option in the Markets for Technology

ABSTRACT
Despite the fact that one of the main goals of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments in high-tech
industries is to gain a window on future technologies, the relationship between CVC investments and
strategies used to acquire technologies in the markets, such as licensing, has not been adequately
explored. To address this gap, we build on the real option literature suggesting that CVC investments
can be used as real options in the markets for technology. Accordingly, we formulate hypotheses
about key drivers of the option value of CVC investments and the decision to exercise the option.
Using a longitudinal dataset based on 604 dyads formed by a sample of global pharmaceutical firms
and their external technology partners, we find that corporate investors’ scientific capabilities,
technological domains, research pipelines, and the resolution of exogenous uncertainty related to
partner firms’ technologies impact investors’ decisions on CVC investments and ex post technology
acquisition. In our research setting, the most common way to exercise the option post-CVC investment
is via technology licensing.

INTRODUCTION
Increasingly firms utilize a number of mechanisms to reach out beyond their boundaries
in order to acquire technology. Increasingly, companies have utilized one such mechanism,
corporate venture capital (CVC), as a means of identifying early-stage research (e.g., Dushnitsky,
2006). Extant work has explicitly examined CVC investments as a window for future technology
(e.g., Gompers and Lerner, 1998; Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2005a, 2005b, and 2006; Wadhwa and
Kotha, 2006; Keil et al., 2008; Benson and Ziedonis, 2009; Basu et al., 2011) with several
surveys supporting this motivation (e.g., PricewaterhouseCooper, 2006; Corporate Strategy
Board, 2000). More recently, PricewaterhouseCooper (2014) reported that 95% of respondents
indicated that the “windows for future technologies or markets” was of “high or medium
importance” when considering strategic motivations for CVC investments.
For corporate investors, CVC investments allow them to make limited risk investments in
early-stage companies and gather information about new technologies over time (Arora and
Gambardella, 1990; Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2005a). For example, in our research setting, the
pharmaceutical industry, the stated investment purpose of several CVC investment programs
include: “…direct investments in early-stage innovative life science companies that demonstrate
promise to deliver breakthrough products that may be future Sanofi pipeline candidates…” or
“…focus areas include therapeutic areas complimentary to those of Baxter’s existing medical
product or bioscience businesses as well as cutting edge technologies outside Baxter’s current
product portfolio…”; “Companies with innovative new technologies…”; and, “…as well as
emerging or more opportunistic area of innovation that have the potential to complement
AbbVie’s existing portfolio or to expand Abbvie’s future business reach.”1 This emphasis on
future technologies as a primary motivation was confirmed through interviews with multiple

leading global pharmaceutical companies.2
A growing body of literature considers what firms do with this newly acquired
information and how these investments relate to other external R&D strategies. For example,
firms may make CVC investments as a precursor to an eventual vertical acquisition (e.g., Arora
and Gambardella, 1990; Folta, 1998; Folta and Miller, 2002; Vassolo et al., 2004; Villalonga and
McGahan, 2005; Benson and Ziedonis, 2009 and 2010; Tong and Li, 2010). In this instance,
information gathered after an investment may lead to better target firm selection. Additionally, it
may also act as a monitoring mechanism for the progress of the underlying technology (Bottazzi
et al., 2004), providing information on when to acquire a target (Arora and Gambardella, 1990).
A major gap in the literature is the analysis of the relationship between CVC and
technology licensing, the most common contract-based mechanism utilized to acquire existing or
ex post technology (e.g., Arora and Gambardella, 2010). This is surprising considering that one
of the main goals of CVC investments is to gain a ‘window on future technology’. Indeed, CVC
investors have the future option to license from versus acquiring the portfolio firm; licensing
confers the benefits of intellectual property rights (IPR) transfer without having to suffer the
transaction or integration costs (which can be significant) of an acquisition.
As such, we use real option (RO) theory within a two-stage framework to analyze the
conditions under which pharmaceutical companies make CVC investments as a strategy to defer
technology purchase decisions characterized by greater levels of commitment and irreversibility
(e.g., R&D alliances, licensing, and acquisitions). Then, conditional on having chosen to make a
CVC investment, we explore conditions under which these corporate investors may choose to
2

We are not suggesting that the windows for future technology is the only motivation for making CVC investments,
however in our research setting it is the primary reason. Other motivations exist, for example: (1) in order to drive
ecosystem adoption of company technologies; (2) provide existing businesses with commercial opportunities; and (3)
for pure financial returns. It is clear to us, however, from our conversations with companies, review of leading CVC
programs, and analysis of actual CVC contracts that the primary motivation is the window for future technologies.

“exercise” their ROs by acquiring the technology. In Figure 1 we draw our two-stage framework,
conditional on entering the external technology market and map the relevant literatures to this
framework. Our paper is the first to explore CVC investments in such a multi-stage framework
and relative to a more complete and realistic set of strategic choices firms face.
More specifically, we start by suggesting that a firm’s ability to select external
technology, a component of their absorptive capacity, is a key driver of option value. In
particular, we argue that firms with weak scientific capabilities or technological knowledge that
is not closely related to the focal external technology are more likely to make a CVC investment
relative to an ex post technology acquisition. These firms are less capable in selecting external
technologies, thus unable to mitigate technological uncertainty thereby driving up the option
value of a CVC investment relative to ex post technology acquisition strategies.
Next, we demonstrate that firms possessing a relatively greater proportion of early-stage
technologies in their pipelines are less likely to make CVC investments, relative to directly
engaging in ex post technology purchases through licensing or acquisition. Consistent with a
ROs perspective, we argue that firms that are in greater need for late-stage innovations face a
more limited timeframe upon which to exercise a CVC option. Any decrease in the time from
investment to potential exercise will decrease the RO value of such an investment.
We use a ROs perspective to address the issue of what corporate investors ultimately do
with their CVC investments. We argue that conditional upon making CVC investments,
corporate investors are more likely to engage in ex post technology transactions with their
partner firms when the value of focal technology is high and the associated uncertainty is low. In
other words, CVC investments as ROs are more likely to be exercised when these two conditions
(i.e., high technology value and low uncertainty) are appropriately interacted. We also

3

demonstrate, for the first time, that, in a context whereby future technology acquisition is a major
strategic CVC objective, licensing is the most likely exercise strategy (choice) that firms utilize,
filling a major gap in the CVC literature (see Figure 1).
Finally, motivated by interviews with industry practitioners we expand the set of minority
equity investments that we include under the rubric of ‘CVC investments’. While some limit the
rubric solely to minority equity investments in small, private firms we also include minority
investments in small, public firms. Limiting our analysis solely to private firms excludes
investments that in reality practitioners are making for the same underlying motivation. This is
an industry whose product development cycle extends beyond a decade. In both cases, these
remain investments in small, research-focused firms with nascent technologies and high levels of
uncertainty regarding their eventual success. Our core results remain qualitatively consistent
between this broader definition of CVC and a more traditional one focused only on private firms.
RELATED LITERATURE
CVC investments as a window for future technology
Our theory builds on two different research streams. First is the literature on markets for
technology (MFT). CVC investments can help corporate investors identify future technology
partners by reducing asymmetric information and uncertainty that may characterize MFT. This
reduction in risk eventually provides clarity to the corporate investor and they may then choose
to license the portfolio technology or acquire the portfolio firm. It is possible that an initial CVC
investment can lead to an R&D alliance (Maula et al., 2013). Finally, corporate investors may
choose not to engage in a subsequent activity (i.e., license, acquisition or R&D alliance) in which
case they can try to sell the portfolio investment or hold it passively.
Reflecting back on Figure 1, these options are described on the second branch (2.E:
license; 2.F: acquisition; 2.G: R&D alliance; and, 2.H: hold in portfolio). A major contribution of
4

this paper is the inclusion of licensing (2.E) as a post-CVC investment option. No other paper
identified in Figure 1, or that we are aware of, currently considers licensing in this second stage
or relative to these other options.3 In our research setting, licensing is the most popular form of
option execution.
The importance of licensing as a technology acquisition strategy should not be surprising.
There exists significant work in the MFT literature extolling the benefits of licensing.4 Licensing
enables gains from trade, providing technology suppliers access to downstream capabilities of
buyers, to be balanced against transaction costs associated with contracting. Strong IPR are a key
facilitating factor of technology transactions between suppliers holding the IPR and buyers
possessing specialized complementary assets (Arora and Ceccagnoli, 2006). Effective patent
protection is an important driving factor of the diffusion of licensing in industries such as
biopharmaceuticals, where the propensity to patent is high (Cohen et al. 2000).
Acquisition is another strategy involving a high degree of organizational integration
between technology suppliers and holders of downstream complementary capabilities (Arora and
Gambardella, 1990; Kale and Puranam, 2004). Acquisitions imply the transfer of technology
ownership rights across firm boundaries through equity-based, rather than contractual,
mechanisms. While acquisitions facilitate the transfer of human capital and its productivity, the
achievement of synergies is typically offset by implementation problems and integration costs
(e.g., Graebner et al., 2010). The net benefits of acquisition in term of innovation are often
questionable. On the other hand, licensing is an arm’s length contractual alternative that allows
the acquisition of specific technologies, avoids integration costs, and may complement the
3

The closest paper to considering multiple post-CVC investment options is Van de Vrande and Vanhaverbeke
(2008). They consider acquisitions (2.F), R&D alliances (2.G) and hold in portfolio (2.H). Not only do they exclude
licensing (2.E) but their study is conditional on a CVC investment occurring. That is, they focus on the second-stage
investment choice we depict in Stage 2 of Figure 1.

internal R&D of the technology acquirer under certain conditions (Ceccagnoli et al., 2014).
CVC as real options
The second research stream is the growing literature relating CVC to ROs (e.g., Folta,
1998; Folta and Miller, 2002; Vassolo et al., 2004; Van de Vrande et al., 2006; Van de Vrande
and Vanhaverbeke, 2009; Li and Mahoney, 2011). ROs are sequential investments in real assets
made under conditions of uncertainty that create potential opportunities for more significant
investments at some future date. They require ex ante criteria for deferral, exercise, and
abandonment but provide ex post flexibility for an investor to act in response to new information
that may affect the value of the underlying asset (Seth and Chi, 2005).
In general, CVC investments can be viewed as ROs as they constitute relatively small
investments in novel and uncertain technologies (Allen and Hevert, 2007; Tong and Li, 2010).
CVC investments are analogous to call options, giving the corporate investor the right but not the
obligation to defer more formal commitments (Higgins, 2007). CVC investments also provide
corporate investors with privileged information about a venture (Tong and Li, 2010; Dushnitsky,
2006). This flow of information may reduce investor uncertainty and lead to “exercise” of the
RO (Folta and Miller, 2002).
The general applicability of ROs theory to management decisions has been robustly
debated, especially in the context of R&D investments (e.g., McGrath, 1997; Folta, 1998; Adner
and Levinthal, 2004a and 2004b; McGrath et al., 2004). At the heart of this debate are
endogenous firm actions that might possibly influence option value (Gil, 2007). For example,
Adner and Levinthal (2004a and 2004b) (hereafter, A&L(a) and A&L(b)), argue that endogenous
actions can lead to an open ended investment which may possibly influence its timely
abandonment; a key feature, they argue, of limiting downside risk and applicability of ROs.
In the aforementioned debate, A&L(a) lay out boundary conditions for the appropriate
6

use of ROs theory. Within a two-by-two matrix they relate the irreversibility of an investment to
its degree of uncertainty, arguing that ROs are applicable across ranges of moderate to high
levels of uncertainty and moderate to high levels of irreversibility. As both of these factors
increase, the value of the underlying option increases (Folta et al., 2006).
In general, investments in early-stage technology occur in highly uncertain environments
and are associated with a high degree of sunkness or irreversibility. This is exacerbated if a firm
also has to make investments in co-specialized assets that are highly irreversible (Santoro and
McGill, 2005). In our setting, this increase in option value is analogous to an increase in the
value of an option to defer a more formal commitment thereby increasing the likelihood of CVC.
As such, these features of early-stage R&D investing – high uncertainty and irreversibility – fit
solidly within the first boundary condition put forth by A&L (2004a: Figure 2a) thereby making
the option to defer a more formal commitment via a CVC investment valuable.
A&L describe a second boundary condition that distinguishes ROs from path-dependent
opportunities. Again, in a two-by-two matrix (A&L, 2004a, Figure 2b), they relate the flexibility
of the target market with the flexibility of the underlying technical agenda. They argue that as
one moves from fixed to more flexibility along these dimensions the applicability of ROs
diminishes and the underlying investments become more path-dependent. In our setting, both of
these dimensions are each more fixed than flexible, well within the boundary specified by A&L
(2004a; Figure 2b).5
The example in footnote five along with similar observations in our data are corroborated
by interviews with senior executives from leading pharmaceutical companies along with our
5

For example, in 2008 GlaxoSmithKline made a venture capital investment in a small biotech company whose
singular focus was on microRNA-targeted therapeutics to treat Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis. Both the
target market and technical agendas are predominantly fixed and well defined, even though the viability of the
underlying technology is still highly uncertain. This example is consistent with the types of deals we observe in our
data.
7

analysis of CVC investment contracts. Consistent with prior work (e.g., Ernst and Young, 2008;
Dushnitsky, 2006), these conversations describe highly specialized and formal organizational
units responsible for CVC investments with many of the key personnel having backgrounds in
venture capital. Moreover, these investment programs are highly professional (Ernst and Young,
2008) and follow the same types of rigorous investment criteria used by independent VCs. All of
our interviewees described ex ante investment processes that included expected performance
milestones, the conditions under which they would abandon an investment and what possible
“exercise” options they would consider. These discussions were consistent with the types of
processes described in the literature (e.g., evaluating exits (Basu et al., 2011) and abandoning
investments (Chemmanur et al., 2014)).
How uncertainty is resolved during the investment period is also important for the
applicability of ROs theory. By definition uncertainty is positively related to the variance of an
underlying asset; greater variance increases an option’s value. For financial options the variance
is reflected in and calculated from historical equity prices. However, in the case of ROs, variance
is due to uncertainty in the underlying real asset. With our focus on early-stage R&D investments,
uncertainty derives from such factors as: the age of the firm, maturity of the technology, the
development stage and/or technological distance of the underlying technology from the investor.
The ROs literature has categorized uncertainty into two types, exogenous and
endogenous, which may be resolved during the option period (e.g., Folta, 1998; Gil, 2007;
Ziedonis, 2007). These types of uncertainty are distinguished from one another based on whether
resolution is independent of the actions of the corporate investor. In the case of exogenous
uncertainty it may resolve itself over the option period independent of corporate investor action
(Folta, 1998). For example, Ziedonis (2007) describes an example where a firm weighs an

8

investment decision in the face of pending legislation that it is unable to influence but will
nevertheless affect its returns. In this instance, uncertainty relating to the legislation is unaffected
by the firm’s decision to invest.
In a research setting similar to our own, Folta and Miller (2002) explore pharmaceutical
company acquisitions of biotechnology firms for which they hold a minority equity stake.
Viewed through the lens of RO theory, these firms hold an option on future acquisition.
Following Folta (1998), they measure exogenous uncertainty by volatility in sub-field stock
market returns, finding that when uncertainty is reduced, acquisitions (i.e., exercise of the option)
are more likely to occur.
Endogenous uncertainty, on the other hand, may resolve itself over the option period only
with active involvement by the corporate investor (Folta, 1998). If uncertainty is endogenously
resolved or as A&L(a) suggests, “…we move away from a world of ‘wait and see’ to a world of
‘act and see’…”, the application of ROs becomes strained. It is important to note that A&L(a) are
not arguing for strict exogenous resolution of uncertainty but rather leave open the possibility for
some measure of endogeneity before applicability collapses. That is they suggest “The greater
the extent to which these properties are violated, the more problematic the application of an
options framework is” (A&L, 2004a, pg.76).
Information gathered from our interviews and review of 100 CVC contracts indicates that
two things appear to be predominately occurring within the biopharmaceutical industry.6 First,
most of these CVC investments are indeed standoff financial investments in which case the
resolution of uncertainty is exogenous. That is, the corporate investor has no involvement with
the development of the underlying technology of the portfolio firm. Second, of the contracts we
reviewed less than 10% of them provided a board seat to the corporate investor. In some cases
6

Contracts were obtained from BiosciDB: https://www.bioscidb.com/.
9

these board seats were non-voting and observation only. Our interviews revealed that these seats
serve as a mechanism to transfer information back to the corporate investor (as opposed from the
corporate investor to the portfolio firm). This view is consistent with what other scholars have
documented about board seats (e.g., Dushnitsky, 2006).
Interestingly, Dushnitsky (2006, pg. 415) posed a question that we included in our
interviews: “Do firms leverage their skilled R&D personnel, manufacturing capabilities, or
industry outlook to assist portfolio companies?” Consistently we were told “no” unless there was
an additional research agreement that clearly delineated ownership of IPR. This added caution is
warranted, as this is an industry that is wholly dependent upon secure IPR. That said, our
interviewees did suggest that they would assist in such things as product strategy development or
the facilitation of business development relationships with their own firms. Neither of these areas,
however, directly involved the corporate investor working on the portfolio firm’s underlying
technology.
In our setting the resolution of uncertainty is therefore exogenous as these investments
are mainly standoff financial transactions. In the limited instances where there is interaction
between the firms it does not appear to rise to the “act-and-see” concerns of A&L(a). Certainly,
the involvement with the portfolio firms through CVC investing is far less than with a joint
venture (Reuer and Tong, 2005; Tong et al., 2008) or engaging in an R&D-focused strategic
alliance (Kogut, 1991; Smit and Trigeorgis, 2004; Vassolo et al., 2004) where the resolution of
uncertainty would be more endogenous.
HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT
In this section we integrate the ideas developed in the previous discussion within a
stylized model, which will allow us to better structure the development of our hypotheses. In
particular, we articulate our hypotheses using the decision tree illustrated in Figure 1.
10

While firms face an initial decision on whether to internally develop a technology or
enter the external markets to purchase it, we focus our analysis on the choice between alternative
external technology acquisition strategies. In other words, we analyze whether firms, conditional
on “outsourcing R&D”, should purchase ex post technology in the markets through a license or
an acquisition or, alternatively, make ex ante CVC investments. We also consider the option of
forming an R&D-focused alliance as a second form of ex ante technology acquisition. R&D
alliances can be viewed as a mechanism of investment in the generation of future technology
(Arora and Gambardella, 2010). However, as we will discuss, they also differ markedly from
CVC in terms of the overall resource commitment and involvement by the corporate investor.
In line with the logic developed in the previous section, the objective of our analysis on
the first stage is to examine the RO value of CVC once we recognize that alternative technology
strategies requiring greater resource commitment are available. The second stage allows us to
analyze the conditions favoring the exercise of the RO. At this stage, conditional on the choice of
CVC, corporate investors can choose to engage in ex post technology acquisition, such as
licensing or acquisition, form an R&D-focused alliance, continue to hold the partner firm in their
CVC portfolio, or liquidate. Our focus is on the decision to acquire ex post technology.
Figure 2 summarizes differences between the analyzed external R&D strategies along the
key dimensions discussed so far that are relevant to our framework. While the distinction
between CVC and acquisition based on irreversibility and commitment are stronger, differences
between CVC and licensing merit further discussion. As pointed out above, CVC investments
tend to be mostly standoff financial transactions. In many larger firms, CVC programs have their
own staff that select and execute investments. R&D personnel may be consulted on target
selection and corporate assets, such as legal, may also be utilized. In the case of licensing deals,

11

similar corporate resources may be utilized for target selection and execution. However, R&D
personnel actively use the licensed technology. Thus, from an asset perspective, we would expect
licensing to require a larger human capital commitment than CVC investments.
In terms of financial commitment between these two types of strategies, we indeed see
that licensing deals require greater financial commitments. For example, the mean CVC
investment (across all rounds) in our data is $10.75 million whereas the mean license is $36.54
million. The average Round A CVC investment has a mean value of $4.46 million and Round B
has a mean value of $8.18 million. In sum, both the human capital commitment (and one can
reasonably assume, that cost) and actual financial commitment of licensing exceeds that of a
CVC investment. Within our typology of ex ante and ex post technology acquisition, this should
not be surprising; CVC investments are an ex ante technology acquisition mechanism whereas
licensing is an ex post mechanism. As such, developed technologies should carry a larger value.
Licensing and acquisitions are placed on separate branches in our decision tree model.
However, we group them together, conceptually, in the second stage because they are commonly
employed to purchase technology ex post and imply a greater degree of irreversibility and
commitment relative to the ex ante CVC investment. In other words, the application of a RO
framework to CVC decisions whose main objective is to acquire technology justifies the
grouping ex post in term of option exercise. Licensing has advantages over acquisitions when the
investor is interested in a specific technology and avoids potential integration costs. However,
this option is not always available because many start-ups are ultimately aiming to be acquired or
because technologies cannot always be separated from a partner firms’ human and organizational
resources and capabilities. As such, acquisitions may be a more viable (or only) option for
investors in some circumstances.

12

To summarize, the logic of our approach is that conditional on entering the external
technology markets, the first decision a firm (corporate investor) will face is whether to purchase
an ex ante or ex post technology. If the decision is to purchase an ex ante technology through a
purchase of an option via a CVC in the first stage, then the firm needs to decide whether to
exercise the option by purchasing the technology ex post, either through a license or an
acquisition. Understanding the factors underlying the choice between licensing and acquisition in
the second stage, while important, goes beyond the scope of this study.7
Uncertainty and absorptive capacity
The extant literature widely recognizes that a firm’s capacity to be innovative through
external R&D activities is greatly determined by its internal competency in identifying and
integrating appropriate external technologies or know-how. This competency or “absorptive
capacity” (AC) (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989 and 1990) stresses the importance of a firm’s stock
of prior knowledge to effectively identify, evaluate, integrate, and commercialize external
technologies (e.g., Arora and Gambardella, 1990 and 1994; Cockburn and Henderson, 1998;
Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2005b; Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006).
In the MFT literature, there is substantial evidence highlighting the key role of AC,
typically measured using a firm’s R&D expenditure and its stock of patents, on driving
technology purchase decisions. The key mechanism is through complementarity between
external and internal R&D; with internal R&D activities found to increase the marginal returns
from a variety of external R&D activities. For example, Gambardella (1992) and Veugelers
(1997) report that external sourcing of R&D is more effective when done in conjunction with
7

For completeness we also allow for the formation of an R&D-based alliance in the second stage. This would
suggest that the corporate investor is still pursuing an ex ante technology. That is, the underlying portfolio
technology has not been completely developed and now the corporate investor is formally committing R&D
resources to the project. Theoretically, we would expect a third-stage where the corporate investor would finally
acquire the ex post technology either via licensing or acquisition. It is important to note that while we leave the
R&D-based alliance as an option in the second-stage, the primary choice we see is that of licensing.
13

internal R&D. Ceccagnoli et al. (2014) find that strong scientific capabilities increase
complementarity between internal R&D and in-licensing investments.
Consistent with the MFT literature, the CVC/strategy literature suggests that strong AC
increases CVC activity (Basu et al., 2011). Two studies qualify this idea by showing that the
complementarity between a firm’s CVC and internal R&D activity depends on its internal
knowledge base (Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2005b; Wadhwa and Kotha, 2006). A third study,
Benson and Ziedonis (2009), shows that internal R&D and CVC investments tend to be
complementary by jointly increasing the performance of acquisitions of entrepreneurial startups
in the IT sector.
None of these previous studies, however, examines the role of AC on the option value of
CVC as a way to defer an investment in ex post technology acquisition through market
mechanisms that include technology licensing. A key mechanism through which AC affects the
option value of CVC is represented by the effect of upstream scientific capabilities on the
selection of external technologies (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Arora and Gambardella, 1994;
Ziedonis, 2007). In particular, Arora and Gambardella (1994) distinguish two components of
absorptive capacity that are relevant to the acquisition of external technology. One component is
the ability to evaluate external technology, which depends on a firm’s upstream research
capability. Another component is a firm’s ability to utilize external technologies, which depends
on its technological and development skills. Most work in the absorptive capacity literature has
focused on the ability to integrate external knowledge, which has been defined in the
management literature as “realized absorptive capacity” (Zahra and George, 2002). Less work
has instead focused on “potential absorptive capacity”, the capability to assess broad external
technological information (Zahra and George, 2002).

14

Such distinction has important implications for our analysis. For example, Arora and
Gambardella (1994) suggest that firms with stronger scientific capabilities have greater ability to
evaluate external technology, are more selective, and focus on fewer but more valuable external
technologies (e.g., “…receive signals about the future value of the technology that are less
‘noisy’…”, Arora and Gambardella, 1994). Ziedonis (2007) applies a similar logic to explain an
early-stage technology acquisition strategy in the context of university licensing, by showing that
that firms better able to evaluate these technologies are less likely to purchase option contracts
prior to in-licensing the technology from a university.
In our setting, the distinction between ability to evaluate and effectively utilize external
technology suggests that firms possessing lower levels of scientific capabilities will face higher
levels of technological uncertainty, thus perceiving a greater option value of CVC relative to
alternative ex post technology acquisition options, such as licensing or acquisition.
Hypothesis 1a. Firms possessing weaker scientific capabilities are more likely to make CVC
investments relative to engaging in ex post technology transactions such as licensing or
acquisitions.
A similar logic can be applied to purchase decisions in novel technological domains. A
firm lacking related technological expertise in a particular area will find it more difficult to more
effectively evaluate the importance of a focal technology for future technological advances and
potential commercial applications. As pointed out by Cohen and Levinthal (1990: pp. 135-136):
“…The possession of related expertise will permit the firm to better understand and therefore evaluate the import
of intermediate technological advances that provide signals as to the eventual merit of a new technological
development. Thus, in an uncertain environment, absorptive capacity affects expectation formation, permitting
the firm to predict more accurately the nature and commercial potential of technological advances.”

Building on these ideas, Lane and Lubatkin (1998) argue that a firm’s ability to recognize and
value new external knowledge is largely determined by a firm’s relative absorptive capacity, a
learning dyad-level construct based on the distance between the knowledge base of recipient and

15

contributing organizations.
Based on the above arguments, we suggest that a lack of related knowledge will decrease
the ability to predict more accurately and will therefore increase uncertainty associated with
investments in external technologies. As such, firms with an internal knowledge base that is
unrelated to the focal technology will assess a higher option value for CVC investments relative
to ex post technology acquisition.8 We therefore hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 1b. Firms accessing distant technologies are more likely to make CVC
investments relative to engaging in ex post technology transactions such as licensing or
acquisitions.
Time to option exercise and the corporate investors’ technology portfolio
In industries where innovation is critical to gain a competitive advantage, the
composition of a firm’s late-stage innovation portfolio is a key variable that affects its decision to
acquire external technologies (Higgins and Rodriguez, 2006). We now consider how a firm’s
early-stage innovation portfolio influences the option value of CVC investments. We argue that
firms possessing portfolios composed largely of early-stage technologies will be more likely to
engage in ex post technology transactions relative to CVC investments, because they have a
more immediate technological need.
Ex post technologies that can be obtained via license or acquisition will be more
effective than nascent technologies in improving current productivity and filling any potential
8

The logic underlying HP1b differs from that recently used by Van de Vrande and Vanhaverbeke (2013), who suggest that
technological relatedness between a CVC investor and its portfolio firm increases the likelihood of subsequent knowledge
sourcing through an R&D alliance. While we share with the above study a RO framework and features of the empirical setting,
we differ significantly in our hypothesis and empirical results. In particular, they study the role of CVC as a way to defer an
investment whose objective is to acquire knowledge through an R&D alliance, while we focus on ex post technology acquisition
investments. Second, they focus on the second stage of our RO framework, that is on factors driving the decision to exercise the
option via an R&D alliance, while we adopt a more holistic approach by studying both purchase and exercise stages of the option
framework (see Figure 1). Third, they hypothesize and find that increases in technological overlap between investor and portfolio
firm, are associated with a higher probability that the CVC investor will exercise the option by making an R&D alliance with the
portfolio firm. Since post-CVC the potential technology partner has been selected, the effect of technological overlap between
CVC investor and portfolio firm captures the role of absorptive capacity in reducing technological uncertainty through a more
effective utilization of the external knowledge contributed by the portfolio firm (‘the realized absorptive capacity”) post-CVC.
We instead analyze the negative effect of technological relatedness (through the role of “potential absorptive capacity”) on the
value of the option (Stage 1, Figure 1), rather than the positive effect on its exercise (Stage 2, Figure 1).

late-stage pipeline (Chan et al., 2007; Danzon et al., 2007). In other words, a firm’s need for
later-stage technologies will decrease the ex ante value of a RO, or in this case, a CVC
investment. This decrease in value is caused by a reduction in the time (Higgins, 2007) available
between CVC investment and the potential need to exercise the RO. Essentially, firms do not
have time to wait.
In contrast, firms possessing portfolios with a greater proportion of later-stage
technologies can afford to be less concerned with current productivity and can turn their
attention towards future productivity. In this situation, firms have the freedom to focus on and
shift resources to nurturing nascent technologies that could potentially be used in the future. A
longer time period between investment and potential exercise will increase the value of a RO
(Higgins, 2007). We therefore formulate the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2. Firms possessing a smaller proportion of early-stage technologies are more
likely to make CVC investments relative to engaging in ex post technology transactions, such
as licensing or acquisitions.
Resolution of exogenous uncertainty and option exercise post-CVC
Once a CVC investment is made corporate investors face two future decisions. First, they
can integrate the technology by ‘exercising the option’ via an ex post technology transaction. The
investment can also remain in the investor’s portfolio.9 Consistent with our discussions above,
however, investments will not remain in a portfolio indefinitely. If an investment is not pursued,
a firm can either sell the investment or hold it until a liquidation event occurs. There is also the
risk that the partner firm could go bankrupt or be acquired.
Ultimately, the decision to exercise an option via an ex post technology transaction will
be dependent upon the resolution of uncertainty (Folta and Miller, 2002). With the passage of
time the corporate investor continues to learn about the underlying technology while at the same

For robustness, we also include R&D alliances as a post-CVC option.
17

time the partner firm continues their research. As exogenous uncertainty begins to dissipate
around a technology its underlying value begins to increase. Conditional on a corporate investor
entering the external technology market, the portfolio firm’s focal technology will be considered
if the value of that technology is high and the uncertainty associated with realizing that value is
low (Folta and Miller, 2002). Put differently, the interaction effect between technological
uncertainty and the value associated with the technology of the portfolio firm on the probability
that the corporate investor exercises the option is negative. As such, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 3. A reduction in exogenous uncertainty associated with the technology of a
portfolio firm and an increase in its value will increase the probability that CVC investors
will engage in ex post technology transactions such as licensing or acquisitions with their
portfolio companies
EMPIRICAL METHOD AND DATA
Method
We utilize a variety of empirical approaches using a longitudinal dataset of
pharmaceutical firms where the unit of analysis is the corporate investor-partner (portfolio firm)
dyad. The sample and analysis is divided into the two corresponding distinct stages in the
sequence of events outlined in Figure 1.
Stage 1: The option value of CVC
In the first stage, we examine the time until the occurrence of the first CVC investment
by the corporate investor in the partner firm. The time series of each dyad starts from the time of
incorporation of the corporate investor and it is broken into one-year spells. This allows for the
incorporation of time-varying covariates. Each yearly spell is treated as right censored, unless we
observe a CVC investment or a competing event. This analysis allows us to test hypotheses on
the determinants of the option value of CVC investments within a menu of strategic alternatives
(e.g., Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 2).
The hazard of a CVC is modeled using the semi-parametric Cox competing risk
18

specification (Fine and Gray, 1999), where the dependent variable is time until the occurrence of
the first CVC investment by the corporate investor in the focal partner. The key feature of this
model, also known as a proportional subhazards model, is that the hazard of a CVC investment
depends on the corporate investor not having previously adopted alternative technology
acquisition strategies. We consider a broad set of competing risks that include licensing, majority
ownership acquisitions, and R&D-focused alliances.10
In this setup, there are multiple latent durations (corresponding to the multiple strategic
alternatives) that are governed by the subhazards. The observed duration for any specific dyadyear is the minimum value between these alternative durations. The occurrence of a competing
event other than a CVC investment does not necessarily exclude the dyad from the risk set, but it
does fundamentally alter the probability of a CVC tie from occurring. More formally, the
subhazards for event j, dyad i, at time t is:

can be interpreted as the probability of

observing an event of interest j (i.e., CVC investment) in the next time interval while knowing
that either the event of interest did not happen until then or that a competing event was not
observed (Pintilie, 2006).
Stage 2: Exercising the option post-CVC investments
In order to provide convincing empirical support for the applicability of a ROs theory to
the analysis of CVC investments, we evaluate whether the resolution of exogenous uncertainty

10

We used stcrreg command in Stata 13 to estimate the model (cf. www.stata.com/manuals13/ststcrreg.pdf). Note
that there are observations (within a dyad) where CVC and competing events occur in the same year. This is an issue
of tied first failures of competing events. We followed the convention (as described in the Stata manuals) and treat
each tied event as the first event but weighted by the reciprocal of the number of tied events, with standard errors
clustered by dyads taking into account of the correlation across observations.

leads corporate investors to “exercise” the option by acquiring the focal partner’s technology.
Therefore, we examine the time to the occurrence of an ex post technology transaction between
the corporate investor and partner firm starting from the year of the first CVC investment. As for
the first stage, each yearly spell is treated as right censored, unless we observe a license or an
acquisition after the first CVC investment.11 Finally, for reasons we will discuss, we will refer to
licensing as the predominant technology acquisition strategy.
Data
The sample consists of 604 investor-external technology partner dyads involving 58
publicly-traded pharmaceutical companies that established external technology deals between
1985 and 2007. The pharmaceutical firms in our sample constitute approximately 90% of
branded pharmaceutical sales in the U.S. in 2007. This time period saw significant expansion in
external R&D activities in this industry (e.g., MacMillan et al., 2008). Corporate investors were
selected if they had at least one CVC investment during the study period in the Deloitte ReCap
database (ReCap), our primary data source. ReCap tracks the entire lifecycle of biotechnology
partner firm financing from founding through final disposition. To finalize the sample of
investors, we selected those CVC investors with active internal R&D during the sample period.
R&D and other financial information was obtained from Compustat.
Once the set of CVC investors was selected, we identified all CVC investments, inlicensing deals, acquisitions, and R&D-focused strategic alliances involving the corporate
investors in the ReCap database. We then identified the partners of the selected technology deals
and formed investor-partner dyads, starting from the year of incorporation of the investor. Each
dyadic relationship presents at least one type of external R&D during the study period (but not
necessarily a CVC investment) and our analysis is conditioned on investors conducting both

R&D-focused alliances are also considered for robustness purposes.

internal and external R&D during the study period.
As mentioned earlier, the partner/portfolio firms from the ReCap database can be either
public or private biotechnology companies and the public status can change during the time
period examined. All models include a control for public status. We also estimated our
benchmark results using only private partners (see Appendix A5). The conclusions presented in
this paper remain robust to the exclusion of public partners from the set of firms at-risk of
obtaining CVC financing in any given year.
For each of our corporate investors and partner firms we reconstruct their drug pipelines
using data from PharmaProjects.12 Next, in order to build measures of technology relatedness we
utilize patent data from NBER to construct patent stocks and classes for each investor and
partner.13 Finally, scientific publication data was gathered from Web of Science. Descriptive
statistics, variable definitions and their sources are presented in Table 1. All financial variables
are in constant 2007 dollars.
Dependent variables: Sub-hazards of CVC and License or Acquisition post-CVC.
For stage 1 of our analysis, the duration variable is the Sub-hazard of CVC, which is
based on the time until the occurrence of the first CVC investment conditional on the corporate
investor not having previously adopted alternative technology acquisition strategies, such as
licensing, R&D alliance, or acquisition. For stage 2 of our analysis the duration variable is the
Sub-hazard of License or Acquisition post-CVC, defined based on the time until the occurrence
of the first License or Acquisition post-CVC, conditional on the corporate investor not having

previously established an R&D alliance with the focal partner. For more details on the
construction of this variable, see the related description in Table 1.
Key independent variables
Investor’s scientific capability. Several different measures of absorptive capacity have
been proposed in the literature. The most widely used, partly due to its availability, is R&D
intensity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989 and 1990). Additionally, Arora and Gambardella (1994)
argue that a firm’s basic research capability is particularly effective in capturing its ability to
evaluate and select external knowledge.14 Measures of upstream research capabilities have also
been shown to be key drivers of potential complementarity between a firm’s internal and external
R&D activities (Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006). For example, in constructing their measure of
absorptive capacity, Cassiman and Veugelers rely on survey responses indicating the importance,
for the innovation process, of information from research institutes and universities.
Similarly, scholars have measured a firm’s ability to select and evaluate external
knowledge using measures of human capital, including the number of R&D employees with a
doctorate degree (Veugelers, 1997) or the number of scientific publications authored by firm
employees (Arora and Gambardella, 1994; Cockburn and Henderson, 1998; Ceccagnoli et al.,
2014). Following this literature, we use the ratio of the number of scientific papers published by
corporate investor employees (scaled to one thousand) to the number of employees to estimate
the investor’s scientific capability.
Investor-partner technological distance. Prior work has demonstrated the importance of
corporate investor-partner technological distance (or overlap) on external R&D decisions, such

14

Arora and Gambardella (1994) argue: “Scientific capability enables the firm to reduce the uncertainty about the
outcome of individual projects…. It has been argued that science provides information that helps restrict the search
for successful innovations at the downstream applied research and development stages. … Since a great deal of
useful information in biotechnology is science based, an in-house scientific capability is crucial for evaluating and
assessing information originating outside of the firm’s boundaries.”
22

as, acquisition (Ahuja and Katila, 2001) and strategic alliances (Mowery et al., 1996). As such,
we measure whether or not the technological areas covered by the partner firm are new for the
corporate investor. Using the 3-digit patent classifications listed on each firm’s patents (e.g.,
Ahuja, 2000), we create an indicator variable that equals one if a partner firm has a patent in
areas that are new to the corporate investor, and zero otherwise. Measures computed on samples
with few patents or those limited to a single patent class can generate both biased and imprecise
measures of technological distance (Benner and Waldfogel, 2008). In order to avoid this potential
pitfall we use all patents obtained by the corporate investors and partner firms; we also use all 3digit technological classes listed in each patent.
Investor’s early-stage technology. Since we analyze an industry whose revenue stream is
dependent upon the flow of new products, we use drug pipeline data to measure the proportion of
early-stage technologies of a corporate investor. Within a corporate investor’s research pipeline
we count the number of drugs in the early-stages of development (i.e., preclinical and Phase 1).
We then divide this by the sum of their total number of drugs in all stages of development (i.e.,
preclinical and Phase 1-3). A larger value indicates that a corporate investor has a greater
proportion of early-stage technologies, while a smaller value indicates they have a portfolio more
heavily weighted towards later-stage technologies. These weightings are important because prior
research has demonstrated that gaps within a firm’s research pipeline may cause them to consider
entering the external technological markets (e.g., Chan et al. 2007; Danzon et al., 2007).
Value of partner’s technologies. We proxy for the value of a partner firm’s technology
using the number of drugs within a partner firm’s research pipeline (i.e., preclinical, Phase 1-3)
that are considered novel in terms of whether drugs with the same therapeutic area/mechanism(s)
have already been approved (or have a more advanced development stage). The novelty score for

23

each drug is assigned by PharmaProjects. We consider a drug novel if it is classified as being the
1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th compounds in a certain therapeutic class (Abrantes-Metz et al., 2003).
Volatility of technical subfields. There are substantial differences in the likelihood of
commercialization and development time horizons across technological subfields (i.e.,
therapeutic categories) in the pharmaceutical industry. Technological uncertainty will thus serve
as a proxy for exogenous uncertainty specific to technological subfields. In the same spirit as
Folta (1998), we use the volatility of these technological subfields to estimate technological
uncertainty. Using data from Pharmaprojects, we first create technological subfields and
calculate the 52-week volatility (i.e., standard deviation) of stock trading volume of public
companies that operate in each subfield using data from Compustat. Second, we calculate the
average volatilities in each subfield-year group. Finally, in order to estimate technological
uncertainty, each focal partner firm is matched into one of these subfield-year groups.
Control variables: Corporate investor
Investor’s pipeline. The scale of a corporate investor R&D pipeline may affect R&D
productivity and its external orientation. We measure the scale of a corporate investor’s
development activity by the total number of drugs within its research pipeline.
Investor’s employees. A firm’s commercialization capability can impact the probability of
finding external technology partners. We measure firm size by the number of employees.
Investor’s slack. Financial slack, defined as the availability of funds in order to take
advantage of profitable investment opportunities, may also impact a firm’s external R&D activity.
The pecking order theory of finance suggests that firms tend to use internally generated funds in
the form of retained earnings before turning to external sources. Following Geiger and Cashen
(2002), financial slack is estimated using retained earnings.
Investor’s patents. Prior research has demonstrated a significant relationship between a
24

firm’s technological capabilities and its external R&D activities (Arora and Gambardella, 1994).
We control for a corporate investor’s technological capabilities by its stock of successful patent
applications, depreciated by 15% annually (Hall et al., 2005).
Investor’s prior CVC experience & Investor’s prior external R&D experience. Firms with
experience in certain types of external R&D activity are likely to continue to re-engage in the
same type of activity because of learning effects. To control for this possible path dependency we
create two indicator variables to capture these prior activities. First, we define Investor’s prior
CVC experience as an indicator equal to one if a corporate investor has previously made a CVC
investment in another technology firm, zero otherwise. Second, we define Investor’s prior
external R&D experience as an indicator equal to one if a corporate investor has previously
engaged in an acquisition or license, zero otherwise.15
Control variables: Partner firm
Partner’s pipeline. We control for both the size and stage of a partner’s pipeline since
both could impact a corporate investor’s external R&D decision. To control for size we define
Partner’s pipeline as a count of the number of drugs in clinical development. In order to control
for the stage of the pipeline we define Partner’s pipeline stage as a count of the number of drugs
in the early-stages of development (i.e., preclinical and Phase 1) and divide by the number of
drugs in all stages of development (i.e., preclinical, Phase 1-3).
Partner VC funding. A corporate investor may be more interested in the success of an
underlying technology/project versus the longer-term success of a start-up compared to an
independent venture capitalist (Katila et al., 2008). Given this potential conflict, independent
venture capitalists can play a gatekeeper role to potentially protect a start-up’s interests with

15

Results, unreported, remain qualitatively robust to the inclusion of an additional control for the investor’s prior
experience with R&D-focused alliances.
25

corporate investors. To control for this possible effect we define an indicator variable, Partner
VC funding, that equals one if a partner firm received independent venture capital funding, zero
otherwise. Additionally, it may be the amount of previous funding raised by a partner firm that
matters. For example, prior research has demonstrated a positive relationship between the
amount of venture capital funding and the market value of entrepreneurial firms (Gompers and
Lerner, 2006.). To control for these potential effects we define Partner’s amount of funding
received as the cumulative funding raised by a partner firm from venture capitalists.
Partner’s age. Uncertainty regarding the commercial potential of technologies pursued by
a partner may affect the corporate investor’s ROs choice (Ziedonis, 2007). Since this uncertainty
is likely to be heterogeneously distributed by a partner’s age we control for this potential impact.
Partner’s age is defined based on its year of founding.
Partner’s public. As indicated previously, our interviews with practitioners suggested
they made minority equity or CVC investments in both early-stage firms that were private or
public. In either case what tends to be the motivating factor is that the underlying technology is
still nascent and highly uncertain. To delineate between these two types of partner firms we
define an indicator variable that equals one if a partner firm is already publicly traded (in the
year of investment), and zero otherwise.16
Partner’s patents. A partner firm’s internal technological capability is an important factor
that could potentially impact a corporate investor’s external R&D decision. As such, we estimate
the partner firm’s technological capability by calculating its stock of successful patent
applications, depreciated by 15% annually (Hall et al., 2005).

16

Results are robust to the exclusion of public partners however, as indicated previously, their inclusion was based
on discussions with practitioners. Their observation that these firms are still small with highly uncertain
technologies and differ little from their private counterparts is demonstrated in the data. In Appendix A4 we include
a table comparing descriptives between these two types of partner firms.
26

Dyadic and year fixed effects. We estimate the LPM models within-dyads, thus
controlling for unobserved time-invariant dyad-specific heterogeneity and use standard errors
clustered by dyads in all specifications. Yearly time dummies are also included over the sample
period in the LPM fixed effects models.
EMPIRICAL FINDINGS
Benchmark model: Cox Proportional hazard model with competing risks
Our benchmark results are obtained using a Cox proportional hazard model with
competing risks (Table 2). Models 1 through 5 analyze a corporate investor’s choice at the first
stage between making a CVC investment versus engaging in a license, acquisition, or R&Dfocused alliance, and show the impact of covariates on the sub-hazard of making CVC
investments. Specifically, our preferred model (Model 5) includes all variables and shows that a
one percentage point increase in the ratio of scientific publications per employee decreases the
sub-hazard of making a CVC investment by 37%, with the effect statistically significant at the 1%
level. This suggests that a stronger scientific capability of a corporate investor helps reduce
uncertainty, thereby decreasing the RO value of a CVC investment. Using a similar logic, the RO
value of CVC investments tends to increase when technologies pursued by partner firms are
more distant relative to the corporate investors. The sub-hazard of a CVC is 88% higher when
partner firms have technologies in areas that are new to corporate investors.
Notice that, while not a test of a formal hypothesis, the results in Table 2 (Model 5) also
show that a one-percentage point increase in a Partner’s early-stage technology increases the
sub-hazard of a CVC by over 100%, significant at the 1% level. This result supports the idea that
CVC investments are more likely to be made when partners have nascent technologies. Overall,
our results provide strong evidence in favor of the idea that conditions associated with higher
uncertainty tend to increase the value of CVC investments as a way to defer ex-post technology
27

acquisition requiring greater levels of commitment, thereby supporting Hypotheses 1a and 1b.
Consistent with Hypothesis 2, Model 5 also shows that a one-percentage point increase in
an Investor’s early-stage technology ratio tends to decrease the risk of making CVC investments
by 69.5%. This marginal effect is significant at the 10% level and suggests that as a corporate
investor’s pipeline becomes more heavily weighted toward early-stage innovations they may
have a more immediate need for later-stage innovations. As the proportion of later-stage
innovations fall it becomes more likely, for example, that a gap in the pipeline may occur (Chan
et al., 2007). This resulting shift will decrease a RO’s value because of the reduction in the time
(Higgins, 2007) available between initial CVC investment and the potential need to exercise an
option. In other words, firms in this position simply do not have the time needed to nurture a
CVC investment to maturity.
Finally, Models 6 and 7 analyze a corporate investor’s choice at the second stage of the
decision model. In particular, as reflected in Figure 1, we are interested in whether a corporate
investor engages in an ex post external R&D activity. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, Model 7
shows that the risk of ex post technology acquisition increases with a reduction in associated
uncertainty and when the value of the partner’s focal technology is high. That is, when the
coefficient of the interaction Value of partner’s technologies x Volatility of technical subfields is
negative. The interaction is significant at the 5% level.
Robustness analysis
We test the sensitivity of our results by estimating a panel data linear probability model
(LPM) with dyad fixed-effects and robust standard errors, presented in Table 3. These models are
obtained by re-defining the dependent variables in order to match the competing risks setting. In
particular, Models 1 through 5 relate to the test of Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 2. A discrete dependent
variable is defined as equal to one if, in any given year, a CVC tie between the focal investor28

partner dyad is observed, zero otherwise. This variable is treated as an absorbing state and
conditional on both parties having no prior CVC tie or other competing transactions in the dyad.
The LPM has advantages in that it allows us to utilize a panel data fixed-effects model
that controls for dyad-specific time invariant unobserved heterogeneity. The LPM results are also
easier to interpret since these estimates are identified exclusively by within dyad time variation
in the covariates. Finally, the LPM allows us to easily test the robustness to 2-way clustering of
standard errors using canned statistical software.17
The LPM has also limitations. In particular, it can predict probabilities outside the unit
interval, and its error term is heteroskedastic. However, with the use of standard
heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, the LPM often provides good estimates of the partial
effects on the response probability near the center of the distribution of the covariates
(Wooldridge, 2010: pg. 563). Due to the LPM limitations, we also estimated a logit model;
results suggest that our conclusions remain robust (see Appendix A5).
We take a similar approach to analyze the effect of uncertainty on the probability of
observing a technology purchase post-CVC investment (e.g., Hypothesis 3). We define a dummy
variable that turns to one if a license agreement in the dyad is the first event post-CVC
investment. This is treated as an absorbing state. We can thus use a fixed-effects LPM that only
exploits the post-CVC investment within dyad variance over time in the covariates. This allows
us to identify the interaction effect between technological uncertainty and the value of the focal
technologies on the decision to purchase a technology in the post-CVC investment period.
Our robustness results suggest that all our conclusions continue to hold after we control
for unobserved dyad-level heterogeneity. In particular, Model 5 shows that the probability of a

Results, reported in Appendix A5, suggest that conclusions remain robust.

first CVC investment, given no prior competing events: 1) decreases by 1.2 percentage points for
a corporate investor’s one percentage point increase in the number of scientific publications per
employee (significant at the 10%, Hypothesis 1a); 2) increases by 2.4 percentage points when a
partner firm operates in a technological area that is new to the corporate investor (significant at
the 1% level, Hypothesis 1b); and, 3) decreases by 2.5 percentage points when a corporate
investor’s ratio of early-stage innovations increase by one percentage point (significant at the 5%
level, Hypothesis 2). Model 7 shows that the interaction effect between the volatility of stock
market volume in a focal technological sub-field and the value of the focal innovation tends to
significantly decrease the probability of licensing in the post-CVC investment period (significant
at the 10% level, Hypothesis 3). The logit results (see Appendix A5) are consistent with the LPM
and support all of our hypotheses.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, it contributes to an emerging
research on the organization and financing patterns of external R&D activities (e.g., Robinson,
2008; Fulghieri and Sevilir, 2009). Combined with prior studies that investigate the linkages
between CVC investments and other types of external R&D strategy (e.g., Folta, 1998; Reuer et
al., 2002; Benson and Ziedonis, 2009 and 2010; Dushnitsky and Lavie, 2010), this study
suggests that CVC investments should be considered in conjunction with other types of external
R&D activity. This approach, we believe, is more appropriate because firms often pursue an
R&D strategy that is comprised of several types of external R&D activity simultaneously.
Consistent with this idea, our study highlights the role of CVC investments as ROs to enhance
the efficiency of technology licensing.
Second, this study also contributes to the literature on optimal organization and financing
arrangements between corporate investors and start-ups (e.g., Katila et al., 2008; Dushnitsky and
30

Shaver, 2009). Unlike that literature, however, which has investigated how resource constraints
and appropriation problems affect CVC investments, our study suggests that CVC investments
can be greatly determined by timing, which ultimately affects the level of uncertainty found in
the MFT.
Finally, this study is particularly important for the pharmaceutical industry, which has
faced severe productivity challenges in the last decade and where significant levels of
uncertainty are common (Arora and Gambardella, 1990 and 1994). As a result, effective
decisions on external R&D activity are critical in generating profits for growth (e.g., Nicholson
et al., 2005). Our findings imply that several types of external R&D activity co-exist, each
fulfilling their own strategic role in this industry.
This study has also important implications for managers. In particular, it implies that
managers should consider timing issues associated with each type of external R&D activity to
maximize firm productivity. This is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry, which
has long product development cycles. This study also implies that we need to better understand
how various types of external R&D affect one another. Our findings suggest that one type of
external R&D activity cannot be used independently from other types of activity; a consolidated
perspective on the various types of external R&D activity is needed. Finally, our focus on the
pharmaceutical industry suggests that our findings need to be interpreted carefully in the context
of other industries. This notion is important because each industry has its own technological and
managerial environment and uses CVC investments according to its own context.
All studies have limitations and ours is no different. While we consider the conditions
under which CVC investments are made and executed, we do not consider post-execution
performance. Empirical evidence on whether corporate investors realize benefits from CVC

31

investments is limited and mixed. Benson and Ziedonis (2010) find that while corporate
investors in the IT sector appear to be overall relatively “good acquirers”, they tended to overpay
for targets from their CVC portfolio. They explore numerous explanations for this puzzling result
but ultimately argue that it stems from managerial overconfidence. In contrast, Allen and Hevert
(2007) find that thirty-nine percent of CVC programs, also from the IT sector, generated internal
rates of return that exceeded their parents’ cost of capital. Returns to larger programs, those with
more than $95 million of investment, were substantial with thirty-six percent of those programs
generating cumulative net cash flows greater than $100 million.
While consistent with Dushnitsky (2011), it is striking that in our pharmaceutical sample
so few of the partner firms were purchased in the post-CVC investment time period. Instead, the
most likely corporate form of option execution was a technology license. Whether it is an issue
of governance structure, transaction cost, research setting or even sample construction, the
differences between our study and Benson and Ziedonis (2010) are worthy of exploration.
Our interviews with CVC program managers as well as our contract review pointed to
several key differences with the literature worthy of future discussion. First, the presence of
board seats appeared to be far more limited in this industry. An interesting tension exists between
venture capitalists and corporate investors. In general, VCs are interested in a liquidity event so
they have an interest in pushing a company towards IPO as quickly as possible. On the other
hand, corporate investors in this industry are primarily interested in the underlying technology.
They may be more interested in taking things a bit more slow. Given that CVCs are rarely the
first to invest in this industry they are almost walking into a situation where an existing VC has
some control over the deal. This difference with board seats may be solely of research setting or
it may be pointing to a broader underlying tension between VCs and CVCs.

32

Second, based on our interviews we broadened our sample to include both partners that
were private at the time of investment and those that were public. The common characteristic
between both types of firms is that their underlying technologies were still nascent and highly
uncertain. From the corporate investors’ prospective the motivation for a CVC remains the same;
they are clearly interested in a future technology. While the academic literature will often limit
CVC samples to solely investments in private partners, our work suggests that these minority
equity investments in these early-stage public firms should also be included. Interesting future
work should focus on whether those differences in risk profiles (i.e., between a private and
public partner) have any impact not on option execution but rather ultimate productivity.
Finally, prior work by Higgins and Rodriguez (2006), Chan et al. (2007) and Danzon et
al. (2007) focus on the impact of late-stage productivity changes, gaps and declines on a firm’s
decision to enter the ex post technology market. In contrast, this paper focuses on a firm’s
proportion of early-stage projects and their choice to enter the ex ante technology market. All
firms are resource constrained and face various demands emanating from different areas of their
research portfolio. In short, firms need to make trade-offs between the various stages/phases of
research, the mix of internal versus external R&D, and the type of corporate strategies to employ
to best achieve those goals. All of these papers are pointing towards the need to more fully
understand research portfolio optimization in a dynamic context.

Figure 1. Two-stage sequential decision model and map to prior literature
Conditional on entering the external technology markets, firms can make a series of investment choices. We model
the initial two-stages of that process and map the current literature. The branches A, B, C and D relate to Stage 1
while branches E, F, G, H, I, J, and K relate to Stage 2 activities. For example, the Van de Vrande and Vanhaverbeke
(2013) paper is mapped to 2.G. That is, the paper focuses on how prior CVC relationships affect the likelihood of a
subsequent strategic alliance. In Benson and Ziedonis (2009), coded 1.B vs. 2.F, they focus on acquisitions of firms
with prior CVC investments (2.F) versus those that do not (1.B). Our paper is the first to holistically consider CVC
investments (1.A) relative to 1.B, 1.C, and 1.D and then conditional on a CVC investment the eventual outcome,
2.E, 2.F, 2.G, or 2.H, during our sample. It is also the first paper to demonstrate the importance of licensing in Stage
2 (2.E) in a context where CVC are made primarily to gain a window on future technology that could be later
acquired. (Note, all references are provided in Appendix A3. They are included in the reference section if cited in the
paper.)

Description
The dependent variables for our analysis are based on the time until
the occurrence of the first CVC investment or time to the first License
or Acquisition post-CVC. In order to compute these variables, we
defined an outcome variable
as describing the
following types of events characterizing the relationship between
corporate investor-partner i (the dyad) at year t, with the time
subscript omitted:
corresponds to no observed external R&D
activity between the corporate investor and the partner;
corresponds to a corporate investor making a CVC investment in the
partner;
corresponds to a corporate investor licensing a
technology from the partner;
corresponds to a corporate
investor acquiring the partner; and,
corresponds to a corporate
investor forming a R&D-focused alliance with the partner;
corresponds to an investor licensing a technology from the partner
after a CVC;
corresponds to an investor acquiring the partner
after a CVC;
corresponds to an investor undertaking an R&D
alliance after a CVC; and
corresponds to an investor holding
the CVC investment in its portfolio.
The ratio of the number of scientific papers published by corporate
investor employees per thousands of employee
An indicator variable that equals one if a partner firm has a patent in
areas that are new to the corporate investor, zero otherwise (dyadlevel)
The proportion of early-stage technologies of a corporate investor
The number of novel drugs within a partner firm’s research pipeline,
with novelty defined as either the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th compound
approved or furthest along the development process with a similar
pharmacological and therapeutic combination (e.g., number of
portfolio firm’s drugs classified by PharmaProjects with highest
novelty codes of “5” or “6”).
Average 52-week volatility (i.e., standard deviation) of stock trading
volume of public companies that operate in each subfield (in
thousands)
The number of drugs within the corporate investor’s research pipeline
(i.e., preclinical, Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3)
Corporate investor’s number of employees (thousands)
Corporate investor’s retained earnings ($ billions)
Corporate investor’s stock of successful patent applications
depreciated by 15% annually (in thousands)
An indicator variable equal to one if a corporate investor previously
made a CVC investment in other firms, zero otherwise
An indicator variable equal to one if a corporate investor previously
engaged in an acquisition or license with another firm, zero otherwise
The number of drugs within a partner firm’s research pipeline
The proportion of early-stage technologies of a partner
An indicator variable that equals one if a partner firm received
independent venture capital funding, zero otherwise
The cumulative amount of funding raised by a partner firm from
venture capitalists ($ billions)
The time between the year of founding and the year of focal event
An indicator variable that equals one if a partner firm is publicly
traded at time of investment, zero otherwise
The stock of successful patent applications depreciated by 15%
annually (in thousands)

, , and * denote significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. Robust standard errors clustered by dyads in Italics. The total number of
observations is reduced relative to Table 2 since observations (within dyads) post-CVC or post lic/acq are dropped (e.g., events are treated
as absorbing states). ^ In the regressions, investor’s pipeline and employees have been scaled by thousands and millions, respectively.

Note: This table reports the number of external R&D deals in the dataset by type, year, and stage. Since the table
summarizes the data at the transaction, rather than at the dyad level, the number of CVC, licensing, and acquisitions does
not equal the corresponding number of deals considered in the event history models (which analyze the occurrence of the
first CVC deal, or ex post technology acquisition transaction, within dyads) presented in the following tables.
