People and Machines: A Look at the Evolving Relationship Between Capital and Skill In Manufacturing
1860-1930 Using Immigration Shocks
Jeanne Lafortune, José Tessada, and Ethan Lewis
NBER Working Paper No. 21435
July 2015

ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the elasticity of substitution between capital and skill using variation across U.S.
counties in immigration-induced skill mix changes between 1860 and 1930. We find that capital began
as a q-complement for skilled and unskilled workers, and then dramatically increased its relative complementary
with skilled workers around 1890. Simulations of a parametric production function calibrated to our
estimates imply the level of capital-skill complementarity after 1890 likely allowed the U.S. economy
to absorb the large wave of less-skilled immigration with a modest decline in less-skilled relative wages.
This would not have been possible under the older production technology.

Rising inequality and persistently high unemployment are once again raising concerns that
technological change is outpacing many workers’ ability to adapt to it (Brynjolfsson and McAffee,
2011).1 These concerns echo with stunning similarity those of earlier times of disruption, including the Great Depression (e.g., Jerome, 1934; Keynes, 2008) and industrialization (e.g., Marx,
1932). Indeed, the conventional view is that the sorts of changes now leading to greater inequality have been ongoing since at least the early twentieth century (Goldin and Katz, 1998), and
possibly even earlier (Katz and Margo, 2013). In this view, capital-skill complementarity, combined with the falling relative cost of capital (which embodies much of technological change),
have pushed up relative demand for skilled labor (See also Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante., 2000).2 In modern times this is thought to be due to advances in computers (e.g., Autor,
Levy and Murnane, 2003), but in an earlier era, qualitatively similar patterns of mechanization,
driven primarily by the spread of electricity, may have relatively benefitted skilled workers (e.g.,
Gray, 2013; Jerome, 1934).3
Is this conventional view correct? This project revisits the origins of capital-skill complementarity using a common data source and identification strategy across the period both before
and after the mechanization of manufacturing, starting in the mid-nineteenth century and finishing at the outset of the Great Depression. Following the literature on technology and firms
during the period we study, we focus solely on the manufacturing sector.4 To identify the level
of complementarity between skill and capital, we exploit the predictable effect that large waves
of immigration (and, implicitly, immigration restrictions) in the nineteenth and early twentieth
century had on each U.S. county’s skill mix, and ask how capital intensity of the industries in the
area responded.5 We do not rely on actual regional patterns of immigration, but instead use an
“ethnic enclave” or “shift-share” style instrumental variable strategy which essentially imputes
the impact of immigration on skill mix based on apportioning national arrivals, by origin, to their
“ethnic enclaves” in a base year. This strategy has been used successfully in modern immigration
research (e.g., Card, 2001; Cortés, 2008), but until recently, has seen little application in historical
data (though see Goldin, 1994). Our approach is facilitated by manufacturing sector data we
have entered from tabulations of Censuses of Manufactures at the county/city and industry level
1 See

also “The Future of Jobs: The Onrushing Wave,” The Economist, January 2014.
this view, the reason inequality in the U.S. has not always been on an upward trajectory is that at some times
in U.S. history this demand trend has been offset by rising education levels (Goldin and Katz, 2008).
3 We are glossing over the view that recent –and possibly past– technological change was “polarizing,” rather than
purely inequality increasing (e.g., Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Autor et al., 2003; Goos and Manning, 2007; Gray, 2013;
Katz and Margo, 2013).
4 This is an important caveat because technical change outside the sector may have been different (Katz and Margo,
2013). However, we believe the manufacturing sector is important in the period we are examining because its evolution
seems to be closely related to the exact technological innovations that have been mentioned in the literature as the
drivers of the changes around the turn of the twentieth century.
5 This approach parallels the approach of Lewis (2011) used in modern manufacturing data, and Lafortune, Tessada
and Gonzalez-Velosa (2013) in historical agricultural data. The use of regional differences in skill mix to identify
capital-skill complementarity goes back to at least Griliches (1969).

from 1860 to 1930, and by skill mix and immigration data at the county level from the Censuses
of Population. This allows us to investigate whether, if we go back far enough in time, skilled
arrivals to an area ever induced local manufacturing plants to decrease their capital intensity,
consistent with capital being more complementary with unskilled than skilled labor, rather than
increase their capital intensity, consistent with capital being more complementary with skilled
labor, as it seems to be in modern manufacturing.
Our data allow us to control for detailed industry effects, thus removing any confounding
factors such as changes in the production mix or other structural trends. In other words, we are
able to examine changes in factor intensity within industry in our preferred specification.6
We will also use our estimates to try to infer something about the likely impact of immigration
during this era. It has previously been shown that, in theory, the impacts of immigration-driven
skill mix changes on relative wages can be substantially muted when capital complements skill
compared to when it does not (e.g., Lewis, 2013).7 Whether this makes any difference at realistic
parameter values, however, has never been evaluated. We turn to an era in which the set of production choices may have been quite different from modern times, even while concerns about the
impact of technological change and immigration were quite similar to modern times, motivating
our interest.
Our instrumental variables estimates suggest that immigration had a significant impact on
skill ratios –literacy rates– in local labor markets.8 Furthermore, capital intensity responded
to changing skill intensity, and its response changed over time. 1860-1880, capital’s response
was consistent with it being a q-complement of both skilled and unskilled labor, and, unlike
today, the complementarity was stronger with unskilled labor. This changed dramatically during
the period 1890-1930, when capital became relatively more complementary with skilled labor
(consistent with previous research on early twentieth century manufacturing Goldin and Katz
(1998)) and a q-substitute for unskilled labor.9 Shifts in industry mix are negligible in either
set of results.10 Despite the fact that we therefore find that immigration induces large withinindustry changes in skill ratios, simulations of a parametric production function calibrated to our
6 This also allows another motivation for this analysis: we can use our approach to ask whether shifts in industry
mix are an important source of adjustment to immigration-driven skill mix shocks. Simple small, open economy
models predict that shifts in input mix will be absorbed, at least in part, by changes in traded industry mix (see, e.g.,
Leamer, 1995). Although this sort of model enjoys little empirical support in modern data, one study finds strong
support for it in agricultural data from this era (Lafortune et al., 2013), reopening this question.
7 The relative wage impacts of skill mix shocks may also be muted during periods when modes of production of
substantially different factor intensities overlap, such as, potentially, artisanal and factory production (Beaudry, Doms
and Lewis, 2010; Caselli and Coleman, 2006)
8 Although this first result is very basic, it is also important. Without it –if, as it has been suggested, U.S. labor
markets at this time were highly geographically integrated by inter-city migration (Rosenbloom, 2002)– our approach
would not be feasible.
9 The response of capital we estimate is not always statistically significant, however.
10 This reinforces that the significant response of industry mix in the agriculture sector to immigration during this
period (Lafortune et al., 2013) has to do with the lack of specificity of capital in agriculture, rather than something
else about this period.

estimates suggest that the flood of less-skilled immigrants from the turn of the twentieth century
likely had a modest impact on less-skilled relative wages (a 7% decline), as they were mitigated
by a decrease in capital intensity in response to the change in skill ratios.11 In contrast, under
the older production technology in which capital was not a substitute for, but a complement of
low-skill labor, the same immigration wave would have pushed down low-skilled relative wages
severely (perhaps as much as 35%).

Historical Background

Immigrants have shaped the U.S. manufacturing sector throughout its history. From Samuel
Slater memorizing and bringing the plans for textile machines to the U.S., to the skilled British
and other European artisans of the nineteenth century, and finally to the masses of less-skilled
immigrant labor filling factories, immigrants have consistently played a prominent role in U.S.
manufacturing (e.g., Berthoff, 1953). Interestingly, a prominent contemporaneous account of
early twentieth century manufacturing states that its main initial motivation was to investigate
how well mechanization had allowed the manufacturing sector to adapt to the severe immigration restrictions of the mid-1920s (Jerome, 1934).12 The study’s purpose was later shifted to
include an investigation of the contribution of technological change to unemployment. This was
of heightened concern during the Great Depression, when the study was completed, but it comes
up continually and is being raised again in today’s relatively high unemployment environment
(Brynjolfsson and McAffee, 2011).
The two motivations for Jerome’s study are really two sides of the same coin: new technologies have different skill requirements, and immigration (or its restriction) can shift the set of
skills available. Many have argued the arrival of factories reduced demand for skilled artisan
labor but raised demand for less-skilled production workers performing simple, repetitive tasks.
For example, Atack, Bateman and Margo (2004) found using 1850-80 data that larger manufacturing plants –an indicator of factory (non-artisanal) production– paid lower wages, an indicator
of lower average skill. On the flip side, it is the availability of less-skilled labor to fill factories
that enabled the adoption of factory production. In particular, Goldin and Sokoloff (1984) argue
that such labor was only readily available in Northern U.S. in the mid-nineteenth century, which
is why the north industrialized first. Women and children initially filled such factories; in the
South, in contrast, women and children’s labor was already demanded by agriculture. Rosen11 We

have also directly estimated the impact of immigration on the wage structure using the wage gap between
“salaried officials” and “wage workers” in the census of manufacturing data, which is available starting in 1890, and
found no significant relationship. However, at best this provides a noisy proxy for relative wages and these estimates
are confounded by direct compositional impacts of immigration.
12 On page 3, Jerome states “Our survey had its origin in the hectic years of the post-War decade as an inquiry
into the extent to which the effects of immigration restriction upon the supply of labor were likely to be offset by an
increasing use of labor-saving machinery”.

bloom (2002) makes a similar argument about the latter half of the nineteenth century: he argues
a shortage of skilled labor in local markets might have pushed producers towards adopting more
labor-intensive methods (e.g., p. 87). Kim (2007) shows that in 1850-1880, U.S. counties with
higher immigrant density had larger manufacturing establishments. Chandler (1977) argues that
modern manufacturing required professional management, and you also see evidence of a shift
to more “white collar” jobs in the late nineteenth century (Katz and Margo, 2013).
After the switch to factory production from an artisanal system, manufacturing is thought to
have begun, perhaps somewhere around the turn of the twentieth century, a switch to continuous production system relying increasingly on electricity and large (more recently, automated)
machinery, which Jerome called “mechanization.”13 The exact timing may have differed by industry, and of particular interest to us, location.14 Goldin and Katz (1998) argue and provide
evidence that the latter change is associated with greater skill and capital requirements, and so
capital and skill became complementary by the early twentieth century, as they continue to be in
modern times (e.g., Griliches, 1969; Lewis, 2011). They show that industries with greater capitaland electricity intensity had higher average production wages in 1919 and 1929, and had more
educated workers in 1939. There are some different, or perhaps more nuanced, views of what
mechanization did to skill requirements. Gray (2013) found that states which electrified more
saw large relative increases in the employment of non-production workers, but among production workers decreases in the proportion of jobs requiring “dexterity” - which includes craftsman
- relative to those requiring manual labor. She argues the overall effect was to “polarize” labor
demand, as craftsmen were likely in the middle of the wage distribution. In contrast, Jerome
(1934) argued that conveyer belts and other handling technologies may have reduced demand
for manual labor.
In an earlier era, Goldin and Katz (1998) argue that factory output likely substituted for
the less capital-intensive artisanal production. This is a sensible view, but it is only directly
supported by a solitary study: James and Skinner (1985). They show that in 1850 capital and
labor were more substitutable in manufacturing sectors that were more skill-intensive than in
sectors that were less skill-intensive, though the paper does not describe how the skill intensity
of the sectors was assessed.
Many of the studies above use variation in some capital-use measure –the right-hand side
variable– to estimate the response of skill mix measures. We examine the other side of the
coin: how immigration-induced changes in skill mix are associated with adjustments in various
13 Goldin and Katz (1998) present a slightly richer evolution in which the assembly line is another step between
factories and mechanized continuous production.
14 As an example of cross-industry heterogeneity, Berthoff (1953) describes how machines for weaving cotton textiles
were developed much earlier than those for weaving woolen textiles. Similarly, Jerome’s surveys suggest that steel
and iron adopted mechanized production methods earlier than other industries. In terms of regional heterogeneity,
Jerome (1934) found considerable cross-state variation in industrial power use, which is also the variation that Gray
(2013) relies on in her study on the impact of mechanization on skill demand.

measures of capital use. Like the twin motivations for Jerome’s study, both approaches should
reveal the nature of the complementarity between capital and skills (demonstrated below). Our
approach will also give insight in the ability of the economy to “absorb” large immigrant inflows,
as adjustments to technology can help mitigate the impact of immigration on the wages of nativeborn workers (Lewis, 2013).
There is another way in which the economy may have absorbed immigrants: immigrants may
shift the industry mix, as Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) trade theory would suggest. In early twentieth
century agriculture, for example, Lafortune et al. (2013) find evidence that immigration shifted
the mix of crops towards more labor-intensive ones. This is interesting per se because, in the
extreme case where HO fully holds, an economy can adjust to skill mix changes without any
long-run impact on the wage structure; more generally, such adjustments mitigate the wage impact of immigration. In addition, changes in industry mix may confound changes in production
technology: to the extent that production technology differs across industries, an impact of immigration on industry mix may make it (spuriously) appear that production technology has shifted
at an aggregate level. The solution is to examine changes in production technology within detailed industries –in other words, to hold industry constant– a purpose which motivates our data
collection, described below. Before turning to that, however, we describe a theoretical approach
will motivate our empirical approach.

Theoretical Framework

Our work starts from a simple framework that considers a single (aggregate) production function
with three production factors: capital (K), high skilled labor (H) and low skilled labor (L), which
is a common formulation both in the immigration and the technology adoption literatures (see for
example Lewis, 2011, 2013), so let Y = g( H, L, K ), where Y is aggregate output.15 We assume the
production function is constant returns to scale and satisfies standard quasi-concavity constraints
(g j < 0 and g jj < 0 ∀ j ∈ { H, L, K }). Throughout we also assume that the capital is supplied
elastically to that production method and that the interest rate is fixed at the economy level.
Under these assumptions, the capital stock adjusts to maintain equality

product and the cost of capital, which implies that in equilibrium d ln

Substracting d ln L from both sides of this, we derive the following expression, which describes the impact of a change in the endowment of high-to-low-skilled workers on the capitalto-low-skilled labor ratio:

< 0. One can also subtract d ln H from both sides to derive a
symmetric expression for the complementarity between capital and low skill labor from the
response of the capital-to-high-skill labor ratio to changes in the relative endowment of high skill
workers. The problem with this approach is that it is not robust to mismeasurement of who is
high and low skill, which is a serious concern in the economic census data we will use (which
at best contains only crude cuts of “skill.”). If our empirical definition of “L” in the left-hand
side of (2) included some high skill workers, what we would get instead is a weighted average of
the complementarity between capital and high and capital and low skill labor. What’s worse, in
the earliest census data we have, we can observe only the total workforce, N = L + H. Defining
φh = H/N, the share of workers who are high skill, the best we can observe in these years is:

Note that the relationship between K/N and H/L is not dispositive, on its own, of the level

indicates whether capital and high-skill labor are complementary or substitutes and the relative
degree of that relationship compared to that of low-skill workers.
We can also obtain similar information simply by evaluating the response of the capital16 The

∂L /Y is the low-skill’s share.

If capital is particularly complementary to low-skill labor, we would thus anticipate a negative
response of the capital-output ratio to an increase in the skill ratio.
The relationship of capital intensity to skill ratios is important in understanding how changes
in capital affect relative skill demand. This can be seen explicitly by rewriting (4) as

The numerator of (5) contains the response of high-skill relative wages (with WH = ∂Y/∂H and
WL = ∂Y/∂L), assuming workers are paid their marginal product, to capital, which has the same
sign as the response of capital-output ratios to increases in high-skill relative supply.17 (5) is an
explicit reminder us that complementarities work in both directions: the estimated response of
the capital-to-output ratio to changes in relative skill supply also reveals the other side of the
coin, how capital adoption affects relative skill demand. This is useful, as measures of the wage
structure are quite crude during this era.
Indeed, our estimates of the relationships above could also be used to learn something about
the likely magnitude of the response of relative wage to changes in skill endowments. A simple
derivative identity reveals that

represents the short-run (capital fixed) relative wage adjustment to a change in

relative skill supply, which is negative. Note that this expression implies that the long-run relative
wage impacts of a change in skill ratios (say, induced by immigration) may be smaller or larger
than this depending on the relative complementarity of capital with skill. If capital complements
∂ ln(WH /WL )
∂ ln K

and
> 0 – then the long-run response of relative wages to immigration is diminished
by the adjustment of capital.18 Relative wage impacts are larger than this when capital is skill
skilled labor relative to unskilled labor – if the response in (5) is positive, so that
∂ ln K
∂ ln( H/L)

17 Indeed, as will describe again in Section 5, a positive response to capital of the marginal product of skilled
labor that is larger in proportional terms than the response of unskilled labor is often what is called “capital-skill
complementarity” (e.g., Krusell et al., 2000). We will instead attempt to describe this more precisely by saying
“capital is a (q-)complement of skilled labor relative to unskilled labor.”
18 While for this to be true it is necessary that capital be not just a relative, but an absolute complement of skill –

helpful in delineating this point. It is common for studies of the modern-day labor market

and H and L remains the same (σ), the long-run relationship

Alternative Models

Empirically, apparent shifts in capital intensity are potentially confounded

by endogenous shifts in industry mix predicted by simple open economy models (so-called “Rybczynski effects”). With one historical exception (Lafortune et al., 2013), these have generally
been found to be small in response to immigration-induced skill mix shocks (e.g., Card and
Lewis, 2007; Gonzales and Ortega, 2011; Lewis, 2003). The primary way in which we will address this is with industry controls, a key motivation for our data collection.
Up to now we have worked under the assumption that we can represent the economy with
an aggregate production function. However, this is not necessarily the only way to model the adjustment to the changes in the relative endowment of high-to-low-skilled labor. In particular, as
Beaudry and Green (2003) suggest, if there are two modes of production, each of them characterized by different intensities of use of the factors, then the economy can respond to the changes in
the relative endowments choosing a different mode of production rather than just moving along
the same isoquant as before. In this era, this might be represented by a shift between “artisanal”
and “factory” production. Since the latter is thought to be more capital-intensive, this potentially
also confounds our estimates. Researchers typically proxy for factor production with plant size
(e.g., Kim, 2007), so we will also study plant size as an outcome (in the appendix).

1 (t ∈ {early}) and 1 (t ∈ {late}) are, respectively, indicators for the first and second half of our
sample period (defined below), and νc , δc ηt , and µit represent country, time and industry-time
fixed effects.19 All standard errors will be clustered at the geographical level and regressions are
weighted as to give each geographical location the same weight.
Since our interest lies in comparing the evolution of the production function over our sample,
we divide it between an early period and a late period, allowing γ to change between the two.
We unfortunately do not have sufficient variation to reliably estimate γ separately by decade,
though we can estimate it with as few as two decades. So what we do instead is move the cut-off
points between an “early” and and “late” period to attempt to identify when, if any, changes
seem to have occurred in the relationship we attempt to estimate. Since historical analyses by
Chandler (1977) and Jerome (1934) argue that the Second Industrial Revolution transformed the
productive process of manufacturing, we will look for a change around the 1880-1890 period,
years during which some of the elements of the Second Industrial Revolution took place.
The interpretation of the coefficient γ depends on the relevant outcome that is being estimated
(as shown by the equations (3) and (4)). In equation (4), for example, where ln(K/Y ) is the
outcome, it captures the complementarity between capital and skill relative to capital and lowskill: γ will be positive if capital complements skilled labor relative to unskilled labor (γ > 0
implies that ∂ ln(WH /WL )/∂K > 0).
Motivated in part by Goldin and Katz (1998)’s argument that capital-skill complementarity
arises across sectors (in their model, across the combination of a machine- and goods-producing
sectors), we also explore whether county- or city-wide (aggregate) outcomes are influenced by
estimating the following equation, which corresponds to equation (8) but using data aggregated

context, to add one more period to our analysis, namely using as “early” up to 1900 and the results are similar.

In this specification K/Jct corresponds to the aggregate outcome variables from the previous
estimation equation measured at the county level. Standard errors are again clustered at the
county level and regressions are unweighted. In this case we can explore how the county as
whole adjusts to the changes in the skill-mix of workers. Estimates of (9) may alternatively
viewed as suffering from aggregation bias: shifts in output mix towards industries that use a
different production technology could confound the results. This is why the industry-city data,
which allow us to estimate (8) instead, are useful. The difference between Equations (8) and (9)
would be driven by industrial composition shifts that occurred in response to changes in factor
endowments. In the appendix, we also test this directly by using as an outcome variable the
share of labor in industries that use some factors more intensively.

3.2

Identification strategy

Although our estimation equation and model are tightly linked, in practice identification is an
issue: skill mix is likely to be endogenous, as workers’ location (or skill acquisition) decisions are
influenced by where their skills are most highly paid. Thus, depending on how our outcomes are
correlated with relative wages, we could be over or under-estimating the relationship between
our variables of interest. Furthermore, it is important to note that manufacturing is only one
sector in the broad economy – a minority of employment – so local demand shocks outside
the manufacturing could be an important source of endogeneity.20 It is thus difficult to sign
exactly the bias of the basic correlations. OLS estimates might also be attenuated by error in the
measurement of skill ratios due to sample variation.21
To solve these problem, we attempt to identify relative skill supply shocks using immigrationdriven shocks to the relative endowment of high-to-low-skilled labor. As immigrants are themselves likely to elect locations based on economic conditions, we use in place of actual immigration, the impact that predicted inflows of immigrants, based on historical regional settlement
20 According to the Census of Population, it ranges from roughly to one quarter to one third of employment in
identified cities over the years in our sample, using industry codes constructed by Ruggles, Alexander, Genadek,
Goeken, Schroeder and Sobek (2010).
21 We can get some sense of the magnitude of this using tabulated data on literacy rates by area (Minnesota Population Center, 2011), which are available for some (but not all) of the years in our sample. The comparison between our
estimated literacy rates and the tabulated ones, conditional on the full set of fixed effects, suggests that OLS estimates
might be 10-15% attenuated due to measurement error.

where j represents each country or state of birth, c (US) county, and t period; N is the stock of

the numerator and denominator includes

Njc0
Nj0 ,

which represents the share of individuals from

j living in c in some base year. This is used to apportion the current stocks of immigrants by
country and natives by state of birth to locations within the U.S. Thus, the instrument represents
the ratio in the number of high- and low-skill individuals, respectively, that would be living in
c if immigrants and natives were still apportioned across counties in the same manner as they
were in the base year. This style of instrument has been widely used to study modern-day
immigration impacts (see, for example Card, 2001; Cortés, 2008; Lewis, 2011) but until recently
has seen limited application in this historical context. It attempts to circumvent the problem
of endogenous location choice by allocating individuals to counties based on the location of
immigrants from one’s country of birth or one’s state of birth in previous waves. We use the
previous location of all immigrants instead of allowing high- and low-skilled individuals from a
given country to be distributed in a distinct way such that these shares are less likely to capture
economic conditions particularly suitable for a given skill level. Lafortune and Tessada (2013)
provided significant evidence of ethnic network’s role in the determination of the first location of
immigrants arriving to the U.S., which supports the validity of the instrument. This contrasts a bit
with Rosenbloom (2002)’s argument that labor markets were highly integrated by interregional
(at least within the North) and even international migration (from Europe) by the late nineteenth
century, although he also provides evidence that explicit international recruiting was a trivial
component of factory hires (chapter 3). We return to this argument when we discuss the first
stage: if true in the extreme, there would be no first stage relationship and our approach would
not be feasible. As immigration patterns evolved over the entire period, we will use two base
years: 1850 for 1860-1880 and 1880 for 1890-1940.
We modify the typical instrument by adding migration across states by natives as well. (10)
including only immigrant groups in the index j does quite a good job of predicting immigrant
skill ratios. However, we need something which predicts proportional total changes in skill ratios,
so we need to normalize it by some defensibly exogenous measure of the skill ratio of natives
in the area. The approach we settled on was to treat natives’ state of origin as another set of
“groups.”22
22 Another approach we tried was similar to Smith (2012)’s approach of obtaining the predicted skills of natives. We
used the base year ratio of high- and low-skill natives interacted with the national growth rate of skills among native-

11

The identification strategy has to fulfill the following two requirements to be valid. First,
the total national stock of immigrant from a particular country at time t must not be correlated
with differential shocks to manufacturing industries across counties. Given that few counties
include a very large fraction of immigrants from a given country, it is difficult to imagine that
the increase in the number of immigrants from a given skill group in a given country is driven
by the higher demand for that skill in one or two counties. Second, the location choice made
by immigrants in base years among counties should be uncorrelated with differential changes in
the manufacturing innovations of the future. Namely, immigrants did not locate in cities where
they anticipated that their skills was going to become more valuable in the future. We attenuate
the concern regarding this second condition by using the stock of all immigrants (not only the
ones of a given skill level) to predict the location of both skilled and unskilled workers in the
future. This is preferred because the location choices of skilled versus unskilled workers in the
base year may be more related to the anticipated changes in the manufacturing sector than the
location choices of their aggregate.
Thus our instrument represents a predicted skill ratio based on the interaction of initial conditions and national changes in the skill and country-composition of workers. Because it is structured like the actual skill ratio, a first stage coefficient of one means that predicted immigrationdriven changes in skill mix have a one-for-one impact on the actual skill ratio; coefficients different than one imply that the actual skill mix is offset by either native migratory response or other
offsetting demographic changes (for example, if trends in native-born literacy differed in highand low-immigration markets).

Data and Descriptive Statistics

Information regarding the number of high and low-skill individuals in a given locality can be
obtained in each decade from IPUMS data (Ruggles et al., 2010) from 1860 to 1930 (except in 1890,
which are estimated from 100% tabulations in U.S. Department of Interior, United States Census
Office, 1897, –see C.4 in the Data Appendix). There are really two options for defining “skill” in
these data: occupation or literacy.23 An advantage of literacy is that it is something close to a prelabor market skill, whereas occupation-derived measures are a match between workers’ skills and
local labor market demand conditions. Furthermore, literacy is available uniformly during the
period. It also correlates relatively well with the distinction of production and non-production
workers where literacy would have been essential for the second type of employment but not for
born workers. Thus, this version of the instrument represented the predicted skill ratio given the initial locations of
immigrants and natives and national changes in the country mix of immigrants and the skill mix of immigrants and
natives. Similar results were obtained and are available upon request.

to that time.

the first. Finally, it has also been documented that US natives achieved higher rates of growth in
literacy than sending countries, making immigration particularly important in determining the
illiteracy of the US labor force.
Recall that we use predicted immigration as a shock to skill mix local labor markets that
immigration generates over the period 1860 to 1930. This is a period of great potential for this
purpose as immigration flows were very large. It also includes periods of slower immigration
driven by potentially exogenous factors (Civil War, First World War) and by a dramatic change in
the legal environment (1924’s Johnson Act). We propose to use an instrumental variable approach
as detailed above in equation (10). To construct this instrument, we require a reliable estimate of
the location of immigrants of different origins in a “base year” (the Njc0 /Nj0 in (10)). Recall that
we use two different base years, 1850 and 1880. For both we obtained 100% samples. For 1850,
the data came from the preliminary samples of the North Atlantic Population Project (Ruggles et
al., 2010) and by querying www.ancestry.com (for states not yet available); and for 1880, we used
a 100% sample from IPUMS. We use these 100% tables to alleviate concerns of small-cell biases
(see Aydemir and Borjas, 2010). We also need to obtain the national stock of immigrants from
each country by country/state of birth and skill. In principle, there are several ways we could
have constructed the national number of high and low-skill immigrants arriving after 1850. To
be as consistent as possible, we chose to measure the with the stocks from each country (and U.S.
state) in 1860 to 1930 by aggregating IPUMS data. The 1890 data had to again be constructed from
tabulations, and in some cases by interpolating between 1880 and 1900 data (see Data Appendix).
Our outcome variables focus on the adjustment mechanisms in the manufacturing sector over
this period. Our conceptual framework calls for data at the level of the labor market x industry.
These can be obtained from published Manufacturing Census tabulations. Conveniently for our
analysis, manufacturing censuses occurred roughly concurrently with the Census of Population
over this entire period. Unfortunately, the tabulations are available only in paper format but we
have digitalized them.24
One issue in covering such a long time series is that the unit of geography reported in these
tables changes over time. We merged counties over time to ensure that borders were very similar
between years. In 1860 and 1870, the data are only available by county while in 1880 and later, the
main geographic tabulations are for largest cities, occasionally supplemented by tabulations for
selected urban counties. Because of this change of geography, and because, with rare exception,
cities are within county boundaries, we have chosen to make “county” the unit of analysis for
our skill ratio measure, matching each city to the county they correspond to.25
24 See

Data Appendix for an exact description of all tables we entered for this project.
only significant exception to this is New York City, which spans multiple counties and whose county composition changes over time. We therefore construct New York City to cover the five “boroughs” (counties) that make it
up at the end of the period throughout the entire 1860-1930 period. This aggregates together Brooklyn and New York
City, which reported as separate cities in earlier years.
25 The

13

In later years there is a minimum “cell size” to be included (often, at least 3 establishments)
while in 1860 and 1870, it appears that almost all establishments were tabulated.26 However, even
with these reporting restrictions, there is “balancedness” in the sense that the industries detailed
for each city often repeat, allowing us to use panel methods as detailed in the empirical methods
section.27
While we obtained measures for a variety of outcomes, we here focus on capital, labor and
output, which are the ingredients of our theoretical framework. Value of products and costs are
available for the full period, which allows us to define value-added as our measure of output
(Y). To measure labor (N), we use the measure of all workers. Value of capital, our key variable,
is only available from 1860 to 1920. However, in 1910, 1920 and 1930, we have a measure of
horsepower which we use to obtain a proxy measure of capital for 1930 based on the relationship
between horsepower and capital in the two previous decades.28 Since this measure of capital
includes all forms of capital (land, buildings, machinery and equipment), we may also wish
to look at a measure that focuses a bit more directly on machines instead of land. We first
propose to use horsepower directly. As we discussed before, this variable is available for 19101930. Before 1910, we impute horsepower from machinery capital for 1890 and 1900, which is
separately reported in these two years.29 Before 1890, we were unable to obtain any similar
measures but from the sample data of Atack and Bateman (1999), we were able to find evidence
that very few firms had positive horsepower in 1860. We thus replace our measure of horsepower
with 0.1 for 1860 for all industries and counties.30 Finally, capital utilization may also respond
to skill ratios so we use expenditure on fuel and rent of power (in some years it is a single
category while in others, it was decomposed) as an alternative measure of capital which may
capture more utilization than purchase of capital. Again, since that variable is only available
from 1890 onwards, we used micro-data from Atack and Bateman (1999) to determine that few
firms devoted large amounts to fuel and power in 1860 and we thus proxy it with 0.1 for all
industries and counties in that year.
From 1890 onwards, we can also distinguish between wage earners and salaried officials,
something that we will use to proxy for production and non-production workers, following
Goldin and Katz (1998). We use IPUMS data to estimate φH = 0.85, the fraction of workers in
manufacturing that were literate. From there, we can impute production shares, s L and s H , by
allocating the wage-bill of each worker type (production/nonproduction) to literate and illiterate
26 Home

industries, which may have been important in these early years, were not included; there was also a sales
threshold for inclusion.
27 Industries were matched by hand by the authors, aggregating where necessary to create consistency over time.
Census reports were used from 1900 onwards where merging and disaggregation were detailed. For periods previous
to that, some comparative tables were used as a guide. Details are provided in the Data Appendix.

this does little to alter the results of our “late” period but does allow us to estimate a parameter for the
“early” period which is why we chose to make this assumption.
30 Including

workers according to their representation in each type. This is likely a lower-bound estimate of
s H since it assumes no return to skill within production or non-production workers. We obtain
estimates of s L = 0.0787 and s H = 0.5085, implying that the capital share was around 40 percent,
consistent with Taylor and Williamson (1997).
We restrict our sample of analysis to any county that was included in Census of Manufactures
tabulations over this period in at least three different years. In the aggregate analysis, we include
all industries for a given city/county. In the industry by area analysis, we exclude the residual
“All other industries” cells, as they are not comparable across years or areas and also exclude
industry-year cells where the industry appeared in no more than 2 areas in that year.31 Merged
all together, we obtain a very rich panel including 37,278 industry-city-year observations. This
includes a total 175 areas (more in some years than in others) and 137 industries (our classification
over time generated 150 separate industries but 13 of them were eliminated due to the fact that
they had too few observations in a given year –see Data Appendix for a list). These areas cover on
average 58 percent of the U.S. immigrant population, and the industry division is very detailed.
The means of our sample are shown in Table 1 in which we present the two different distinctions we will make between early and late period. In the first panel, we call “early” 1860-1880
and the rest as late. In the second panel, we move our window by 10 years, implying that all
observations from the 19th century are called “early”. What we can observe is that there is capital
deepening over the full period, as can be seen from the change in values as we alter the cut-off
points. Literacy in the US was also relatively high over this period with the logarithm of skilled
per unskilled worker of around 2 in the 19th century and growing to about 3 in the early 20th
century (implying a change from about 80 percent of the workers being literate to almost everybody being literate by 1930). Our predicted measure seems to be slightly lower than the actual
one, suggesting that endogenous migration exacerbated existing differences.

Results

5.1

First stage

Our identification strategy relies on the impact regional clustering of immigrants has on skill
ratios as the origin composition of immigrants shifts over time, an approach which has seen a lot
of use in modern studies of the labor market impact of immigration. To demonstrate visually how
the instrument functions, we present, in Figure 1, the actual and instrumented skill ratio for two
cities in our sample: Chicago and New Orleans. Chicago was particularly receiving immigrants
of German origin and New Orleans, of Italian and Russian origins. Since German immigrants
were very highly literate but that their flow stopped by about 1910, Chicago is predicted to have
31 The

latter is essential to the construction of our standard errors.

15

first an increase in its literacy rate and then a slowdown by the later part of our sample. New
Orleans, on the other hand, received migrants that had lower levels of literacy, particularly after
1880, and thus faced a decrease in its skill ratio right until immigration slowdowns in 1930. The
predictions generated by our instruments are indicative of the trends we find in the actual data.
Appendix Table B.1 shows the first stage regressions estimated in the industry x county
level data combining all years of data. To both account for the fact there are multiple “copies” of
county within a year and for the fact that the errors are likely autocorrelated over time, we cluster
standard errors by county. In addition, we weight by the inverse of the number of industries
represented in a county (to give each county equal weight).32 As we move from column (1) to (3),
we explore increasingly demanding controls for industry, which will parallel our analysis below:
with no industry effects, with industry effects, and with industry x year effects. In Appendix
Table B.1, the only reason they should make any difference is because of small changes in the
composition of areas which identify the relationship (since the instrument and skill mix measure
do not vary by industry). The results suggest that these added controls change little the first
stage which remains very highly significant and almost unmoved in terms of magnitude. The
results suggest that a change in 1 percent in our predict skill ratio translates into about a 0.75
percent change in the actual skill ratio of a county. This could be consistent with endogenous
location choice by natives and immigrants, some deterioration of the settlement patterns from
historical patterns, or both.
Recall that our skill ratio will be interacted with a period-indicator for “early” or “late”. Thus,
we will not only have one first stage but two first stages for each of these interactions. However,
Wooldridge (1997) suggests that it is more efficient not to interact the instrument with such an
indicator variable but instead to use the first stage we presented in Appendix Table B.1, obtain
the predicted values and interact them with our indicator dummies. We do this and obtain a very
strong first stage for each sub-period of analysis as can be seen in Table 2. Skill mix tends to load
onto the instrument from the appropriate period, and the confidence interval usually includes
one. We do find that the period with most immigration (“early”) also seems to have a stronger
first stage than the “late” one.

5.2

Responses of capital

Having shown that our instrument is capable of generating significant variation in the endogenous variable, we now turn to exploring how capital intensity responded to the change in the
skill ratio generated by immigration. Table 3 shows results at the “aggregate” level, that is using
only variation across areas, not accounting for potential differences in industry mix. Columns
(1) and (3) examine capital per worker and columns (2) and (4) capital per dollar of output. The

standard errors are larger if we do not make this weighting adjustment, but the F-stat remains above 10.

first two columns present the OLS while the last two show the IV estimates. OLS seems to show
limited responses of capital ratios to change in skill ratios: there is a positive correlation between
capital intensity and skill ratio in the “early” period and a negative but not significant correlation in the “late”. The IV estimates, on the other hand, suggest that capital per worker positively
responded to an immigration-induced increase in skill ratios in both “late” periods. The impact
for the early part of the sample is positive but not significantly different from zero. The impact
on capital-output ratios, on the other hand, is negative and significant for the “early” period
and positive and significant for the “late” period when we use 1880 as the last year of the early
period. From these aggregate results, we would thus conclude that capital-skill complementarity
strengthened over the period and that capital and low-skill workers were q-complements in the
early part of our sample.
A concern with results in Table 3 is that they are potentially driven by shifts in industry mix:
that is, more less skilled workers may attract less capital intensive industries (e.g., Goldin and
Katz, 1998; James and Skinner, 1985) and this would alter capital ratios. To address this, we
now turn to estimates that allow us to examine within industry responses to aggregate skill mix
changes, using our data on production techniques detailed by area and industry.
Table 4 shows ordinary least squares (OLS), and Table 5 shows instrumental variables (IV)
estimates of the relationship between skill mix and capital measures at the industry x area level.
The first 3 columns of each table focus on the capital per worker while the last 3 columns present
the results for the capital-output ratios. The panels are organized as previously depending on the
moment in which our sample is split between “early” and “late” periods. For each outcome and
period, we successively increase the number of fixed effects, starting from none, to fixed effects
for industries and finally for industry-year fixed effects.
We first consider the results of the OLS regressions in Table 4. We find that an increase in
skill mix is positively associated with capital per worker measure throughout the period and
relatively similarly in magnitude between the late and early periods. Capital per output is also
positively associated with an increase in the skill ratio but less so than for capital per worker.
Let us now consider the IV estimates in Table 5. In that case, we tend to observe a negative
impact of skill ratio on capital per worker and capital per output in the early period for both
cut-offs, particularly significant for capital-output. The results for capital-output are robust to
the inclusion of various fixed-effects but those for capital per worker lose their significance once
larger sets of fixed effects are introduced. In the later period, we find some weak evidence that the
skill-ratio increased significantly the capital per worker, result that is not robust to the inclusion
of multiple fixed effects. From the model, this suggests that capital-skill complementarity used
to be much weaker in the “early” period than in the late period. Using our framework, this
would imply that in the early period, capital was relatively more complementary with low- than
high-skill workers, but its relative complementary with low-skilled workers fell (and its relative
17

complementarity with skilled labor increased) as time passed. As we will discover below, the
magnitudes of the positive coefficient in the “late” period may even suggest that capital and
low-skill workers became q-substitutes.
Our estimates were, in some cases, sensitive to industry mix controls. In the appendix we ask
directly if industry mix responds to changes in skill ratios in Table B.2, and find that it largely
does not.
Thus, while the statistical significance of some late period results is weaker than one would
hope, the magnitudes are clearly suggestive of a change in the relationship of capital with skilled
and unskilled labor as time went by. This is consistent with what some historians have previously argued, that in the nineteenth century capital was a relative substitute of skilled labor,
and became a relative complement of skilled labor only some time later in the nineteenth or
early twentieth century. The argument is that early factories were low-skill and capital-intensive
relative to the alternative, artisanal production. In light of this, it is interesting that we do not
find a significant association between skill supplies and establishment size in the early period
(See results in Table B.3).33 While not entirely ruling out that capital’s response is due to a shift
between “modes” of production, this is not consistent with the being driven by shift between
artisanal and factory production. Another way to see it as providing reassurance that results are
really being driven by changes in production technique, as, for example, Katz and Margo (2013)
argue establishment size can significantly confound estimates of the changes in capital usage.
OLS estimates would have not been able to tell us this as they implied that capital-skill complementary was present since the beginning although maybe increasing over time. A standard
story would be that OLS estimates are attenuated by measurement error. This seems a plausible contributor to bias in this context, with a crude self-reported measure of skill conditional
on a large number of fixed effects. However, there may also be other sources of bias. A key
unobservable might be the local outside (non-manufacturing) option of low-skill workers. For
instance, to take a Goldin and Sokoloff (1984) type of story, certain areas may have very productive agricultural land. In such areas, low-skill workers might drawn to the area but away from
manufacturing, which could reduce the adoption of capital- and low skill-intensive production
techniques.
One may be worried that our measure of the value of capital may not be as close as to what
we wish to measure since it includes land and buildings. We thus turn to our two alternative
measures of capital, namely horsepower (which in some years is predicted from value of machinery and equipment) and fuel expenditures and rent of power. These two measures are only
available from 1890 on but we extrapolated their value for 1860 as well. However, since our
instrument requires at least 2 years within each sub-period, this implies that we cannot get an

contrasts with Kim (2007), who finds an association between immigration, not parameterized by skill, and
plant size.

18

estimate of the causal effect of a change in the skill ratio when the early period only includes
1860-1880. Thus, Table 6 includes only one panel instead of two for that reason. The format of the
table mirrors that of the previous one except that for each outcome, we now have two different
measures. Columns (1)-(3) and (7)-(9) measure capital from fuel expenditure and the others from
horsepower and its proxy. A difference to keep in mind between this table and the previous one
is that we have limited information in the “early” period –it is essentially an 1890 cross section–
thus limiting our capacity to make comparisons. This may explain why in this table, we do not
estimate a significant negative coefficient as we found previously for the “early” period. For both
measures, we find strong, positive and robust effects of the skill ratio on capital per worker in
the late period, suggesting that the exogenous arrival of more skilled workers increased the use
of these measures of capital. The results for capital-output ratios are also positive.
If we use our theoretical framework, we would again draw a similar analysis than before:
fuel expenditures and horsepower became more and more complementary to high-skill workers
around the turn of the twentieth century. There is some indication that both these measures
of capital had similar cross-partials with high-skill than low-skill workers in the early period
of analysis but that the relationship between these form of capital and literate workers became
much more complementary as time went by.
Conducting our analysis separately may be penalizing us since we are estimating the same
fundamental relationship using two different capital-ratios. If we assume that our framework
is correct, then we can combine the two equations to potentially improve the precisions of our
estimates. One can note from our theoretical framework that

This system is over-identified as there are two equations and one unknown parameter, which
is κ. Formally, we can estimate a system of two equations given by:
ln(K/N ) + φ ln( H/L) = β(ln( H/L))
ln(K/Y ) + s H ln( H/L) = β((s L + s H ) ln( H/L))
and impose that the coefficients β, which is an estimate of κ, be identical in both equations.

κ measures absolute q-complementarity between capital and skills. To interpret it, recall
∂ln(K/Y )
∂ln( H/L)

> 0 defines what is often called capital-skill complementarity (e.g., Goldin
and Katz, 1998; Krusell et al., 2000), a condition under which capital proportionately raises the
marginal product of skilled labor more than unskilled. From above, the two are related by
−s H + (s L + s H )κ > 0, or κ > s Ls+Hs H . Thus, this joint estimation of κ allows us to draw simple
conclusions about the relationship between inputs:
from (5), that

• If κ < 0, then capital and skills are q-substitutes and capital and low-skill are q-complements
• If

sH
s L +s H

> κ > 0, then capital and both types of labor are q-complements with capital but
capital is more complementary to low-skill labor than high-skill labor

• If 1 > κ >

sH
s L +s H ,

then capital and both types of labor are q-complements with capital but

capital is more complementary to high-skill labor than low-skill labor
• If κ > 1, then capital and high-skill labor are q-complements and capital and low-skill labor
are q-substitutes
Recall in section 4 we calculated that s L = 0.0787 and s H = 0.5085, which produces a cutoff of
sH
s L +s H

= 0.866. We perform this estimation and report the results in Table 7 where we report
a different estimate of κ for early and late periods using two different cut-offs in each panel, as
before. The first three columns use our regressions of the value of capital, the next three our fuel
expenditures and the last three, our horsepower measure. For each of these outcomes, we also
explore the impact of controlling for fixed effects.
about

We can see that we do gain some statistical power by imposing some structure on our estimates. We can now argue that capital increased the marginal productivity of low-skill labor in the
early period when using the value of capital or fuel expenditures as our measure of K. Our measure of κ is statistically larger than 0 in all cases and for capital and fuel expenditures, it is also
less than 1. It is also smaller than 0.866, although not statistically so. This would suggest that for
the early period, capital was q-complements of both types of labor but capital was slightly more
complementary to low-skill than to high-skill labor. For 1890-1930, we find a κ which is slightly
larger than one, implying that capital would have not altered the marginal productivity of lowskill workers or if anything, may have lowered it. When we divide our late period to include only
1900-1930, we find even larger values for κ, suggesting that capital became q-substitute to lowskill labor around 1900. For horsepower, we see a very similar pattern when we do not include
fixed effects by industry but these are not robust to the inclusion of additional controls. Once
we include industry-time fixed effects, we would argue that horsepower was q-complement with
both types of labor and more complementary to high-skill than low-skill workers but this would
not be different in either period. This may be because horsepower measures a type of capital that

20

is exactly the core of the Second Industrial Revolution and thus would not experience this break
over time as other types of capital we presented.
Overall, these “structural” results suggest that capital and high-skill labor (as measured by
literacy) have been consistently q-complementary in manufacturing since at least the 1860 but
that this relationship was strengthened substantially around 1890-1900 when, in some of our
estimates, it became so complementary that low-skill workers became substitutes for capital. This
also seems to vary by type of capital where technologies using horsepower appear to have been
more complementary with high-skill workers than other types of capital. Furthermore, we have
explored how sensitive our results are to our assumptions and have found little reason to believe
that the results we present would look different if we had used the estimates of parameters for
any other years.34 In particular, given that the share accrued to low-skill workers was shrinking
over time, the results we present are potentially an understatement in terms of the change we
measure in κ.

Parametric Specifications, Calibration and Simulation

Having estimated that the relationship between capital and skill has strongly changed over our
period of study and being limited by data to study directly the wage effects of the policies, we
now take a more parametric specification to explore how this changing relationship may have
affected how the US economy was able to absorb changes in skill mix generated by migration.

6.1

Setup

In order to simulate the wage and capital accumulation impacts of immigration, we turn to a
parametric form for our single-good model of production in section 2. Capital-skill complementarity is generally modeled using a nested CES structure, which can either group together capital
and skilled labor (e.g., Goldin and Katz, 1998; Krusell et al., 2000), or capital and unskilled labor
(e.g., Autor et al., 2003; Lewis, 2011) in the inner nest. For example, the general form of the
production function used in Goldin and Katz (1998) is

1/ρ
Y = A α( βK θ + (1 − β) H θ )ρ/θ + (1 − α) Lρ
,

(11)

where ρ > θ implies capital is more complementary with high- than low-skill labor (ρ < θ implies the opposite). Goldin and Katz (1998) model the shift between different manufacturing
production technologies – from hand production, to factory and assembly line and later to continuous and batch processes – as shifts in the parameters A, α, and β over time. Alternatively,

Y = A α( βK θ + (1 − β) Lθ )ρ/θ + (1 − α) H ρ

(12)

The only difference from (11) is in the position of H and L. In (12), θ > ρ instead implies
relative capital-skill complementarity. Since there is not consensus on the “right” way to nest the
production function, we will try it both ways, and see which fits the data better. Under (11):
κ=

(1 − ρ ) s L (1 − s L )
(1 − ρ ) s L (1 − s L − s H ) + (1 − θ ) s H

(13)

κ=

−(1 − ρ)s L s H + (1 − θ )s L
(1 − ρ ) s H (1 − s L − s H ) + (1 − θ ) s L

(14)

while under (12)

On top of this, we can show that the wage impact will depend on κ such that
d ln(WH /WL )
(ρ − θ )(1 − s L − s H )(−κ )
= ρ−1+
d ln( H/L)
1 − sL

(16)

under (11) and

under (12). Again, when capital is more complementary to skills the second term is positive. So
like in section 2, the magnitude of the relative wage response to changes in skill mix is smaller
than predicted by the short-run inverse elasticity of substitution (that is, ρ − 1 < 0). The appendix
provides all the demonstration of the above equations.

6.2

Parameter Values

To estimate the impact on wages, we must first estimate (13) and (14). We have estimates of s L
and s H described earlier (in section 4) as well as κ for different periods of our data but we do
not have parameter estimates of ρ or θ. Obtaining estimates of ρ is especially problematic due to
a lack of disaggregated wage data, which means we do not have good, direct estimates of (15)
and (16). To deal with this, we will assume different values of the parameter ρ, where (1 − ρ)−1
represents the short-run elasticity of substitution between high and low-skill labor (and, as a
check, we will compare our simulations to estimates in Goldin (1994) below). We will then set
θ to be consistent with our estimates of (13) and (14), subject to assumed values of capital and
skilled labor’s share.
22

To see this, Table 8 maps out the parameter estimates and relative wage impact of a one unit
change in ln( H/L) implied by various assumed parameter estimates, using, alternatively, model
(12) (in columns 4-5) or model (11).35 The top panel assumes, as Goldin and Katz (1998) did, that
the outer nest is Cobb-Douglas (ρ = 0). As a benchmark, we will start by assuming that capital
is not more or less complementary to skill, i.e. is “skill neutral,” by setting θ = ρ = 0, shown in
row 1. This implies that relative wages fall one-for-one as skill ratios rise. (More generally, the
relative wage impact of a one unit increase in ln( H/L) is given by ρ − 1 in the skill neutral case
θ = ρ – see (15) and (16)).
Next, let us turn to choosing parameters consistent with our estimate of κ for 1860-80 of 0.7,
shown in row 2 of the table. This implies a negative value of θ = −0.85 when capital is nested
with unskilled labor and a positive value of θ = 0.58 when capital is nested with skilled labor.
In both cases, this implies that capital is q-complementary with both skilled and unskilled labor
but more so with unskilled than skilled labor. In the capital-unskilled nesting, wage impacts are
larger than the capital neutral benchmark in row (1), as capital adjustments magnify the relative
productivity impact of changes in skill supply. This does not happen here when capital is nested
with skilled labor.
In contrast, as noted in section 2, if the response of capital output ratios to skill mix is positive
(and so κ> s Ls+Hs H ≈ 0.866) –so that capital and skill are relative complements – then the relative
wage impacts are smaller than the benchmark case. Our estimate of κ = 1.1 for 1890-1930
from Table 7 implies the impossible θ > 1 when capital is nested with skilled labor, which
casts some doubt on the appropriateness of this nesting. However, when we nest capital with
unskilled labor, row 3 of Table 8 shows we obtain a large positive estimate of θ = 0.77 that
is in the admissible range below one. In that case, the impact of the change in skill ratio on
the relative wage is strongly attenuated by the response of capital, with magnitudes about one
third that of the “skill-neutral” benchmark case in the table’s first row. Interestingly in modern
data and using a similar approach, Lewis (2011) estimates a κ only slightly more positive (albeit
for different skill categories, high school dropouts and completers) than the one we obtain for
the “late period,” potentially consistent with Goldin and Katz (1998)’s argument that modern
capital-skill complementarity is a continuation of similar relationship between labor and nonlabor inputs in this earlier era. Rows 4 and 5 show that larger estimates of κ would imply even
smaller wage impacts (such as the extreme case of Autor et al., 2003).
How sensitive are these relationships to different parameter choices? The pattern of relative
magnitudes are not sensitive to the choice of our least well justified parameter ρ, the one which
governs the elasticity of substitution between skill types. For example, the bottom panel shows
the same set of simulations with instead ρ set at 0.33, which is roughly what you would need
to get to the consensus value for the elasticity of substitution between college and non-college
35 This

is generalized from a similar table in Lewis (2013).

labor in the modern U.S. labor market (e.g., Hamermesh, 1993). The absolute wage impacts are
smaller in this panel (by design of the larger elasticity), but the proportional difference across
rows varies in nearly the same way as the upper panel (for example, the estimates in row 8
are about one-third those of row 6). The estimated wage impact would also be even smaller if,
realistically, the capital or skill share were even larger in the later period.36
Interestingly, the estimates in the lower panel of Table 8 are also roughly in line with the
reduced form elasticity of substitution between artisans and laborers implied by estimates in
Goldin (1994), whose estimates come from the middle of our period of study.37 Given the large
differences in methodology, perhaps not too much should be made of this; nevertheless, because of this similarity, the estimates in the lower panel will be used to simulate the impact of
counterfactual immigration flows in the next section.

6.3

Simulating the Impact of Immigration

The one unit increase in ln( H/L) used in the Table 8 simulations may not be typical of the
impact of immigration. So now we turn to simulations based on the actual experience of the
U.S. economy with immigration during the period of our estimates. Table 9 shows estimates
of the impact of immigration on wage ratios in manufacturing under various counterfactual
immigration scenarios, using the estimated capital responses from the period under study to
generate the parameter values, under the continuing assumptions that ρ = 0.33, s L = 0.08, and
s H = 0.51. Since nesting capital and unskilled labor seems to fit the data better, we will focus on
simulations using that nesting.
Panel A of Table 9 simulates the impact of net immigration between 1860 and 1880 using
the production function we estimated for that period. Comparing the “actual” to counterfactual
ratios of literate to non-literate population, columns 1 and 2 reveal that absent of net immigration in this period, skill ratios would actually have been about 8 percent lower.38 During this

estimated from the Census of Population to estimate the regression ∆ ln woc = a + bo ∆Fc + µc , where ∆ ln woc is the ln
change in the wage in occupation o and city c and ∆Fc is the change in the share foreign-born in the city. Her estimates
tend to be more negative for laborers than artisans, consistent with a relative wage impact of an increase in the relative
supply of less-skilled labor induced by immigration. To convert her estimates to a reduced-form relative wage impact

relative to laborers, p = HH
+ L represents the share “skilled” (artisan), and p F , and p D represent the share skilled for
foreigners and domestic workers, respectively. In the upper panel of Goldin (1994)’s table 7.8, bartisans − blaborers ranges
from 0.481 to 1.465 depending on time period. (Caveats: each of bartisans and blaborers was estimated in a different
sample of cities; the estimates are also possibly confounded by the direct compositional impacts of immigration.) If
p is 0.9 (the non-laborer share in manufacturing and construction in 1900) and p F − p D is about -0.2 (the gap in this
share between immigrants who arrived in the 1890s and natives) then the reduced form relative wage impact will be
in the range of -.66 to -0.22, which overlaps with the wage impacts in rows 6-9 of the lower panel of Table 8.
38 This calculation is made imposing that the same number of literate and illiterate immigrants present in the U.S.

24

era – at least nationally – immigrants had higher literacy rates than natives. According to the
parameterization in Table 8 row 7, column 5, removing immigrants who came between 1860 and
1880 would have raised skilled relative wages by about 8 percent, which is equivalent to saying
net immigration during that era raised unskilled wages by roughly 8 percent. Capital intensity
was also rising during this era, and our complementarity estimates suggest this also would have
raised unskilled relative wages. Thus both immigration and technological change during this era
likely had the effect of compressing the wage distribution of natives.
The remaining rows of Table 9 examines what would have happened if the U.S. Congress had
succeeded in passing a literacy test in 1897.39 This is done under under two different scenarios:
first, using the production function we estimated for 1890-30 in the aggregate (panel B); and
second, using the production function we estimated for 1860-80 (panel C). The panel C asks,
therefore, what would the impact of the wave of southern and eastern European immigration
have been if the production technology had not changed?
To implement this simulation, we drop from the census of population sample (Ruggles et
al., 2010) any illiterate immigrants who arrived after 1897, and compute the counterfactual skill
ratios. Column (2) of Table 9 shows that this raises skill ratios over time, by 1920 substantially,
about 35 percent. To do the middle panel simulations, we take the wage elasticity in row 8 of
Table 8. Column (4) shows that the literacy test might have lowered skilled relative wages by 7
percent; put differently, the illiterate arrivals who stayed in the U.S. after 1897 appear to have
lowered unskilled relative wages by 7 percent. This is quite a modest wage impact given the
magnitude of arrivals over this period and the related outcry. The adverse labor market impacts
of immigration thus may have been a weak justification for the ultimate passage of a literacy
test in 1917, although the sensitivity analysis in the previous section suggests the wage impacts
might have been larger than this. However, even these alternatives are quite modest compared
to what the relative wage impact would have been true had the production technology in use in
the early twentieth century remained the same as it had been 1860-80: using that wage elasticity,
the relative wage impacts would have been over 30 percent. Thus, the new role of capital in
production may have played an important role in the absorbtion of large waves of immigrants at
the turn of the twentieth century.
We would like to test this more directly by estimating how much immigration-induced
changes in the skill ratio affected relative wages in manufacturing. Measuring relative wages
directly is challenging, however, as individual-level wage data are not available until 1940 in
IPUMS. Wage data by “skill” – salaried officials and wage workers – only becomes available in
the Census of Manufactures starting in 1890. Thus, at best we are only able to analyze the “late”
in 1860 would have been present in 1880 and native skill mix would have remained the same.
39 Goldin (1994) investigates the history of attempts to pass immigration restrictions in the U.S. According to her
research, 1897 was the first credible attempt to impose a literacy test. In that year, a bill made it through Congress but
was vetoed by President Cleveland.

25

period. We have used these data to construct a crude proxy for the relative wage of literate workers (by assuming, as above, that within production category there is no return to literacy). Using
this proxy, we estimate that changes in skill ratios have a small, positive and not significant effect
on wage ratios in all specifications.40 This may be because the approximation of the wage ratio
is just too crude and may be confounded by compositional changes in who makes up salaried
officials and wage workers as literacy rates change. However, they are also consistent with the
effect of the skill ratio on wages being muted by changes in capital-ratios.

Conclusions

Our analysis suggests that immigration between 1860 and 1930 was a sufficiently important
shock to the local labor force to alter skill ratios in urban counties. It also suggests that manfacturing capital intensity responded to immigration-induced changes in skill ratios (a relationship
which holds within industry).41 The estimated responses support the notion that capital relatively substituted for skilled labor in in nineteenth century manufacturing. This appears to have
dramatically changed around the turn of the century, when low-skill workers became substitutes
for capital and ushering in the level of capital-skill complementarity we see in modern times.
This shift appears to coincide with the Second Industrial Revolution suggesting that something
in that new way of production altered the relationship between capital and skill.
Our analysis potentially suffers from several limitations. First, we have examined a very crude
measure of skill composition based on literacy. Not only might this not be a very relevant skill
margin – especially towards the end of our period – but it may obscure more subtle relationship
between skills and technology, such as the notion that technological advance throughout this
period were raising demand for skills as the “poles” of the skill distribution relative to the middle
(including Gray, 2013; Katz and Margo, 2013). Some these changes may have taken place outside
of the manufacturing sector, the only sector we have data on in this study. Our measure of capital
stocks is also very broad, though the same is true of many of the existing U.S. historical studies
on manufacturing; we attempted to address this with alternative proxies for machinery use.
We are also only able to directly estimate relative wage impacts using a crude proxy for
relative wages; these estimates show little impact. However, simulations based on fitting our estimates to a parametric production function suggest that the small wage impacts we do find are
consistent with the adjustments in capital-intensity that we observe. These simulations suggest
the importance of the early twentieth century production technology in allowing the U.S. economy to absorb the wave of southern and eastern European migrants with only a modest decline

in less-skilled wages. This was possible because the production technology allowed a sufficient
rate of substitution away from capital (at a fixed rental rate) in response to the less-skilled labor
shock. Under the older production technology in which capital complemented low-skill labor,
this would not have been possible. This historical context thus reveals that the way in which
non-labor inputs adjust to labor mix shocks can play a critical role in the economy’s ability to
adapt to such shocks.

Outcome is ln(literate/not literate) in the age 15+ population from IPUMS, except 1890,
which uses published tabulations of the age 10+ population of the area. X̂ represents the
predicted value of this of this ln skill ratio based on the average relationship between it
and the instruments, which apportions immigrants to counties by country of birth (and
natives by state of birth) based on their locations in an earlier base year (1850 or 1880) –
see text and table B.1. Standard errors in parentheses, calculated to be robust to arbitrary
error correlation with area. Sample is restricted to industry-years where at least 2 cities
in that year reported a given industry. N=37,278. Significance levels: * 10%, ** 5%, ***1%.

Notes: a Simulated impact of a one unit increase in ln( H/L), where H represents skilled (literate) and L unskilled (illiterate)
labor, on the returns to literacy (skilled-unskilled log wage gap) in a competitive single-good economy represented by the
production function (12) in column (5) and (11) in column (7), where K represent capital. This impact is approximated
as (16) in column (5) and (15) in column (7) where s L represents low-skill and s H skilled labor’s share of output, and κ
represents the relative cross partial of low-skill labor, estimated in table 7. b Estimates of κ from Table 7 are converted to an
estimate of θ (for the given value of ρ, s H and s L ) using (14) when capital is nested with unskilled labor and (13) when capital
is nested with skilled labor. c Lewis estimates dln(K/Y )/d( L/H ) = −0.56, (with L, H high school dropouts and completers,
respectively) which evaluated at the mean L/H of 0.3 (in Lewis’s sample) converts to an elasticity of about ε = 0.17, which
is converted to an estimate of κ using that κ = −(ε − s L )/(s L + s H ). d κ > 1 is not feasible under this parameterization, as it
would require θ > 1.

B.2

Alternative adjustment mechanisms

Our estimates were, in some cases, sensitive to industry mix controls. So we now directly explore
whether the change in skill availability within an area altered the industry mix. The difference
between our aggregate results and our industry-level results may indicate that there is some
change by industry mix but it is difficult to quantify it. We present, in Table B.2, the IV estimates
of a regression of the share of low-skill workers employed in each quartile of the distribution of
44

firms on the skill ratio in the area. Since these regressions are run by area and not by industry,
they only include area and year fixed effects as those in Table 3. To measure industry shift,
we need to divide our industries in categories as running the share of each industry separately
would be too lengthy and difficult to interpret. As a first approximation, we separated industries
based on their capital/labor and literate/non-literate workers ratios at the national level in the
first year that variable was provided in the data (namely 1860 for K/N and 1890 for H/L).42 .
We find no strong evidence indicating that the aggregate skills ratio influenced significantly
industry composition and the allocation of low-skill workers to different industries. We find
only one significant coefficient which suggests that industries in the second quartile of the H/L
distribution expanded more in the 1860-1890 period in response to an increase in the local H/L
ratio, at the expense of all other quartiles.
Combining these with the difference in factor intensity of each industry, we find very limited
evidence overall that these shifts allowed the economy to absorb the area-level shift in skills
availability. What we do here is we multiply the response in terms of size of industry by the
factor-ratio in each of these quantiles and sum them up. By dividing that sum by the average
factor ratio in the economy, we then obtain what is the change in percent that would have been
generated through shifts of industries alone. We find that in all periods, except 1860-1880, taking
the coefficients as face value, the change in industry composition would have actually lowered the
capital per worker in each county. The estimates range from 5 percent decrease in 1860-1890 to 28
percent decrease in 1890-1930. In 1860-1880, the results would suggest an increase of 17 percent.
Given that, if anything, the results we obtain here go in the opposite direction as our estimated
impacts at the disaggregated results, this suggest limited role for industry-shift responses. These
are simply averages and given the fact that none of the coefficients are significant, should not be
perceived as in any way precise. Nevertheless, they suggest little role for the pattern we observe
in aggregate to be driven by shifts across industries.
The results for the skill ratio are all extremely small, suggesting that the manufacturing sector
did not absorb the change in skill ratios by altering its industry mix. Furthermore, we do not
see much evidence of a change as time goes by suggesting that we cannot justify the pattern we
identify as time passes.
Overall, these results seem to suggest little role for within-manufacturing sectoral reallocations in response to the skill shock. Finally, while not reported here, we also find that areas which
experienced an increase in their skill ratio over the later period did observe a lower growth in
manufacturing employment than other areas and the coefficient for the earlier period is positive
and not significant.43

and modern production rather than artisan installations. Our instrumental variable estimates
suggest that the effect of the skill ratio is more positive in the second half, but none of our
estimates is statistically different from 0.44

Robustness checks for simulations

In the simulations in section 6, the estimates of s H and s L used were calculated from aggregate
data assuming that within occupational groups, there are no “return” to literacy, that is, within
each of production and non-production status that each worker received the same wage. In
fact, to the best of our ability to measure it, the “return” to literacy, that is ln(w H /w L ) may
have been around 50% over most of the years of our sample. We estimated this using the Iowa

Population (Ruggles et al., 2010), using 1950 “occupation score” (that is, the mean wages in the
person’s reported occupation in the 1950 census). We limited to the sample to urban native-born
who are at least age 20. Figure B.1 shows our estimates of the return to literacy by year.45

not that different than what we are using. The results for our estimates of κ are robust to these

Imputed Capital Stock

Table C.4 shows the availability of variables in the manufacturing census tabulations by year. Not
all variables are tabulated in all available years (even if they were in the underlying surveys). For
example, data on capital stocks has always been collected, but was never tabulated after 1920.
Employment and value added are always available.
To extend our main outcome to 1930, we used the 1910-1920 samples to run a regression of
ln(Capital) on ln(Horsepower), controlling for year, area, and industry effects. From these estimates we imputed that ln(\
capital ) = 0.77839346 ∗ ln( Horsepower ). The relationship between

horsepower and capital is very strong; the predicted values from 1910 and 1920 from this regression are quite close to the actual values.
Recall that we also examine horsepower variable directly. It represents the horsepower of
rated machinery, which is likely closer to the capital variable of interest in terms of replacing
manual labor. Unfortunately, the tabulated series on this is quite short, running just 1910-1930.
To extend the series backwards, we would like to use the closest variable to it, the value of
machinery, which was tabulated 1890 and 1900. So, unfortunately, there is no overlap in the
city-level tabulations of these variables from which to do the imputations. To address this, we
turn to a 1900 state level (aggregate) tabulation which included both the value of machinery and
\ = 0.004 ∗ Machinery,
horsepower. The relationship between these two at this level is horsepower
which was applied to the 1890 and 1900 data to extend the horsepower variable back to 1890.
We also examine fuel expenditures as a third outcome. In each case, the regression outcome
variable is the natural log of the capital variable divided by either the number of workers or value
added. Horsepower and fuel expenditures only begin in 1890. To get some kind of estimates for
the “early” period using these variables, we essentially put in blank cells for 1860 (and just
for 1860: there remains no data for 1870 or 1880 in the regressions which use these variables).
Specifically, we enter 0.1 for the value of horsepower and fuel expenditures in all 1860 cells. This
is motivated by the microdata available for 1860 suggest that fuel expenditures and machinery
horsepower in this era was trivial – see Atack and Bateman (1999) for a description of these
microdata.

Industries were matched across census tabulations using tabulated crosswalks in years in after

Right Hand Side Variables

For most census years, literacy rates and associated variables come from IPUMS microdata (Ruggles et al., 2010). However, no microdata exist for 1890. To address this, we entered the 1890
census tabulations of the size of the literate and total population by city and state (page lvi and
xxxiii, respectively of U.S. Department of Interior, United States Census Office, 1897). For areas
not covered by the list of tabulated cities, we use the state residual literacy rate. That is, we take
the state totals and subtract off the totals in all of the cities we observe, and assign the residual
literacy rate to each of the counties we do not have data on.
U.S. Department of Interior, United States Census Office (1897) is also the source for the
number of foreign-born by country of origin in 1890, used in the construction of the instrument
(page lxxii). The instrument relies on the interaction of county shares by origin in a base year –
we use 1850 and 1880 – and the national stocks of by origin and literacy. The stocks and literacy
rates of each origin group – with U.S. natives shown for comparison is shown in Table C.6. (The
table is in descending order of the simple average of the size of the group across all years in the
data.) The instrument uses the separate national stocks of literate and illiterates by origin, which
91

can be calculated from the product of the literacy rates (or 1-literacy rate for illiterate stock) and
the total stock shown above. The stocks in the 1890 table we use are not broken out by literacy,
so we impute the literacy rate in 1890 of each origin group by taking the average of the 1880 and
1900 observed rates of literacy for each origin group (shown in Table C.6).
In the actual construction of the instrument, natives are further subdivided into their “origins”
– states of birth (not shown in table). The size of the native literate and illiterate population from
each state of birth is imputed as the average of the 1880 and 1900 values.
