Incentive Effects of Price Rises and Payment-System
Changes on Chinese Agricultural Productivity Growth

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the relative importance of the major factors
underlying the post—1978 increase in China's agricultural productivity. We
present a method for assessing the role of price increases and strengthened
individual incentives due to the introduction of the responsibility system.
Data on pre- and post—1978 Chinese agricultural performance are used to
calculate incentive indices, giving the fraction of their marginal product
that peasants received under the pre-1978 regime.

Introduction
Between 1978 and 1984 output in the Chinese agricultural sector

increased by over 50 percent (Johnson 1985). These impressive output gains
followed the adoption of a system stressing individual responsibility in place

of a system of communal decision—making and rewards. The ongoing economic
reform in China has attracted much attention in the West, in part because it
represents a major social experiment in the design of institutions in which a
system emphasizing ideology and social sanctions has been replaced by a system

relying more heavily on economic incentives. However, not all the increase in
Chinese agricultural output can be attributed to systemic changes, because at
the same time, the prices of agricultural outputs and the use of inputs such
as chemical fertilizers were increased.'
This paper presents a method for decomposing the productivity increase
in Chinese agriculture in the post—1978 period into that part attributable to
price increases and that part which reflects the effects of strengthened

individual incentives under the new institutional structure. Our method
combines standard growth—accounting techniques with a simple model of
peasants' rational response to the institution within which they work.
Subject to caveats both about the special functional forms assumed in our
calculations and the shortcomings of the available data, we suggest that

three—quarters of the 37 percent increase in agricultural productivity in
China between 1978 and 1984 can be attributed to the incentive effects of the

new responsibility system and one—quarter to higher prices. We also obtain a
measure of the extent to which individual incentives operated under pre—1978

communal system: our calculations suggest that it was as if peasants

2

were paid one-third of their marginal value product. As a result, we estimate
that the effective quality of labor under the commune system was about 60 per
cent of that under the responsibility system.

These findings have wider implications than simply providing an

understanding of performance in Chinese agriculture. Much of modern
microeconomic theory focuses on the design of institutions;2 and Chinese

policy is an experiment in institutional design on a huge scale. In the
theorists' analyses, it is individuals' self—interested responses which

constrain institutional design. In this paper, we use the results of the
Chinese experiment to estimate empirically the force of incentive

constraints. Our results suggest that rewarding individual effort yields
large benefits. Hence, for other countries where communal methods have been
tried and agricultural performance has been poor (such as Tanzania), these
results suggest that prices and institutions need to be considered together as

explanations of performance. The results also suggest that significant
further gains could be achieved by comparable reforms in the Chinese
industrial sector, allowing pice incentives to operate more freely than has
hitherto been the case.

In Section 2 we briefly describe Chinese agricultural arrangements

before and after 1978. Section 3 presents the theory underlying our
decomposition method for estimating the relative importance of institutional

changes and price changes for economic performance. Section 4 presents data
on total factor productivity changes, our decomposition, and estimated

incentive indices. Section 5 offers a conclusion.

2.

Institutional Arrangements in Chinese Agriculture
A typical Chinese rural commune in 1978 consisted of three units:

the

commune, the production brigade, and the production team. The production team
was the basic accounting and production—organizing unit. It owned virtually

all the land, draft animals and farm machinery it used. Each team was given
annual production targets (conveyed through the commune and brigade). It then
drew up its annual production plan, deciding how to use its land, manpower,

animals, and farm tools; when to plow and plant, and what types of fertilizer

to use for which kinds of crops. All peasants, including women and children,
were included in the team's labor plan.
There were two principal methods of allocating work among team members;

assigning work on a daily basis, or assigning long—term fixed work. In grain
production and other major farm tasks, work was assigned to work groups on a

rotating basis. For other tasks, work was given to small groups of peasants
who often retained a permanent responsibility for the job.
Each production team distributed income among team members largely
according to an estimate of each member's labor contribution to production.

Under the "labor—day—work—payment" system, the quantity of work done was

measured in terms of labor days. For each day, those who presented themselves
in the field would receive a labor day. The quality of work done was measured
by work points received per labor day. Members of teams were classified into
different grades according to their technical skills, capacity to work, and

how well they met the labor norms set up by the team. Different numbers of
work points were attached to each grade. Members periodically assessed each
other's work and determined the grade each should be classified into, and thus
the number of work points each should earn for labor days worked during the

period of assessment. In this assessment process, team staff (team leaders
and heads of work groups) played the main role.

4

At the end of the agricultural year, the combined income of the team was
divided by the sum

of

work points credited to all team members to determine

the value of one work point. The disposable income of each member was
determined by multiplying by the number of work points the individual peasant
had accumulated over the agricultural year.3
At the end of 1978, the Chinese central government decided to introduce
major reform in agriculture in large part because of poor agricultural growth

performance over the preceding 20 year period. A "production responsibility
system" was introduced to deal with the problems of shirking and mismanagement

associated with the previous communal system. Under this, the individual
peasant, rather than the production team, became the basic unit for

decision—making in Chinese agriculture. Most aspects of collective management
have since been abandoned, with only land ownership remaining within the

collective (Lardy (1986a, 1986b), Watson (1984)). Introduction of this system
began in 1979, and by the end of 1983 more than 90 percent of farm families
operated under the responsibility system (Crook (1985)).

The responsibility system involves contracts signed between the
production team and each household, which regulate the taxes and delivery
quotas payable to the state and the welfare funds and investment funds payable

to the team. Any production above the delivery quota is retained by the
household who can sell it and receive the proceeds. Most restrictions on
production activities on private plots have been removed and the size of
private plots has increased.

5

The earlier grain self—sufficiency policy, which required each region to

be self—sufficient in grain production, has also been abandoned. Peasants in
each region are now allowed to specialize in planting these crops most
suitable to their land, rainfall, temperature, and other environmental

characteristics. The number of planned product categories and obligatory
targets has been sharply reduced. In addition, control over collective
production activities have been relaxed and production teams can organize any
non—farm production as they see fit.
In addition to these changes, reforms in agricultural prices have

occurred. Since 1979, state procurement prices have increased for most major
farm products. Grain procurement prices have increased by 20 percent for
compulsory delivery quotas, and the additional price premium for above-quota
sales has been raised from 30 percent to 50 percent (Kueh, 1984).

Furthermore, any extra grain produced can be sold at prices reflecting
conditions in the open market, and substantial procurement price increases for

other farm products have occurred. Comparable procurement and premium prices
for cotton have been raised by 15 percent and 30 percent, respectively, and
compulsory delivery prices for edible oil and pork have been increased by 25

percent (Kueb, 1984). Prices of tobacco, vegetables and soy beans have also
been raised (Walker, 1984), and prices of some manufactured goods supplied to
the agricultural sector have been reduced.

3.

Decomposing the Effects of Price Increases and Changes in the
Incentive System
The net effect of all these changes has been a sharp increase in output

in Chinese agriculture.4 However, assessing their importance of each is
difficult because they have occurred largely simultaneously. While it has
been the systemic changes involving the responsibility system which have
attracted most attention, thus far it has not been clear what portion of the
output gain to attribute to them, given the price increases.

6

Our procedure to make such a decomposition is based on growth—accounting
techniques associated with Dennison (1967) and Solow (1957), but goes further
in also incorporating behavioral responses of agricultural workers to changes

in both the incentive system and prices. Since we seek an
empirically—implementable model, we assume special functional forms in our
analysis.

We assume that a peasant can choose the efficiency with which he works.
If L represents the total number of peasants and c is the effort of a typical
worker, the contribution of labor to output measured in efficiency units is

Lc. This approach to representing the labor input in agricultural production
is similar to that underlined Stiglitz's (1976) efficiency—wage hypothesis:
but unlike Stiglitz, we model the individual's optimizing choice of effort.

Although we describe c as "effort", it should be interpreted broadly, to

include everything that determines the effective quality of labor: c might
be increased not only by inducing the workers literally to exert more effort,

but also by encouraging the use of entrepreneurial talent, or by removing
restrictions on the kinds of tasks a worker may undertake and thereby allowing
labor to flow to its most productive uses.

We assume a Cobb—Douglas agricultural production function, given by

a 1-a
1

Q = a (cL) K
0

1
,

(1)

where Q and K represent total output and aggregate non-labor inputs (capital,
land, pesticides, fertilizer, etc.) respectively, and a1 defines the share

parameters on factor inputs (0 < a1 < 1). The quantity produced by a
representative peasant is thus

7

a
1

q=ac
k
0

1

(2)

,

where q and k represent output per peasant and capital per peasant
respectively.

We suppose that each peasant receives an income which depends on his
productivity and is given by

y=13pq+c,

(3)

where p is the price at which additional output is sold; q is the quantity of
output produced by the peasant; 13

is

the fraction of the additional revenue

generated that the peasant is allowed to keep; and c is a constant term.

Under the post—1979 responsibility system, c is negative (representing
the output quota that the peasant must deliver to the government) and

=1

13

(the peasant keeps the proceeds of sales of output beyond his quota).5

Under

the pre—1979 communal system, c is positive (the payment received by the

peasant regardless of his own effort) and 0 <

13

<

1,

since peasants were

typically not fully rewarded for effort at the margin, due to the reward

structure in the commune. A commonly—made observation is that managerial
difficulties in operating the communes gave rise to "the problem that
individuals (in the commune) could see little connection between effort

expended and what they received as income" (Macrae (1977, p. 371)). It was
difficult to measure an individual's effort accurately; and to some extent the
distribution of rewards within the commune was based on egalitarian criteria:

Johnson (1985), Watson (1984). But priori, our analysis does not rule out the
possibility that those problems were overcome by the commune managers, i.e.
13 =

1.

While equation (3) does not fully model all the complexities of

8

payment under the work—points system, it nonetheless captures its main

features.6 The parameter

is an index of the strength of the incentives

offered to peasants: it measures the peasant's perception of what fraction of
his marginal value product he would be paid.

We also assume that peasants receive utility from income but dislike

effort. We capture this in the simple utility function
z

U(y,c)

C

=

y

—

—
z6

(4)

where 6 > 0 and z > 1 are constants. This function implies that the

marginal disutility of effort, c1/6, increases with effort. Without this
property, there would be a corner solution for the optimal effort level from

peasant optimizing behavior. The work—disutility coefficient z is such that
2
2
c3 u/ac

z—l =

(5)

.

au/ac

Thus, analogous to the coefficient of relative risk aversion, z measures the

curvature of the utility function. The utility function (4) also implies that
the disutility of effort is independent of income level.

We now consider the peasant's optimizing choice of effort. Substitution
of (2) and (3) into (4) and optimization with respect to c implies that the

optimal effort c satisfies
= [6a

(6)

10

Substitution of this into the per—worker production function (2) gives
q =

0[6a10 3p]

1/(z_a1)kz(l_cl)/(z_l)

(7)

9

Finally, multiplication of both sides by L to revert to aggregate variables
implies

We label (8) the "institutional" production function to distinguish it from

"technical" production function (1). The difference is that while (1)
reflects technical (that is, biological and physical) relationships between
inputs and outputs, (8) also incorporates the peasants' response to the

institutional arrangements within which they work.7
We note that the institutional production function (8) is expressed in
terms of the observable labor input L rather than the unobservable efficiency

measure of labor cL, as in the technical production function. It is (8)
rather than (1) that would be estimated by the conventional
aggregate-production--function estimation; and the estimated factor shares

would be

and 2' rather than those of the technical production

relationship,

and

A would be the term estimated as total factor

productivity.

The parameters ct, l' and

are technologically determined, and 6

and z are taste parameters: all are invariant to the institutional form. The
two policy variables are the output price, p. and the share of the peasant's
marginal output that he retains, f3.

The sole effect of a change in either or

both of these policy variables is to change the coefficient A in the

institutional production function (8). We can thus assess the effect of
changes in 3 (as through the introduction of the responsibility system) on

10

agricultural productivity for unchanged agricultural prices, and the effect of
changes in prices for unchanged 3, and in this way separate the two effects
in which we are interested.

Using the subscripts i and j to denote parameter and policy variables
for different years, (9) implies

Given price indices p. and p.,, total—factor—productivity estimates A. and A.,,

the labor—share exponent in production

and an estimate of the

work—disutility parameter z, we can use (10) to compute the ratio of the
incentive indices 13.113.. Since 13. = 1 for marginal production under the
1

13

responsibility system, we can estimate f3. under the commune system. And
having estimated f3./f3.,, we can compute

which is what the ratio of total factor productivities would have been if
there had been no price changes; that is p. = p1.

Thus (11) provides an

estimate of the extent to which observed productivity increases were caused by
the incentive effect of the institutional changes alone.

Finally, from (6) and the fact that

showing the effective quality of labor in year i relative to year j, as a
function of the institutional arrangements (the 13. and 13.) and prices.

Our model ignores the possibility that the introduction of the
responsibility system may have affected not only the quality of labor, but
also the effective quality of land, especially to the extent that
decentralized decision—making results in a better matching of crops to land.
Also, the opening of new markets, by creating new gains from trade, may have

caused productivity growth. And, if technical progress occurs, total factor

productivity would increase (via a rise in the parameter a). Thus, to the
extent that any of these effects is at work, our model will overestimate the
relative efficiency of the responsibility system compared to the communal.

4.

Measuring Incentive Effects
Equations (8) and (9) above imply that the effect of a change in the

institutional incentive system is to change the measured total factor
productivity, A.

If we denote the responsibility system and the commune

system by subscripts i and j, respectively, then the ratio A./A. is equal to
the ratio of outputs under the two institutional arrangements for any given

input vector. It thus provides a measure of the productivity gain
attributable to the strengthened incentives under the responsibility system
and/or the increases in agricultural prices.

12

To provide some background to our computations of post—1978 productivity

changes, Table 1 presents data on inputs and outputs for 1952 to 1977. In
1952 land redistribution had been accomplished and
own

land:

the

peasants farmed their

a market system operated. From the time of the collectivization,

1953, to the end of the Cultural Revolution the annual change in total factor

productivity was negative almost as often as it was positive. Productivity
fell drastically during the Great Leap Forward (see the 1959 and 1960

estimates) and during the Cultural Revolution (in particular in 1968). Only
in three years (1955, 1957, and 1958) was total factor productivity as high as

it had been in 1952. By 1961, after the Great Leap Forward, total factor
productivity was 74 percent of what it had been in 1952; and by 1977, it was
90 percent of the 1952 level.

Table 2 shows that the post—1978 situation has been strikingly

different, (Tables 1 and 2 are presented separately because the input and
output data series are noncomparable.7) In 1978 agricultural prices began to
increase; and through the early 1980s the production responsibility system was

introduced. These changes have resulted in successive increases in total
factor productivity, except for a slight, transitional decline in 1979—1980.
From equation (9), changes in 13 affect the productivity parameter A in

exactly the same way as changes in p: the incentive structure and prices are
perfect substitutes. However, prices are available in the data, whereas 13's

are not. Using equation (10), we can estimate the ratio of incentive indices
in different years, 13./IL. These incentive—index estimates use the
total—factor—productivity estimates from Table 2, price indices, and the

reported in the last column of Table 2. The labor—share parameter we take to
be 0.50, following Tang (1980).8 We need also the unobservable parameter z,
which measures the curvature of the utility function. The only theoretical
restriction is that it must exceed one. Although not directly observable, z
can be calculated indirectly. Between 1978 and 1979, there were substantial
agricultural price increases (of 22 percent), but little change in the commune
system (Watson, 1984, p. 90). Assuming that from 1978 to 1979 13 was

unchanged, we can from (10) infer the value of z. This we compute to be
3.448, and we use this value for z in our other computations.
Table 3 reports estimates of the incentive—index ratio 13.113. in the
first row.

If we presume that 13 = 1 in 1984 (peasants receive their full

marginal value product under the responsibility system), then the 1984
estimate in Table 3 implies that in 1978 13 was 0.30. In the commune system
as it was organized at the end of the Cultural Revolution, it was as if an
individual worker was paid just under one—third of his marginal value product.
Using equation (11) and the f3/13, estimates, we can also deduce the

incentive effects of the introduction of the responsibility system alone. The
results are also reported in Table 3. We calculate that if there had been no
price increase between 1978 and 1984, total factor productivity would have
increased by 27.55 percent, compared with the 37.00 percent that it actually

increased. This implies that 75 percent of the productivity gain in Chinese
agriculture between 1978 and 1984 can be attributed to the strengthened
individual incentives generated by the new institutions, and the remaining 25
percent to the price increases.9

Finally, using equation (12) to compute c1978/c1984, we find that the
effective quality of labor in 1978 was about 60 per cent of what it became in
1984.

Since f3 is calculated as a residual, it is sensitive to changes in

parameters. The least reliable of our parameter estimates is the

utility—function curvature parameter z. The z estimate we use is 3.448. If

instead z were 2.0, we would have estimated l9781984 to be 0.76; this
would have attributed 40 percent of the productivity gain to the changed

incentive scheme. If z were 3.0, these estimates would have been 0.41 and 69
percent respectively. If z were 4.0, they would have been 0.22 and 79
percent. Thus our estimates are sensitive to changes in the estimate of z;
but over a wide range of z values our model attributes most of the
productivity increase to the changed incentive structure.

Conclusion
This paper presents a method for assessing the relative importance of

price increases and strengthened individual incentives for increased
agricultural performance in China following the economic reforms introduced in

1978. We employ a production—function approach in which optimizing effort of
peasants is captured: peasant supply of effort increases as either the prices
of agricultural products or the fraction of their value marginal product they

receive increase. Subject to caveats about the structure of our theoretical
model and the shortcomings of the data, our results suggest that one—quarter

18

of the increase in productivity in Chinese agriculture between 1978 and 1984
was due to higher prices, and three—quarters to changes in the incentive

scheme. We estimate that the incentive effect of the change from the pre—1978
communal system to the post—1978 responsibility system resulted in a 28 per
cent increase in total factor productivity in agriculture.

1Lardy (l986b) remarks that "The simultaneous implementation of so many
reforms makes it difficult, if not impossible, to measure the relative

importance of each of these changes. If the individual elements of the reform
had been implemented separately, their individual contribution to the
acceleration of agricultural growth might have been measured."

Hart and Holmstrom (1986), and McAfee and McMillan (1987).

3The foregoing description of the commune system closely follows Cheng

(1982). Commune members were also allowed to farm small plots of land for
personal use. (In pastoral areas, they were also allowed to keep a limited
number of livestock.) In most areas, 5 percent of the arable land was
allocated for private plots. Peasants used private plots for fruits,

vegetables, tobacco and produce for feeding chickens and pigs. Peasants were
permitted, under some restrictions, to engage in sideline production such as

weaving, knitting, gathering medical herbs, and handicrafts. Peasants could
trade their produce from private plots and sideline occupations through a farm

market, but this was subject to strict government regulation. Transactions
were conducted mainly between commune members, and public agencies and

enterprises were not permitted to trade in this market. Peasants were not
allowed to go to urban areas and sell their products to urban residents.

4The average output of a rural worker rose 54.2 percent between 1980 and

1984. In that period, per—worker production of grain rose 24 percent; of
cotton, 124 percent; of oilseeds, 50 percent; and of meat, 24 percent (Xinhua,
22 Sept. 1985).

5However, if next year's quota (c in equation (3)) depends upon this
year's output, then the peasant's incentive to produce this year is reduced,
effectively making 13 less than 1 under the responsibility system. See
Freixas, Guesnerie, and Tirole (1985).

6For a more detailed model of the operation of the work—points system,
see Lin (1986a).

7The input data used in the total—factor-productivity computations of
Table 2 are subject to problems not easily overcome except by detailed

analysis of the type Tang performed on the pre-1977 data. Only
chemical—fertilizer inputs are measured, not natural—fertilizer inputs; and
capital should include draft animals, whereas here it is only machinery.

Since the omitted inputs are the more traditional inputs, the data probably
overstate the growth rate of inputs and so underestimate the growth rate of
total factor productivity.

8Tang based his factor—share estimates on income share in 1952, when
incomes were determined by competitive market forces.

91n a complementary analysis, Lin (1986b) used the fact that the
responsibility system was introduced gradually between 1980 and 1983, at
different rates in different provinces, to estimate the incentive effects.

Lin found that about 50 percent of the output growth between 1980 and 1983 was

attributable to the responsibility system. (Our estimate that the
responsibility system accounted for 75 percent of the growth in total factor
productivity implies that it accounted for about 40 percent of the growth in
output.)
