ABSTRACT
A widely held view is that openness to international trade leads to higher GDP volatility, as trade increases
specialization and hence exposure to sector-specific shocks. We revisit the common wisdom and argue
that when country-wide shocks are important, openness to international trade can lower GDP volatility
by reducing exposure to domestic shocks and allowing countries to diversify the sources of demand
and supply across countries. Using a quantitative model of trade, we assess the importance of the two
mechanisms (sectoral specialization and cross-country diversification) and provide a new answer to
the question of whether and how international trade affects economic volatility.

Introduction

An important question at the crossroads of macro-development and international economics
is whether and how openness to trade a¤ects macroeconomic volatility. A widely held view in
academic and policy discussions, which can be traced back at least to Newbery and Stiglitz
(1984), is that openness to international trade leads to higher GDP volatility. The origins
of this view are rooted in a large class of theories of international trade predicting that
openness to trade increases specialization. Because specialization (or lack of diversi…cation)
in production tends to increase a country’s exposure to shocks speci…c to the sectors (or
range of products) in which the country specializes, it is generally inferred that trade increases volatility. This view seems present in policy circles, where trade openness is often
perceived as posing a trade-o¤ between the …rst and second moments (i.e., trade causes
higher productivity at the cost of higher volatility).1
This paper revisits the common wisdom on two conceptual grounds. First, the paper
points out that the existing wisdom is strongly predicated on the assumption that sectorspeci…c shocks (hitting a particular sector) are the dominant source of GDP volatility. The
evidence, however does not support this assumption. Indeed, country-speci…c shocks (shocks
common to all sectors in a given country) are at least as important as sector-speci…c shocks in
shaping countries’volatility patterns (e.g. Koren and Tenreyro, 2007). The …rst contribution
of this paper is to show analytically that when country-speci…c shocks are an important
source of volatility, openness to international trade can lower GDP volatility. In particular,
openness reduces a country’s exposure to domestic shocks, and allows it to diversify its

analytical paper” (2011), prepared by the U.K. Department of International Development.

sources of demand and supply, leading to potentially lower overall volatility. This is true as
long as the volatility of shocks a¤ecting trading partners are not too big, or the covariance
of shocks across countries is not too large. In other words, we show that the sign and size of
the e¤ect of openness on volatility depends on the variances and covariances of shocks across
countries.
The paper furthermore questions the mechanical assumption that higher sectoral specialization per se leads to higher volatility. Indeed, whether GDP volatility increases or decreases
with specialization depends on the intrinsic volatility of the sectors in which the economy
specializes in, as well as on the covariance among sectoral shocks and between sectoral and
country-wide shocks.
We make these points in the context of a quantitative, multi-sector, stochastic model of
trade and GDP determination. The model builds on a variation of Eaton and Kortum (2002),
Alvarez and Lucas (2006), and Caliendo and Parro (2012), augmented to allow for countryspeci…c, and sector-speci…c shocks. In each sector, production combines equipped labour with
a variety of tradable inputs. Producers source tradable inputs from the lowest-cost supplier
(where supply costs depend on the supplier’s productivity as well as trade costs), after
productivity shocks have been realized. This generates the potential for trade to “insure”
against shocks, as producers can redirect input demand to countries experiencing positive
supply shocks. However, (equipped) labor must be allocated to sectors before productivity
shocks are realized. This friction allows us to capture the traditional specialization channel,
because it reduces a country’s ability to respond to sectoral shocks by reallocating resources
to other sectors.
We use the model in conjunction with sector-level production and bilateral trade data
3

for a diverse group of countries to quantitatively assess how changes in trading costs since
the early 1970s have a¤ected GDP volatility.2 The quantitative exercise uses as inputs the
stochastic properties of country-speci…c sectoral productivity shocks, which we back out from
the model on the basis of sector-level data on gross output, value added, and bilateral trade
‡ows data. To assess the e¤ect of changes in trade barriers since the 1970s we also back out
country-and-sector speci…c paths of trade costs.
We …nd that the decline in trade costs since the 1970s has caused sizeable reductions in
GDP volatility in two-thirds of the countries in our sample, while it led to modest increases
in volatility in the other third. The range of changes in volatility varies signi…cantly across
countries, with Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium-Luxembourg, and Norway experiencing
the largest reductions in volatility and Greece and Italy experiencing the biggest increases.
The general decline in volatility due to trade is the net result of the two di¤erent mechanisms
discussed above, sectoral specialization, and country-wide diversi…cation. The country-wide
diversi…cation mechanism contributed to lower volatility in 90 percent of the countries in
our sample, indeed suggesting that there is scope for diversi…cation through trade. Equally
interestingly, and against conventional wisdom, higher sectoral specialization does not always
lead to higher volatility: Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, India, the Netherlands, Norway,
South Korea, and Sweden, all experienced a decline in volatility due to the trade-induced
change in sectoral specialization. For three-quarters of the countries, however, the sectoralspecialization channel contributed to increase volatility. As with the overall net e¤ect of
trade on volatility, the relative importance of the two mechanisms we highlight varies across

the factors underlying the …nancial crisis.

countries, though the e¤ect of the specialization mechanism is on average smaller than the
e¤ect of the diversi…cation mechanism.
To summarize, our study challenges the standard view that trade increases volatility.
It highlights a new mechanism (country diversi…cation) whereby trade can lower volatility.
It also shows that the standard mechanism of sectoral specialization— usually deemed to
increase volatility— can in certain circumstances lead to lower volatility. The analysis indicates that diversi…cation of country-speci…c shocks has generally led to lower volatility during
the period we analyze, and has been quantitatively more important than the specialization
mechanism.
As the model and quantitative results illustrate, openness to trade does not always causes
an unambiguous e¤ect on volatility: the sign and size of the e¤ect varies across countries.
This result might partly explain why direct empirical evidence on the e¤ect of openness on
volatility has yielded mixed results. Some studies …nd that trade decreases volatility (e.g.,
Cavallo, 2008, Strotmann, Döpke, and Buch, 2006, Burgess and Donaldson, 2015, Parinduri,
2011), while others …nd that trade increases it (e.g., Rodrik, 1998, Easterly, Islam, and
Stiglitz, 2000, Kose, Prasad, and Terrones, 2003, and di Giovanni and Levchenko, 2009).
The model-based analysis can circumvent the problem of causal identi…cation faced by many
empirical studies, allowing for counterfactual exercises that isolate the e¤ect of trade costs
on volatility. Moreover, it can cope with highly heterogenous trade e¤ects across countries.
Before proceeding, we should emphasize that we focus the analysis on GDP volatility
because for most countries in the world, GDP and consumption ‡uctuations are almost
perfectly correlated. Hence, accounting for GDP volatility goes a long way in accounting

5

for consumption volatility (see Figures 1 and 2).3 Accordingly, in the modeling section, we
abstract from …nancial trade in assets.4
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the literature.
Section III presents the model and solves analytically for two special cases, autarky and
costless free trade. Section IV introduces the data, calibration, and quantitative results.
Section V presents concluding remarks. The Appendix contains further derivations and a
detailed description of the datasets used in the paper.

aggregate consumption and GDP.

There is an obvious analogy between diversi…cation through trade in goods and diversi…cation through
trade in …nancial assets. However, trade in assets stabilizes consumption, not GDP (indeed, trade in assets
might increase GDP volatility, as capital would tend to ‡ow to high productivity countries and amplify
productivity shocks), whereas in contrast, trade in goods stabilizes GDP— and as a by-product, also consumption. Given the patterns in Figure 1, there appears to be limited asset diversi…cation across countries.

Literature Review

A number of empirical studies have exploited variation across countries to study the e¤ects
of trade openness on volatility. Some studies, most notably Rodrik (1998), Easterly, Islam,
and Stiglitz (2000), Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2003) …nd that trade openness increases
volatility, while others, including Haddad, Lim and Saborowski (2010), Cavallo (2008), and
Bejan (2006) …nd that trade openness decreases volatility. Di Giovanni and Levchenko
exploit variation across countries and across sectors, concluding that trade openness leads
to higher volatility. Strotmann, Döpke, and Buch (2006) exploit variation across …rms in

7

Germany and infer that exposure to international trade increases …rm-level and aggregate
volatility. While the use of sector- or …rm-level data allows researchers to control for a
number of country-speci…c determinants of volatility, omitted-variable biases at lower levels
of aggregation, reverse causality, and possibly heterogenous e¤ects of trade openness across
countries remain important concerns.5
To understand the causal e¤ect of trade openness on volatility, we build on a variation of
the theoretical model formulated by Eaton and Kortum (2002), further extended by Alvarez
and Lucas (2006) and Caliendo and Parro (2012). The model is amenable to quantitative
calibration and has proven useful at replicating trade ‡ows and production patterns across
countries. Variations of this model have been used to address a number of questions in
international economics— questions related to the e¤ects of trade on the “…rst moments”of
domestic or foreign productivity, but not the trade e¤ects on countries’aggregate volatility.
For example, Hsieh and Ossa (2011) study the spillover e¤ects of China’s growth on other
countries; di Giovanni, Levchenko, and Zhang (2014) study the global welfare impact of
China’s trade integration and technological change; Levchenko and Zhang (2013) investigate
the impact of trade with emerging countries on labour markets; Burstein and Vogel (2012)
and Parro (2013) study the e¤ect of international trade on the skill premium; Caliendo,
Rossi-Hansberg, Parro, and Sarte (2013) study the impact of regional productivity changes
on the U.S. economy, and so on. None of these applications, however, focuses on the impact
of openness to trade on volatility. The closest paper to ours, both on question and modelling framework, is Burgess and Donaldson (2012), who use the Eaton-Kortum model in
5

Trade is by no means the only determinant of volatility. For studies of other determinants of volatility,
see Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2003), Raddatz (2006), Koren and Tenreyro (2007, 2011, 2013), Berrie,
Bonomo and Carvalho (2013), and the references therein.

conjunction with data on the expansion of railroads across regions in India to assess whether
real income became more or less sensitive to rainfall shocks, as India’s regions became more
open to trade. The authors …nd that the decline in transportation costs lowered the impact
of productivity shocks on real income, implying a reduction in volatility. Our analysis highlights that, while a reduction in volatility has been experienced by many countries as they
became more open to trade, the size and sign of the trade e¤ect on volatility may be— and
indeed has been— di¤erent across di¤erent countries.6;7
Our results also relate to Wacziarg and Wallack (2004), who empirically study 25 episodes
of trade liberalizations and …nd a relatively small extent of labour reallocation across sectors. Though the authors do not analyze volatility patterns, their results are consistent
with our …nding that, on average, the sectoral-specialization channel tends to be of limited
quantitative importance; our results, however, point out to signi…cant heterogeneity in the
e¤ects, indicating that the sectoral specialization channel played an important role in certain
countries, most notably Italy and the Netherlands.
Our paper is also related to the seminal contribution of Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland
(1992). The authors show that in a real-business-cycle setting, GDP volatility is higher in
the open economy than in the closed economy, as capital inputs are allocated to production
in the country with the most favorable technology shock. In other words, GDP ‡uctuations
are ampli…ed in an open economy. (In contrast, consumption volatility decreases in the
6

Though similar in question and modelling framework, the quantiative approach carried out in our paper
is very di¤erent from that adopted for India by Burgess and Donaldson (2012).
7
See also Donaldson (2015), where the question also is addressed in the context of India’s railroad expansion. There is also a growing literature on the e¤ect of globalization on income risk and inequality. We
do not focus on distributional e¤ects within countries in this paper, though it is obviously a very important
issue, and a natural next step in our research. For theoretical developments in that area, see for example,
Anderson (2011) and the references therein.

open economy, as …nancial markets allow countries to smooth the impact of GDP shocks on
consumption; this result generates a large cross-country correlation of consumption relative
to the cross-country correlation of output, which, as the authors point out, is not borne out
by the data.) In our multi-country, multi-sector setting, instead, GDP volatility can— and
often does— decrease with openness, as intra-temporal trade in inputs allows countries with
less favorable productivity shocks to source inputs from abroad, thus reducing GDP (as well
as consumption) volatility.8 Also related is the empirical literature initiated by Frankel and
Rose (1998), who documented a strong correlation between bilateral trade ‡ows and GDP
comovements between pairs of countries. Our main focus in this paper is on the causal e¤ect
of trade on volatility— and the channels mediating this e¤ect— but the quantitative approach
we follow in our counterfactual exercise can potentially be extended to also identify the causal
e¤ect of trade on bilateral comovement— and indeed, other higher-order moments. We keep
the focus on volatility, which is our main motivation, and speak to the perennial question of
how trade might a¤ect it.9
Readers of Kehoe and Ruhl (2008) may wonder whether changes in terms of trade caused
by (broadly construed) foreign productivity shocks a¤ect measured real GDP— and hence
real GDP volatility. In the Appendix we explain that this is indeed the case, given the way
in which statistical o¢ ces construct real GDP measures in practice.
8

A number of papers have tried to address the comovement “anomaly” pointed out by Backus, Kehoe,
and Kydland (1992), that is, the result that cross-country consumption correlations increase vis-à-vis cross
output correlations in the open economy; see, for example, Stockman and Tesar (1995). In this paper, we
focus on the e¤ect of trade on output volatility and refer readers interested in the comovement puzzle to the
complementary literature.

and Ramanarayanan (2008), and the references therein.

III

A Model of Trade with Stochastic Shocks

The baseline model builds on a multi-sector variation of Eaton and Kortum (2002), Alvarez
and Lucas (2006), and Caliendo and Parro (2012), augmented to allow for stochastic shocks,
as well as frictions to the allocation of non-produced (and non-traded) inputs across sectors.

A

Model Assumptions

The world economy is composed of N countries. At a given point in time t, each country n is
endowed with Lnt units of a primary (non produced) input, which we interpret as equipped
labour. There are J sectors (or broad classes of goods) in the economy, whose output is
combined into a …nal good through a Cobb-Douglas aggregate. In formulas, aggregate gross
output in the economy is given by:

Qnt =

J
Y

j

Qjnt

(1)

j=1

where Qjt is the gross output in sector j and

PJ

where qnt (! j ) is the quantity of good ! j used by country n in sector j at time t, and

> 0 is

the elasticity of substitution across goods within a given sector. The intermediate goods ! j
can be produced locally or imported from other countries. Delivering a good from country
n to country m in sector j and time period t results in 0 <

losses.10 Under the assumption of perfect competition, goods are sourced from the lowestcost producer, after adjusting for transport costs. The technology for producing qnt (! j ) is
given accordingly by the country of origin (m) with the lowest cost (with m = n when the
good is produced locally):

j

xmt (! j ) = Ajmt zm (! j )lmt (! j ) Mmt (! j )1

j

(3)

where xmt (! j ) is the production of good ! j by country m at time t, Mmt (! j ) is the amount
of the aggregate composite good used by country m to produce xmt (! j ) units of good ! j and
lmt (! j ) is the corresponding amount of equipped labour. Total factor productivity (TFP)
levels vary across countries, sectors, and goods. Speci…cally, each intermediate good ! j in
sector j of country n has a time-invariant idiosyncratic productivity factor zn (! j ) and a timevarying factor Ajnt common to all the goods ! j in sector j. Building on the literature, we
assume the productivities zn (! j ) follow a sector-speci…c, time-invariant Fréchet distribution
Fnj (z) = exp( Tnj z ). A higher Tnj shifts the distribution of productivities to the right,
that is leading to probabilistically higher productivities. A higher

decreases the dispersion

of the productivity distribution, and hence reduces the scope for comparative advantage.
Shocks to Ajnt over time are interpreted as standard sectoral total factor productivity (TFP)
shocks.
The single …nal good can be used both as input in the production of intermediaries ! j

In the calibration, the s will re‡ect all trading costs, including tari¤s; so implicitly we adopt the
extreme assumption that tari¤ revenues are wasted— or at least not rebated back to agents in a way that
would interact with the allocation of resources in the economy.

where lnt (! j ) denotes the amount of equipped labour used in the production of good ! j by
country n. The (equipped) labour allocated to each sector, Ljnt ; with

PJ

k=1

Lknt = Lnt , are

determined ex ante (before the realization of the shocks). Speci…cally, we assume there is
perfect risk-sharing within a country, but no risk-sharing across countries.11 At the beginning
of each period, a representative consumer decides on the optimal allocation of the primary
input Lnt into di¤erent sectors in order to maximize the expected value of utility; then
(stochastic) shocks to productivity Ajnt are realized, equipped labour is reallocated within
a sector (but not across sectors), and production and consumption take place. The lack of
ex-post reallocation across sectors in a given period aims at capturing the idea that in the
short run, it is costly to reallocate productive factors across sectors. Hence, ex post, Ljt is
…xed until t + 1:12
11

To motivate the lack of risk-sharing across countries, see our discussion of Figures 1 and 2.
In the quanti…cation, a period will be one year. This amounts to assuming that it takes at least one
year for resources to be reallocated across sectors.

is the discount factor. Because there is no intertemporal

trade and no capital in the economy, each period consumers maximize the expected static
utility ‡ow E [u (Cnt )] and the equilibrium is simply a sequence of static equilibria (in the
quantitative section, we allow for trade imbalances). In making his labor allocation decisions
the representative consumer takes into account the joint probability distribution function of
sectoral productivities, Ajnt s.
In the analysis, we assume log utility and therefore the consumer solves:

consumption in period t; thus, more resources are allocated to higher value-added sectors,
after appropriately weighting by marginal utility. Consider, for further intuition, a (small)
sector whose productivity is negatively correlated with the rest of the economy (that is, it has
high value added when the rest of the economy has low value added); in states of the world
in which overall income is low, the marginal utility of consumption 1=

Lnt will be

high and hence the optimal allocation entails allocating more resources to this sector. (Loglinearizing this expression makes the role of second moments on the allocation of resources

coe¢ cients

j

j

, as with Cobb-Douglas technology there is no variation on expenditures

(and sales) shares— and log-utility implies the shares determine the sectoral allocation of
resources. (In the open economy this result no longer holds as a country’s sectoral shares
depend on its absolute and comparative advantage as well as trading costs vis-à-vis other
countries.

Model Solution

We …rst discuss the solution under autarky, and then turn to the solution under free trade.

Solution under Autarky We solve the model backwards in two stages. First, we solve
the model taking the sectoral allocation of nonproduced inputs Ljt as …xed. We then solve
for the ex-ante optimal Lj0
t s before the shocks are realized. In the analysis of the autarky
case, we omit the country-speci…c subscripts n for convenience.

Equations (15)–(17) show the equilibrium prices as a function of technology and input
costs resulting from …rms’cost minimization and consumers’maximization problems. The
…rst equation in (18) shows the value of goods from sector j bought by country n from
country m as a share of total spending on goods j by country n: The second equation says
that the sum of spending shares on goods j from all countries m by country n (including n
itself) add to 1, that is, imports plus domestic expenditures on goods j by country n, add up
to the overall spending value on goods j by country n: Equation (19) gives the value of total

19

sales accruing to the primitive factor in sector j of country n; it already incorporates the
balanced trade condition, i.e., total payments for goods ‡owing out of country m to the rest
of the world equal payments ‡owing in country m from the rest of the world.14 Equation (18)
expresses total value added in the economy as the sum of sectoral value added. (Real value
added is given by Ynt =

wnt Lnt
.)
Pnt

Finally, (21) expresses the resource shares as a function of

expected shares, following the …rst order conditions in (5).
The model can conceptually be solved backwards in two steps. First, for any given set

Two Illustrative Cases: Autarky and Costless Trade

To illustrate the mechanism of diversi…cation through trade, we analyze a one-sector version
of the model (that is, the Eaton-Kortum model) under two extreme cases for which we have
closed-form analytical solutions for GDP: autarky and costless trade. We accordingly drop

Volatility under Autarky

Under complete autarky, value added in the one-sector economy is given by (13), which can
be rewritten as:

Y^nt =

Thus, in the one-sector economy under autarky, shocks to value added are driven exclusively
by domestic shocks to the productive capacity of the economy, Z^nt : The variance of GDP,
V (Y^nt ) thus depends on the variance of the shocks V (Z^nt ):

V (Y^nt ) =

smaller the impact of domestic volatility of shocks, Z^n ; on its GDP, when compared to
autarky. Openness to trade, however, exposes the economy to other countries’productivity
shocks, which will also contribute to the country’s overall volatility. Whether or not the
gain in diversi…cation (given by lower exposure to domestic productivity) is bigger than the
increased exposure to new shocks depends on the variance-covariance matrix of shocks across
countries. If all countries have the same constant variance V ar(Z^nt ) = ; and the Z^nt are

Mapping the Model into Observables

In this section, we connect the model to the data and use it to quantitatively assess the
e¤ect of historical changes in trade barriers on GDP volatility for a diverse sample of 24
core countries and an aggregate of the remaining countries to which we refer as “rest of the
world”(ROW).
The equilibrium of the model is characterized by equations (15)-(21). We solve the model
numerically, for which we need to calibrate the values of the exogenous trading costs

in the analysis (agriculture, 22 manufacturing sectors, and services). Throughout the study,
services are treated as a nontradable sector (that is,

j
nmt

= 0 for all n 6= m and

j
nmt

=1

for n = m), whereas agriculture and all manufacturing sectors are treated as tradables, with
potentially di¤erent trading costs.
We set

j

so as to match the average share of each sector on total …nal uses in the OECD

Input-Output tables across all countries. The betas for each sector are calculated as the
ratio of value added to total output. A detailed description of the data and the calculations
are available in the Appendix.
We allow for a relatively broad parametric range for , from

= 2 to

= 8; consistent

with the estimates in the literature (see Eaton and Kortum, 2003, Donaldson 2015, and
Simonovska and Waugh, 2011). We use

= 4 as the baseline case, and report the results

for other values when discussing the sensitivity of our results. We calibrate the elasticity of
substitution across varieties

= 2, consistent with Broda and Weinstein (2006). The results

are not sensitive to this parametric choice.
We explain next how we obtain the processes for

j
nmt

and Zitj using data on sectoral

bilateral trade ‡ows, value added, output, and prices. Before we specify the details, a
quick intuition on how these series are backed-out from the model is as follows. We recover
trade costs

j
nmt

using information on bilateral trade shares and gross output at the sectoral

level. Intuitively, if two countries trade little with one another in a given sector (relative to
the sectoral gross output of these countries), this will signal high trade costs between the
countries in that sector. Second, we recover productivities relative to a benchmark country
using the market share of each exporter. If a country has a high export share in a sector,
that is a sign of revealed comparative advantage, meaning a high relative productivity in the
24

sector relative to the benchmark country. To calibrate the absolute level of productivities,
we use price data for a benchmark country. We explain the procedure in detail and with
formulas in the next section.

A

Implementation

Kappas In order to perform counterfactual experiments we need to back out the historical
realizations of the exogenous processes. Following the idea in Head and Ries (2011), we
assume that sectoral bilateral trading costs are symmetric, that is:

j
nmt

=

j
mnt ,

and hence

bilateral trade costs at the sectoral level can be backed out from the data. Indeed, inverting
the structural model, we obtain:

djnmt djmnt
=
djmmt djnnt

2
j
nmt

:

(27)

The left hand side objects can be measured using data on bilateral imports and gross output
at the sectoral level. Speci…cally, djnmt is the value of exports from m to n in sector j at t
relative to total spending by n on sector j at time t, where total spending is measured as
gross output plus imports minus exports by that sector and country at time t: The share
djmmt is obtained as a residual from the accounting restriction:

djmmt

N
X

=1

djmnt

n6=m

Hence, for a given value of , we can obtain the time series of trading costs by sector and
country-pairs

j
nmt

.

25

Productivity in Tradable Sectors To back out the productivities, we proceed as follows.
First, using the formula for djnm in equation (18), after some algebra, we obtain:

To approximate terms on the right hand side we use data on sectoral import shares djnmt ,
j
sectoral value added ym

j

and aggregate prices Pnt along with the cal-

ibrated parameters. (See the Appendix for more details.) The only terms we cannot back
out directly from data are sectoral prices. We thus use the model in conjunction with the
data to infer them. Note …rst that equation (29) holds for all (n; k) pairs of countries and
all sectors j (except for services). The procedure becomes clear when we collect known and
unknown terms as follows:

can be decompose into two factors: a sectoral factor,

1
j

(39)

^ mt . The
A^jmt , and an aggregate factor L

interpretation of Lmt as “equipped labour”means that it embeds a productivity component
too. Given the functional form, the split between pure productivity and resources in Lmt
is not relevant from the point of view of aggregate volatility. (A shock to Lmt will be
0

equivalent to an aggregate shock to Ajmt s that leaves the relative productivities Ajmt =Ajmt
unchanged 8j; j 0 :) For identi…cation, we impose the restriction that
X

j

^j
j Amt

= 0:

(40)

Thus, changes in the sectoral productivity will correspond to changes in the relative value
of Ajmt , while changes in aggregate productivity (a¤ecting all sectors equally), as well as
changes in overall resources, will be subsumed in Lmt . We hence call sectoral shocks, those
^ mt . The identia¤ecting A^jmt and aggregate shocks those a¤ecting the aggregate factor L

Counterfactual Equilibria

identify the two theoretical mechanisms.

Numerical Counterfactual Equilibria For each new value of (inverse) trading cost ,
j
and the estimated sequence of sectoral productivities Zmt
, we need to solve for the sequence

of equipped labour allocated to each sector Ljmt . The rational-expectations equilibrium is
a …xed point of a below mapping on the space of all possible sequences Ljmt . We proceed
as follows.
1. We start from the initial value (Ljnt )0 =

2. In iteration i for the actual (Ljnt )i we get sectoral and aggregate (equipped labour)

wages, (wnt

Productivities in Counterfactual Scenario We are interested in decomposing the trade

to a factor model that decomposes productivity shocks into sector- and country-speci…c components in a way described in Koren and Tenreyro (2007). To separate per period shocks

Quantifying the E¤ect of Trade on Volatility

This section uses the framework developed above to quantitatively assess how historical
changes in trade costs from the early 1970s have a¤ected volatility patterns in a sample of
countries at di¤erent levels of development.
Trade barriers have declined signi…cantly since the early 1970s. This decline in barriers (or
increase in ) is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, which show, correspondingly, the histograms
of bilateral s in manufacturing and agriculture in the …rst and last year of our sample. As
the …gures show, the distribution of

has moved to the right, indicating a decline in trading

costs in both sectors.

in Manufacturing sectors. Years 1972 and 2007

33

Figure 4: Histogram of bilateral

in Agriculture. Years 1972 and 2007

Table 1 investigates how the changes in trading costs have a¤ected volatility in the 25
countries in our sample. (The list of countries can be seen in Table 1.) The results in
the table correspond to our benchmark calibration, based on

= 4: Column (1) in the

table shows the volatility generated by the model. Volatility is computed as the variance
of annual growth rates over 35 years (we focus on the variance rather than the standard
deviation, as the variance allows for an additive decomposition into the two mechanisms we
are interested in). The value reported in Column (1) is very close to the actual volatility
experienced by these economies from 1972 through 2007, since both the trading costs and
productivity processes fed into the model are backed out from the data. Column (2) shows
the volatility that would be observed if there were no global sectoral shocks. (The latter
is generally smaller than the benchmark volatility, though there are some exceptions, as
global sectoral shocks can covary negatively with country-speci…c shocks in some countries.)
To compute this counterfactual measure, we mute the global sector-speci…c shocks in the
j
decomposition of Z~nt
. (This measure of volatility is useful to identify and quantify the two

34

trade channels, as it will become clear next.) Column (3) shows the country’s volatility in
the counterfactual scenario that trading costs ( ) stayed at their 1972 levels. Column (4)
shows this latter measure in the absence of global sector-speci…c shocks.
Column (5) shows the percent change in average volatility due to actual changes in trading
costs since 1972, that is, the percent di¤erence between columns (1) and (3). Column
(6) shows the contribution of the specialization channel to the change in volatility in (5)
and Column (7) shows the corresponding contribution of the diversi…cation channel. The
contribution of diversi…cation to the change in volatility is computed as the di¤erence between
the volatility in the absence of sectoral shocks (Column 2) and the volatility under 1970’s
trading costs, in the absence of sectoral shocks (Column 4); the di¤erence is expressed relative
to the volatility under the 1972’s trading cost levels (Column 3). This measures captures
the trade in volatility due exclusively to the country-diversi…cation e¤ect, as the sectoral
shocks are muted. The volatility due to specialization is computed as the di¤erence between
Columns (5) and (7).
As Table 1 shows, two thirds of the countries in our sample experienced a decline in
volatility due to the decline in trade barriers since 1972, while the other third of the countries
experienced an increase in volatility. The biggest decreases in volatility caused by trade
occurred in Belgium-Luxemburg, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway, all of which saw
volatility reductions of over 90 percent, meaning their current volatility is 90 percent lower
than it would have been if trading costs stayed at their 1972 levels. The biggest increases in
volatility due to trade were witnessed by Greece (14 percent increase) and Italy (12 percent
increase). These results are the net e¤ect stemming from the contribution of the two separate
channels we study. The diversi…cation channel contributed to lower volatility in nearly 90
35

percent of the countries. The specialization channel contributed to increase volatility in twothirds of the countries, with the biggest increases experienced by Italy, Spain, the Netherlands
and Greece. In some countries, sectoral specialization actually contributed to lower volatility;
this is the case of Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, India, Norway, South Korea, and Sweden.
This is possible, as the model illustrates, when the sector (or sectors) in which the economy
specializes in comoves negatively (or less positively) with the country’s aggregate shocks— or
other sectoral shocks. Interestingly, the United Kingdom did not experience a sizeable change
in its volatility due to changes in trade costs. However, this result masks the contribution of
a sizeable reduction in volatility due to the diversi…cation channel and a comparably sizeable
increase in volatility due to the sectoral specialization channel.
In absolute terms, the diversi…cation e¤ect was in general larger than the specialization
e¤ect, and hence, on net, two-thirds of the countries saw a reduction in volatility, while the
remaining third saw a more modest increase in volatility. The heterogeneity in the trade
e¤ects across countries is remarkable.
Table 2 shows the change in volatility due to free trade and its decomposition for two other
(more extreme) values of ,

= 2 and

= 8: The general message is qualitatively robust: i)

the e¤ect of trade on volatility varies across countries; ii) the diversi…cation channel tends
to reduce volatility; and iii) sectoral specialization tends to increase volatility. Interestingly,
for

= 2, the case of high scope for comparative advantage, volatility always declines with

trading costs, with the declines being signi…cant even for countries like the United States.
The decline in volatility is driven almost exclusively by the large e¤ects stemming from the
country-wide diversi…cation channel. The e¤ects of sectoral specialization are also sizeable,
but smaller than the diversi…cation e¤ect. These results imply that, on average, trade leads
36

to a reduction in volatility. On the other extreme of

= 8, the results are qualitatively

similar to the benchmark case, although in general the results are quantitatively smaller.
Taken together, the …ndings appear robust to increases in

and suggest that the e¤ect of

country diversi…cation on volatility would be stronger for lower values of , meaning that
trade will reduce volatility even further as the scope for comparative advantage increases.
(This result holds despite the fact that sectoral specialization would also increase in this
case.)19

VI

Conclusions

How does openness to trade a¤ect GDP volatility? This paper revisits the common wisdom
that trade increases volatility by causing higher sectoral specialization. It argues that when
country-speci…c shocks are an important source of volatility, openness to international trade
can lower GDP volatility, as it reduces exposure to domestic shocks and allows countries to
diversify the sources of demand and supply across countries. Building on Eaton and Kortum
(2002)’s quanti…able model for trade, the paper assesses the e¤ect of trade on volatility and
the role played by these two mechanisms, sectoral specialization and country diversi…cation.
A key …nding of the paper is that the historical decline in trade barriers in agriculture and
manufacturing has led to a reduction in volatility in two-thirds of the countries analyzed, and
to modest increases in volatility in the remaining third. The quantitative change in volatility
varies signi…cantly across countries. The overall volatility change due to trade openness is
19

Our exercise underscores the importance of the parameter , and adds to the message of Arkolakis,
Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012): in order to assess the e¤ects of trade on key aggregate variables, the
elasticity of trade to trade costs plays a key role.

the net result of the two di¤erent mechanisms, sectoral specialization, and country-wise
diversi…cation. The …rst mechanism tends to decrease volatility, while the second tends to
increase it (though, as we point out, this general tendency …nds a number of exceptions).
The diversi…cation e¤ect is, on average, quantitatively stronger than the specialization e¤ect;
this result explains why, on average, volatility tends to decline with trade. The model sheds
light on why the magnitude of the trade e¤ects may di¤er across countries. The sizeable
heterogeneity in the trade e¤ects on volatility can contribute to understand the diversity of
results documented by the existing empirical literature.

quantitative approach. Next, it addresses the problem raised by Kehoe and Ruhl (2008)

Mapping Lwi =pi into constant-price GDP in PPP

It is instructive to start with variable Pi that in the Penn World Tables denotes the price level
of GDP, or more precisely the USD value of local expenditures over expenditures evaluated
in international prices. While the PWT variables are originally de…ned (and computed) in
terms of expenditures and relative prices, it is possible to cast them in terms of prices and
quantities as follows:

P
g pg;i qg;i
Pi = P
g pg qg;i
47

with pg;i and qq;i represent the USD price and quantity of good g respectively and pg is the
price of the same good in an international currency. Index g represents spending groups (basic
headings in PWT slang), which are constructed in a way that the sum of these expenditure
groups adds to total GDP. One of these groups are net exports, valuation of which follows
the assumption that
pnx;i qnx;i = pnx qnx;i = Si

where Si is in USD. In our model, consumers buy all individual goods q(x) and bundle them
using the CES aggregator in a …nal good qf . Hence, a PWT statistician would be able to
sample only from this one …nal good in each country and the quantity Pi measured becomes

Pi;t =

pi;t qf;i;t Li;t + Si;t
pt qf;i;t Li;t + Si;t

Setting PU S;t = 100 as is the case in the PWT implies pt = pU S;t =100 for all t. The
denominator of Pi;t is the current-price GDP in international prices

CGDPi;t = pU S;t qf;i;t Li;t + Si;t

and the real-price (Laspeyres) GDP in international prices is de…ned as

T
RGDPi;t = pU S;T qf;i;t Li;t + Si;t

where the last term captures real net exports in year t valued at prices from base year T .

48

Using the income-expenditure identity Li;t wi;t = pi;t qf;i;t Li;t + Si;t and simple algebra we get

RGDPi;t = pU S;T

(Li;t wi;t Si;t )

The last equality follows the PWT convention of valuing net exports by the price index
of domestic absorption for years other than the base year. By dropping the last term in the
approximation we assume that changes in real net exports are small for most countries comT
this assumption
pared to the role of domestic absorption. Given the weight attached to Si;t

Data Sources

We …rst describe the sample of countries and then the various sources of data.

D.1

Sample of Countries

Our sample consists of 24 core countries, for which we were able to collect all the information needed to carry out the quantitative analysis with no need— or very limited need— of
estimation. Other countries, for which data are nearly complete and estimation of some
sectors’output or value added was needed, are grouped as “Rest of the World”(ROW); the
49

sectoral trade data are available for virtually all countries. Some countries were aggregated
(for example Belgium and Luxembourg, and, before making to ROW, Former USSR, Former
Yugoslavia.). In particular, the minimum condition to keep a country (or an aggregation of
countries) in the sample is the availability of complete series for sectoral value added and
the presence of trade data.
The core sample of countries include the United States, Mexico, Canada, Australia,
China, Japan, South Korea, India, Colombia, the United Kingdom, a composite of France
and its overseas departments, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, a composite of Belgium and
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Greece, Austria and
Ireland. While some important countries appear only in our ROW group (most notably
Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia and oil exporters), the selection of core countries
is meaningful both in terms of geographic location (covering all continents) and in terms of
their share in global trade and GDP. The time period we study covers years from 1972 to 2007.
(1970–1971 are slightly problematic for trade data, as there are many missing observations;
hence the decision to start in 1972. The end period is chosen in order to avoid confounding
the trade e¤ects we are after with the …nancial crisis, which had other underlying causes.)We
focus on annual data.
The rest of the section describes our data sources and estimation methods.

D.2

Sectoral Gross Output

The data are disaggregated into 24 sectors: agriculture (including mining and quarrying),
22 manufacturing sectors, and services, all expressed in millions of US dollars for the core
countries and the Rest of the world (ROW). The 22 manufacturing sectors correspond to
50

the industries numbered 15 to 37 in the ISIC Rev. 3 classi…cation (36 and 37 are bundled
together).
The …nal dataset is obtained by combining di¤erent sources and some estimation. Data
on agriculture, aggregate manufacturing and services for core countries come mostly from
the EU KLEMS database. There is no available series for services output in China and India,
so they are obtained as residuals. Additional data come from the UN National Accounts.
Data on manufacturing subsectors come from UNIDO and EU KLEMS. For some subsectors, EU KLEMS data are available only at a higher level of aggregation (i.e. sector 15&16
instead of the two separately); in those cases, we use the country speci…c average shares from
UNIDO for the years in which they are available to impute values for each subsectors.
For the countries in the ROW, the output dataset is completed through estimation, using
sectoral value added, aggregate output, GDP and population (the latter two from the Penn
World Table 7.1) using Poisson regressions. For every country for which sectoral value added
and PWT data are available, we estimate gross output using Possion regressions. Finally,
for the few countries for which we have value added data but no PWT data, we estimate
sectoral output by calculating for each year and sector the average value added/output ratio,

Data collection notes on the core countries are as follows:

51

USA: missing years 1970-76 generated using a growth rate of each sector from EU
KLEMS (March 2008 edition).
Canada: 1970-04 EU KLEMS (March 2008 edition), for 2005-06 sectoral growth rates
from the Canadian Statistical O¢ ce’s National Economic Accounts (table Provincial
gross output at basic prices by industries).
China: data are from the Statistical yearbooks of China. Output in agriculture is
de…ned as gross output value of farming, forestry, animal husbandry and …shery and is
available for all years. Mining and manufacturing is reported as a single unit labelled
output in industry, which apart from the extraction of natural resources and manufacture of industrial products includes sectors not covered by other countries: water
and gas production, electricity generation and supply and repair of industrial products
(no adjustment was made). The primary concern was the methodological change initiated around 1998, when China stopped reporting total industrial output and limited
the coverage to industrial output of …rms with annual sales above 5m yuan (USD 625
000). The sectoral coverage remained the same in both series. There were 5 years of
overlapping data of both series over which the share of the 5m+ …rms on total output
decreased from 66 to 57 percent. The chosen approach to align both series was to
take the levels of output from the pre-1999 series (output of all …rms) and apply the
growth rate of output of 5m+ …rms in the post-1999 period. This procedure probably exaggerates the level of output in the last seven years and leads to an enormous
increase in the output/GDP in industry ratio (from 3.5 in 1999 to 6.0 in 2006). Our
conjecture is that the ratio would be less steep if the denominator was value added
52

in industry (unavailable on a comparable basis) because the GDP …gure includes net
taxes, which might take large negative values. Output in industry of all …rms re‡ects
the 1995 adjustment with the latest economic census.
There is no available estimate for output in services, so we use the predicted values
from a Poisson regression on the other core countries, with sectoral value added (see
below for details on the source), output in agriculture, output in manufacturing, GDP
and population (the latter two from the Penn World Table 7.1) and year dummies as
regressors.
India: data are from the Statistical O¢ ce of India, National Accounts Statistics. Years
1999-06 are reported on the SNA93 basis. Earlier years were obtained using the growth
rates of sectoral output as de…ned in their ‘Back Series’database. The main issue with
India was the large share of ‘unregistered’manufacturing that is reported in the SNA93
series but missing in the pre-1999 data. The ‘unregistered’manufacturing covers …rms
employing less than 10 workers and is also referred to as the informal or unorganized
sector. We reconstructed the total manufacturing output using the assumption that
the share of registered manufacturing output in total manufacturing output mirrors
the share of value added of the registered manufacturing sector in total value added in
manufacturing (available from the ‘Back Series’database).
As for China, output in services was estimated through a Poisson regression method.
Mexico: data are from the System of National Accounts published by the INEGI and
from the UN National Accounts Database. 2003-06 Sistema de cuentas nacionales,
INEGI (NAICS), 1980-03 growth rate from the UN National Accounts Data, 1978-79
53

growth rate from Sistema de cuentas nacionales, INEGI, 1970-1978 growth rate from
System of National Accounts (1981), Volumen I issued by the SPP.
Japan: data for 1973-06 are from EU KLEMS (November 2009 Edition), for 1970-72
the source is the OECD STAN database (growth rate).
Colombia and Norway: data are from the UN National Accounts Database.
Germany: the series is EU KLEMS’estimate for both parts of Germany.

D.3

Sectoral Value Added

The data on sectoral value added is obtained by combining data from the World Bank, UN
National Accounts, EU KLEMS and UNIDO. For the World Bank and UN cases, the format
of the data does not allow to have exactly the same sectoral classi…cation as the output data:
namely, mining here is not included in agriculture.
The World Bank and UN data are cleaned (we note a contradiction in the UN data for
Ethiopia and Former Ethiopia, which we correct to include in ROW …nal sample; see the …le
for more details).
Data on manufacturing subsectors come from UNIDO and EU KLEMS. UNIDO. For
some subsectors, EU KLEMS data are available only at a higher level of aggregation (i.e.
sector 15&16 instead of the two separately); in those cases, we use the country speci…c
average shares from UNIDO for the years in which they are available to impute values for
each subsectors; if no such data are available in UNIDO, we use the average shares for the
whole sample. We use the UNIDO data as baseline and complete it with EU KLEMS when
necessary (in these cases the growth rates of the EU KLEMS series are used to impute values;
54

this is done because sometimes the magnitudes are quite di¤erent in the two datasets). If
an observation is missing in both datasets, we impute it using the country speci…c average
sectoral shares for the years in which data are available.

D.4

Trade and dij’s

These bilateral import shares in gross output are obtained through several steps. We use the
SITC1 classi…cation for all the sample. This is made in order to ensure a consistent de…nition
of the sectors throughout the whole time period. In order to construct the agricultural
sector we aggregate the subsectors in the SITC1 classi…cation corresponding to the BEC11
group. For the manufacturing sectors, we use the correspondence tables available on the UN
website to identify the SITC1 groups corresponding to the ISIC 3 groups used for output
and value added. Re-exports and re-imports are not included in the exports and imports
…gures. We use bilateral imports and exports at the sectoral level from 1972 to 2007 from
the UN COMTRADE database. This dataset contains the value of all the transactions
with international partners reported by each country. Since every transaction is potentially
recorded twice (once reported by the exporter and once by the importer) we use the values
reported by the importer when possible and integrate with the corresponding values reported
by the exporter if only those are available.
As discussed in the paper, the djnmt ’s are computed as the ratio between the value of
exports from m to n in sector j and total spending by n on sector j at time t, where total
spending is measured as gross output plus imports minus exports of that sector. The share

55

djmmt is obtained as a residual from the accounting restriction:

djmmt

N
X

=1

djmnt

n6=m

We compute the surpluses as Total Exports - Total Imports, merge with the output
dataset and calculate the dij’s and dii using the formulas in the text.

D.5

Prices

The sectoral price indices come from the EU KLEMS database and data are available for
most of the core countries. We construct the sectoral de‡ators using a chain weighted
index. In particular, we compute for every year a weighted average of the growth rate of
the subsectoral price indexes, where the weights are the output shares in that year; then,
we apply this growth rate to the previous year’s sectoral price index (where the …rst year’s
price index is a weighted average of the subsectors). We then rescale so that the index is
100 in 1995 for all countries and sectors.
The aggregate price of GDP relative to that of the United States are obtained from
the PWT 5.6 for Former USSR, Former Czechoslovakia and Former Yugoslavia and PWT
7.1 for the other countries. For the ROW, we compute a weighted average of the relative
prices of GDP for all the countries for which the PWT data are available (most of the
ROW countries), where the weights are each country’s share of total output. Similarly, for
Belgium-Luxemobourg, we compute the weighed average of the two.

56

Exchange Rates

The exchange rates used for the conversion of output data come from the IMF.

To allow for more ‡exibility and accomodate world-wide structural changes over time we
do the calibration every year and then use a smoothed trend from the resulting time series.
Then renormalize so that the sum of alphas is 1 in all periods.

D.8

Prices

We use the sectoral price indexes from the EU KLEMS database to compute price de‡ators
for our three sectors (using a chain weighted index).
The relative price of GDP comes from the PWT 7.1 for all countries except Former Soviet
Union, Former Czechoslovakia and Former Yugoslavia, for which we use the PWT 5.6. For
the ROW, we compute a weighted average of the relative prices of GDP for all the countries
for which the PWT data are available, where the weights are each country’s share of total
output.

The Kehoe–Ruhl Critique

Kehoe and Ruhl (2008) argue that if real GDP is measured as a chain weighted quantity index
of value added, then terms-of-trade changes (and as a consequence, import price changes)
do not a¤ect real GDP up to a …rst order. The basic argument in Kehoe and Ruhl (2008) is
as follows:
Real GDP is output minus the cost of inputs, both evaluated at past-period prices

yt = f (l; mt )

pt 1 mt :

We have chosen output as the numeraire. Labour is the only "…nal" input, and is …xed
over time (or, at least, not responding to pt ), as in our case. Chain-weighed GDP growth is
simply
f (l; mt )
f (l; mt 1 )

pt 1 mt
pt 1 mt

:
1

Clearly, mt is chosen in response to pt , so that

fm (l; mt ) = pt :

Taking a …rst-order Taylor approximation of f (l; mt ) around mt 1 ,

f (l; mt )

f (l; mt 1 ) + fm (l; mt 1 )(mt

mt 1 ) = f (l; mt 1 ) + pt 1 (mt

63

mt 1 );

current GDP is
yt

f (l; mt 1 )

pt 1 mt 1 ;

which is last period’s quantities at last period’s prices, so there is no …rst-order change in
the chain-weighted quantity index!

Real GDP in the model

What does real GDP look like in the model? It would be tempting to replace current-period
prices in nominal GDP with base-period prices, but this is not what is reported in NIPA.
In NIPA, nominal quantities are de‡ated by price indices to obtain the real quantities. It is
therefore important to see how these price indices would be calculated in our model.
More speci…cally, real GDP is

f (l; mt )

1
PF t

Z

pF t (i)mF t (i)di

i2Mt

1
PHt

Z

pHt (i)mHt (i)di;

i62Mt

where PF t is the import price index, and PHt is the producer price index of the domestic
inputs.
Both price indices only measure a subset of goods, and, more importantly, a non-random
subset of goods. To be included in the price index, the good had to be transacted both in the
base period, as well as in the current period. Intuitively, this biases the price index towards
no change. If there is too big a price increase, …rms stop buying the product, and it will be
dropped from the index. In what follows, we try to quantify this bias. We show that in the
case the EK model, the bias is so severe that the price index is constant.

65

F.3

What does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measure?

The price index is a weighted average of price changes for goods that are in the sample in
both periods,

Suppose all products i are symmetric ex ante. Each draw a price at random from a
common distribution. Let
t

= Pr(pF t

pHt )

denote the probability that a good is imported at time t. By the law of large numbers, this
is also the measure of Mt .
Assume that the prices are independent across periods. This will be true if the productivity shocks in EK are independent. (For our argument to go through, we only need that
they are imperfectly correlated across periods.) Then the probability of being exported in
both periods is simply

F.4

0 t.

Why terms-of-trade changes a¤ect measured real GDP? An answer

A crucial assumption in Kehoe and Ruhl is that the BLS perfectly measures the prices that
are relevant for input demand. This is not the case, however. In particular, the BLS does
not (and cannot) measure the cost savings arising from input substitution, which are the key
driving force of the Eaton-Kortum model.
What does the BLS measure? The BLS compares current import prices to the past prices
of the same good from the same supplier. If a …rm switches from a Mexican to a Chinese
66

supplier, because it is cheaper, the BLS will miss the input price savings associated with it.
Moreover, the BLS certainly does not mix up import prices with domestic prices, they create
two separate price indices. So if the substitution is from an American supplier to a Chinese
supplier, the BLS will certainly miss it. This means that for models like EK in which the
extensive margin of suppliers plays a big role, the BLS would capture these terms of trade
changes as a¤ecting real GDP. The speci…c assumptions of the EK model actually ensure
that all cost saving will occur on the extensive margin, and the BLS will not record any of
the import price savings. That is, the Kehoe–Ruhl critique does not apply in this setting.
The intuition is as follows. Suppose Chinese goods have become 20 percent cheaper. Due
to the winner-take-all nature of Ricardian competition, they will be competitive for a wider
range of goods. These goods are o¤ the radar from the BLS— they have been switched from
an American or higher-cost foreign supplier. In fact, the goods that the BLS does measure
are not a random sample from all goods— these are the ones in which China is still relatively
expensive and/or other suppliers are still relatively cheap (otherwise, a switch would have
occurred). The BLS will measure Chinese prices with an upward bias, all other prices with
a downward bias. Hence its estimate of the terms of trade will biased toward no change.
In fact, in the EK model, the measured terms of trade remains constant. In any other
model, with only a partial role for the extensive margin, some of the price change would
show up in the terms of trade, some would go directly in measured productivity. This could
be the explanation for the observed correlation of terms of trade and productivity in the
data.
