Tri-Party Repo Pricing
Grace Xing Hu, Jun Pan, and Jiang Wang
NBER Working Paper No. 21502
August 2015
JEL No. G1,G12
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we examine the pricing determinants in the systemically important tri-party repo market.
Taking advantage of the recently available N-MFP reports filed by money market funds, we construct
a novel dataset that contains tri-party repo transactions between money market funds and dealer banks.
We find a large cross-sectional heterogeneity in repo pricing, reflected most significantly in the haircuts
of repos backed by equity and corporate bonds. Surprisingly, it is the fund families, not bank dealers,
who are the dominant factor in determining the pricing. Moreover, the repo market exhibits significant
segmentation, with fund families adopting three different pricing schemes: counter-party sensitive,
counter-party and collateral sensitive, and uniform. Most fund families use uniform haircuts by fixing
a constant haircut, which itself varies across families, for all repos within each asset class, regardless
of the quality of collateral or counter-party. Investigating further on the lending/borrowing relationship
between fund families and dealers, we find that, when faced with such a rich pricing pattern, dealers
do not shop around for a better haircut and are inclined to maintain a stable relationship with their
lenders. Finally, for repos backed by Treasury securities, there is little variation in both haircuts and
spreads, regardless of the fund family.

Introduction

Repurchase agreements (repos) are considered to be the largest and the most important
short-term financing channel for a variety of financial institutions.1 For these institutions,
the loss of access to the repo market could be devastating. Moreover, there exists a strong
spillover eﬀect due to the highly interconnected structure of the repo market. As we experienced in the recent financial crisis, disruptions in the repo market could impose a great risk
to the broad financial sector, adversely aﬀecting not only repo market participants but also
other investors holding similar assets. Despite of its systemic importance, the repo market
remains opaque to most market participants, including even the regulators. Because no official data on repos exists, questions as basic as the overall size of the market are diﬃcult to
answer, let alone finding information on the market structure, activity and pricing. Lack of
data is the main reason why empirical work lags behind theoretical discussions in this area.2
Using the recently available N-MFP reports filed by U.S. money market funds (MMFs),
we construct a novel data set that contains a large sample of monthly tri-party repo transactions with key information on counter-parties, amount, haircut, rate, tenor and collateral.
Tri-party repos, with details discussed in Copeland, Duﬃe, Martin, and McLaughlin (2012),
are an important segment of the repo market.3 The main advantage of our tri-party repo
data is that the information is at the transaction-level and contains details of the underlying
collateral, including descriptions of issuer names, types of securities, coupons and maturity
dates. Using these descriptions, we hand match the collateral to the relevant databases,
security by security. The entire collateral pool covers a wide range of asset classes, but we

Because repo deals are transacted over-the-counter, the exact size of the aggregate repo volume is
unknown. Several papers, including Gorton and Metrick (2010), Gorton and Metrick (2012) and FRBNY
(2010), estimate the total outstanding amount to be approximately $10 trillion in the U.S. before the 2008
financial crisis.

The theoretical discussions include Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), He and Xiong (2012), Martin,
Skeie, and Thadden (2014), Zhang (2014), Lee (2015), among others.

Tri-party repos are an important form of secured short-term lending for money market funds. Money
market funds are always cash lenders, and dealer banks are always cash borrowers in our sample. Collectively,
money market funds account for around one-third of the total lending in the tri-party repo market. Money
market funds are generally regarded as safe investments because they can only hold short-term, high-quality
and high-liquidity assets. The weakness of industry was revealed by the Reserve Primary Fund’s “breaking
the buck” event in September 2008 and the subsequent “run” on money market funds. In the wake of the
crisis, money market funds in the U.S. went through a major regulatory reform in 2010, which aims to
strengthen the regulatory requirement for the industry and better protect investors. Under the new rules,
all U.S. money market funds need to disclose the details of their portfolio holdings with the SEC, through
the monthly N-MFP filings.

focus on matching repos on equities, corporate bonds and Treasuries, which have standard
and publicly accessible databases.4
To our best knowledge, this level of granular collateral information has never been collected and studied before. There are only two existing data sets on tri-party repos that we
are aware of.5 The one most related to ours is discussed in Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Orlov
(2014), which is based on the top 20 money market fund families’ quarterly filings (N-CSR,
N-CSRS and N-Q) before the 2010 MMF reform. Since money market funds disclose only
the general asset classes in their quarterly filings, their repo data doesn’t have the collateral
information at the security level. The focus on only the top 20 fund families also raises the
question of how representative these repo transactions are. By contrast, our data covers the
repo transactions of all U.S. money market funds, totaling 751 individual funds from 160
fund families. Another set of tri-party repo data is collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, as discussed in Copeland, Martin, and Walker (2014). Their data contains aggregate quantity numbers across lender-dealer pairs for various collateral asset classes. Due to
the aggregation, transaction-level repo information is lost. Hence the authors focus on the
average haircuts faced by each dealer in each collateral asset class.
Taking advantage of our unique data, we investigate the determinants of tri-party repo
pricing, namely, haircuts and interest rates. We are particularly interested in how theoretically important factors, such as the collateral characteristics, counter-party risk, lending
relationship and credit market conditions, aﬀect repo prices. Our repo data is ideal for these
pricing tests because the collateral details make it possible for us to quantify the risk of the
collateral pool and thereby examine the repo price sensitivity with regards to the collateral. Moreover, we are able to control the collateral characteristics when investigating the
relations between repo prices and other potential factors such as counter-party risk. This is
important because results would be inconclusive and potentially misleading if the collateral
characteristics are left uncontrolled.
4

For the equity securities, we match them to the Compustat/CRSP database according to the issuer
names, and then use the historical returns to calculate volatilities and obtain other firm-level information
such as size and industry. For the corporate bonds, we match them to the Mergent FISD database by a
combination of issuer names, maturity dates and coupons. For the matched bonds, we obtain the bond-level
characteristics including ratings, issuance size, age and maturities. Similarly, for the Treasury securities, we
match them to the CRSP database according to the maturity dates and coupons.
5

In Gorton and Metrick (2010) and Gorton and Metrick (2012), the authors use a private repo data
provided by an anonymous dealer. However, the data covers only bilateral repos in the interbank market,
diﬀerent from the tri-party repos that we discuss in this paper.

2

We find that there is a large heterogeneity in repo pricing, reflected most significantly
in the haircuts of repos backed by equity and corporate bonds. For example, over our main
sample period from November 2010 through August 2013, which falls under the relative
calm of post crisis, the median haircut of equity repo remains stable at around 8.01%. By
contrast, the haircuts at the 10th and 90th percentiles are 5.00% and 8.92%, respectively.
This large variation in haircuts, which is driven mainly by cross-sectional dispersion, is
contrary to the conventional wisdom that repo pricing is determined almost exclusively by
asset class. Unlike repos for equity or corporate bond, however, Treasury repos exhibit highly
homogeneous pricing: haircuts at the 90th percentile is 2.05%, only slightly higher than the
10th percentile of 2.00%. This indicates that the pricing of repos backed by risky assets such
as equity and corporate bonds involves more complexity.
In order to understand the large variation in equity repo pricing, we consider important
characteristics including collateral quality, transaction size, counter-party risk, and lending
relationship. Surprisingly, we find that the large heterogeneity in the haircuts of equity
and corporate bond repos is driven mainly by diﬀerences across various money market fund
families.6 For example, haircuts demanded by Fidelity funds, the largest fund family in
terms of repo lending, range between 8% and 9%, while haircuts demanded by other fund
families vary from 2% to 8%. For corporate bond repos, there are also substantial diﬀerences
in the level of haircuts demanded by diﬀerent fund families. On the other side of the repo
transactions are dealers, who act as cash borrowers. They behave simply like price-takers:
when a dealer borrows from multiple fund families, it faces diﬀerent haircuts even though
the collateral of their repos are very similar. Overall, our evidence seems to suggest that it
is the fund families, not the dealers, that determine the haircuts.
In addition to the diﬀerence in the level of repo pricing, fund families are also diﬀerent in
their pricing schemes. We observe three pricing schemes adopted by diﬀerent fund families:
counter-party sensitive, counter-party and collateral sensitive, and uniform. Fidelity, the
6

Within each fund family, all funds behave very similarly. This could be due to the fact that repo
transactions are usually negotiated by an asset manager responsible for all money market funds within
the same family. We rely on the investment adviser information provided by the money market funds
to determine its aﬃliated family. The investment advisers belonged to diﬀerent subsidiaries of a holding
company are manually grouped together. The only exception is BlackRock Fund Advisors (Sec no. 80122609). This investment company was formerly known as Barclays Global Fund, and became a subsidiary
of Blackrock after Barclays sold its fund unit to Blackrock in 2009. Our data shows that this fund family
behaves very diﬀerently from other Blackrock money market funds, probably due to historical inheritance
of Barclays’ trading desks. As a result, we treat this fund family as a stand-alone Barclays fund family.

top lender in equity repos, assigns haircuts mainly according to the identities of the counterparties. It demands higher haircuts for repos with JP Morgan relative to other counterparties. The median haircut of JP Morgan’s repos is 8.81% and the inter-quartile range,
across all transactions over our sample period, is only 0.18%. By comparison, all the rest of
the eleven counter-parties of Fidelity enjoy a median haircut of 8.01% and the inter-quartile
range is 0.08%. This higher haircut demanded for JP Morgan cannot be explained by the
collateral quality of its repo transactions. In fact, the equity collateral posted by JP Morgan
and other dealers has similar risk. Neither can this pricing diﬀerential be explained by
the potential counter-party risk associated with JP Morgan, whose average five-year CDS
spreads are actually lower than several of Fidelity’s other couter-parties during our sample
period. The size of its repo transactions with Fidelity is also on a par with that of Credit
Suisse, another counter-party of Fidelity.
Money market funds in the Bank of America family use a pricing scheme that is sensitive
to both the dealer and the risk of the underlying collateral. In addition to charging diﬀerent
haircuts for diﬀerent dealers, Bank of America funds also consider the risk of the collateral
posted by these dealers.7 They demand higher haircuts for collateral that are concentrated in
a few stocks and collateral with higher volatility. That is, Bank of America demands higher
haircuts for repos backed by riskier equity securities. This pricing scheme is consistent with
the theory that a haircut serves as a safety check in the event that a counter-party defaults
and hence should be calibrated to the risk of the underlying securities.
All of the remaining five fund families in the equity repo market use a uniform pricing
scheme. These fund families fix their repo haircuts to a constant level, regardless of the
counter-parties or the collateral quality. This constant level, however, varies from family to
family. For example, State Street and Goldman Sachs funds ask for a 8% haircut, Morgan
Stanley and Charles Schwab funds ask for 5%, and Federated Investors money market funds
ask for 2%. Since these fund families often accept collateral with similar quality and lend to
the same dealers, the variation across fund families is not related to collateral and counterparty risk.
These rich pricing patterns show a clear segmentation by fund families in the equity repo
market. Moreover, none of the two theoretical important variables, collateral and counterparty risk, can explain this segmentation. Instead, we find that the market concentration
7

Though diﬀerent counter-parties face diﬀerent haircuts with Bank of America funds, this diﬀerence is
not related to the counter-parties’ default risks, which are measured using their CDS spreads.

4

is a potential reason why fund families follow diﬀerent pricing. The lending in the equity
repos is highly concentrated, with Fidelity funds alone accounting for approximately 70% of
the market. The second and third largest lenders, Morgan Stanley and Federated Investors,
account for another 17%. As the single dominant lender, Fidelity’s choice of asking for the
highest haircuts could be a rational decision to protect its large exposure in the equity repos.
Fidelity funds can also aﬀord the high haircuts because dealers with large demand of equity
repos have no choice but to trade with Fidelity, due to the limited financing capacity of the
other fund families. Smaller lenders such as Morgan Stanley and Federated Investors funds,
on the other hand, have to ask for lower haircuts in order to stay competitive in the market.
This naturally raises the question of the dealers’ incentives and behaviors in this market.
In particular, when faced with such variations in pricing and pricing schemes, should dealers
shop around to minimize their haircuts and maximize their use of leverage? Under this
hypothesis, it should first borrow from non-Fidelity funds that charge low haircuts and then
fulfill the rest from Fidelity funds. As a result, we should observe a more stable relationship
between the dealer and its non-Fidelity counter-parties. The empirical evidence is, however,
somewhat mixed. We do find that JP Morgan maintains a more stable relationship with
its non-Fidelity counter-parties (Morgan Stanley funds), while managing the variation of its
monthly borrowing mainly by adjusting its repo amount with Fidelity funds. But we do not
observe this kind of behavior in other dealers, who split their borrowing from Fidelity and
non-Fidelity funds by a stable proportion over time.8 It is possible that dealers are not sensitive to haircuts during the relative calm and liquid post-crisis sample period. Dealers might
also care more about maintaining a stable relationship with their lenders. Indeed, dealers do
tend to trade consistently with the same set of counter-parties across time, suggesting that
their relationship with the lenders is important for them. Overall, it is clear that pricing is
not the only factor that determines dealers’ behavior in the tri-party repo market.
The pricing in the corporate bond repo market is similar to the equity repo market. Fund
families dominate the repo pricing, and most fund families use the uniform haircut pricing
scheme. Among the uniform pricing schemes, there is also substantial variation in the levels
of haircuts chosen by diﬀerent fund families. For example, Blackrock funds assign a 7%
haircut for most of their corporate bond repos, approximately 5 percentage points higher
than the 2% haircut demanded by the Federated Investors funds. It is worth noting that
8

These examples include Credit Suisse and Barclays, which are the largest- and the third-largest dealers
in the equity repo market.

5

most of the fund families in our sample do accept both investment grade and non-investment
grade bonds as collateral. Nevertheless, fund families that use the uniform pricing scheme
assign the same haircuts across all repos, regardless of the underlying corporate bonds.
Besides the uniform pricing scheme, some fund families use a collateral sensitive pricing
scheme. But this pricing scheme is sensitive only to the broad rating category, investment
grade or high-yield, of the underlying corporate bonds. Within each rating category, however,
the haircuts are uniform and are not sensitive to any bond characteristics. Morgan Stanley
funds, for example, assign an approximately 5% haircut for repos with investment-grade corporate bond collateral and an approximately 6% haircut for repos with high-yield corporate
bond collateral. We don’t find any fund family that uses the counter-party sensitive pricing
scheme in the corporate bond repo market.9
Since a tri-party repo is essentially a collateralized loan, an additional important pricing
variable is the interest rate. Because interest rates on tri-party repos follow short-term
interest rates closely, our main interest rate variable is repo spread, calculated as the repo
interest rate in excess of the overnight Fed Fund Rate. Repo spreads are determined mainly
by the maturity, which is not surprising given the term structure eﬀect of interest rates.
For one standard deviation increase in maturity, or 29 business days in the case of equity
repos, the spread increases by 4.9 bps. For one standard deviation increase in maturity, or 15
business days in the case of corporate bond repos, spread increases by 3.8 bps. Repo spreads
are not sensitive to collateral and counter-party risk. We also don’t find any substitution
eﬀect between spreads and haircuts for tri-party repos.
In addition to the fund family and the dealer, another important player in the tri-party
repo market is the third-party clearing bank, either JP Morgan Chase or Bank of New
York Mellon. Due to the daily unwind arrangement, the large intra-day exposure of the
two clearing banks is an important risk factor for the overall financial system, and can
potentially aﬀect the pricing in the tri-party repo market. To address these concerns, we
look at the time-series variations in our sample, which luckily covers a period during which
the unwind procedure went through several major changes. During the early part of our
sample period, the unwind happened between 8:00 and 8:30 in the morning; since August
22, 2011, the unwind has moved to 3:30 in the afternoon; and at the end of 2012, JP Morgan
9

Unfortunately, Fidelity funds, which adopt the counter-party sensitive pricing scheme in the equity repo
market, do not show up in our corporate bond repo data because of a reporting error in the funds’ N-MFP
filings. Fidelity represents approximately 30% to 40% of the lending in the corporate bond repos

6

Chase stopped intra-day lending on non-maturing repo transactions. Despite these changes,
the distributions of haircut and spread remain stable across time during our sample period.
Moreover, we find no fund family adjusts its pricing scheme with respect to the changes in
the unwinding time. Overall, the concerns for the clearing banks’ intra-day exposure are not
reflected in the repo pricing during our sample period.
In relation to the existing literature, the two papers that are most related to ours are
Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Orlov (2014) and Copeland, Martin, and Walker (2014). We
complement Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Orlov (2014) by focusing on the cross-sectional
variations of haircuts, taking advantage of our unique deal-level data with collateral information. We also add to Copeland, Martin, and Walker (2014) by identifying that the main
determinant of repo pricing is the fund family. The demands made by diﬀerent fund families,
not by dealers, cause the wide variation in haircuts. Both papers document interesting facts
during the crisis period, but our results help shed light on how the repo market works under
normal market conditions in the post crisis period. Our work is also related to the literature
on money market funds. This strand of literature includes McCabe (2010), Kacperczyk and
Schnabl (2013), Chernenko and Sunderam (2012), Strahan and Tanyeri (2012), among others. Our focus is on money market funds’ tri-party repos, which are an important component
of their investment portfolios.
The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes how we collect the repo
data and match the individual securities. Section 3 investigates the determinants of haircuts
and spreads for repos backed by equities. Section 4 studies the corporate bond repos, and
Section 5 studies the Treasury repos. Section 6 concludes the paper. In the Appendices, we
discuss the tri-party repo market before November 2010.

2.1

Data
The Repo Market

A repurchase agreement is a spot sale of securities coupled with a forward agreement to
buy back the same securities in the future with interest. In its simplest form, a repurchase
agreement is very much like a short-term collateralized loan between two counter-parties, a
lender who originally buys the securities and a borrower who uses its securities for a secured
cash loan. There are two major types of repos used in the market: bilateral repos and
tri-party repos.
7

In a bilateral repo, the collateral and cash are exchanged directly between two counterparties at both the onset and the maturity of the repo transaction. Tri-party repos use a
third-party bank, which acts as both the custodian and the clearing agent for the two counterparties in a repo deal. The third-party bank, either JP Morgan Chase or Bank of New York
Mellon in the U.S., handles all the administrations of the repo transaction, including receiving
and delivering securities and cash, marking securities to market and etc. Counter-party risk
is alleviated in tri-party repos because both collateral and cash are deposited at the thirdparty’s account. The clearing service provided by the third-party bank helps minimize the
operational burden of the lenders, especially those who don’t have personnel or technologies
to handle complicated collateral posted by the borrowers. The third-party bank also acts
as the intra-day financier for the cash borrower during the time gap associated with the
unwinding of repos. Copeland, Duﬃe, Martin, and McLaughlin (2012) provides a detailed
discussion of the role of the clearing banks in tri-party repo transactions.
Besides diﬀerences in the settlement arrangement, these two forms of repos also have
very diﬀerent clienteles. Bilateral repos are commonly used by dealers to provide funding for
their hedge fund clients, or among dealers to redistribute cash and certain securities. In a
tri-party repo market, dealers are usually cash borrowers and lenders are cash-rich investors
such as money market funds, security lenders, and sovereign funds. Most importantly, unlike
bilateral repos whose transaction details are seldom disclosed to the public, recently available
filings of money market funds provide a unique opportunity for us to study the tri-party repo
market empirically.

2.2

Repo Data After November 2010

Our main data source of tri-party repurchase agreements comes from monthly portfolio
holdings of money market funds after November 2010. Following the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s money market fund reforms in 2010, money market funds in the U.S. are
required to file their detailed portfolio information, at individual security level, with the SEC
through N-MFP forms. The N-MFP forms reflect money market funds’ portfolio holdings
on the last business day of each month and must be filed before the fifth business day in the
following month. The SEC then makes the monthly N-MFP data publicly accessible after a
60-day delay.
We download all N-MFP forms available on the SEC’s EDGAR website for the period

8

from November 2010 to August 2013, and then parse these text files to extract information for each item on these forms.10 Our main interest is money market funds’ repurchase
agreement holdings.11 Compared with other reports filed by money market funds before the
2010 reforms, the new N-MFP forms require money market funds to report not only basic
information about their repurchase agreements such as the counter-party dealer, maturity,
amount, haircut and interest rate, but also all the security details underlying each repurchase
agreement. For each underlying security, money market funds need to report the security
type, name of the issuer, maturity date, coupon or yield, principal amount and collateral
value. However, to avoid extremely lengthy filings, the SEC does allow a fund to simply
select the range for the number of the securities from one of the four categories: 51-100, 101500, 501-1000 or more than 1000, instead of listing all the collateral security by security.12
Some money market funds adopt this practice, but we do observe many cases in our data
where money market funds routinely report the full list of collateral even when the number
of the underlying securities exceeds 50.

2.3

Collateral Matching

Although money market funds describe the underlying securities in the N-MFP forms, the
descriptions required by the SEC don’t include security identifiers such as CUSIP or ISIN
codes. Thus the biggest challenge in our data processing procedure is to identify these
securities through the text descriptions provided by money market funds. We focus on
matching securities in three asset classes (equities, corporate bonds and Treasuries) because
only these securities have standard and publicly accessible databases on their issuance and
historical prices. Our collateral matching procedure follows two major steps: First, we
10
Our data covers 751 money market funds in the U.S., sponsored by 160 unique fund families. Among
all the money market funds, there are 310 prime funds, 131 government/agency funds, 80 Treasury funds,
121 single state funds and 109 tax-exempt funds.
11

The SEC requires money market funds to categorize their investment into 16 groups in item 31 of the
N-MFP form: Treasury Debt Government Agency Debt, Variable Rate Demand Note Other Municipal Debt,
Financial Company Commercial Paper, Asset Backed Commercial Paper, Other Commercial Paper Certificate of Deposit, Structured Investment Vehicle Note Other Note, Treasury Repurchase Agreement, Government Agency Repurchase Agreement Other Repurchase Agreement, Insurance Company Funding Agreement
Investment Company, or Other Instrument. If the investment type falls into repurchase agreements, i.e.,
Treasury Repurchase Agreement, Government Agency Repurchase Agreement and Other Repurchase Agreement, the details of the underlying securities backing the repurchase agreements need to be reported in item
32.
12

select potential equity, corporate bond and Treasury collateral according to the security
type, maturity and coupon. Next, we manually compare the collateral names listed on
the N-MFP forms with the oﬃcial names in the corresponding database to get individual
collateral’s unique CUSIP number.
After we find collateral’s CUSIP codes, we consider a repurchase agreement as an equity
repo if more than 85% of its collateral can be matched as equities. Similarly, if more than
85% of collateral can be matched as corporate bonds, we classify this repurchase agreement
as a corporate bond repo.13 For a Treasury repurchase agreement, we require all of its collateral matched to Treasury securities to eliminate noises in pricing due to non-Treasury
securities in the collateral pool. This bottom-up approach allows us to determine a repurchase agreement’s collateral asset class by examining its collateral pool security by security, a
more accurate approach than those of previous studies that rely on self-reported repo types.
In total, we have 3,350 equity repos, 1,291 corporate bond repos and 15,436 Treasury
repos with matched collateral information from November 2010 to August 2013. Compared
with the statistics compiled by SIFMA, our matched sample accounts for 14% to 20% of
the tri-party repos in these three asset classes during our sample period.14 The smaller
sample size is due to several reasons. First, our sample covers only tri-party repos by U.S.
money market funds, which accounts for approximately one third of the entire tri-party repo
market. Other repo lenders, such as security lenders, are not in our sample of tri-party
repos. Second, not all securities have descriptions clear enough to establish a unique match.
In equities, we are able to match 98% in terms of collateral numbers and 68% in terms
of collateral value. Most of the unmatched cases are because money market funds only
disclose the numbers of collateral, not the specific issues. The matching is much noisier in
corporate bonds because more information is needed to pin down a unique bond. As a result,
some repos are not in our matched sample because we couldn’t match the securities in the
collateral pool. In addition, we consider only repos consisting primarily of securities from
the same asset class and discard those with mixed asset classes. Nevertheless, we do have a
13

Since mixed collateral categories are common in tri-party repurchase agreements, especially for nongovernment repos, we choose the 85% threshold to balance between the sample size and the potential biases
caused by collateral in diﬀerent asset classes. Our main results do remain robust if we choose higher thresholds
such as 90% or 100%.
14

According to the statistics released by SIFMA, the total tri-party repo market has 243,624 deals with
total repo value of $59 trillion for the 34 months from November 2010 to August 2013. Among which, the
total numbers of equity, corporate bond and Treasury repos are 17,054; 9,014; and 85,268, respectively.

10

reasonably large repo sample with collateral from various asset classes. More importantly,
the matched securities cover a great range of securities in each asset class. The granular
security-by-security collateral information enables us to examine the determinants of repo
prices at a much finer scale than general asset categories.
Matching Equity Collateral
We consider a security a potential equity collateral if item 32.d in the N-MFP form contains
the following keywords: COMMON, STOCK, ETF, STOCK OR ETF, EQUITY, SHARES,
DEPOSITORY RECEIPT and GLOBAL DEPOSITORY RECEIPT. In addition, the collateral needs to have null coupon (item 32.c) and maturity date (item 32.b). We then
manually match the collateral names (item 32.a) with the oﬃcial company names in the
CRSP/Compustat database. When there are multiple matches, we choose the parent company’s CUSIP and assign it to the collateral security.
For the 34 months from November 2010 to August 2013, we classify 80,354 collateral as
potential equity securities, with total collateral value around $505 billion. Among which, we
are able to match 78,466 collateral with a total worth of $341 billion. In other words, we
are able to match more than 98% of the collateral by their names, but the remaining 2%
carry a significant value of $164 billion. The reason is that there are 253 unmatched cases
where the issuer names fall into the categories of 51-100, 101-500, 501-1000 or more than
1000. These cases represent $156 billion, or 95% of the value of the unmatched securities.
The remaining 1,635 unmatched cases, worth $8 billion in value, are only a tiny fraction of
our pool of potential equity securities. Overall, our procedure does a good job in matching
collateral by their descriptions in the N-MFP forms.
Matching Corporate Bonds
For potential corporate bond collateral, we check whether item 32.d in the N-MFP form
contains the following keywords: BOND, CBND, CORP, CORPORATE, OTHER NOTE
and FIXED INCOME. To rule out non-corporate bonds, we also require that the issuer
names don’t contain keywords such as TREASURY, MORTGAGE, FNMA, STRIP, TIPS
and etc.15 We then manually match the collateral name (item 32.a) with the oﬃcial corporate
15

The full list of keywords include FNMS, FXMS, FGHF, FGPC, FMCC, FMHS, FMPC, FRPC, FNAR,
FXAR, FGAR, FMPA, FRAR, FMAR, FNMA, GNMA, GMAC, MORTGAGE, ASSOCIATION for agency
bonds; TINT, TPRN, PRIN, PMT, INT, STRIP, TRPX for Treasury STRIPS; TIPS, INF, IX, USTIIN,

11

bond issuer names in the Mergent FISD database. If we find a match in the issuer’s name, we
check the maturity date (item 32.b) and coupon (item 32.c) of all bonds issued by the issuer
to see whether we can find a unique match. If there are multiple matched bonds, we choose
the most recently issued bond. If there is no match, we relax the condition and match only
on the maturity date as money market funds sometimes report null or bond yields for the
bond coupon item (item 32.c) in the N-MFP forms. In addition, we exclude all convertible
bonds.
For the period from November 2010 to August 2013, we classify 257,347 collateral as
potential corporate bond securities, with total collateral value at approximately $824 billion.
Among which, we are able to match 166,809 collateral with total collateral value of $329
billion. For the remaining 90,538 unmatched collateral, most of the cases are due to poor
data quality, such as missing or null issuer names, maturity or coupons. For example, 30,408
of the unmatched corporate bond collateral are by Fidelity money market funds, all due to
the reason that the maturity date information is missing in the original N-MFP forms. As
a result, we don’t have Fidelity money market funds’ corporate bond repos in our matched
sample even though Fidelity is a large lender in the corporate bond repo market.16
Matching Treasury Bonds
For potential Treasury bond collateral, we check whether item 32.d in the N-MFP forms
contains the following keywords: UNITED STATES, TREASURY, TREAS, NOTE, BILL,
BOND, NTS, BDS and NOTY. In addition, we rule out collateral which have keywords
suggesting the bonds are likely to be agency bonds, Strips, Tips, or corporate bonds. The
collateral must also have valid coupon (item 32.c) and maturity date (item 32.b). We then
search the CRSP Treasury database to find Treasury securities with the exact same coupon
and maturity date. For collateral that can be matched, the matching is always unique as
there exists no two Treasury securities with the same coupons and maturity dates.
We consider 137,804 collateral as potential Treasury securities, totaling 4.5 trillion in
USTIIB, TRIN, TRIB for Treasury inflation protected bonds; TREASURY, UNITED STATES, TREAS,
NOTE, BILL, NTS, BDS and NOTY for Treasury bonds.
16

An example is the filing of a Fidelity fund (EDGAR series id: S000004822) on June 2013. The fund
has a $17 million corporate bond repo with BNP Paribas Securities Corp. However, the fund doesn’t
report the maturity date information for all the underlying bonds, even though it classifies all collateral as
CORPORATE and reports their coupons correctly.

12

dollar value.17 Out of which, we are able to match 128,782 collateral, 93% in terms of
numbers and 91% in terms of collateral value. Judging by the reported numbers for item
32.c in the N-MFP forms, most of the unmatched cases are because money market funds
report yields instead of coupons for the collateral. Since it is very common for multiple
Treasury securities to mature on the same date, we don’t relax the criteria to match solely
on the maturity date as it often gives multiple matches in the case of Treasury collateral.

2.4

Repo Data Before November 2010

Since the N-MFP filings are implemented only after the 2010 reform, we rely on the annual
(N-CSR), semi-annual (N-CSRS) and quarterly (N-Q) filings of money market funds to
obtain the tri-party repo data before November 2010. In these reports, money market funds
list the basic information for their repurchase agreement holdings such as the counter-party,
amount, collateral value, haircut, interest rate and maturity date. However, they are not
required to report the details of the underlying securities. Nevertheless, in many cases,
money market funds do describe the collateral asset classes for their repo positions.
Unlike the standard text format used by N-MFP filings, the N-CSR, N-CSRS and N-Q
filings don’t have a standard format and are sometimes not even in text files. Thus, most of
the data have to be manually collected. We download the N-CSR, N-CSRS and N-Q filings
for the top 50 prime funds, the top 25 agency funds and the top 25 Treasury funds during
the period from January 2005 to September 2010. The rank is determined by money market
funds’ average fund size from November 2010 to August 2013. Since money market funds
from the same fund family occasionally file their reports in one form, we end up checking 129
unique money market funds, among which 102 funds have repurchase agreement holdings
from January 2005 to September 2010.
In total, we collect 18,187 repo transactions with total repo value of approximately $7.9
trillion. Based on the collateral asset classes reported by the money market funds, we
classify these repurchase agreements into the following categories: Treasury, agency, equity,
corporate bond and others. In the sample we collected, there are 5,947 Treasury repos with
total value of $2.9 trillion, 4,285 agency repos with a total value of $2.0 trillion, 677 equity
17

During the period from November 2010 to August 2013, 28,880 repos are reported as Treasury Repurchase
Agreements by money market funds (item 31). These repos have in total 210,644 collateral. Of these
collateral, we consider 72,840 securities as Strips, Tips, agency bonds, corporate bonds or with missing
maturity. We exclude these securities in our matching process.

13

repos with a total value of $199 billion and 2,513 corporate bond repos with a total value
of $557 billion. The rest are repurchase agreements with either no collateral asset class
information, collateral with mixed asset classes, or collateral in other asset classes such as
structural finance products, commercial papers, municipal bonds and etc.

Data Summary

Growth of The Tri-Party Repo Market
The growth of the tri-party repo market is illustrated as the two time series plots in Figure 1.
The solid lines aggregate the repo transactions of all U.S. money market funds from November
2010 to August 2013; the dotted lines aggregate the repos by a sub-sample of 102 large funds
for which we manually collect the quarterly data from 2005 Q1 to 2010 Q3. Since money
market funds’ quarterly filings are usually reported at diﬀerent calendar months, the total
tri-party repo numbers and amount before November 2010 are added up for every calendar
quarter and reported at the quarterly frequency. As a comparison with the full sample, we
also plot the sub-sample funds’ monthly repo positions from November 2010 to August 2013.
The 102 large funds in our sub-sample account for a majority of the total repo lending by
money market funds, approximately 60% in numbers and 85% in amount. Both the full
sample and the sub-sample show similar time-series trends after November 2010, suggesting
that the 102 funds are a representative sample of the money market fund lenders in the
tri-party repo market.
Both the total number and the value of tri-party repos show a steady growth before 2008
Q1. Money market funds then reduce their lending following the collapse of Bear Stearns
and throughout the 2008 financial crisis. At the last quarter of 2008, the worst period of
the 2008 financial crisis, the total number of repo deals drops to 627, approximately 34
percentage points lower than one year ago in 2007. Though a big reduction in the number of
deals, the total loan value shrinks only by $57 billion to $400 billion, a mere 12 percentage
points decrease. One year later at 2009 Q4, the tri-party repo market bounces back to
1,033 deals of $424 billion, similar to the pre-crisis levels. This observation is consistent
with Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Orlov (2014), in which the authors also document a relative
moderate contraction of the tri-party repo market during the 2008 financial crisis.
After the financial crisis, the tri-party repo market continues to grow and peaks at the
end of 2012. The upward trend is then reversed in 2013, as the total deal value declines
14

approximately 30% from the peak to around 500 billion by the end of August 2013. According
to the statistics complied by SIFMA, the entire tri-party repo market, including other lenders,
such as security lenders and sovereign funds, has 7,792 repo deals with a value of $1,630 billion
in August 2013. Therefore, our sample of repos by the U.S. money market funds account
for approximately 30% of the total lending in the tri-party repo market.
Cross-Sectional Variations in Pricing
Table 1 summarizes the repo characteristics for the three classes of repos that we constructed
using the matched methods discussed before. We divide the period from January 2005 to
August 2013 into four intervals: pre-crisis period from 2005 Q1 to 2008 Q2, crisis period
from 2008 Q3 to 2009 Q2, post-crisis period from 2009 Q3 to 2010 Q3 and the most recent
period from November 2010 to August 2013. The cross-sectional distributions of haircuts
and spreads are also graphically presented as time-series plots in Figure 2. It is apparent
that the levels of haircuts and spreads in the tri-party repo market depend very much on
the underlying collateral’s asset classes. At all times, including both crisis and non-crisis
periods, the median haircuts and spreads for riskier securities, equities and corporate bonds,
are always above safe Treasuries.
More interestingly, there is a large cross-sectional variation in the haircuts and spreads
of repos backed by equities and corporate bonds. We focus on the sample period from
November 2010 to August 2013, during which our sample contains repos with matched
collateral information.18 Among the total 3,350 equity repos, the first decile of haircuts is
5.00% and the ninth decile of haircuts is 8.92%. The inter-decile range is a striking 3.92%, not
only large in magnitude but also important economically compared with the median haircut
of 8.01%. Moreover, as the cross-sectional distribution remains relatively stable across time
during this period, this variation comes mainly from the cross-sectional diﬀerences and is
not from the time-series changes. The pattern is very similar for corporate bond repos. The
inter-decile range of haircuts for the 1,291 corporate bond repos is a significant 4.00%. By
comparison, haircuts on Treasury repos are much more homogeneous, with an inter-decile
range of haircuts at merely 0.05%. For repo spreads, the cross-sectional dispersions in equity
and corporate bond repos are also larger than Treasury repos.
18

We discuss the tri-party repos before November 2010 in the appendix.

Equity Repos

In this section, we examine the pricing in the equity tri-party repo market. Equity securities,
as a whole, constitute $90 billion in dollar value or approximately 5% of the entire tri-party
repo market.19 As a comparison, the average daily trading volume is around $40 billion
for the New York Stock Exchange in 2013.20 Albeit only a fraction of the entire tri-party
repo market, equity tri-party repos serve as an important channel for dealers to finance their
securities holdings and meet their clients’ trading needs in the stock market.
Table 2 summarizes our sample of 3,350 equity repos with matched collateral during the
34-month period from November 2010 to August 2013. It is clear that the large heterogeneity
in the haircuts of equity repos is largely a result of the variations across fund families. Money
market funds in diﬀerent fund families charge very diﬀerent haircuts. Fidelity funds ask for
haircuts above 8%; Bank of America, State Street and Goldman Sachs funds ask for haircuts
around 8%; Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab funds ask for 5%; Federated Investors funds
ask for only 2%.
Within each fund family, haircuts are much more homogeneous. For the largest lender,
i.e., Fidelity money market funds, the standard deviation of haircuts is only 0.89% and
the inter-quartile range is 0.82%. Both numbers are significantly smaller than the standard
deviation and inter-quartile range of the full sample. For the second largest lender, Morgan
Stanley, the standard deviation of haircuts is a mere 0.46% and the inter-quartile range
is close to zero, at 0.01%. In fact, among the remaining five fund families, four of them
have inter-quartile ranges in haircuts less than 0.1%. The only fund family that has a wide
variation in its haircuts is Bank of America, with the standard deviation at 2.19% and the
inter-quartile range at 3.01%.
Compared with the relative similar haircuts charged by funds within each fund family,
haircuts faced by a dealer are much more dispersed, especially when the dealer borrows
from multiple fund families. For example, the inter-quartile range in haircuts is 2.96%
for Credit Suisse and 3.00% for Deutsche Bank. These large dispersions are the results of
diﬀerent haircuts charged by money market funds from diﬀerent fund families. Credit Suisse
borrows from money market funds belonging to five fund families: Fidelity, Morgan Stanley,
19

The numbers are based on the average tri-party repo market statistics from November 2010 to August
2013, provided by The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).

16

Federated Investors, Bank of America, and State Street. Deutsche Bank borrows from four
fund families: Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab and Bank of America.
By comparison, the dispersions in haircuts are much smaller for dealers that borrow
mainly from one fund family. This type of dealers include JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and
Mizuho. Take JP Morgan as an example, the inter-quartile range of haircuts is only 0.17%.
This is because 1,068 of its equity repo deals are with Fidelity and only 87 deals are with
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Therefore, the small variation in haircuts is due to
the fact that JP Morgan borrows most from Fidelity, and Fidelity assigns similar haircuts
for all of its equity repos with JP Morgan. Similarly, the variations of haircuts are small for
Goldman Sachs and Mizuho because these dealers mainly borrow from one fund family.
The above observation is confirmed in Figure 3, which compares equity repos’ haircuts
against the underlying collateral’s volatility, a common risk measure for equity securities.
We plot repos of the top four fund families that have more than 100 repo deals, i.e., Fidelity,
Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab and Bank of America. As a comparison, we also plot the
repos of the top two dealer banks: JP Morgan and Credit Suisse. Clearly, when a dealer
borrows from multiple money market funds families, its haircuts vary significantly even
though the repos are backed by collateral with similar volatility. For example, JP Morgan’s
repos with Fidelity funds always have haircuts more than three percentage points higher
than those with Morgan Stanley funds. The pattern is similar for the repos borrowed by
Credit Suisse.
In short, it is clear that fund families dominate the pricing in the equity repo market.
In our following analysis, we first examine the equity securities in the collateral pool. Then,
taking advantage of the security-level collateral information, we investigate diﬀerent pricing
schemes adopted by diﬀerent fund families. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the repo
pricing on quantities and MMF-dealer relationship in the equity repo market.

3.1

Collateral Characteristics

The 3,350 equity tri-party repos are backed by 66,347 equity securities. Among which, we
are able to identify 65,718 equity securities issued by 4,008 unique firms. Table 3 lists the top
20 securities used as equity repo collateral. Most of these stocks are large company stocks,
covering major industries such as manufacturing, technology, finance, and pharmaceutical
etc.

17

For each equity tri-party repo, we calculate the percentage of collateral that can be
matched as equities (matched), the number of collateral (#cols), the value-weighted number
of collateral (#cols (vw) ), the value-weighted firm size (size), the volatility of a valueweighted portfolio of the underlying collateral (port vol), the value-weighted average volatility of the underlying collateral (avg vol), and the percentage of financial firms (fin). We
have two volatility measures: the portfolio volatility and the average volatility. The first
measure treats the collateral pool of a repo as a value weighted portfolio, weighted by the
collateral value of individual securities. The portfolio volatility is the standard deviation of
daily portfolio returns in the one-year window before the repo date. The second measure is
the average volatility of the individual stocks, value weighted by the collateral value. Each
individual stock’s volatility is calculated using its daily returns in the same one-year window
preceding the repo date. Therefore, the diﬀerence of the two volatility measures depends
on the cross-correlations between the underlying securities in a repo’s collateral pool. We
are also interested in the percentage of financial firms because of potential wrong-way risk
- collateral risk is adversely correlated with the credit quality of the counter-party, which is
always a dealer bank in our sample of tri-party repos.
The characteristics of the equity securities accepted by diﬀerent fund families are summarized in Table 4. Most of the collateral of our sample of equity repos are indeed matched.
Even though we set the lower-bound to be 85%, the majority of the repos are fully matched.
The average percentage of matched securities is close to 100%, with a tiny standard deviation
of 1.47%. The equity collateral are usually large-capitalization firms. The average size is
from 9.44 to 10.97, or $13 billion to $58 billion on a dollar basis. On average, 17% to 23%
of the collateral are financial company stocks.
The most noticeable diﬀerence across diﬀerent fund families is in the collateral concentration. Equity repos by Fidelity and State Street funds have smaller number of collateral
per repo and hence higher collateral concentration. For Fidelity’s repos, the average number
of collateral per repo is 7.17. After taking into account the relative size of the individual
securities, the value-weighted number of collateral per repo drops to only 3.82. Similarly, the
average value-weighted number of collateral per repo is only 7.19 for State Street’s funds.
By comparison, the collateral pool for the rest five fund families’ repos are much more diversified. The number of collateral per repo ranges from 30.34 to 71.48 and the value-weighted
number of collateral per repo ranges from 13.02 to 39.83. As a result of the more concen-

18

trated collateral pool, the average portfolio volatilities for Fidelity and State Street funds
are among the highest, 29.61% and 28.08%, respectively. For the rest of the fund families,
the average portfolio volatility is from 18.70% to 22.05%.

3.2

Haircuts

We find three pricing schemes in haircuts: counter-party sensitive, counter-party and collateral sensitive, and uniform. We discuss these diﬀerent pricing schemes through the examples
of representative fund families. In our sample, Fidelity funds use the counter-party sensitive
pricing scheme; Bank of America funds use the counter-party and collateral sensitive pricing
scheme. The remaining fund families use the uniform haircut scheme. However, among
the uniform haircuts, there is substantial variation in the haircuts chosen by diﬀerent fund
families.
Fidelity
Fidelity is the largest lender in the equity tri-party repo market. In our sample of equity
repos with matched collateral, it has 2,168 repo deals with 12 counter-parties. Fidelity’s
largest two counter-parties are JP Morgan and Credit Suisse. For its 1,068 repo deals with
JP Morgan, the average repo haircut is 8.83% and the standard deviation is a mere 0.15%.
In fact, most of the repos between Fidelity and JP Morgan have haircuts between the 8.70%
(the 1st decile) and 9.00% (the 9th decile). Similarly, among the 465 repo deals between
Fidelity and Credit Suisse, 431 repo haircuts are within a narrow band around 8.00%, ranging
from 8.00% to 8.34%; the remaining 34 repo haircuts are around 5.00%, ranging from 5.00%
to 5.26%.
It appears that Fidelity funds use a dealer-sensitive scheme on haircuts. Between its
two dealers, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse, Fidelity demands higher haircuts for JP Morgan
than Credit Suisse. This diﬀerential treatment in haircuts is unlikely to be explained by
the collateral quality or the counter-party default risk. The equity collateral provided by
JP Morgan and Credit Suisse have similar risk: the average collateral portfolio volatility is
31.4% for JP Morgan and 30.6% for Credit Suisse. In terms of the counter-party default
risk, JP Morgan’s average five-year CDS spreads is 99 bps, 27 basis points lower than the
average five-year CDS spreads of Credit Suisse. The size of JP Morgan’s repo transactions

19

with Fidelity is also comparable with that of Credit Suisse.21
We formally test Fidelity’s haircut policy on equity tri-party repos in a set of regressions.
The results are summarized in Table 5.22 The regression results confirm our conjecture
that money market funds in the Fidelity fund family set haircuts mainly according to the
identities of the counter-parties. Variables such as repo size, repo maturity and dummy
variables for time explain 10.6% of the total variation in haircuts. By comparison, adding
dummy variables for the dealers significantly increases the R-square by 24.5 percentage points
to 35.1%. None of the collateral variables nor the dealers’ CDS spreads is significant in the
regressions, whether used alone or in combinations. Not surprisingly, collateral variables and
dealers’ CDS spreads also don’t help improve the R-square of the regressions on haircuts.
Bank of America
Though Bank of America has only 146 equity tri-party repos in our matched sample, it is
the only fund family that shows a wide dispersion in the haircuts. The inter-quartile range
is 3.01%, the largest among all fund families. We pool together all of Bank of America’s
equity tri-party repos and run a battery of regressions in Table 6. Similar to Fidelity, the
dealer fixed eﬀect is strong in the regression on the haircuts of Bank of America’s equity
repos. Adding dealer dummies significantly improves the R-square of the regressions by 35.5
percentage points. Repo size, repo maturity, fixed dummies for time and dealers together
explain 79.2% of the total variations in Bank of America’s equity repo haircuts. Four out
of the five dealer dummies are statistically significant at the 5% level. In short, Bank of
America’s haircuts are sensitive to the counter-parties.
More interestingly, Bank of America’s haircuts are also sensitive to the underlying collateral. It assigns higher haircuts for repos backed by riskier collateral, which is most reflected
in collateral concentration ($col (vw)) and collateral volatility (port vol). Bank of America
asks higher haircuts for repos backed by more concentrated securities. A one standard deviation decrease in the value-weighted number of collateral per repo increases repo haircuts by
0.40 percentage point. Bank of America also requires higher haircuts for equity repos backed
by more volatile securities. A one standard deviation, or 6.85 percentage points, increases in
21

The total monthly equity repo transactions is on average 2.7 billion between Fidelity and JP Morgan,
and 3.1 billion between Fidelity and Credit Suisse. The numbers are based on the full sample of equity repos
which include those with unmatched collateral.
22

Since we don’t have CDS data for Mizuho Financial Group, the 197 equity repos between Mizuho and
Fidelity are not included in the tests.

20

the collateral portfolio volatility raises the repo haircuts by 1.49 percentage points. Among
all the collateral variables, the collateral portfolio volatility is the one with the largest economic impact and the one with the most significant t-value. The strong explanatory power
of the collateral portfolio volatility is also reflected in the eight percentage points increase in
the R-square of the regressions on repo haircuts.
Other Fund Families
Aside from Fidelity and Bank of America, money market funds in the rest of the fund
families use the uniform pricing scheme. The uniform haircuts required by these funds are
approximately 5% for Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab funds, 2% for Federated Investors
funds and 8% for State Street and Goldman Sachs funds.
Within each fund family, repo haircuts exhibit tiny dispersions. The inter-quartile range
in haircuts for the five fund families range between 0.01% and 0.06%. In other words, these
fund families fix their haircuts to a constant level, regardless of the counter-parties and the
collateral. More importantly, this uniform haircut scheme is not because these fund families
accept only a certain type of collateral or because they lend to only one dealer. In fact, these
funds do accept a wide range of equity securities as collateral and lend to multiple dealers.
It is not obvious why diﬀerent fund families chose diﬀerent levels of haircuts, especially
given that they often lend to the same group of dealers and accept similar collateral. For
example, State Street, Morgan Stanley and Federated Investors funds all lend to Credit
Suisse, yet these funds choose to ask for very diﬀerent haircuts. Therefore, we think the
levels of haircuts, to a certain extent, reflect diﬀerent fund families’ risk tolerance. Federated
Investors is the most aggressive one, by charging haircuts at approximately two times the
average daily price volatility (1.28%) of the underlying equity securities. Other fund families
are more conservative and set a larger buﬀer in haircuts relative to the volatility of the
underlying collateral.
The dominant role played by the fund families is also evident in the regressions of Table 7,
where we pool together all but Fidelity and Bank of America funds’ equity repos. Variables
such as repo size, repo maturity and the time dummies explain only 22.0% of the total
variation in haircuts. Adding four fund family dummies drastically improves the R-square
by 72.6 percentage points to 94.6%. By contrast, including additional dealer dummies helps
improve the R-square only by a marginal one percentage point. Moreover, none of the
collateral variables is statistically significant, confirming that these fund families’ pricing
21

schemes are uniform and don’t depend on the underlying collateral.
Besides the fund family and the dealer, another important agent in the tri-party repo
market is the third-party clearing bank. Unfortunately, our repo data does not contain the
identifies of the third-party banks. However, the rich pricing patterns exhibited by diﬀerent
fund families suggest that the pricing is unlikely to be explained by the associated thirdparty bank, which is either JP Morgan Chase or Bank of New York Mellon. Our sample
also covers a period during which the unwind procedure of the two clearing banks went
through several major changes that greatly reduced the intra-day exposure of the two banks.
However, we don’t observe any fund family adjusts its pricing scheme with respect to these
changes. Overall, the evidence suggests that the clearing bank does not play an important
role in the pricing of repos, at least not in our sample period.

3.3

Spreads

Next, we investigate the interest rates of the tri-party equity repos. Given the strong role
played by fund families in setting haircuts, we examine the determinants of repo rates not
only for the full sample but also separately for Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab
and Bank of America funds.23 Our main variable of interest is the repo spread, measured as
the repo interest rate minus the over-night Fed Fund Rate. The results are summarized in
Table 8.
The most important explanatory variable for spread is the repo maturity. This is not
surprising given the term structure eﬀect of interest rates. For one standard deviation increase in repo maturity, or 29 business days, repo spread increases by 4.90 bps. The maturity
eﬀect on repo spread is quite robust. The regression coeﬃcients on the repo maturity are
positively significant for three out of the four fund families that we tested, with the exception
of Charles Schwab funds.
In addition to the maturity eﬀect, size is also related to spread for equity repos. Large
repos tend to have lower spreads - an increase of one standard deviation in the log of repo
size decreases repo spread by -1.44 bps. However, this negative relationship is largely driven
by the repos of Fidelity funds, and is not significant for the other three fund families that
we tested.
23

We don’t run regressions separately for Federated Investors, State Street and Goldman Sachs because
these fund families have equal or less than 100 repos.

22

None of the three collateral variables, collateral concentration, volatility and the percentage of financial firms, can help explain the variation in repo spreads. We also find no robust
relationship between borrowers’ credit risk and repo spread. In the full-sample regression,
dealers’ CDS spreads are positively related to repo spreads. A 100 bps increase in a dealer’s
CDS spreads will raise its repo spread by 6.70 bps. But this positive eﬀect is only significant
for Charles Schwab funds, and not significant for the other fund families.
Lastly, we investigate the relationship between the two pricing variables: haircut and
spread. In theory, the relationship could be negative if there is a substitution eﬀect between
haircut and spread. The relationship can also be positive if lenders demand higher haircut
and, at the same time, higher interest rate for accepting riskier collateral. In practice, it is
clear that the relationship is positive across collateral asset classes. For example, haircuts on
equity repos are higher than Treasury repos because equities are in general riskier than Treasuries; spreads on equity repos are also higher because lenders demand higher compensation
for holding riskier equity securities. However, it is unclear what the relationship should be
for repos backed by the same collateral asset class.
For three out of four fund families that we tested, haircuts are not significantly related
to spreads. This is not surprising as most fund families use the uniform haircut scheme,
which will result no variation in the haircuts of repos within each fund family. However, for
Fidelity funds’ repos, there is a strong negative relation between haircuts and spreads. This
substitution eﬀect is strong - an increase of one percentage points in haircut is couple with
a 5.67 bps reduction in spread.

3.4

MMF-Dealer Relationship

The rich pricing patterns suggest that there is a clear segmentation in the equity repo market.
More importantly, neither collateral nor counter-party default risk can explain the diﬀerent
pricing and pricing schemes chosen by the fund families. To further understand this market
segmentation and its implication for the behavior of the lenders and borrowers, we look
at the trading relationship between money market funds and dealers in the tri-party repo
market.
For this part of the analysis, we don’t rely on the previous repo sample with matched
collateral securities. Instead, we use the full sample of repos that we can identify the asset
class of the collateral. Compared with the matched repos, this sample is larger and avoids

23

potential bias in our matching procedure caused by inaccurate reporting by MMFs. Though
without the information of the individual collateral, it better captures the complete MMFdealer trading relationship in the repo market.
We identify a collateral’s asset class by checking the keywords in the collateral type and
collateral subtype (item 32.d). A repo is considered as an equity repo if more than 85% of
its collateral are classified as equities; a repo is consider as a corporate bond repo if more
than 85% of its collateral are classified as corporate bonds. We consider all repos reported
as “Treasury Repurchase Agreement” (item 31) by money market funds as Treasury repos.
In total, we have 3,840 equity repos, 5,748 corporate bond repos and 28,880 treasury repos.
Table 9 summarizes the top fund families and their major borrowers in these three repo asset
classes; Table 10 summarizes the top dealers and their major lenders. Figure 4 graphically
present the pairs of fund families and dealers that have trading relationship in tri-party
repos.
Market Concentration
It is clear that the repo lending in the equity repo market is dominated by a few large fund
families. Fidelity fund family alone represents approximately 70% of the lending. Morgan
Stanley and Federated Investors, the second and the third largest lenders, account for another
17%. The top five fund families, in total, cover approximately 95% of the lending backed by
equity securities.24
The picture is similar on the borrowers’ side. Though there are in total 16 dealers, the
top five, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Barclays, Merill Lynch and Bank of America, account
for approximately 80% of the borrowing. Credit Suisse and JP Morgan are the largest two
borrowers, with average monthly repo amount ranging from 3.2 billion to 4.6 billion.
We observe a many-to-many relationship between fund families and dealers. A fund
family usually lends to multiple dealers and a dealer usually borrows from multiple fund
families. The two largest lenders, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, lend to almost every dealer.
The smaller fund families have few counter-parties. On the borrowers’ side, large dealers
usually borrow from both large and small fund families, while small dealers mainly borrow
from the two largest fund families, i.e., Fidelity and Morgan Stanley.
24
Compared with the matched equity repo sample, there are two new fund families, UBS and American
Beacon Advisors. But these two fund families account for only a tiny fraction of the total lending in the
equity repo market.

24

Though fund families and dealers have multiple counter-parties, most of their trading is
concentrated with a few partners. The number of counter-parties is significantly reduced
after taking the relative repo amount into account . For the largest lender, Fidelity, the
value-weighted number of counter-parties at each month is only 3.4.25 Among which, Credit
Suisse and JP Morgan account for approximately 60% of Fidelity’s total lending. For the
rest of the fund families, the value-weighted number of dealers is typically between one and
three. For dealers, the value-weighted number of fund families is also quite low, usually
between one and two. This suggests that relationship could be very important for both fund
families and dealers, as most of their trading is with a few fixed counter-parties. In addition,
for a pair of fund family and dealer that are major trading partners, they tend to trade
consistently every month in our sample period.
Repo Pricing and Quantity
The highly concentrated market structure could be a reason why we observe a clear market
segmentation in the pricing of equity repos. Among all the major fund families, Fidelity
funds ask for the highest haircuts, mostly between 8% and 9%. Given that Fidelity is the
dominant lender in the equity repos, this could be a rational decision to protect its large
exposure. In addition, since Fidelity is the only lender with a large financing capacity, it can
aﬀord the high haircuts as dealers with large demand of equity repos have no other choice in
the equity repo market. Smaller non-Fidelity lenders such as Morgan Stanley and Federated
Investors funds, due to their limited financing capacity, have to ask for lower haircuts in
order to stay competitive in the market.
The natural question to ask next is: what are dealers’ incentives and behaviors in this
market? Because the pricing is set by fund families, dealers are basically price takers.
However, a dealer can still decide its quantities with diﬀerent counter-parties. A potential
hypothesis is that the dealer’s priority is to minimize its haircuts and maximize its use of
leverage. Under this hypothesis, a dealer should shop around diﬀerent fund families for
the most lenient haircuts. Given the very concentrated market structure, the dealer should
first borrow from non-Fidelity funds that charge low haircuts and then fulfill the rest with
Fidelity funds. Therefore, we should observe a more stable relationship between the dealer
25
The number of value-weighted counter-parties are calculated as the inverse of the Herfindahl index based
on the repo amount between a fund family and a dealer. It is equivalent to the number of counter-parties
with the same repo size.

25

and the non-Fidelity funds.
The empirical evidence is, however, mixed. We find some positive evidence supporting
the hypothesis. The bottom panel of Figure 5 shows that JP Morgan has a more stable
relationship with Morgan Stanley funds from November 2011 to February 2013, compared
with its relationship with Fidelity funds. During this period, JP Morgan’s borrowing with
Morgan Stanley shows very little variations, while its borrowing with Fidelity fluctuates
significantly. In other words, JP Morgan manages its monthly borrowing mainly through
adjusting its repo quantities with Fidelity funds. The caveat is that we only observe this
pattern for JP Morgan during a short period of time.
On the other hand, there are many dealers whose borrowing with Fidelity and nonFidelity funds show similar variations through time. Credit Suisse, for example, reduces its
borrowing significantly during our sample period. Under the hypothesis, it should first cut
its borrowing with Fidelity because of the higher haircuts. However, we find that Credit
Suisse splits its borrowing from Fidelity and non-Fidelity funds by a stable portion over
time. Not only it cuts its borrowing with Fidelity funds, it also reduces its borrowing with
Morgan Stanley and Federated Investors funds, which are two other major counter-parties
that charge low haircuts. As a result, Credit Suisse’s equity repo quantities between Fidelity
and non-Fidelity counter-parties have similar time-series variations. Barclays, the thirdlargest dealer in the equity repo market, also behaves similarly like Credit Suisse.
In short, we don’t find strong evidence that suggests dealers are fully optimizing their
use of leverage by shopping around diﬀerent fund families. Of course, given that our sample
covers a period with ample liquidity and historical-low interest rates, the dealers may not
be very sensitive to the cost of repo financing. Nevertheless, the results suggest that prices
are not the only determining factor in the tri-party repo market. Dealers seem to also value
the trading relationship with their major counter-parties.

Corporate Bond Repos

Corporate bonds are also a popular form of non-government securities in the tri-party repo
market. According to the statistics provided by SIFMA, the amount of corporate bonds
posted as collateral in the tri-party repo market has similar magnitude as the equities, at
approximately $85 billion per month from November 2010 to August 2013.
In our sample, we have 5,748 corporate bond repos and 1,291 corporate bond repos with
26

matched collateral. The main reason we have fewer matched corporate bond repos is because
the corporate bond securities require three types of information (issuer name, coupon and
maturity date) to find a unique match, thereby making the matching process more diﬃcult
due to the limited disclosure quality in money market funds’ N-MFP filings. For example,
Fidelity, an important lender in the corporate bond repo market, is not in our sample because
the maturity date information is missing in most of its filings. Luckily, our sample still
contains a wide variety of fund families and dealers, which allows us to investigate diﬀerent
pricing schemes in the corporate bond repo market. Moreover, the matched corporate bonds
cover a broad range of securities from diﬀerent rating classes and issuer firms. This enables
us to investigate the repo price sensitivity to the underlying collateral.

4.1

Summary Statistics

The lending in the corporate bond repo market is also highly concentrated, but less so
compared with the equity repo market. The top lender, Fidelity, has on average 5.4 billion
outstanding repos at the end of every month, accounting for approximately 40% of the
market. The second and the third largest lenders are Bank of America and Morgan Stanley
funds. The top five fund families account for approximately 80% of the total lending. On
the dealers’ side, JP Morgan is the largest borrower, followed by BNP Paribas and Barclays
Group. The lending relationship between the money market funds and dealer is plotted in
the panel (b) of Figure 4. For the 1,291 matched sample of repos, we report the distributions
of haircut, spread, maturity and size in Table 11.
Table 12 summarizes the corporate bond collateral for the matched repo sample. Most
of the corporate bond repos are backed by a mixture of investment-grade and high-yield
bonds. On average, a repo’s collateral pool has 92% rated bonds and 70% investment-grade
bonds. The average corporate bond rating is 8.95, between Baa1(numerical rating 8) and
Baa2 (numerical rating 9). Most of the corporate bonds are old long-term bonds with large
issuance size. The average age is 3.32 years; the average remaining maturity is 7.84 years;
the average log issuance size is 20.38, or $709 million in dollar terms.

4.2

The Role of Fund Families

Similar to equity repos, fund families play the dominant role in assigning haircuts for the
corporate bond repos. This can be shown in Figure 6, where we plot the corporate bond

27

repo haircuts against the underlying collateral’s average credit ratings for the top four fund
families, i.e., Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Blackrock and Federated Investors. Out
of these top four, three fund families use the uniform pricing scheme. Federated Investors
funds’ repo haircuts are in a narrow range around 2%, even though the fund family lends
against both investment grade and non-investment grade bonds. Similarly, Blackrock funds
give a 7% haircut for most of its corporate bond repos, though the fund family trades
with eight diﬀerent dealers and accepts corporate bonds with ratings that range from Aa1
to B3. Another example is Bank of America funds, which give a constant 5% haircut.
However, diﬀerent from the previous two fund families, Bank of America’s collateral are
mostly investment-grade corporate bonds.
In contrast to the uniform pricing scheme, Morgan Stanley funds use a collateral-sensitive
pricing scheme, but only sensitive to the collateral’s rating category - investment grade or
non-investment grade. Morgan Stanley funds’ haircuts fall into roughly two categories: 5%
for repos with average collateral ratings at Baa3 or above, and 6% for repos with average
collateral ratings below Baa3. Within each rating category, the haircuts are not sensitive to
the individual repos’ collateral ratings. This is consistent with the common belief that investment grade and non-investment grade corporate bonds are considered two diﬀerent asset
categories in the tri-party repo market. But, it is worth emphasizing that many fund families in the corporate bond repo market don’t diﬀerentiate bond ratings and assign uniform
haircuts for both investment grade and non-investment grade bonds.

4.3

Regression Analysis on Haircuts and Spreads

In this part of the analysis, we use regressions to examine the determinants of corporate
bond repo haircuts and spreads. Given that some fund families price investment grade and
non-investment grade corporate bond repos diﬀerently, we also run regressions separately
for these two rating categories. The majority of the repos in our sample have collateral that
are a mixed pool of investment grade and non-investment grade bonds. We, therefore, try
two methods to classify corporate bond repos. The first method is by the average ratings
of the collateral and the second method is by the percentages of investment grade bonds
in the collateral pool. Table 13 summarizes the regressions results on haircuts; Table 14
summarizes the regressions results on spreads.
It is clear that fund families play the dominant role in setting corporate bond repo

28

haircuts, similar to the equity repo market. This is reflected in the drastic improvement of
R-square of the regressions on haircuts. Controlling collateral, month dummies and dealer
dummies, the R-square of the full-sample regression on haircuts is only 38.7%. Adding fund
family dummies improves the R-square by 45.4 percentage points to 84.1%.26
For all the collateral variables, only collateral rating is significant in the full-sample regression. An improvement of one standard deviation in rating will reduce the repo haircut by
0.38 percentage point. However, this strong relationship is simply driven by the diﬀerence in
haircuts across the two major rating categories. Within the investment grade only repos and
non-investment grade only repos, collateral rating can no longer explain the cross-sectional
variations in haircuts. In fact, none of the collateral controls is a significant determinant of
the haircuts of corporate bond repos.
The results are similar for repo spread. Non-investment grade repos have higher spreads
than investment grade repos. But, within the investment grade only repos and non-investment
grade only repos, spreads are not related to any of the collateral characteristics, including
the collateral rating. Repo spread does not depend on the dealer’s credit risk either. The
most robust explanatory variable for spread is the maturity of the repo. For one standard
deviation increase in repo maturity, or 15 business days, repo spread increases approximately
3.8 bps.

5

Treasury Repos

Our main focus in this paper is the pricing of repos backed by risky corporate collateral,
i.e., equities and corporate bonds. However, it is worth emphasizing that the majority of
the repos between money market funds and dealer banks are backed by safer government
collateral, mainly Treasuries and Agency securities. To draw a parallel with the pricing of
risky repos, we also investigate the pricing in the Treasury market.27 In total we have 28,880
Treasury repos. Out of which, we are able to match the underlying Treasury securities for
15,436 repos.
Unlike the very concentrated equity and corporate bond repo markets, the treasury repo
26

Adding fund family dummies also significantly improves the R-square of the regressions based on investment grade only repos and non-investment grade only repos.
27

We didn’t investigate the pricing in the Agency repos because there is no standard database on the
prices of the Agency securities.

29

market is more diversified and involves a large number of fund families and dealers. On the
lenders’ side, there are 88 unique fund families. Fidelity remains to be the largest lender in
the Treasury repo market, but it accounts for only 11.6% of the total lending. This is much
less than Fidelity’s market share in the equity and corporate bond repo markets. The second
and third largest lenders are Federated Investors and Dreyfus. The total market share of the
top five fund families is approximately 45%.
On the borrowers’ side, there are in total 35 dealers. Barclays is the largest borrower,
followed by Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas. All
five are non-US European banks. Together, the top five dealers borrow 47% and the rest 30
dealers split the remaining 53%. The lenders and borrowers are also more inter-connected
in the Treasury tri-party market. The panel (c) of Figure 4 shows a complicated and highly
intertwined network, in which every fund family lends to multiple dealer banks and every
dealer bank borrows from multiple fund families.28 Compared with the equity and corporate
bond repo markets, both fund families and dealers have more counter-parties in the Treasury
repos.
On the collateral’s side, most of the Treasury collateral are Treasury Notes. Table 15
summarizes the underlying Treasury securities in the collateral pool. On average, 79% of
securities are Treasury Notes, 15% are Treasury Bonds and the remaining 6% are Treasury
Bills. The average age is 2.39 years. A small fraction of the collateral, around 10.83%, are
on-the-run securities. The number of collateral per repo is also fewer, compared with the
equity and corporate repos. On average, there are approximately 3.43 securities, or 2.23
equal-size securities, per Treasury repo.
Panel C of Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 15,436 Treasury repos that we
can match the underlying collateral; Table 16 reports the summary statistics for the top ten
fund families and the top ten dealers. For the haircuts, the 1st decile of haircuts is 2.00%
and the 9th decile is only slightly higher at 2.05%. Thus, the majority of the Treasury repos
are simply charged with a constant haircut at approximately 2%. Compared with equity and
corporate bond repos, the spreads of Treasury repos have lower levels and smaller variations.
The 1st decile of Treasury repo spreads is -5 bps; the 9th decile is 8 bps. The spreads
are lower because investors demand lower premiums for holding safer Treasury securities as
collateral. It is also related to the shorter maturity. The majority of the Treasury repos

borrowers (dealer banks) are plotted.

are over-night, while equity and corporate bond repos tend to have maturities around one
month.
The small variations in haircuts and spreads indicate that the pricing in the Treasury
tri-party repo market is quite flat. We formally test this hypothesis by a set of regressions
on haircuts and spreads. Not surprisingly, none of the collateral variables is related with
haircut or spread. Nor is the counter-party risk variable, which is measured as dealers’ CDS
spreads. For spreads, month dummies alone can explain close to 50% of the total variations.
Therefore, the variations in spreads are likely due to the time-series changes of the overall
credit market.

Conclusion

We collect a unique dataset of tri-party repo transactions between U.S. money market funds
and dealer banks. Taking advantage of the detailed collateral information in the dataset,
we examine the pricing in the tri-party repo market, focusing on the repos backed by equity
and corporate bonds which have rich pricing patterns. We find that pricing relies mostly
on haircuts and much less on rate spreads. Surprisingly, haircuts are largely decided by
the associated fund families and not by the dealers. Some fund families use counter-party
sensitive and collateral sensitive pricing schemes, but most of the fund families use uniform
haircuts. Among the uniform haircuts, there is substantial variation in the levels of haircuts
chosen by diﬀerent fund families. Facing various pricing schemes from diﬀerent fund families,
dealers behave simply like price-takers and do not shop around for the best haircuts. Instead,
they seem to value more about maintaining a stable relationship with their lenders. Repo
spread is determined mainly by the maturity and does not depend on the collateral or the
dealer’s credit risk. Compared with the equity and corporate bond repos, the pricing of
Treasury repos is much more homogeneous: the haircuts are unanimously set at 2% and the
repo rates follow closely with the Fed Fund Rates.

calculated as the value-weighted average rating of all rated corporate bonds in the collateral pool, weighed
by the collateral value of the individual securities. A corporate bond’ rating is a numerical translation of
Moodys rating, where 1=Aaa and 21=C.

This table reports the distributions of haircut, spread, maturity and size for equity, corporate bond and Treasury tri-party repos, from January
2005 to August 2013. The summary statistics for the period from January 2005 to June 2008, September 2008 to June 2009, and September
2009 to September 2010 are based on the repos collected from the quarterly filings of 102 U.S. money market funds. The summary statistics
for the period from November 2010 to August 2013 are based on the repos with matched collateral securities, collecting from the monthly
N-MFP filings of all U.S. money market funds. In addition to the distributions of repo characteristics, we also report the total number of
fund families (#FFs), the total number of money market funds (#MMFs), the total number of dealers (#dealers), the total number of repos
(#repos) and the total amount of repos in billions (amt) for each of the sample periods.

This table reports the distributions of haircut, spread, maturity and size for the sample of equity repos with matched collateral from November
2010 to August 2013. Panel A reports the summary statistics for each of the seven fund families. Panel B reports the summary statistics
for the top five dealers, ranked by the total equity repo amount. The top five dealers are JP Morgan (JPM), Credit Suisse (CS), Deutsche
Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Mizuho (MFG). In addition to the repo statistics, we also report the time-series mean and standard
deviation of the dealers’ 5-year CDS spreads in Panel B. The CDS spreads data are obtained from Markit. We don’t have Mizuho’s CDS
spreads since it is not covered by Markit.

This table reports the top 20 securities in the collateral pool of the equity tri-party repos from November
2010 to August 2013. For each security, we report the total amount (amount), the share of the entire
collateral pool (pct), the number of repos for which the security is used as collateral (#repos), the number
of months the security is used as collateral (#months), the number of fund families that accept the security
as collateral (#FFs) and the number of dealers that post the security as collateral (#dealers).

This table reports the summary statistics of the equity collateral for each of the seven fund families in the
equity repo market, from November 2010 to August 2013. We first calculate, for each equity repo, the
percentage of matched securities (matched), the number of collateral (#cols), the value-weighted number of
collateral (#cols (vw)), the value-weighted log firm size (size), the portfolio volatility (port vol), the valueweighted volatility (avg vol), and the proportion of financial firms (fin). The weights are individual security’s
collateral value. The value-weighted number of collateral (#cols (vw)) is calculated as the inverse of the
Herfindahl index based on the collateral value of individual securities. We then report the cross-sectional
mean, median and standard-deviation of repos for each fund family and the full sample.

This table summarizes, for each asset class, the top five fund families and their counter-parties. The summary statistics are based on the full
sample of repos from November 2010 to August 2013. The repos are classified into diﬀerent asset classes according to the reported collateral
type and collateral subtype. The fund families are ranked by the total amount of repo transactions during the sample period. For each fund
family at each month-end, we calculate its total repo amount, market share (%), the number of counter-parties (#dealers), the value-weighted
number of counter-parties (# vw dealers). The time-series mean and standard deviations are then reported in the table. We select the top
two dealers for each fund family, based on the total amount of repo transactions during the sample period. For each fund family - dealer pair,
we report the time-series mean and standard deviation of the repo amount (value) and the ratio out of the fund family’s total repos (ratio).
The dealers in the table are Credit Suisse (CS), JP Morgan (JPM), Barclays (BCS), Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS), Royal Bank
of Canada (RY), Wells Fargo (WFC), UBS (UBS), BNP Paribas (BNP), Citi Group (C), Credit Agricole (ACA), HSBC Holdings (HBC),
ABN AMRO (AMA) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).

This table summarizes, for each asset class, the top five dealers and their counter-parties. The summary statistics are based on the full sample
of repos from November 2010 to August 2013. The repos are classified into diﬀerent asset classes according to the reported collateral type and
collateral subtype. For each dealer at each month-end, we calculate its total repo amount, market share (%), the number of counter-parties
(# FFs), the value-weighted number of counter-parties (# vw FFs). The time-series mean and standard deviations are then reported in the
table. We select the top two fund families for each dealer, based on the total amount of repo transactions during the sample period. For
each fund family - dealer pair, we report the time-series mean and standard deviation of the repo amount (value) and the ratio out of the
dealer’s total repos (ratio). The dealers in the table are Credit Suisse (CS), JP Morgan (JPM), Barclays (BCS), Merill Lynch (MER), Bank
of America (BAC), Deutsche Bank (DB), Wells Fargo (WFC), UBS (UBS), BNP Paribas (BNP), and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).

This table reports the distribution of haircut, spread, maturity and size of the corporate bond tri-party repos, based on the monthly repo
data with matched collateral from November 2010 to August 2013. Panel A reports the summary statistics for the top ten fund families and
Panel B reports the summary statistics for the top ten dealers. The top ten dealers are JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BNP Paribas
(BNP), HSBC (HBC), Credit Suisse (CS), UBS (UBS), ING (ING), Deutsche Bank (DB), Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Barclays (BCS).
In addition to the repo statistics, we also report the time-series mean and standard deviation of the dealers’ 5-year CDS spreads in Panel B.
The CDS spreads data are obtained from Markit.

This table reports the summary statistics of the collateral posted for the corporate bond tri-party repos from
November 2010 to August 2013. For every corporate bond repo, we calculate the percentage of matched
securities (matched), the number of collateral (#cols), the value-weighted number of collateral (#cols (vw)),
the proportion of rated obnds (rated), the proportion of investment-grade bonds (IG), the value-weighted
bond rating (rating), the value-weighted age in years (age), the value-weighted maturity in years (maturity)
and the value-weighted log issuance size (issu. size). All the weights are the collateral value of the individual
securities. The value-weighted number of collateral (#cols (vw)) is the inverse of the Herfindahl index based
on the collateral value of the individual securities. We then report the cross-sectional mean, median and
standard-deviation for repos of each fund family and the full sample.

This table reports the OLS regressions on the haircuts of corporate bond tri-party repos from November
2010 to August 2013. We use two methods to classify investment grade and non-investment grade corporate
bond repos. The first one is by the average ratings of the underlying corporate bonds. The tri-party repos
with average ratings at Baa3 or better are considered as investment-grade repos; tri-party repos with average
ratings below Baa3 are considered as non-investment grade repos. The second method is by the percentage
of investment grade bonds in the collateral pool. The tri-party repos with more than 85% investment-grade
bonds in the collateral pool are considered as investment-grade repos; the tri-party repos with more than
85% non-investment grade bonds are considered as non-investment grade repos. The t-statistics reported in
squared brackets are based on the double-clustered standard errors clustered by fund family and month.

This table reports the summary statistics for the collateral posted for the Treasury tri-party repos from
November 2010 to August 2013. For each Treasury repo, we calculate the number of collateral (#cols),
the value-weighted number of collateral (#cols (vw)), the proportion of Treasury Bills (bill), the proportion
of Treasury Notes (note), the proportion of Treasury Bonds (bond), the value-weighted coupon in percentages (coupon), the value-weighted age in years (age), the value-weighted maturity in years (mat), the
value-weighted duration (duratn), and the value-weighted outstanding amount in billions (outamt) and the
percentage of on-the-run Treasuries. All the weights are the collateral value of the individual securities. The
value-weighted number of collateral (#cols (vw)) is the inverse of the Herfindahl index based on the collateral
value of the individual securities. We then report the cross-sectional mean, median and standard-deviation
for repos of each fund family and the full sample.

Repo Size ($M)

This table reports the distribution of haircut, spread, maturity and size of the Treasury tri-party repos, based on the monthly repo data with
matched collateral from November 2010 to August 2013. Panel A reports the summary statistics for the top ten fund families and Panel B
reports the summary statistics for the top ten dealers. The top ten dealers are Barclays (BCS), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Deutsche
Bank (DB), Credit Suisse (CS), BNP Paribas (BNP), Bank of America (BAC), HBSC (HBC), Credit Agricole (ACA), Societe Generale
(GLE) and Citi Group (C), respectively. In addition to repo statistics, we also report the mean and standard deviation of the dealers’ 5-year
CDS spreads in the Panel B. The CDS spreads data are obtained from Markit.

A

Repo Pricing Before November 2010

Since our monthly data starts only from November 2010, we complement it with the tri-party
repo transactions obtained from the annual (N-CSR), semi-annual (N-CSRS) and quarterly
(N-Q) filings of money market funds from January 2005 to September 2010. For these repo
transaction, we have basic repo information including the counter-parties, amount, haircut,
interest rate, maturity dates and the collateral asset class. However, the details of the
securities in the collateral pool are not reported. Without the collateral information, it is
impossible to perform the same analysis as we did for the monthly repo data with matched
collateral securities. Nevertheless, this data does provide some useful insights of the opaque
tri-party repo market before November 2010, especially during the financial crisis period.
Given the strong role played by fund families in repo pricing, we summarize these repos’
characteristics by each fund family for three diﬀerent time intervals: the pre-crisis period
from January 2005 to June 2008, the crisis period from June 2008 to June 2009, and the
post-crisis period from June 2009 to September 2010. The equity and corporate bond repos
are reported in Table AI. The Treasury repos are reported in Table AII. The distributions of
haircut, spread, size and maturity before November 2010 are also plotted in the time-series
of Figure 2.
Equity Repos
The tri-party equity repo market went through several diﬀerent phases from 2005 to 2010.
The median haircut is at 5% before September 2008, jumps sharply to 10% after Lehman’s
default, stays at the 10% level for approximately one year, and then decreases to 8% at the
end of 2009. Fidelity, which is the largest lender in our monthly data from November 2010
to August 2013, remains the largest lender for the period before November 2010.
Before the financial crisis, only two fund families, Fidelity and State Street, accept equity
as collateral for tri-party repos. Both fund families ask for more or less similar haircuts at
around 5%. The Fidelity funds account for approximately 60% of the total lending, and
the State Street funds account for the remaining 40%. During the financial crisis from
September 2008 and June 2009, Fidelity continues to accept equity collateral but asks for
higher haircuts. In contrast, State Street funds retreat completely from the equity tri-party
repo market during the crisis. When the repo market bounces back after the financial crisis,
56

Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley funds start to accept equity collateral for repo lending.
But in contrast to the high haircuts, at approximately 9%, demanded by Fidelity, both
Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley funds ask for only 5%.
In other words, fund families also play the key role in setting haircuts before November
2010. Moreover, there is substantial variations in the haircuts demanded by diﬀerent fund
families. This is similar to our observations for the period after November 2010. For repo
spread, the overall time-series trend suggests that spread on equity repos run up during the
financial crisis period, and has returned to its normal level since late 2009.
Corporate Bond Repos
It is diﬃcult to draw any concrete conclusions on corporate bond repos, as money market
funds often don’t disclose whether the collateral are investment grade or non-investment
grade. Nevertheless, the haircut distribution across fund families suggests that diﬀerent
families use diﬀerent policies on haircuts. Interestingly, we do find some fund families that
assign a fixed haircut for all of its repos. For example, Invesco funds charge a constant 5%
haircut, irrespective of the market condition, the counter-parties and the collateral. This
uniform haircut scheme is consistent with our findings based on the monthly data after
November 2010.
Treasury Repos
Consistent with the previous literature, Treasury repo haircut stays stable at approximately 2%, even during the 2008 financial crisis when the credit market is in turmoil. Repo
spread, on the other hand, shows an interesting time-series trend. Before the financial crisis,
the Treasury repo spread is usually slightly below zero, probably because lenders view repo
loans backed by high-quality Treasuries safer than the uncollateralized loans in the fed fund
market. At the first quarter of 2008, right after the collapse of Bear Stearns, the interest
rates on Treasury tri-party repos drop significantly below the fed fund rates, resulting in a
huge negative basis at around -120 bps. The repo spread then bounces back quickly in the
next quarter and has since fluctuated within a small range around zero.

This table reports the distributions of haircut, spread, maturity and size of the equity and corporate bond tri-party repos, based on the
quarterly filings of 102 U.S. money market funds from January 2005 to September 2010. We divide the sample period into three sub-periods,
January 2005 to June 2008, September 2008 to June 2009 and September 2009 to September 2010. Within each sub-period, we report the
repo statistics by each fund family.

This table reports the distributions of haircut, spread, maturity and size of the Treasury tri-party repos, based on the quarterly filings of 102
US money market funds from January 2005 to September 2010. We divide the sample period into three sub-periods, January 2005 to June
2008, September 2008 to June 2009 and September 2009 to September 2010. Within each sub-period, we report the repo statistics by each
fund family.
