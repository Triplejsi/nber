Dynamic Factor Models of Consumption, Hours and Income

ABSTRACT

This paper addresses two questions. First, what are the key
factors that affect a consumers lifetime budget constraint and
how do they evolve over the lifecycle? Second, how do consumers
respond to changes in these factors? We examine the permanent
income hypothesis and the Keynesian consumption model using a
dynamic factor model of consumption, hours, wag unemployment,
and income. We show that a quarterly dynamic factor r!odel with
restrictions on the lag structure may be used with annual panel
data to account for the fact that in many micro panel data sets
the variables relevant to a study are measured at different time
intervals and/or are aggregates for the calendar year. By using
several income indicators we are able to extend the panel data
studies of Hall and Mishkin and Bernanke to allow for measurement
error. We are also able to study the response of inc3me and
consumption to some of the factors which determine them. In
addition, we study a dynamic factor representation of a joint
lifecycle model of consumption and labor supply. We provide
estimates of the effect of wages, unemployment, and other income
determinants on the marginal utility of income as well as
estimates of the substitution effects of wage change on labor
supply and consumption.

INTRODUCTION

This paper addresses two longstanding questions in the economics of
intertemporal choice.

First, what are the key factors that affect a

consumer's lifetime budget constraint and how do they evolve over the
lifecycle? Second, how do consumers respond to changes in these factors?

These questions are closely related.

First, the lifecycle model of

consumer behavior treats work hours, which are a key determinant of income, as

an endogenous variable.

Consequently, as Ghez and Becker (1975) have

emphasized, the model of consumer behavior is part of the income model.
Second, even if one views the determinants of income as exogenous to the
consumer, as in most empirical research using Friedman's (1957) permanent
income model, the response of consumption to a change in the factors which

drive income should depend upon consumer beliefs about the size and
persistence of the changes.'

The application of the rational expectations

hypothesis to consumer behavior allows the econometrician to quantify consumer

expectations after specifying an income model.

The estimation of a dynamic

model of income and its economic factors permits one to study the responses of
consumers to expected and unexpected changes in these factors.

Despite these connections, substantial research on lifecycle models of

consumption, income and labor supply has been conducted without explicitly
modelling the behavior of wages, prices, and income.2 However some questions

cannot be answered without modelling the factors that determine the budget
constraint facing the individual.

If we want to estimate the response of

consumption and labor supply to changes in the marginal utility of income
induced by a typical wage, price or unemployment shock within the lifecycle
context, we need to model these processes. Little empirical research on these
consumption and labor supply responses has been conducted.

—2—
A few studies of the rational expectations—permanent income model have
estimated a joint model of consumption and income. In a path—breaking paper,

Sargent (1978) use aggregate time series data to estimate a rational
expectations permanent income model.

The innovative panel data studies of

Hall and Mishkin (1982) and Bernanke (1984) also estimated income and
consumption jointly.

In order to identify the response of consumption to

permanent and transitory income changes, they had to impose tight restrictions

on the form of the income process.

In particular, they had to assume that

income is measured without error. The assumption of no measurement error is
strong, as Hall and Mishkin recognized, since many of the variables in panel

data are widely believed to contain substantial measurement error.3
Unfortunately, inferences about consumer responses to income innovations are
likely to be sensitive to misspecification of the income process.

In this paper, we examine the permanent income hypothesis using a richer

model of the income process. Many micro data sets contain some measures of

income determinants, such as wage rates, hours worked, and hours of
unemployment.

These determinants provide leverage in estimating models of

consumption and income while allowing for measurement error in income.4
Furthermore, use of indicators of the determinants of income makes it possible

to identify some of the economic factors that drive income.5 Our analysis of
the income process builds upon earlier work and is of independent interest.6

In addition, we estimate a lifecycle model of consumption and labor
supply.

We focus on estimating the effects of wages, unemployment, and other

income determinants on the marginal utility of income. We also provide new
estimates of the intertemporal substitution effects of wage changes on labor
supply.

—3—
Our econometric models are vector moving average representations of the

consumption, hours, wages, unemployment, and income processes.

The

theoretical models place restrictions on the autocovariances and cross
covariances of these variables. We estimate a model's parameters by fitting

the theoretical covariances of the model to sample covariances that are
estimated from data using minimum distance estimators (Chamberlain (1984),
Hansen (1982)). The data are from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).

In conducting the empirical analysis, we pay special attention to four
econometric issues concerning model specification. First, we experiment with
different assumptions about measurement error. Second, we also provide tests
of a number of the restrictions embodied in our models.

Third, we attempt to account for the fact that in many micro panel data

sets, including the PSID, the variables relevant to a study are measured at

time intervals and/or are aggregates for the calendar year. For
example, in the PSID, individuals are interviewed at yearly intervals; The
consumption measure and the hourly wage measure refer to the time of the
different

survey

the

(typically in March)

while family income and hours unemployed refer to

calendar year which precedes the survey date. This non—syncronization and

time aggregation of the relevant variables is an important problem for
estimating and testing the permanent income and lifecycle models. We show how
quarterly dynamic factor models can be restricted with polynomial distributed
lag structures to cope with this problem.

A fourth set of issues arises because the conventional CM—square tests
largely reject the hypothesis that the data are covariance stationary. That
is, the tests reject the hypothesis that the covariances are the same for each
year.

This finding is typical of previous studies of income (see, for

example, Hause (1980), Kearl (1985), Abowd and Card (1986)).

The finding

—4—
poses a potential problem because the structural models may be unidentified if

the non—stationarity cannot be easily parameterized. For our sample, when we
allowed for simple parameterizations of non—stationarity of the data or when

we used dummy variables for specific moments to control for the strongest

departure from stationarity, we obtained estimates of the structural
parameters which do not differ much from those where we made no allowance for
non—stationarity. We also provide evidence that the rejection of stationarity

may be due partly to imprecision in our estimate of the fourth moment matrix
of the data, which is used for both inference and efficient estimation.
Our main substantive findings are the following.
1.

Changes in consumption, hours, income, wages, and unemployment are

not normally distributed.

Inference based on the assumption of normality,

which is imposed in a number of previous studies, is likely to overstate the

precision of the estimates. Even with our sample size, 1051 individuals, it
is difficult to obtain precise estimates of structural dynamic factor models
using the PSID data.
2.

In general, the zero restrictions implied by the permanent income

model on the covariance structure of the data are

not

rejected. There is some

evidence, although quantitatively small, that lagged unemployment and income

factors affect the change in consumption when we estimate the model without
transforming the data.

After transforming the data into logs, there is no

evidence that lagged factors affect the change in consumption7. We interpret
this lack of robustness and the quantitative magnitudes involved as supportive
of the permanent income hypothesis.

3. There is substantial measurement error in measured income in all our

models (45% —

75%

of the variance of the change in measured income).

The

lower estimates are based on models that account for non—syncronization in the

data. We are less successful in obtaining precise estimates of measurement

—5—
error in measured wages and work hours. A number of our point estimates are
negative. We find only weak evidence against the hypothesis that measurement
error is white noise.
4.

After accounting for measurement error in measured income,

innovations in the wage, unemployment and work hours explain surprisingly
little of the remaining variance in the change in family income. This lack of

explanatory power is consistent with results which we obtain using regression

techniques to describe the data.

However the result still suggests

misspecification of the income model. When we account for non—syncronization

In the data, the explanatory power of the economic variables determining
income improves.
5.

We could not get a precise estimate of the discount factor used by

consumers to discount their projected income flows. Estimates range from —.04
to 1.6. The more reasonable point estimates are obtained after accounting for

non—sycronization in the data. The imprecision may be attributed to the lack
of precision in our estimates of the consumption response to unemployment and

work hours innovations, and in our estimates of the response of income to
lagged innovations in wages and income, and possible misspecification of the

income process. We obtained estimates of the marginal propensity to consume

food out of permanent income in the range of .036 to .067. We had similar
difficulties getting a precise estimate of the discount factor with the Hall
and Mishkin model.

6. The Keynesian model was consistently rejected by the data.
7.

We show that it is feasible to estimate quarterly models of

intertemporal choice with non—syncronized annual panel data by restricting the
quarterly lag structures to polynomial functions.

We find that the zero restrictions implied by the lifecycle model are

not rejected. However, we obtain a small and imprecise negative estimate of

the intertemporal labor supply elasticity.

We also obtain a small and

imprecise negative estimate of the cross substitution elasticity.

However, the null

hypothesis of intra period separability of consumption and leisure cannot be
rejected.

9. We provide an estimate of the total variance of the innovation in the
marginal utility of income.

Wage and unemployment innovations together

explain over 40% of the total variance. Wage innovations are responsible for
most of this variance.

The paper proceeds as follows.

Section 1 provides an overview of the

dynamic factor models studied in the paper.

nonsynchronization in estimating such models. Section 4 discusses estimation
methods and the data. In Section 5 we discuss the estimates of the covariance

stationary model, the properties of the income process, and estimates of the

permanent income and the Keynesian consumption models.

• DYN&MIC FACTOR MODELS OF CONSUMPTION, INCOME ANT) HOURS: AN OVERVIEW

This

paper estimates various dynamic factor models of consumption, income

and hours. We use the real wage and unemployment as additional indicators of

factors which drive these variables.8 Throughout the paper, L is the first
difference operator, C is consumption at t, Y is real family income at t, W
is the real wage at t, Z is annual hours of unemployment at t for the head of

—7
household, and N is the head's annual work hours at t.

For notational

convenience, subscripts for individuals are left implicit. For X=C,W,Y,Z, and

N, X* is the measure of X at t.

We estimate models using first differences

of the levels of the variables and models using first differences of the logs

of the variables (we note one exception to this when the case arises). In
analyzing the RE—lifecycle model, we replace '

with

labor earnings of the

head of household ''t• For convenience, when it does not cause confusion, we
refer to the first difference of the variable as the variable itself.

We analyse consumption, hours and income using various dynamic factor
models that are nested in the following general model:

Equations (1.ld) and (1.le) specify that wages W* and unemployment

Equation (1.la) specifies that consumption C' depends on the current

The above model cannot be estimated with our data. Instead we consider
smaller models whose restrictions are implied by various economic models of

consumption and hours.

For each economic model, we first test the zero

restrictions implied by the theory against a model which imposes only
covariance stationarity on the data.

Then we estimate the economic model,

test the overidentifying restrictions against larger factor models and also
models which only impose covariance stationarity, and evaluate the parameter
estimates.

Without futher ado we turn to the permanent income and the

Keynesian models.

2. THE RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS-PERMANENT INCOME AND KEYNESIAN MODELS

The

starting point for the rational expectations permanent income (RE—Fl)

model is the consumption change equation:

Et

(1 + interest rateY1

expectation operator conditional on information available at t
income of individual at t
permanent income conditional on information at t

Equation (2.1) states that the change in consumption of an individual is
directly proportional to the change in permanent income. This equation can be

derived rigorously from utility maximization (Hall (1978), Hall and Mishkin

(1982)) only under very strong assumptions about the utility function, the
behavior of unobserved preference shifters over time, and uncertainty about
wages, nonlabor income, and interest rates. We prefer to interpret equation

(2.1) as an approximation or as a basic assumption about behavior (as in
Sargent (1978) and Flavin (1981)). Equation (2.1) is invalid if substitution

effects of wage changes and interest rate movements are important for
consumption.

For empirical work, equation (2.1) must be modified in two ways. The
first modification is needed because the principal consumption measure in our

data set is family expenditure on food. The marginal propensity to consume
food out of permanent income is not unity.

The second modification is to

allow for preference related transitory consumption changes and measurement

error in the consumption data, which we assume to follow a moving average
process.

(In this paper, measurement error in consumption is not identified

separately from transitory consumption.) We also assume that the measurement

error in consumption is uncorrelated with the other variables used in our
study.

With these two modifications, measured consumption is related to

permanent income by:

(Et —

Et..i)Yt+i

÷ Uct ÷ (A—l)ut_i —

Aut_2

Equation (2.3) cannot be estimated directly because the revision in
expected wealth is unobserved.

Therefore the RE—PI model can be estimated

only by adding a model for income.

Within both the RE—PI model and the Keynesian model, labor supply and
family income are determined independently of consumption. Consequently, to

analyze these models, we restrict the hours equation of the general income
model in (1.lc) as follows

Exogenous Work Hours Equatioq (N*t):

(1.lc') N*t =

8nnOhmnt

+

+ 8nn2%t2 + 8nzO1zt + 8nz1Izt_1

+ nz21zt_2 + nt

We will refer to the income model consisting of equation (1.lc') for hours and
equations (1.lb, 1.ld, 1.le) for income, wages and unemployment as the "income

model with exogenous hours".

The only difference between the above income

model and the general income model is that the current and lagged values of
the wage factor

and the income factor uyt are not included in the hours

equation (1.lc'). These zero restrictions will be tested.

Given the above income model, the RE—PI consumption model implies two
sets of restrictions on the general consumption equation (1.la).

First, it

implies that the change in consumption only depends on the contemporaneous
factors affecting income:

An advantage of using dynamic factor models of income with multiple
indicators is that various factors are allowed to have different effects on
income, and consequently should have different effects on consumption.

For

exaniple, if the estimates of the equations of the income process indicates
that unemployment has only a temporary effect on income, then the RE—PI model

implies that unemployment has only a small effect on consumption. Since the
parameters a and p are overidentified, one may test whether the response of

consumption to particular factors affecting income is consistent with the
pernianent income model.

It is also clear that one can only hope to get valid

estimates a and P if the income model is correctly specified. Here again, the

use of multiple indicators is an advantage because some of the factors
determining income are now identified with observable quantities (e.g. the
wage factor), and we can use apriori information to judge how reasonable the
estimated income model is.

— 13 —

An

alternative to

the RE—PI model is

the Keynesian model of

consumption. We can use the same income process as specified In (1.lb). The
consumption change equation must be respecified as:

where Uct and its lags reflect both variation in consumption preferences and

measurement error in consumption.

The Keynesian model also implies strong

restrictions on the covariances between cousumption and the other variables in

the model.

While the Keynesian model and the RE—Fl model are not nested

models, they are both nested in the model consisting of the general
consumption model (1.la) and the income model with exogenous hours (1.lb,
1.lc', 1.ld, 1.le).

We estimate the general consumption equation, the RE—PI equation, and the

Keynesian equation using the first differences of the levels (actual values)
of the variables.

To facilitate comparison to our analysis of the lifecycle

consumption and labor supply model below,

we also estimate the general

consumption equation and the Keynesian equation using the changes in the logs

of the variables. Unfortunately, the RE—Fl restrictions on the response of
consumption to the innovations in the log linear income process are extremely
complicated and involve family wealth. Consequently, it does not appear to be
feasible to estimate the RE—Fl model with a loglinear income process.

TIME AGGREGATION AND NONSYNCERONOUS MEASUREMENTS:
THE QUARTERLY DYMANIC FACTOR MODEL

many micro panel data sets, the variables relevant to a study may be

measured at different time intervals. For example, in the PSID, individuals
are interviewed at yearly intervals. The consumption measure and the hourly

wage measure refer to the time of the survey (typically in March or April)

while family income and hours unemployed refer to the calendar year which
precedes the survey date. This poses a problem because the inconsistency of
the timing may weaken the relationship between the change in family income and

the change in the wage.

Futherinore, the differences in the timing of the

consumption, wage, income, and unemployment variables may affect the estimates

of the relative response of consumption to the various factors which drive
income, particularly since consumption should not respond to lagged income
innovations if the RE—PI is correct. Since the consumption change is measured

a few months after the income change measure, part of u may be past
information. Consequently, estimates of the response of consumption to the
income factor u,, may be understated. (Many tests of the RE—PI model hinge on

the issue of timing of information about income. See the surveys by Hayashi
(1985a) and King(1985)).

In addition, the use of annual values rather then

the unavailable quarterly values may cause problems.

Hall and Mishkin (1982) recognized the problem of nonsynchronization in

their data and they made adjustments within the annual framework of their

model to deal with the problem.

However their approach is difficult to

generalize to other models. First, the adjustments that should be made to a

particular annual model may not be obvious.

Second, modifications of an

annual model may imply unreasonable restrictions on the underlying quarterly
model.9

— 15 —

We

treat the problems of nonsynchronous timing and time aggregation by

specifying quarterly dynamic factor series models for the determinants of
consumption and income, and aggregating where this is appropriate. Given the
inherent data limitations, we impose Alinon (1962) polynomial distributed lag
structures on the coefficients of the quarterly dynamic factor models.

Our model is as follows. Let

In the model above, the data are generated at a quarterly rate (1 runs

from Z in the i—l'st quarter of year t is a seventh order moving average
process (a two year process).

consecutive data as defined in (3.3), then the model of (3.1) as restricted by

(3.2) and (3.4) can be estimated.

The differences in timing and aggregation

of the different variables help identify the quarterly lag structure from
annual observations. The model implieé that several of covariances at 3 year
lags will be nonzero, and so we add the relevant moments to the set of sample
moments used in estimation.

4. MT& AND ECONOMETRIC METHODOLOGY

The structural parameters of the models are estimated by fitting the
theoretical auto—covariances and cross—covariances implied by the models to

the corresponding sample moments of the variables.

Chamberlain (1984)

contains a comprehensive discussion of these estimators.'°
The estimation procedure minimizes a quadratic form
(S—E(fl ))'S2(S—(JI))

where S is the vector of distinct sample covariance elements, (1I) is the
vector of predicted covariance elements, considered as a function of the

— 18 —

vector

of parameters II (e.g. ijk'g and a1's in (1.2)).

2 is the identity

matrix in the case of unweighted least squares estimates, and a consistent
estimate of the inverse of the fourth moment matrix of the underlying data in
the case of optimal minimum distance estimates (OMD).

In practice, we follow

a number of previous studies and use the inverse of the empirical fourth
moment matrix of the underlying data, V, when computing OMD estimates.

The

unweighted least squares case amounts to running a nonlinear regression of the

individual sample covariances in S against the elements of E(It). The optimal
minimum distance estimator (OMD) is analogous to fitting thIs relationship by
generalized least squares.

We use the OMD estimator rather than maximum likelihood under the
assumption of normality, which was used by Hall and Mishkin and Bernanke. We

do so because our preliminary data analysis, for both levels and logs,
indicated that the data are non—normal.

Specifically, we calculated the

Kolmogorov—Smfrnov test stalistic for the null hypothesis of normality for
each variable in each year (

e.g.

ic1979). The null hypothesis was rejected

in every case at a marginal significance level less than .01. We also found
that the empirical fourth moment of a given variable, Xt, varies from 1.5 to

10 times larger than 3*(var(xt))2 even though these quantitites should be
approximately equal if x Is normally distributed.

Unfortunately, there are also drawbacks to the OMD estimator.

In

particular, we will present evidence that, for our problem, the sample
estimate V of the fourth moment matrix is imprecise. Furthermore, sampling
error in the fourth moments is likely to be correlated with sampling error in
the second moments.

If this is true, it may be preferable to use a simpler

weighting scheme to estimate the models than the full GLS transformation used

in the OMD case.

For this reason, we also estimate our models with the

— 19 —

diagonal elements of 2 set to the inverse of the average of the diagonal
elements of V corresponding to a given type of covariance (e.g., the variance

of the Income change, the covariance of the wage change with the consumption

change, etc.).11 In this case all off diagonal elements of 2 are set to 0.
This amounts to fitting the model by a form of weighted least squares, which

hereafter we will refer to as WLS.

The average of the estimated fourth

moments for the various years corresponding to each of the moments in equation
(2.9) is used as the weight for the particular moments.

Chamberlain shows how tests of parameter restrictions can be conducted

Let E(S) = EOI), where the vector It has

valid when WLS rather than OMD is used.

The least restricted model that can be estimated is the non—stationary
model in which each moment in S is given its own parameter. In this case ZOT)

and S have the same dimension.

All covariance stationary models which we

experimented with are overwhelmingly rejected against this model.

As a second bench mark, and to provide a convenient data summary, we also
use the covariance stationary model

Covariance Stationary Model
(4.1)

Coy (I*t,tM*t+j)

0IMj

I,M = C,Y,W,Z,N;

j=—2,—1,0,1,2.

We use the covariance stationary model as a second bench mark against

which to judge the fit of the structural models, for two related reasons.
First, tests based upon the test statistic above using the empirical fourth

moment matrix to form the x2

statistic

indicate that the data are non—

stationary in the covariances. Therefore our various economic models will be
rejected just due to the fact that they are stationary models. Second, there
are indications that the fourth moment matrix may be too imprecisely estimated

to permit reliable tests of the restricted models against the nonstationary
model using the test procedure discussed above.

We conducted the following

experiment to get a sense of whether the imprecision in our estimate of the
fourth moments may have an effect on tests of stationarity.

For the data in the levels, we randomly divided our sample of 1051
individuals into two subsamples, A and B.

Consequently, the sample moments

for the two subsamples have the same distribution. For the two subsamples, we

calculated two separate fourth moment matrices,

VA and VB,

for use as an

estimate of the variance of the second moments for the subsample.

We used

them to test the hypothesis that the expectations of the second moments of
our subsamples are equal, without imposing stationarity across years.

The

test statistic indicated rejection of this hypothesis, which is true by
construction, at the .003 level. In contrast, when we used the fourth moment

matrix from the full sample to form the V matrix for both subsamples, the
hypothesis that the subsamples have the same second moments easily passes.

— 21 —

Furthermore, when we used the common V matrix estimated from the full sample
to compute OMD estimates of separate stationary models from the moments in the

two subsamples, the

statistic with 314 degrees of freedom to test

stationarity is 440.3. When we use VA and VB, the corresponding
is 570.9.

statistic

We conclude that the estimates of the fourth moments may have a

substantial effect on the test statistic for stationarity.

The results for

the data in logs were similar although the discrepancies were less dramatic.

Of course, these findings do not provide a clear indication of whether the

problems which arise when the same sample of 526 observations is used to
compute both the second moments and V carry over to a sample of 1051. But in
view of these results, it seems sensible to also judge the performance of our
structural models against the covariance stationary model.

Our use of stationary structural models in the face of evidence of
nonstationarity raises the possibility of inconsistency in the estimates of

the parameters of income and consumption equations.

We checked this in

several ways. First, we estimated models in which the variance of u, Uyt
unt, u, and Uwt were permitted to depend on a common year specific scalar.
This typically resulted in a significant improvement in the fit of the models

(although the modified models were also overwhelmingly rejected against the
unrestricted nonstationary model). However, the response coefficients of the

income equations and the consumption equation did not change very much. We
experimented with other ways of introducing nonstationarity into the dynamic

factor models, with little change in the estimates of the income and
consumption equations despite improvements in the fit of the model.
Second, we introduced dummy variables for the moments for which there was

a significant departure (at the .05 level) from stationarity.

This is

analogous to excluding these moments from the analysis. We identified these

— 22

moments

—

using a step—wise regression procedure to estimate the stationary
The procedure resulted in the introduction of dummy variables for

about 6 percent of the moments.

The fit of the dynamic factor models

generally improved to the point where they cannot be rejected against the
unrestricted nonstationary model.

More importantly, the parameters of the

consumption and income equation are basically similar to those which we report
below.

Our findings are consistent with those of Kearl (1985) and Hause

(1980), who found that relaxing stationarity improved the fit of their models
of labor earnings but had little effect on key parameters.

Consequently, we have evidence that our inferences about the form of the

income process and the consumption equation are valid despite the fact that
the

stationary dynamic factor models are rejected against the nonstationary

model.

Our reported standard errors of the parameter estimates are based on a
modification of the formula provided in Chamberlain (1984). Chamberlain's
formula

is valid under the assumption that the discrepancy between the fitted

covariances and the sample covariances arise only from sampling error in the
covariances.

Since the x2 goodness of fit tests discussed below indicate

model misspecification, it seemed appropriate to scale the standard errors up
by a factor equal to the square root of the mean square error of the estimated

residuals of the models.

The formula in Chamberlain assumes that the mean

square error of the estimated residuals for the OMD estimator is one.

It

leads to standard error estimates for the model parameters which typically are

about one third smaller than the ones we report.

To make our standard error

estimates comparable to those of other studies (e.g., Ahowd and Card (1985,

1986), one may divide them by the square root of the mean square error
reported in the Tables.

We are, of course, on shaky ground in performing

— 23 —

statistical

inference in the presence of model misspecification. This is one

reason to prefer the conservative standard errors which we report.

Data

For most of the analysis the data are from the 1976—1981 Panel Study of

Income Dynamics individuals tape (See Survey Research Center (1982)).
Consequently, in first

differences,

data are available for five years. For a

given year, the sample contains male heads of household who were between the
ages 18—60 inclusive, who had not retired, and who were employed, temporarily

laid off or unemployed at the time of the survey.

We have limited the

analysis to these years because the wage measure is unavailable for salaried
workers prior to 1976. In the balanced sample, an individual is included only

if he has complete observations on all the variables for all the years. The
sample contains 1051 individuals. Because the wage measure is collected only

if the individual is employed or on temporary layoff at the time of survey,

the balanced sample is likely to consist of individuals with more stable
employment histories than the sample at large. We experiment with unbalanced
samples for 1976—1981 and for 1969—1981 as well.

A few of the variables require discussion. C* is the sum of the family's

food expenditures at home and outside of the home, deflated by the food
component of the consumer price index. This is the consumption measure used
in Hall and Mishkin (1982), Altonji (1986), Altonji and Siow (1988), and other

recent studies of lifecycle models based on the PSID.

There appears to be

considerable measurement error in the variable. We account for it with the
error component

The variable W* is the change in the straight time wage at the time of
the survey. Given our assumptions about measurement error, it is important to

— 24 —

note that for both hourly workers and salary workers this wage variable is
based upon survey questions which are independent of those used to construct

iY*, family income. For salaried workers measurement error in iW*t may be
correlated with the true change in work hours, since the variable is usually

imputed from information on salary per week, per month, or per year using a

standard number of work hours (such as 40 hours per week). We ignore this
potential problem.

As noted earlier, the consumption measure and the hourly wage measure
refer to the time of the survey (typically in March) while family income and

hours of unemployment, Z*, refer to the calendar year which precedes the
survey date.

For computational convenience, we followed Hall and Mishkin (1982) and

Hayashi (1985b) and removed the effects of economy wide disturbances and a
variety of demographic characteristics from the variables used in the analysis

of the dynamic factor models.

We do so by first regressing the change in

consumption, the change in income, and the income determinants against a set

of year dummies, age, age2, age3, education, the change in a dummy variable
for marital status, current and lagged values of dummy variables for 8 Census
regions, residence in an SMSA, and residence in a city with more than 500,000
people, as well as variables for the level and squared value of the change of
family size, the change in the number of children in the family unit, and the

change in the number of children under age 6.

The residuals from these

regressions form the basis for the analysis below. Given the large samples

which were used to form the residuals, the fact that the estimation was
performed in two stages is of little consequence.

— 25 —

When analyzing the models using changes in the levels (as opposed to the

changes in logs) of consumption and income, we followed Bernanke (1984) in
attempting a correction for the fact that the variances of the changes in the

level of income and consumption are strongly related to the level of income.

We split our sample into 13 income classes based upon the 6 year average of

annual income for each family.

We then divided the change in the income

levels, the change in the consumption level, and the change in the wage level

by the mean of the averages for the families in a given class. Essentially,
this imposes the assumption that the variances of all of the factors except

those of unemployment and work hours are proportional to the square of the
mean income level in the income class.

Note that the effect of changes in

work hours or unemployment on the change in the family income level should
depend on the wage. To allow for this, we did not deflate the hours change or
the unemployment variable by the mean income level, under the assumption that
the mean wage level of individuals in the income class is proportional to the
mean family income level.
Finally, we have eliminated some outliers from the analysis.12

5. RESULTS FOR THE PERMANENT INCOME AND KEYNESIAN MODELS

In

Section 5.1 we begin with the estimates of the stat onary model (4.1)

in levels and logs and tests of the 0 restrictions on the stationary model
that are implied by the income model and by the RE—PT consumption equation.

In Section 5.2 we report estimates of the income equations of the dynamic
factor model, the PIN and Keynesian consumption equations. In Section 5.3 we
discuss a number of extentions, including the use of weighted least squares,

experiments with alternative assumptions about measurement error,

and

estimates obtained when we extended the sample to years prior to 1976 and to

— 26 —

individuals

who are missing data for some years. In Section 5.4, we present

estimates of the quarterly dynamic factor models. Estimates of the Hall and
Mishkjn Model are in Section 5.5.

5.1 Estimates and Tests of the Stationary Model and the Unrestricted Dynamic
Factor Models

This section presents OMD estimates of the stationary model (4.1) in
levels and logs and tests of the 0 restrictions on the stationary model which

are implied by the income model and by the RE—PI consumption equation. Table
Ia presents the OMD estimates of the stationary model (4.1) when the data are

in levels.

It consists of the covariances among the variables

iZ* and N*t at 0, 1, and 2 lags. The model contains parameters for
65 distinct covariances which we estimate from 250 second moments. The signs

of the contemporaneous covariances seem reasonable.

One distinguishing

feature is that the covariances at the second lags are small for almost all of

the variables.

Out of 25 such covariances, only Cov(Y*t, Y*t2) is

statistically significant. Furthermore, the estimates of the covariances are
somewhat imprecise despite the fact that data on 1,051 individuals and between

3 and 5 sample moments are used to estimate thetni3

Furthermore, the

covariances of hours, wage, and unemployment with income are

small

at second

order lags. The small values for these covariances and the imprecision in the

estimates of the moments causes problems for estimation of the restricted
models. Identification in these models utilizes the covariances at the second
lags.

of the test.

The column labels indicate the restrictions

maintained under the alternative hypothesis.

The first column tests the

stationary models against the unrestricted nonstationary model (which fits the

sample moments perfectly). The x2 statistic for the stationary model with no

further restrictions is 307.7 with 185 degrees of freedom, which is large

enough to reject stationarity with a p—value of less than .0001

We also

tested separately for stationarity of the autocovariances of each of the five
variables.

For levels, we reject stationarity for work hours, wages and

unemployment. For logs, we reject stationarity for all variables except for

work hours. As we noted earlier, stationarity of the data is also strongly
rejected for all models estimated using OMD in this paper (except in two cases

discussed in Section 5.5).

For reasons discussed in Section 4, we use the

stationary model as a yardstick to assess the restricted models.

Because the income model with exogenous hours excludes the wage factor

from the hours and unemployment equations, it implies the following zero
restrictions on the stationary model.

0 Restrictions on Coy. Stationary Model Implied by Income Equations 1.c', 1.d,

We report tests of these restrictions in the second row of the table. The p—

value is .029 when the data are in levels.

Inspection of the individual

sample moments indicates that none of the covariances among the wage and
unemployment are significant, but the hours change has a significant negative
covariance with the wage change and a positive covariance with the lagged wage

— 28 —

change.

Note that the lifecycle model of consumption and labor supply implies

that wages and hours should vary together.

In addition, since the RE—PI model implies that past information does not

cause a change in permanent income, it implies the following restrictions on
the stationary model.

Zero Restrictions on Coy. Stationary Model Implied by RE—PI Consumption
Equation

Coy (C*t,I*t_j) — 0

I = Y,W,Z,N; j—1,2

The third row of the table tests these restrictions. They pass easily when
stationarity is maintained.

The fourth row tests the zero restrictions on the income process and the

o restrictions implied by RE—PI for consumption. We obtained a p—value of

.038 for these restrictions when testing them against the unrestricted
stationarity model. This rejection at conventional significance levels is due
to the restrictions on the income process.

Finally, the table reports a test against the unrestricted stationary
model (4.1) of the factor model consisting of the unrestricted consumption
equation (1.la) and the income model with exogenous hours.

The p—value to

reject is .057, and so there is only weak evidence against the factor
structure once stationarity is maintained.

The p—value for this dynamic

factor model is .334 when tested against the stationary model including 0
restrictions on the income process.

In summary, we find overwhelming evidence against stationarity, weaker
evidence against the assumption that unemployment and hours do not vary with
the wage change, little evidence against the RE—PI -zero restrictions on the

— 29 —

relationship

between consumption and lagged income determinants, and little

evidence against the dynamic factor representation of the data.

Table lb reports estimates of the unrestricted stationary model when the

data are in logs. Note that for this specification LZ*t is the log of (2,000

+ Hours

of unemployment) and is not in first differences. (Using first

differences did not change the results in the cases we checked.) For the log

results the standard errors are usually smaller relative to the parameter
estimates than for the level results. Once again, most of the covariances at

the second lag are small relative to the covariances between the same
variables at lags 0 and 1. (Only 3 out of 25 are significant at the 5% level.)

Table 2b reports a series of

tests of the restrictions on the

stationary model against various alternatives.

Column 1 of the Table shows

that stationarity is overwhelmingly rejected. However, once stationarity is

imposed, the restriction that wages do not vary with hours or unemployment
passes at the .127 level. The 0 restrictions implied by the RE—Fl model also

pass easily.

The p—value for the dynamic factor model consisting of the

income model with exogenous hours and the unrestricted consumption equation is

.097 in a test against the unrestricted stationary model. The p—value is .199

against the stationary model including 0 restrictions on the relationship
between wages and hours.

In summary, once stationarity is imposed, the log results provide weak
evidence against the income specification, but little evidence against the RE—
Fl 0 restrictions or against the dynamic factor representation of the data.

5.2 Estimates of the Dynamic Factor Models with Exogenous Income

We now discuss estimates of the dynamic factor models with exogenous
income and hours, and various consumption equations.

We begin with the

— 30 —

equations of the income model (1.lb, l.lc', 1.ld, 1.le). We then turn to the
consumption equations.

In estimating these models we have excluded the

covariances between hours and wages and between unemployment and wages from
the sample, because the income model implies these are 0.

In Table 3 we present estimates of the equations of the income model with

exogenous hours which are obtained when they are estimated jointly with the
unrestricted consumption equation (1.2). The estimates of the family income,
hours,

wage,

and unemployment equations

reported in the table are

representative of the results which we obtained for the income equations when

the restrictions associated with RE—PI or the Keynesian model were imposed,

although the precision of the coefficients on the income factor

and Uyt_2 is higher in the latter cases.

Uyt_1

The long run effect of a one

standard deviation innovation in one of the factors may be estimated by
summing the factor loadings on that factor.

The results for both logs and levels indicate that most of the response
of income to a wage innovation occurs in the initial period, and that most of
the effect is permanent. Because the data in levels have been deflated by the
mean income values in each of 13 income classes (see section 4), the estimates

for logs are somewhat easier to interpret. The log results indicate that a

one standard deviation increase in the wage factor, which is equal to .20
leads to a permanent increase in family income of about 2%.

This

seems small given that a one standard deviation shock to the wage raises the

wage level by about 7 % in the long run, and the evidence presented earlier

indicates that the relationship between wages and work hours is weak.
Inconsistency in the timing of wages and income is a possible explanation for
the small response of family income to wages. We investigate this possibility
below.

It is also worth mentioning that the standard error on the wage

— 31

measurement error variance

—

is large relative to the total variance in the

wage change, and that the point estimate is actually negative (although not
significant).

The estimate of —.0169 for 8yzO in the log equation is the short run

effect on the income change of a one standard deviation increase in the
unemployment factor ut.

This factor drives the log of (2000 + hours of

unemployment) and the change in the log of annual hours. The effect on annual

work hours is —.037, while the effect on the unemployment variable is .0296.

These results suggest that unemployment leads to a more than proportional
reduction in work hours in the short run, perhaps through shorter work days,

and to a less than proportional reduction in family income.

The long run

effect of unemployment on family income is near 0 for the log model.

It is

about half of the short run effect when levels are used.

The short run effect of the work hours factor

on the log of family

income is only about 1/4 of its effect on work hours. The log model implies

that more than 3/4 of the effect on income is permanent, while the level
results imply that slightly more than half of the positive short run effect is
permanent.

We obtain a small positive estimate of the variance of the

measurement error component in hours,

when logs are used, and a small

negative estimate when levels are used. These estimates come as a surprise,
because Duncan and Hill (1984), Altonji (1986) and Altonji and Paxson (1986)
report strong evidence of substantial measurement error in the change in the
log of annual hours. Below we obtain larger measurement error estimates when
we use WLS and when we account for nori—syncronization in the data.

The income factor

has a strong effect on income.

In all of the

models that we estimated, it was the most important factor in the income model

(after measurement error).

The estimates of the log model imply that

In Table 4 we provide some evidence that these results reflect basic

characteristics of the data rather than gross model misspecification or
problems with the estimation procedures. In column 1 we present a regression

is .115. In

column 2 we add current and lagged wage, hours and unemployment changes. The
R2 rises by .067 to .182. In column (3) we add the current value and two lags
of zNS*t, which is the change in the log of 1370 plus annual work hours of the

spouse to the equation. We also add ZS and its lags, where ZS* is the log
of 1370 plus wife's hours of unemployment.

The value 1370 is the mean of

wife's work hours for wives who work positive hours. (We transformed the work

hours and unemployment variables to reduce the influence of large percentage
changes in hours worked by women working few hours on the log variables and to

handle the fact that our sample includes unmarried men and men whose wives do

not work in some years).

These variables lead to an R2 of .297.

We view

these results as consistent with substantial measurement error in family
income. They also suggest a relatively small role for variation in husband's

— 33 —

work hours, unemployment, and wages in the variance of measured income. The
results in Altonji and Siow (1986) for a similar sample of men suggest that
adding the change in work hours lost due to illness and interactions between
wage changes and quits, layoffs, and promotions would result in only a small
improvement in explanatory power.

In light of the substantial explanatory

power of wife's work hours and unemployment, it may be useful in future work
to expand the dyanamic factor model to include these variables.

The Consumption Equations: Results for Levels

Table 5 reports a series of consumption equations. The

statistic and

the degrees of freedom reported at the bottom of each equation are for a test

of the consumption equation and the associated equations for the income
determinants against a stationary model (Model B in Table 2a).

Column 1 of Table 5 reports the estimates of the unrestricted consumption

values

of 2.07 and 1.75

This is evidence against the implication of the RE—Fl model

that lagged income and unemployment factors should not affect current
consumption.

It comes as a surprise in view of our finding in the previous

section that the 0 covariance restriction between consumption and lagged
income determinants are satisfied.

In column 2 we report the consumption function when the consumption
coefficients on the lagged income determinants are set to 0.

Interestingly,

— 34 —

the p—value to reject the model against the stationary model (model B) is more
than .10. However, when we maintain the factor model for income and only test
the consumption restrictions against the unrestricted consumption function in
column 1, they are rejected at the .025 level. The coefficients on all of the

income components have the right sign, but only the wage and income factors
are statistically significant. The coefficient cwO is 14.5, which is 2/5 the
size of 8cyO

From the perspective of the RE—Fl model, this estimate of

seems a bit large given that the estimates of the income model estimated
jointly with column (2) imply that the long run effect on income of a one
standard deviation shock to

deviation shock to

Column 3 in Table 5 presents estimates of the five variable restricted
RE—PI model.

The restrictions, when tested against the stationarity model,

are not rejected at the .10. However, they are rejected at the 5% level when
tested against the model with the unrestricted consumption equation in model
1.

The estimate of

a, the marginal propensity to consume food out of

permanent income, is .0672 with a standard error of .0215. Unfortunately, the

estimate for the discount factor, p, is —.044 with a standard error of .398.

Given the large standard error, a reasonable discount factor cannot be
rejected.

With other specifications of the model in levels (allowing for

different variables and measurement errors), we still could not pin down the

estimate of the discount factor. Often we obtained discount factors slightly
larger than 1 with large standard errors.

Part of the problem is that only

the wage and income innovations are significant in determining consumption.
The other problem is that the lags of the innovations of wages and income on
the income process are not determined precisely.

income model (not shown) and the coefficients on Uct Uct_1 and uct_2 are
similar to those for the RE—PI models.

However the Keynesian model, when

tested against the stationarity model, is rejected with a p—value of .01. It

is rejected at the .005 level when tested against the factor model with the
unrestricted consumption equation. All variants of the Keynesian model with
which we experimented performed worse than the equivalent RE—Fl model.

Columns 5, 6, and 7 report estimates of some dynamic factor models that
exclude hours of work from both the income process and consumption function.
Although the hours decision within the RE—Fl framework is viewed as exogenous,

it is interesting to explore the possibility that the endogeneity of hours is

adversely affecting the analysis. In column 5 we impose the restriction that

Uyt and u1 do not affect LC*. A comparison of the

lag innovations of

estimates of

and cyO with the coefficients of the income model

corresponding to column 5 indicates that the estimate of 8cwO' the effect of

wage innovations on consumption, is still too large relative to the estimate

of cyO' the effect of ut on consumption, when viewed within the RE—PI
model. The effect of

on consumption is not significantly different from

0. The model is not rejected against the four variable statlonarity model at
the .10 significance level.

In column 7 we estimate the restricted RE—PI model. The

pass. The estimate of the discount factor p is 1.66 with a standard error of
.598.

The Keynesian model in column (7) is rejected against the stationary

model at the .05 level.

Dynamic Factor Models with Exogenous Income using Logs.
Column 8 of Table 5 presents the unrestricted log linear consumption
equation. In contrast to the results for levels, none of the coefficients on
lagged income determinants are significantly different from 0.

Since the relationship between the consumption change and innovations in

the determinants of the log of income is very complicated, we could only
impose the zero restrictions implied by the RE—PI model on the loglinear
model.

Column 9 of Table 5 reports results for the loglinear consumption

equation with coefficients on lagged income determinants set to 0.

qualitative results largely follow those found in the levels.

The
This

consumption equation and the associated income equations easily passes tests

against the stationarity model and against the model with the unrestricted
consumption equation. Unemployment and hours of work innovations have small,
statistically insignificant, effects on consumption. Wages again have a more
persistent effect on income than unemployment. However, when compared to the

parameters of the income equation, 8cwO seems large relative to 8cyO'
Inconsistency of timing of the variables or a substitution effect of the wage
on consumption are among possible explanations for this.

Column 10 in Table 5 presents estimates for the five variables loglinear

model with the Keynesian consumption function.

The Keynesian model is

overwhelmingly rejected, although the estimates of the income process and the

other processes do not differ much from those of the P1 models. However, it
should be mentioned that the estimates do not satisfy the standard convergence
criterion. 14

The results for this section may be summarized as follows. First, many

of the coefficients of the consumption and income model are imprecisely
estimated, leading to imprecise estimates of the discount factor.

Second,

— 37 —

when the data are in levels, we find evidence that consumption is affected by
lagged determinants of income. We do not find evidence of this when the data

are in logs.

Third, the response of consumption to

seems large and the

response to u seems small relative to the long run effects of these
variables on consumption. Fourth, the Keynesian model is rejected.

As for the family income process, the estimates are disappointing in
terms of the fraction of the variance explained by the wage, unemployment and

hours factors relative to the variance explained by the income factor
The regression analysis in Table 4 suggests that this finding reflects basic
characteristics of our data. Inconsistency in the timing and time aggregation

of some of the variables may also play a role. We turn to this issue below.

A second explanation is that our assumptions about the properties of the
measurement errors are invalid, leading to a misspecified income equation.

Weighted Least Squares
We report a set of weighted least squares (WLS) estimates of the
stationary models, the RE—PI and Keynesian models, in the Appendix (Table Ala,

Mb, A2, A3).

The reported standard errors for the levels results are

calculated as if WLS is efficient. (We experienced computational problems in

correcting the standard errors when the data are in levels. We will provide

them in a later draft. We also will also report goodness of fit statistics
for the factor models at that time.)

is

still

The parameter estimates for all models, especially

for data in the levels, are larger in absolute values than those obtained with

OMD. We are somewhat puzzled by this phenomena. The standard errors of the
estimates are also larger as expected because WLS is inefficient relative to
OMD.

The deterioration in precision of the level estimates is particularly
-

troubling.

The

WLS estimates of the factor models in Table A2 and A3 are

qualitatively similar to those obtained by OMD. Measurement error explains a
larger portion of the variance of the change in measured work hours.

It is

still insignificant or has the wrong sign for measured wages. The estimates
of P are still very imprecise. The main difference between Tables A2 and A3
and the OMD Tables 3 and 5 is that the absolute values of the factor loadings
are typically larger when WLS is used.

Unbalanced Data

In trying to get more precision for our estimation procedures, we
estimated the model on two larger samples.

Both larger samples were

unbalanced (i.e. each sample covariance was not necessarily calculated with

— 39 —

the same number of observations). In one sample, using the same years 1976—
1981, we also include individuals who did not have complete data on all
variables for all the years.

After this addition, between 1699 to 2877

observations are available to calculate each sample covariance.

The point

estimates as well as their standard errors obtained with this larger sample,

using the OMD estimator, are larger than before.'6 We again could not pin
down an estimate of p. The additional data does not improve the precision of

our estimates because the sample covariances for those individuals with
missing data are substantially larger than those of individuals with complete

data. That is, the two sets of individuals faced different income processes.
For example, for data in logs, the sample variances of income, wages and hours

of work are about 3 times larger than for the balanced sample. The variance

of unemployment was 10 times larger. This is not surprising given that the
wage measure is a available in a given year only for persons who are employed

or on temporary layoff at the time of the survey. As a result, the balanced
sample is weighted toward individuals with relatively stable employment. We
experimented with estimating the income process for each group of individuals
separately while constraining the estimates of c and p to be the same for the

two groups. The results are inconclusive.

In the second sample, we also included data from before 1976 back to
1968. We extended the sample temporally in an attempt to improve precision.

This led to an increase in the number of second moments used in estimation

from 212 to 583. We used the WLS estimator with this sample because it
became computationally intractable to invert the full empirical fourth moment
matrix.

The estimates of the covariances of the stationary model were

substantially larger than those obtained for the balanced sample.

The

parameters of the factor models also increased in absolute value, although

— 40 —

the relative values are basically similar to those reported.'8 The variances
of the innovations again appear to be higher for those individuals who are
missing data for some years, as one would expect. Our estimates of

and P

were not very precise, as an increase in the mean square error of the
stationary model and the various factor models approximately offset the
increase in the sample size.

5.4: Time Aggregation and Nonsynchronous Measurements: Estimates of the
Quarterly Dynamic

Factor

Models

Table 6 presents estimates of the quarterly dynamic factor model. (See
equation (3.4)). Columns Ia and lb report estimates and standard errors when

the data are In levels and annual hours are excluded from the analysis. In

this model the response of consumption to the current wage, income, and
unemployment innovations are unrestricted, while the model in column 2a and 2b

parameterizes these responses in terms of the marginal propensity to consume

out of wealth and the quarterly discount factor Pq

In column 3a and b we

report estimates and standard errors of the quarterly dynamic factor model

when the data are in logs.

We ignore the problem that the log of annual

income is not equal to the sum of the logs of quarterly income.

The parameters of the income, wage and unemployment equations (the aki)

are the parameters of the polynomial distributed lag specifications in
equation (3.4).

In Figure 1 we plot the time pattern of the response of

income Y* (as opposed to iY*t), the wage W*, and unemployment Z* to a one

In Figure 2 we report the corresponding Information for the

— 41

We

—

focus our discussion on the results for the log models. Y*, initially

increases by .028 in response to a wage innovation of .058.

It rises above

this level in the next period, declines almost to 0, before rising again. The
long run response is .028, so most of the wage effect is permanent, while the
long run effect of a wage innovation on the wage level is about .038.

Since

the mean of labor earnings is equal to about two thirds of the mean of family

income, the size of the response of income to the wage factor is basically
sensible.

These results are a substantial improvement over the results

obtained using the annual model. However, the shape of the response is not
entirely plausible and may be an artifact of the quadratic polynomial imposed

on the moving average coefficients used in estimation. The pattern and size
of the response of income to unemployment seems sensible.

Wages and unemployment explain 22.8% and 7.5% of the true variance in the

quarterly change in income, while the income factor explains 69.6 %.

Wages

and unemployment explain 15.3% and 1.8% of the variance of change in the

annual average of income, while the income factor explains 83.2%.

The

importance of measurement error in the annual average falls to 46.7%.

When

the data are in levels rather than logs, the wage, unemployment, and income
factors explain 10.6%, 3.7%, and 86.7% of the true variance in the change in
the annual average of family income. Measurement error accounts for 49.5% of

The increase in the explanatory power of the wage in the

quarterly models relative to the annual models suggests that treatment of
timing is useful.

In column 2a, the estimate of the quarterly discount factor Pq is .974.

This implies an annual discount factor of about .9.

This point estimate is

favorable to the RE—PI model but is subject to a large standard error.

— 42 —

We

now turn to the consumption coeficients based on the loglinear

specification in column 3a.

The cwO is .0118 and cyO is .0114, which

implies that the consumption response to a one standard deviation wage
innovation and a one standard deviation income innovation are approximately
equal.

The response of consumption to the wage innovation seems large

relative to the response to the income innovation. The long run response of
income to the wage innovation (.028) is only 4/7th's as large as the response

of income to the income innovation (.048).

On the other hand, the small

response of consumption to unemployment is consistent with the fact that the

income parameters imply the long run response of income to a one standard
deviation innovation in unemployment is only .001.

Table 7 presents a set of estimates of the quarterly models with annual
hours included.

Col. 1 presents the levels results for the model with a

consumption equation in which the responses to the current wage, income,
hours, and unemployment innovations are unrestricted. Col. 2 presents the RE—

PT model. Col. 3 presents the unrestricted log results. The time patterns of

responses of various variables to one standard deviation innovations in the
various factors implied by the estimates in Col. 1 and Col. 3 are presented in
Figures 3 and 4 respectively.

The results in Figures 3 and 4 are qualitatively similar to that in
Figures 1 and 2.

Concentrating on the log results (Figure 4), in the long

run, hours rise by about 1% in response to a one standard deviation innovation

in the hours factor.
1%.

The long run impact on income is slightly more than

The income response seems a little large although basically sensible.

The long run response of hours to unemployment innovations is basically zero,

consistent with that of income. Measurement error explains about 25% of the

variance in the change in measured hours of work.

Measurement error now

— 43 —

explains

53% of the variance of the change in measured income. Wages, hours

of work, unemployment and income innovations explain 12%, 5%, 4%, and 79% of

the variance of the change in true family income respectively.

It is

surprising that adding hours of work reduces the variance explained by wages

and unemployment relative to that explained by the income factor. When the
data are in levels, wages, hours of work, unemployment and income innovations

explain 6%, 3%, 2% and 89% of the variance of the change in true income.
Measurement error accounts for 21% of the variance of the change in measured
income. Again, adding hours of work seems to add to the explanatory power of
the income factor.

Turning to the RE—PI model in Col. 2, Pq is estimated as 1.03 with a
standard error of .077.

The estimate of

is .03 with a standard error of

.01. So the restricted estimates are basically consistent with that obtained
in the model which excludes hours of work.

In summary, accounting for non—syncronization in the data reduces the
explanatory power of measurement error in measured income.

The explanatory

power of the income factor is also reduced in favor of the wage factor in
explaining the variance of the change in true income. Measurement error now
explains a substantial portion of the variance in the change in work hours,
consistent with the evidence in the literature. Finally, the point estimates
of the discount rate are more reasonable.

5.5: The Hall and Mishkin Model

Given our difficulties in getting a precise estimate of p and also for

purposes of comparison, we present estimates of the Hall and Mishkin model
using the optimal minimum distance estimator.

As argued earlier, we do not

use maximimum likelihood because the data are not normally distributed. We

— 44 —

estimate the model with two sets of data. The first data set are simply the
consumption and income moments from our balanced sample. The second data set

consists of the consumption and income moments for individuals that have
complete consumption and income data. An individual with incomplete wage data

will not be in the first data set but will be in the second. The larger data

set has over twice the number of observations, 2324.

Since we correct for

heteroscedasticity and we also use different measurement units than Hall and

Mishkin use, our estimated variances are not quantitatively comparable to
thei rs.

Col. 1 of Table 8 reproduces the Hall and Mishkin results from their
Table 1 (notation in Table 8 is theirs).

Their estimated , together with

their estimates of the moving average parameters of transitory income imply an

infinite horizon discount factor p of .77. Col. 2 presents our OMD estimates
of their model using the first data set. The p—value for rejecting the model

against the non—stationary alternative is .013. This p—value is much larger
than that obtained by any of our models.

It says that the consumption and

income moments alone may be close to stationarity. The p—value for the model

against the stationary model is .01.

The t—statistics associated with the

point estimates are much smaller than that in col. 1. The point estimate of p
seems reasonable.

data set.

Col. 3 presents the results using the second and larger

The p—values against the non—stationary model and the stationary

model are .08 and .10 respectively. Again the t—statistics are smaller than
those in Col.1. However the point estimate for p this time is .17. Given the

large standard error, a reasonable p cannot be rejected. The differences in

point estimates across Col. 1, 2 and 3 do suggest that imprecision in the
estimation of p also plagues the Hall and Mishkin model.

We note that the

qualitative features of our estimates do not differ much from theirs,
especially in view of our more conservative standard errors.

Unfortunately

— 45 —

the point estimates of p are quite sensitive to small differences in the point
estimates of the income process.

Given our standard errors, these small

differences are to be expected when we switch samples. The relatively smaller

standard errors that they obtained are due to their assumption of normality
and their subsequent choice of the maximum likelihood estimator.

6. A DYNAMIC FACTOR MODEL OF CONSuMPTION AND lABOR SUPPLY
The "permanent income" specification of the lifecycle hypothesis embodied

in equation (2.1) has been used in many studies and is very convenient for
empirical work. But it imposes many restrictions upon behavior that are not
essential to the basic idea of the lifecycle model of consumer behavior and

limit the empirical questions which it may be used to ask.

First, the

relationship between consumption and lifetime resources does not reduce to the

simple permanent income formulation except in a very special case, even if
preferences are additively separable in consumption and leisure within and
across time periods.

Second, there is no natural way to integrate labor

supply into the RE—PI analysis.

Third, if preferences are not additively

separable within the period, then both anticipated and unanticipated changes

in the wage rate will have pure substitution effects on consumption
expenditures.

It would be desirable to separate out the intertemporal

substitution and within period substitution effects of the wage rate on
consumption and labor supply from the "income effect" of this variable.

The lifecycle model of consumption and labor supply may explain some of

our earlier empirical results.

The weak evidence, for data in the levels,

against the exogeneity of wages and hours can be reconciled with endogenous
labor supply. The relatively large response of consumption to the wage factor

may be explained by substitution of consumption and leisure in a lifecycle
model (e.g. Ghez and Becker (1975)).

The "income" effects on consumption and labor supply of shocks to budget

parameters such as the wage rate and shocks to preferences arise through the
effects of these shocks on At..

The expected value of the marginal utility of

income, At, is implicitly defined by the parameters of the utility function,

current and the individual's wealth level and expectations about the

— 48 —

distribution

of current and future values of wages, interest rates, prices,

and the preference shifters.

Since an analytical solution for

does not

exist in the case of uncertainty and time varying preferences, there is little

hope of obtaining an analytical solution for the relationship between the
innovation

and innovations in the exogenous factors entering the

lifetime budget constraint. As a basis for empirical work, we simply specify

as an unrestricted linear function of unanticipated changes in exogenous
(with respect to preferences) factors affecting income (such as wage rates)
and unanticipated changes in preferences.

Given the "exogenous" equations (1.ld,

1.le), that is wages and

unemployment, let n depend upon the innovations in these variables plus the

error component u which captures the effects of factors whic" have been

RESULTS FOR THE LIFECYCLE CONSUMPTION—LABOR SUPPLY MODEL

presents estimates of the

dynamic factor model that

imposes the 0 restrictions implied by (6.6, 6.7 and 6.8) on the general

model (1.1).

The estimates of measurement

error in wages and hours of work are imprecise. Variation in wage, hours of
work, and unemployment innovations explain about 2/3 of the variation of yfl*

after correcting for measurement error and about 1/6th of the total variance
in 1yfl*

The shortfall seems large even though labor earnings may contain

bonuses, overtime wages or wages on second jobs, and these are not be captured

by our wage and hours variables. The regressions for labor earnings in Table
4 indicate that the marginal contribution to R2 of current and lagged wages,

hours and unemployment is .237.

The variable C* responds only to current

innovations in the wage and earnings which suggests that Bcn=Bnc=O•
Unemployment is more transitory than wages in affecting the earnings
process. An interesting finding is that innovations due to the income factor
affect hours of work.

In Column 2 we report estimates of a restricted labor supply model. Bcn

8nc' and y are restricted to be zero. Measurement error in nonlabor income
is absorbed in u. We do not impose restrictions on the earnings process to

guard against misspecification of the earnings equation (in view of the
results in Column 1 and the results for family income in Section 4)-

The

strategy here is to use the unrestricted earnings process as an additional

indicator to aid identification of the factor loadings in the other
equations.

The estimate of the intertemporal labor supply elasticity Bn is

—.117 with a standard error of .131. From equations (6.7) and (l.ld), we see

that E can be identified from Cov(Nt,iWt_2)/Cov(Wt,Wt_2). From the point
estimates in Table ib, one can see that the sign of the estimate of

is

partially due to the insignificant and small negative estimate of Cov(Nt,

Wt_2).

The negative estimate has the wrong sign but is not significantly

— 52 —

different

from 0 or from the small positive values found in most previous

micro data studies.

The estimate of B is —.295 with a standard error of

.119. The negative estimate is predicted by the theory. The estimate of
the effect of wage innovations on the marginal utility of wealth which should

be negative, is —.0841 with a standard error of .0279. The estimate of

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Since we have summarized our main empirical findings in the introduction
and Sections 5 and 7. we close the paper with a research agenda. First, since

more precision in our estimates would be helpful, we are 4n the midst of
analyzing an expanded balanced sample for the years 1976—1983.

Second, we are estimating a version of the lifecycle model based on a
dynamic quarterly model.

Third, within the context of the permanent income model we are taking a
number of approaches to investigate the possibility that the income factor ut

in our model is contaminated by misspecification. At several points in the
paper we have noted that the response of consumption to the income factor u
sern1s small relative to the response of consumption to the wage. This is true

in the quarterly dynamic factor models as well as the models which ignore
problems of timing and nonsyncronization. The income factor is distinguished
from income measurement error only by the fact that it is not restricted to be

a white noise process and that it is correlated with consumption. All factors

that affect income, other than wages, unemployment and work hours, are
summarized by uyt.

It is unlikely that the consumption response to these

factors is appropriately modelled as if consumption was responding to a single

factor that followed the u process.

Indeed, a motivation for our paper is

the view that it is important to use more than one indicator of the factors
which drive family income if one is to sort out the true income process from

— 54 —

measurement error.

One approach which we have already explored is to attempt

to estimate the marginal propensity to consume and the discount rate from the

wage, unemployment, and hours factors only

Tinfortunately, the results are

very imprecise. A second approach we hope to explore is to add wife's work
hours to the model as an additional indicator, although some researchers who
are can to accept husband's unemployment and even hours of work as exogenous

with respect to consumption may balk at using wife's hours. What is really
needed is a data set which contains reliable information on additional factors

which affect income.

More accurate and complete information on consumption

expenditures would also be very helpful.

model" to refer to models in which labor income is exogenous and current
wealth plus the expected discounted value of current and future income is a
sufficient statistic for the effect of lifetime resources on consumption.

2. The pure intertemporal substitution responses to wages, prices, and
interest rates (with the marginal of utility of income held constant) can and
have been estimated without a model of wage, price and interest rate behavior.

(See for example, Heckman and MaCurdy (1980), MaCurdy (1981), Hansen and
Singleton (1983) and Browning et al (1985), and Altonji (1986)). Furthermore,

following Hall (1978), many studies have tested versions of the permanent
income and lifecycle models by examining whether past information about wages,
interest rates and other budget constraint determinants is related to changes
in consumption. These stu.4ies, surveyed in Hayashi (1985a). do not require a
detailed model of the income process either. See King (1985), Deaton (1985),

Mayer (1972), and Hayashi (1985a) for discussions and references to the
permanent income hypothesis. See Altonji (1986), Blundell (1986), Browning et
al (1984), Ghez and Becker (1975), Heckman (1974), Heckman and MaCurdy (1980),
King (1985), Killingsworth (1983), MaCurdy (1981,1983), Mankiw etal. (1985),
for detailed discussions and references to the literature on lifecycle models.

3. Duncan and Hill (1984) have provided some direct evidence on the
importance of measurement error by comparing the responses of employees of a

single large firm with the records of the employer.

They find that

measurement error accounts for 16.8 percent of the variance in the earnings
level. Under reasonable assumptions, these would translate into a much larger
percentage of the variance in the first difference of earnings. Measurement
error in nonlabor income is likely to be an even more serious problem. Mellow
and Sider( 1984) use matched employer/employee responses to show the existence
of considerable measurement error in the survey data. Altonji (1986) provides
evidence of substantial measurement error in the first difference of the log
of earnings divided by hours and in hours of work. For the same data, Altonji
and Siow (1986) found that the lifecycle model may be wrongly rejected if

measurement error in the income variable is ignored, and found that
ordinary least squares estimate of the regression coefficient relating
change in consumption to the change in income is only one third of
estimate obtained using an instrumental variables estimator to account

the
the
the
for

measurement error. In his survey, Hayashi (1985q) concludes that measurement
error is a major issue in micro panel studies of consumption and liquidity
constraints.

4. Attention to reporting error problems in work on the consumption
function is not new. For example, the interesting study by Bhalla(1979) makes
use of an Indian panel data containing independent measures of consumption,
savings, and income to study consumption behavior. However, Bhalla's analysis
is not conducted in a rational expectations framework and di fers in many ways
from the work presented here.

5. Holbrook and Stafford (1971) analyzed the link between the level of

consumption and various components of family income using one year of
consumption data and 3 years of income data for a cross section of families.

— 56

They assume that the components of income each consist a fixed trend and a
transitory element. The transitory elements may be correlated across income
components and may be autocorrelater! for up to one period. Although Holbrook
and Stafford do not work within a rational expectations framework, their
analysis shows that consumption is less responsive to the elements of family
income which are most transitory, and is an important precursor to the Hall
Mishkin study and the present project. An early study by Mincer (1960) uses
wage changes as an indicator of permanent income changes and hours changes as
an indicator of transitory income changes.

6. See Lillard and Weiss (1979), Hause (1980), Kearl (1985), MaCurdy
(1982 a and b), Abowd and Card (1985 and 1986) and Chowdhury and Nickell
(1985).

7. Hall and Mishin (1982) found that the change in consumption responds
to the lagged change in income using the PSID, and this result is frequently
cited as evidence against a simple rational expectations permanent income
model.
The bulk of the evidence from time series data is consistent with
their results
(See Deaton (1985)). However, our finding that this evidence
for the PSID is not robust is consistent with the results of our earlier paper
(Altonji and Siow (1986)). In that paper we obtain different evidence on the
effect of the lagged change in the log of income on the change in the log of
consumption with different samples, although the empirical magnitude of the
effect was small in all cases.
Zeldes (1985) findings on the relationship
between change in the log of consumption and the lagged value of the log of
income are also sensitive to the details of the specification and sample.
8. We also experimented with hours of illness, but it did not contribute
much to explaining the variables of interest.

9. While it may not be what they had in mind, the permanent income
quarterly model specified below aggregates up to the restrictions Hall and
Mishkin impose on the covariance annual data (see their page 472). Moreover,
it is consistent with their structural intepretation of their parameters.

These fourth

19. We have not explored models which relax intertemporal separability,

and our interpretation of the evidence is of course conditional on this
assumption.
See Hotz et al (1985), Eichenbaum et al (1984), and Blundell
(1986) for some initial steps in this direction.

20. As Ham (1986) and others have discussed, the presence of hours
constraints may bias the estimates of the labor supply parameters,
particularly if u is correlated with the other factors in the model.

Problems may also atse if, as in the Lucas and Rapping model of unemployment,
hours of unemployment are intrinsically related to labor supply decisions and
vazy with the wage rate. We are ignoring these considerations. Note that we
cannot
reject
the hypothesis that covariances between the wage and
unemployment are 0.
The papers by Ashenfelter (1980) Browning et al (1985))

suggest that the form of the consumption, hours, and marginal utility of
income equations are

affected

by constraints on labor supply.

21. As Chamberlain (1984) pointed out and Hayashi (1985b) observed in a
similar context, the rational expectations hypothesis does not imply that the
forecast error T1 is uncorrelated with past information when the distribution
is taken across households rather than over time for a given household. If
the effect of an aggregrate disturbance on the
of Income is
marinal
systematically related to determinants of Ew
and
t—i'
t—1'
then these determinants will be correlated with
in a short panel.
A similar problem would arise in Hall and Mishkin's analysis or in the work
with the RE—PI model discussed above. However, we doubt if this is a serious
problem here, since most of the variation in the change in the wage, hours of

utility

unemployment, hours lost due to illness and other key elements of w

and Q
occurs over time for a given household rather than
cross—sectional, and we follow Hall and Mishkin's lead and remove the main
effects of aggregate shocks through the use of time dummies.
22. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to attempL to estimate the

contribution of

various factors to the variance in the innovation of
of income.
Using aggregate time series data, Attfield
provide estimates of the covariance of innovation of

impose the assumption of rational expectations.

bThe x2 statistic and degrees of freedom are for a test of the
consumption equation and the associated
income model against the covariance stationary model.
The cross covariances between hours and wages and
unemployment and wages are not used in estimation. 2I..moments are used to estimate columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9,
and 10. /41 sample moments are used to estimate columns 6, 7, 11, and 12, which exclude annual hours.

acol 1 is the unrestricted levels consumption model. It is jointly estimated with the levels income model
in Table 3. Col. 2 has no lagged factors. Col. 3 is the RE—PI model. Col. 4 is the Keynesian model. Col.
