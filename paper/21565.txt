The Price of Responsibility: The Impact of Health Reform on Non-Poor Uninsureds

ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the change in net (of subsidy) financial burden (“the price of responsibility”)
and in welfare that would be experienced by a large nationally representative sample of the “non-poor”
uninsured if they were to purchase Silver or Bronze plans on the ACA exchanges. The sample is the
set of full-year uninsured persons represented in the Current Population Survey for the pre-ACA period
with incomes above 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The estimated change in financial burden
compares out-of-pocket payments by income stratum in the pre-ACA period with the sum of premiums
(net of subsidy) and expected cost sharing (net of subsidy) for benchmark Silver and Bronze plans,
under various assumptions about the extent of increased spending associated with obtaining coverage.
In addition to changes in the financial burden, our welfare estimates incorporate the value of additional
care consumed and the change in risk premiums for changes in exposure to out-of-pocket payments
associated with coverage, under various assumptions about risk aversion. We find that the average
financial burden will increase for all income levels once insured. Subsidy-eligible persons with incomes
below 250 percent of the poverty threshold likely experience welfare improvements that offset the
higher financial burden, depending on assumptions about risk aversion and the value of additional
consumption of medical care. However, even under the most optimistic assumptions, close to half
of the formerly uninsured (especially those with higher incomes) experience both higher financial
burden and lower estimated welfare; indicating a positive “price of responsibility” for complying with
the individual mandate. The percentage of the sample with estimated welfare increases is close to
matching observed take-up rates by the previously uninsured in the exchanges.

I. INTRODUCTION
A major objective of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to reduce financial barriers to
insurance, and thus to change the patterns of care and the total amount of care consumed. The
ideal outcome envisioned by designers of the law was near-universal coverage, with virtually all
Americans covered by health insurance. Such an outcome would presumably please the bulk of
the population that was and is insured and that previously paid for charity and bad debt care used
by the uninsured. But what would its effect be on the financial and economic welfare of those
formerly uninsured people? That is the question this paper addresses.
The law includes three main provisions intended to reduce the number of uninsured with
incomes above the Medicaid eligibility threshold of 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level
(FPL): (1) an individual mandate that will impose a fine if individuals remain uninsured (subject
to an exception if coverage is “unaffordable”); (2) insurance premium subsidies to persons with
incomes below 400 percent of FPL who obtain individual insurance through the exchanges and
insurance cost sharing subsidies to persons with incomes up to 250 percent of FPL who obtain
selected coverage through the exchanges; and (3) regulation of the relative premiums different
people pay for individual insurance by prohibiting underwriting and pricing based on health risk
and restricting premium variation in relation to age.
There is little evidence on how reform might have affected the financial and economic
well-being of these “non-poor” potential enrollees (i.e., those with incomes above 138 percent of
FPL). The data does indicate that many previously uninsured individuals who were not poor
have obtained coverage through the exchanges during the first two enrollment years. Enrollment
data for 2015 indicate that 83 percent of exchange enrollees had incomes less than 250 percent of
FPL (ASPE 2015) and that estimated take up rates for exchange coverage by the previously

2

uninsured decline sharply with increases in income (Avalere 2015).1 This paper estimates the
potential financial and welfare consequences of moving this “non-poor” uninsured population,
defined as those with incomes above the Medicaid limit, from no coverage to coverage.2
In addition to the ACA’s obvious concern for the poor uninsured, there has been
considerable policy interest in the larger population of non-poor uninsured for several reasons.
Some argue that they act “irresponsibly” in not buying insurance and then failing to pay the full
cost of care they receive, relying instead on charity care and bad debt forgiveness. Their
irresponsibility is assumed to harm the insured members of the community both because the
insured finance some of the care used by the uninsured and because they experience distress in
observing the uninsured foregoing needed care due to financial barriers. Others are concerned
that, even when the non-poor uninsured are willing to pay the full cost of care out of pocket, they
may forgo care of high benefit to themselves and of concern to the rest of the community.
Indeed, the provision in the ACA imposing a financial penalty on those who fail to obtain
qualified coverage is called the “individual shared responsibility provision.”
Reducing the extent and consequences of such “irresponsible” behavior was a major
motivation for including the individual mandate in the ACA and other health reform proposals.
One key question therefore is the law’s effect on the average cost of medical care and insurance
now shifted to the formerly uninsured who purchase coverage in response to the law. Another
key issue is the extent to which the law reduced the financial risk (variability) in the cost of care
for the formerly uninsured. But perhaps the most important key question is the extent to which
this population will move from uninsured to insured, and the gains and losses they would

known.

experience from doing so. We therefore estimate the average financial impact of the law and
other dimensions of welfare change resulting from the value of greater protection against the risk
of high out-of-pocket cost and greater use of care.
Our empirical approach begins with a comparison of the payments (all out of pocket)
made for care by the uninsured before the ACA to expected benchmark premiums and out-ofpocket payments under ACA Silver and Bronze insurance plans.3 This comparison estimates the
financial effects of coverage for the uninsured who obtain and pay for such coverage. We
further estimate the welfare changes from increased coverage by developing estimates of any
changes in “risk premiums,” the values of increased risk protection. We also estimate the value
to the formerly uninsured of any additional care they receive associated with insurance coverage
under various assumptions concerning potential increases in the demand for care (whether due to
moral hazard or income effects), and valuation of that care. Our estimates account for both
premium subsidies and cost sharing subsidies. We focus on the lowest-cost Bronze plan and the
second-lowest Silver plan as benchmark post-ACA choices.4
Finally, we use the resulting estimation of welfare gains and losses (in a way different
from the elasticity-based simulation models used to predict post-ACA takeup) to describe the
likely pattern of enrollment in or rejections of the new regulated, subsidized, and penalized
options available to consumers after the ACA. Our results should be interpreted as predictions of
the financial and welfare implications if nearly all of the uninsured were to purchase these types

3

The ACA permits five categories of plans to be sold in the individual health insurance market with benchmark
actuarial values (percentage of eligible medical costs reimbursed by the plan, in parentheses): Bronze (60 percent),
Silver (70 percent), Gold (80 percent), Platinum (90 percent), and catastrophic plans for young adults (< 60 percent).
As noted, premium subsidies are available for plans purchased through the ACA exchanges for persons with
incomes up to 400 percent of FPL. Cost sharing subsidies are available to purchases of Silver plans with incomes up
to 250 percent of FPL.

Premium subsidy amounts are based on the second lowest cost Silver plan offered in an enrollee’s geographic

of coverage as the law intended. We do not estimate any welfare effects for the rest of the
community from redistribution of the cost of care or from values they might attach to improved
health or reduced financial risk for the formerly non-poor uninsured.
We find that, since the non-poor uninsured previously paid a relatively small share of
their medical spending before the ACA and had a low level of total spending and use of care,
most of them will experience both high premiums (net of subsidies) and (perhaps surprisingly)
high average or expected out-of-pocket payments if they were to buy ACA coverage. At lower
income levels, subsidies for premiums and cost sharing will limit the financial costs and
incentivize purchase. At all income levels, the premiums will still represent positive payments
for those who (by definition) previously paid nothing for insurance, while the effect of coverage
in reducing out-of-pocket payments tends to be modest. At higher income levels, small or zero
subsidies and currently modest penalties will not be enough to affect the large welfare losses that
the middle class uninsured would experience were they to buy coverage. The minority of high
risks among the middle class uninsured may gain, but most uninsured will lose and, according to
our estimates, will prefer to remain uninsured at the current penalty levels for violating the
individual mandate.
So in terms of welfare, our results suggest that many persons with low incomes may fare
better after the ACA, but those formerly uninsured at higher incomes not in poor health
consistently are worse off from purchasing coverage regardless of the assumptions made
regarding spending increases and risk aversion. For those at low income levels, the welfare
benefits from Silver coverage in terms of less variable out-of-pocket payments and from
increased use of care may outweigh financial costs, leading to welfare improvements even if
financial burden increases. Given that insurance reduces the variability of out-of-pocket

5

payments, the specific magnitudes of the welfare estimates, and the extent to which lower
income groups benefit, depend in part on the assumed level of risk aversion and in part on the
assumed extent of welfare cost due to moral hazard. We consider a “best-case” scenario in terms
of the benefits furnished by insurance that assumes high risk aversion and values additional care
equal to its cost (effectively assuming zero welfare cost of moral hazard). Under that scenario,
we estimate meaningful welfare gains for the lowest-income group but still estimate sizable
average welfare losses for those above 250 percent of FPL, significantly reducing incentives for
obtaining coverage to comply with the law.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes the basic empirical framework and
data. Section III presents the specific approach to measuring the financial and economic welfare
impacts of ACA coverage on the uninsured. Section IV presents results, and Section V
concludes.

II. EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK AND DATA
We use nationwide data from the CPS to measure the nationwide pre-ACA distribution of
uninsured persons by age, sex, income, and state. The CPS provides the largest available sample
of the uninsured at the state level. Information on the distribution of the uninsured by state is
critical for our analysis because ACA insurance premiums vary by state. We use the nationwide
MEPS to measure total health expenditures for this population and to estimate out-of-pocket
payments in both the pre- and post-ACA periods. The MEPS contains measures of health care
utilization and spending both by the patient and by other sources using the most detailed
collection methods among nationwide surveys measuring health expenditure (Caswell and

6

O’Hara 2010), and it is the most frequently used data on total spending and out-of-pocket
spending for the uninsured.
Our empirical model then compares the expected value of out-of-pocket payments for the
population in the CPS sample of uninsureds with estimates of the sum of the premium and
expected out-of-pocket payments for benchmark insurance plans for that population post ACA.
That is, the measure of Financial Impact (FI) is defined as:
FI = E(OOPU) – (Prem + E(OOPI)
where E(OOPU) is the expected out-of-pocket payment when uninsured, E(OOPI) is the expected
out-of-pocket payment under the benchmark insurance plan, and Prem is the premium for that
plan.
The CPS sample includes adults who are citizens or non-citizen legal immigrants. We
exclude observations who have any form of health insurance coverage (public or private), are
younger than age 25 or older than 64, or have incomes below 138 percent of the FPL. We also
limit the sample to single-person families to reduce possible errors in determining eligibility for
family insurance coverage or premium tax credits in the exchanges. We combined CPS data for
surveys from the years 2010 through 2012.
Premiums on all plans in each geographic rating area were collected from Healthcare.gov
for the states in the Federally-Facilitated Marketplaces (FFM) and from state-based exchanges in
State-based Marketplaces (SBM).5 Premiums can vary within states by rating area. The
premiums collected from the government’s website are for individuals aged 40. We estimate
premiums for other ages of CPS respondents using standard age curves from the Center for

III. CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL AND WELFARE IMPACTS
A. Premiums and Out-of-Pocket Payments
The measure of financial impact we use is the change in the sum of premiums and
expected out-of-pocket payments.7 This measure automatically adjusts for changes in coverage
by using estimates of changes in average or expected out-of-pocket payments. For example, a
formerly uninsured person who experiences a reduction in average out-of-pocket payment (after
any cost-sharing subsidies) will experience a financial gain if this reduction exceeds the increase
in net-of-subsidy premium paid. In the pre-ACA period this measure is obviously just the
expected out-of-pocket payment since no premiums are paid.
The measure of premiums is a weighted average of the benchmark insurance premium for
each age level and state, weighted by proportions in the CPS population. Within each of a set of
income strata (based on income relative to the poverty line), the out-of-pocket payments and
premiums are estimated separately for different age-gender subgroups, to reflect both potential
demographic effects on out-of-pocket payments and the effect of age on exchange premiums.
We then calculate the average difference pre- and post-ACA within each income stratum, using
the demographic proportions in the CPS sample as weights.

6

The age-curve data by state is available at: www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-InsuranceMarket-Reforms/state-rating.html#age (accessed September 3, 2015).
7
This measure is the “total expected price” (TEP) from our earlier work (Pauly, Harrington, and Leive 2015), except
that pre-ACA TEP for the uninsured only measures expected out-of-pocket payment. Changes in TEP represent the
first-order effects of insurance coverage as modeled in the literature on health plan choice (Abaluck and Gruber
2011; Handel 2013; Heiss, Leive, McFadden, and Winter 2013).

8

Estimated out-of-pocket payments in the pre-ACA period using pre-ACA MEPS data are
constructed from predictions from a GLM regression (with gamma family and log link) of outof-pocket payment against a third-order polynomial in age interacted with sex, variables
measuring income levels and ratio to the poverty line, census region of residence, MSA or nonMSA location, race, survey year, and self-reported health status diagnoses of chronic conditions.
As described in detail below, we construct different risk groups based on age, sex, health status,
and income and take the means from the out-of-pocket payment regression predictions by risk
group. Since the MEPS sample is smaller than the CPS, we pool years 2007 through 2012.
To construct the measure of expected out-of-pocket payment under a benchmark ACA
plan in the post-ACA period, we use data on total health care spending from the MEPS for each
demographic, health status, and income subgroup. We then match MEPS estimates to the
demographics of the CPS population within each income stratum. We impose the same
restrictions on income and age as we do in the CPS. We inflate both out-of-pocket payments and
total spending using the medical care component of the consumer price index from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. We do not use the restricted state-level MEPS because the small sample sizes
by state prevents us from estimating spending distributions by age, sex, health status, and
income. We instead use the same distributions of spending for all states and do not make any
adjustments because analysis with the CPS found that state of residence was an insignificant
predictor of pre-ACA out-of-pocket spending.8

8

The CPS contains data on out-of-pocket payments but not total health care spending. Our results are not sensitive
to using the CPS to estimate pre-ACA OOP instead of the MEPS. We use the MEPS for pre-ACA OOP because we
require its associated measure of total spending to estimate out-of-pocket payments post-ACA. In our previous
analysis of those insured in the individual market (Pauly, Harrington, and Leive 2015), we studied the sum of
insurance premiums and out-of-pocket payments in the pre-ACA period. Since the two quantities are tied together
through coverage generosity, we used the CPS for pre-ACA TEP since it contained both OOP and premiums for
large samples by state. Since our focus is now on the uninsured whose premiums were zero in the pre-ACA period,
we use the MEPS to estimate out-of-pocket payments both before and after the ACA for consistency.

9

Measuring premiums and estimating out-of-pocket payments post-ACA requires a
number of assumptions. For a given plan, ACA premiums vary by age, geographic region, and
smoking status. Net-of-subsidy premiums vary by income level and the second-lowest cost
Silver plan in a region. Our calculations are based on non-smoker premiums, which will
understate average increases in TEP for the previously uninsured to the extent that post-ACA
premiums for smokers are higher than for non-smokers. Enrollees with incomes up to 400
percent of the FPL are eligible for premium subsidies in the form of tax credits. The law
stipulates the maximum percentage of modified adjusted gross income that the enrollee is
required to pay for coverage according to their income, as shown in the Appendix. The tax
credit is calculated as the difference between this maximum amount and their second-lowest
Silver plan premium in the person’s geographic rating area. This credit can also be directly
applied to the premiums of other plans, such as less expensive Bronze plans. We calculate the
tax credit using adjusted gross income measured in the CPS.
To provide a range of estimates of the financial impacts under various plan choices, we
analyze premiums of the second-lowest premium Silver plan and the lowest premium Bronze
plan. The lowest premium Bronze plan corresponds to the cheapest option (ignoring catastrophic
plans for ages under 30). The second-lowest premium Silver plan is an important benchmark
because it determines the size of the tax credit, and cost sharing subsidies for persons with
income up to 250 percent of FPL are only available if a Silver plan is purchased. Evidence from
states participating in the Federally Facilitated Marketplace indicates that most consumers chose
the lowest or second-lowest cost Bronze and Silver plans (Burke, Misra, and Sheingold 2014).
We do not consider what plans the formerly uninsured actually chose in the exchanges, both

10

because that data is still fragmentary and, more importantly, is endogenous to the TEP measure
we seek.
For both the lowest premium Bronze and second-lowest premium Silver plans, we
construct a state-level premium average that is weighted by the uninsured population within each
county. The uninsured population is measured from the American Community Survey.9 Ideally,
we would match the premiums from each rating area to each of our CPS observations based on
zip code. However, the CPS data does not include geographic information necessary to match to
ACA rating areas. Instead, we match at the state-level, assigning the state’s average premium to
each CPS observation within that state.
To estimate expected out-of-pocket costs under the ACA, we need a distribution of
medical care spending for the person to which the benefit provisions of Bronze or Silver
coverage will be applied. After gaining insurance coverage, the distribution of spending use for
the formerly uninsured may shift upward. Indeed, a major rationale for reform was to increase
the consumption of care by low-income uninsured people. The new level of consumption may
not match that of previous voluntary insurance purchasers, even after controlling for
demographics, due to different preferences or tastes for medical care between former insurance
purchasers and non-purchasers. For example, it is reasonable to believe that voluntary insurance
purchasers facing market premiums at a given risk level likely have higher demands for care
(conditional on insurance coverage) than those who must be subsidized or compelled to buy
insurance. But because the ACA forbids most risk underwriting (except for location, age, and
smoking), the uninsured population may have higher average risk than the insured population
within each demographic cell even without moral hazard. On the other hand, if there was

9

The results are not sensitive to weighting by the total population rather than the uninsured population.

11

previously adverse selection because of imperfect risk rating, the average uninsured health risk
may be lower. And if the uninsured have low tastes for care, the risk of spending—which is
what matters—may actually be lower for an uninsured person with health problems than for a
healthy insured person.
We allow for variation in potential demand responses due to price, income effects, and
shifts in risk by estimating out-of-pocket spending using two different distributions of total
health spending from the MEPS. As a lower bound, we use the pre-ACA spending distribution
of the uninsured, which assumes no demand response (17,977 observations). At the other
extreme, we use the distribution of persons with full-year private insurance in either the
individual or group markets (42,903 observations). This group spends more than double that of
the uninsured, conditional on age, sex, and income.
In each scenario, we further split the distributions by sex, ages above and below 40, selfassessed health (fair or poor vs. good, very good, or excellent) and two income groups (above vs.
below 250 percent FPL) for a total of 16 age/sex/income cells. Sample size limitations preclude
forming distributions based on finer categories of age, income, and other factors. The choice of
16 age/sex/income cells balances the goal of predictive information about health expenditure
against adequate cell sizes.
Based on the CPS sample, a sizeable fraction of the uninsured eligible for exchanges
have incomes well in excess of the poverty line. The proportion of the uninsured eligible for
exchanges with incomes above 175 percent of the poverty line is 80 percent, and the proportion
with incomes above 250 percent of the poverty line is 48 percent.10

10

As noted in the introduction, take up of coverage in the exchanges has been negatively and strongly related to
income (Avalere 2015).

12

As described earlier, for each observation in the relevant MEPS subsample we calculate
the (counterfactual) out-of-pocket payment that would result from applying representative cost
sharing for Bronze and Silver plans to their observed spending. We assume Bronze plans have a
deductible of $3,000 and coinsurance of 40 percent and that Silver plans have a $1,500
deductible and 20 percent coinsurance. Both plans have an OOP limit of $6,350.11 Although
specific benefit design information exists for each plan, the spending data is measured at
aggregate levels not detailed enough in terms of service or timing to create valid counterfactual
estimates, as data on individual insurance claims would permit.
We incorporate cost sharing subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket payments for Silver
plans if the enrollee’s income level is below 250 percent of the FPL. These subsidies take the
form of reduced deductibles, coinsurance rates, and out-of-pocket maxima (see Appendix). For
each MEPS observation, we apply the cost sharing subsidies applicable to that level of income
when calculating out-of-pocket payments from total health spending. Very importantly, we also
assume that the formerly uninsured who obtain coverage receive no charity care or bad debt
adjustments to their cost sharing in the post-ACA period. The means of the simulated out-ofpocket payments for each of the demographic groups are then assigned to the corresponding CPS
observations that match that age/sex/health status/income cell, weighting by the demographics of
the CPS population within that particular cell.12

11

These parameters are consistent with those computed by various actuarial firms for Bronze and Silver plans
presented in Kaiser Family Foundation (2011) and meet the actuarial value regulations using the CCIIO calculator.
The deductibles are lower (and coinsurance higher) than reports on the deductibles most popular in plans actually
purchased.
12
We adjust the mean out-of-pocket payment calculated from the MEPS according to the demographics in the CPS
within cells to account for differences in the age and income distributions within cells between surveys. As an
extreme example, if the CPS cell including ages below 40 includes 99 respondents aged 25 and 1 respondent aged
35, while the corresponding MEPS cells includes 99 respondents aged 35 and 1 respondent aged 25, we want to
correct for this difference since spending is related to age.

13

B. Welfare Adjustments to Estimated Financial Impact
1. Risk aversion
Because the demand for insurance stems from risk aversion, it is important to consider
the value of financial protection furnished by insurance. Given variability in the incidence and
severity of illness, any person’s observed out-of-pocket payment will likely differ from its
expected value (or from the average out-of-pocket payment for a population with the same sociodemographic characteristics). We develop a measure of the variance of out-of-pocket spending
about its conditional mean before and after reform as a measure of financial protection, and value
any increased protection using Arrow-Pratt approximations of the risk premium assuming
constant absolute risk aversion.13
Specifically, we calculate the variance of the difference between actual OOP and
predicted OOP from a GLM regression controlling for age, sex, geographic region, income,
years of education, survey year, race, smoking status, and prior diagnoses of chronic conditions.
We include measures of prior health status because they may be associated with differences in
expected out-of-pocket payments both while uninsured and with incomplete coverage in Bronze
or Silver plans. The residuals from these regressions represent the unexplained portion of out-ofpocket costs that are uncertain from the consumer’s perspective. As a measure of risk, we
calculate the variances of the residuals under Bronze and Silver benefit designs described above
for each of the 16 demographic groups from our spending distributions. In calculating OOP for

13

Note that the distribution of out-of-pocket payment will be affected by moral hazard as well as by insurance
coverage provisions. Other things equal, greater moral hazard will attenuate the financial value of insurance
protection for persons whose insurance includes cost sharing by boosting both total care consumed and aggregate
cost sharing for that care. If moral hazard is sufficiently high, financial risk may increase under insurance with cost
sharing. For example, if lowering cost sharing from 50percent to 40 percent caused spending to increase from 100 to
130, out-of-pocket spending would increase from 50 to 52. Even with demand elasticity lower than unity, moral
hazard attenuates the risk protection from greater insurance coverage.

14

those with incomes below 250 percent FPL, we incorporate cost sharing subsidies as shown in
the Appendix.
The Arrow-Pratt risk premium approximation is 0.52, where  is the coefficient of
absolute risk aversion and 2 is the variance of unexplained OOP.14 The difference in variances
pre- and post-ACA multiplied by 0.5 thus yields the change in the risk premium, which will be
positive if the variance of OOP decreases once insured. We focus on results using a coefficient
of absolute risk aversion of 3 x 10-4 based on the insurance plan choice literature (Cohen and
Einav 2007; Handel 2013; Handel and Kolstad 2015).15 In robustness tests, we examine the
sensitivity of our results to other assumed levels of risk aversion.

2. Value of additional health care
The second welfare adjustment reflects the value of additional care encouraged by
insurance. We have already incorporated additional OOP from higher spending associated with
providing coverage to the formerly uninsured. If there are no other impediments, and ignoring
income effects, the value of this care to the insured must equal or exceed the price paid out-ofpocket, otherwise the care would not have been consumed (assuming informed consumers). But
its value must fall short of the total cost of the incremental care (otherwise the care would have
been consumed with no insurance), ignoring income effects. We assume that the value of the
marginal dollar’s worth of insured care to someone who obtains insurance with cost sharing c in
the post-ACA period is $c. But what was the marginal value of a dollar’s worth of care not

14

This formula for the Arrow-Pratt approximation assumes risk is additively separable from wealth. The
approximation is accurate only for small risks or special cases such as CARA utility with normally distributed risks.
15
At this level of risk aversion, a consumer with CARA utility U(x)  exp(x) / would be indifferent
between accepting or rejecting a bet that offered a 50-50 chance to win $1,000 or lose $768. As another example, a
consumer with CARA utility and this level of risk aversion who faces a 20 percent chance of suffering a $1,000 loss
would be willing to pay a risk premium of $225 to fully insure the prospective loss.

15

covered by insurance in the pre-ACA period? If there were no charity or bad debt care it would
be worth $1. Assuming a linear demand curve, the value of the additional care would then be
(0.5) (1 - c) times the increment in spending. We use this value in our empirical estimates.
What is the effect of charity or bad debt care that reduced the cost of care to uninsured
people below its price? We can use the MEPS data to calculate the ratio r of out-of-pocket
payments to estimated total cost of care for the uninsured. That ratio is less than one for all
income categories (though it is higher for higher income uninsured) because of charity care and
bad debt. If the uninsured were able to adjust quantities, taking r into account, the starting point
marginal value would be $r and the change in cost sharing would be (r - c)—so the value of
additional care would be lower than described in the previous paragraph. Since one of the
purposes of charity care for donors was presumably to increase access and use of care by the
uninsured to higher levels than they would have chosen facing the full price, we would expect
some increase. But it may be that there were some (more) strict limits on care for the uninsured.
This would be especially likely for bad debt, but could even characterize charity care if donors
were more interested in alleviating the financial burden on the uninsured than in expanding
volume. Hence we do not add a further downward adjustment to the value of care in our
empirical estimates, but note that they could represent an overvaluation of the benefits from
additional use from the direct consumer’s perspective.
Figure 1 illustrates. We assume away income effects in this example, so that the demand
curve for a representative uninsured person DU also reflects that persons’ marginal benefit from
care. The coinsurance rate after the person buys coverage is c, and the person is able to obtain
the quantity he or she would demand at that price QI. If in contrast the person were both
uninsured and had to pay the full price of care, the quantity would be QU. But if the person

16

received charity care that reduced the marginal price per dollar of care to r, he or she would
demand QR.
The two potential measures of the value of any additional care obtained by the formerly
uninsured person are: (1) the area under the demand curve from QR to QI; or (2) the area under
the demand curve from QU to QI. The latter amount would correspond to the limiting case in
which donors (or debt forgiveness) held the increase in use in the pre-reform case to zero.
In summary: to estimate the value of the additional care caused by the presence of
insurance coverage, we need to consider the effective marginal price before the ACA and the
effective marginal price after the ACA given the choice of some particular ACA “metallic” tier
of coverage. If the marginal price before the ACA were 100 percent of the cost or price, then the
value of increased use is 0.5(P – cP)DQ, where c is the post ACA coinsurance rate and DQ is the
increase in use associated with it. But if the effective coinsurance rate before reform was less
than unity (because of charity care), then the value may be as low as r, so the calculation would
be 0.5(rP – cP)DQ.
We provide one additional calculation corresponding to a “best-case” scenario in terms of
the benefit furnished by insurance. One might assume that, because of imperfect information
and other impediments, the additional care used had a higher value than implied by the previous
discussion. There are some estimates that the additional use of care for the formerly uninsured
might yield health benefits so large that it is cost effective (Miller, Vigdor, and Manning 2004).
In the “best-case” scenario, we assume that incremental care had value equal to its cost in
calculating welfare changes from insurance. We also use a higher level of risk aversion of 0.001
to calculate the risk reduction benefits from ACA coverage in this scenario.

IV. RESULTS
The CPS and MEPS data indicate that the uninsured spent relatively modest amounts outof-pocket, on average, prior to the ACA. The mean OOP for the MEPS data shown in Table 1 is
$409 (which is slightly higher than for the CPS). The data strongly suggest that the non-poor
uninsured received costly care for which they did not pay, even at relatively high income levels.
The difference between the “cost of care” the uninsured received (shown as total spending preACA) and what they paid (OOP pre-ACA) is usually attributed to charity care and bad debt. The
actuarial value of the implicit insurance that the uninsured received (at zero premiums), i.e., the
fraction of total care not paid by the uninsured varies little across income groups, and averages
about 75 percentmore generous than a Bronze plan and similar to that for a Silver plan.16
Gross and net premiums for Silver and Bronze plans are presented in the remaining
columns of Table 1. The gross premiums differ by income only due to differences in the age
distribution within each income stratum. Gross premiums on average are substantially higher
than pre-ACA expected out-of-pocket payments for all income strata. Even with premium tax
credits, Silver premiums are more than twice the level of expected pre-ACA OOP, even for those
between 138 and 175 percent of FPL who receive large premium subsidies. On average for the
full sample of formerly uninsureds, the net Silver premium of $2,458 is more than five times
larger than pre-ACA OOP. The minimum premium Bronze plan has an average annual net
premium of $1,541 across income groups. Applying the tax credit to lowest cost Bronze plans
allows those at lower incomes to purchase coverage at very low prices. Individuals between 138
and 175 percent FPL would pay an average of just over $21 per month ($261 annually) for the
minimum premium Bronze plan. But for all other income groups and for all other coverage

16

Specifically, the actuarial value is calculated as 1– r, where r is the ratio of total OOP summed across consumers
to total spending summed across consumers. We use both OOP and total spending from the MEPS for consistency.

18

options, the post-ACA premiums alone exceed the average out-of-pocket payment while
uninsured. So even if we assumed that post-ACA insurance eliminated out of pocket payments,
the average uninsured person will suffer a financial loss because he or she will pay more in
premiums than their expected payments when uninsured.
Table 2 presents estimated expected OOP in Bronze and Silver plans, again displaying
pre-ACA OOP while uninsured for comparison. For both metallic levels, we present estimates
for the two spending distributions used to simulate OOP in the post-ACA period: (1) original
uninsured spending (implying no moral hazard); and (2) spending for persons insured in the
individual market. For the uninsured with low incomes, estimated out-of-pocket spending is
moderately reduced in Silver plans due to cost sharing subsidies if the spending distribution
remains the same as without insurance, whereas the higher-income uninsured consistently have
higher out-of-pocket spending even after obtaining coverage. With Bronze coverage, average
OOP increases because cost-sharing subsidies are only available with Silver plans and the
implicit actuarial value (as a proportion of total spending) from bad debt and charity care while
uninsured was well above the 60 percent benchmark for Bronze coverage.
Table 3 shows that the sum of premiums and out-of-pocket payments (TEP) substantially
exceeds the amounts paid while uninsured, even at lowest income levels. For all of the reasons
just discussed, those receiving low or zero subsidies from the ACA pay more on average than
they did in the pre-ACA period. But even these lower income people receiving significant
premium and cost sharing subsidies end up paying more than before the ACA, largely because
the ACA subsidies fall short of the implied subsidy provided by charity and bad debt care in the
pre-ACA period.

19

As shown in Table 4, Panel A, ACA-approved coverage often does reduce the standard
deviation of out-of-pocket spending for Silver plans, (while potentially increasing the mean
value). However, the variability of OOP spending increases at all income levels for Bronze
plans. The cap on out-of-pocket payments and Silver plan cost sharing subsidies drive the
reductions in risk for Silver plans. On average, the standard deviation for OOP in Silver plans
falls even though mean spending rises with the privately insured distribution due to better
coverage.
Panel B of Table 4 translates the change in variances (pre minus post) into a change in
the risk premium, so that positive numbers indicate a fall in the risk premium after the ACA,
representing greater financial protection. The large reductions in OOP risk for Silver plans
translate into reduced risk premiums compared to pre-ACA OOP (Panel B of Table 4). In
contrast, although Bronze plans cap out-of-pocket payments, the relatively low variability in preACA OOP results in small increases in the risk premium from pre-ACA levels to post-ACA
levels using the spending distribution of the previously uninsured. The increases in risk
premiums for Bronze plans based on individually insured spending are greater, indicating less
risk protection benefits in Bronze plans compared with charity and bad debt care in the pre-ACA
period.
Estimates of total medical care spending and the value of the increased care consumed
due to insurance are presented in Table 5. The estimated values of increased care are between
$2,064 and $2,760 using the conventional approximation to measuring the welfare cost of moral
hazard, which assumes the marginal value of care is half its cost. The estimated benefits for
Bronze coverage are modestly larger than for Silver coverage because the consumer pays higher

20

out-of-pocket prices under Bronze plans and thus less of total spending is counted as deadweight
loss compared to Silver plans (with total spending assumed to be constant).
The total welfare change from obtaining coverage is calculated by subtracting the
benefits from insurance from the additional amounts paid for insurance and care. Specifically,
the difference in the risk premium and value of increased care consumed represent the benefits
from insurance, while the difference in the sum of premium and average OOP (post minus pre)
represents the price paid.
Table 6 presents estimates of welfare change by income group if all (or a random
sample) of that group were to obtain coverage. Average welfare for the uninsured population
would be estimated to decline after the ACA if all members of that population obtained
coverage. The fall in welfare is roughly the same amounts on average for Bronze and Silver
plans. At the lowest income stratum and under the assumption that spending increases, there are
welfare gains because of subsidies and increased access. Those at all higher-income levels, a
majority of the uninsured eligible for exchanges, suffer welfare losses that increase with income
because subsidies diminish and then disappear.
To examine the sensitivity of our results to health risk, the risk aversion parameter, and
the value of additional consumption, we also provide estimates for subpopulations at various risk
levels and for the entire population using a risk aversion coefficient of 0.001 and an assumption
that the value of all additional care is equal to the amount of spending. Table 7 shows the
distribution of welfare changes for subpopulations based on health risk. As expected, higher risk
groups that will benefit from community rating will sometimes be better off because they benefit
from substantially increased care but their specific premiums do not reflect that higher use.
Table 8 in contrast shows the “best-case” scenario in terms of the benefits furnished by insurance

21

for the population of formerly uninsured.17 Persons between 138 and 175 percent of FPL on
average are now substantially better off with Silver and Bronze coverage using the distribution of
privately insured spending but face welfare losses under the previously uninsured spending
distribution. The estimates still indicate welfare declines for higher-income groups, with the
estimated losses ranging up to several thousand dollars.
To summarize, we consistently find that the previously uninsured with incomes above
250 percent of FPL would on average experience welfare declines with Silver or Bronze
coverage. Tables 9 and 10 provide estimates of takeup rates calculated by subtracting from any
welfare loss the penalty associated with the individual mandate as well as the explicit subsidies.
Not unexpectedly, predicted takeup rates are high among high risks but low among the more
numerous low and average risks even in the optimistic best case scenario. Estimated takeup rates
are close to those observed in the insurance exchanges (Avalere 2015).

V. CONCLUSION
Our estimates indicate that the majority of the previously uninsured would be subject to
substantial negative financial impacts by purchasing insurance on exchanges in response to the
ACA. Impacts on welfare are less stark, with potential gains at low income and high risk levels.
However, many of the non-poor formerly uninsured are estimated to be worse off because the
subsidies are not large enough and coverage not generous enough to offset their new obligation
to pay part of the premium along with required cost sharing. This loss contributes to the
relatively low estimated takeup rates to date for exchange coverage for persons who do not
qualify for large premium subsidies and cost sharing subsidies. The result is driven by the

17

We do not provide estimates based on the lower value of additional care discussed earlier in the paper, where the
uninsured adjusted their use based on lower marginal out-of-pocket prices due to charity care.

22

uninsured paying a small fraction of their costs prior to the ACA, and this empirical pattern also
explains the low estimated value of providing Medicaid to the uninsured in recent work by
Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2015).
To be sure, benefits from ACA coverage include better protection against very large and
unexpected out-of-pocket payments, and access to additional care which provides some health
and consumption benefits. Even if a formerly uninsured person is made worse off, the rest of the
community may gain from the now “responsible” behavior. It will be important to examine the
level and pattern of these increased financial burdens to judge whether they are of sufficient
social value to justify their imposition.
