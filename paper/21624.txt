ABSTRACT
The combining of horizontal drilling and hydrofracturing unleashed a boom in oil and natural gas production
in the US. This technological shift interacts with local geology to create an exogenous shock to county
income and employment. We measure the effects of these shocks within the county where production
occurs and track their geographic propagation. Every million dollars of oil and gas extracted produces
$66,000 in wage income, $61,000 in royalty payments, and 0.78 jobs within the county. Outside the
immediate county but within the region, the economic impacts are over three times larger. Within
100 miles of the new production, one million dollars generates $243,000 in wages, $117,000 in royalties,
and 2.49 jobs. Thus, over a third of the fracking revenue stays within the regional economy. Our results
suggest new oil and gas extraction led to an increase in aggregate US employment of 725,000 and
a 0.5 percent decrease in the unemployment rate during the Great Recession.

Introduction

The technological innovation of combining horizontal drilling with hydrofracturing
has created an oil and natural gas boom within the United States. The combination
of technological change and preexisting geology has generated large income shocks in
many areas of the country. Employment in the mining industry grew by 60 percent
during a period when overall US unemployment reached 10 percent. We use the
fracking revolution to study how income and employment shocks propagate across
geography and industries.
We measure county-level impacts of new oil and gas production caused by the
fracking boom. Our identification strategy uses a comprehensive data set of annual
production (appropriately instrumented) to measure the effects on income, employment and crime. Our data allow us to know the exact value of new production taken
out of the ground in any county in a given year. Using measures of income from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we can
examine how much of the value of new production stays within the county where
the production occurs.
These income effects take several forms. First, wages of workers in the resource
extraction and transportation industries are directly impacted through participation
in the extraction process. Second, landowners are paid royalties on the value of
production taken from their land. Finally, we examine the impact on wages and
employment in industries not directly related to oil and gas production.
The county may not be the ideal level of observation because workers and
landowners may be located in counties adjacent to where new production is occurring. By examining the impact of new production at increasing distances we can
track the propagation of the shocks over space. This spatial analysis is important

2

because we are interested in how fracking impacts the entire region, not just the
immediate county. This is particularly important since substantial new fracking
activity occurs in sparsely populated counties. We also examine data aggregated to
the state level.
Several conclusions emerge from our analysis. First, the counties where extraction occurs enjoy significant economic benefits. Second, the effects grow larger as
we widen the geographic area being examined. The state-level impact on jobs and
income is approximately five times as large as the immediate county effect with most
of the impact happening within 100 miles of the drilling sites. Third, we find no
significant change in crime rates.
Each million dollars of new oil and gas production is associated with a $66,000
increase in wage income and 0.78 new jobs within the county. Roughly 40 percent
of the income increase is in industries not directly related to oil and gas extraction
such as finance, leisure, hospitality, and local government. Of the $66,000 increase in
local wages, $39,000 are wage payments to oil and gas industry workers, including
trucking, and another $27,000 are wage spillovers to workers in other industries.
There are another $61,000 in royalty payments to lease holders within the county.
The direct effects imply that roughly 10 percent of the total value of gas and oil
extracted remains in the county in the form of wages and royalty payments with
another 2.7 percent in indirect activity.
Within a 100-mile radius, each million dollars in new production is associated
with wage increases of $243,000 and 2.49 jobs, which are about three times as
large as the effects at the county level. We also find regional spillovers for royalty
payments: each million dollars generates almost $117,000 of royalty payments within
a 100-mile radius. Since royalty payments are 12 to 20 percent of the production
value, this suggests that the majority of royalty payments remain local. Overall,
3

we conclude that 36 percent of the value of new production shows up in households
within commuting distance of the drilling locations.
Our results also provide some insight into the aggregate impact of the fracking boom. A significant portion of the increase in oil and gas production occurred
during the depths of the Great Recession. With the national economy operating at
significantly less than full employment, the increased demand for labor generated by
the fracking boom almost certainly increased overall employment. Our employment
estimates suggest that an increase of 725,000 jobs were associated with new oil and
gas extraction between 2005 and 2012. Assuming no displacement from other employment, this suggests that the fracking boom lowered aggregate US unemployment
by 0.5 percent during the Great Recession.

Literature Review

There is a related and growing literature on whether or not fossil fuels create a
resource curse in a region by raising wages in one sector and crowding out other
sectors. Jacobsen and Parker (2014) find that the oil bust in the 1980s harmed
manufacturing employment more than the boom in the 1970s helped employment
in this sector. This is analogous to the Black, McKinnish and Sanders (2005) finding
that the coal bust hurt income and employment more than the boom helped.
In contrast, Allcott and Keniston (2014) find that energy extraction benefits,
rather than harms, local manufacturing employment by using exposure to national
shocks (as measured by proven reserves) as an instrument. Similarly, Weber (2013)
does not find evidence of a resource curse and instead finds that non-mining jobs
are positively correlated with mining jobs. Michaels (2011) uses data covering a
longer time horizon–from 1890 to 1990–and finds that oil abundant counties in the

4

US South saw higher population growth and higher income per capita growth than
counties without oil.
Several recent papers have focused on the fracking revolution, but use different
empirical strategies from our paper. Weber (2012) examines county-level direct
effects of gas production in three states from 1998 to 2008. Other papers have used
indirect measures of production. Fetzer (2014) examines the county-level direct
effect of any drilling activity after 2007 by instrumenting with the presence of shale.
Maniloff and Mastromonaco (2014) study the effect of the number of wells (and
a similar instrument) as a measure of production. 1 Our paper differs from the
literature in several ways: we use detailed measures of production from new wells
for all states; we study the effect during the Great Recession; and we examine
regional economic spillovers from shocks to this industry.
Our work has implications beyond an understanding of the local effects of oil
and gas fracking. We are studying a large and arguably exogenous shock that can
teach us about the size and breadth of geographic spillovers from localized economic
activity. Our estimates contribute to the literature on the economic responses to
local shocks in the spirit of Blanchard and Katz (1992), Black et al. (2005) and
Shoag (2015). Black et al. (2005) find that each coal mining job added to a county
during the coal boom created an additional 0.17 jobs in other industries. In contrast,
we find larger spillovers from fracking at both the county and state level. 2
It is worth noting that the increase in drilling activity is not universally viewed
as positive. The regions where this activity is taking place tend to be rural and
Other papers related to this topic include Bartik, Currie, Greenstone and Knittel (2014),
Considine, Watson and Considine (2011), Deller and Schreiber (2013), Marchand (2012), Wang
and Krupnick (2013), and Weber (2013).
2
For example, at the county level, each million dollars of oil extracted results in 0.49 jobs
within the natural resources and the transportation categories. But there are an additional 0.31
jobs created in other industries such as construction and leisure. This implies a spillover of 0.6
jobs for every person employed directly in extraction.

drilling activities generate significant local impacts. Newell and Raimi (2015) find
significant heterogeneity in the impact on local government finance. Media reports
have noted increases in crime and congestion that have accompanied increased economic activity.3 Many landowners and environmentalists have expressed concern
about water contamination, either from fracking fluids leaking into aquifers or surface water contamination from leaks in ponds where fracking water (fluid) is stored.
A 2015 draft study by the EPA admits this possibility but finds it to be quite rare. 4
These concerns have led to many communities questioning whether the local benefits exceed the costs. New York State has placed a moratorium on fracking while
several counties in Colorado have done the same.
Several recent papers have examined the environmental concerns with shale gas
and oil, including water quantity, water quality, local air pollution, methane leakages, and earthquakes. Howarth, Ingraffea and Engelder (2011) debate many of
these concerns and risks. In a recent paper examining people’s perceptions of the
risks from fracking, Muehlenbachs, Spiller and Timmins (forthcoming) find that
homes relying on wells for drinking water have fallen in value because of drilling
activity in Pennsylvania. The empirical evidence does find some support for these
concerns. For example, Olmstead, Muehlenbachs, Shih, Chu and Krupnick (2013)
find increases in chloride concentrations downstream of treatment plants processing
shale gas waste and increased concentrations of total suspended solids in watersheds
with new shale gas wells.
See, For example, see these three New York Times articles: Healy (2013), “As Oil Floods
Plains Towns, Crime Pours In”; Galbraith (2012), “In Oil Boom, Housing Shortages and Other
Issues”; and Urbina (2011b), “A Tainted Water Well and Concern There May Be More.”

Local Geology and the Technology of Fracking

Domestic oil production has increased every year since 2008, reversing a decline that
began in 1986. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that the US
will soon exceed the 1970s level of oil production of 11.5 million barrels per day
(EIA 2013a). As a result, the US oil and gas industries added about 300,000 jobs
from 2004 to 2012.5 Additionally, fuel prices have responded to this supply shock:
domestic natural gas prices fell by two thirds between 2005 and 2012 while global
oil prices fell by half in the fall of 2014. 6
Shale gas and oil refer to fossil fuels trapped in shale formations, which are finegrained, sedimentary rocks. While these resources have been known for decades, it
was not until the early 2000s that they began to be developed in earnest (EIA 2013b).
Wang and Krupnick (2013) point to several culminating events that lead to the shale
revolution starting in the mid-2000s. Industry combined the use of several technological innovations in horizontal drilling, hydrofracturing, and three-dimensional
seismic imaging.7 High natural gas prices enabled some firms to risk experimenting with the new technique. Finally, favorable conditions exist in many locations
throughout the United States: conditions include geology, property rights, market
Employment in the natural resources and mining sector grew from 1.68 million in 2004 to 1.98
million in 2012 (BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages). Similar changes are reported
in the BLS Current Employment Statistics for mining category, 509,000 to 800,000 over this time
period.
6
Gas prices fell from $10 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) in October 2005 to $3.35
by the end of 2012 (see http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9190us3m.htm). The oil price drop
occurs after our sample period and was due to a number of factors in addition to US crude supply.
Below, we examine whether there are asymmetric responses to prices rising or falling.
7
The process of developing shale gas and oil begins with geological surveying. New seismic
imaging technology allows geologist to better understand the structure and properties of the subsurface rocks (Bohi 1999). After permitting, a firm will develop a multi-well pad. From one
location, the company can drill eight horizontal wells and access the same reservoir volume as
sixteen vertical wells (DOE 2009). Casing and cement is installed to protect against leaks. Wells
are typically drilled thousands of feet below groundwater and then turn horizontal thousands of
feet more. Next, a firm will begin hydraulic fracturing by injecting high-pressure fracture fluid
mix of water, sand and chemicals into the well bore. This causes cracks and fractures to develop
and the hydrocarbon to be extracted.

structure, pipeline infrastructure, and water availability. Joskow (2013) discusses
the importance of deregulation in the recent developments in the gas industry.
Over the past decade, the share of US petroleum production coming from shale
resources has increased dramatically. Figure 1 shows oil and gas production separately for vertically and horizontally drilling fuels. In 2000, the amount of fuel
produced from vertically drilled wells greatly exceeded that from horizontal wells.
By 2013, this pattern has reversed and aggregate production has increased dramatically. This trend is not expected to end soon (EIA 2013a). EIA estimates that the
United States has 223 billion barrels of shale oil and 2,431 trillion cubic feet of shale
natural gas, over a third of the world’s recoverable shale resources (EIA 2013b). The
locations of this activity is geographically specific. For each county, Figure 2 shows
the cumulative value of new fossil fuel extraction per capita between 2004 and 2012.

Data Description

For our analysis we combine sectoral level data on income and employment from the
BLS, income data from the IRS, and data on oil and natural gas production from
the energy information service Drillinginfo.
From the BLS, we use the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which
has information on annual average employment and wages by county. These data
come from employers and therefore are our best measure of county-level economic
activity. These data are disaggregated into the following sectors: natural resources
and mining; trade, transportation and utilities; construction; leisure and hospitality;
financial activities; local government; education and health services; information;
manufacturing; professional and business services; and state and federal government.

Notes: We report aggregate barrels of oil produced in a given month from wells with a drilling

reports as we exclude wells with unknown drilling types. There are 5.6 MMBTU per barrel of
crude oil. Data source is drillinginfo.com.

These disaggregated data allow us to see if the income and employment effects are
restricted to sectors that are directly employed in oil and gas extraction (mining
and transportation) or whether these effects are seen in other sectors.
The IRS Statistics of Income data have county-level information on annual wages,
dividends, interest and other income. These data are likely to be less useful than the
BLS data for county-level estimation because the data are assigned to the county
where the tax form is filed by the individual rather than the location of economic
activity. For workers that are commuting, or for those that have temporarily relocated for a job, the location where they file taxes may be different from the location
where they actually perform the work and collect paychecks. These data are potentially useful in another way. The IRS data are broken into three categories: wages;
interest and dividends; and other income. 8 We are particularly interested in the
other income category because this is where royalties to land holders should appear.
These royalties can be 12 to 20 percent of the value of production (Urbina 2011a).
The crime data are from the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics of the Department of Justice.9 The UCR Program collects statistics on violent crime (murder
and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault)
and property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft) from local
agencies.
Drillinginfo collects oil and natural gas drilling information from various state
agencies for each well and month. We use fuel prices from the EIA to determine
values.10 We have BLS and Drillinginfo data from 2004 to 2014. However, the IRS
Results on the interest and dividends portion of the IRS income were always insignificant and
are not reported.

data are available with more of a lag, so we focus on 2004 to 2012 when we have all
data for all variables. All values are converted to 2014 dollars using the CPI.
Drillinginfo has information on over one million wells that were active during
our sample. We define oil wells as those wells with a well type classification of Oil
or O&G, and gas wells as those classified as Gas. We focus only on wells that begin
producing oil or gas in a given year. New oil wells account for nine percent of the
oil produced in the US during our sample. New gas wells account for 13 percent of
natural gas. We aggregate these data by county and year.
Our identification strategy relies on changes in production and changes in outcomes and hence identification derives from the states and counties that are the
major producers of each fuel. The most active counties producing oil are in California, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
and Texas. The most active gas-producing counties are in Arkansas, Colorado,
Louisiana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Utah, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
From 2005 to 2012, the new production in our sample is valued at $81 billion in oil
and $136 billion in gas.
Our county-level analysis includes all US counties with employment of more
than 446 people in 2004, at the beginning of our sample. The 63 excluded counties
represent 15 states and are the smallest two percent by employment. We exclude
these counties because there are a few with very small populations and significant
new production of oil and natural gas. Our analysis examines the value extracted
per capita: therefore, the results are sensitive to the inclusion of these counties. To
take one extreme example, Loving County Texas has over $10 million in new oil per
capita in one year with about 50 workers. For the sake of consistency, we exclude
all counties below a size threshold that excludes these outliers. The new production
in these counties is included in all the rest of our analysis including the state-level
11

results, the distance results, and the county-size results.
Our sample consists of eight years, 3,082 counties, and 24,646 county-year observations for each industry. Well data are missing for a few observations, making the
sample an unbalanced panel. The sample exhibits substantial variation in countylevel employment, with a coefficient of variation over three. For this reason, we
normalize all variables by historic employment, which we proxy for using the oneyear lag of total employment.
We construct instruments using data on the presence of shale in a region (i.e.
plays) from the EIA. We assign each county to a specific play. Small plays with
less than ten counties are combined into a single “other” category, resulting in 23
designations of plays such as the Utica, Marcellus, Devonian, Antrim, New Albany,
Barnett, and Bakken shale plays.

Empirical Framework

Our estimating equation examines the percentage change in total wages. The dependent variable ΔW agesit is the one-year change in annual wage payments across
all industries divided by the one-year lag of average employment. 11,12
The key independent variable is the total value of oil and natural gas extracted
from wells that started producing in the current year measured in million dollars
per capita, N ewV alueit . New production is the variable of interest because it represents a potentially exogenous shock to local economic activity. New production is
a function of preexisting geology and the newly introduced technology of horizontal
drilling combined with fracking. These should be independent of other shocks o cAll references to per capita data in the paper are referenced to average employment levels.
Given the large variation in county populations (levels of employment), we obtain similar but
noisier estimates if we instead regress annual changes of the level of employment on the level of
fossil fuel production.

curring within the county. Ideally these shocks should occur independent of other
county characteristics. In the Appendix, Table A1 shows that the areas with fracking are historically similar to other areas based on 2004 population, income, and
wage rates. This also shows that early adopting counties are similar to late adopting
counties.
We control for county fixed effects, αi , and year fixed effects, ωt . Standard errors
are clustered by state-year in order to control for spacial correlation. 13 For county
i in year t, we estimate:

ΔW agesit = β ∗ N ewV alueit + αi + ωt + it

Spatial Propagation

County-level analysis of the BLS data only includes employment that firms report
as being located in the county where the fracking activity is occurring. To the
extent that drillers are transient workers who are reported as being employed by
establishments in a different county (e.g. the company headquarters), county-level
results will understate the impact of new oil and gas production. In addition to
the reporting problem workers may not live and shop in the counties where the
new extraction is taking place. This will result in spillover economic activity in
neighboring counties that will not be picked up in the county-level analysis.
Examining data aggregated at the state level will deal with both of these issues.
Firms are required to pay unemployment insurance premiums in the state where
the worker is located so state level aggregates should accurately reflect the location
of work. States are not the ideal level of aggregation because they vary widely in
Clustering at the county level, which will better deal with serial correlation, does not significantly change any of our results.
13

13

size and many states contain multiple economic areas.
We further extend our county-level analysis to include new production in surrounding counties. We sum the value of new production and the change in income
with a 100 miles radius of the centroid of a county and divide it by the the population living within the 100 mile radius to generate new production and income
per capita. We estimate equation (1) on these summed values for each county. By
performing a similar analysis at different distances we can analyze the geographic
propagation of income and employment as we get farther from the source of the new
production.

5.2

Instrumental Variables

Our new production measure will be a function of the availability of the new resource
and the actions taken to extract it. While the former is clearly exogenous, the latter
may not be. It could be that some areas are fracked earlier because the cost of
gaining leases is low due to low land values or because wages are low due to high
unemployment. For this reason we will instrument for new production in each county
using geological formations.
Our main approach is to use the time series of productivity in geological regions
(a play) to predict county-level production. We generate predictions for aggregate
new production in each county for each year by estimating:

ln(N ewV alueit ) = αi + λjt + it

(2)

where αi is a dummy for each county and λjt represents a set of dummy variables for
each play-year combination. We can then generate a prediction for new production

14

per capita for each county year pair:
ˆ
N ewVˆalueit = eα̂i +λjt /popit

(3)

The predicted values for new production per capita are based on the timing of
new production for all the counties within a particular play. Each individual county
represents a small part of the play’s production so that the instrument is exogenous
with respect to the idiosyncratic rollout of fracking within individual counties. We
end up with 23 plays with some counties in multiple plays. On average each play
contains 32 counties.
These predicted values will be used as instruments in an IV regression where
new production is instrumented using our predicted values. We are using this two
step process to generate instruments because the functional form for predicting new
production is very different than the functional form when we specify the regression. We will focus on new production per person in our estimations because we
are interested in how new production impacts communities. The availability of new
production is geographic and orthogonal to the presence of people. A log specification for generating predicted values allows us to include a multiplicative dummy
for each county. The predicted values for each county will incorporate the timing of
new production from the play dummies while controlling for the idiosyncratic level
of production in each county. Since we are getting all of our identification in the
second stage from the timing of new production our instruments will be valid.

Income and Employment Results

Table 1 shows the results of estimating equation (1) for aggregate wages from the
BLS, and adjusted gross income (AGI), wages, and other income from the IRS.
Each entry in the table represents the coefficient from a different regression. The
OLS estimates suggest that one million dollars of new oil and gas production in
associated with a BLS wage increase of $35,000 within the county. The impact
increases substantially when we expand the geographic area of interest. At a 100
mile radius from the county centroid each million dollars of new production per
capita is associated with wage increases of $214,000. Aggregated to the state level
this increases to $287,000.
As described in the previous section, the OLS results may be biased because
the choice of counties for drilling may be non-random. We deal with this potential
endogeneity by generating instruments based on the potential for fracking within
a particular county based on the geology of the region. For the remainder of the
paper we will confine our discussion to IV estimation while continuing to report
OLS results in the tables.
Panel B of Table 1 reports our IV results. 14 These estimates suggest that one
million dollars of new oil and gas production in associated with a BLS wage increase
of $66,000 within the county. This increases substantially as we look more regionally.
At a 100 mile radius from the county centroid each million dollars of new production
is associated with wage increases of $243,000. Aggregated to the state level this
increases to $343,000.
Results using IRS data suggest smaller wage effects, with one million of new
production associated with $27,000 in increased wages at the county level, $84,000
The first-stage results are reported in Table A2. Separate estimates are reported for oil values,
natural gas values, and the combined values. All F-stats are greater than 10.

16

within a 100 mile radius, and $171,000 at the state level. These point estimates
are one half to one third of the corresponding BLS wage results. We will tend to
rely on the BLS wage data when available because the BLS data reflect the county
where the firm is located, not where taxes are filed. We feel that this more reliably
captures the geographic dispersion of wages from new production and is therefore
measured with less error than the IRS data. This measurement error is attenuating
our coefficients toward zero in the IRS income results.
The main advantage of using the IRS data is that the IRS Income measures
capture the income from royalty payments that is unavailable from the BLS. We
define IRS Other Income to be the difference between AGI and the sum of wages
and salaries, dividends, interest, and capital gains. This is an imperfect measure
of royalty income since it also includes business income and partnership income.
However since we are using changes in the this category for counties with a great
deal of new oil and gas extraction, the change in the royalty component is likely
to dominate the change in non-royalty income. If anything we risk overstating the
effects of new oil and gas production on royalties since new production in a county
will also raise business income. 15
Our results suggest that one million dollars of new production leads to $61,000 at
the county level and $117,000 at the 100 mile level. At the state level, our coefficients
for IRS other are extremely noisy with insignificant point estimates. Combining the
BLS wage results with the IRS Other estimates from royalty payments we find that
almost 16 percent of the value of new production remains in the county of production
and 36 percent stays within a 100 mile radius.
Regressions on dividends, interest, and capital gains show no significant relationship with new
oil and gas production and are therefore not included in our tables.

Geographic Dispersion of Income

The choice of a 100 mile radius for Table 1 was not a random one. Figure 3 shows
the results of a series of regressions of county-level income changes against the value
of new production within a radius of the centroid of the county. 16 As the distance
is increased, production from other counties is included in the analysis including
production occurring in other states. The coefficients at zero represent the impact
of production located within the county (these coefficients are identical to the values
reported in Table 1). Between zero and 50 miles very little new production is being
added. As we move from 50 to 100 miles production in adjacent counties is taken
into account and the coefficients rise. From 100 to 200 miles the coefficient on
Wages flattens while the coefficient on IRS Other Income continues to rise modestly.
This distance pattern is consistent with a commuting zone of 100 miles being the
most appropriate unit of observation. The continued rise of IRS Other income past
100 miles may indicate that land ownership is more geographically dispersed than
employment though we cannot reject that the impact at 100 miles is the same as at
200 miles.
Splitting the results by county size provides additional evidence on the propagation of shocks in Table A3. We bin counties into 10 equally-sized deciles by initial
employment and estimate the main coefficient separately for each. Counties with
over 8,000 workers see significantly larger effects of new production that are statistically similar to the state results. This suggests that counties with larger populations
are more likely to see the employment gains remain within the county while smaller
counties will draw on surrounding counties for workers.

squares, we regress this measure on the aggregated total value (in millions of dollars) from wells
opened in the current year per capita within the corresponding circle. See text for discussion of
the instrument. We control for county and year fixed effects. The figure reports the coefficient
estimates and the 95 percent confidence interval where the standard errors are clustered by

Industry-Level Income

Table 2 breaks down the BLS income results by industry. We will focus on the
IV results in Panel B. As in the previous section we find that one million dollars
of new production is associated with $66,000 of additional wages at the county
level. In Table 2 we see that $24,000 occurs in mining, and $16,000 in trade and
transportation. Added together, roughly two thirds of the income is in sectors that
are directly involved in extracting new gas and oil. Of the remainder, the largest
impact is in construction.
At higher levels of aggregation the story is quite similar. Each million dollars of
new production is associated with $243,000 at the 100 mile level with $105,000 in
mining and $63,000 in transportation. At the state level wages increase $343,000
overall with $120,000 in mining and $75,000 in transportation. In all three cases
roughly two thirds of the wage increases occur in sectors directly related to extraction.

7

Employment

We find similar patterns in employment. Table 3 reports the results of regressions
using BLS employment by industry. Each million dollars of additional oil or gas
production generates an employment increase of 0.78 at the county level. Of this,
0.28 is in mining and 0.21 in transportation. At the 100 mile level we find an
employment increase of 2.49 with 0.95 in mining and 0.73 in transportation. At the
state level we find an employment increase of 3.34 with 1.21 in mining and 0.91 in
transportation. As with the income results, we find that about two thirds of the
increase is in mining and transportation. Of the remaining one third construction
plays the largest role followed by leisure.
20

Figure 4 shows the results of a series of regressions of county-level employment
changes against the value of new production within a radius of the centroid of the
county. Mirroring the income results, employment effects are much larger as one
considers effects beyond the immediate county. The employment effects reach a
maximum at 100 miles suggesting that the commuting radius is the correct unit of
observation, not the county.
The impact of new production within a 100 mile radius are over three times as
large as with the county and quite similar to the impact at the state. This suggests
that our state results are driven by impacts outside the immediate county, but still
within the region where new production is located. Counties within the shale regions
are therefore seeing overall employment and wage effects that are substantially larger
than suggested by the county-level results and closer to the state results.
The income and employment effects are extremely similar and are consistent
with each new job in a county paying roughly $100,000. We cannot, however say
with certainty whether this is the correct interpretation. It seems likely that the
increased activity led to a combination of new jobs along with higher wages for
existing jobs within the county and region. We cannot distinguish between these
two effects.

Robustness
Wells versus Production

Our preferred specifications use the per capita change in the value of oil and gas
production on the right hand side. There are several alternative measures of fracking
activity that were also considered. The increase in production value is a combination
of new wells drilled, the average production of each new well, and the price of oil and

gas during the production period. Because we include time effects in all regressions,
changes in oil and gas prices play a minor role.
In Table A4, we consider whether the number of new wells has predictive power
independent of production because the process suggests a fixed labor cost to creating
a well regardless of the wells productivity. This did not turn out to be the case.
In regressions including both the value of production and well data, we find that
production data have greater predictive power. Part of the explanation may be
that productive wells are re-fracked more often and involve more trucking and more
extensive horizontal drilling. It may also be that the willingness to invest in new
wells is proportional to the expected production from these wells, leading to a strong
correlation between the costs of opening a well and the value of new production.
Because the well and production data are highly correlated with each other it is not
possible to separate out the effects.

8.2

Oil versus Gas

It is possible that new oil drilling and new gas drilling have different impacts. The
point estimates when we estimate new oil extraction and new gas production separately suggest that oil has a larger impact on wages than natural gas ($260,000
in wages per million for oil production versus $180,000 for gas production for our
preferred specification of county plus 100 miles using instrumental variables), but
that these differences are not statistically significant (Table A5).
Figure A2 shows the results split by oil and gas at varying distances from the
county centroid. Between 0 and 100 miles the impact of natural gas and oil are
very similar. The impact of oil flattens out at distances larger than 100 miles while
natural gas continues to have marginal effect out to 200 miles, though the standard
errors are quite large.
23

8.3

Rising versus Falling Fossil Fuel Prices

Oil prices have played a role in the timing of the fracking boom, with high prices
between 2005 and 2008, followed by a collapse during the Great Recession. We may
worry that our results are being driven by periods of high oil prices in ways not
captured by time dummies. We therefore split our sample by periods of rising and
falling prices. Oil and natural gas prices generally move together, but there are a
few periods where they diverge. We therefore split the sample based on whether a
county sees rising or falling prices for the dominant fuel in that county. Both the
rising and falling price samples include all the non-producing counties as a control
group. Table A6 shows our main results for each of these samples. The results do
not seem to be affected by the direction of prices.

8.4

More Recent Data

Our analysis has focused on the period 2005-2012 due to availability of the IRS data.
The BLS data is available through 2014. Tables A7 and A8 presents our results for
this extended sample using the BLS data. Adding these additional data reduces the
magnitude of all of our coefficients somewhat with about a twenty percent reduction
in our preferred IV specification. All coefficients remain highly significant.
In order to explore this further we split the sample into three periods. The first
period, 2005 to 2008, includes the early years of the fracking boom but does not
include the Great Recession. The second period, 2009 to 2011 is during the Great
Recession and ends with our IRS sample. For the final period, 2012 to 2014, we
only have BLS data. This is a period with falling unemployment and a more mature
fracking industry. Table A9 present the results across these three time periods. The
first and second periods are very similar to each other though it is clear that the

24

period during the Great Recession is providing a lot of the identification. This
suggests that our results are not being driven by the labor market weakness of the
recession. The results from the period 2012 to 2014 are extremely noisy.

9

Crime

A major concern with the fracking boom is the local impact on crime. Several
New York Times articles have discussed large crime increases in North Dakota and
Montana towns.17 In Table 4, we examine the impact of new production on crime
at the county level. Our OLS results show no significant increase in crime in any
category. For the IV results, the coefficient on murder is significant at the 10 percent
level. Given that we find only one coefficient that is weakly statistically significant
in a table of 16 coefficients, we do not consider our results to be evidence of crime
increases as a result of fracking.
These news articles focus solely on the top five to ten counties as ranked by new
production per capita. In our data, the six counties in the top one percent of oil
drilling activity have over $750,000 of new production per capita during our sample
period. Our point estimate multiplied by production at the 99th percentile suggests
a violent crime rate increase of 40 percent with a 95 percent confidence interval of
-186 percent to +265 percent, and a 12 percent decrease in property crime with a 95
percent confidence interval of -122 percent to 98 percent. While these estimates do
not preclude the possibility of large increases in crime in some counties as a result
of new drilling activity, our analysis cannot reject relatively small increases in crime
for even the largest oil producing counties.
17

For example, crime has been written about Dickinson and Watford City, ND (Healy 2013).

25

10

Discussion

What does this mean for the typical county that has fracking activity? This question is complicated by the extremely skewed distribution of production within the
counties where fracking is taking place. There are 739 counties in the US that had
either new oil or gas production in the first year of our sample, 2005. The median
county in this group had $4,900 of new production per capita over the sample period. Our results imply a 0.38 percent increase in employment and a $320 increase
in wages per capita. Counties at the 75th percentile in new production have over
five times the production of the median at $25,900 per capita. Our results suggest
a 2.00 percent increase in employment and a $1,700 increase in wages per capita
in these 140 counties. The top five percent of counties (about 37 counties) saw
production increases in excess of $290,000 per capita associated with a 23 percent
increase in employment and a $19,000 increase in wages per capita.
This analysis only considers the direct impact on the county. Our results suggest
that including the surrounding counties increases the impact by a factor of more
than three. To put this in perspective we can consider a hypothetical state with
500,000 workers. The state contains one centrally located county of 10,000 workers
that extracts one million dollars of new oil and gas per capita. 18 Roughly one quarter
of the oil and gas rights are held by county residents with the other three quarters
held by other residents of the state living within a 100 mile radius.
After fracking, employment in our county rises by 78 percent to 17,800. County
income from employment rises by 88 percent. Additionally, each of the incumbent
workers receives an average of $38,000 in royalty payments. At the state level,
employment rises by 33,400, a 7 percent increase. 19 The state unemployment rate
18
19

Our hypothetical state is roughly based on production figures from North Dakota.
Coefficients for employment and income for the state level analysis are taken from the IV

26

falls. Aggregate state wage income rises by 20 percent. Additionally, each of the
incumbent workers receives an average of $2,300 in royalty payments.
Given that the counties where fracking is taking place are geographically clustered, the propagation of shocks over 100 miles suggests that the overall impact on
fracking counties is larger than would be expected if their production was taken
in isolation because they also benefit from production in the surrounding counties.
This may be particularly relevant when discussing fracking bans that affect entire
regions, like in New York State.
Aggregating to the national level, we find $217 billion worth of new production
over our sample period. In mining, our state level IV coefficient of 1.21 suggests
262,000 new mining jobs. Over the same period there was an increase of about
300,000 jobs in mining and natural resources nationally. Our results can therefore
account for most of the US employment gain in the mining sector. We cannot reject
that the entire increase in mining is due to the new production in our sample. Multiplying this by our overall (all industries) state level jobs coefficient of 3.34 suggests
that 725,000 new jobs were created across the nation due to the new production.
Given a labor force of approximately 150 million in the US this suggests a 0.5 percent increase in US aggregate employment due to new production of oil and natural
gas from 2005-2012, with an identical reduction of the US unemployment rate.

11

Conclusion

Our analysis is among the first comprehensive examinations of the effects of fracking
on income, employment, and crime. Fracking is particularly interesting because we
know the exact location of the wells and are able to measure the impacts at ever
results of Tables 1 and 2. For royalties, we use the 100 miles results.

widening levels of geography. New production in our data is being driven by new
drilling technology interacted with the preexistence of appropriate geography. Our
new production is therefore exogenous to economic conditions at the time of the
new drilling. This allows us to study how income shocks propagate through local
and regional economies.
Figure 5 summarizes our results. At the county level (at 0 miles distance) our
estimates suggest that roughly 13 percent of the value extracted stays in the county
in the form of higher income. Wages and royalty payments each account for about
half of the increase. Two thirds of the increased wages is in the mining and trucking
industries, with the remainder spilling over to construction, hospitality, banking,
and local government.
While county impacts are substantial, the regional effects are several times larger.
As we move out to 100 miles 36 percent of the new value extracted remains within

28

the region. Two thirds of the income increase is in the form of higher wares and one
third as royalties. Mining accounts for 40 percent of the wage increase, trucking 25
percent, with the remainder in other industries.
We find substantial increases in regional employment due to fracking. Each
million dollar of new production generates an increase in employment of 0.78 workers
at the county level, 2.49 within 100 miles, and 3.34 within the state. Aggregating
nationally we can explain all of the observed 300,000 increase in mining and oil
employment over our sample. Aggregating to the national level we conclude that
aggregate employment rose by 725,000 jobs due to fracking, causing a reduction in
the US unemployment rate of 0.5 percent during the Great Recession. This almost
certainly understates the impact as it only takes into account the direct impact of
the value of new extraction. For much of the nation the main impact of the fracking
boom was lower natural gas prices which do not play a role in our analysis.

Notes: We estimate the aggregate one-year change in annual income per capita for circles of
various radii. We include all counties for whom the distance between the centroids of the
originating county and each other county is within a given distance. We regress this measure on
the aggregated total value (in millions of dollars) from wells opened in the current year per
capita within the corresponding circle. We control for county and year fixed effects. The figure
reports the coefficient estimates and the 95 percent confidence interval where the standard errors
are clustered by state-year.
