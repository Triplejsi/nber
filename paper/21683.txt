Rosca Meets Formal Credit Market

ABSTRACT
Rotating Savings and Credit Association (Rosca) is an important informal financial institution in many
parts of the world used by participants to share income risks. What is the role of Rosca when formal
credit market is introduced? We develop a model in which risk-averse participants attempt to hedge
against their private income shocks with access to both Rosca and the formal credit and investigate
their interactions. Using the gap of the borrowing and saving interest rates as a measure of the imperfectness
of the credit market, we compare three cases: (i) Rosca without credit market; (ii) Rosca with a perfect
credit market; (iii) Rosca with an imperfect credit market. We show that a perfect credit market completely
crowds out the role of Rosca. However, when credit market is present but imperfect, we show that
Rosca and the formal credit market can complement each other in improving social welfare. Interestingly,
we find that the social welfare in an environment with both Rosca and formal credit market does not
necessarily increase monotonically as the imperfectness of the credit market converges to zero.

Introduction

Rotating savings and credit associations (Roscas) are important informal financial institutions
around the world. Most common in developing countries, they are also popular among immigrant
groups in the United States.1 All Roscas share the following common feature: a group of individuals,
most likely closely connected in some social networks, commit to contribute a fixed sum of money
into a “pot” in each of the equally-spaced periods during the life of the Rosca; in each period, the
“pot” is then allocated to one of its members through some mechanism. The mechanism through
which the “pot” is allocated is one of the key dimensions of the many variations of how Roscas
operate around the world, as documented by the classic anthropological studies of Roscas by Geertz
(1962) and Ardener (1964).
Two main varieties are random Rosca and bidding Rosca.2 In a random Rosca, the pot in each
period is allocated to one of the members determined by the draw of lots, with earlier winners
excluded from latter draws until each member of the Rosca has received the pot once. In a bidding Rosca, auctions are used to determine the priority of accessing the pot. In each period, the
individual who bids more than the competitors in the form of a pledge of higher contributions to
the Rosca is chosen to access the pot. As in the random Rosca, the earlier winners are excluded
from latter auctions. In a seminal paper, Besley, Coate and Loury (1993) provide rigorous comparisons of random and bidding Roscas in an environment where individuals save for the purchase of
indivisible durable goods where the agents cannot save or borrow by their own. Besley, Coate and
Loury (1994) further compare the efficiency properties of allocations achieved by random and bidding Roscas and those achieved with a credit market, and with efficient allocations more generally.
They find that neither form of Rosca is efficient.3
So far almost all existing studies on Rosca have assumed that Rosca participants do not have
access to formal credit markets. By formal credit markets, we mean that an individual can borrow
and save at interest rates that are independent of the realizations of her income and the income of
the fellow members in their social network. If borrowing and saving interest rates are identical, we
say that the credit market is “perfect;”4 and if the borrowing interest rate is higher than the saving
interest rate, we say that the financial market is “imperfect;” moreover, we use the borrowing-saving

Roscas are called by many different names around the world. They are called Hui in China, chit funds in India,
Susu in Ghana, tontines in Senegal, cheetu in Sri Lanka, to name a few examples. Light (1972) and Bonnett (1981)
respectively documented the use of Roscas among Korean and West India immigrants in the United States. See also
Adams and Canavesi de Sahonero (1989), Aleem (1990), Kimuyu (1999) for the use of Roscas in Bolivia, Pakistan
and East Africa respectively.

Other forms of allocation mechanisms are described in Ardener (1964), but random and bidding Roscas are the
two most common mechanisms.

See also Kovsted and Lyk-Jesen (1999) who study Rosca as a form of savings for lumpy investment.

The notion of “perfect credit market” used in our paper differs from the concept of “complete market” which
means that there are Arrow-Debru securities for every contingency, and accordingly interest rates will differ by the
state of nature.

interest rate gap as a measure of the “imperfectness” of the credit market: the larger the gap, the
more imperfect is the credit market.
Indeed, it is a somewhat accepted wisdom in the literature that Roscas, as informal financial
institutions, exist because of the lack of formal credit markets; moreover, it is expected that the
development of formal credit markets will lead to the eventual disappearance of Roscas. While it
is undoubtedly true that Roscas are more commonly observed in developing countries with underdeveloped formal credit markets, theoretically it remains unclear whether the economic role of
Roscas will vanish when individuals can access the formal credit market. In reality, even in some
developing countries, Rosca participants are not completely isolated from the formal credit market
and they may have some, albeit limited, access to the formal credit market. For example, Zhang
(2001), based on surveys of active Rosca participants in Southeastern China, found that more than
35 percent of Rosca participants who experienced adverse incomes shocks and were thus unable to
pay their pledged contribution to the Roscas borrowed from formal credit markets to fulfil their
Rosca obligations; moreover, 40 percent of Rosca participants in those areas reported lending some
of their Rosca winnings to the formal credit market. In other words, for Rosca participants in those
areas there are active interactions between Roscas and formal credit markets.
These observations raise some important questions. How can we rationalize active Rosca operations in the presence of a formal credit market? What is the economic role of Roscas when
individuals can both lend and borrow in a formal credit market? Does the importance of Rosca
decrease monotonically with the “perfectness” of the formal credit market? Does social welfare
increase monotonically with the “perfectness” of the formal credit market, given the presence of
Rosca?
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation on the interactions between the Rosca
and the formal credit market. We identify two competing forces in such interactions. On the
one hand, in the absence of formal credit market, although Rosca – with a proper size – is ex
ante welfare improving, it introduces a new risk induced by the uncertainty in the allocation of the
money pot. Since the formal credit market enables Rosca participants to hedge the risks of winning
or losing the Rosca, it may improve welfare by reducing the cost of participating in Rosca. In this
sense, the access to the formal credit market complements Rosca participation.
On the other hand, having access to the formal credit market increases the value of outside
option, making it more difficult to satisfy the incentive compatibility and the participation constraints for Rosca. Indeed, we show that in the extreme case when the credit market is perfect,
the role of Rosca disappears. However, if the formal credit market is imperfect, i.e. if there is a
borrowing-saving interest rate gap, we show that participating in Rosca leads to an improvement,
both in the ex ante and ex post sense, in participants’ welfare.
Interestingly, we find that social welfare does not monotonically increase as the imperfectness
of the credit market is reduced. Specifically, we provide conditions under which social welfare is
higher in an environment with a positive borrowing-saving interest rate gap that sustains Rosca
participation than that in an environment with a perfect credit market. Our finding implies that the
2

presence of an imperfect credit market may facilitate, rather than substitute, Rosca participation
because the Rosca participants may use the credit market to smooth the risk associated with losing
or winning the money pot in the Rosca bidding.5
The idea that Rosca may serve as a form of insurance for its participants is not new. Calomiris
and Rajaraman (1998) make a forceful intuitive argument for the insurance role of Rosca. Klonner
(2000, 2003) introduces a model of Rosca as an insurance mechanism where individuals privately
observe their future incomes, but his model does not consider the possibility of a formal credit
market. He shows that individuals will prefer bidding Roscas to random Roscas if the temporal
risk aversion is not greater than the static risk aversion.
There are also several papers that analyze Rosca bidding games with private information. Kuo
(1993) analyzes the equilibrium of a bidding Rosca where myopic participants’ private information is
their discount factors; moreover, he assumes that their discount factors are independently redrawn
in every period. Thus in Kuo (1993), Rosca biddings are effectively reduced to a sequence of independent auctions. Kovsted and Lyk-Jenson (1999) study the role of Roscas in financing indivisible
investment expenditures where individuals differ in their privately observed rate of returns. They
only allow individuals to access the formal credit markets when there is a gap between the money
pot won in the Rosca and the necessary lumpy investment. Besley and Levenson (1996a, 1996b)
and Handa and Kirton (1999) present empirical evidence for the role of the Rosca in saving for
durable good purchases and indivisible investment. Yu (2014) investigates how well different Rosca
designs serve to accelerate investment in a context where participants with different entrepreneurial
skills use Rosca to fund investment projects. He did not allow the entrepreneurs to access formal
credit market. Using both reduced-form and structural methods, Kaboski and Townsend (2012a,
2012b) studied the impact of the introduction of an exogenous, large-scale, microcredit intervention program, the Thai Million Baht Village Fund program on the villagers’ short-term credit,
consumption, agricultural investment, income and asset growth.
Finally, our theoretical model of Rosca bidding in the presence of credit markets also contributes
to the auction literature. Three important features of Rosca bidding differentiate our model from
the standard auction model. First, in Rosca bidding there is no pre-assigned “buyers” and “sellers”; rather, the roles of “sellers” (i.e., “lenders”) and “buyers” (i.e., “borrowers”) are determined
endogenously. Second, in standard private value auctions a bidder cares about the bids of others
only to the extent that the opponents’ bids affect her probability of winning; in Rosca bidding,
however, the opponents’ bid will affect the money in the pot in subsequent rounds and thus directly
affect the bidder’s continuation value even if she loses the bidding in the current round. Third,
because Rosca participants can access the formal credit market every period, in this model bidders’
valuations are endogenously derived from the value function of an optimal consumption/saving
5

In a different setting, Krueger and Perri (2011) study the interaction between public income insurance (through
progressive income taxation) and incomplete private risk sharing. They show that the fundamental friction that limits
private risk sharing in the first place is crucial in determining whether the provision of public insurance improves or
reduces social welfare.

problem.6
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the basic model
and discuss two benchmark cases, one without access to any credit market and another with access
to a perfect credit market. In Section 4 we investigate the performance of Rosca with an imperfect
formal credit market, i.e., where the borrowing interest rate is higher than the saving interest rate.
We show that in this environment, Rosca is welfare improving. In Section 5 we show that ex ante
welfare is non-monotonic with respect to the imperfectness of the formal credit market. In Section
6, we conclude and provide some additional discussions. All proofs are contained in the Appendix.

The Model

In this section, we first describe a two-period model of bidding Rosca in the presence of a formal
credit market where individuals can borrow and lend at interest rates rb and rs respectively.
Environment.
function

Consider two risk averse agents, indexed by i = 1, 2, with time-additive utility
u(ci1 ) + δEu(C2i ),

where cit , t = 1, 2, is agent i0 s period-t consumption, δ ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor.7 We assume
that u(·) is twice differentiable, strictly increasing, strictly concave, and satisfies Inada conditions.
The income process for individual i in period t, denoted by Yti , consists of a risk-free component
ȳ > 0, and with probability 1 − p, a negative income shock Xti drawn from CDF F (·) . Formally,
Yti = ȳ − Xti ,
where with probability p ∈ (0, 1) , Xti = 0; and with probability 1 − p, Xti ∼ F (·) on the support
(x, x̄] with x ≥ 0. We assume that F (·) is associated with a continuous density f (·), and that the
income shock realizations are independent across agents and periods.
Credit Market and Rosca. In the absence of Rosca, each individual has access to a credit
market where they can borrow at interest rate rb and lend at interest rate rs ≤ rb .
The two agents may also form a Rosca. If they do, they need to decide its size m, which is
the amount of money each has to contribute to the pot each period. We assume that the Rosca
will allocate the priority of using the pot through a premium-bidding auction. More specifically, a
premium-bidding auction is organized as follows. Each agent, after the realization of her income
in period 1, submits a bid indicating how much premium she is willing to add to the mandatory
6

The first two features also appear in Klonner (2003), but the third feature is unique in this paper. Hubbard,
Paarsch and Wright (2013) also study the equilibrium of a discount bidding Rosca where participants have private investment returns as a sequential first-price, sealed-bid auction within the risk-neutral symmetric independent
private-values paradigm. As in all existing literature, they assume agents do not have access to formal credit market.

size m in period 2 if she wins the right to use the pot in period 1. The one who submits the higher
premium bid wins the right to use the pot. The winner has to honor her bid in the second period.
It is important to emphasize that the credit market is always accessible to the agents even after
the formation of a Rosca.
Timing. The timing of the game is depicted in Figure 1. In the beginning of period 1 and before
the realizations of period-1 income shocks, the two agents decide whether to form a Rosca, and
if so, the size m of the Rosca. Then each agent observes her period-1 income shock, which is her
private information. If no Rosca is formed, then the two agents will only use the credit market to
insure their income risks; if a Rosca is formed, then the agents can use both the Rosca and the
credit market to insure their income risks. In a Rosca, the agents submit their premium bid after
realizing their period-1 income shocks, and the winner is able to use the pot money in period 1.
Agents make consumption and saving decisions after the Rosca bidding. Then time moves to the
second period when the period-2 income shocks are realized. The winner of the period-1 Rosca
bidding contributes m plus her winning premium bid to the pot, which is received by the loser of
the period-1 bidding in period 2. Both agents then make period-2 consumption decisions.
Cases We Consider in this Paper. In the paper we will discuss three cases of the above model
to investigate the interactions between Rosca and formal credit markets based on variations of rs
and rb . The first case is the benchmark case of no formal credit markets, which is captured by
rs = −1 and rb → ∞; i.e., there is no borrowing and saving. Note that to justify the statement
that rs = −1 in the case of no formal credit markets, we assume that the “income” is in the form
of non-storable perishable goods prior to the introduction of the formal credit market. The second
case is another benchmark case where there is a perfect credit market, which is represented by
rb = rs = r > 0, i.e., agents can borrow and save at the same interest rates. These two benchmark
cases will be analyzed in Section 3. The third case is the general case of imperfect formal credit
markets, namely, rb > rs ≥ 0, which we will analyze in Section 4. Table 1 summarizes these cases.

Benchmark Cases

3.1

Case I: Rosca without a Formal Credit Market

We first consider a benchmark case of Rosca without access to any formal credit market, where
the Rosca allocation is determined through premium bidding. That is, at any round the participant
who bids to contribute the highest premium payment beyond the agreed-upon size m in latter
rounds of the Rosca is allocated the right to access the money pot in this round.
3.1.1

The Bidding Equilibrium

If an individual does not participate in Rosca, then without access to any formal credit market,
the consumption decision of a representative agent (say, individual 1), following the realization of
the first period’s income y1 , is simply, c∗1 = y1 = ȳ − x1 .8 Her utility without Rosca is:9
VIn (y1 ) = u(y1 ) + δEu(Y2 ),

(1)

where the superscript “n” is mnemonic for “no Rosca.”
If individual 1 participates in a Rosca with size m, and wins the period-1 pot by bidding b, her
expected utility is
VIw (b; y1 ) = u(y1 + m) + δEu(Y2 − m − b).
(2)
If she participates in the Rosca and loses the bidding in the first period, her expected utility given
her opponent’s bid b̂, is:10
VIf (b̂; y1 ) = u(y1 − m) + δEu(Y2 + m + b̂).

(3)

We now characterize the equilibrium bidding strategy. Without loss of generality, let us consider
bidder 1. Suppose that her opponent follows a bidding strategy bI (·) that satisfies b0I (·) > 0.
Consider the revelation mechanism for bidder 1 with type x > x. The expected utility for bidder
1 of type-x from reporting x̃ is given by:

 


UI (x, x̃) = Pr X j = 0 + 1 − Pr(X j = 0) Pr x < X j ≤ x̃ VIw (bI (x̃); ȳ − x)



+
1 − Pr(X j = 0) Pr X j > x̃ E[ VIf (bI X j ; ȳ − x) X j > x̃],
(4)
8

For notational simplicity, we omit the superscript i for agent i whenever doing so would not cause confusion.

9

We use subscript “I” in value functions, bidding functions etc., to denote this is for case I. Similar subscripts are
used for cases II and III below.
10

The superscripts “w” and “f ” are mnemonic for “winning the Rosca bidding” and “failing to win the Rosca
bidding” respectivey.

6

where X j denotes the period-1 income shock of agent 10 s opponent (i.e., agent 2). To understand
this expression, note that the first term is the expected utility for a type-x bidder 1 from reporting x̃
and win the period 1 bidding. Such mis-reporting will lead the mechanism to submit a bid of bI (x̃)
for her and this bid will win against her opponent with type less than x̃, which occurs with the prob 


ability Pr X j = 0 + 1 − Pr(X j = 0) Pr x < X j ≤ x̃ , and winning with a premium bid of bI (x̃)
will yield a continuation value of VIw (bI (x̃); ȳ − x) . The second term can be similarly understood:



with probability 1 − Pr(X j = 0) Pr X j > x̃ the opponent’s type will be drawn from (x̃, x] and
bidder 1 will lose the auction when submitting the bid bI (x̃) . However, bidder 1’s continuation

value from losing the auction depends on the premium bid submitted by her opponent bI X j ,

thus bidder 1’s expected continuation value from losing is given by E[ VIf (bI X j ; ȳ − x) X j > x̃].
Using the distribution of X j , we can rewrite (4) as:
UI (x, x̃) = [p + (1 − p) F

(x̃)] VIw

(bI (x̃); ȳ − x) + (1 − p)

(5)

The first-order condition for incentive compatibility (IC) requires that

= 0,
x̃=x

which yields
b0I (x) =

For type-0 bidder, if she reports her type truthfully, her interim payoff is given by:

where the first term reflects the probability of tying when her opponent is also of type-0 (occurring

with probability Pr X j = 0 ) in which case she will obtain VIw (bI (0); ȳ) and VIf (bI (0); ȳ) with
equal probability; the second term is the expected payoff in the case when her opponent’s type is
higher than x. If type-0 bidder deviates to some x̃ > x, the expression UI (0, x̃) is analogous to (5).
The following proposition characterizes the equilibrium:
Proposition 1 Suppose that there exists b0 ≥ 0 such that
VIw (b0 ; ȳ) ≤ VIf (b0 ; ȳ)

(8)

VIw (b0 ; ȳ − x) ≥ VIf (b0 ; ȳ − x) .

(9)

and

Then the solution to differential equation (6) with boundary condition bI (0) = limx→x bI (x) = b0
specifies a symmetric Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) in the Rosca bidding in period 1. Moreover,
the equilibrium bidding function bI (·) is non-negative and increasing.
7

Condition (8) means that the agent without shocks prefers not to win with bid b0 ; while condition
(9) means that the agent with the smallest negative shock prefers to win with bid b0 . In particular,
when x = 0, the two conditions (8) and (9) collapse into one, namely, there is a b0 ≥ 0 such that:
VIw (b0 ; ȳ) = VIf (b0 ; ȳ) .

Welfare Evaluations

The ex ante welfare gain from participating in a Rosca with size m relative to no Rosca participation, denoted by ∆WI (m) , is given by:
∆WI (m) = p∆UI (0; m) + (1 − p)E [ ∆UI (X; m)| X > x] ,

(11)

where
∆UI (x; m) = UI (x, x) − VIn (ȳ − x)
is the interim welfare gain of type-x bidder from participating in the Rosca relative to no participation.11
Proposition 2 If there is no access to a credit market and 0 < δ < u0 (ȳ)/ Eu0 (Y2 ), then
d∆WI (m)
dm

> 0.
m=0

An immediate corollary of Proposition 2 is that a Rosca with an optimally chosen size m∗ > 0
can improve the participants’ ex ante welfare. The intuition for the ex ante welfare gain from a
Rosca is as follows. The potential benefit from Rosca is to smooth the income risk by transferring
money m from the higher income state to the lower one. Taking p = 0 as an example, the potential
benefit from participating in Rosca of size m in the first period is:
Z x̄
Z x̄
Z x̄

[1 − F (x)]u(ȳ − x − m)dF (x) −
u(ȳ − x)dF (x),
(12)
x

x

0

where, if we recall the explanation underlying (4), the first term is the expected first period’s utility
if she wins (with probability F (x), she gets utility u(ȳ − x + m)), the second term is the expected
first period’s utility if she loses (with probability 1 − F (x), she gets utility u(ȳ − x − m)), and the
third term is the expected utility without Rosca participation. The marginal potential benefits
from Rosca in the first period, at m sufficiently close to 0, can be obtained by taking derivative of
(12) with respect to m, and is given by:
Z x̄
Z x̄

u (ȳ − x)dF (x) −
u0 (ȳ − x)dF (x) > 0,

11

Recall that UI (x, x) as given by Eq. (5) is type-x agent’s expected welfare from participating in a Rosca with
size m, and VIn (ȳ − x) as given by Eq. (1) is type-x agent’s expected welfare with no Rosca participation.

8

which is the difference between the expectation of the first-order statistic of marginal utility and
the expected marginal utility.

where the first term in the first line is the expected second period’s utility if she wins (with

conditional expected utility x δEu Y2 + m + bI (xj ) dF (xj )/ [1 − F (x)]), and the third term is
the expected utility without participating Rosca; and the equality follows from an integration by
parts. By the concavity of u(·), the second period’s expected utility gain is always negative for
any m > 0, which reflects the cost due to the extra second-period consumption volatility when
participating in the Rosca, since both the allocation and the amount of the money pot are random
depending on the opponent’s first period income shock realization. The bigger the size, the higher
the volatility. The expected marginal cost from Rosca in the second period, at m close to 0, is zero:

Therefore, the ex ante welfare gain is positive for a Rosca with optimal size m∗ > 0 as Proposition
2 shows.

3.2

Case II: Rosca and a Perfect Formal Credit Market

Now we consider the other extreme case where Rosca participants can borrow and lend at an
interest r > 0 in a perfect formal credit market, and examine whether Rosca may still improve
participants’ welfare. We show that having access to a perfect formal credit market will crowd out
the role of Rosca.
3.2.1

Indirect Utility

First, we derive the indirect utility of a representative agent. With a perfect credit market
where the interest rates rb = rs = r, given the first period’s income y1 , a representative agent’s
problem is



y1 + ρY2 − c1

(14)
V (y1 ; r) ≡ max u(c1 ) + δEu
ρ
{c1 }
where ρ ≡ 1/ (1 + r).

9

The value function V (·; r) can be shown to be increasing and concave.12 Without participating
in a Rosca, the agent’s utility is given by
n
VII
(y1 ; r) = V (y1 ; r).

(15)

Note that under a perfect credit market, a Rosca with size m and winning bid bII (x), depending
on the winner’s realized shock x, is equivalent to a transfer (in net present value) of:
T (x) = ρ[mr − bII (x)]

(16)

from the loser to the winner. Therefore, the winner’s indirect utility is given by
w
VII
(bII (x); ȳ − x, r) = V (ȳ − x + T (x); r) ,

(17)

and the loser’s (random) indirect utility, depending on the winner’s income-shock X j , is given by
f
(bII (X j ); ȳ − x, r) = V (ȳ − x − T (X j ); r).
VII

(18)

In what follows, we use these indirect utilities to derive the bidding strategy and then evaluate the
social welfare.
3.2.2

An Impossibility Result

Using strategies similar to those in the derivation of expression (5), and plugging in indirect
w and V f as given by (17) and (18), we can derive the expected utility for agent 1 of

V (ȳ − x − T (xj ); r)dF (xj ), (19)
x̃

where the explanation of each term is similar to (5) and is thus omitted here. The first order
condition for optimal strategy must satisfy ∂∂x̃ UII (x, x̃; r) x̃=x = 0, thus we obtain
T 0 (x) = −

For x = 0, UII (0, 0; r) is similar to (7) with VIw and VIf replaced by VII
II
We can prove the following result regarding the social welfare in the presence of a perfect formal
credit market:
Proposition 3 If there is a perfect credit market, then Rosca cannot improve the ex ante welfare.
12

This is a special case of Lemma 1 in Section 4 where the formal statement and proof are provided.

10

Propositions 2 and 3 for the two benchmark cases help to identify the key properties of Rosca
that are important in understanding its interactions with formal credit markets. There are two
competing effects from having access to formal credit markets. On the positive side, having access
to formal financial markets can potentially improve individuals’ welfare over the immediate outcome
of the Rosca bidding. To see this, we note that, if access to a credit market is available, the loser of
the Rosca bidding could achieve a higher expected utility by utilizing the credit market, specifically,
she receives:

where the right hand side is the loser’s utility without access to the credit market. Similarly, the
winner could also be better off by utilizing the formal credit market in response to the Rosca
winning.
However, the above potential benefit changes the incentive structure because the presence of
formal credit opportunities invites incentives for arbitrage, making it more difficult to satisfy the
incentive compatibility constraint in Rosca bidding. Recall from (16) that Rosca is equivalent to
a transfer of first-period income from the loser to the winner, with the expected net transfer π(·)
given by

where in each case the first term is the expected in-transfer (conditional on her winning the auction)
and the second term is the expected out-transfer (conditional on her losing the auction). By Jensen’s
inequality, we know that for all x,
UII (x, x; r) ≤ V (ȳ − x + π(x); r),

(21)

where for type x > x, UII (x, x; r) is the interim utility defined as in (19), with x̃ replaced by x and
w and V f respectively.
for type x = 0, UII (0, 0; r) is similar to (7) with VIw and VIf replaced by VII
II
The interpretation is that the transfer mechanism underlying the Rosca is no better than just
giving an expected net transfer π(·) to the participant due to the concavity of V (·; r). Note that
the incentive compatibility also requires
UII (x, x; r) ≥ UII (x, x̄; r) = V (ȳ − x + T (x̄); r) ≥ V (ȳ − x; r),

(22)

since it is feasible for a bidder to submit the highest bid b(x̄) ≤ mr by which she can ensure herself
an interim utility no less than V (ȳ − x; r). Inequalities (21) and (22) imply that, for all x, we
must have V (ȳ − x + π(x); r) ≥ V (ȳ − x; r), which in turn implies that π(x) ≥ 0, for all x. The
conflicts then arise from the fact that the budget balance constraint Eπ(X) = 0 does not allow for
π(X) > 0 with a positive probability given π(·) is nonnegative. Therefore, the only possibility is
n (ȳ − X; r), which implies that there is no Rosca that is both
π(·) ≡ 0. Then EUII (X, X; r) ≤ EVII
incentive compatible and ex ante welfare improving, in contrast to Proposition 2 where Rosca is ex
ante beneficial.

Rosca with Imperfect Credit Market

In this section, we consider an imperfect formal credit market where the individuals are allowed
to borrow and save, but the borrowing interest rate rb is greater than the saving interest rate rs .
As described in Table 1 we refer to this as Case III.

4.1

The Case without Rosca

Without Rosca, the problem for a representative agent with income y1 is:

(23)

s.t. c1 + ρs C2 ≤ y1 + ρs Y2 ,

(24)

c1 + ρb C2 ≤ y1 + ρb Y2 ,

(25)

where ρs ≡ 1/ (1 + rs ) and ρb ≡ 1/ (1 + rb ) , and (24) and (25) are the budget constraints for a
saver and a borrower respectively.13

(iii) y1 − c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) is increasing in y1 .
Lemma 1 generalizes the standard result on the intertemporal consumption with linear budget
constraint. In particular, Part (iii) says that if an agent with income y1 is a borrower, then for an
agent with income less than y1 , she must borrow more. Also if an income-y1 agent is a saver, then
for an agent with income more than y1 , she must save more. As we will see below, Lemma 1 is
useful in terms of assessing the social welfare and delineating a Rosca participant’s role (saver or
borrower) in the presence of an imperfect credit market.

4.2

Rosca, Indirect Value Functions and the Interaction with an Imperfect
Credit Market

Now suppose that there is a Rosca with size m in addition to the access to an imperfect credit
market. The value of bidder 1 with income y1 from winning the auction to access the pot at the end
The two constraints (24) and (25) are equivalent to the constraint C2 ≤ Y2 + min{ y1ρ−c1 , y1ρ−c1 }. We write it
s
b
as two explicit constraints, (24) for a saver and (25) for a borrower, to facilitate the application of the Lagrangian
approach.

(27)

c1 + ρb C2 ≤ y1 + m + ρb (Y2 − m − b),

(28)

where in constraints (27) and (28), the first period’s income y1 + m reflects her access to the
additional amount m from winning the auction, and the second period’s income Y2 − m − b reflects
her paying additional premium b in excess of the normal Rosca payment m in the second period.
Similarly, the value of bidder 1 with income y1 from losing
the period
1 auction while her

opponent wins with a premium bid of b̂, denoted by VIII b̂; y1 , rb , rs , is the solution to the

c1 + ρb C2 ≤ y1 − m + ρb (Y2 + m + b̂)

(30)
(31)

where in constraints (30) and (31), the first period’s income y1 − m reflects the fact that bidder
1 has to contribute m to the pot because she loses the bidding, and the second period’s income
Y2 + m + b̂ shows that she gets back m and the promised premium of b̂ from her opponent in period
2.
We now discuss how losing or winning the money pot in the period-1 Rosca auction changes the
participant’s role of being a borrower or a saver in the credit market. Recall that c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ), introduced in Lemma 1, is the optimal consumption in period one without Rosca. And let c∗w
1 (y1 , b; rb , rs )
be the Rosca winner’s optimal consumption in period 1, when her income is y1 and the winning
bid is b, i.e., the solution to Problem (26); and let c∗f
1 (y1 , b̂; rb , rs ) be the counterpart of the loser
when her opponent’s winning bid is b̂, i.e., the solution to Problem (29). We have the following
important observations:

The intuition behind Lemma 2 can be stated as follows. Part (i) says that, for a saver in the
absence of the Rosca (which is implied by y1 − m ≥ c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs )), if she saves money in the credit
market, she receives a saving interest rate rs ; but if she contributes money through Rosca given
13

her opponent’s bid b̂ ∈ [mrs , mrb ], the implicit interest rate is higher than rs and thus she is better
off with the Rosca. Similarly, Part (ii) says that, for a borrower in the absence of Rosca (which is
implied by c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) ≥ m + y1 ), if she borrows money from the credit market, she would have to
pay a borrowing interest rate rb ; but if she can get the money through winning the Rosca bidding
with any bid b ∈ [mrs , mrb ], her implicit borrowing interest rate is lower and thus she is better off
with Rosca. Lemma 2 establishes a link between the agents’ roles in the credit market before and
after Rosca participation. We will use Lemma 2 to solve the Rosca bidding equilibrium when the
size of Rosca is properly chosen.

4.3

Bidding Equilibrium and Welfare Analysis

Now we characterize the bidding equilibrium of Rosca with size m. Similar to formula (4), the
expected utility for bidder 1 of type-x (x > x) from reporting type x̃ (x̃ > x) is given by:

The explanation of (32) is similar to (4). Using the distribution of X, we rewrite (32) as:

(34)

∂b

We should point out that equation (34) only specifies the necessary first-order condition. We
need some technical conditions to insure the global optimality of bIII (·) as characterized by (34).
First, we see from (34) that, to ensure that bIII (·) is monotonically increasing, any type-x agent
needs to be better off being a winner of in the period-1 Rosca bidding with a bid bIII (x) than
being a loser with the same bid from her opponent. To guarantee this, we need to impose some
restrictions on the size of the Rosca m, namely m can not be too large: if m is too large, it is
possible that the winner of the Rosca bidding ends being a saver, while the loser ends up being a
borrower, causing a violation of the monotonicity of bIII (·). It turns out that a sufficient condition
is that the Rosca size m > 0 is bounded above by m (rb , rs ) as given by:14
m ≤ m (rb , rs ) ≡ min{c∗1 (ȳ − x; rb , rs ) − (ȳ − x), ȳ − c∗1 (ȳ; rb , rs )}.
14

The existence of m̄ (rb , rs ) is in turn guaranteed by:
u0 (ȳ) < δ(1 + rs )Eu0 (Y2 ) and u0 (ȳ − x) > δ(1 + rb )Eu0 (Y2 ).

14

(35)

By Lemma 2, if m ≤ ȳ − c∗1 (ȳ; rb , rs ), then the type-0 bidder will not be a borrower regardless of her
wining or losing the auction; and if m ≤ c∗1 (ȳ − x; rb , rs ) − (ȳ − x), then the type-x bidder will not
be a saver regardless of her wining or losing the auction. Second, we also need a technical condition
that the utility function has weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion and u0000 (.) ≥ 0, where the
latter implies increasing absolute prudence.15
Lemma 3 Consider an imperfect credit market with borrowing and saving interest rate rb and rs
respectively, with 0 ≤ rs < rb . Suppose that u (·) has weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion and
that u0000 ≥ 0, and the size of Rosca m is bounded by m̄ (rb , rs ) as given by (35), then there exists a
bidding equilibrium in period-1 Rosca auction such that:
(i) bIII (0) = mrs ;
(ii) for type x > x, bIII (x) is characterized by the differential equation
b0III (x) =

(1 − p)f (x) V (ȳ − x + ρb (mrb − bIII (x); rb ) − V (ȳ − x − ρb (mrb − bIII (x)); rb )
, (36)
p + (1 − p)F (x)
ρb V 0 (ȳ − x + ρb (mrb − bIII (x)); rb )

with an initial condition bIII (x) = mrs , where V (·; r) is defined as in (14) and V 0 (y1 ; r)
denotes its derivative with respect to y1 .
If the equilibrium is characterized by Lemma 3, the welfare property is given by:
Proposition 4 Assume rb > rs ≥ 0 and that the conditions for Lemma 3 hold. Then under the
equilibrium bidding strategy specified in Lemma 3, Rosca improves participants’ ex ante welfare.
The key observation here is that the interest rate gap limits the agents’ arbitrage between Rosca
and the credit market. With the gap between the borrowing and saving interest rates, a saver will
be self-disciplined to submit a bid with an implied interest rate lower than the saving interest rate
in the credit market. In equilibrium, the borrower will realize that the saver will not bid higher
than the saving interest rate, and thus may submit a bid with an implied interest rate lower than
the borrowing interest rate. Since the bids are between the two credit market interest rates, both
saver and borrower are better off. In the Corollary 1 below, we explicitly characterize the bidding
equilibrium for the case of Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) utility functions:
Corollary 1 Under the CARA utility function u(c) = [1 − exp (−βc)] /β, the equilibrium bidding
function is given by:

Under the above condition, the agent with no income shock will be a saver, i.e., ȳ > c∗1 (ȳ; rb , rs ), and the agent with
the income shok x will be a borrower, i.e., c∗1 (ȳ − x; rb , rs ) > (ȳ − x).

In a seminal paper, Kimball (1990) shows that the intensity of saving also depends on the absolute prudence

Welfare Comparisons

In the previous sections, we have investigated the possibility for Rosca to improve the welfare,
under a variety of credit market conditions. Now we discuss the change of welfare when credit
market conditions improve. In the absence of Rosca, it is straightforward to show that, for any y1 ,
the following inequalities hold:

(39)
n

n
where VI (y1 ) is defined as in (1), VII (y1 ; r) is defined as in (15) and VIII (y1 ; rb , rs ) is defined as in
(23). We summarize the above inequalities by the following proposition:

Proposition 5 (Welfare and Credit Market Imperfectness in the Absence of Rosca) In
the absence of Rosca, a reduction in the credit market imperfectness, as measured by the borrowing/savings interest rate gap, increases the social welfare.
The next proposition addresses the following question: are agents better off in an environment
where they form a Rosca with size m, but do not have access to credit market, or in an environment
with a perfect formal credit market with interest rate r with no Rosca? The answer is affirmatively
the latter, if the interest rate r in the perfect credit market is not too high.
Proposition 6 (Perfect Credit Market without Rosca vs. Rosca without Credit Market)
R x̄
Assume p = 0. If the Rosca size m is such that x bI (x)dF (x)2 /m ≥ r, we have
n
EUI (X, X) ≤ EVII
(ȳ − X; r).

In particular,

R x̄
x

bI (x)dF (x)2 /m ≥ r holds if ρ = 1/(1 + r) ≥ δ.

The intuition for Proposition 6 is as follows. In a traditional society where there is no credit
market but a continuum of ex ante identical residents who are randomly paired to form Rosca with
R x̄
size m. The average winning bid in this economy is exactly x bI (x)dF (x)2 ,16 which results in an
R x̄
R x̄
average implied interest rate x bI (x)dF (x)2 /m. Under the stated condition that x bI (x)dF (x)2 /m
higher than the interest rate r prevalent in the perfect credit market, agents in the modern society
with perfect credit market will experience less volatile consumption as that in the traditional society
16

The average winning bid has a c.d.f. F (x)2 instead of F (x) because it is the highest order statistic of two random
variables.

R x̄
∗
x [ȳ − x − c1 (ȳ − x; r, r)]dF (x) = 0, then under Constant Absolute Risk Averse (CARA) utility
function, we indeed have ρ ≥ δ.
Finally, we consider traditional societies with the presence of traditional Rosca and a formal
credit market, and ask the following question: in the presence of Rosca, is the social welfare
monotonically increasing as the credit market imperfectness, as measured by rb − rs , converges to
zero? Interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, the answer is no, at least for CARA utility, as the
following proposition states:
Proposition 7 (Non-Monotonicity of Welfare with respect to Credit Market Imperfectness in the Presence of Rosca) Assume that the utility is CARA. For any fixed rb , when
the size of Rosca m ≤ minrs ∈[0,rb ] m (rb , rs ) where m (rb , rs ) is given by (38) satisfies

then for some rs < rb , we have
EUIII (X, X; rb , rs ) > EUIII (X, X; rb , rb ).

(41)

To illustrate Proposition 7, we provide a numerical example where the parameters that define
the environment are described in Table 2. We consider the changes in welfare when the saving
interest rate rs varies from 0 to rb = 0.27. We first verify that the conditions for Proposition 7 are
satisfied in the example. It can be shown that the type-0 agent will be a saver in period 1 regardless
of rs and her optimal period-1 saving, ȳ − c∗1 (ȳ; rb , rs ) where c∗1 (ȳ; rb , rs ) is give by (A18), is given

example, as rs approaches rb , EUIII (X, X; rb , ·) is not monotonically increasing. The reason is that
as rs → rb , it becomes more difficult to satisfy the incentive compatibility constraint in the Rosca
mechanism, which drives the bid up, and reduces welfare gain from Rosca. Moreover, the decrease
18

of welfare gain from Rosca will dominate the increase of welfare gain from the improvement of the
credit market. Finally, as rs = rb , we have shown that the perfect credit market will eliminate any
welfare gain from Rosca, EUIII (X, X; rb , rb ) = EV (ȳ − X, rb ). The non-monotonicity shows that
the perfectness of the credit market is not always desirable since it may inhibit the performance of
the self-insurance mechanism such as Rosca.
Moreover, it can be seen that inequality
h
i (40) is more likely to hold if the expected marginal
R x̄
β(1+rb )
disutility of income shocks x exp 2+rb x dF (x) is higher. Moreover, the fact that the right
hand side of (40) is inversely U -shaped in p indicates that for the non-monotonicity to occur, p
should not be too small or too large.

Conclusion

In this paper, we develop an auction model of risk averse Rosca participants facing income
shocks to investigate the interaction between the credit market and Rosca, which fills a hole in the
existing literature. We uncover two competing forces regarding the interaction between a Rosca
and a formal credit market. On the one hand, the formal credit market may facilitate (rather
than substitute) the participation of Rosca through the smoothing of the risk introduced by the
uncertainty in the Rosca bidding; on the other hand, the incentive compatibility constraint for
Rosca participants becomes more difficult to satisfy due to the arbitrage incentives resulting from
the access to the formal credit market.
Using the gap of the borrowing and saving interest rates as a measure of the imperfectness of the
credit market, we compare three cases: (i) Rosca without credit market; (ii) Rosca with a perfect
credit market; (iii) Rosca with an imperfect credit market. We show that a perfect credit market
completely crowds out the role of Rosca. However, when credit market is present but imperfect,
we show that Rosca and the formal credit market can complement each other in improving social
welfare. Interestingly, we find that the social welfare in an environment with both Rosca and formal
credit market does not necessarily increase monotonically as the imperfectness of the credit market
converges to zero.

Appendix: Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1:
Suppose that b0 ≥ 0 satisfies (8) and (9). We prove Proposition 1 in two steps.
(Step 1.) We show that any solution to Eq. (6) with boundary condition bI (0) = bI (x) = b0 satisfies
0
bI (·) > 0 and bI (·) ≥ 0.
First, we show that there exists some x∗ > x such that b0I (x) > 0 for x ∈ (x, x∗ ). Suppose not. There
must exist some ε > 0 such that b0I (x) ≤ 0 for any x ∈ (x, x + ε). Then, for x ∈ (x, x + ε) we have:
VIw (bI (x); ȳ−x)−VIf (bI (x); ȳ−x) > VIw (bI (x); ȳ−x)−VIf (bI (x); ȳ−x) ≥ VIw (bI (x); ȳ−x)−VIf (bI (x); ȳ−x) ≥ 0,
where the first inequality follows from the strict concavity of u(·); and the second inequality follows from
the fact that VIw (·; ȳ − x) decreases in b and VIf (·; ȳ − x) increases in b; and the last inequality follows from
the assumption that bI (x) = b0 satisfying inequality (9). Therefore, by Eq. (6), the above inequality in turn
implies b0I (x) > 0, a contradiction.
Next we show that b0I (·) > 0 for all x > x. Suppose not. Given that b0I (x) > 0 for x close to x as we have
shown, there must exist x∗ such that b0I (x∗ ) = 0, bI (x∗ + ε) < bI (x∗ ) and b0I (x∗ + ε) < 0 for some ε > 0. If
so, we have
VIw (bI (x∗ + ε); ȳ − (x∗ + ε)) − VIf (bI (x∗ + ε); ȳ − (x∗ + ε))
>

VIw (bI (x∗ ); ȳ − (x∗ + ε)) − VIf (bI (x∗ ); ȳ − (x∗ + ε))

>

VIw (bI (x∗ ); ȳ − x∗ ) − VIf (bI (x∗ ); ȳ − x∗ ) = 0,

where the first inequality follows from the fact that VIw (·; ȳ − x) − VIf (·; ȳ − x) decreases in b; the second
inequality follows from the strict concavity of u(·); and the last equality follows from the hypothesis that
b0I (x∗ ) = 0 (through Eq. (6)). Therefore, by Eq. (6) again, the above inequality implies that b0I (x∗ + ε) > 0,
a contradiction. Thus, for all x > x, b0I (·) > 0 and bI (·) ≥ 0.
(Step 2.) We show that bI (·) that solves Eq. (6) with boundary condition bI (0) = bI (x) = b0 is a
symmetric BNE of the Rosca bidding game.
First, we show that there is no incentive for type x > x to mimic any x̃ 6= x such that x̃ > x. Note that
expression (4) and the concavity of u (·) imply that:
∂ 2 UI (x, x̃)
= (1 − p)f (x̃)[u0 (ȳ − x − m) − u0 (ȳ − x + m)] ≥ 0.
∂ x̃∂x

(A1)

Together with the first order condition that ∂UI (x, τ )/∂τ |τ =x = 0, (A1) implies that, for any x, x̃ > x,
Z x
∂UI (x, τ )
UI (x, x) − UI (x, x̃) =
dτ ≥ 0.
(A2)
∂τ
x̃
Therefore, there is no incentive for any type x > x to mimic any x̃ 6= x such that x̃ > x.
We next show that there is no incentive for type x > x to mimic type 0. Since bI (0) = bI (x) = b0 , if a
type-x bidder were to mimic type-0 agent and bid b0 , her gain from the deviation is:
UI (x, 0) − UI (x, x) ≤ UI (x, 0) − UI (x, x) =

p[V f (bI (x); ȳ − x) − VIw (bI (x); ȳ − x)] ≤ 0,
2 I

where the first inequality is due to UI (x, x) ≥ UI (x, x), which follows from (A2); the equality simply uses the
definition of UI (x, 0) and UI (x, x); and the third step uses bI (x) ≤ bI (x) and that VIw (·; ȳ − x)−VIf (·; ȳ − x)
decreases in b.
Lastly, we use condition (8) to show that there is no incentive for type-0 agent to deviate from bidding
bI (0) = b0 . Note that any type x > x will bid higher than bI (x) = b0 because b0I (·) > 0. Given the opponent’s
equilibrium bidding strategy bI (·), a type-0 bidder’s expected gain of deviation is:
UI (x, 0) − UI (0, 0)

where the first inequality follows from the fact that VIw (·; ȳ) decreases in b and VIf (·; ȳ) increases in b; and
the second inequality follows from the assumption that b0 satisfies inequality (8). Thus, type-0 bidder have
no incentive to mimic x ∈ (x, x̄].
Proof of Proposition 2:
We first prove that, under the stated condition that δ ∈ (0, u0 (ȳ)/Eu0 (Y2 )), the bidding equilibrium
as characterized by Proposition 1 exists when m is sufficiently small. To see this, note that, if δ ∈
(0, u0 (ȳ)/Eu0 (Y2 )) , then

(0; ȳ) > VIf (0; ȳ). Since VIw (·; ȳ) − VIf (·; ȳ) is continuous
Thus, for sufficiently small m > 0, we have
and decreasing in b, there exists some b0 > 0 such that VIw (b0 ; ȳ) = VIf (b0 ; ȳ) , which satisfies condition
(8). Further, note that VIw (b0 ; ȳ − x) − VIf (b0 ; ȳ − x) is increasing in x, VIw (b0 ; ȳ) = VIf (b0 ; ȳ) implies
VIw (b0 ; ȳ − x) ≥ VIf (b0 ; ȳ − x) since x ≥ 0. Thus, b0 also satisfies condition (9). Therefore, Proposition 1
applies and a bidding equilibrium as characterized by Proposition 1 exists.
Now, the ex ante expected utility from participating in Rosca with size m conditional on x ≥ x,

Proof of Proposition 3:

Proof of Lemma 1:
Using the Lagrangian method (see Luenberger, 1969) for concave functional Eu(·), we can

where
LnIII (c1 , C2 ; λb , λs ; y1 , Y2 ) = u(c1 )+δE {u(C2 ) + λb [y1 − c1 + ρb (Y2 − C2 )] + λs [y1 − c1 + ρs (Y2 − C2 )]}
(A8)
is the Lagrangian functional and λb ≥ 0 and λs are respectively the Lagrangian multiplier for
constraints (25) and (24).18 Because u(·) is concave, and the constraint is linear in the control
variables, both the solution and the multiplier are unique. The first-order conditions are given by:
u0 (c1 ) = λs + λb and δEu0 (C2 ) = ρs λs + ρb λb .

(A9)

(i) Given that LnIII (c1 , C2 ; λb , λs ; y1 , Y2 ) is continuous and differentiable in each argument
and concave in (c1 , C2 ), by a generalized envelope theorem (e.g., Milgrom and Segal, 2002),

Since we have shown in (i) that V (·; rb , rs ) is concave, it follows that u0 (c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs )) is decreasing
in y. Thus, c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) is increasing in y1 .
(iii) First consider the case c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) > y1 , i.e. when the agent is a borrower in the first
period. This implies that λs = 0. From the first order condition (A9), we have

The complementarity slackness condition applies, i.e., λk = 0, k = b, s, if the corresponding constraint is slack.

y1 − c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) is increasing in y1 .

where the first inequality follows from the supposition c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) ≤ y1 − m < c∗f

the second inequality follows from ρs > ρb and y1 − m < c1 (y1 , mrs ; rb , rs ); the third inequality

condition for a saver with income y1 and the definition of c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ). This is a contraction. Thus,
c∗f
1 (y1 , mrs ; rb , rs ) ≤ y1 − m.
We next show that y1 − m ≥ c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) implies that c∗f
1 (y1 , b̂; rb , rs ) ≤ y1 − m for any b̂ ∈
(mrs , mrb ]. As we have shown above, when b̂ = mrs the loser of the period-one Rosca bidding will

the contrary that c1 (y1 , b̂; rb , rs ) > y1 − m. This implies that λ∗s = 0 at the optimal solution for
problem (A11). Thus, we have:
LfIII (c∗1 , C2∗ ; λ∗b , λ∗s ; y1 − m, Y2 + m + b̂) = LfIII (c∗1 , C2∗ ; λ∗b , λ∗s ; y1 , Y2 ) − λ∗b ρb (mrb − b̂)

Proof of Lemma 3:
(Step 1.) We show that, under the restriction on Rosca size m ≤ m (rb , rs ) , any agent with
type x > x will be a borrower, regardless of winning or losing the period-one Rosca bidding.
Note that the size restriction on m implies that 0 < m ≤ c∗1 (ȳ − x; rb , rs ) − (ȳ − x), which in
turn, by Part (iii) of Lemma 1, implies m ≤ c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) − y1 for any y1 < ȳ − x.

That the winner of the period-one Rosca bidding will remain a borrower follows from Part (ii)
of Lemma 2, which states that m + y1 ≤ c∗1 (y1 ; rb , rs ) implies c∗w

b ∈ [mrs , mrb ].
We now show that the loser of the period-one Rosca bidding will also be a borrower. Suppose

argument as in the proof of Proposition 1, it suffices to show ∂ 2 UIII (x, x̃; rb , rs ) /∂x∂ x̃ ≥ 0. For

taking derivatives with respect to x and x̃, we have:

decreasing absolute risk aversion and u0000 ≥ 0 are sufficient to ensure that ∂ 2 UIII (x, x̃; rb , rs ) /∂x∂ x̃ ≥
0.19
(Step 3.) We show that the incentive compatibility for type-0 agent is satisfied in the postulated
equilibrium.
Lemma 2 shows that m ≤ ȳ − c∗1 (ȳ; rb , rs ) implies that c∗f
1 (ȳ, b̂; rb , rs ) ≤ ȳ − m for any b̂ ∈
f
n
w
[mrs , mrb ] and that VIII (b̂; ȳ, rb , rs ) ≥ VIII (ȳ; rb , rs ) ≥ VIII (b̂; ȳ, rb , rs ). Therefore, type-0 bidder is
a saver regardless of winning or losing the period-one Rosca bidding and it does not have strict
incentives to deviate to bid any b̃ > mrs = bIII (x).
Proof of Proposition 4:
We showed in the Proof of Lemma 3 that the size restriction on m ≤ m ≡ min{c∗1 (ȳ − x) − (ȳ −
x), ȳ − c∗1 (ȳ; rb , rs )} implies that, regardless of winning or losing the period-one Rosca bidding, the
bidder will be a saver if x = 0 and a borrower if x > x. We have, for type-0 agent,

For agents with type-x > x, we have:

(A17)

where the first step follows from the incentive compatibility constraint that type-x bidder does not
have strict incentive to pretend as type-x̄; the second step follows from the fact that type−x̄ agent
will always win the period-one Rosca bidding because b0III > 0; the third step follows from the fact

that type-x̄ agent will be a borrower despite winning the Rosa bidding; the fourth step uses the
fact that bIII (x̄) ≤ mrb ; and the last step follows from the fact that type-x̄ agent is a borrower in
the absence of Rosca.
Inequalities (A16) and (A17) show that under the equilibrium bidding strategy specified in
Lemma 3, agents of all types are interim individually rational. The ex ante welfare gain EUIII (X, X; rb , rs )

β(2 + r)

(A18)

where K ≡ Eexp (−βY2 ) is a constant that equals to the expected marginal utility of period-2’s

With the following change of variables:

(A22)

we can re-write the differential equation (A21) as:
h0 (x) =

p + (1 − p)F (x)

The above differential equation has a general solution:

We can then solve bIII (x) from (A24) to obtain (37). The necessary size restriction m̄ for this
example follows immediately from c∗1 (·) . We verify the sufficiency of the first order condition for
the bidding equilibrium in the supplemental appendix.20

Now consider the term ϕ(m) as defined in (A34). Note that ϕ(0) = EVIn (ȳ − X); and recall
from Proposition 2 that d∆W I (m)/dm m=0 > 0, which implies that ϕ(ε) > ϕ(0) for a small ε > 0.
However, we have the following two observations:

Supplemental Appendix

B.1

Verifying the Sufficiency of the First Order Condition in Lemma 3

In this supplemental appendix, we show that the technical assumptions in Lemma 3 guarantees
the sufficiency of the first order condition. It suffices to show the following lemma:
Lemma B1 Assume that −u00 (·)/u0 (·) is weakly decreasing and u0000 ≥ 0, then ∂ 2 UIII (x, x̃; rb , rs )/∂ x̃∂x ≥
0 for any x > x and x̃ > x.
Substituting (A14) into (33), and taking derivatives with respect to x and x̃, we have:
"
#
V 0 (y1 − TIII (x̃); rb ) − V 0 (y1 + TIII (x̃); rb )
∂ 2 UIII (x, x̃; rb , rs )
= (1 − p)f (x̃)
,
(x̃);rb )−V (ỹ1 −TIII (x̃);rb )
∂ x̃∂x
+V 00 (y1 + TIII (x̃); rb ) V (ỹ1 +TIII
V 0 (ỹ1 +TIII (x̃);rb )
where y1 = y − x, ỹ1 = ȳ − x̃; V 0 and V 00 respectively denote the first and second order derivative
with respect to y1 . For convenience, we also suppress argument rb in the value function V (y; rb ),
so V (·) is a shortcut for V (·; rb ). To show ∂ 2 UIII (x, x̃; rb , rs )/∂ x̃∂x ≥ 0, it suffices to show
V 0 (y1 − TIII (x̃)) − V 0 (y1 + TIII (x̃)) + V 00 (y1 + TIII (x̃))

V (ỹ1 + TIII (x̃)) −V (ỹ1 − TIII (x̃))
≥ 0,
V 0 (ỹ1 + TIII (x̃))

which can be rewritten as
V 0 (y1 − TIII (x̃)) − V 0 (y1 + TIII (x̃)) V (ỹ1 + TIII (x̃)) − V (ỹ1 − TIII (x̃))
+
≤ 0,
V 00 (y1 + TIII (x̃))
V 0 (ỹ1 + TIII (x̃))

(B1)

since V 00 (y1 + TIII (x̃)) ≤ 0 by the concavity of V (·).
We show inequality (B1) in two steps: first, we show a sufficient condition based on the properties of V (·); second, we show that under the stated conditions for the lemma, the sufficient
condition in the first step is satisfied.
00 (·)
and −V 000 (·) are weakly decreasing.
Step 1. We show that (B1) holds if − VV 0 (·)
00

(·)
Note that if − VV 0 (·)
is weakly decreasing, then V 000 (·) ≥ 0; hence V 0 (·) is convex. We thus have

which implies that

that V 00 (·) < 0, we have

−
≤ 0.
V 0 (ỹ1 + TIII (x̃)) V 00 (y1 + TIII (x̃))

(B4)

Consider the left hand side of inequality (B4). It can be show by simple algebra that the first

V 00 (·)
1 −TIII (x̃))
term VV 0 (ỹ
(ỹ1 +TIII (x̃)) is decreasing in ỹ1 due to the assumption that − V 0 (·) is weakly decreasing; and
00

(y1 −TIII (x̃))
(·)
the second term − VV 00 (y
is decreasing in y1 if − VV 00 (·)
is increasing, which follows from the

stated assumption that −V is weakly decreasing (i.e. V ≥ 0).
0
1 −TIII (x̃))
We now prove inequality (B4). Consider two possible cases. (i). If ỹ1 ≥ y1 , we have VV 0 (ỹ
(ỹ1 +TIII (x̃)) ≤
V 0 (y1 −TIII (x̃))
V 0 (y1 +TIII (x̃)) ;

hence

(·)

where the last inequality holds because − VV 0 (·)

1 +TIII (x̃))

show that V 000 V 0 −V 002 ≥ 0. Note that the first order condition for optimal consumption in Problem

Verification of Global Optimality for the CARA Case in Corollary 1

To show the global optimality of the bidding function (37) for any x > x, it suffices to check that
condition (B1) is satisfied. Recall from (A19), V (·; r) is exponential for the CARA case. Hence,
for any y1 , ỹ1 , and TIII (x) = ρb (mrb − bIII (x)), we have
V 0 (y1 − TIII (x̃); rb ) − V 0 (y1 + TIII (x̃); rb )
V 00 (y1 + TIII (x̃); rb )

Therefore, condition (B1) is satisfied by
V 0 (y1 − TIII (x̃); rb ) − V 0 (y1 + TIII (x̃); rb ) V (ỹ1 + TIII (x̃); rb ) − V (ỹ1 − TIII (x̃); rb )
+
= 0.
V 00 (y1 + TIII (x̃); rb )
V 0 (ỹ1 + TIII (x̃); rb )
Finally, for type-0 bidder, bIII (0) = mrs , as we have shown in Lemma 3.
