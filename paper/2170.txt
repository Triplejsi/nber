Alternative Compensation Arrangements and Productive Efficiency in Partnerships:
Evdence From Medical Group Practice

ABSTRACT

Although the role of the services sector in the economy has grown
increasingly large, and partnerships are a prevalent form of organization in
this sector, relatively little is known about the behavior and performance of

these firms. In this paper an attempt is made to fill that gap by developing
and testing a model of the effect of alternative compensation arrangements on

productive efficiency in medical group practices. The technique employed is
two—stage production frontier estimation. This technique provides direct
estimates of productive efficiency and allows for differences across agents in
ability or responsiveness to financial incentives. In the frontier literature
productive efficiency is assumed to be exogenously given.

In this paper it is

determined endogenously, thus a simple econometric technique correcting for
this endogeneity in estimating the production frontier is employed.

In

addition, the measures of efficiency themselves can be made dependent
variables for explicit econometric analysis of the determinants of efficiency.
Overall, the empirical results are consistent with theoretical work on

which

predicts that productivity compensation
schemes will work well for firms with non-joint production and observable
output. These two criteria are met by medical group practices. The treatment
internal theory of the firm,

of measured efficiency as an endogenous variable is unique and allows some
interesting insights into the determinants of productive efficiency.

We find

that relating compensation to productivity does increase the quantity and
efficiency of production, as theory has hypothesized. The number of members
in a group decreases both the quantity produced and the efficiency with which
that output is produced. Experience does lead to greater productivity and

efficiency. Medical groups in general are measured as being no less efficient
than an average manufacturing firm, but Health Maintenance Organizations are
less efficient than average.

Although the role of the services sector in the economy has grown
increasingly large, and partnerships are a prevalent form of organization in
this sector, relatively little is known

about

the behavior and performance of

these firms. In this paper an attempt is made to fill that gap by developing
and testing a model of the effect of alternative compensation arrangements on

productive efficiency in medical group practices. In addition, some
comparisons of efficiency with manufacturing sectors are made.

There is a vast theoretical literature on compensation, organizational
form and efficiency in firms, but the empirical literature is comparatively

sparse. The basic theoretical results are that productivity based
compensation arrangements are best when production is non-joint across

agents. Jointness in production calls for some kind of sharing of revenues,
costs, or profits, plus monitoring where observability is possible. If
observability is impossible, bonus—penalty schemes work best.
Some empirical evidence on this matter has been provided by the
literature on the economics of medical group practices and legal group

practices. For medical practice )Jewhouse (1973) provided solid evidence of
"behavioral diseconomies of scale", or shirking under equal sharing

arrangements as size increases. Held, Pauly, and Reinhardt (1978), using a
more comprehensive data set, estimated a production function which examined
the effect of compensation arrangements. They found evidence that
productivity—based compensation arrangements do lead to greater productivity.
Similar evidence on legal practice is represented by Leibowitz and Tollison

(1980). Both of these studies do show "shirking" present under equal—sharing,
non—productivity based compensation arrangements.
The work in this paper differs from these prior studies in both focus

and technique. The intent of this research is to uncover the determinants of

productive efficiency in medical partnerships. The technique employed is
two—stage production frontier estimation. This technique allows for
differences across agents in ability or responsiveness to financial

incentives. In the frontier literature productive efficiency is assumed to be
exogenously given. In this paper efficiency is determined

endogenously, and a simple econometric technique to take this endogeneity into

account in estimating the production frontier. In addition, the measures of
efficiency themselves can be made dependent variables for explicit econometric

analysis of the determinants of efficiency. The paper is organized as

follows: Section 2.0 contains the theoretical model, in 3.0 the econometric
methodology is presented, there is a discussion of the data in section 4.0,
5.0 contains estimation results, and 6.0 has the summary and conclusions.

2.0

THE MODEL

In this model the partners are utility maximizing agents who make
decisions over "effort" in response to the incentives present in the firm's

compensation method) The compensation structure is treated as fixed by any
partner, although it is endogenous as far as the group as a whole is

concerned. Effort is defined as a variable input supplied by a partner which
determines his efficiency of production. In order to highlight the efficiency
aspects of production, all other inputs are assumed to be chosen at the firm
2
level.

Production is described by the production function:

This model draws on that contained in Gaynor (1986).
2Some empirical support for this assumption is provided by the fact that in
the data sample employed in this study, less than 35% of physicians indicated
that they set their own hours.
3

Output is assumed homogeneous. Although output may truly be heterogeneous,
and compensation structure will affect the quality of service (as shown in
Gaynor; 1986), the incentives for efficiency in production are unchanged by
heterogeneity of the product.

Given h., t., k. chosen by the firm and 0. is exogenous, the partner's

choice

of effort determines the quantity produced. This choice maximizes his

or her utility, and utility in turn depends directly on the net income the
physician

receives and inversely on the level of effort and hours applied.

The second order condition (not shown) also holds, given the assumptions made

Equation (4) can

be

readily interpreted as

indicating that the utility maximizing level of effort is where the marginal
net income product of effort (the first term in (4)) is equal to its marginal

utility cost (the second term in (4)). Figure 1 illustrates this. In A.,
utility is maximized at the tangency (point E) between an indifference curve,

uu, and the effort—income locus, YY. In B., this is represented by the point
(E) where the marginal net income product of effort curve and marginal utility
cost of effort curve cross.

Examining the comparative static derivatives for the equilibrium shows

the effects of changes in a, P. n or C on the optimal choice of e,. Table 1

of these variables on curve YT in Figure l.A or curves II and

contains the results. These. can

CC in Figure 1.B.

It is clear from these results that a partner will be responsive to
changes in the compensation structure and other variables set by the firm.

The effect of an increase in a is to increase productivity, or measured
efficiency, given measured levels of all inputs, because the increase will
call forth higher levels of the unmeasured input effort, e.,.

4This form is highly simplified; real world compensation structures often have
different shares for revenue and cost, and non—physician average cost is not
necessarily constant.

Given the impossibility of measuring effort, an estimate of the

production function will require attention both to the shape of the frontier
and the impact of the compensation structure on the distance between actual
output and the frontier.

Usingthe frontier technique for estimating the production function will
provide direct evidence of the effect of compensation structure on the

measured efficiency of production. Using the frontier technique controls for
the possibility that partners have differences in efficiency, ability, and

degree of responsiveness to financial incentives. These are unmeasured
attributes contained in the 0. vector.

In

1

this paper we will analyze measured productivity by using both

endogenous right side variables and a frontier function technique. Correct
treatment of the error term in a regression equation requires that these
approaches be combined.

To see why this is so, note that a conventional OLS regression line can

suffer from two kinds of problems: there may be simultaneous equations bias,
and the line through the central tendency of the data may not describe the

experience of the most efficient producers. Simultaneous equations bias will
arise if agents differ in their responsiveness to incentives and they can

choose their level of incentives. Frontier functions are appropriate if
agents differ in their ability to produce, given the incentives they face.
Since agents in the real would probably differ in both willingness and
ability, we need to take account of both influences.
Suppose initially that all agents have equal ability, in the sense that,
with a given level of effort and with given levels of all other inputs, equal

outputs will be observed. However, since the level of effort is not directly
observable, measured productivity can still differ. Suppose also that agents
differ in their responsiveness to financial incentives, that is, in their

willingness to trade off effort for financial reward. When faced with
payments that fully correspond to the revenue for their services ( = 1), all
agents are equally productive; as a falls below unity, productivity falls,

but at different rates for different agents. Figure 2 shows several possible
"incentive-productivity" curves; the dashed line plots the curve for an
individual of average responsiveness.

Since reducing a below unity reduces productivity, why would any firm
choose a value less than one? One may conjecture that, for risk averse
individuals facing a situation in which actual productivity is affected by
random events, some implicit insurance may be chosen. Having sicker patients
come to one's office may reduce productivity, but receiving part of one's
office may reduce productivity, but receiving part of one's compensation as a
salary guards against this risk.

If individuals have similar attitudes toward risk, one would then expect
the level of a chosen to be inversely related to the degree of responsiveness

to financial incentives. Actual observations might cluster as the "x's" in
Figure 2, and the estimated a would be indicated by the slope of the line
SE', which does not even have the same sign as any of the true values of a.

The solution to this problem is to find identifying variables, and treat
a as endogenous. Our data set does contain a number of such variables.
The other influence on productivity is the ability of the individual

agent. Figure 3 illustrates this point in a situation in which all partners
are of equal responsiveness to incentives, but of two levels of ability. (In
order to observe variation in a, we will need to assume that some other
determinant of the desired level of a, e.g., risk aversion, varies across

individuals.) The able partners always produce more output at all levels of

a (A, A1). The unable partners produce less (U. U1). Standard regression
techniques will result in the estimated function represented by the dotted

line SS. Frontier estimation will compare actual output with the best

practice frontier, FF. Clearly frontier estimation deals more effectively
with the problem of unobserved abilities than does standard regression
analysis.

This approach has a further implication for the relationship between
deviations of observed, from best practice, output and the level of a. Note
that, in Figure 1, the incentive productivity curves are closer together at

high a than at lower levels of a. If there are some reasons why a might
vary at a given level of incentive responsiveness (e.g., variation in degree
of risk aversion), then one might observe people with different levels of

responsiveness as indicated by the x's and the z's in Figure 4. But note that
the deviation between the best practice frontier and the actual values is much
smaller for the x's (high a) than it is for the z's (low a).

METHODOLOGY

The literature

on production frontiers and comparative efficiency (see

Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt (1977), Forsund et al., (1980) and Greene (1980)),
indicates that technical, or productive efficiency can be estimated via

econometric techniques as a means of comparing actual output to that which
would result from a "best practice" frontier which corresponds to the most

efficient set of observations. This implies:

q =

f(h,

t, k)u
1 1
1

(5)

where u. is a multiplicative error team representing efficiency, i.e.,

q
___
1.

=

U

1

f( )

Since in the conventional treatment the production function f represents
the frontier along which decisions are efficient, the error term must be

constrained to be nonnegative. Much of the literature on frontier estimation
examines maximum likelihood estimation of functions like (5), perhaps with the

addition of a two—sided error term to represent truly random deviations.5
Greene (1980), Richmond (1970). and Forsund et al., (1980), have shown that a
"corrected ordinary least squares" technique, or "COLS" can be used to

estimate consistent and unbiased estimates of the frontier. This technique
involves estimating the production function by OLS and then changing the
constant term until all the regression residuals are non—negative.

The production function to be estimated is of form

5Estimation of productive efficiency without the two—sided error term
introduces a downward bias, if any, into efficiency estimates. This is
because with only the single, one—sided error, no observations are allowed
above the frontier.

upward biased estimator of c. Greene (1980) points out that the bias can
be removed from the intercept, and thus the efficiency, estimators by simply
changing the value of the intercept until no residuals are positive. This
procedure is employed in this study.

In addition to the c measure of productive efficiency derived from
Greene (1980) and Richmond (1974), we employ an efficiency measure suggested

by Cavin and Stafford (1985). This is a measure of relative efficiency,
indicating the mean difference within each firm beteen actual performance and
the best practice point, standardized by the range of the regression
residuals, so that the efficiency measure is within the range

As noted earlier, the compensation structure of the firm will affect
both the shape of the production frontier and the estimated distance between

actual output and the frontier. That is, what is relevant is the difference
between the best practice output and the actual output, conditional on the

level of incentives for efficiency. Thus, OLS estimates of the production
function will be both biased and inconsistent. This problem can be remedied
by using two—stage least squares estimation techniques. The correct residual
to use as a base for measures of efficiency is calculated using the
second—stage parameter estimates and the actual variable values for endogenous
right side variables, not those calculated using instruments,

where the f3's and y's are estimates from the second—stage equation. This

4.0 DATA

The data utilized for this study were assembled by Mathematica Policy
Research, Inc., under contract to the National Center for Health Services

Research, Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Government. The bulk
of the data set is composed of surveys conducted by Matheniatica, although some

secondary data sources have been merged in. During the period March to June

— 15 —

1119P/O1].a

of 1978, fathematica conducted a nationwide survey of medical group

practices. The final sample included 957 groups and 6353 physicians

practicing in those groups. The sample was stratified by: group size, type
of group (multispecialty or single specialty), physician specialty, and
prepaid vs. fee—for—service. Large group practices were oversampled in an
ef fort to supply a reasonable number of observations, and a census was taken

of pre-paid groups, for the same purpose. Further, only five medical practice
specialities were sampled: general practice, internal medicine, pediatrics,

enera1 surgery, and obsterics/gynecology. Approximately 60 percent of all
office-based physicians practice in these specialities.

Since surveys tend to produce low response rates, Mathematica conducted

for nonresponse bias on their data. Examining each of the survey
instruments and using statistical techniques (e.g., the Heckman Technique)

analysis

Mathematica concluded that nonresponse
the

utilization of

bias was not a problem to be faced in

the data set for purposes of statistical analysis.

data set also includes data measuring characterisitcs of the area
in which the group practiced and data on the hospital with which the group is
affliated. The data on area characteristics were obtained from many sources,
This

including the American Medical Association, The County and City Data Book, and

various other sources. For a full listing of all these data sources see
Boldin, Carcagno, Held, Jamieson, and Woolridge (1979). The hospital data
were obtained from the American Hospital Association Guide for 1978.

This data set is currently the most complete and comprehensive of its
kind in the U.S., and as such is appropriate for the empirical analysis
conducted in this paper.

ESTIMATIOU RESULTS

A number of different empirical procedures are employed to examine the

determinants of productive efficiency. The production frontier is estimated
using the two—stage procedure described previously. This provides estimates
of the parameters of the production function and allows the efficiency
measures, c and r, to be calculated. Two methods are used to uncover the

determinants of efficiency. One, the sample is split between productivity

— 16 —

Ill 9P/Ol 1 a

related and unrelated compensation structures and production frontiers

estimated on each subsample. Theory predicts that the estimated efficency of
production should be higher for the productivity related compensation

structure subsample. Two, the measure of productive efficiency can be made a
dependent variable and regressed against its hypothesized determinants. As
indicated before, this is possible due to the fact that a single error term

frontier model is employed in this study. Finally, a test for efficient
employment of labor is presented. Table 2 presents the acronyms and
definitions for the variables employed in estimating the production frontier.
Table 3 has the means and standard errors of those variables.

Three of the independent variables, INCOPROD, LNGRPSIZ, and HMO, are

likely endogenous. The physician will have an effect on which values of these
variables he is associated with in two ways: his part in decision—making
within the group, and his choice of which group to join. The physician
preference variables, e.g., I1'fPRODY. PREFSIZ, are hypothesized to affect the

values of INCOPROD, LMGRPSIZ, and lIMO. Thus, the system is estimated via
two—stage least squares.

The first—stage estimates are presented in Table 5. Table 4 shows the
second stage estimates of the production function. The signs on the

second—stage coefficients are generally as expected. One exception is LMEXRM,
which is insignificant;. It may be that the number of examining rooms per
M.D. functions as a poor proxy for the flow of capital services. The other
inputs, physician time, (LNOHRSF), aide time (HRSNON), and administrators'
time (HRSADIf) all have positive and significant coefficients. Experience has
a positive but diminishing effect, consistent with greater experience leading

to greater productivity, but being counteracted by increasing age. The
coefficient for group size is negative and significant. This is consistent
with increasing group size leading to diminution of efficiency incentives, as
hypothesized.

The compensation structure variable, IIICOPROD, is positive and signif i—

cant, as hypothesized. An increasingly strong link between compensation and
productivity does lead to more office visits per week being produced. This is
the finding of Held, Pauly, and Reinhardt (1978). This is as hypothesized for
a firm with non—joint production, where output can be observed. Whether or
not the group is multispecialty or an lIMO seems to have little effect on out—

put. It is possible, however, that those two variables are highly collinear.

The first—stage estimations contain some interesting results

The

physician preference variables tended to have the signs intuition would

suggest. Physicians with a preference for hard work or productivity—related
rewards should locate in groups with high INCOPROD, or lead groups to adopt a

high INCOPEOD. That is what the empirical results indicate. IMPREGY, the
lack of alleged importance of regular income, was positively related to
INCOPROD, indicating that the less important is regular income to a physician,
the more strongly related to productivity will his group's compensation
structure be. When the dependent variable is lIMO, the sign of IMPREGY is the
opposite, indicating that as importance of regular income declines, it is less
likely a doctor will be in an lIMO.

IMPRODY, the lack of alleged importance of

productivity related to income, is negatively related to IJICOPROD. (Here
"importance" is interpreted as the physician's subjective feelings about the

propriety of relating income to productivity.) This indicates that the less
important is productivity related to income, the weaker will be the relation
between income and productivity. As preferred group size rises (PREFSIZ), so
does group size and the probability of being in an HIfO. The variable OWNRESP,
which increases with the physician's responsiveness to financial incentives,
had no statistically significant effect on any of the dependent variables.
Board certification status, thought to be a proxy for physician ability, was
also uniformly insignificant.

We examine efficiency, given the compensation method, by stratifying the
sample by values of INCOPROD and comparing the efficiency estimates across

subsamples. The variable INCOPROD contains the response to a survey question
asking how closely income is related to productivity in the group. It is
specified to take a value of one when there is no relationship, and ten when
the relationship is perfect. Due to the nature of the question responses with
values in the range two to nine are difficult to interpret. We therefore
split the sample by high (6-10) and low (1—5) values of INCOPROD.7 The
estimates of the two measures of efficiency, c and r, are contained in Table

6. The values of both c end r are significantly higher for the high INCOPROD
subsample than for the low INCOPROD subsample. In both cases the difference
in efficiency measures across subsamples is approximately equal to .05.

7A Chow test shows a significant difference at the 5% level between estimates
of the production function stratified in this way.

Table 7 reports the values of c and r for the sample stratified into 3

groups, [1,31. [4,71, [8, 10). Both efficiency measures rise with IPICOPEOD.
Overall, efficiency does appear to rise with I)JCOPROD, supporting the

hypothesis of this paper. Plot only does a productivity based compensation
structure lead to a greater level of production, it leads to more efficient
production.
It is interesting to compare these estimates of efficiency against those

obtained for manufacturing. Richmond (1974) obtained a mean efficiency

measure (c) for manufacturing of 0.869. Given that the services sector, and
particularly medical practice, is often alleged to be grossly inefficient
relative to the manufacturing sector, it is interesting that the efficiency
estimates obtained here compare favorably with one obtained for

manufacturing. This gives reason to doubt whether production of physician
services is any less efficient than production in the industrial sector of the
economy.

In order to examine the effect of compensation method on productive
efficiency in a more systematic way, we regressed one of the efficiency
measures, c, on some hypothesized determinants. These are the exogenous
characteristics of the medical groups, such as compensation structure or group
size. Table 9 presents the results. ALPHA is a dummy variable taking value
one when INCOPEOD is greater than 5, and zero otherwise.

ALPHA2 is one when

IPlCOPROD equals ten and zero when IPICOPROD equals one. The results support
the hypotheses that productive efficiency increases as compensation is related

to productivity, since both ALPHA and ALPHA2 turn up positive and significant

in all the specifications. The coefficient for CRPSIZ is negative and
significant, supporting the hypostheses that diminished productivity

incentives as group size rises leads to a loss of efficiency. Physician

experience, EXPER, is seen to increase measured efficiency. Efficiency is
lower in 1*50's, as has been alleged in some quarters. This may be due to lack
of productivity incentives in the compensation structure, larger group sizes
associated with Hi?40's, or the removal of physicians from the decision—making

process in HifO's. Interestingly enough, the coefficient for multispecialty
groups is positive and significant. Multispecialty groups may save their

member physicians the costs associated with lumpy demand, including slack time

and time spent drumming up patients, mainly via referrals. The system of
internal referrals in multispecialty groups may decrease physician slack time
and the "one—stop shopping" nature of a multispecialty group may make it more
attractive to consumers, thus relieving group members of the necessity of
finding patients.
Speaking to the issue of the efficient use of inputs, we examine the use

of non-physician medical personnel (HRSIJON) by calculating the value of the
marginal product and comparing it to the wage. Table 10 presents these

results. They point to underuse of aide—time for most specialties. These
results are consistent with the results from previous studies, expecially that
of Reinhardt (1975).

SUMMARY AND CO}JCLUSIONS

The goal of this paper was to investigate the determinants of productive
efficiency in partnerships. This has been done for the case of medical group
practice by using the frontier estimation technique and its associated

efficiency measures. We find that relating compensation to productivity does
increase the quantity and efficiency of production, as theory has
hypothesized. The number of members in a group decreases both the quantity
produced and the efficiency with which that output is produced.

Experience

does lead to greater productivity and efficiency. Medical groups in general
are measured as being no less efficient than an average manufacturing firm,
but Health Maintenance Organizations are less efficient than average.

Non—physician labor is underemployed, although this result could be an
artifact of unmeasured quality or defensive medicine.

Overall, the empirical results are consistent with theoretical work on
internal theory of the firm, which predicts that productivity compensation
schemes will work well for firms with non—joint production and observable
output. These two criteria are met by medical group practices. The treatment
of measured efficiency as an endogenous variable is unique and allows some
interesting insights into the determinants of productive efficiency. Future
research examining efficiency and its determinants for other services (e.g.,
law) and other types of compensation systems (e.g., bonus-penalty) would be
illuminating.
