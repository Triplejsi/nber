ABSTRACT
We propose a novel identification strategy of imposing sign restrictions directly on the impulse responses
of a large set of variables in a Bayesian factor-augmented vector autoregression. We conceptualize
and formalize conditions under which every additional sign restriction imposed can be qualified as
either relevant or irrelevant for structural identification up to a limiting case of point identification.
Deriving exact conditions we establish that, (i) in a two dimensional factor model only two out of
potentially infinite sign restrictions are relevant and (ii) in contrast, in cases of higher dimension every
additional sign restriction can be relevant improving structural identification. The latter result can
render our approach a blessing in high dimensions. In an empirical application for the US economy
we identify monetary policy shocks imposing conventional wisdom and find modest real effects avoiding
various unreasonable responses specifically present and pronounced combining standard recursive
identification with FAVARs.

SIGN RESTRICTIONS IN BAYESIAN FAVARS WITH AN

Pooyan Amir-Ahmadia and Harald Uhligb
We propose a novel identification strategy of imposing sign restrictions directly
on the impulse responses of a large set of variables in a Bayesian factor-augmented
vector autoregression. We conceptualize and formalize conditions under which every
additional sign restriction imposed can be qualified as either relevant or irrelevant for
structural identification up to a limiting case of point identification. Deriving exact
conditions we establish that, (i) in a two dimensional factor model only two out of
potentially infinite sign restrictions are relevant and (ii) in contrast, in cases of higher
dimension every additional sign restriction can be relevant improving structural identification. The latter result can render our approach a blessing in high dimensions.
In an empirical application for the US economy we identify monetary policy shocks
imposing conventional wisdom and find modest real effects avoiding various unreasonable responses specifically present and pronounced combining standard recursive
identification with FAVARs.
Keywords: Bayesian FAVAR, Dynamic Factor Models, Identification, Sign Restriction, Gibbs Sampling, Monetary Policy Shocks.

1. INTRODUCTION
What are the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks on the economy? To
answer these type of questions and generally policy analysis in time series settings
we suggest combining two recent advances in empirical macroeconomics: factoraugmented VARs (FAVAR) and identification per sign restrictions. We propose
and assess a novel identification strategy of imposing sign restrictions directly on
the impulse responses of large set of variables to shocks in a Bayesian FAVAR.
The novel feature and key strength of our approach is the additional “bite” due
to the differences in factor loadings across sets of time series representing, say,
“prices” or “output” resulting in a further minimized and refined identified set.
As an important advantage, our procedure does not require a structural interpretation of the factors themselves or adding observables to the list of factors1 .
For the application to monetary policy shocks we impose the conventional wisdom regarding the responses of prices, monetary aggregates, spreads and interest
rates.

We provide formal conditions to establish whether an additional sign restriction is relevantly binding and by that leading to an improved and refined identification further narrowing the bounds of the identified set towards exact point
identification. This is generally feasible due to the inherent large dimensional
nature of dynamic factor models and FAVARs. We demonstrate an important
distinction in those conditions for case of two or higher factor dimensions. In the
former case exactly two sign restriction are sufficient and we show what those
conditions are. In the latter case, theoretically every additional sign restriction
could potentially improve structural identification. In the limit of binding sign
restrictions the it can lead to exact point identification.
Our approach avoids the price puzzle by construction, and remains usable
for subsamples as well. We show this per applying our approach to a data set
ending in June 2010, thus including the 2008 financial crisis episode and the
ensuing quantitative easing policies of the Federal Reserve Bank, an episode
that generates considerable challenges to any strategy of identifying monetary
policy shocks: the results do not change much, even when we restrict the sample
to include only the “post-Volcker” years from 1984 to 2010 or excluding the
period in which quantitative easing was in place.
Following the lead of Sims [1972], Sims [1980] and Sims [1986], a large literature
has developed, analyzing the effects of monetary policy shocks with the aid of
vector autoregression (VAR). Most VAR studies consider a small number of variables in order to save degrees of freedom for keeping the model tractable2 . The
central bank is likely to take considerably more information into account when
choosing its course of actions, however. As pointed out by Bernanke and Boivin
[2003], monetary policy takes place in a “data-rich environment”. Bernanke and
Boivin [2003], Stock and Watson [2005] and Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005]
therefore introduced factor vector autoregression (FAVAR) models, combining
dynamic factor models with the VAR analysis.
Identifying assumptions are key. We propose to identify monetary policy shocks
with the help of sign restrictions, introduced by Dywer [1997], Faust [1998],
Canova and Pina [2005], Canova and De Nicoló [2002] and Uhlig [2005]. A survey and various extensions for structural VAR identified with sign restrictions
are in Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner and Zha [2010]. They also show how to efficiently draw from the Haar measure generating candidate rotation matrices.
Mumtaz and Surico [2009] and Mumtaz, Zabczyk and Ellis [2014] impose standard contemporaneous sign restrictions either directly on structured factors in a
FAVAR model or on the standard small set of variables respectively. Hamilton
and Baumeiseter [2015] study among others the role of the prior in set identified
structural VAR models potentially carrying over to the posterior with substantial weight. Arias, Waggoner and Rubio-Ramirez (2014) and Kilian and Murphy
(2012) show how to employ a mixture of zero and sign restrictions. Employing
sign restrictions, the response of key macroeconomic variables such as prices and

interest rates to a monetary policy shock is restricted to accord with a priori
theory, in order to achieve identification. Our key innovation compared to that
literature is to use a FAVAR approach allowing us to impose restrictions on a
comparatively large number of observable time series, potentially providing a
more exact identification. For example, not one, but many price series can and
will be restricted in their response: as each reacts somewhat differently to shocks,
the range of potential candidates for monetary policy shocks is reduced. This is
important, since sign restrictions offer weak or set identification, as opposed to
point identification, see Canova [2007] for a discussion of the latter. Compared
to other identification strategies in FAVARs as introduced as well as surveyed
by Stock and Watson [2005] and Stock and Watson [2011], our approach avoids
a structural interpretation of the factors themselves or adding observables to
the list of factors. In fact, our approach can be applied and is appealing more
broadly, when a substantial number of observable time series can potentially be
restricted in their response to a shock, and thus can also be applied in dynamic
factor models.
Sims and Zha [1998] review Bayesian methods for multivariate models and
their advantages: our paper is in that tradition. For the estimation we choose
a Bayesian likelihood-based estimation based on MCMC methods which is fully
parametric. Thus we can explicitly exploit the factor structure of the data and
the law of motion of the extracted factors. Our impulse response confidence
bands are posterior probability statements rather than confidence sets, an issue
raised and analyzed in Moon and Schorfheide [2012] and Granziera, Moon and
Schorfheide [2013], and discussed from a Bayesian perspective in Rubio-Ramı́rezWaggoner-Zha [2010]. Giacomini and Kitagawa (2015) propose general method
for conducting inference in SVARs that are partially identified due to inequality
restrictions. Their objective is to characterize the identified set using robust
Bayesian methods. We use a set of monthly macroeconomic data from 1960:02
to 2010:06, building and extending a data set provided by Stock and Watson. We
check for subsample stability. We compare the results from our approach to the
Cholesky identification in FAVARs, as proposed by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz
[2005]. We choose a benchmark specification in terms of the FAVAR as well as
the restrictions imposed, but have studied a number of variations, documented
in a technical appendix.
Compared to the VAR sign restriction literature, our confidence bands for the
on-impact response is typically considerably more narrow. For the full sample
as well as the post-Volcker sample, we find that a monetary policy shock one
standard deviation in size raises the Federal Funds Rate by about 15 basis points,
before eventually reverting course and an eventual decrease of 10 basis points. In
response, we find that industrial production decreases, with a maximum impact
of minus 0.2 percent at the median estimate after one year before reverting
back. For the subsectors, we find the smallest or even a positive reaction for
the industrial production in residential utilities as well as fuels, while industrial
production of business equipment as well as durable materials falls somewhat

4

P. AMIR-AHMADI, H. UHLIG

more strongly and more persistently than total industrial production. The effect
on real GDP is less pronounced. The posterior confidence bands includes zero or
positive reactions, consistent with Uhlig [2005]. We find that the forecast-error
revision variance of industrial production due to monetary policy shocks accounts
for less than 10 percent at the median estimate, which is consistent with results
in Sims and Zha [2006] and Uhlig [2005]. Similar results have been obtained
for the period of the US Great Depression in Sims [1999] and Amir Ahmadi
and Ritschl [2013]. Employment falls by 0.1 percent within two years, starting
from an initial zero response. Total unemployment puzzlingly shows an initial
fall of about 0.08 percentage points. The CPI falls by 0.1 percent on impact, and
by half a percent eventually within four years, showing a persistent response.
Yield spreads initially fall in response, and fall the more strongly, the longer the
maturity. The spread between the 3-month TBill and the Federal Funds Rate
falls by 5 basis points one month after the shock, whereas the spread between
the 10 year Treasury Bond and the Federal Funds Rate falls by 15 basis points.
The spread responses are rather tightly estimated.
For the Cholesky identification as proposed by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz
[2005], we find substantial prize puzzles. For the post-1984 subsample, for example, the CPI response is rather tightly estimated to rise by 0.1 percent within
a year. Even within four years, it remains considerably more likely that the
CPI response stays positive rather than turning negative. The commodity prices
increase on impact. We argue that these results render the Cholesky identification approach considerably less useful for the analysis of monetary policy shocks
than ours. The Cholesky decomposition implies a persistent fall in industrial
production, whereas our identification shows industrial production to return to
a near-zero uncertainty band within two years. This matters in particular for the
purpose of political debates regarding monetary policy choices, and provides all
the more reason to adapt our identification rather than a Cholesky identification
in a FAVAR.
2. THE MODEL
The idea of a factor vector autoregression or FAVAR, as introduced by Bernanke,
Boivin and Eliasz [2005], is to summarize the key dynamics of a large set of time
series by a small list, containing some common factors as well as some key variables. Time is indexed by t = 1, . . . , T . The small list of key variables is a [ny × 1]
vector fty . The remaining time series are a [nx × 1] vector xt . Let ft denote the
[nf × 1] vector of unobservable common factors of Xtc . The [nx × 1] vector et is
a time-t error term. The model is
(2.1)

Xtc = λc ftc + λy fty + et , with et ∼ N (0, Re ) iid

Here λc and λy denote the matrix of factor loadings of the factors and the
perfectly observable variables included as factors with dimension [nx × nf ] and

BFAVAR WITH SIGN RESTRICTION

[nx × ny ] respectively. The covariance matrix Re is assumed to be diagonal.
Hence the error terms of the observable variables are assumed to be mutually
uncorrelated. The FAVAR state equation represents the joint dynamics of factors
and the key variables ft = ((ftc )0 , (fty )0 )0 following a VAR(P) process.

where ut is the date-t reduced form shock, Qu is the factor error covariance
matrix and φp are the p-lag coefficient matrices. The dimensions are [K × 1],
[K×1] and [K×K] respectively, where the total number of factors is K = nf +ny .
We assume that Qu is of full rank.
3. IDENTIFICATION
3.1. Sign Restrictions in FAVARs and DFMs
The major objective of this paper is to identify structural shocks in a FAVAR,
per imposing sign restrictions on impulse responses as introduced by Uhlig [2005]
for the VAR framework. The specific application is to the identification of a
monetary policy shock.
The structural shocks νt ∈ R
I K are related to the reduced form shocks ut of
the factor VAR (2.2) per
ut = Aνt
where the matrix A is an orthogonal invertible matrix of dimension [K × K],
satisfying
Qu = AA0
arising from the assumption that the νt are uncorrelated and of unit variance,
E[νt νt0 ] = IK
The instantaneous response to any structural shock is an “impulse vector”, as
defined in Uhlig (2005):
Definition 1 The vector a ∈ R
I K is called an impulse vector, iff there is some
matrix A, so that AA0 = Qu and so that a is a column of A.
Per proposition 1 of Uhlig [2005,pp. 18], any impulse vector can be characterized as follows. Let ÃÃ0 = Qu be the Cholesky decomposition. Then a is an
impulse vector if and only if there is some K-dimensional vector α of unit length
so that
(3.1)

a = Ãα

P. AMIR-AHMADI, H. UHLIG

For estimation and further analysis, consider the companion form of (2.1) to
(2.2)
Ft = ΦFt−1 + ut
Xt = ΛFt + Et .
where Ft , Xt , Φ, Et are defined in the appendix, equations (A.4) in the usual
manner per stacking. Let a = [a0 , 01,K(P −1) ]0 . Compute
ra(f ) (s) = Φs a
to obtain the vector of impulse responses of ft to an impulse in a at horizon s.
Compute
ra(X) (s) = Λra (s).
to obtain the vector of impulse responses of Xt to an impulse in a at horizon s.
To impose sign restrictions means to pick a list L
I ⊆ {1, . . . , nf + ny + nx } of
variables among ft and Xt as well as a restriction horizon H ≥ 0.
Definition 2 The impulse vector a satisfies the sign restrictions (IL, H), if
(X)
(f )
I,j >
I , j ≤ nf + ny and ra (s)j−nf −ny ≥ 0 for all j ∈ L
ra (s)j ≥ 0 for all j ∈ L
nf + ny , for all s ∈ {0, . . . , H}.
For the ease of exposition, we have imposed that sign restrictions are always
positive. If the sign restriction on the original variable is negative, this can be
achieved by flipping the sign of the variable: in practice, one would simply distinguish between negative and positive restrictions, of course. Further, and for the
ease of exposition, we have assumed that the restriction horizon is the same for
all variables: this is rather trivial to generalize, at the expense of more cumbersome notation. Furthermore, one may wish to impose sign restrictions on several
impulse vectors or impose additional exact identifying restrictions: we do not
pursue these rather straightforward generalizations here, in the interest of space
and for the ease of exposition.
3.2. Many sign restrictions: when do they help?
In contrast to a VAR in a few variables, a FAVAR offers the opportunity
to impose sign restrictions on many variables in X. In particular, as the panel
dimension of the FAVAR diverges to infinity, one may have the opportunity to
impose ever more sign restrictions, in principle. While one can also contemplate
ever more sign restrictions in the VAR case per increasing the restriction horizon,
this is arguably far less sensible than, say, finding more price series or more asset
price series to constrain monetary policy impulse vectors.
The question then arises, whether they help and when? We seek to offer some
insights on this matter. To that end, we wish to express sign restrictions in terms
of sets for the impulse vector a. That vector only has an interpretation, if the
coefficient matrices Φ, Λ are known. These need to be estimated in practice. Further, the factors and thus Φ will generally only be exactly known asymptotically,

BFAVAR WITH SIGN RESTRICTION

as both the panel dimension and the time dimension approach infinity. From a
Bayesian perspective, which we adopt here throughout, the posterior will provide
candidate draws for Φ, Λ, which one can condition on. All these issues are wellunderstood outside the particular focus on sign restrictions here. We therefore
allow ourselves to assume Φ, Λ to be known, for the discussion here.
Given the sign restrictions (IL, H), values for Φ, Λ, enumerate the m = (H −
1) × ]I
L sign restrictions i = 1, . . . , m, i.e., every one of these i corresponds one
for one to some ji ∈ L
I and si ∈ {0, . . . , H}. For each i construct a row vector bi
of length nf + ny as follows. If ji ≤ nf + ny , let
bi = e(ji ) Φsi
where e(ji ) is a row vector of length nf + ny , with only zero entries, except for
(e(ji ) )ji = 1. If ji > nf + ny , let
bi = ẽ(ji −nf −ny ) ΛΦsi
where ẽ(ji −nf −ny ) is a row vector of length nx , with only zero entries, except for
(ẽ(ji −nf −ny ) )ji −nf −ny = 1. We shall refer to the bi as sign restriction vectors.

the matrix stacking all row vectors b1 , . . . , bm . Finally, define the set B =

I nf +ny ,
∗
define the dual cone C per
C ∗ = {y ∈ R
I nf +ny | x0 y ≥ 0 for all x ∈ C}
The following property is well-known in convex analysis: for completeness, we
provide a proof.
Proposition 1

For any subset C of R
I nf +ny , we have C ∗ = C ∗∗∗

Proof: If x ∈ C, then x0 y ≥ 0 for all y ∈ C ∗ per definition of C ∗ . Thus, x ∈ C ∗∗ .
This implies that C ∗∗∗ ⊆ C ∗ . Conversely, let y ∈ C ∗ . Then x0 y ≥ 0 for all x ∈ C ∗∗
per definition of C ∗∗ . Hence, y ∈ C ∗∗∗ .
Q.E.D.
The following characterization is now immediate.
Proposition 2 Given Φ, Λ, the following statements are equivalent:
1. The impulse vector a satisfies the sign restrictions (IL, H).
2. bi a ≥ 0 for all sign restriction vectors bi , i = 1, . . . , m.

8

P. AMIR-AHMADI, H. UHLIG

3. Ba ≥ 0.
4. a ∈ B ∗
5. a ∈ B ∗∗∗
Note that the sign restrictions only restrict the direction or cone for a. The
length restriction for a obtains from the requirement that AA0 = Qu , see equation
(3.1).
Equipped with these tools, we can characterize, when some additional sign
restriction is useful or not.
Definition 3 Given the sign restrictions (IL, H) and values for Φ, Λ, an additional sign restriction ba ≥ 0, characterized by a sign restriction vector b0 ∈
R
I nf +ny , is called irrelevant, if all a satisfying the sign restrictions (IL, H) also
satisfy ba ≥ 0.
With the insights above, we obtain
Proposition 3 An additional sign restriction ba ≥ 0 for some b0 ∈ R
I nf +ny
0
∗∗
is irrelevant, iff b ∈ B .
Note that B ∗∗ is the closure of the smallest convex cone containing B.
Proof: Per proposition 2, a satisfies the sign restrictions (IL, H), iff a ∈ B ∗∗∗ .
Suppose it does. If b0 ∈ B ∗∗ , we therefore have ba ≥ 0. Conversely, suppose that
b0 ∈
/ B ∗∗ . Then ba < 0 for some a ∈ B ∗ , and thus for some a satisfying the sign
restrictions (I
L, H), per proposition 2.
Q.E.D.
A rather clean distinction can and should be made between the two-dimensional
case and higher-dimensional cases3 .
Proposition 4 Suppose there are only two factors, nf + ny = 2. Suppose there
are finitely many sign restrictions, ]B < ∞ and that the sign restrictions are not
impossible to satisfy, i.e. that B ∗ 6= {0}. Then there are two sign restrictions b̂
and b̌, such that B ∗ = {b̂, b̌}∗ . The two sign restrictions solve
(3.2)

min
b̂,b̌∈B/{0}

b̂b̌0
|| b̂ || || b̌ ||

In words, with these two sign restrictions b̂ and b̌, which maximizes the angle
between them, all others are irrelevant.
Proof: Geometrically, the proposition is equivalent to the statement that a
closed cone in two dimensions is the area between two rays, which have the
maximal angle between them of all rays in the cone. This latter statement is
true by inspection.
Q.E.D.
3 We

leave out the trivial zero-dimensional and one-dimensional cases.

BFAVAR WITH SIGN RESTRICTION

It is worth emphasizing that this applies also to sign restrictions in twodimensional VARs: only two sign restrictions “matter”.
In dimensions higher than three, it can happen that no sign restriction is
irrelevant, i.e. no sign restriction is irrelevant, when added to the set of all other
sign restrictions. It suffices to provide an example in R
I 3 : it is then clear, that
this example can be generalized to all higher dimensions. For R
I 3 , let the sign
restrictions be characterized by bi = [cos θi , sin θi , 1], where the θi ∈ [0, π) are
all distinct. Examine one of these, say, b1 = [cos θ1 , sin θ1 , 1]. Consider aλ =
[− cos θ1 , − sin θ1 , λ] for λ ∈ [0, 1]. Note that
bi aλ = − cos(θi − θ1 ) + λ
>

−1 + λ

= b1 aλ
We can therefore find λ ∈ [0, 1], so that bi aλ > 0 for all i 6= 1, but b1 aλ < 0.
This shows that b1 is not irrelevant, when added to all other sign restrictions.
Finally, we can examine what happens as the panel dimension n = nx of
the FAVAR diverges to infinity. Suppose there are potentially infinitely many
sign restrictions L
I∞ ⊆ N
I , with the list L
I n of sign restrictions for any given
n = nx given by L
I ∞ ∩ {1, . . . , nf + ny + nx }. Does it help to impose ever more
sign restrictions? The analysis above provides the answer, at least conceptually.
Proposition 3 shows that if there is some n̄ and associated set of sign restriction
vectors Bn̄ , so that all additional b arising for larger panels are contained in
Bn̄∗∗ , i.e. the closure of the smallest cone containing Bn̄ , then these new sign
restrictions are irrelevant.
In the two-dimensional case, as proposition 4 and the geometric interpretation
in the proof shows, this irrelevance arises, if all future b-rays are within the two
boundary rays b̂n and b̌n of the panel-dimension-n FAVAR. On the other hand,
suppose that
b̂n b̌0n
|| b̂n || || b̌n ||

→κ

without reaching the limit at some n, where b̂n and b̌n are the extreme rays
of the panel-dimension-n FAVAR, calculated in proposition 4. Then there are
always new sign restrictions coming up with increasing the panel dimension,
which are not irrelevant. In the extreme case, where κ = −1, one obtains exact
identification of a, as n → ∞. It may not be particularly reasonable to hope for
such a tightening of sign restrictions, as the panel dimension diverges to infinity,
but such a hope might have a better foundation in any empirical application than
the hope that one can obtain exact identification in the sign-restricted VAR case,
with an ever increasing horizon.
In higher-dimensional cases, it may be that all new sign restrictions are relevant
as in example constructed above for R
I 3 : one can certainly construct a sequence
of θi ∈ [0, π), which are all distinct, i = 1, 2, . . .. One can also construct cases,

10

P. AMIR-AHMADI, H. UHLIG

where one gets exact identification of a, as n → ∞: this happens, if the cone
B ∗∗ , which is an intersection of half-spaces, converges4 to a ray.

3.3. Sign restrictions for monetary policy shocks
We proceed by imposing sign restrictions derived from “conventional wisdom”:
after a monetary policy contraction, the federal funds rate should increase, prices
should not increase and nonborrowed reserves as well as M1 should decrease. The
precise list is stated in section 4.
Assumption 1 A (contractionary) monetary policy impulse vector is
an impulse vector a so that the individual impulse response functions to a of
prices, nonborrowed reserves and M1 are not positive and the impulse responses
short term interest rate is positive, for a specified horizons s=0,. . . ,S.
Note that our strategy can be implemented, even if ny = 0, i.e., even if the
model is a dynamic factor model rather than a FAVAR.

3.4. Cholesky decomposition and monetary policy shocks in FAVARs
For comparison we also employ the Cholesky Identification following Bernanke,
Boivin and Eliasz [2005] who impose a recursive structure. We impose that fty =
[CP It , F F Rt ]0 , i.e., we use the CPI and the Federal Funds Rate as the key
macroeconomic variables in the overall list of factors ft . Let
ut = Ãνt
ÃÃ0 = Qu
where Ã is lower triangular Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix Qu of the
reduced form shocks ut and where the Federal Funds Rate as policy instrument
is ordered last in the FAVAR equation. A detailed description and defense of the
identification assumptions can be found in Bernanke et. al. [2005]. A survey and
discussion of alternatives identification schemes is provided in Stock and Watson
[2005], Stock and Watson [2011] and Stock and Watson [2015]. Note that this
strategy can only be implemented, when the policy instrument is part of the list
of factors, and therefore cannot be implemented in a dynamic factor model as
opposed to a FAVAR. Note that this strategy can only be implemented, when the
policy instrument (or a subeset of observable data) is part of the list of factors,
and therefore cannot be implemented in a dynamic factor model as opposed to
a FAVAR.
4 We use the word “converge” in this sentence somewhat loosely, but it can be given a precise
mathematical definition

BFAVAR WITH SIGN RESTRICTION

3.5. Misspecification
Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005] add the Federal Funds Rate as the key
policy variable to a list of factors. The following considerations show, that one
ought to also include those variables, for which the “noise” component in the
factor representation is relevant for the monetary authority, when choosing its
monetary policy instrument. If the true underlying monetary policy rule involves
a variable not spanned by factors then the corresponding monetary policy shock
is not spanned by factors. This leads to misspecifications and the identification
of the monetary policy shock is incorrect.
While this may sound reasonably obvious in this rather general form, it may
be less obvious why it is useful to also include the CPI in the list of factors. It
turns out that the FAVAR specification can be misspecified, if the monetary authority reacts to the “noise” component in the CPI and the CPI is not included
in the list of factors. Therefore, we include the CPI as well as the FFR in the
specification of our benchmark sign-restricted FAVAR model. These considerations may also show, why prices might respond positively to a monetary policy
shock identified in a FAVAR, when the CPI is not included in the core VAR.
This insight may help to understand the puzzling results for the CPI index in
figures IV and V of Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005].
To provide a simple example, suppose that an inflation component πt and an
interest rate component rt follow the data generating process
(3.3)
πt = −αrt−1 + γπt−1 + π,t
(3.4)
rt = φπt + m,t
where α, γ, φ are positive coefficients, where π,t and where m,t are shocks to
inflation and to monetary policy respectively, assumed to be independent with
2
each other and across time as well as normally distributed with variances σ,π
2
and σ,m .
It is best to think about the components πt and rt as the noise components
in a factor structure. The model above thus makes the extreme assumption, that
the monetary policy shock is entirely contained in the “noise” component of the
interest rates. There are also more general versions. For example, the structure
above is relevant if the monetary policy shock does not affect inflation via the
other factors, but solely through the direct effect of interest rates on the “noise
component” of inflation. It is also relevant, if part of the monetary policy shock
component in a FAVAR without inflation included in the core VAR can actually
be explained by movements in inflation, and it is the part of interest rates driven
by that component, which affects inflation.
Note that the model implies
(3.5)

πt = (γ − αφ)πt−1 + π,t − αm,t−1

12

P. AMIR-AHMADI, H. UHLIG

Assume that 0 ≤ γ − αφ < 1, and one can see that a positive monetary policy
shock m,t will affect inflation negatively with a one period delay, and with inflation gradually climbing back up to zero.
The empirical issue is now to correctly identify the monetary policy shock m,t .
The approach in Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005] recommends to add the federal funds rate to the available factors. Since there are no factors in the model
above (or since they have already been subtracted out), this amounts to estimating the model
(3.6)
rt = βrt−1 + ut
(3.7)
πt = λrt + νt
where the first equation represents the factor model (with zero factors aside from
the interest rate), the second equation is the factor representation of inflation
with a factor loading λ on the interest rate component as the only available
factor. Usually, ut would be interpreted as the monetary policy shock. Given the
assumptions above, the coefficients can easily be calculated.
Proposition 5 Assume 0 ≤ γ − αφ < 1.
1. The variance of the inflation component is given by
E[ππ] =

The variance of the interest rate component is given by

3. If φ > 0, then λ > 0. If φ = 0, then β = 0 and λ = 0.
Proof: These results follow from straightforward calculations:
1. The equation for E[ππ] follows directly from (3.5). For E[rr], use (3.4) to
write E[rr] = E[(φπ + m )(φπ + m )] and exploit E[πm ] = 0.
2. For the covariance E[rt πt ] of rt with πt or the autocovariance E[rt rt−1 ],
note E[rt πt ] = E[(φπt + m,t )πt ] = φE[ππ] as well as
E[rt rt−1 ] = E[φ(−αφrt−1 +γπt−1 +π,t )rt−1 ] = −αφE[rr]+γφE[rt πt ]
3.

Now, calculate β → E[rt rt−1 ]/E[rr] and λ → E[rt πt ]/E[rr].

Note now, that the impulse response of the inflation component to ut , the
“identified” monetary policy shock, is simply λ times the impulse response of rt
to a monetary policy shock. Since λ > 0 for φ > 0, there will be a price puzzle on
impact. If furthermore β > 0, a condition which is easily met, inflation appears
to react positively to a monetary policy shock throughout. Put differently, if the
”noise” inflation component matters to monetary policy in setting interest rates,
and if the researcher fails to include inflation in the ”core” VAR, one easily obtains a price puzzle.
On the other hand, note the shocks could be correctly identified from a VAR
in (rt , πt ) with one lag and a Cholesky-decomposition. Thus adding both, the
interest rate as well as inflation, to the factor specification, would resolve this
problem and result in correct identification of the monetary policy shock.
4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
4.1. Data, Model Specification and Identification
We follow the empirical approach of Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005]. They
use the data set of Stock and Watson [1998,1999] which consists of a panel of
120 macroeconomic variables in monthly frequency transformed to induce stationarity. For our analysis we have updated the data set documented in Stock
and Watson [2005] with observations from 1960:02-2003:12 to 1960:02-2010:06,
slightly changing the set of variables5 . The data set is listed in Appendix B.1.
To check on subsample stability, we also use 1960:02-1979:09 (“Pre-Volcker”) as
well 1984:02-2010:06 (“Post-Volcker”).
We use a total of K = 6 factors ft . We use ny = 2 key variables, the CPI
and the Federal Funds Rate, for reasons described in appendix 3.5, and nf = 4
general factors, which are “extracted” and sampled from the remaining time series in the estimation phase. We used P = 12 lags in the factor VAR. The horizon
for the sign restriction to hold is set to H = 6 which is based on Uhlig (2005). In
our baseline specification, the impulse responses of the following variables have
been sign-restricted, in order to achieve identification of the monetary policy
shock, where numbers refer to table I in appendix B.1:
1. prices: 104 to 111, 113, 114, 116 to 118.
2. monetary aggregates: M1 (69) and nonborrowed reserves (73).
3. interest rates: Federal Funds Rate (82).
We also examined a minimal restriction specification, where we have restricted
the following variables:
1. prices: commodity price index (108) and CPI (109).
2. monetary aggregates: M1 (69) and nonborrowed reserves (73).

3. interest rates: Federal Funds Rate (82).
The results are very similar to our benchmark identification, and we thus refrain
from reporting the results here: they are available in a technical appendix.
Alternatively, we examine an output-restricted specification where, in addition
to the full set of restrictions in our benchmark model, total industrial production
(17) as well as real GDP (18) is restricted to fall. This specification is useful for
economists, who believe that output surely falls after a monetary contraction,
and are interested in the shapes of the impulse responses and their quantitative magnitudes, given these additional identifying assumption. This turns out
to result in more tightly estimated responses and (unsurprisingly) rather clearly
negative responses for output. The results, in form of a comparison to our benchmark specification, is available in a technical appendix to this paper.
As a robustness check, we employed several variants of our strategy. The details are available as a technical appendix. We considered changing the set of
sign-restricted variables as well as the set of key variables fty included as factors.
Leaving out the CPI altered the results, which we suspect is due to the misspecification discussed in 3.5. We experimented with changing the number of general
factors extracted from the data. We found that little information was added by
increasing the dimension of the system, per analyzing the marginal contribution
of further factors for the explanation of the variation in the data based on R2 .
We tried several versions with different lag length, but the results compared to
the ones reported here do not differ much. We found a tendency that the impact
and intensity of the responses of restricted variables increases with the horizon
H. For additional subsample checks, we used the data sets 1984:02-2002:12 as
well as 1981:09-2002:12, to vary the begin of the “post-Volcker” episode and to
exclude the financial crisis of 2008.
4.2. Estimation
For the estimation, we rely on now standard techniques. A detailed survey
with several identification schemes in the classical estimation approach can be
found in Stock and Watson [2005]. Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005] present
two competing approaches. The second estimation approach described in their
paper is the one that we employ in this paper because the likelihood based
one-step estimation approach employing MCMC methods explicitly exploits the
factor structure. We employ a Bayesian approach. We estimate the model with
a multi-move Gibbs sampler for which we have to cast the model into its state
space representation. Details matter: they are described in appendix A. All our
results are based on 50000 simulation draws of the Gibbs sampler of which the
first 40000 were discarded as a burn-in, keeping only the last 10000, in order to
avoid an initial transient of the starting values that initiated the simulation. For
each of these draws, 100 impulse vectors are drawn and checked for consistency
with the sign restrictions: we keep the once that do to calculate the posterior
distributions.

BFAVAR WITH SIGN RESTRICTION

In order to assure that the results are based on converged simulations, that
represent the respective target distribution completely and e.g. not only some
local mode, we apply a number of standard convergence diagnostics for the simulated parameters. We checked the ineffciency factors in figure (14). In figure
(15)-(19) we plotted the first half of the kept draws against the second to check
whether the sampler is still ”moving” towards the target distribution or whether
the whole density of the distribution is represented. Details are reported in a
technical appendix.
We check the fit of our model. To this end, we estimated the R2 s from regressing the respective series onto the four factors. Results are listed in table (II)
in appendix B.2. These results provide a report to what extend the individual
series are driven by common components: those with a low R2 are driven by
idiosyncratic forces rather than the common factors. We find that the model
fits well overall. We also estimated the respective marginal contribution of each
factor, not reported here, for the explanatory part in the variation of the data.
We provide plots of the extracted factors in a technical appendix.
4.3. Impulse Response Analysis
The key statistics suited to answer the question at hand are impulse response
functions. Figure (1) shows some of the results for our benchmark specification.
A monetary policy shock one standard deviation in size raises the Federal Funds
Rate by about 15 basis points, before eventually reverting course and an eventual
decrease of 10 basis points. This may reflect either an attempt of the Federal
Reserve Bank to reverse an earlier mistake or reflect the increase in the implied
real rate, due to the fallen inflation rate. In response, we find that industrial production decreases, with a maximum impact of minus 0.2 percent at the median
estimate after one year before reverting back. The 80 percent posterior confidence
set two years after the shock ranges from a decline of 0.4 percent to an increase
of 0.5 percent. The CPI falls 0.1 percent on impact and nearly half a percent
eventually, showing a persistent response. By contrast the commodity price index
decreases less strong with a maximum impact after about a year (aside from the
initial reaction) before reverting back to the pre shock level a year later. Compared to CPI this may not be surprising as the commodity price index reflects
measures traded on the market with presumably more flexible prices.
The rather clearly negative and hump-shaped response of industrial production in (1) may appear to be in contrast to the more neutral finding regarding
real GDP reported in Uhlig [2005], when applying sign restrictions in a smallscale VAR. The resolution is partly the distinction between these two variables:
as figure (2) shows, the posterior confidence band for the response of real GDP
is rather symmetric around zero for the first 12 months following the shock,
consistent with Uhlig [2005]. Figure (2) shows that employment falls by 0.1 per-

cent within the first year, starting from an initial zero or modestly negative
response. Somewhat puzzlingly, unemployment shows an initial fall of 0.08 percentage points, but rises subsequently from that point during the first two years.
We speculate that this is either due to a discouragement effect of fewer displaced
workers re-entering the labor force and searching for employment, following a
contractionary monetary policy shock, or due to monetary policy misinterpreting a fall in unemployment as a rationale for raising interest rates. For more
disaggregated unemployment series, we essentially find only increases, however,
see figure (59) in the appendix.
Different sectors are affected differently. Figure (57) in the appendix shows the
impulse responses for the industrial production for a variety of sectors. We find
the smallest or even a positive reaction for the industrial production in residential
utilities as well as fuels, while industrial production of business equipment as well
as durable materials falls somewhat more strongly and more persistently than
total industrial production. Figure (58) in the appendix shows the reaction of
the different price indices. The producer price indices generally fall a bit more

than the consumer price indices. Note that we did not restrict the price indices
for medical care, or the implicit price deflators. This can serve as a cross-check
on our identification: indeed, they all react negatively, except for a very modest
price puzzle for the price index for medical services.
Yield spreads initially fall in response. Figure (3) shows the responses of the
spreads to the Federal Funds Rate one month after the shock, as a function of
maturity: the spread response is the larger, the longer the maturity of the bonds.
While the 3-mo-FF spread falls by 5 basis points, the 10-year bond falls by 12
basis points, at the median estimate and at the one-month horizon. Figure (62) in
the appendix shows the impulse response for each spread: the responses tend to
be stronger for longer maturities. These responses are rather tightly estimated.
Figures (4) and (5) show the impulse responses of figure (1), but for the
two subsamples 1960:02-1979:09 (“Pre-Volcker”) as well 1984:02-2010:06 (“PostVolcker”). The results for these variables as well as for most other variables
in the VAR remain reasonably robust during the first year or two after the
shock, though differences arise. In particular, there appears to be a continu-

ous sequence of reversals in the Federal Funds Rate in the pre-Volcker episode
than in the post-Volcker episode. One possible explanation may be that these
shocks in the pre-Volcker episode were mistakes that the Federal Reserve subsequently tried to undo, but overshooting a bit in doing so, and so forth. More
importantly, the results for the post-Volcker episode look reasonable and plausible, and more consistent with the results for the total sample, including the
response for the Federal Funds Rate. We find these results encouraging, as the
post-Volcker subsample includes the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent
quantitative easing episode, generating substantial challenges for any empirical
exercise aimed at identifying monetary policy shocks.
Surely, these results should be taken with a grain of salt. It is plausible, that
monetary policy has changed both in terms of its reactions to economic news,
as well as in its constraints (such as the zero lower bound) and tools. It would
be fascinating to extend the methods here to allow for smooth time variation as
analyzed e.g. in Primiceri [2005], Cogley-Sargent [2005] and Sargent-WilliamsZha [2006] or for Markov regime shifts as analyzed in Sims-Zha [2006], SimsWaggoner-Zha [2008] and Auerbach-Gorodnichenko [2012] or to extend the methods to allow for nonlinearities and the peculiarities of the zero lower bound. This
is beyond the scope of this paper. We rather wish to emphasize that reasonable
progress can already be made with the method at hand, that ours provides an important benchmark. However, note that the extension of our suggested approach
extends to the case of FAVARs with either time varying or Markov-Switching
parameters. Extensions of this method with these additional tools should provide

a promising avenue for future research.
Figure (6) shows the forecast error variance decompositions for our four key
variables, in the benchmark specification. Monetary policy shocks account for
less than 10% of the variation in industrial production and the Federal Funds
Rate, consistent with the view that the central bank typically does not role dice,
but do explain around 30 percent of the variation in the CPI. These results are
amongst others consistent with Sims [1999], Sims and Zha [2006], Uhlig [2005]
and Amir-Ahmadi and Ritschl [2008].
Figure (7) shows the impulse response functions for the post-Volcker sample
and a FAVAR-Cholesky identification of the monetary policy shock one standard
deviation in size as the last shock in the Cholesky decomposition of the factors,
where the federal funds rate is ordered last. The results for the entire sample are
very similar and available in a technical appendix. The most striking difference
is the unreasonable high and long lasting ”price puzzle”. The CPI response is
rather tightly estimated to rise by 0.1 percent within a year. Even within four
years, it remains considerably more likely that the CPI response stays positive

rather than turning negative. The commodity prices increase on impact. Another
anomaly is the increasing reaction (not shown) of nonborrowed reserves which
lasts for the whole horizon considered. We argue that these results render the
Cholesky identification approach considerably less useful for the analysis of monetary policy shocks than ours. While the Cholesky decomposition implies that
industrial production falls by nearly 0.4 percent within a year, and then stays
there, our post-Volcker response shown in (5) implies a modest fall by 0.2 percent
within a year, with subsequent reversal to an uncertainty band around a zero
response within two years. While the difference in the size of the response may
entirely be due to the initial difference of the movement in the Federal Reserve
Rate ( 30 basis points for the Cholesky decomposition versus 15 basis points for
our identification), the differences in the results regarding the persistence matters in particular for the purpose of political debates regarding monetary policy
choices, and provides all the more reason to adapt our identification rather than
a Cholesky identification in a FAVAR.

5. CONCLUSION
In this paper we propose to conduct structural identification combining Bayesian
FAVARs with sign restrictions. We show and discuss exact conditions under
which many sign restrictions improve structural identification up to the limiting
case of point identification. Furthermore we discuss the implication of misspecification and how they can lead to the ”price puzzle”. In our empirical application
we estimate the model from a Bayesian perspective relying on MCMC methods. To infer the effects of a contractionary shock to monetary policy we impose
sign restriction on the impulses responses on many prices, monetary aggregates
and short term interest rates. FAVAR models as well as dynamic factor models offer the opportunity to impose a larger set of reasonable sign restrictions,
leading to sharper identification and results. Sign restrictions in FAVARs offer
the advantage of avoiding a structural interpretation of the factors themselves
or adding observables to the list of factors. Our approach should therefore prove
to be appealing in many applications beyond the one studied here. Our results

are reasonable, even with the inclusion of the post-2008 financial-crisis data and
remain fairly robust across subsamples, while a more conventional Cholesky identification leads to unreasonably large price puzzles. Compared to the VAR sign
restriction literature, our confidence bands for the on-impact response is typically
considerably more narrow. We find that after a contractionary monetary policy
shock a negative response of output but modest in size. We find that industrial
production decreases after a monetary contraction one standard deviation in
size, with a maximum impact of minus 0.2 percent at the median estimate after
one year, before returning to an uncertainty band around zero within two years.
The effect on real GDP is less pronounced and includes zero within the posterior
confidence band throughout. Monetary policy shocks account for less than 10
percent of the variation in industrial production and the Federal Funds Rate.
The CPI falls by 0.1 percent initially and by half a percent eventually, showing a
persistent response. Yield spreads initially fall in response, with the fall ranging
from 5 basis points for the 3-month to Federal Funds Rate spread to 25 basis

APPENDIX A: ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE
For the estimation of FAVAR models Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005] present two competing approaches. The first one, which they prefer due to their results and the computational
simplicity is the two-step estimation based on a dynamic principal component approach. This
classical approach goes back to Stock and Watson [2003]. A detailed survey with several identification schemes in the classical estimation approach can be found in Stock and Watson [2005].
The second estimation approach described in their paper is the one that we employ in this
paper because the likelihood based one-step estimation approach employing MCMC methods
explicitly exploits the factor structure. We pursue the multi-move Gibbs sampler for which we
have to cast the model into the state space representation. Let (2.2) be extended by fty which

IK(P −1)

A.1. Factor Identification
The factors are only identified up to an invertible rotation. Any rotation of the factors results
in the same likelihood for the factors though the models are different. Identifying restrictions

24

have to be set, in order to distinguish the idiosyncratic from the common component. Additionally one can set further identifying assumptions in order to identify the factors and the
loadings, separately. We follow the standard identification restrictions either on the factor loading matrix employed by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005] for unique identification against
rotational indeterminacy. Since factors are estimated up to a rotation, the normalization should
not affect the space spanned by the estimated factors. In the joint estimation case the specified
identification against rotation requires that the factors are uniquely identified in the following
form
(A.9)
ft∗ = Aftc − Bfty
where A and B are nonsingular. Restrictions are only imposed on the observation equation.
Here we substitute Ft∗ into (2.1) due to the fact that restrictions should not be imposed on
the VAR dynamics we obtain
Xtc = λc A−1 ft∗ + (λy + λc A−1 B)fty + et .
(A.10)
For unique identification of the factors and the loadings it is required that λc A−1 = λc and
λy + λc A−1 B = λy . As discussed in Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005] sufficient conditions
are to set the upper Kc × Kc block of λc to identity and the upper Kc × Ny block of λy to a
zero matrix6 .

A.2. Inference
Bayesian analysis treats the parameters of the model as random
variables. We are interested

in inference on the parameter space θ = λf , λy , Re , φ, Qu and the factors {ft }T
t=1 . Multi
move Gibbs Sampling alternately samples the parameters θ and the factors ft , given the data.
We use the multi move version of the Gibbs sampler because this approach allows us, as a first
step, to estimate the unobserved common components, namely the factors via the Kalman
filtering technique conditional on the given hyperparameters and data, and as a second step
calculate the hyperparameters of the model given the factors and data via the Gibbs sampler in
the respective blocking. Let X T = (Xt , . . . , XT ) and F T = (F1 , . . . , FT ) define the respective
histories. For the estimation of the model we want to derive the posterior densities which
requires to empirically approximating
the marginal posterior densities of F T and θ:
Z
p(F T )

=

p(θ)

=

p(F T , θ)dθ

Z

p(F T , θ)dF T

where
p(F T , θ)
is the joint posterior density and the integrals are taken with respect to the supports of θ and
F T respectively. The procedure applied to obtain the empirical approximation of the posterior
distribution is the previously mentioned multi move version of the Gibbs sampling technique
by Carter and Kohn [1994] and Frühwirth-Schnatter [1994]7 .

A.3. Choosing the Starting Values
In general one can start the iteration cycle with any arbitrary randomly drawn set of parameters, as the joint and marginal empirical distributions of the generated parameters will
converge at an exponential rate to its joint and marginal target distributions as S → ∞. This
has been shown by Geman and Geman [1984]. Since Gelman and Rubin [1992] have shown
that a single chain of the Gibbs sampler might give a ”false sense of security ”, it has become
6 Note that this identification strategy is over-identified. However, for comparison purposes
we follow closely the approach of Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005].

Boivin and Eliasz [2005]

common practice to try out different starting values. We check our results based on four different strategies regarding the set of starting values. One out of many convergence diagnostics
involves testing the fragility of the results with respect to the starting values. For the results
to be reliable, estimates based on different stating values should not differ. Strictly speaking, the different chains should represent the same target distribution. In order to verify we
resestimated our model initialzing our Gibbs sampler in the following different ways
(i) Randomly draw θ0 from (over)dispersed distribution
(ii) Set θ0 to rather ”agnostic values” which involves setting 0’s for coefficients and 1’s for
variances8
(iii) Set θ0 to results from principal component analysis.9 In such a way the number of draws
required for convergence can be reduced considerably.
(iv) Set θ0 to parameters of the last iteration of the previous run.
Results are robust to the various initialization strategies.

A.4. Conditional density of the factors F T given X T and θ
In this subsection we want to sample from p(F T | X T , θ) assuming that the data and the
hyperparameters of the parameter space θ are given, hence we describe Bayesian inference on
the dynamic evolution of the factors ft conditional on Xtc for t = 1, . . . , T and conditional on
θ. The transformations that are required to draw the factors have been done in the previous
section. The conditional distribution, from which the state vector is generated, can be expressed
as the product of conditional distributions by exploiting the Markov property of state space
models in the following way
T −1

p(F T | X T , θ) = p(FT | X T , θ)

Y

p(Ft | Ft+1 , X T , θ)

t=1

The state space model is linear and Gaussian, hence we have:
(A.11)
FT | X T , θ ∼ N (FT |T , PT |T )
(A.12)
with
(A.13)

Ft|T | Ft+1|T , X T , θ

∼

E(FT | X T , θ)

PT |T

=

Cov(fT | X T , θ)

(A.15)

Ft|t,Ft+1|T

=

E(Ft | Ft|t , Ft+1 , θ)

(A.16)
Pt|t,Ft+1|T = Cov(Ft | Ft|t , Ft+1 , θ).
We first run the Kalman filter generating Ft|t and Pt| for t = 1, . . . , T . For the initialization
we set F1|0 = 0KP ×1 and P1|0 = IKP and iterate through the Kalman filter according to
(A.17)
Ft|t = Ft|t−1 + Pt|t−1 Λ0 H −1 ηt|t−1
(A.18)
Pt|t = Pt|t−1 − Pt|t−1 Λ0 H −1 ΛPt|t−1
where ηt|t−1 = (Xt − ΛFt|t−1 ) is the conditional forecast error and its covariance is denoted
by Ht|t−1 = (ΛPt|t−1 Λ0 + Re ). Furthermore let
(A.19)
Ft|t−1 = ΦFt−1|t−1
(A.20)
Pt|t−1 = ΦPt−1|t−1 Φ0 + Qu .
The last iteration of the Kalman filter yields FT |T and PT |T required for (A.11) to draw the
last observation and start the Kalman smoother according to (A.12) going backwards through

K × K block of Q and Φ∗ and Ft∗ denote the first K rows of Φ and Ft respectively. This is
required when Q is singular which is the case for the companion form when there is more than
one lag in (A.3). Here we closely follow Kim and Nelson [1999] where a detailed explanation
and derivation can be found.

A.5. Conditional density of the parameters θ given X T and F T
Sampling from the conditional distribution of the parameters p(θ | X T , F T ) requires the
blocking of the parameters into the two parts that refer to the observation equation and to
the state equation respectively. The blocks can be sampled independently from each other
conditional on the extracted factors and the data.
A.5.1. Conditional density of Λ and Re
This part refers to observation equation of the state space model which, conditional on
the estimated factors and the data, specifies the distribution of Λ and Re . The errors of the
observation equation are mutually orthogonal with diagonal Re . Hence we can apply equation
by equation OLS in order to obtain the ols estimates Λ̂n and êc as the observation equation
amounts to a set of independent regressions. Note that the subscript n refers to the n-th
equation and all hat variables refer to the respective ols estimates. We assume conjugate priors
p(Rnn ) = IG(δ0 /2, η0 /2)

)
p(Λn | Rnn ) = N (Λn0 , Rnn Mn0
which according to Bayesian results10 conform to the following conditional posterior distribution

Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz [2005] in order to allow an adequate comparison. M0 denotes the
matrix in the prior on the coefficients of the n-th equation of Λn . The factor normalization
discussed earlier requires to set M0 = I. The regressors of the n-th equation are represented
by FTn and the fitted errors of the n-th equation are represented by eˆct n .



A.5.2. Conditional density of vec(φ) and Qu
The next Gibbs block requires to draw vec(φ) and Qu conditional on the most current draws
of the factors and the data. We employ the Normal-Inverse Wishart prior according to Uhlig
[1994]
p(Qu ) = IW(S0 , ν0 )
p(vec(φ) | Qu )
10 For

N (φ̄0 , Qu ⊗ N0−1 )

which results in the following posterior:

This prior and has the following specification
ν0 = 0
ST

=

N0 = 0K×K
where the choice of S0 and φ̄0 are arbitrary as they cancel out in the posterior. We alternatively
also implemented the Normal-Wishart prior for according to Kadiyala and Karlsson [1997]
where the diagonal elements of Q0 are set to the corresponding p-lag univariate autoregressions,
σi2 . The diagonal elements of Ω0 are constructed such that the prior variances of the parameter
of the k lagged j’th variable in the i’th equation equals σi2 /kσj2 . Hence S0 = Q0 and φ̄0 = 0.
Results were virtually the same. To ensure stationarity, we truncate the draws by discarding
the draws of φ with the larges eigenvalue greater than 1 in absolute value.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX — NOT FOR PUBLICATION
A.4. Figures: Convergence Diagnostics
Following Primiceri(2005), we assess the convergence of the Markov chain by inspecting the
autocorrelation properties of the ergodic distributions draws. Specifically, in what follows, we
consider the draws inefficiency factors (henceforth, IFs), defined as the inverse of the relative
numerical efficiency measure of Geweke
Z π (1992),
−1 1

is the spectral density of the sequence of draws from the Gibbs sampler for the quantity of
interest at the frequency ω. We estimate the spectral densities by smoothing the periodograms
in the frequency domain by means of a Bartlett spectral window. Following Berkowitz and
Diebold (1998), we select the bandwidth parameter automatically via the procedure introduced by Beltrao and Bloomfield (1987). Figures (XXX) show, the draws IFs for the models
hyperparametersi.e. the free elements of the matrices B, Q, Λ, R, F . As the figures show, the
autocorrelation of the draws is uniformly very low, being in the vast majority of cases around
or below 2, thus suggesting that the Markov chains have indeed converged11 .

Figure 14.— Inefficiency Factors for all parameters

This figure reports the inefficiency factors (IFs) for the posterior estimates of the parameters.
The IF is the inverse of the relative
P∞ numerical efficiency measure of Gewekes (1992), i.e. the
IF is an estimate of (1 + 2 k=1 ρk ), where ρk is the k-th autocorrelation of the chain.
Following Primiceri (2005) our estimates estimate are performed using a 4 percent tapered
window for the estimation of the spectral density at frequency zero. Values of the IFs below
or around twenty are regarded as satisfactory. All parameters are clearly below with the
highest IF of 2.

11 As stressed by Primiceri (2005, Appendix B), values of the IFs below or around twenty
are generally regarded as satisfactory.

In the Figure (21)-(26) we compare the results for the output-restricted specification to the
results from the benchmark specification. While it may not be surprising that we find a more
pronounced decline in industrial production as a result, we also find considerably tighter confidence bands, indicating that this particular identification restriction has considerable “bite”.
We do not recommend imposing it, however, unless one already “believes” in the continuous,
contractionary impact of a monetary policy shock, and wishes to examine its quantitative
consequences, given this additional assumption.
