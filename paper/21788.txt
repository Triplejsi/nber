ABSTRACT
We study the extent to which eminent scientists shape the vitality of their areas of scientific
inquiry by examining entry rates into the subfields of 452 academic life scientists who pass away
prematurely. Consistent with previous research, the flow of articles by collaborators into affected
fields decreases precipitously after the death of a star scientist. In contrast, we find that the flow
of articles by non-collaborators increases by 8.6% on average. These additional contributions are
disproportionately likely to be highly cited. They are also more likely to be authored by scientists
who were not previously active in the deceased superstar's field. Intellectual, social, and resource
barriers all impede entry, with outsiders only entering subfields that offer a less hostile landscape
for the support and acceptance of “foreign” ideas. Overall, our results suggest that once in control
of the commanding heights of their fields, star scientists tend to hold on to their exalted position a
bit too long.

Introduction
Whether manna from heaven or the result of the purposeful application of research and

development, technological advances play a foundational role in all modern theories of economic growth (Solow 1957, Romer 1990, Aghion and Howitt 1992). Only in the latter part
of the nineteenth century, however, did technological progress start to systematically build
upon scientific foundations (Mokyr 1990, 2002). Economists—in contrast to philosophers,
historians, and sociologists (Kuhn 1962, Shapin 1996, Merton 1973)—have devoted surprisingly little effort to understanding the processes and institutions that shape the evolution of
science.1 How do researchers identify problems worthy of study and choose among potential
approaches to investigate them?
Presumably these choices are driven by a quest for recognition and scientific glory, but
the view that scientific advances are the result of a pure competition of ideas—one where the
highest quality insights inevitably emerge as victorious—has long been considered a Panglossian but useful foil (Kuhn 1962; Akerlof and Michaillat 2017). Indeed, the provocative
quote from Max Planck in the epigraph of this paper underscores that even the most celebrated scientist of his era understood that the pragmatic success of a scientific theory does
not entirely determine how quickly it gains adherents, or its longevity.
Can the idiosyncratic stances of individual scientists do much to alter, or at least delay,
the course of scientific advance? Perhaps for the sort of scientific revolutions that Planck—
the pioneer of quantum mechanics—likely had in mind, but the proposition that established
scientists are slower than novices in accepting paradigm-shifting ideas has received little
empirical support whenever it has been put to the test (Hull et al. 1978; Gorham 1991; Levin
et al. 1995). Paradigm shifts are exceedingly rare, however, and their very nature suggests
1

A notable exception is the theoretical model of scientific revolutions developed by Bramoullé and SaintPaul (2010).

1

that once they emerge, it is exceedingly costly to resist or ignore them. In contrast, “normal”
scientific advance—the regular work of scientists theorizing, observing, and experimenting
within a settled paradigm or explanatory framework—may be more susceptible to political
jousting. The absence of new self-evident and far reaching truths means that scientists must
compete in a crowded intellectual landscape, sometime savagely, for the supremacy of their
ideas (Bourdieu 1975).
In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences setup to test “Planck’s Principle” in the
context of academic biomedical research, an enormous domain which has been the province
of normal scientific change ever since the “central dogma” of molecular biology (Crick 1970)
emerged as a unifying description of the information flow in biological systems. Specifically,
we examine how the premature death of 452 eminent scientists alter the vitality (measured
by publication rates and funding flows) of subfields in which they actively published in
the years immediately preceding their passing, compared to matched control subfields. In
contrast with prior work that focused on collaborators (Azoulay et al. 2010; Oettl 2012;
Jaravel et al. 2018; Mohnen 2018), our work leverages new tools to define scientific subfields
which allows us to expand our focus to the response by scientists who may have similar
intellectual interests with the deceased stars without ever collaborating with them.
To our surprise, it is not competitors from within a subfield that assume the mantle of
leadership, but rather entrants from other fields that step in to fill the void created by a
star’s absence. Importantly, this surge in contributions from outsiders draws upon a different
scientific corpus and is disproportionately likely to be highly cited. Thus, consistent with the
contention by Planck, the loss of a luminary provides an opportunity for fields to evolve in
novel directions that advance the scientific frontier. The rest of the manuscript is dedicated
to elucidating the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.
It does not appear to be the case that stars use their influence over financial or editorial
resources to block entry into their fields, but rather that the very prospect of challenging
a luminary in the field serves as a deterrent for entry by outsiders. Indeed, most of the
entry we see occurs in those fields that lost a star who was especially accomplished. Even
in those fields that have lost a particularly bright star, entry can still be regulated by key
collaborators left behind. We find suggestive evidence that this is true in fields that have
coalesced around a narrow set of techniques or ideas or where collaboration networks are
particularly tight-knit. We also find that entry is more anemic when key collaborators of

2

the star are in positions that allow them to limit access to funding or publication outlets to
those outside the club that once nucleated around the star.
To be clear, we are not arguing that stars are a net negative for scientific progress.
Indeed, given the outsized accomplishments of the eminent scientists in our sample, this
seems quite unlikely. Rather, our results suggest that, once in control of the commanding
heights of their fields, star scientists tend to hold on to their exalted position—and to the
power that comes with it—a bit too long. Moreover, the entrants who boost activity into the
subfields formerly occupied by the deceased star are disproportionately likely to be future
stars, providing evidence that the outsiders of today can often turn into the stars of tomorrow.
This “circle of scientific life” underscores the importance of caution when drawing welfare
implications about the existence of stars writ large.
To our knowledge, this manuscript is the first to examine the dynamics of scientific
evolution using the standard empirical tools of applied microeconomics.2 We conceptualize
the death of eminent scientists as shocks to the structure of the intellectual neighborhoods in
which they worked several years prior to their death, and implement a procedure to delineate
the boundaries of these neighborhoods in a way that is scalable, transparent, and does not
rely on ad hoc human judgment. The construction of our dataset relies heavily on the PubMed
Related Citations Algorithm [PMRA], which groups scientific articles into subfields based
on their intellectual content using abstract words, title words, and very detailed keywords
drawn from a controlled vocabulary thesaurus curated by the National Library of Medicine.
As such, we are able to delineate circumscribed areas of scientific inquiry whose boundaries
are not defined by shared training, collaboration, or citation relationships.
In addition to providing evidence regarding a central question for scholars studying the
scientific process, our paper is among the very few economic studies that attend to the ways
in which scientists position themselves in intellectual space (cf. Borjas and Doran [2015a,
2015b] and Myers [2018] for other notable examples). As such, our work can be understood
as integrating the traditional concerns of economists—understanding how incentives and
2

Considerable work outside of economics has examined the evolution of scientific fields through network
and community detection techniques (e.g., Rosvall & Bergstrom 2008; Börner, Chen, and Boyack 2003; cf.
Fortunato and Hric (2016) for a review of this fast evolving research area). These approaches rely on collaboration or citation links to define the vertices of the knowledge network used to partition a scientific space
into subfields. While social scientists have utilized these techniques to explain a wide range of phenomena
(e.g., Foster, Rzhetsky, and Evans 2015), these approaches are less well-suited to our setting where citation
and collaboration are among the primary outcomes of interest.

institutions influence the rate of knowledge production or diffusion—with those of cognate
disciplines such as sociology and philosophy, who have traditionally taken the direction of
scientific change as the central problem to be explained.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we examine the institutional
context and lay out our broad empirical strategy. In section 3, we then turn to data, methods
and descriptive statistics. We report the results in section 4. Section 5 concludes by outlining
the implications of our findings for future work.

2

Institutional Context and Empirical Design
Our empirical analyses are centered on the academic life sciences. The merits of this

focus are several fold. First, the field has been an important source of scientific discovery
over the past half century. Many modern medical therapies can trace their origins to research
conducted in academic laboratories (Sampat and Lichtenberg 2011; Azoulay, Li, and Sampat
2017). These discoveries, in turn, have generated enormous health and welfare gains for
economies around the world.
Second, the life science research workforce is exceedingly large and specialized. The Faculty Roster of the Association of American Medical Colleges lists more than 200,000 faculty
members employed in U.S. medical schools and academic medical centers in 2015.3 Moreover, scientific discoveries over the past half-century have greatly expanded the knowledge
frontier, necessitating increasing specialization by researchers and a greater role for collaboration (Jones 2009). If knowledge and techniques remain at least partially tacit long after
their initial discovery, tightly-knit research teams may be able to effectively control entry into
intellectual domains. The size and maturity of this sector, including its extensive variety of
narrowly-defined subfields, makes it an ideal candidate for an inquiry into the determinants
of the direction of scientific effort in general, and how it is influenced by elite scientists in
particular.
Third, the academic research setting also offers the practical benefits of an extensive
paper trail of research inputs, outputs, and collaboration histories. On the input side,
reliance of researchers on one agency for the majority of their funding raises the possibility

This figure excludes life science academics employed in graduate schools of arts and science or other nonmedical school settings such as MIT, Rockefeller University, The Salk Institute, UC Berkeley, the intramural
campuses of NIH, etc.

4

that financial gatekeeping by elite scientists could be used to regulate entry into scientific
fields. Data on NIH funding at the individual level, as well as membership in “study sections”
(the peer-review panels that evaluate the scientific merits of grant applications) will allow us
to examine such concerns directly. Most importantly for our study, the principal output of
researchers—publications—are all indexed by a controlled vocabulary of keywords managed
by the National Library of Medicine. This provides the raw material that helps delineate
scientific subfields without appealing to citation linkages or collaborative relationships (the
specifics of this process are described in detail in Section 3.2 and Appendix C).
These many virtues, however, may come at the expense of generalizability. While the life
sciences span a wide range of research styles—from small-team data-driven epidemiology,
to medium-size laboratories under the helm of a single principal investigator, to large-scale
multi-institution clinical trials—most biomedical researchers cluster topically and socially in
small, quasi-independent subfields. This broad domain seldom features exceedingly small
research teams (as in pure mathematics) or “big science” efforts where capital needs are so
extensive and specialized as to fully consolidate the field into a single or a handful of large
authorship teams (as in high-energy particle physics, e.g., Aad et al. 2015). As such, one
should refrain from applying our findings to other fields of science where the structure of
collaborative efforts and the degree of intellectual clustering are likely to generate different
patterns of succession, compared to those observed in the life sciences.
Accounts by practicing scientists indicate that collaboration plays a large role in both the
creation and diffusion of new ideas (Reese 2004), and historians of science have long debated
the role of controversies and competition in shaping the direction of scientific progress and
the process through which new subfields within the same broad scientific paradigm are born
and grow over time (Hull 1988; Morange 1998; Shwed and Bearman 2010). Our study
presents a unique opportunity to test some of their insights in a way that is more systematic
and can yield generalizable insights on the dynamics of field evolution.

Empirical Design, Data, and Descriptive Statistics
Below, we provide a detailed description of the process through which the matched scien-

tist/subfield dataset used in the econometric analysis was assembled. We begin by describing
the criteria used to select our sample of superstar academics, with a particular focus on “extinction events”; the set of subfields in which these scientists were active prior to their death

5

and the procedure followed to delineate their boundaries. Finally, we discuss the matching
procedure implemented to identify control subfields associated with eminent scientists who
did not pass away but are otherwise similar to our treatment group.

3.1

Superstar sample

Our basic approach is to rely on the death of “superstar” scientists as a lever to estimate
the extent to which the production of knowledge in the fields in which they were active
changes after their passing. The study’s focus on the scientific elite can be justified both on
substantive and pragmatic grounds. The distribution of publications, funding, and citations
at the individual level is extremely skewed (Lotka 1926; de Solla Price 1963) and only a tiny
minority of scientists contribute, through their published research, to the advancement of
science (Cole and Cole 1972). Stars also leave behind a corpus of work and colleagues with a
stake in the preservation of their legacy, making it possible to trace back their careers, from
humble beginnings to wide recognition and acclaim.
The elite academic life scientist sample includes 12,935 individuals, which corresponds
to roughly 5% of the entire relevant labor market. In our framework, a scientist is deemed
elite if they satisfy at least one of the following criteria for cumulative scientific achievement:
(1) highly funded scientists; (2) highly cited scientists; (3) top patenters; and (4) members
of the National Academy of Sciences or of (5) the National Academy of Medicine. Since
these criteria are based on extraordinary achievement over an entire scientific career, we
augment this sample using additional criteria to capture individuals who show great promise
at the early and middle stages of their scientific careers (so-called “shooting stars”). These
include: (6) NIH MERIT awardees; (7) Howard Hughes Medical Investigators; and (8) early
career prize winners. Appendix A provides additional details regarding these metrics of
“superstardom” and explores the sensitivity of our core set of results to the type of scientists
(“cumulative stars” vs. “shooting stars”) included in the sample.
For each scientist, we reconstruct their career from the time they obtained their first
position as independent investigators (typically after a postdoctoral fellowship) until 2006.
Our dataset includes employment history, degree held, date of degree, gender, and depart-

6

ment affiliations as well as complete list of publications, patents and NIH funding obtained
in each year by each scientist.4
The 452 scientists who pass away prematurely, and who are the particular focus of this
paper, constitute a subset of this larger pool of 12,935. To be included in our sample, their
deaths must intervene between 1975 and 2003 (this allows us to observe at least three years’
worth of scientific output for every subfield after the death of a superstar scientist). Although
we do not impose any age cutoff, the median and mean age at death is 61 with 85% of these
scientists having passed away before the age of 70 (we explore the sensitivity of our results
to the age at death in Appendix E). We also require evidence, in the form of published
articles and/or NIH grants, that these scholars were still in a scientifically active phase of
their career in the period just preceding their death (this is the narrow sense in which we
deem their deaths to have occurred prematurely).
Within this sample, 229 (51%) of these scientists pass away after a protracted illness,
whereas 185 (41%) die suddenly and unexpectedly. We were unable to ascertain the particular circumstances of 37 (8.20%) death events.5 Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for
the deceased superstar sample. The median star received her degree in 1957 and died at the
age of 61. 40% of the stars hold an MD degree (as opposed to a PhD or MD/PhD), and
90% of them are male. On the output side, the stars each received an average of roughly
16.6 million dollars in NIH grants, and published 138 papers that garnered 8,341 citations
over the course of their careers (as of 2015).

3.2

Delineating Research Fields

The source of the publication data is PubMed, an online resource from the National
Library of Medicine that provides fast, free, and reliable access to the biomedical research
literature. PubMed indexes more than 40,000 journals within the life sciences.
To delineate the boundaries of the research fields in which each deceased star was active, we develop an approach based on topic similarity between each article where the star
4

Appendix B details the steps taken to ensure that the list of publications is complete and accurate, even
in the case of stars with frequent last names. Though we apply the term of “star” or “superstar” to the
entire group, there is substantial heterogeneity in intellectual stature within the sample (see Table 1).

Table A3 in Appendix A provides the full list of deceased superstars, together with their year of birth
and death, cause of death, institutional affiliation at the time of their passing, and a short description of
their research expertise.

appeared as a last author in a window of five years prior to her death, and the rest of the
scientific literature.6 Specifically, we use the PubMed Related Citations Algorithm (Lin and
Wilbur 2007) which relies heavily on Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), but not in any way
on citation or collaboration linkages.
MeSH terms constitute a controlled vocabulary maintained by the National Library of
Medicine that provides a very fine-grained partition of the intellectual space spanned by the
biomedical research literature. Importantly for our purposes, MeSH keywords are assigned
to each publication by professional indexers who focus solely on their scientific content. That
said, the PubMed Related Citations Algorithm (hereafter PMRA) also uses title and abstract
words as inputs, which are selected by the authors, and may reflect their aspirations. While
this raises the possibility that our subfield definitions are not impervious to social influences,
it does offer one advantage, namely that our subfield boundaries can quickly reflect the
emergence of new terms whose inclusion in the official MeSH thesaurus will occur with some
lag.7 Regardless, as will become clear in the next section, our difference-in-differences design
alleviates the concern that idiosyncratic features of PMRA might affect our conclusions,
since these would influence treatment and control subfields in a symmetric fashion.
We then use the “Related Articles” function in PubMed to harvest journal articles that
are intellectually proximate to the star scientists’ own papers in the last five years of her life.8
Appendix C describes the algorithm in more detail and performs extensive robustness checks.
In particular, we verify that the cutoff rules used by PMRA to generate a set of intellectual
neighbors for a given source article do not induce treated subfields to exhibit idiosyncratic
truncation patterns—from above or from below—compared to control subfields. Using a
tunable version of PMRA, we also assess the robustness of our core results to manipulations
6

A robust social norm in the life sciences systematically assigns last authorship to the principal investigator, first authorship to the junior author who was responsible for the conduct of the investigation, and
apportions the remaining credit to authors in the middle of the authorship list, generally as a decreasing
function of the distance from the extremities (Zuckerman 1968; Nagaoka and Owan 2014). Only in the case
of last authorship can we unambiguously associate the star with a subfield.
7
Importantly, defining subfields as isomorphic to the set of articles related (in a PMRA-sense) to a source
article does not imply a fixed number of articles per subfield. On the contrary, PMRA-generated subfields
can be of arbitrary large size. In Appendix C, we document the variation in subfield size and explore the
sensitivity of our results to alternate subfield definitions, including those that exclude potentially endogenous
intellectual linkages.
8
To facilitate the harvesting of PubMed-related records on a large scale, we have developed an open-source
software tool that queries PubMed and PMRA and stores the retrieved data in a MySQL database. The
software is available for download at http://www.stellman-greene.com/FindRelated/. Prior research
leveraging the intellectual linkages between articles generated by PMRA include Azoulay et al. (2015),
Azoulay et al. (forthcoming), and Myers (2018).

8

of these cutoff rules. Reassuringly, our results are qualitatively similar regardless of the rule
employed.
To fix ideas, consider “The transcriptional program of sporulation in budding yeast”
[PubMed ID 9784122], an article published in the journal Science in 1998 originating from the
laboratory of Ira Herskowitz, an eminent UCSF biologist who died in 2003 from pancreatic
cancer. As can be seen in Appendix Figure C4, PMRA returns 72 original related journal
articles for this source publication. Some of these intellectual neighbors will have appeared
before the source to which they are related, whereas others will have only been published after
the source. Some will represent the work of collaborators, past or present, of Herskowitz’s,
whereas others will represent the work of scientists in her field she may never have come in
contact with during her life, much less collaborated with. The salient point is that nothing
in the process through which these related articles are identified biases us towards (or away
from) articles by collaborators, frequent citers of Herskowitz’s work, or co-located researchers.
Consider now the second most-related article to Herskowitz’s Science paper listed in Figure C4, “Phosphorylation and maximal activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis-specific
transcription factor Ndt80 is dependent on Ime2.” Figure C5 in Appendix C displays the
MeSH terms that tag this article along with its source. As a byproduct, PMRA also provides a cardinal dyadic measure of intellectual proximity between each related article and
its associated source article. In this particular instance, the relatedness score of “Phosphorylation...” is 94%, whereas the relatedness score for the most distant related article in
Figure C4, “Catalytic roles of yeast...” is only 62%.
In the five years prior to his death (1998-2002), Herskowitz was the last author on 12 publications, the publications most closely associated with his position as head of a laboratory.
For each of these source publications, we treat the set of publications returned by PMRA
as constituting a distinct subfield, and we create a subfield panel dataset by counting the
number of related articles in each of these subfields in each year between 1975 and 2006. An
important implication of this data construction procedure is that the subfields we delineate
are quite limited in scope. One window into the degree of intellectual breadth for subfields
is to gauge the overlap between the articles that constitute any pair of subfields associated
with the same star. In the sample, the 452 deceased stars account for 3,076 subfields, and
21,661 pairwise combination of subfields (we are only considering pairs of subfields associated with the same individual star). Appendix Figure C6 displays the histogram for the

9

distribution of overlap, which is extremely skewed. A full half of these pairs exhibit exactly
zero overlap, whereas the mean of the distribution is 0.06. To find pairs of subfields that
display substantial amounts of overlap (for example, half of the articles in subfield 1 also
belong in subfield 2), one must reach far into the right tail of the distribution, specifically,
above the 98th percentile.
As such, the subfields we delineate are relatively self-contained. Performing the analysis
at the level of the subfield—rather than lumping together all the subfields of an individual
star—will provide us with an opportunity to exploit variation in the extent of participation
of the star within each of her subfields. We will also check the validity of the main results
when rolling the data up from the subfield level to the star level in Appendix F. Finally, since
even modest amounts of overlap entail that the observations corresponding to the subfields
of individual stars will not be independent in a statistical sense, we will cluster standard
errors at the level of the star scientist.9

3.3

Identification Strategy

Given our interests in the effect of superstar death on entry into scientific subfields, our
empirical strategy is focused on changes in published research output after the superstar
passes away, relative to when she was still alive. To ensure that we are estimating the effect
of interest and not some other influence that is correlated with the passage of time, our
specifications include age and period effects, as is the norm in studies of scientific productivity
(Levin and Stephan 1991). These temporal controls are tantamount to using subfields that
lost a superstar in earlier or later periods as an implicit control group when estimating entry
into subfields that currently experienced the death of a superstar. If the death of a superstar
only represented a one-time shift in the level of entry into the relevant subfields, this would
not be problematic. But if these unfortunate events affect trends—and not simply levels—
of scientific activity, this approach may not suffice to filter out the effect of time-varying
omitted variables, even when flexible age and calendar time controls are included in the
econometric specification. One tangible concern about time-varying effects relates to the life
cycle of subfields, where productive potential may initially increase over time before peaking
and then slowly declining.
9
The compactness of these subfields likely reflect the technology of research within the life sciences, a similar exercise performed in a different domain of science, particularly those characterized by large collaborative
projects, might well result in subfields with substantially more overlap.

10

To mitigate this threat to identification, our preferred empirical strategy relies on the
selection of a matched scientist/subfield for each treated scientist/subfield. These control
observations are culled from the universe of subfields in which superstars who do not die are
active (see Section 3.1 and Appendix D). Combining the treated and control samples enables
us to estimate the effect of superstar death in a difference-in-differences framework. Appendix
Figure D1 illustrates the procedure used to identify control subfields in the particular case
of the Herskowitz publication highlighted above.
We begin by looking at all the articles that appeared in the same journal and in the same
year as the treated source articles. From this set of articles, we keep only those that have
one of the still-living superstars in the last authorship position. Then, using a “coarsened
exact matching” procedure detailed in Appendix D, the control source articles are selected
such that (1) the number of authors in the treated and control are approximately similar;
(2) the age of the treated and control superstars differ by no more than five years; and
(3) the number of citations received by the treated and source article are similar. For the
Herskowitz/“sporulation in budding yeast” pair, we can select 10 control articles in this
way. All of these controls were also published in Science in 1998, and have between five and
seven authors. One of these controls is “Hepatitis C Viral Dynamics in Vivo...,” whose last
author is Alan Perelson, a biophysicist at Los Alamos National Lab. Perelson and Herskowitz
obtained their PhD only a year apart. The two papers had received 514 and 344 citations
respectively by the end 2003. Though this is a large difference, this places both well above
the 99th percentile of the citation distribution for 5-year old articles published in 1998.
One potential concern with the addition of this “explicit” control group is that control
subfields could be affected by the treatment of interest. What if, for instance, a control
source article happens to be related (in a PMRA sense) with the treated source? Because the
subfields identified by PMRA are narrow, this turns out to be very infrequent. Nonetheless,
we remove all such instances from the data. We then find all the intellectual neighbors for
these control source articles using PMRA; a control subfield is defined by the set of related
articles returned by PMRA, in a manner that is exactly symmetric to the procedure used
to delineate treated subfields. When these related articles are parsed below to distinguish
between those published by collaborators and non-collaborators of the star, or between
those by intellectual outsiders and insiders, covariates for treated and control observations
will always be defined with perfect symmetry.

3.4

Descriptive Statistics

The procedure described above yields a total of 34,218 distinct subfields; 3,076 subfields
correspond to one of the 452 dead scientists, whereas 31,142 subfields correspond to one of
5,809 still-living scientists. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for control and treated
subfields in the baseline year, i.e., the year of death for the deceased scientist.10
Covariate balance. In the list of variables displayed in Table 2, a number of covariates are
balanced between treated and control subfields solely by virtue of the coarsened exact matching procedure—for instance, (star) investigator year of degree, the source article number of
authors, or the source article number of citations at baseline. However, there is nothing
mechanical to explain the balance between treated and control subsamples with respect to
the stock of our main outcome variable: the number of articles in the star’s field. Figure 1
compares the distributions of the cumulative number of articles published in our sample of
subfields up to the year of death, broken down by treatment status. Overall, one can observe
a great deal of overlap between the two histograms; the means and medians are virtually
identical. Of course, balance in the levels of the outcome variable is not technically required
for the validity of the empirical exercise.11 Yet, given the ad hoc nature of the procedure
used to identify control subfields, this degree of balance is reassuring.
Another happy byproduct of our matching procedure is that treated and control scientists
also appear quite similar in the extent of their eminence at the time of (counterfactual) death,
whether such eminence is measured through NIH funding, the number of articles published,
or the number of citations these articles received.
Collaborators vs.

non-collaborators. One critical aspect of the empirical analysis

is to distinguish between collaborators and non-collaborators of the star when measuring
publishing activity in a subfield. It is therefore crucial to describe how this distinction can
be made in our data. Information about the superstars’ colleagues stems from the Faculty
Roster of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), to which we secured
licensed access for the years 1975 through 2006, and which we augmented using NIH grantee
information (cf. Azoulay et al. [2010] for more details).
10

We can assign a counterfactual year of death for each control subfield, since each control subfield is
associated with a particular treated subfield through the matching procedure described above.
11
What is required is that the trends in publication activity be comparable between treated and control
subfields up until the death of the treated scientist. We verify that this is the case below.

12

An important implication of our reliance on these sources of data is that we can only identify authors who are faculty members in U.S. medical schools, or recipients of NIH funding.
We cannot systematically identify scientists working for industrial firms, or scientists employed in foreign academic institutions.12 The great benefit of using AAMC data, however,
is that they ensure we have at our disposal both demographic and employment information
for every individual in the relevant labor market: their (career) age, type of degree awarded,
place of employment, gender, and research output, whether measured by publications or
NIH grants.
To identify authors, we match the authorship roster of each related article in one of our
subfields with the AAMC roster.13 We tag as a collaborator any author who appeared as a
co-author of the star associated with the subfield on any publication prior to the death. Each
related article is therefore assigned to one of two mutually-exclusive bins: the “collaborator”
bin comprises the set of publications with at least one identified author who coauthored
with the star prior to the year of death (or counterfactual death); the “non-collaborator”
bin comprises the set of publications with no identified author who coauthored with the star
prior to the year of death (or counterfactual death).14 As can be seen in Table 2, roughly
11% of the publication activity at baseline can be accounted for by collaborators. Moreover,
this proportion is very similar for control and treated subfields.15
A first look at subfield activity. Figure E1 in Appendix E confirms that the treated and
control subfields are on similar trajectories in publication activity up to the time of superstar
death (though they diverge after the death event). This provides suggestive evidence for the
validity of our research design, and is notable since the coarsened exact matching procedure
that generated the sample of control subfields did not make any use of these outcomes.
Moreover, the absence of differential trends can be observed for overall activity, for activity
restricted to collaborators of the star, and for the publishing activity of non-collaborators.
12

We can identify trainees who later go on to secure a faculty position, but not those who do not stay in
academia.
13
We limit ourselves to authors with relatively infrequent names. Though this may create some measurement error, there is no reason to suspect that the wrongful attribution of articles to authors will impact
treated and control subfields in a differential way.
14
We identify the publications in the subfield for which the superstar is an author and eliminate them
from these calculations. As a result, any decrease in activity within the subfield cannot be ascribed to the
mechanical effect of its star passing away.
15
We define collaboration status by looking at the authorship roster for the entire corpus of work published
by the star before or in the year of death, and not only with respect to the articles of the star that belong
to the focal subfield.

13

More boldly, we can use these averages in the raw data to examine changes in outcomes
after the death. For both treated and control subfields, the curves exhibit a pronounced
inverted U-shaped pattern, with activity first increasing until it reaches a peak roughly two
years before the death of the star (or counterfactual death for the control subfields and their
associated stars). Activity then decreases steadily, but the slope of the decrease appears
more pronounced for control subfields, relative to treated subfields (Panel A). This pattern
is flipped when examining activity due to collaborators (Panel B): the relative decline is much
more pronounced for treated subfields, which is consistent with the results in Azoulay et al.
(2010). Panel C, which focuses on subfield activity limited to non-collaborators, provides
the first non-parametric evidence that the downward-sloping part of the activity curve is less
steep for treated subfields.
Figure E1 provides a transparent illustration of subfield publication activity over time,
which proceeds directly from averaging the raw data, but the evidence it provides should be
handled with an abundance of caution. First, it conflates calendar time and experimental
time, when in actuality the death events in the data occur at varying frequencies between
the years 1975 and 2003. Second, covariates like field age are not perfectly balanced across
the treated and control groups, since the number of control subfields is not identical across
treated subfields. Finally, it abstracts away from robust inference, and particularly from
clustering: one would expect the subfield outcomes associated with an identical star to be
correlated. Our econometric framework, described below, addresses these limitations and as
a result provides a more solid foundation for the estimation of the causal effect of star death
on the dynamics of subfield activity.

Results
The exposition of the econometric results proceeds in stages. After a review of method-

ological issues, we provide results that pertain to the main effect of superstar death on
subfield growth, measured by publication rates and funding flows. Next, we attempt to
elucidate the mechanism (or set of mechanisms) at work to explain our most robust finding,
that of relative subfield growth in the wake of a star’s passing, a growth entirely accounted
for by contributions from non-collaborators. We do so by examining the characteristics of
the articles published by non-collaborators, before turning to the characteristics of their authors. We also explore heterogeneity in the treatment effect through the interaction of the
post-death indicator variable with various attributes of the stars and the subfields.

4.1

Econometric Considerations

Our estimating equation relates publication or funding activity in subfield i in year t to
the treatment effect of losing a superstar:
h
E [yit |Xit ] = exp β0 + β1 AF T ER DEAT Hit
+ β2 AF T ER DEAT Hit × T REATi + f (AGEit ) + δt + γi

i

(1)

where y is a measure of subfield activity, AF T ER DEAT H denotes an indicator variable
that switches to one in the year after the superstar associated with i passes away, T REAT
is an indicator variable for treated subfields, f (AGEit ) corresponds to a flexible function
of the field’s age, the δt ’s stand for a full set of calendar year indicator variables, and the
γi ’s correspond to subfield fixed effects, consistent with our approach to analyze changes in
activity within subfield i following the passing of a superstar.16
The subfield fixed effects control for many time-invariant characteristics that could influence research activity, such as the need for capital equipment or the extent of disease burden
(e.g., for clinical fields). A pregnant metaphor for the growth of scientific knowledge has
been that of biological evolution (Hull 1988; Chavalarias and Cointet 2013): a field is born
when new concepts are introduced, resulting in an accelerating production of “offspring”
(articles), until the underlying scientific community loses its thematic coherence, ushering in
an era of decline (or alternatively, splitting or merging events). To flexibly account for such
life cycle effects, we include subfield age indicator variables (where subfield age is computed
as the number of years since the year of publication for the source article). The calendar year
effects filter out the effects of the general expansion of the scientific enterprise as measured
by the number of journals and articles published each year.17
We follow Jaravel et al. (2018) in including in our specification an indicator for the timing
of death that is common to treated and control subfields (whose effect will be identified by the
coefficient β1 ) in addition to the effect of interest, an interaction between AF T ER DEAT H
and T REAT (whose effect will be identified by the coefficient β2 ). The effects of these two
variables are separately identified because (i) death events are staggered across our observation period and (ii) control subfields inherit a counterfactual date of death because they
16

To avoid confusion, we have suppressed any subscript for the superstars. This is without loss of generality,
since each subfield is uniquely associated with a single star.
17
It is not possible to separately identify calendar year effects from age effects in the “within subfield”
dimension of a panel in a completely flexible fashion, because one cannot observe two subfields at the same
point in time that have the same age but were born in different years (Hall et al. 2007).

15

are uniquely associated with a treated subfield through the matching procedure described
in section 3.3. The inclusion of the common term addresses the concern that age, calendar
year, and subfield fixed effects may not fully account for shifts in subfield activity around
the time of the star’s passing. If this is the case, AF T ER DEAT H will capture the corresponding transitory dynamics, while AF T ER DEAT H × T REAT will isolate the causal
effect of interest. Empirically, we find that in some specifications, the common term has
substantial explanatory power, though its inclusion does not radically alter the magnitude
of the treatment effect.
Estimation. The dependent variables of interest, including publication counts and NIH
grants awarded, are skewed and non-negative. For example, 31.40% of the subfield/year
observations in the data correspond to years of no publication activity; the figure climbs to
56.70% if one focuses on the count of NIH grants awarded. Following a long-standing tradition in the study of scientific and technical change, we present conditional quasi-maximum
likelihood (hereafter QML) estimates based on the conditional fixed effects Poisson model
developed by Hausman et al. (1984). Because the Poisson model is in the linear exponential
family, the coefficient estimates remain consistent as long as the mean of the dependent
variable is correctly specified (Gouriéroux et al. 1984).
Inference. QML (i.e., “robust”) standard errors are consistent even if the underlying data
generating process is not Poisson. In fact the Hausman et al. estimator can be used for any
non-negative dependent variables, whether integer or continuous (Santos Silva and Tenreyro
2006), as long as the variance/covariance matrix is computed using the outer product of the
gradient vector (and therefore does not rely on the Poisson variance assumption). Further,
QML standard errors are robust to arbitrary patterns of serial correlation (Wooldridge 1997),
and hence immune to the issues highlighted by Bertrand et al. (2004) concerning inference
in DD estimation. We cluster the standard errors around superstar scientists in the results
presented below.18
18
Knowledge spillovers and scientific breakthroughs, including the adoption of research tools, could encourage innovation across related fields. This possibility is not entirely dealt with by clustering inference
at the star level, since spatial dependence in knowledge space could occur between any pair of subfields,
whereas clustering only allows for dependence among the subfields associated with the same star. As it
turns out, the Poisson conditional fixed effects estimator also provides a consistent estimator of the variance
in the presence of time-invariant patterns of spatial auto-correlation (Bertanha and Moser 2016).

16

Dependent Variables. Our primary outcome variable is publication activity in a subfield.
However, we go beyond this raw measure by assigning the related articles that together
constitute the subfield into a variety of bins. For instance, we can decompose publication
activity in the subfield into two mutually exclusive subfields: articles with a superstar on
the authorship roster vs. articles without a superstar; etc. Articles in each bin can then be
counted and aggregated up to the subfield/year level.
Capturing funding flows at the field level is slightly more involved. PubMed systematically records NIH grant acknowledgements using grant numbers. Unfortunately, these grant
numbers are often truncated and omit the grant cycle information that could enable us to
pin down unambiguously the particular year in which the grant was awarded. When it is
missing, we impute the award year using the following rule: for each related publication
that acknowledges NIH funding, we identify the latest year in the three-year window that
precedes the publication during which funding was awarded through either a new award or
a competitive renewal. To measure funding activity in a subfield, we create a count variable
that sums all the awards received in particular year, where these awards ultimately generate
publications in the focal subfield.

4.2

Main effect of superstar death

Table 3 and Figure 2 present our core results. Overall, we find that publication activity
increases slightly following the death of a star scientist who was an active contributor to it,
but the magnitude of the effect is modest (about 5.2%) and imprecisely estimated (column 1).
Yet, this result conceals a striking pattern that is uncovered when we distinguish between
publications by collaborators and non-collaborators. The decline in publication activity accounted for by previous collaborators of the star is large, on the order of 20.7% (column 2).
This evidence is consistent with previous findings, which showed that coauthors of superstar scientists who die suffer a drop in output, particularly if their non-collaborative work
exhibited strong keyword overlap with the star, i.e., if they were intellectually connected in
addition to being coauthors (Azoulay et al. 2010, Table VI, column 2).
A limitation of the previous work focusing on the fate of collaborators after the loss of
an eminent scientist always lied in the failure to distinguish between social and intellectual
channels of influence, since every treated scientist was by definition a collaborator, even if
merely a casual one. In this study, we can relax this constraint, and when we do, we find that

17

relative publication activity by non-collaborators in the subfield increases by a statistically
significant 100 × (e0.082 − 1) = 8.6% (column 3).19
We also explore the dynamics of the effects uncovered in Table 3. We do so by estimating
a specification in which the treatment effect is interacted with a set of indicator variables
corresponding to a particular year relative to the superstar’s death, and then graphing the
effects and the 95% confidence interval around them (Panels A, B, and C of Figure 2 correspond to columns 1, 2, and 3 in Table 3).20
Two features of the figure are worthy of note. First, the dynamics amplify the previous results in the sense that we see the effects increasing (in absolute value) monotonically over time—there is no indication that the effects we estimated in Table 3 are merely
transitory. Five years after a star’s death, the relative increase in publication activity by
non-collaborators is large enough in magnitude to fully offset the decline in activity by collaborators. Second, there is no discernible evidence of an effect in the years leading up to
the death, a finding that validates ex post our identification strategy.
Nevertheless, the case for the exogeneity of death events with respect to the course of
knowledge growth and decline within a subfield is stronger for sudden causes of deaths than
for anticipated causes of death. Figure E2 in Appendix E provides a version of Figure 2,
Panel C (event study graphs for non-collaborators) broken down by causes of death (anticipated vs. sudden). While there is more variability in the estimated path of outcomes in the
years leading up to the death event in the anticipated case (Panel A) than in the sudden
case (Panel B), it is imprecisely estimated and non-monotonic. In both panels, however,
one can observe a slow but steady increase after the event in the rate of contributions by
non collaborators in treated subfields, relative to control subfields. The distinction between
sudden and anticipated events is explored further in section 4.4.
The last three columns of Table 3 focus on funding flows from the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) rather than publication flows. More precisely, the outcome variable in
columns 4, 5, and 6 is the number of distinct NIH awards that acknowledge a publication
in the subfield in the three-year window before the year of publication for the related article
19

The number of observations varies ever so slightly across columns because the conditional fixed effects
specification drops observations corresponding to subfields for which there is no variation in activity over
the entire observation period. This is true as well for the results reported in Tables 4 through 8.
20
In these specifications, the AF T ER DEAT H term which is common to treated and control subfields is
also interacted with a complete series of lags and leads relative to the year of death or counterfactual death.

18

(summing the financial total of grant amounts, as opposed to the number of grants, yields
similar results). The patterns are very similar to those obtained in the case of publication
activity, both in terms of magnitudes and in terms of statistical significance.

4.3

Subfield growth patterns

In the remainder of the manuscript, we seek to characterize the kind of contribution, and
the type of investigators that give rise to the novel empirical regularity we uncovered: that
of relative growth for subfields following the death of their superstar anchor, a phenomenon
entirely accounted for by research activity undertaken by scientists who never collaborated
with the star while alive. As a consequence, all the results below pertain to contributions
by non-collaborators; any article with even one author who collaborated with the star is
excluded from the count of articles that constitute the dependent variable.
The impact and direction of new research. What characterizes the additional contributions that together lead to increased activity in a subfield after a star has passed on? Are
these in fact important contributions to the subfield? Do they continue to focus on mainstream topics within the subfield, or should they be understood as taking the intellectual
domain in a novel direction? Tables 4 and 5 explore these issues.
In Table 4, we parse every related article in the subfields to assign them into one of
six mutually exclusive bins, based on their vintage-specific long-run citation impact: articles
that fall in the bottom quartile of the citation distribution; in the second quartile; in the third
quartile; articles that fall above the 75th percentile, but below the 95th percentile; articles
that fall above the 95th percentile, but below the 99th percentile; articles that fall above the
99th percentile of the citation distribution.21 Each column in Table 4 (with the exception
of the first which simply replicates the effect for all papers, regardless of impact, that was
previously displayed in Table 3, column 3) reports the corresponding estimates. A startling
result is that the magnitude of the treatment effect increases sharply and monotonically as
21

A vintage is comprised of all the articles published in a given year. When we are referring to the vintagespecific, article-level distribution of citations, the relevant universe to compute quantiles is not limited to
the articles that constitute the subfields in our data. Rather, the relevant universe includes the entire set of
17,312,059 articles that can be cross-linked between PubMed and the Web of Science. As a result, there is
no reason to suspect that individual stars, or even our entire set of stars, could ever alter the shape of these
distributions. For example, the article by Sopko et al. highlighted on Figure C5 (in Appendix C) received
40 citations from other articles in PubMed by 2015. This puts this article above the 79th percentile of the
citation distribution for articles published in 2002.

19

we focus on the rate of contributions with higher impact. In contrast, the number of lowerimpact articles contributed by non-collaborators contracts slightly, though the effect is not
precisely estimated.22
Table 5 parses the related articles in each subfield to ascertain whether contributions by
non-collaborators constitute a genuine change in intellectual direction. Panel A distinguishes
between contributions that are proximate in intellectual space to the source article from those
that are more distant (though still part of the subfield as construed by PMRA). Because
we have at our disposal both a cardinal and an ordinal measure of intellectual proximity,
we present two sets of estimates. In both cases, the magnitude of the treatment effect
pertaining to PMRA-proximate publication activity is larger, and more precisely estimated
than the magnitude corresponding to PMRA-distant publication activity (relative to the
same patterns for the control group of subfields). We can certainly rule out the conjecture
that non-collaborators enter the field from the periphery. Rather, their contributions appear
to tackle mainstream topics within the subfield.
Panel B sheds light on the intellectual direction of the field, by examining the cited
references contained in each related article. The first two columns separate related articles
in two groups: publications that cite at least some work which belongs to the subfield
identified by PMRA for the corresponding source and publications that cite exclusively out
of the PMRA subfield. Only articles in the second group appear to experience growth in the
post-death era. The next two columns proceed similarly, except that the list of references is
now parsed to highlight the presence of articles authored by the star (Column 3), as opposed
to all other authors (Column 4). We find that subfield growth can be mostly accounted for
by articles from non-collaborators who do not build on the work of the star.
Whereas Panel B highlighted the extent to which contributors were bringing new sources
of inspiration into the subfield, Panel C focuses on the extent to which the treated subfields
move closer to the scientific frontier in the wake of the superstar’s passing. The first two
columns do so by distinguishing between contributions that draw on recent versus more
22

Table E3 and Figure E3 in Appendix E break down these results further by examining separately the
growth of subfields by cause of death (anticipated vs. sudden). As mentioned earlier, the case for exogeneity
is stronger for sudden death, since when the death is anticipated, it would be theoretically possible for the star
to engage in “intellectual estate planning,” whereby particular scientists (presumably close collaborators)
are anointed as representing the next generation of leaders in the subfield. Our core results continue to
hold when analyzed separately by cause of death. However, we gain statistical power from pooling these
observations, and some empirical patterns would be estimated less precisely if we chose to focus solely on
observations corresponding to subfields for which the star died suddenly and unexpectedly.

20

dated references. This exercise is repeated in Columns 3 and 4, with a focus on the vintage
of the MeSH term combinations for each article in the subfield.23 Both sets of results indicate
that these new contributions are more likely to build on science of a more recent vintage.
Taken together, the results presented in Table 5 paint a nuanced picture of directional
change in the wake of superstar passing. The new contributions do not represent a radical
departure from the subfield’s traditional concerns (Panel A). At the same time, the citation
and MeSH evidence (Panels B and C) make it clear that these additional contributions are
more likely to draw on new-to-the-subfield as well as new-to-the-world ideas. In short, they
both rejuvenate the subfield, and alter its angular velocity by shifting its intellectual center
of gravity away from its pre-death position.
It is important to note, however, that the findings above do not imply that the published
results of entrants necessarily contradict or overturn the prevailing scientific understanding
and assumptions within a subfield. We provide indirect evidence regarding these contributions’ disruptive impact by leveraging a measure recently proposed by Funk and Owen-Smith
(2017). Their index captures the degree to which an idea consolidates or destabilizes the
status quo, by measuring whether the future ideas that build on the focal idea also rely on
its acknowledged predecessors. The results in Table E4 of Appendix E suggest that these
contributions do not radically disrupt the subfield. Rather, they appear to reflect the impact
of a myriad “small r,” permanent revolutions whereby new ideas come to the fore without
necessarily eclipsing prior approaches.
Outsiders vs. competitors. The next step of the analysis is to investigate the type of
scientists who publish the articles that account for subfield growth in the wake of a star’s
death. We examine the proximity in intellectual space between non-collaborators in the
subfield and the deceased superstar. One possibility is that non-collaborators are competitors
of the star, with much of their publication activity falling into the subfield when the star
was alive. Another possibility is that they are recent entrants into the subfield—intellectual
outsiders. To distinguish these different types of authors empirically, we create a metric of
intellectual proximity for each related author we can match to the AAMC Faculty Roster,
by computing the fraction of their publications that belongs to the star’s subfields up to
23

A two-way MeSH term combination is born in the year where an article is annotated by the keyword
pair for the first time.

21

the publication year for each related article.24 The distribution of this field overlap measure
is displayed on Panel A of Figure 3. The distribution is skewed, with a pronounced mass
point at the origin: approximately 50% of the related articles turn out to have authors with
exactly zero intellectual overlap with the star’s subfield, and another 1.24% are authored
by new scientists for whom this publication within the subfield is also their first publication
overall.
We now use this metric to gauge the extent to which the post-death publication activity
by non-collaborators (relative to the control group) can be attributed to related authors
whose outsider status falls into one of twelve separate bins. This includes one bin for new
scientists, one bin for the bottom half of the overlap distribution, one bin for every five
percentiles above the median (50th to 55th percentile, 55th to 60th percentile,. . . , 95th to 99th
percentile), as well as a top percentile bin. We then compute the corresponding measures
of subfield activity by aggregating the data up to the subfield/year level. These results are
presented graphically in Panel B of Figure 3. Each dot corresponds to the magnitude of
the treatment effect in a separate regression with the outcome variable being the number of
articles in each subfield that belong to the corresponding bin.
A striking pattern emerges. The authors driving the growth in relative publication activity following a star’s death are largely outsiders. They do not appear to have been substantially active in the subfield when the star was alive. In other words, they are predominantly
new entrants into these subfields, though not necessarily novice scientists.

4.4

The Nature of Entry Barriers

The evidence so far points to fields of deceased stars enjoying bursts of activity after
the death event. The influx of outsiders documented above suggests that stars may be
able to regulate entry into their field while alive. In this section, we attempt to uncover
the precise nature of barriers to entry into the subfields where the stars were prominent
prior to their untimely demise. Methodologically, we do so by splitting the sample of fields
across the median for a series of relevant covariates. Because there is no presumption that
death events are exogenous with respect to subfield growth and decline within the strata
24
Whenever we match more than one author on a related article, we assign to that article the highest
proximity score for any of the matched authors. Appendix E, Table E9 defines overlap with respect to all
the subfields associated with a given star, rather than simply the focal subfield. This does not alter our
conclusions.

22

delineated by these covariates, it should be clear that we will only be able to document
conditional correlations, and not causal effects in what follows.25
While it is tempting to envisage conscious effort by the stars to block entry through the
explicit control of key resources, such as funding and/or editorial goodwill (Brogaard et al.
2014; Li 2017), this explanation appears inconsistent with the facts on the ground. In the
five-year window before death, only three of our stars (out of 452) were sitting on study
sections, the funding panels that evaluate the scientific merits of NIH grant applications.
Another three were journal editors in the same time window. This handful of individuals
could not possibly drive the robust effects we have uncovered.26 If barriers to entry are not
the result of explicit control by stars, what is discouraging entry?
Goliath’s shadow. One possibility is that outsiders are simply deterred by the prospect of
challenging a luminary in the field. The existence of a towering figure may skew the costbenefit calculations from entry by outside scholars toward delay or alternative activities.
Table 6 examines this role of implicit barriers to entry by focusing on the eminence of
the star. Eminence is measured through the stars publication count, the stars cumulative
number of citations garnered up to the year of death, and the stars cumulative amount of
NIH funding. We also have a “local” measure of eminence: the star’s importance to the
field, which is defined as the fraction of papers in the subfield that have the star as an
author. Splitting the sample at the median of these measures reveals a consistent pattern
of results. Stars that were especially accomplished appear to be an important deterrent to
entry, with their passing creating a larger void for non-collaborators to fill. Rather than
directly thwarting the efforts of potential entrants, it appears that the mere presence of
a preeminent scholar is sufficient to dissuade intellectual outsiders from engaging with the
field.
Of course, the accomplishment of the star alone may not be the only factor influencing
entry. We next turn our attention to how the characteristics of the field and the star’s
coauthors may also modulate this relationship. Since entry is largely confined to those fields
that have lost an eminent star, the analysis that follows limits attention to those subfields
25

Instead of interacting the treatment effect with covariates, we prefer to estimate our benchmark specifications on subsamples corresponding to below and above the median of these covariates. For these two
approaches to yield comparable results, one would need to also saturate the specification with interaction
terms between the covariates and year/field age effects. In practice, we have found that the fixed effects
Poisson models fail to converge with this full set of interactions.
26
We verified that omitting these scientists from the sample hardly change the core results.

23

in which the most eminent among the stars were active, as measured by our citation metric
in Table 6.27
Subfield coherence. Entry into a field, even after it has lost its star, may be deterred
if the subfield appears unusually coherent to outsiders. A subfield is likely to be perceived
as intellectually coherent, when the researchers active in it agree on the set of questions,
approaches, and methodologies that propel the field forward. Alternatively, a field might be
perceived as socially coherent, when the researchers active in it form a tightly-knit clique,
often collaborating with each other, and perhaps also reviewing each other’s manuscripts.
To explore these purported barriers to subfield entry, we develop two alternative measures
of intellectual coherence, and one measure of social coherence.
Our first index of intellectual coherence leverages PMRA to capture the extent to which
articles in the subfield pack themselves into a crowded scientific neighborhood. Recall that
for each article in a subfield, we have at our disposal both a cardinal and an ordinal measure
of intellectual proximity with the source article from which all other articles in the subfield
radiate. Focusing only on the set of articles published in the subfield before the year of
death, we measure intellectual coherence as the cardinal ranking (expressed as a real number
between zero and one) for the 25th most related article in the subfield.28 According to this
metric, subfields exhibit wide variation in their degree of intellectual coherence, with a mean
and median equal to 0.60 (sd = 0.13). The second index of intellectual coherence exploits
the list of references cited in each article in the subfield before the star’s death. In the spirit
of Funk and Owen-Smith (2017), for all related articles published in the five years prior to
the star’s death, we compute the fraction of references that fall within the subfield. Our
contention is that subfields that are more self-referential will tend to dissuade outsiders from
entering. Once again, we observe meaningful variation across subfields using this second
index (mean = 0.05; sd = 0.04).
27

More precisely, Table 7 below drops from the sample subfields associated with stars who fall below the
median of cumulative citations garnered by the year of death. Results are qualitatively similar when focusing
on the most eminent stars as defined by publications or NIH funding. Table F6 in Appendix F presents the
results corresponding to the subsample of less-eminent stars.
28
The choice of the twenty fifth-ranked article is arbitrary, and also convenient. After purging from each
subfield reviews, editorials, and articles appearing in journals not indexed by WoS, 95% of the subfields
contain 25 articles or more in the period that precedes the star’s death. In those rare cases where the
number of articles is less than twenty-five, we choose as our measure of coherence the cardinal measure for
the least-proximate article in the subfield.

24

Our measure of social coherence summarizes the degree of “cliquishness” within a subfield
by computing the clustering coefficient in its coauthorship network. The clustering coefficient
is simply the proportion of closed triplets within the network, an intuitive way to measure
the propensity of scientists in the field to choose insiders as collaborators.29
Panel A of Table 7 investigates the role of these intellectual and social barriers in modulating the post-death expansion of fields. We find tentative evidence of a role for both types
of barriers, in that the magnitude of the treatment effect for coherent fields is always smaller
than the magnitude for less coherent fields, regardless of how coherence is measured. The
difference between the estimates for more or less coherent subfields does not reach statistical
significance at conventional levels. What seems notable, however, is that the magnitudes are
consistently ordered across the three measures.
Incumbent resource control. While we noted earlier that stars do not appear especially
well positioned to directly block entry through the control of key resources, it is possible
that those resources can be controlled indirectly through the influence of collaborators. If
incumbent scholars within a field serve as gatekeepers of funding and journal access, they may
be able to effectively stave off threats of entry from outsiders. The same may be implicitly
true if collaborators are the recipients of the lion’s share of funding within the field. To
assess financial gatekeeping, we use information regarding the composition of NIH funding
panels, to tabulate, for each star, the number of collaborators who were members of at least
one of these committees in the five years preceding the death of the star. We would like to
proceed in a similar fashion using the composition of editorial boards, but these data are
not easily available for the set of PubMed-indexed journals and the thirty-year time period
covered by our sample. As an alternative, we develop a proxy for editorial position based
on the number of editorials or comments written by every collaborator of the star.30 We
then sum the number of editorials written by coauthors in the five years before the death.
Together, the editorial and study section information allow us to distinguish between the
29

The clustering coefficient is based on triplets of nodes (authors). A triplet consists of three authors that
are connected by either two (open triplet) or three (closed triplet) undirected ties. The clustering coefficient
is the number of closed triplets over the total number of triplets (both open and closed, cf. Luce and Perry
[1949]).
30
We investigated the validity of this proxy as follows. In the sample of deceased superstars, every individual with five editorials or more was an editor. In a random sample of 50 superstars with no editorials
published, only one was an editor (for a field journal). Finally, among the sixteen superstars who wrote
between one and four editorials over their career, we found two whose CV indicate they were in fact editors
for a key journal in their field. We conclude that there appears to be a meaningful correlation between the
number of editorials written and the propensity to be an editor.

stars whose coauthors were in a position to channel resources towards preferred individuals
or intellectual approaches from those stars whose important coauthors had no such power.
Panel B of Table 7 presents the evidence on the role of indirect control. The results paint
a consistent, if not always statistically significant, picture. While subfield expansion is the
rule, it appears more pronounced when stars have relatively few collaborators in influential
positions, or collectively capture a smaller portion of the funding that supported research in
the subfield. Indirect control therefore appears to be a potential mechanism through which
superstars can exert influence on the evolution of their fields, even from beyond the grave.
Coauthors, either through their direct effort to keep the star’s intellectual flame alive or
simply by their sheer (financial) dominance in the field, erect barriers to entry into those
fields that prevent its rejuvenation by outsiders.
Taken together, these results suggest that outsiders are reluctant to challenge hegemonic
leadership within a field when the star is alive. They also highlight a number of factors that
constrain entry even after she is gone. Intellectual, social, and resource barriers all impede
entry, with outsiders only entering subfields whose topology offers a less hostile landscape
for the support and acceptance of “foreign” ideas.

4.5

Welfare considerations

What are the implications of our results for welfare? We approach this question with
a great deal of caution, since much of the evidence presented thus far pertains to changes
in the direction, rather than the rate, of scientific progress. Making welfare statements in
this context is tantamount to valuing the importance of the new directions in which related
authors take their fields (compared to the prior agenda inherited from the superstar), as
well as ascertaining the fate of fields that the new entrants departed, and the agenda they
otherwise might have pursued had the star remained alive. Such an exercise is fraught
with peril. Below we synthesize the results that already speak to these questions, and
provide a number of additional pieces of evidence. Together, this collage of results builds a
circumstantial case for the view that once securely ensconced at the helm of their field, stars
leverage their power for longer than a benevolent social planner might prefer.
Our earlier evidence suggests that entrants bring different and more recent ideas into the
subfields they enter to create highly impactful output (Tables 4 and 5). In Appendix E we

26

further show that the subfields that experience the largest post-death boost in activity are
those in which the star was presiding over an empire that was losing momentum in the years
immediately preceding the star’s death (Tables E5 and E8). These subfields are also those
in which the star’s close collaborators were less able to regulate entry (Table 7B).
It is important to note, however, that the additional output by entrants in treated subfields is largely offset by commensurate declines in output by the star’s collaborators (Table 3). Moreover, these new contributions appear to come at the expense of the entrants’
prior agenda. In Appendix G, we examine changes in total output at the related author
level, using a difference-in-differences set-up that parallels our analyses at the subfield level.
The results in Table G1 show that non-collaborators do not increase their overall output,
measured in terms of publications and NIH grants awarded. Since we know from our main
analysis that related authors are contributing more within the subfields of dead superstars,
the absence of changes in total output imply that this additional work is displacing work
they were doing in other subfields. Their new output replaces, at least in part, articles that
these authors would have written in other intellectual domains had the star remained alive.31
As a whole, these results imply that entrants are moving subfields in productive directions
relative to the period immediately preceding the passing of the star, but without increasing
scientific output in the aggregate.
However, the impacts in the final years of a star’s life are not necessarily indicative of their
contributions writ large. Indeed, the lofty accomplishments which earned them superstar
status suggest that their net contribution to society is likely positive. A longer view would
also recognize that the scientific journeymen of today may well become the stars of tomorrow
with a career that slowly builds to an apex of socially valuable accomplishments, that will
someday experience a similar decline (see Figure E4 in Appendix E).
One lens into this phenomenon is to examine the status of scientists that produce new
contributions in a subfield. In the first two columns of Table 8, we parse every article by
non-collaborators, distinguishing between those that have a star author from those for which
none of the authors are stars. We find that the effect is driven by related articles where none
31

We also estimate a dynamic version of these specifications and display the corresponding event studystyle graphs in Figure G1 (publication output) and Figure G2 (grant output). In general, it appears from
these figures that the total output of related authors neither expands nor contracts in the wake of a star’s
passing.

27

of the authors is particularly famous. One limitation of this dichotomy is that it fails to take
into account long-run career trajectories, since it lumps together mediocre scientists with
those that have not yet made their mark, but will do so in the future.
We can explore this dynamic by taking advantage of the fact that roughly 20% of the
eminent life scientists in our sample have a clear date attached to their accession to star
status: the year of appointment as a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator, or the year of
election to the National Academy of Science or the National Academy of Medicine. These
events mark their recipients as among the most celebrated within the superstar sample. With
this more rarefied definition of stardom, we can now distinguish between related authors who
are “never stars,” “current stars,” and “future stars.” The next three columns of Table 8 show
that future star authors are disproportionately likely to contribute to treated subfields after
the star has passed away, consistent with the idea that the outsiders of today can sometimes
turn into the stars of tomorrow—a phenomenon we refer to as the circle of academic life.
In light of these and our earlier results, we refrain from drawing any strong welfare
conclusions. An aggregate assessment of the value of stars would require us to integrate
accomplishments over the lifecourse of stars and everyone else who followed in their footsteps,
with a particular focus on the fate of the fields from which new entrants divest. That does
not leave us completely empty handed. In the next section, we offer some modest policy
recommendations that focus on accelerating idea churn in fields dominated by scientists in
the twilight of their careers.

4.6

Extensions and robustness

Appendix E presents results pertaining to extensions of the main analyses. Appendix F
provides a number of robustness checks. In the interest of space, we only call out a subset of the analyses presented therein, but we have written these appendices as stand-alone
documents, such that the interested reader can consult them for additional details.
Impact of research infrastructure needs. Our analysis is limited to the life sciences.
Though this area accounts for a large fraction of publicly funded, civilian research funding
in the United States, it is not necessarily representative of all fields of science. In particular,
some domains of research require access to expensive and specialized capital equipment.
When capital needs are large and lumpy, the evolution of subfields in the wake of an eminent

28

scientist’s death will likely depend on the institutions that govern access to the scarce capital
equipment.
Within biomedical research, large-scale clinical trials most closely—albeit imperfectly—
resemble the characteristics of capital-intensive scientific fields. These require a large infrastructure of data collection, monitoring, and management, which is why these activities are
often consolidated in large cooperative groups such as the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, the
Children’s Oncology Group, or the Framingham Heart Study. PubMed has a “publication
type” field which allows us to identify the subfields that are clinical-trial intensive (10% of
the subfields) versus those that are not (the remaining 90%). Table E6 replicates the results
of Table 3 separately for these two subsamples. Although our ability to estimate statistically
significant effects is limited by sample size, the magnitudes are very similar.
Impact of star age and experience. As explained earlier, we do not impose a strict age
cutoff for the deceased star, we merely insist that they exhibit tangible signs of research activity, such as publishing original articles, obtaining NIH grants, and training students. Among
our 452 departed superstars, the median age at death is 61, the seventy-fifth percentile 67,
and the top decile 73. How do the core results change when the scientists who passed away
at an advanced age are excluded from the sample? As can be observed in Table E7, the
subfields of stars who passed away more prematurely are responsible for most of the effect.
The effect for the fields associated with older stars is small in magnitude and imprecisely
estimated. We chose to keep these older stars in the sample because a larger sample affords us opportunities to explore mechanisms without losing power to detect nuanced effects
statistically.
Star level analyses. In Table F1, we probe the robustness of the core results presented
in Table 3 after rolling up the data to the level of the star scientist (deceased or control).
Recall that the treatment variable exhibits variation at the level of the star scientist, and
not at the level of a single subfield. In this robustness check, we lump all related articles
for each star together as if they belonged to a single subfield. The results in Table F1 are
quite similar to those in Table 3, both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance.
One exception is the coefficient on the effect of entry by collaborators, which is negative
as expected, but smaller in magnitude, relative to the corresponding coefficient in Table 3.
The corresponding event-study graphs, displayed in Figure F3, also display patterns fully
consistent with those observed for our benchmark set of results. As explained in Section 3.2,
29

we strongly prefer performing the analyses at the the subfield level, for two reasons. First,
the subfields delineated by PMRA exhibit limited overlap (see Figure C6 in Appendix C),
and as a result the within-star, between subfield variation in publication activity can be
exploited meaningfully. Second, we can track the differential position of the star across the
subfields in which she was active. The covariates that leverage these differences help us shed
light on mechanisms, as in Tables 7, E5, and E8.
Alternate functional forms. In Table F2, we examine the sensitivity of our benchmark
set of results to the choice of alternative functional forms. In the three columns to the left,
we simply use the “raw” number of articles in the subfield as the outcome, and perform
estimation by OLS. Of course, the estimates are not directly interpretable in terms of elasticities. At the mean of the data, however, the treatment effect in the third column implies
that subfield entry by non-collaborating authors expands by 0.409/3.335 = 12.26%, which
is not all that different from the 8.2% reported in Table 3. In the three columns to the
right, we report results corresponding to OLS estimation, but this time with the outcome
variables transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function (Burbidge et al. 1988). In
this case, coefficient estimates can be interpreted as elasticities, as an approximation. They
are quite similar once again to those reported in Table 3, except for the effect on entry by
collaborators, which is smaller in magnitude.

Conclusion
In this paper, we leverage the applied economist’s toolkit, together with a novel approach

to delineate the boundaries of scientific fields, to explore the effect that the passing of an
eminent life scientist exerts on the dynamics of growth—or decline—for the fields in which
she was active while alive. We find that publications and grants by scientists that never
collaborated with the star surge within the subfield, absent the star. Interestingly, this surge
is not driven by a reshuffling of leadership within the field, but rather by new entrants that
are drawn from outside of it. Our rich data on individual researchers and the nature of their
scholarship allows us provide a deeper understanding of this dynamic.
In particular, this increase in contributions by outsiders appears to tackle the mainstream
questions within the field but by leveraging newer ideas that arise in other domains. This
intellectual arbitrage is quite successful—the new articles represent substantial contributions,

30

at least as measured by long-run citation impact. Together, these results paint a picture of
scientific fields as scholarly guilds to which elite scientists can regulate access, providing them
with outsized opportunities to shape the direction of scientific advance in that space.
We also provide evidence regarding the mechanisms that enable the regulation of entry.
While stars are alive, entry appears to be effectively deterred where the shadow they cast
over the fields in which they were active looms particularly large. After their passing, we
find evidence for influence from beyond the grave, exercised through a tightly-knit “invisible
college” of collaborators (de Solla Price and Beaver 1966; Crane 1972). The loss of an elite
scientist central to the field appears to signal to those on the outside that the cost/benefit
calculations on the avant-garde ideas they might bring to the table has changed, thus encouraging them to engage. But this occurs only when the topology of the field offers a
less hostile landscape for the support and acceptance of “foreign” ideas, for instance when
the star’s network of close collaborators is insufficiently robust to stave off threats from
intellectual outsiders.
In the end, our results lend credence to Planck’s infamous quip that provides the title
for this manuscript. Yet its implications for social welfare are ambiguous. While we can
document that eminent scientists restrict the entry of new ideas and scholars into a field,
gatekeeping activities could have beneficial properties when the field is in its inception; it
might allow cumulative progress through shared assumptions and methodologies, and the
ability to control the intellectual evolution of a scientific domain might, in itself, be a prize
that spurs much ex ante risk taking. Because our empirical exercise cannot shed light on
these countervailing tendencies, we must remain guarded in drawing policy conclusions from
our results. Yet, the fact that the presence of a tutelar figurehead can freeze patterns of
participation into a scientific field increases the appeal of policies that bolster access to less
established or less well-connected investigators. Examples of such policies include caps on
the amount of funding a single laboratory is eligible to receive, “bonus points” for first-time
investigators in funding programs, emeritus awards to induce senior scientists to wind down
their laboratory activities, and double-blind refereeing policies (Kaiser 2011, Berg 2012, Deng
2015).
All of the evidence we have presented pertains to the academic life sciences. It is unclear how the lessons from that setting might apply to other fields inside the academy. In
particular, when frontier research requires access to expensive and highly-specialized capital

31

equipment—as is sometimes the case in the physical sciences—the rules governing access to
that capital are likely to favor succession by insiders. At the other end of the spectrum, more
atomistic fields where scientists generally work alone or in very small groups may evolve in
a more frictionless manner. Whether our findings apply to industrial research and development is also an open question. In that setting, the choice of problem-solving approaches
is guided by market signals (however imperfectly, cf. Acemoglu [2012]), and thus likely to
differ from those selected under the more nuanced system of pecuniary and non-pecuniary
incentives that characterizes academic research (Feynman 1999; Aghion, Dewatripont, and
Stein 2008). Assessing the degree to which our results extend to other settings, and the
reasons they might differ, represents a fruitful area for future research.

A. Distribution of Intellectual Proximity

Note: Panel A displays the distribution of overlap between the past output of related authors and each star’s subfield. For each author on a related article matched
to the AAMC Faculty Roster, we create a metric of intellectual proximity by computing the fraction of their publications that belongs to the star’s subfield.
Slightly more than half of related articles have authors with zero overlap, i.e., this related article is their first contribution to the star’s subfield. 1.24% of
related articles are authored by new scientists for whom this publication within the subfield is also their first publication overall. Using this information, we
aggregate the number of related articles in a particular subfield and in a particular year, e.g., “the number of articles in the subfield in year t that have
authors above the 95th percentile in our measure of field overlap.” In Panel B, each dot corresponds to the magnitude of the treatment effect in a separate
regression where the dependent variable is the number of articles in each subfield authored by scientists who belong to a particular bin of intellectual
proximity, as measured by field overlap above.

Note: Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total number of publications
in a subfield in a particular year (columns 1, 2, and 3), or the total number of NIH grants that acknowledge a publication in a subfield
(columns 4, 5, and 6). All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term common to both treated
and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star, to address the concern that age, year and individual fixed
effects may not fully account for trends in subfield entry around the time of death. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from
one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example, the estimates in column (3) imply that treated subfields see an increase in
the number of contributions by non-collaborators after the superstar passes away—a statistically significant 100×(exp[0.082]-1)=8.55%.
The number of observations varies slightly across columns because the conditional fixed effects specification drops observations
corresponding to subfields for which there is no variation in activity over the entire observation period.

Note: Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. In Panel A, the dependent variable
is the total number of publications by non-collaborators in a subfield in a particular year, where these
publications can either be proximate in intellectual space to the star’s source publication, or more distant (in
the PMRA sense). Since PMRA generates both a cardinal and an ordinal measure of intellectual proximity, we
parse the related articles using both measures, yielding a total of four different specifications. For the cardinal
measure, a related article is deemed proximate if its similarity score is above .58, which corresponds to the
median of relatedness in the sample. For the ordinal measure, a related article is deemed proximate if its
similarity rank is below 90, which also corresponds to the median of similarity in the sample. In Panel B, we
focus on whether the content of entrants’ contributions in the subfield change after the superstar passes away.
Each cited reference in a related article can either belong to the subfield, or fall outside of it; it can cite a
publication of the star scientist associated with the subfield, or fail to cite any of the star’s past contributions.
In Panel C, the dependent variable is the total number of publications by non-collaborators in a subfield in a
particular year, where these publications can either be “fresh” (citing young references, or being annotated by
MeSH terms of recent vintage) or stale (citing old references, or being annotated by MeSH terms of distant
vintage). All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term common
to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star. Exponentiating
the coefficients and differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example, the estimates
in the first column of Panel A imply that treated subfields see an increase in the number of PMRA-proximate
contributions by non-collaborators after the superstar passes away—a statistically significant 100×(exp[0.091]1)=9.53%. Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the level of the star scientist. †p < 0.10, *p <

Note: Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total number of publications by noncollaborators in a subfield in a particular year. Each pair of columns splits the sample across the median of a particular covariate for the sample of fields
(treated and control) in the baseline year. The table examines differences in the extent to which the eminence of the star at death (respectively
counterfactual year of death for controls) influences the rate at which non-collaborators enter the field after the star passes away. Eminence is measured
through the star’s cumulative number of publications, the star’s cumulative number of citations garnered up to the year of death, and the star’s cumulative
amount of NIH funding. We also have a “local” measure of eminence: the star’s importance to the field, which is defined as the proportion of articles in
the subfield up to the year of death for which the star is an author. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as
a term common to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star. Exponentiating the coefficients and
differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example, the estimate in the second column implies that treated subfields see an
increase in the number of contributions by non-collaborators after the superstar passes away—a statistically significant 100×(exp[0.116]-1)=12.30%.

Note: Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total number of publications by noncollaborators in a subfield in a particular year. The sample is limited to the subfields in which the most eminent among the stars were active
(specifically, above the median of the “cumulative citations up to the year of death” metric). Each pair of columns splits the sample across the median
of a particular covariate for the sample of subfields (treated and control) in the baseline year. For example, the first two columns of Panel B compare
the magnitude of the treatment effect for stars whose collaborators have written an above-median number of editorials in the five years preceding the
superstar’s death, vs. a below-median number of editorials. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term
common to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing
from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For example, the estimates in the first column of Panel B imply that treated subfields see an
increase in the number of contributions by non-collaborators after the superstar passes away—a statistically significant 100×(exp[0.147]-1)=15.84%.

Note: Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total number of publications by
non-collaborators in a subfield in a particular year, where these publications have scientists on their authorship roster with certain demographic
characteristics. The first two columns examine the differential effect of the publications in the subfield having a star author vs. no star author.
We rely on our home-grown definition of star—a fixed universe of 12,935 individuals that are in some sense “born” as stars. In the next two
columns, we focus on two of our metrics of stardom: becoming a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator and or becoming a member of the
National Academy of Science/Medicine. At a given point of time, every related author either (i) is already a member of this rarefied elite; (ii)
will be member of it in the future; or (iii) will never become a member of it, and this taxonomy provides a basis to split the output of each
subfield into three non-overlapping categories in each year. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as
a term common to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star. Exponentiating the coefficients

see an increase in the number of contributions by non-stars after the superstar passes away—100×(exp[0.103]-1)=10.85%.

Appendix A:
Criteria for Delineating the Set of 12,935 “Superstars”
Highly Funded Scientists. Our first data source is the Consolidated Grant/Applicant File (CGAF) from
the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). This dataset records information about grants awarded to
extramural researchers funded by the NIH since 1938. Using the CGAF and focusing only on direct costs
associated with research grants, we compute individual cumulative totals for the decades 1977-1986, 19871996, and 1997-2006, deflating the earlier years by the Biomedical Research Producer Price Index. We also
recompute these totals excluding large center grants that usually fund groups of investigators (M01 and P01
grants). Scientists whose totals lie above the 95th percentile of e‘ither distribution constitute our first group
of superstars. In this group, the least well-funded investigator garnered $10.5 million in career NIH funding
and the most well-funded $462.6 million.i
Highly Cited Scientists. Despite the preeminent role of the NIH in the funding of public biomedical
research, the above indicator of “superstardom” biases the sample towards scientists conducting relatively
expensive research. We complement this first group with a second composed of highly cited scientists
identified by the Institute for Scientific Information. A Highly Cited listing means that an individual was
among the 250 most cited researchers for their published articles between 1981 and 1999, within a broad
scientific field.ii
Top Patenters. We add to these groups academic life scientists who belong in the top percentile of the
patent distribution among academics—those who were granted 17 patents or more between 1976 and 2004.
Members of the National Academy of Science and of the Institute of Medicine. We add to
these groups academic life scientists who were elected to the National Academy of Science or the Institute
of Medicine between 1970 and 2013.
MERIT Awardees of the NIH. Initiated in the mid-1980s, the MERIT Award program extends funding for up to 5 years (but typically 3 years) to a select number of NIH-funded investigators “who have
demonstrated superior competence, outstanding productivity during their previous research endeavors and
are leaders in their field with paradigm-shifting ideas.” The specific details governing selection vary across
the component institutes of the NIH, but the essential feature of the program is that only researchers holding
an R01 grant in its second or later cycle are eligible. Further, the application must be scored in the top
percentile in a given funding cycle. We add to this category the NIH Director’s Pioneer Awardees. Part
of the “High-Risk, High-Reward Research” program, since 2004 the award has supported “scientists with
outstanding records of creativity pursuing new research directions to develop pioneering approaches to major
challenges in biomedical and behavioral research.”
Former and current Howard Hughes Medical Investigators (HHMIs). Every three years, the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute selects a small cohort of mid-career biomedical scientists with the potential
to revolutionize their respective subfields. Once selected, HHMIs continue to be based at their institutions,
i
We perform a similar exercise for scientists employed by the intramural campus of the NIH. These scientists are not eligible
to receive extramural funds, but the NIH keeps records of the number of “internal projects” each intramural scientist leads. We
include in the elite sample the top five percentiles of intramural scientists according to this metric.
ii
The relevant scientific fields in the life sciences are microbiology, biochemistry, psychiatry/psychology, neuroscience, molecular biology & genetics, immunology, pharmacology, and clinical medicine.

typically leading a research group of 10 to 25 students, postdoctoral associates and technicians. Their
appointment is reviewed every five years, based solely on their most important contributions during the
cycle.iii
Early career prize winners. We also included winners of the Pew, Searle, Beckman, Rita Allen, and
Packard scholarships for the years 1981 through 2000. Every year, these charitable foundations provide seed
funding to between 20 and 40 young academic life scientists. These scholarships are the most prestigious
accolades that young researchers can receive in the first two years of their careers as independent investigators.
Consolidated categories. Why use 8 different criteria to delineate the set of stars? There are two reasons
to do so. First, there is of course no agreed-upon definition of stardom in academic science, and choosing
an eclectic set of metric makes it less likely that our analysis will be biased by the idiosyncrasies of any
particular metric. For example, the funding metric will tend to bias the set of stars towards scientists doing
relatively expensive research (e.g., clinical research, or research on monkeys/other mammals vs. research
on invertebrates such as the nematode worm c. elegans). Table A1 documents the overlap between each of
the eight metrics. Some metrics are highly negatively correlated (e.g., ECPW and high NIH funding) while
most correlations between individual metrics are modest in magnitude.
Second, if we focused on a single, incontrovertible metric such as election to the National Academy of
Sciences, we would not have enough statistical power to identify the main effect of death on subfield growth.
To examine the effect of star death across stars of different types, we consolidate the eight metrics into three
mutually exclusive categories:
(i) “Cumulative stars,” who enter the sample on the basis of cumulative achievement (high NIH grant receipt, highly cited scientists, top patenters, and members of the National Academy of Science/Medicine
(N = 6, 858 or 53%);
(ii) “Shooting stars,” who enter the sample on the basis of a specific contribution (appointment as a
Howard Hughes Medical Investigator; NIH MERIT/Director Pioneer awardees; Early career prize
winners), with no presumption that this mark of elevated status will endure over the entire career
(N = 3, 859 or 30%);
(iii) “Cumulative⊕Shooting stars,” who enter the sample based on at least one cumulative metric, and at
least one “burst” metric (N = 2, 218 or 17%).
We also create a subsample limited to the members of the National Academies of Science/Medicine and
Investigators of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. One can think of this rarefied subset (which de facto
subsumes Nobel prize winners and Lasker awardees) as “the elite within the elite” of academic biomedical
research (N=3,325 or 26% of the total).
In Table A2, we run our benchmark specification (number of papers in the field by non-collaborators, as in the
third column of Table 3) separately on these four subsamples. All the coefficients are positive in magnitude,
but some of them are imprecisely estimated. Table A3 lists all of the 452 extinct stars in the sample, along
with basic demographic information, cause of death, institutional affiliation, and a short description of their
research expertise.

Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the
total number of publications by non-collaborators in a subfield in a particular year, contributed by noncollaborators. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term
common to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star, to
address the concern that age, year and individual fixed effects may not fully account for trends in subfield entry
around the time of death for the deceased star. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield
numbers interpretable as elasticities.

Appendix B: Linking Scientists with their Journal Articles
The source of our publication data is PubMed, a bibliographic database maintained by the U.S. National
Library of Medicine that is searchable on the web at no cost.iv PubMed contains over 14 million citations
from 4,800 journals published in the United States and more than 70 other countries from 1950 to the present.
The subject scope of this database is biomedicine and health, broadly defined to encompass those areas of
the life sciences, behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and bioengineering that inform research in healthrelated fields. In order to effectively mine this publicly-available data source, we designed PubHarvester,
an open-source software tool that automates the process of gathering publication information for individual
life scientists (see Azoulay et al. 2006 for a complete description of the software). PubHarvester is fast,
simple to use, and reliable. Its output consists of a series of reports that can be easily imported by statistical
software packages.
This software tool does not obviate the two challenges faced by empirical researchers when attempting
to accurately link individual scientists with their published output. The first relates to what one might
term “Type I Error,” whereby we mistakenly attribute to a scientist a journal article actually authored by
a namesake; The second relates to “Type II error,” whereby we conservatively exclude from a scientist’s
publication roster legitimate articles:
Namesakes and popular names. PubMed does not assign unique identifiers to the authors of the
publications they index. They identify authors simply by their last name, up to two initials, and an optional
suffix. This makes it difficult to unambiguously assign publication output to individual scientists, especially
when their last name is relatively common.
Inconsistent publication names. The opposite danger, that of recording too few publications, also looms
large, since scientists are often inconsistent in the choice of names they choose to publish under. By far the
most common source of error is the haphazard use of a middle initial. Other errors stem from inconsistent
use of suffixes (Jr., Sr., 2nd, etc.), or from multiple patronyms due to changes in spousal status.
To deal with these serious measurement problems, we opted for a labor-intensive approach: the design of
individual search queries that relies on relevant scientific keywords, the names of frequent collaborators,
journal names, as well as institutional affiliations. We are aided in the time-consuming process of query
design by the availability of a reliable archival data source, namely, these scientists’ CVs and biosketches.
PubHarvester provides the option to use such custom queries in lieu of a completely generic query (e.g,
"azoulay p"[au] or "graff zivin js"[au]). As an example, one can examine the publications of Scott A.
Waldman, an eminent pharmacologist located in Philadelphia, PA at Thomas Jefferson University. Waldman
is a relatively frequent name in the United States (with 208 researchers with an identical patronym in the
AAMC faculty roster); the combination "waldman s" is common to 3 researchers in the same database.
A simple search query for "waldman sa"[au] OR "waldman s"[au] returns 377 publications at the time
of this writing. However, a more refined query, based on Professor Waldman’s biosketch returns only 256
publications.v
The above example also makes clear how we deal with the issue of inconsistent publication names. PubHarvester gives the end-user the option to choose up to four PubMed-formatted names under which
publications can be found for a given researcher. For example, Louis J. Tobian, Jr. publishes under "tobian
l", "tobian l jr", and "tobian lj", and all three names need to be provided as inputs to generate a
complete publication listing. Furthermore, even though Tobian is a relatively rare name, the search query
needs to be modified to account for these name variations, as in ("tobian l"[au] OR "tobian lj"[au]).

Appendix C: PubMed Related Citations Algorithm [PMRA]
Algorithm overview. The PubMed Related Citations Algorithm [PMRA] underlies the “related articles”
search feature in PubMed. Lin and Wilbur (2007) develop a topic-based similarity model designed to help
a typical user search through the literature by presenting a set of records topically related to a focal article
returned by a PubMed search query.
Specifically, PMRA relies on Bayes’ Theorem to estimates the probability that an individual is interested in
document a given expressed interest in document b. They focus on the following relationship:
Pr(a|b) ∝

N
X

Pr(a|sj ) Pr(b|sj ) Pr(sj ),

j=1

where {s1 , ..., sN } denotes the entire set of mutually exclusive topics that could possibly be contained within
a, b, or any other document of interest. Lin and Wilbur (2007) then make assumptions about the underlying
arrival rates of terms within documents and how likely the occurrence of a term within a document actually
reflects the true nature of that document. From these assumptions, the authors arrive at a topic weighting
function, wj,x , that describes how important a topic sj is to any document x, and a document scoring
function, Sim(a, b), that quantifies the similarity between a and b, given by:
s
1
wj,x =λj,x ×
fj
Sim(a, b) =

N
X

wj,a × wj,b ,

j=1

where fj is the frequency of topic sj in the entire corpus and λj,x is based on a series of Poisson arrival
rate parameters and the number of times topic sj occurs within document x. Intuitively, two documents
are more likely to be similar when they both use topics that are rare (fj is low) many times (λj,x is high).
The authors estimate, optimize and experimentally confirm parameters to align with human assessments.
They also report that one fifth of “non-trivial” browser sessions in PubMed invoke PMRA at least once,
providing some “ground truth” for the view that the algorithm captures meaningful intellectual linkages
between documents.
Defining topics. The algorithm relies on three types of text information to derive a list of potential topics:
MeSH terms, abstract words, and title words. MeSH is the National Library of Medicine’s [NLM] controlled
vocabulary thesaurus. It consists of terms arranged in a hierarchical structure that permit searching at
various levels of specificity (there are over 28,000 descriptors in the 2018 edition of MeSH). Almost every
publication in PubMed is tagged with a set of MeSH terms (between 1 and 103 in the current edition of
PubMed, with both the mean and median approximately equal to 11). NLM’s professional indexers are
trained to select indexing terms from MeSH according to a specific protocol, and consider each article in the
context of the entire collection (Bachrach and Charen 1978; Névéol et al. 2010).
The presence of MeSH terms is crucial for the performance of the PMRA algorithm in two separate respects.
Directly, because the MeSH terms are appended to the list of abstract words and title words to form the set
of topics present in a PubMed record. Indirectly, because PMRA uses MeSH terms as informative markers
to separate “elite” from “non-elite” topics in each record, and relies on a mixture of two Poisson distributions
(one for elite terms, one for non-elite terms) to estimate the probability that a document is about a topic,
given that we observe its corresponding term (abstract word, title word, MeSH term) a certain number of
times in the document.
The reliance of PMRA on MeSH terms offers both advantages and disadvantages from the standpoint of our
study. On the positive side of the ledger, professional indexers with domain expertise annotate articles with

xi

MeSH terms—the authors are not involved. Professional annotators are probably less subject than authors
to demand effects, whereby keywords are chosen endogenously to appeal to an audience of potential readers,
referees, and journal editors. As such, they are relatively more stripped of “social baggage” than authorchosen keywords would be.vi Research in information science backs up the claim that MeSH terms can be
seen as representing standardized and high-quality summaries of a particular publication (Bhattacharya et
al. 2011).
On the negative side of the ledger, two features of the MeSH annotation process deserve mention. First,
MeSH terms suffer from a keyword vintage problem as well as a left-censoring problem; these two problems
are inextricably linked. Indexers may have available a lexicon of permitted keywords which is itself out
of date. NLM continually revises and updates the MeSH vocabulary in an attempt to neutralize keyword
vintage effects, but articles are not systematically backward-annotated. Take, for example the paper by
Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna which appeared in Science in June 2012 (Jinek et al., “A
programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity”) and established the
viability of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for genome editing. The article is tagged by 11 unique MeSH terms,
but CRISPR is not one them. This is of course because the CRISPR keyword was not part of the controlled
MeSH thesaurus in 2012—it was “born” as a keyword in 2013!
Second, human indexers are not necessarily impervious to scientific fads and fashions. In their efforts to be
helpful to PubMed users, they may use combinations of keywords that reflect the conventional views of the
field. Probabilistic topic models such as PMRA assume that the scientific corpus has been correctly indexed.
But what if the indexers who chose the keywords brought their own “conceptual baggage” to the indexing
task, so that the pictures that emerge from this process are more akin to their conceptualization than to
those of the scientists whose work it was intended to study? In our view, “indexer effects” (in the parlance
of Whittaker 1989) present a more benign challenge. A number of studies have asked authors to validate ex
post the quality of the keywords selected by independent indexers, with generally encouraging results (Law
and Whittaker 1992). Inter-indexer reliability is also very high (Wilbur 1998).
There is an additional reason why these challenges deserve less emphasis than might appear at first blush,
at least from the standpoint of accurately capturing intellectual relatedness. PMRA relies on abstract words
and title words as well as MeSH terms. Going back to the Jinek et al. (2012) article, the word “CRISPR”
appears four separate times in the abstract. PMRA can therefore link this foundational paper to 218
other articles, which will often be annotated with CRISPR-relevant MeSH terms (e.g., “CRISPR-Associated
Proteins” or “CRISPR-Cas Systems.”) In other words, the inclusion of title/abstract words help remedy
unpleasant features of the MeSH annotation process. In so doing, however, they weaken our initial claim
that the linkages revealed by PMRA are purely intellectual, devoid of “social baggage.” For this reason,
below we will explicitly look at the extent to which omitting abstract and title words from the input used by
PMRA to generate the list of intellectual neighbors alters our benchmark set of results. Figure C1 depicts
how the multiplier of the unconditional probability that two articles are related through PMRA is affected
by the number of MeSH terms that overlap between the two records. For example, two articles picked at
random are 255 times more likely to be related if they share 5 MeSH terms instead of only one. Note that
the baseline unconditional probability that two articles are related when they share only one MeSH term is
quite low, on the order of 1 ÷ 1, 000, 000.
Implementation details. Using the MeSH keywords as input, PMRA essentially defines a distance concept
in idea space such that the proximity between a source article and any other PubMed-indexed publication
can be assessed. The following paragraphs were extracted from a brief description of PMRA:
The neighbors of a document are those documents in the database that are the most similar to it. The similarity between documents is measured by the words they have in common, with some adjustment for document
lengths. To carry out such a program, one must first define what a word is. For us, a word is basically an
vi

Importantly, the assignment of MeSH keywords does NOT take into account references cited in the publication.

xii

unbroken string of letters and numerals with at least one letter of the alphabet in it. Words end at hyphens,
spaces, new lines, and punctuation. A list of 310 common, but uninformative, words (also known as stopwords)
are eliminated from processing at this stage. Next, a limited amount of stemming of words is done, but no
thesaurus is used in processing. Words from the abstract of a document are classified as text words. Words
from titles are also classified as text words, but words from titles are added in a second time to give them a
small advantage in the local weighting scheme. MeSH terms are placed in a third category, and a MeSH term
with a subheading qualifier is entered twice, once without the qualifier and once with it. If a MeSH term is
starred (indicating a major concept in a document), the star is ignored. These three categories of words (or
phrases in the case of MeSH) comprise the representation of a document. No other fields, such as Author or
Journal, enter into the calculations.
Having obtained the set of terms that represent each document, the next step is to recognize that not all words
are of equal value. Each time a word is used, it is assigned a numerical weight. This numerical weight is
based on information that the computer can obtain by automatic processing. Automatic processing is important
because the number of different terms that have to be assigned weights is close to two million for this system.
The weight or value of a term is dependent on three types of information: 1) the number of different documents
in the database that contain the term; 2) the number of times the term occurs in a particular document; and
3) the number of term occurrences in the document. The first of these pieces of information is used to produce
a number called the global weight of the term. The global weight is used in weighting the term throughout the
database. The second and third pieces of information pertain only to a particular document and are used to
produce a number called the local weight of the term in that specific document. When a word occurs in two
documents, its weight is computed as the product of the global weight times the two local weights (one pertaining
to each of the documents).
The global weight of a term is greater for the less frequent terms. This is reasonable because the presence of a
term that occurred in most of the documents would really tell one very little about a document. On the other
hand, a term that occurred in only 100 documents of one million would be very helpful in limiting the set of
documents of interest. A word that occurred in only 10 documents is likely to be even more informative and
will receive an even higher weight.
The local weight of a term is the measure of its importance in a particular document. Generally, the more
frequent a term is within a document, the more important it is in representing the content of that document.
However, this relationship is saturating, i.e., as the frequency continues to go up, the importance of the word
increases less rapidly and finally comes to a finite limit. In addition, we do not want a longer document to be
considered more important just because it is longer; therefore, a length correction is applied.
The similarity between two documents is computed by adding up the weights of all of the terms the two documents have in common. Once the similarity score of a document in relation to each of the other documents in
the database has been computed, that document’s neighbors are identified as the most similar (highest scoring)
documents found. These closely related documents are pre-computed for each document in PubMed so that
when one selects Related Articles, the system has only to retrieve this list. This enables a fast response time
for such queries.vii

For a given source article, PMRA yields the following output: (i) an ordered list of intellectually related
articles with a fixed length; (ii) a cardinal measure of distance between the source and each related article,
which we have normalized such that a source is always 100% related to itself, and relatedness decreases as
one goes down the ranking of the ordered list of neighbors.
Cutoff Rules. The algorithm uses a cutoff rule to determine the number of related articles associated with a
given source article. First, the 100 most related records by similarity score are returned. Second, a reciprocity
rule is applied to this list of 100 records: if publication x is related to publication y, publication y must also
be related to publication x. As a result, there is no fixed number of related articles for a source article. On
the contrary, the total number of related articles can be of arbitrary large size, and certainly much higher
than 100. Figure C2, Panel A displays the histogram for the distribution of the number of related articles
for the 35,409 source articles in our main sample. The mean number of articles is 153 and the median 119.
Surprisingly, however, 25% or so of the source articles have less than 100 related articles associated with
them. In part, this is an artefact of some data construction choices, as we eliminate related articles outside
the [1965; 2006] date range, or related articles that are not original articles (reviews, editorials, etc.), or
related articles in journals not indexed by the Web of Science. And yet, even after accounting for these
vii

xiii

factors, slightly more than 10% of the source articles have less than 100 intellectual neighbors, which is
surprising given the documented cutoff rule whereby PMRA supposedly always starts from a list of 100
neighbors, and then possibly add to this list via symmetry.
We investigated this peculiar feature of the data; PMRA appears to have a second cutoff rule based on the
cardinal relatedness score. For each source article, we computed the minimum relatedness score, and graphed
the resulting distribution (Figure C2, Panel B). One can observe a mass point around 0.10 (corresponding
to 3% of the source articles), meaning that PMRA will fail to expand the set of neighbors all the way up to
100 articles if it finds out that doing so would mean including related articles with relatedness < 0.10.viii
The presence of this second cutoff is in an important respect a welcome (if idiosyncratic and poorly documented) feature of the algorithm. If the cutoff was downward-rigid at 100, then after a star scientist had
passed away, PMRA would need to reach into a set of articles that are in fact quite intellectually distant
from the source to fill the void mechanically induced by the fact that the deceased star cannot contribute
to his own subfields. Figure C2, Panel C confirms that it is not the case. It depicts, for both treated and
control source articles, the distribution of relatedness score for the least related article associated with each
source article, only taking into account the articles written after the death (or counterfactual death) of the
star. The two distributions are quite close to one another; if anything, there are slightly more control source
articles that lie at the cardinal cutoff value of 0.10, relative to treated source articles. In other words, we find
no evidence of “overexpansion” in less proximate intellectual domains for treated fields, relative to control
fields, in the period that follows the death of an eminent scientist.
One final check is to look for stability over time, both for the ordinal cutoff and the cardinal cutoff. A
maintained assumption for our research design is that these cutoffs do not vary over time differentially for
treated and control fields. We investigate cutoff stability by running a regression of each subfield’s log size
(respectively, each subfield’s log odds of the lowest relatedness score) onto journal effects, number of authors
effects, 36 source publication year effects (from 1967 to 2002, 1966 is the omitted variable), and 36 source
publication year by treatment status interaction terms. We graph the coefficient estimates corresponding to
these interaction effects on Figure C3, which are for the most part imprecisely estimated zeros, and do not
exhibit any specific upward or downward trend. From all these analysis, we conclude that there is no reason
to suspect that PMRA’s cutoff rules impact treated and control source articles in a differential way.
From source article to subfield: An Example. Given our set of source articles, we delineate the
scientific fields to which they belong by focusing on the set of articles returned by PMRA that satisfy three
additional constraints: (i) they are original articles (as opposed to editorials, comments, reviews, etc.); (ii)
they were published in or before 2006 (the end of our observation period); and (iii) they appear in journals
indexed by the Web of Science (so that follow-on citation information can be collected). In Figure C4, we
illustrate the use of PMRA with an example taken from our sample. Consider “The transcriptional program
of sporulation in budding yeast” (PubMed ID #9784122), an article published in the journal Science in
1998 originating from the laboratory of Ira Herskowitz, an eminent UCSF biologist who died in 2003 from
pancreatic cancer. PMRA returns 72 original related journal articles for this source publication.ix Some
of these intellectual neighbors appeared before the source to which they are related, whereas others were
published after the source. Some represent the work of collaborators, past or present, of Herskowitz’s,
whereas others represent the work of scientists in his field he may never have come in contact with during
his life, much less collaborated with. The salient point is that nothing in the process through which these
related articles are identified biases us towards (or away from) articles by collaborators, frequent citers of
viii

There is a smattering of source articles for which the minimum relatedness is below 0.10. Upon closer examination, these
source articles have no abstracts in PubMed, or do not have MeSH terms available. We investigated the sensitivity of our main
results to dropping these subfields from the analysis (Appendix E, Table Ex).
ix
Why exactly 72? In fact, PMRA lists 152 “intellectual neighbors” for PubMed ID 9784122. But once we exclude articles
published after 2006 (the end of our observation period), purge from the list reviews, editorials and other miscellaneous “nonoriginal” content, and drop a handful of articles that appeared in minor journals not indexed in Thomson-Reuter’s Web of
Science, the number of publications associated with this source article indeed drops to 72.

xiv

Herskowitz’s work, or co-located researchers. Rather, the only determinants of relatedness are to be found
in the overlap in MeSH keywords between the source and its potential neighbors.
PubMed ID #9784122 appeared in the October 23rd 1998 issue of the journal Science and lists 15 MeSH terms
and 5 substances. Consider now its second most-related (listed in Figure C1), PubMed ID #12242283 “Phosphorylation and maximal activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis-specific transcription factor Ndt80 is
dependent on Ime2.” It appeared in Molecular and Cell Biology in October of 2002 and has 24 MeSH terms
(resp. 11 substances). Figure C5 displays the MeSH terms that tag this article along with its source PubMed
ID #9784122. The keywords that overlap exactly have been highlighted in dark blue; those whose close ancestors in the MeSH keyword hierarchical tree overlap have been highlighted in light blue. These terms
include common terms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Transcription Factors as well as more
specific keywords including NDT80 protein, S cerevisiae and Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal.
PMRA also provides a cardinal dyadic measure of intellectual proximity between each related article and its
associated source article. In this particular instance, the relatedness score of “Phosphorylation...” is 94%,
whereas the relatedness score for the most distant related article in Figure C4, “Catalytic roles of yeast...”
is only 62%.
Delineating subfields. In the five years prior to his death (1998-2002), Herskowitz was the last author on
12 publications, the publications most closely associate with his position as head of a laboratory. For each
of these source publications, we treat the set of publications returned by PMRA as constituting a distinct
subfield, and we create a subfield panel dataset by counting the number of related articles in each of these
subfields in each year between 1975 and 2006.
An important characteristic of the subfields subfields generated by this procedure is that they correspond to
quite compact intellectual neighborhoods. One window into the extent of intellectual breadth for PMRAgenerated subfields is to gauge the overlap between the articles that constitute any pair of subfields associated
with the same star. In the sample, the 452 deceased stars account for 3,076 subfields, and 21,661 pairwise
combination of subfields (we are only considering pairs of subfields associated with the same individual
star). Figure C6 displays the histogram for the distribution of overlap, which is extremely skewed. A full
half of these pairs exhibit exactly zero overlap, whereas the mean of the distribution is 0.06. To find pairs
of subfields that display substantial amounts of overlap (for example, half of the articles in subfield 1 also
belong in subfield 2), one must reach far into the right tail of the distribution, specifically, above the 98th
percentile.
Given a source article published in year t, PMRA will tend to find the largest number of neighbors contemporaneously, slightly fewer neighbors–but still a large proportion of them all–during years t − 1 and t + 1, a
slightly lower number still in years t − 2 and t + 2, etc. In other words, PMRA creates lists of intellectual
neighbors such that, when rolled up at the year level, will generate subfields whose life cycle has an inverted
U-shape, with the peak of the U corresponding to the year of publication for the source. This does not strike
us as an implausible feature of the scientific process: papers related to a focal one will be more likely to
appear in close temporal proximity with it. Importantly, this feature of PMRA affects treated and control
subfields in a precisely symmetric fashion.
To illustrate this empirically, we took a random sample of 5,000 articles in PubMed (original articles, in
journals indexed by web of science, that appeared between 1965 and 2003–the same range of years as for
our source articles) and computed the average number of articles entering those subfields in a range of
[−10; +10] years after the publication of the source. This yields a pronounced inverted-U shape, as seen on
Figure C7. Interestingly, the decay in the outer years is not symmetric: PMRA finds more neighbors in the
future than in the past. This may reflect the steadily expanding universe of publications, such that there
will mechanically be more candidates to be included as related neighbors going forward in time, relative to
going backward in time. The same tendency would of course apply equally to control and treated subfields.

xv

Robustness checks. The production version of PMRA is used by thousands of scientists every day to assist
their search of the biomedical literature. The foregoing discussion has shown that some idiosyncrasies baked
into the algorithm are not necessarily desirable from a research standpoint. How would our benchmark set
of results change, for instance, if the subfields were expanded in size? Or if a cardinal cutoff rule determined
the boundary of a subfield? Or if only MeSH terms, rather than the combination of MeSH terms and
abstract/title words, were used to assess the similarity between the documents in a subfield? Below, we avail
ourselves to an off-line version of PMRA that was explicitly built to allow some limited experimentation with
featured of the PMRA algorithm.x Using this software tool, we can generate the relatedness score between
a source article in PubMed and a string of text. We manipulate that string of text to generate relatedness
scores between our source articles and an expanded set of candidate related articles under different scenarios.
Before doing so, however, we need to create an expanded list of “candidate” related articles, because we lack
the computing power to check each source article against the entire PubMed corpus.xi Our approach is to
combine the related articles (denoted P M RA1 articles below) with the related articles of the related articles
(denoted P M RA2 articles below) as the candidate set. Using the cardinal relatedness score generated by the
off-line, tunable version of the software, we then use a simple cutoff rule to delineate the expanded subfields:
we retain only those articles with cardinal relatedness score greater than 0.20 (the median). In addition,
as is the case for the benchmark set of subfields, we also eliminate non-original articles, articles that fall
outside of our date range, articles not written in English, and articles that appear in journals not indexed
by the Web of Science. We repeat this exercise, except that we set loose the tunable version of PMRA on
candidate related articles that are summarized solely by their MeSH terms (i.e., abstract/title words are not
taken into account).
Figure C8 displays the histogram of the distribution for subfields constructed using this novel set of rules.
The mean stands at 891 articles, the median at 625 articles, with a maximum value of 7,112. These subfields
are therefore much larger than those generated by the production version of PMRA. Table C1 replicates
our benchmark set of specifications (columns 1, 2, and 3 of Table 3) on these new data. The leftmost
three columns correspond to the version where abstract/title words and MeSH terms are used to calculate
relatedness score; the rightmost three columns correspond to the version where the input into the calculation
of relatedness is limited to the MeSH terms. The magnitudes of the effects are a bit larger than those observed
in Table 3; the coefficients are also more precisely estimated. Figure C9 replicates Panel C of Figure 2 on
the new data. Panel A of Figure C9 corresponds to a dynamic version of the specification in column (3) of
Table C1, whereas Panel B of Figure C9 corresponds to a dynamic version of the specification in column (6) of
Table C1. In both of these pictures, there appear to be a slight pre-trend in that activity in the field picks up
slightly before the death of the star scientist. The magnitudes, however, are very small, marginally significant,
and substantially smaller than those found in the post-death period, providing reassurance regarding the
robustness of our core results.

We thank Kyle Myers from the NBER for graciously allowing us access to this software, which forms the basis of his
manuscript entitled “The Elasticity of Science” (Myers 2018). Note that it relies on a version of PubMed that is not complete—
about 10% of the online version of the database have no counterparts in the off-line version, but these articles appear to be

Note: Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total
number of publications in a subfield in a particular year (similar to Table 3, columns 1 through 3). All models
incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term common to both treated and
control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star, to address the concern that age, year
and individual fixed effects may not fully account for trends in subfield entry around the time of death for the
deceased star. The first three columns use subfields that comprise both PMRA1 and PMRA2 articles, but where
the input data includes abstract/title words plus MeSH terms, just as in the production version of the algorithm.
In contrast, in the second set of three columns, subfields have been constructed while ignoring abstract/title
words for the candidate related articles. Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the level of the star
scientist. †p < 0.10, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Figure C1: MeSH Term Overlap & Relatedness

Note: This figure depicts the relationship between MESH term overlap
and being classified as related by PMRA based on a random
sample of approximately 130 million article pairs in PubMed
(formed from a random sample of 15,400 individual articles).
With exactly one MeSH term in common, the base probability of
being related is on the order of 1/1,000,000. That probability
increases extremely steeply as the number of MeSH terms shared
between any two random articles moves beyond 4 terms in
common.

the relatedness score for the least related article associated with each source article in our data. There is a mass point at 0.10 that corresponds to an additional cutoff
rule in PMRA. A smattering of source publications have some related articles with relatedness score below 0.10, but the overwhelming majority of those are incomplete
records: missing abstract, missing MeSH terms, or both. These account for less than 0.5% of the source articles. Finally, Panel C compares the relatedness of the least
related article for each source, by treatment status, and solely for the related articles that appeared after the death (respectively counterfactual death) of a star.

Note: We regress the log of pre-death subfield size (Panel A) and the log odds of the relatedness score for the least related article (Panel B) onto (i) journal fixed
effects; (ii) a suite of indicator variables for the source article’s number of authors; (iii) source article year of publication effects; and (iv) interaction terms
between each year of publication and a treatment status indicator. The graphs report the coefficient estimates, along with their associated 95% confidence
interval (corresponding to robust standard errors, clustered at the level of the star) for these 36 interaction terms.

Figure C4: From Source to Related Articles

Note: We illustrate the process of identifying the related articles through the use of an example. Ira Herskowitz, a superstar scientist in our sample, died in 2003. In
the five years prior to his death (1998-2002), Herskowitz was the last author on 12 publications. One of these publications is “The transcriptional program of
sporulation in budding yeast,” an article published in the journal Science in 1998. On the right-hand side panel, one sees that PMRA identifies 72 related
articles related to this source publication. Each of these related articles can then be parsed in a variety of ways. In particular, their authorship list can be
matched to the AAMC Faculty Roster, which allows us to distinguish between collaborators of Herskowitz’s and non-collaborators, as well as between the
subfield’s insiders vs. outsiders. Eight out of the 72 articles have a former or current collaborator on the authorship roster. Twenty two of the 72 articles in
the subfield cite the source article, while the source articles references eight of the articles in the subfield.

Article Overlap Between Subfield Pairs

Note: We compute the share of related articles that are shared between pairs of PMRA-delineated subfields.
To be conservative, we focus the analysis on 21,661 subfield pairs where a deceased superstar was the
last author on both of the associated source articles.

Distribution of Activity in Subfields Over Time

Note: This figure illustrates the timing of articles entering the subfields for a random sample of 5,000 articles
in PubMed (original articles, in journals indexed by Web of Science, that appeared between 1965 and
2003—the same range of years as for the source articles in our analytic sample), and we run them
through PMRA, rolling up the count of articles up to the subfield-year level (as in our regressions).

Note: The articles that are candidate for membership in each subfield
satisfy the following conditions: PMRA1 or PMRA2. We then
compute relatedness in this expanded neighborhood using the
tunable version of PMRA. We discard every article with new
relatedness score less than 0.20 (the median in the sample). As
a result, there is a cardinal cutoff, but no ordinal cutoff that
delineates subfield boundaries. 35 (0.1%) of the fields are outliers
with more than 5,000 articles. In the histogram above, we make
use of abstract & title words, in addition to MeSH terms, to
assess relatedness through PMRA.

publication flows in subfields are regressed onto year effects, subfield age effects, as well as 20 interaction terms between treatment status and the number of
years before/after the death event (the indicator variable for treatment status interacted with the year of death is omitted). The specifications also include
a full set of lead and lag terms common to both the treated and control subfields to fully account for transitory trends in subfield activity around the time
of the death. The 95% confidence interval (corresponding to robust standard errors, clustered around star scientist) around these estimates is plotted with
vertical light blue lines; Panel A corresponds to a dynamic version of the specification in the third column of Table C1; Panel B corresponds to a dynamic

Appendix D: Construction of the Control Group
We detail the procedure implemented to identify the control subfields that help pin down the life-cycle and
secular time effects in our difference-in-differences (DD) specification. Happenstance might yield a sample of
stars clustered in decaying scientific fields. More plausibly, activity in the typical subfield might be subject
to idiosyncratic life-cycle patterns, with their productive potential first increasing over time, eventually
peaking, and thereafter slowly declining. Relying solely on subfields treated earlier or later as an implicit
control group raises the worry that these time-varying omitted variables will not be fully captured by subfield
age controls, particularly since dating the birth of a subfield is a process fraught with hazards.
To address this concern, we create an additional level of difference by selecting control subfields. Recall that
selecting a subfield in our framework is akin to first selecting a source article and then using PMRA to harvest
all the related articles to this source in intellectual space. Since the second step is fully automated, only
the first step is really of concern. Practically, we will recruit control source articles from the set of articles
authored by star scientists who do not die prematurely. But what makes a satisfactory control group? It is
important to distinguish between ex ante vs. ex post criteria. Ex ante, one would like control source articles
to have the following properties:
1. to be published contemporaneously with the source article for the treated subfield;
2. to be unrelated (in both an intellectual and a social sense) to the source article for the treated subfield;
3. to be of similar expected impact and fruitfulness, relative to the source article for the treated subfield;
4. to have a similar number of authors as the source article for the treated subfield;
5. to have a superstar author in the same authorship position and of approximately the same age as
that occupied by the deceased superstar on the authorship roster of the source article for the treated
subfield.
Ex post, it will be important for the control subfields to satisfy an additional condition: the treated and
control subfields should exhibit very similar trends in publication activity and funding flows up to the year
of treatment (i.e., the year of death for the treated superstar).
Coarsened Exact Matching. To meet these goals, we implement a “Coarsened Exact Matching” (CEM)
procedure (Blackwell et al. 2009). The first step is to select a relatively small set of covariates on which
we need to guarantee balance ex ante. This choice entails judgement, but is strongly guided by the set of
criteria listed above. The second step is to create a large number of strata to cover the entire support of the
joint distribution of the covariates selected in the previous step. In a third step, each observation is allocated
to a unique strata, and for each observation in the treated group, control observations are selected from the
same strata.
The procedure is coarse because we do not attempt to precisely match on covariate values; rather, we coarsen
the support of the joint distribution of the covariates into a finite number of strata, and we match a treated
observation if and only if a control observation can be recruited from this strata. An important advantage
of CEM is that the analyst can guarantee the degree of covariate balance ex ante, but this comes at a cost:
the more fine-grained the partition of the support for the joint distribution (i.e., the higher the number of
strata), the larger the number of unmatched treated observations.
Implementation. We identify controls based on the following set of covariates (t denotes the year of
death): star scientist career age; citations received by the article up to year t; number of authors; position
of the star author on the authorship roster (only last authorship position is considered); journal; and year

xxv

of publication. The first three covariates only need to match within relatively coarse bins. For instance, we
create nine career age categories: less than 10 years; between 10 and 20 years; between 20 and 25 years;
between 25 and 30 years; between 30 and 35 years; between 35 and 40 years; between 40 and 45 years;
between 45 and 50 years, over 50 years of career age. Similarly, we coarsen the distribution of citations at
baseline into five mutually exclusive bins: zero citations; between one and 10 citations; between 10 and 50
citations; between 50 and 120 citations; and more than 120 citations. In contrast, we impose an exact match
on journal, publication year, and the star’s authorship position.
We match approximately 75% of the treated source articles in this way. Some further trimming of the control
articles is needed. First, we eliminate any control that shares any author with the treated source. Second,
we eliminate any control article with a dead star scientist on its authorship roster, even if he appears in an
intermediate position in the authorship list. Third, we drop every control that also happens to be related
intellectually to its source as per PMRA. Finally, we drop from the data any source article that finds itself an
orphan (i.e., not paired with any control) at the conclusion of this process. Figure D1 provides an illustrative
example.
The final sample has 3,074 treated source articles and 31,142 control source articles. As can be seen in
Figure D2, the distribution of activity levels, measured by cumulative publications up to the baseline year,
is very similar between treated and control subfields. As well, there is no evidence of preexisting trends
in activity, as demonstrated by the coefficient estimates graphed in Figure 1 and E1. In Table 2, treated
and control subfields are very well-balanced on the covariates that formed the basis of the CEM matching
procedure. This is true almost by construction. What is more surprising (and also welcome) is that the
procedure balances a number of covariates that were not used as inputs for matching, such as various metrics
of star eminence. For other covariates, we can detect statistically significant mean differences, though they
do not appear to be substantively meaningful (e.g., 6.7% of control stars vs. 9.9% of treated stars are female).
Sensitivity Analyses. Human judgement matters for the outcome of the CEM procedure insofar as one
must draw a list of “reasonable” covariates to match on, as well as decide on the degree of coarsening to
impose. We have verified that slight variations in the implementation (e.g., varying slightly the number of
cutoff points for the stock of baseline citations for the source; focusing on birth age as opposed to career age
for the stars) have little impact on the main results.

Figure D1: Matching Procedure to Identify Controls for the Source Articles

Note: The two articles above illustrate the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) procedure. These two articles appeared in the journal Science in 1998. They received a
similar number of citations up to the end of the baseline year (2002, one year before Herskowitz’s death): 514 citations for Chu et al., 344 citations for Neumann
et al. Note that Alan Perelson and Ira Herskowitz are both in last authorship position. They also obtained their PhD within a year of each other.

Appendix E: Extensions
Extended descriptive statistics. For space reasons, Table 2 provided descriptive statistics at baseline
for only a selected set of right-hand side covariates and outcome variables. In Tables E1 and E2, we present
descriptive statistics and correlation matrices for all the covariates and outcome variables that appear either
in the main body of the manuscript, or in Appendixes E and F. Table E1a highlights balance between
control and treated subfields at baseline for a simple transformation of the outcome variables. Recall that
our outcome variables are of the form “number of articles in subfield i and year t that satisfy some condition,”
where examples of such conditions include, inter alia, “by non-collaborators only, where these related authors
had no prior participation in the subfield” or “by non-collaborators only, where the focal star is not cited in
the list of references.” We transform these flow variables into cumulative stock variables, taking into account
the years between the birth of the subfield and the year of death (or counterfactual death). So, for example,
at baseline, the stock or related articles by non-collaborators that list references only outside the subfield
are balanced between control and treated subfields (13.764 vs. 13.789).xii
Table E1b provides descriptive statistics for star-level (e.g., cumulative NIH funding at baseline) and subfieldlevel (e.g., commitment of the star to the subfield) covariates. These covariates are used to realize sample
splits around their medians in Tables 6 and 7 of the manuscript, and in Tables E5, E7, and E8 of Appendix E.
In Table E2, we also display correlation matrices for these variables. To make the matrix legible, we
place correlations for subfield-level covariates and star-level covariates in separate tables (E2a and E2b).
The correlations are typically reassuringly high across measures within a construct (e.g., , but low across
constructs.
Event study graphs using the raw data. Figure E1 provides graphical evidence of the effect of star
death on subfield entry using raw data. This involves an important simplification—anchoring the comparison
between control and treated subfields on “experimental time” (the number of years elapsed since treatment),
ignoring the fact that our death events are staggered over a long time period (1975 to 2003). Yet, these
graphs provide visual evidence that the main effects of death on subfield growth or decline we document in
regression specifications saturated with calendar year and age effects (Figure 2) are also apparent in the raw
data. The graphs in Figure E1 also make vivid the life-cycle of subfields. Given a particular source article,
PMRA creates a list of intellectual neighbors that, when added together at the year level, generate subfields
whose evolution over time follows an inverted U-shape, with the peak of the U corresponding to the year of
publication for the source.xiii Of course, these life cycle patterns are a reflection of design choices for PMRA.
That being said, a plausible feature of the scientific process is that papers related to a focal one will be more
likely to appear in close temporal proximity with it.
Sudden vs. Anticipated Death Events. To gain statistical power, our main results pool the subfields
of stars who died suddenly with those of stars whose untimely passing was anticipated. Yet, the case for
the exogeneity of a death event is stronger when it is sudden; when the death can be anticipated, it is
theoretically possible for the star to engage in “intellectual estate planning,” whereby particular scientists
(presumably close collaborators) are anointed as exemplars of the next generation of leaders in the subfield.
Table E3 breaks down our core set of results by cause of death, focusing on entry by non-collaborators only.
Contrasting the coefficient estimates across Panel A and Panel B in the first column of Table E1, relative
subfield growth appears to be driven by stars whose death was anticipated. The effect in the case of sudden
death is small in magnitude and imprecisely estimated.
xii

Note that the variables in Table E1a pertain to subfield entry by non-collaborators only, except the first three, which
correspond to the outcome variables in the right-most three columns of Table 3 (number of NIH grants acknowledged by articles
in the subfield, in total, by collaborators only, and by non-collaborators only).
xiii
On Figures E1, Panels A, B, and C, the peak appears roughly two to three years before the death, and not in
the year of death. But recall that the source articles that generate the subfields in our data appeared in the window
[tyr death−5 ; tyr death−1 ]. As such, the peak observed in these figures is an average of the peaks for subfields associated
with sources published in the years tyr death−5 , tyr death−4 , . . . , tyr death−1 .

xxviii

As in Table 4, we parse every related article in the subfield to assign them into one of six mutually exclusive
bins, based on their vintage-specific long-run citation impact: articles that fall in the bottom quartile of the
citation distribution; in the second quartile; in the third quartile; articles that fall above the 75th percentile,
but below the 95th percentile; articles that fall above the 95th percentile, but below the 99th percentile; and
articles that fall above the 99th percentile of the citation distribution. Decomposing this effect across the
quantile bins as above reveals that the differences between the cases of sudden and anticipated death can be
accounted for by shifts in activity for low-impact contributions. In the right tail of the distribution, there is
very little evidence that the manner of superstar death matters at all for the fate of their subfields. In both
cases, non-collaborators increase their relative contribution sharply—on the order of 40%.
Figure E2 and E3 display event study-style graphs in the spirit of Figure 2, Panel C. When using all
publications (regardless of impact) as the metric of activity in a subfield (Figure E2), we can see that
the upward trend is more pronounced (as well as statistically significant) in the case of anticipated events.
When using only “top publications” (specifically, those in the upper 5 percentiles of the citation distribution,
adjusted for each year of publication), the differences are less stark. Consistent with a dearth of statistical
power, our ability to estimate these effects precisely is also limited. This convergence of the effect of death
when focused on the upper tail of the impact distribution legitimates our choice to pool the data for sudden
and anticipated events.
Consolidating vs. disruptive entry. The findings above do not imply that the published results of
entrants necessarily contradict or overturn the prevailing scientific understanding and assumptions within a
subfield. Direct evidence of these contributions’ disruptive impact is elusive. To provide indirect evidence,
we use the “disruptiveness” index (hereafter denoted d) recently proposed by Funk and Owen-Smith (2017),
which seeks to capture whether an idea consolidates or destabilizes the status quo. d measures the extent to
which the future ideas that build on the focal idea also rely on its acknowledged predecessors. In practice,
for article i, it is defined as:
n
1 X
[1(j ∨ Ki ) − 1(j ∧ Ki )]
di =
ni j=1
where j indexes the forward citing articles (j = 1, . . . , n), Ki is the set of articles {k1 , k2 , . . . , kp } that are
(backwards) referenced within i, ni is the number of forward citations to article i, 1(j ∨ Ki ) is equal to
one if forward citing article j does not reference any of the articles in Ki , and 1(j ∧ Ki ) is equal to one
if forward citing article j does reference at least one of the articles in Ki . d = 1 for articles that are
“maximally destabilizing,” in the sense that there is no overlap between the articles referenced by the focal
article and the references listed in the papers that cite it. In contrast, d = −1 for articles that are “maximally
consolidating,” in the sense that every citing article and the source have at least one reference in common.
We compute the d index for all related articles in our data (mean= −.39, median= −.49, s.d.= .47). We count
the number of related articles that belong to a particular quantile bin of d. We create six non-overlapping
bins: below the 10th percentile of d, between the 10th and the 25th percentile, between the 25th and the 50th
percentile, between the 50th and the 75th percentile, between the 75th and the 95th percentile, and above the
95th percentile of d. In a final step, we roll up the outcome at the subfield-year level. We then run a separate
regression with each of these six outcome measures, using the research design outlined in Section 4.1. As
can be observed in Table E4, the relationship between star death and subfield entry by non-collaborators
is non-monotonic in the extent to which it entails disrupting the paradigms of the treated subfields. The
relationship is strongest for related articles that fall in the intermediate range of the “disruptiveness” metric.
In contrast, the effect is zero and noisy when focusing on entry by both the most disruptive and the most
consolidating articles.
Taken together, the results in Tables 5 and E4 paint a nuanced picture of directional change in the wake of
superstar death. The new contributions do not represent a departure from the subfield’s concerns. At the
same time, the citation evidence makes it clear that these additional contributions often draw from more
recent and different sources of knowledge for inspiration. Moreover, rather than to view these contributions

xxix

as the expression of a Kuhnian paradigm shift within the subfield, it seems more appropriate to interpret
them as reflecting the impact of a myriad “small r,” permanent revolutions whereby new ideas come to the
fore without necessarily eclipsing prior approaches.
Subfield characteristics. Table E5 examines how three different characteristics of subfields influence the
magnitude of the treatment effect. We first inquire whether post-death entry by non-collaborators is more
pronounced is subfields with forward momentum, relative to those where activity is relatively more subdued
in the years leading up to the star’s death. To create a metric of subfield “hotness,” we compute the fraction
of all papers in the subfield that were published in the window of five years before the star’s death (or
counterfactual death for the control subfields).xiv We then contrast the magnitude of the treatment effect
in the subsamples of “hot” and “cold” subfields, respectively, by splitting the data across the median of the
hotness covariate. Interestingly, the subfields with relatively less intense activity are driving the post-death
entry effect. The treatment effect for hot subfields is half as small in magnitude, relative to that for cold
subfields, and not statistically significant.
Next, we focus on the number of scientists trained by the star that had been active in the subfield before his
death. We conjecture that the subfields of stars who produced many intellectual “offsprings” may be less
welcoming to outsiders than those in which the stars did not train many graduate students or postdoctoral
fellows. Of course, we do not have evidence that these individuals, once trained, remained intellectually
beholden to the star. To identify trainees, we focus on the subset of collaborators who occupy the first
author position in articles where the star occupies the last position; with the added stipulation that the
coauthored publication appears in a window of ± three years around the year in which the collaborator’s
highest degree was received. We then count of the number of investigators trained by the star before his
(possibly counterfactual) death. The results in Table E5 indicate that subfields that are relatively more
endogamous (more than two trainees, the median of this covariate) experience elevated rates of entry after
the star’s death, relative to before. However, the difference between the coefficients corresponding to subfield
with an above median of number of trainees versus below median number of trainees is not itself statistically
significant.
Finally, we examine whether a star’s level of commitment to a subfield moderates the extent of the post-death
entry boost. Recall from Table 6 that the subfields where stars are relatively more important experience more
entry following the star’s death. A star could be important to a subfield, while not being fully committed to
it, in the sense that his presence in the subfield represents only a small part of his overall published output.
Empirically, we compute commitment as the fraction of a star’s publications that fall into the focal subfield,
and we split the data according to the median of this measure (which is equal to 0.14 in the data). The
magnitudes of the treatment effects are very similar. What appears to be associated with the post-death
entry boost is the star’s importance to the subfield while alive, and not the extent of his commitment to it.
Impact of research infrastructure needs. Our analysis is limited to the life sciences and biomedical
research. Though this area accounts for a large fraction of publicly funded, civilian research funding in
the United States, it is not necessarily representative of all fields of science. In particular, some domains
of research, like high-energy particle physics for example, require access to expensive and lumpy capital
equipment, such as the Large Hadron Collider that came on line in 2009 at the cost $8 billion dollars
(Stephan 2012). In contrast to the “big science,” hypercollaborative projects that are emerging as the norm
in these fields (e.g., Aad et al. 2015), academic life scientists require funding in sizable, but more modest
amounts to do frontier research. In scientific domains where capital needs are lumpy, the phenomenon of
entry in the wake of the passing of an eminent scientists may play out very differently, depending on the
institutions that govern access to the scarce capital equipment.
xiv
Only the articles in the subfield that were published before the death are taking into account when computing this ratio.
The mean hotness across subfields is 0.61 (very similar to the median), with a standard deviation equal to 0.21.

Within biomedical research, large-scale clinical trials most closely resemble the characteristics of those other
capital-intensive science fields. These necessitate a large infrastructure of data collection, monitoring, and
management, which is why these activities are often consolidated in large cooperative groups such as the
AIDS Clinical Trials Group, the Children’s Oncology Group, or the Framingham Heart Study. PubMed has
a “publication type” field which allows us to identify the subfields that are clinical-trial intensive (10% of
the subfields) versus those that are not (the remaining 90%).
Table E6 replicates the results of Table 3 separately for these two subsamples. Unsurprisingly, our ability
to estimate statistically significant effects is limited to the much larger set of non clinical trial-intensive
subfields. That said, the magnitudes for the clinical trial-intensive subfields are very similar.
Star characteristics. We saw in Table 6 that the passing of stars that shone brighter while they were
alive (measured by citations, publications or funding at death) appear to be driving much of the effect on
non-collaborator entry. Tables E7 and E8 focus on other star characteristics that might moderate the core
finding. The first two columns of Table E7 show that the subfields of relatively younger stars (those aged 60
and below at the time of their deaths, the median in our sample) account for much of the overall impact of
death—the magnitude of the effect for older stars is very small and imprecisely estimated. However, there is
potentially a distinction between being “young in the field” and simply being young. We measure experience
in a subfield by capturing the year in which the star first published within it. Subfield experience varies
from 1 to 38 years, with a median of seven and a mean of 8.36. The last two columns of Table E7 imply that
the stars who are above median in subfield experience are associated with slightly more post-death entry,
but the difference is very slight.
Table E8 brings more nuance to the analysis by focusing on the extent to which the star was leading vs.
lagging the frontier of his subfields at the time of death. We develop two alternative measures of “distance
to the frontier.” We assume that frontier work will be more likely to reference more recent science, and
alternatively will tend to be tagged by MeSH keyword combinations that are of more recent vintage. In
a window of five years before the death, we then contrast the difference in reference vintage (respectively
MeSH term combination vintage) for articles written by the star vs. articles written by all other authors. We
then split subfields according to the median of this difference. Across all measures, the results in Table E8
tend to show that the effect of post-death entry are larger for those subfields where the star was leading
when he passed, relative to those where his lead may have been slight or his research even staler than that
of other researchers in the subfield.
Outsiders vs. competitors: A reprise. Recall that Figure 3 focused on the extent to which related
authors were outsiders vs. previous incumbents in the subfields that expand in the wake of a star’s death.
For every related article, we matched their authorship roster to the Faculty Roster of the AAMC. Using the
matched authors’ past publication record, we can then ascertain the fraction of each related author’s output
that fall in the focal subfield. We then sorted each related article into 11 mutually exclusive bins: zero overlap
(which corresponds to the bottom two quartiles of the overlap distribution), and a separate bin for every five
percentiles above the median (50th to 55th percentile, 55th to 60th percentile,. . . , 95th to 99th percentile), as
well as a top percentile bin. We then computed the corresponding measures of subfield activity by aggregating
the data up to the subfield/year level. We presented the results graphically in Figure 3, Panel B, where each
dot corresponds to the magnitude of the treatment effect in a separate regression with the outcome variable
being the number of articles in each subfield that belong to the corresponding bins.
In Table E9, we provide, in regression table form this time, a variant of Table 3 where overlap is measured
not just with respect to the focal subfield, but rather with respect to the combined subfields of a given star.
We also simplify the number of bins, with only five: related articles by new scientists, related articles by
scientists with zero overlap who have published in the past in other subfields, related articles by scientists in
the third quartile of overlap, related articles by scientists whose past publication record puts them between
the 75th and 95th percentile of the overlap distribution, and finally related articles by scientists whose past
publication record puts them above the 95th percentile of the overlap distribution. With this “global”

xxxi

measure of overlap, one can observe that the post-death entry boost is driven by scientists with no, or only
limited past participation in the subfields where the star was active.
The lifecycle of stardom. The results in our manuscript naturally raise implications for welfare. We
expound the view that once securely ensconced at the helm of their field, stars leverage their power for
longer than a benevolent social planner might prefer. This argument would be less tenable if stars were
able to remain at the peak of their intellectual abilities until the very twilight of their careers. To shed
light on the career life cycle for superstars, we focus on the 5,878 control stars in our analytic sample, and
construct a panel dataset of publications at the star scientist-year level.xv Using Poisson specifications, we
then regress publication output onto year effects, indicator variables for degree (MD, PhD, MD/PhD), an
indicator variable for female scientists, indicator variable for departmental affiliation (medicine vs. surgery
vs. cell biology, etc.), indicator variables for the year in which the highest degree was received as well as
52 indicator variables for age effects (from age 29 to age 80, with ages below 29 absorbed in the omitted
category).
Panel A of Figure E4 displays the estimates corresponding to the age effects when then outcome in the
specification is the overall number of publications in a given year. Panel B restricts the outcome measure to
publications whose number of long-run citations lies above the 95th percentile of the vintage-specific citation
distribution at the article level. Panel C proceeds in the same spirit, but focuses on even more impactful
publications, those whose number of long-run citations lie above the 99th percentile of the vintage-specific
citation distribution at the article level. As can be observed in all three panels, the productive life cycle
of stars follows an inverted U-shaped pattern, with a peak occurring earlier for highly cited publications,
followed by a steeper drop off.

We eliminate the 452 extinct stars from the sample since their life cycle was interrupted prematurely.

Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. Like in Table 4 in the manuscript,
the dependent variable is the total number of publications by non-collaborators in a subfield in a particular
year, where these publications fall in a particular quantile bin of the long-run, vintage-adjusted citation
distribution for the universe of journal articles in PubMed. In Panel A, the sample is limited to 1,576 subfields
associated with 229 stars whose death is anticipated (along with the corresponding control subfields); and in
Panel B, the sample is limited to 1,342 subfields associated with 185 stars whose death is sudden and unexpected
(along with the corresponding control subfields). All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield
age effects, as well as a term common to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after
the death of the star. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as
elasticities. For example, the estimates in the first column of Panel A, imply that treated subfields see an
increase in the number of contributions by non-collaborators after the superstar passes away—a statistically
significant 100×(exp[0.128]-1)=13.66%.

the total number of publications by non-collaborators within a subfield in a particular year. Each pair of
columns splits the sample across the median of a particular covariate for the sample of subfields (treated
and control) in the baseline year. The first set of two columns examines differences in the extent to which
the “hotness” of the subfield—defined as the fraction of the subfield’s activity that falls within the time
window of five years before the star’s death—influences the rate at which non-collaborators enter the field

Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the
total number of publications by non-collaborators within a subfield in a particular year. We develop two
alternative measures of “distance to the frontier.” We assume that frontier work will be more likely to
reference more recent science, and alternatively will tend to be tagged by MeSH keyword combinations that
are of more recent vintage. In a window of five years before the death, we then contrast the difference in
reference vintage (respectively MeSH term combination vintage) for articles written by the star vs. articles
written by all other authors. We then split subfields according to the median of this difference. All models
incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term common to both treated
and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star, to address the concern that
age, year and individual fixed effects may not fully account for trends in subfield entry around the time of
death for the deceased star. Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the level of the star scientist.

This table displays a variation of the results depicted in Figure 3, Panel B in regression form. Estimates stem
from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total number of
publications by non-collaborators within a subfield in a particular year, broken into five bins: publications by
new scientists; publications that fall below the median of our measure of field overlap between the star and the
related investigators identified on these articles’ authorship roster; publications that fall in the third quartile of
the field overlap measure; publications that fall in the fourth quartile but below the top ventile of the field
overlap measure; and finally publications that fall in the top ventile of the measure. In contrast to Figure 3, in
this case overlap has been defined with respect to the “global” subfield that encompasses all the subfields of a
given star in the data, as opposed to the “local” measure where overlap with the focal subfield determines the
extent of overlap. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term
common to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star, to
address the concern that age, year and individual fixed effects may not fully account for trends in subfield entry
around the time of death for the deceased star. Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the level of
the star scientist. †p < 0.10, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Note: For the sample of 5,878 control superstars, we create a panel dataset at the scientist-year level. We regress (i) publication output in a given year (Panel A) and (ii)
highly-cited publications in a given year (Panels B and C) onto year effects, indicator variables for degree (MD, PhD, MD/PhD), an indicator variable for female scientists,
indicator variable for departmental affiliation (medicine vs. surgery vs. cell biology, etc.), indicator variables for the year in which the highest degree was received as well
as 52 indicator variables for age effects (from age 29 to age 80, with ages below 29 absorbed in the omitted category). In Panel B, a publication is deemed to be highly
cited if it falls above the 95th percentile of the vintage-specific citation distribution at the article level. In Panel C, a publication is deemed to be highly cited if it falls
above the 99th percentile of the vintage-specific citation distribution at the article level. The above plots display the estimates for the age indicator variables up to the
age of 70 (to preserve the same scale across the three figures), together with their associated 95% confidence interval. The list of covariates is strictly identical across the
three panels.

Appendix F: Robustness Checks
Balanced panel. With treatment events staggered over time, a concern with the dynamic specifications
summarized in Figure 2 is that the magnitude of the treatment effect might not be stable over time. Because
our observation period stops in 2006, the lead terms far away from death are identified by only a subsample
of the data (see Figure F1). Could such heterogeneity confound the true dynamics, for example if deaths
that occurred earlier in the sample have a bigger effect? To address this concern, we extend the observation
period used to generate the event study graphs in Figure 2 from 2006 to 2012, resulting in a sample that is
almost perfectly balanced in a window of ten years before to ten years after the death of a superstar. As
can be seen in Figure F2, which replicates Figure 2 in all respects except the length of the analytic sample,
the results change very little.
This figure begs another question: why not simply use this longer observation period as the default throughout the paper? There are two reasons. First, we cannot identify collaborator status reliably after 2006
because this is the last year of the data in our version of the AAMC Faculty Roster. Second, whereas we
can account precisely for the employment status of the control superstars up to 2006 (the year during which
we coded their CVs), some may retire, or even die in the years that follow, raising the specter that their
subfields are not adequate controls during the 2007-2012 time period. As a result, we quickly revert back to
the observation window 1965-2006 in all that follows.
Main results, rolled up to the scientist-level of analysis. The treatment variable exhibits variation
at the level of the star scientist, and not at the level of the subfield-star pair. Of course, we cluster the
standard errors at the star level, and we exploit the differential position of a star across his subfields to shed
light on mechanisms. But do our main results survive when the data is “rolled up” to the star-year level of
the analysis? To probe the robustness of our benchmark set of results, we lump all related articles for each
star together as if they belonged to a single subfield. Nevertheless, the results in Table F1 and Figure F3 are
very similar to those in Table 3 and Figure 2, both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. One
exception is the coefficient on the effect of entry by collaborators in Table F1, which is negative as expected,
but smaller in magnitude, relative to the corresponding coefficient in Table 3.
Alternate functional forms. Despite its robustness and appropriateness for the analysis of skewed positive
outcomes, the conditional fixed effects Poisson model of Hausman et al. (1984) has an important shortcoming:
subfields for which there is no variation in the outcome during the observation period (for example, because
the outcome is uniformly zero) drop out of the sample. This is why the number of observations in many
tables varies slightly from column to column. Fixed-effects OLS models do not suffer from this limitation.
In Table F2 and Figure F4, we examine the sensitivity of our benchmark set of results to the choice of
alternative functional forms. In the three columns to the left, we simply use the “raw” number of articles
in the subfield as the outcome, and perform estimation by OLS. Of course, the estimates are not directly
interpretable in terms of elasticities. At the mean of the data, however, the treatment effect in the third
column implies that subfield entry by non-collaborating authors expands by 0.409/3.335 = 12.26%, which is
not all that different from the 8.2% reported in Table 3.
In the three columns to the right, Table F2 reports results corresponding to OLS estimation, but this time
with the outcome variables transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function (Burbidge et al. 1988).xvi
In this case, coefficient estimates can be interpreted as elasticities, as an approximation. They are quite
similar once again to those reported in Table 3, except for the effect on entry by collaborators, which is
smaller in magnitude.
√
sinh−1 (x) = ln(x + x2 + 1). Unlike the log of x, the inverse hyperbolic sine is defined at zero, which is attractive here
because a substantial proportion of the subfields in the data display no activity in a particular year. For example, all subfields
obviously see entry over the entire observation period, and yet in 31.33% of the subfield-year observations, the number of articles
entering is zero.
xvi

xliv

Figure F4 presents dynamic analogs of the results in the the third column (Panel A) and sixth column
(Panel B) of Table F2. In the case of the raw outcomes (Panel A), one can detect a trend in outcome before
the event, though it is not estimated precisely. The results using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation
(Panel B) exhibit no evidence of a pre-trend.
Size of the control group. The first three columns in Table F3 drop from the sample all the control
subfields, but are otherwise analogous to the core results presented in Table 3, Panel A. In these specifications,
subfields who were treated in the past or will be treated in the future serve as implicit controls for the
subfields currently experiencing the death of their associated star. The results are qualitatively similar to
those displayed in Table 3. However, the corresponding event study graphs (Figure F5) clearly show that
dropping the control group from the estimation sample produces pre-event trends that cast doubt on a
research design based on a single level of difference. This provides a clear rationale for our preferred research
design, which adds an additional level of difference to the data—that provided by control subfields.
The second set of three columns in Table F3 attempt to replicate the results of Table 3 in a sample such that
for each treated subfield, there is exactly one control subfield (selected at random from the set of control
subfields for each treated source). The magnitudes are qualitatively similar to those observed in Table 3, but
the standard errors are larger. We conclude that the approximate 1 : 10 ratio of treated to control subfields
is important insofar as it provides the statistical power to estimate the post-death term that is common
between treated and control subfields, and to do so net of the subfield age and calendar year dynamics.
Are death events exogenous? Could some of the deaths in our sample be caused by stress as others are
seeking to break a stars’ hold on a field? Chronic stress can lead to a wide range of adverse health conditions.
Most of these conditions diminish quality of life but not mortality per se. The most notable link between
stress and death is through heart disease. Thus one possibility is that stress increases the risk of a heart
attack. 14% of the extinct superstars (who account for 16.75% of the treated subfields) die of a heart attack.
In Table F4 (three leftmost columns), we replicate the results of Table 3 while excluding these subfields. The
point estimates are slightly larger in magnitude, and also slightly more precisely estimated when excluding
the subfields associated with heart attack events. Of course, there may be other more indirect channels
through which stress can precipitate death. From a study design perspective, we would be more concerned
with this threat to identification if subfield growth was trending upward before the death. But from the
event study-type figures we present (Figure 2, as well as numerous variations in Appendices E and F), this
does not appear to be the case.
Multi-disciplinary source articles and the validity of the control group. Multi-disciplinary journals
such as PNAS, Science, or Nature account for 10% of the subfields in our data.xvii This could be problematic
insofar as these prestigious outlets publish articles in all scientific fields, and we recruit control source articles
from the same journal and year as that of the treated source article. Take the source paper by Chu et al.
(1998)—already used as an example in Appendix D—which appeared in the issue of Science dated October
23rd of that year. The same issue includes a paper with the title “Climate and groundwater recharge during
the last glaciation in an ice-covered region” and another called “Self-organized growth of three- dimensional
quantum-Dot crystals with fcc-like stacking and a tunable lattice constant.” It would not seem advisable to
use one of these as the source for a control subfield, since they do not pertain to the life sciences, even under
the most expansive definition of this term.
This is not an issue in practice, since to qualify as a control, it is not sufficient for a candidate source article
to appear in the same journal and year as its treated counterpart. In addition, we impose the requirement
that one of our 12,000+ still alive superstars is in last authorship position. This will filter out of the set
of potential controls any non-biomedical articles that appear in these outlets since all the stars in our data
xvii

Note that PLoS One, a very large multidisciplinary journal, does not contribute any source article in our sample. This is
because it was founded in 2006, and the latest year of publication for one of the source articles (treated or control) is 2002 (one
year before the latest year of death, which is 2003).

xlv

(deceased or not) are life scientists. We have also replicated the benchmark results excluding the subfields
that are associated with a source article published in either Science, Nature, or PNAS. The results are
displayed in the three rightmost columns in Table F4. The point estimates are very similar to those we
obtain in our benchmark set of analyses (columns 1, 2, and 3 of Table 3).
Source articles, with and without abstracts. In Table F5, we perform one analysis that (imperfectly)
tries to assess the sensitivity of our results to the use of author-chosen information to delineate the set of
intellectual neighbors in a subfield. Ten percent of the subfields in the data radiate from source articles
for which PubMed does not have an abstract. For these subfields, PMRA must therefore make do without
abstract words (i.e., relying solely on title words and MeSH terms) to return a set of neighbors. We reproduce
our benchmark set of specifications (the first panel of Table 3) on the set of subfields radiating from source
articles with and without abstract information. As can be seen above, the estimates for the sample restricted
to abstractless source articles are less precisely estimated than for the sample restricted to the much larger
number of subfields associated with source articles that have an abstract. The magnitudes in both cases,
however, are quite similar, which we find reassuring.
Table 7 estimated on the subsample of less-well cited stars. Table 7 provides evidence that subfield
entry is more pronounced after the death of an eminent scientist when the subfield can be perceived as less
coherent, or when the colleagues of the star are less able to exert control over critical resources after he has
passed away. However, the sample for these results was limited to the subfields of well-cited stars (those
above the median by cumulative citations in the sample, in the year of death). For completeness, Table F6
provides an exact analog to Table 7, except that in this case the sample is limited to the subfields of less
well-cited stars (those below the median by cumulative citations in the sample, in the year of death).
The results in this subsample are less consistent across measures than was the case for the more eminent
stars. Many pairs of columns do not show notable differences between more coherent and less coherent
subfields, or between more indirectly controlled vs. less indirectly controlled subfields. In two instances,
however, the direction of the results is opposite to that observed in Table 7. First, subfields that were
relatively less consolidated according to the metric of Funk and Owen-Smith (2017) see increased entry after
the passing of a less eminent star (second and third columns of Panel A). Second, subfields in which the
less eminent star had important coauthors sitting on NIH study sections in the last five years of his life also
experience elevated rated of entry post-death (second and third columns of Panel B).

Estimates stem from conditional (star) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total
number of publications in the collection of subfields in which the star (deceased or not) was active in a particular
year. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and star career age effects, as well as term common to
both treated and control stars that switches from zero to one after the (possibly counterfactual) death of the
star. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. For
example, the estimates in column (3) imply that treated stars see an increase in the number of contributions by
non-collaborators in their fields—a statistically significant 100×(exp[0.249]-1)=28.27%. Robust standard errors

Note: Estimates stem from conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is the total number of publications by noncollaborators in a subfield in a particular year. The sample is limited to the subfields in which the least eminent among the stars were active
(specifically, below the median of the “cumulative citations up to the year of death” metric). Each pair of columns splits the sample across the median
of a particular covariate for the sample of fields (treated and control) in the baseline year. For example, the first two columns of Panel B compare the
magnitude of the treatment effect for stars whose collaborators have written an above-median number of editorials in the five years preceding the
superstar’s death, vs. a below-median number of editorials. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and subfield age effects, as well as a term
common to both treated and control subfields that switches from zero to one after the death of the star. Exponentiating the coefficients and differencing
from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the level of the star scientist. †p < 0.10, *p <

Note: The graphs in this figure are patterned after Figure 2 in the main body of the manuscript. The dark blue dots correspond to coefficient estimates stemming from
conditional (subfield) fixed effects Poisson specifications in which publication flows in subfields are regressed onto year effects, subfield age effects, as well as 20
interaction terms between treatment status and the number of years before/after the death event (the indicator variable for treatment status interacted with the year
of death is omitted). The specifications also include a full set of lead and lag terms common to both the treated and control subfields to fully account for transitory
trends in subfield activity around the time of the death. The sample used to estimate these specifications differs in one respect from our main sample: it has been
extended from 2006 to 2012, which entails that at least nine years of data are available to identify the treatment effects far away from death (the latest date of death
in our sample is 2003). The 95% confidence interval (corresponding to robust standard errors, clustered around star scientist) around these estimates is plotted with
the vertical light blue lines.

Appendix G: Displacement Effects
Conceptual challenges. We find that activity by non-collaborators of the star increases in the fields in
which the superstar was active prior to his death. In principle, it is possible that commensurate declines
can be observed in the fields where these related authors were active but the star was not. However, these
displacement effects might be very diffuse—spread out over many subfields, and thus difficult to detect in
our subfield-level of analysis. To examine this possibility more directly, we shift the level of analysis away
from the subfield to that of the related author.
It is important to note however, that the panel dataset at the related author level is not simply the mirror
image of the subfield panel dataset using an alternative way to aggregate the data. In particular, an author
can only be represented in the sample if he was active in one of the star’s subfields prior to his untimely
death. But we have seen in Figure 3 and Table E10 that the bulk of the effect of death can be traced to
new entrants in the subfield. We do not include these authors in the author-level analysis, because doing
so would imply that the individuals are part of the sample because of an event that is itself a result of the
treatment.
As a consequence, there should be no presumption that the magnitudes of the effect of star death at the
author level and at the subfield level match. Since the author-level analysis necessarily excludes entrants, a
reasonable conjecture is that the author-level effects will be smaller.
Author-level sample. In building up a sample of related authors, we face an important practical hurdle.
A related author is frequently related to more than a single eminent scientist. Around which star should we
anchor the analysis? In order to pin down a single year of treatment for each related author, we use two
different metrics. The first is simply the number of related articles before the star’s death—we associate to
a related author the star with the highest count. The second metric is based on the cardinal relatedness
score—we select the star that has the most highly related article among all the stars to whom the author is
intellectually related. We proceed in a rigorously symmetric fashion for the related authors of control stars.
Since we are now choosing a focal star on which to anchor our analysis, but we know that authors are
related to several distinct stars, we no longer maintain the distinction between those publications that are
related and unrelated to a particular star. Rather, we turn our attention to the effect of superstar death
on the total output of related authors (in terms of publications and NIH grants awarded). Recall that
non-collaborators are contributing more within the subfields of the dead superstars with whom they are
intellectually related (Table 3). Therefore, the absence of changes in total output would imply that this
additional work is displacing work they were doing in other subfields, at least in part.
Results. We are now ready to proceed with a related author-level analysis whose structure parallels that
of our main specifications at the subfield level. We investigate the effect of star death on related authors’
(i) NIH grants awarded; (ii) publication output; and (iii) publication output split between “PI articles” and
“non-PI articles.”xviii
The results are displayed in Table G1. When looking at either publication or grant output, we do not find
evidence of sustained increases after the death of a superstar. When focusing on authors associated with
stars because of the number of related articles between the two, the effect of death tends to be small in
magnitude and statistically indistinguishable from zero (the four leftmost columns of Table G1). These
results change slightly when we focus on authors whose research was, at least in part, very closely related to
xviii

PI articles—those where the focal author appears in first or last position on the authorship roster—are most intimately
identified with his laboratory (Zuckerman 1968; Nagaoka and Owan 2014). In contrast, the articles where the related author
appears in the middle of the authorship list correspond to research projects for which the author’s substantive contribution
might have been marginal.

lvi

that of the star. Here the magnitude of the effects are positive and relatively large in magnitude, but also
imprecisely estimated.
We estimate a dynamic version of these specifications and display the corresponding event study-style graphs
in Figure G1 (publication output) and Figure G2 (grant output). In general, it appears from these figures
that the total output of related authors neither expands nor contracts in the wake of a star’s passing.
Therefore, the related articles contributed to the star’s subfields after they pass away most likely replace,
at least in part, articles that these authors would have written in other intellectual domains had the star
remained alive. Our results are therefore consistent with star extinction driving changes in the direction of
scientific research, rather than shifting the overall level of scientific activity.

Estimates stem from conditional (related author) fixed effects Poisson specifications. The dependent variable is either the publication output for a related, noncollaborating author in a particular year, or the number of distinct NIH grants awarded to that author awarded in a particular year. In the four leftmost columns,
each author is paired with the star with whom s/he had the highest number of related articles. In the four rightmost columns, each author is paired with the
star with whom s/he had the related article with the highest relatedness score. All models incorporate a full suite of year effects and investigator age effects, as
well as a term common to both treated and control authors that switches from zero to one after the death of the star. Exponentiating the coefficients and
differencing from one yield numbers interpretable as elasticities. Robust standard errors in parentheses double-clustered at the level of the star & related authors.
