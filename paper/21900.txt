Inequality of Subjective Well-Being as a Comprehensive Measure of Inequality

ABSTRACT
The link between happiness and overall inequality is best studied using an index that incorporates
different aspects of inequality, and is measured consistently in different countries. One such index
is the degree to which happiness itself varies among individuals. Its correlation with both
happiness levels and social trust is substantially stronger than the corresponding correlation for
income inequality. This remains so after allowing for bounded scale reporting, including a purely
ordinal measure of dispersion. Moreover, the correlation is stronger for individuals who profess
to care most about inequality. The link between happiness and inequality may thus be stronger
than previously appreciated.

I INTRODUCTION
Current research into the impact of inequality on happiness is focused on income inequality, typically using the Gini coefﬁcient of income as a proxy for
the level of inequality in a given state or country.1 This strategy has yielded
important insights, but it also has important limitations. People care not only
about inequality in income, but also about inequality in other domains, such
as legal rights, education, health, economic opportunities, housing, and social
networks.2 Even if we restrict attention to income, differences in how long or
how hard people choose to work can obscure differences in their true economic
opportunity set. There are further problems in comparing the level of inequality in different countries. The deﬁnition of income varies across countries, as
does the portion of personal consumption that individuals fund themselves.3
These factors introduce noise into the link between overall inequality and the
particular indicators (such as the Gini coefﬁcient) that we use in regressions.
When using income inequality as a regressor, we would obtain a bias towards
zero—underestimating how strongly happiness and inequality are related. In
addition, we would lose statistical power, reducing our ability to study small
samples or use demanding econometric techniques.
One approach to overcoming these limitations is to include additional regressors to represent inequality in other domains. But if our measure of income
inequality is problematic, measuring inequality in other domains is not going
to be any easier. The alternative is to look for an indicator of the quality of
life in its entirety, and use the dispersion of this indicator as the measure of inequality in a given society. Satisfaction with life (SWL) is such an indicator.
SWL is an index of well-being that incorporates all the different aspects of life
that the person cares about with the weights that he or she ascribes to them. It
is high if a person’s life is good, and is low if her life is bad. At the societal
level, SWL represents the distribution of (self-evaluated) life quality in that
society. SWL is high if life is good for members of that society, and is low
1

Alesina et al. (2004)—the best known paper in this ﬁeld—is a good example of this approach. Recently, Burkhauser et al. (2016) has retained the focus on income inequality, but
replaced the Gini coefﬁcient with a measure of income concentration at the top of the distribution.

if their life is not good. Its distribution is relatively concentrated in societies
whose members enjoy a similar quality of life, and is relatively dispersed if
some parts of society have a much better life than others.
Since SWL incorporates all the aspects of life, its dispersion can be seen as
a comprehensive measure of inequality—one that captures not only differences
in income, but also differences in leisure, education, legal rights, and other
aspects of life. By studying the link between SWL levels and SWL dispersion, we can test whether SWL and inequality are correlated, and in particular
whether high levels of inequality are associated with low levels of subjective
well-being (Figure 1). Since SWL dispersion is a comprehensive measure of
inequality, such a correlation will incorporate the possible impact not only of
income inequality, but also of inequality in other life domains.
The underlying causal links may be straightforward, but they could also
be quite elaborate. Inequality may cause resentment or sympathy, lowering
SWL through a direct causal link. But inequality can also affect SWL indirectly. For example, wealth disparities may engender differences in political
inﬂuence, which make the poor feel powerless. This feeling of powerlessness
can then reduce SWL even if the poor do not resent wealth disparities as such.
Indeed, inequality may reduce SWL even if people are not aware of the level
of inequality in their society—let alone the level of SWL inequality.4
We now have SWL data for about 150 countries going back to 2006, and
for at least some countries we have data going back to the 1970s. We are thus
able to study the link between SWL levels and SWL dispersion in most of
the countries in the world, including countries in which income data is unreliable or altogether missing. There is, however, a potential problem due to the
bounded scale on which SWL is reported. If the distribution of reported SWL
in countries with relatively high SWL is compressed against the upper bound
of the scale, we would obtain a downward bias in the correlation between average SWL and SWL dispersion (Figure 1c). Theoretically, this bias could result
in a spurious negative correlation between happiness and inequality. More realistically, it would bias our estimates of the true correlation, leading us to see
the negative relationship between happiness and inequality as stronger than it
really is.5 No measure is perfect, and if this bias is small, the advantages of
4

Some forms of inequality—such as inequality in legal rights—are more visible than others, and hence more likely to have a direct impact on SWL.

Measurement error is less of a concern in this case. In particular, suppose that individual
SWL is measured with a normally distributed error. The effect would be to shift the standard
deviation of the SWL distribution in each cluster upwards by the standard deviation of the

a negative correlation between the mean and dispersion of the SWL distribution. (c)
The bounded scale on which SWL is reported is a potential source of bias: the distribution in high SWL countries is censored, reducing the dispersion through a purely
mechanical channel that has nothing to do with the level of inequality.

the SWL dispersion measure of inequality could more than justify its use for
studying how SWL and inequality are related. But if the bias is large, we may
be better off setting SWL inequality aside, despite all its advantages.
We thus have a powerful and convenient measure of inequality, but it comes
with a potentially fatal weakness. Our goal in this paper is to evaluate this
weakness: should it be a deal-breaker, or is it a minor issue? Should researchers ignore SWL dispersion, or should they adopt it as the most empirically useful measure of overall inequality?
The measurement of SWL inequality was ﬁrst proposed by Veenhoven
(1990). The World Database of Happiness includes data on the standard deviation of happiness in various countries starting in 1946.6 Several papers have
studied changes in SWL inequality,7 but only a handful have examined its relationship with happiness levels (Delhey, 2004; Ott, 2005; Bolle et al., 2009;
Quick, 2015). All these studies have reported a strong negative correlation
between the two. For example, Ott (2005) studied a sample of 78 countries in
the World Values Survey, and found a strong correlation of 𝑟 = −0.65 between
the mean and standard deviation of the SWL distribution. Ott considered the
noise, making no difference whatsoever to regression results.

possibility that the correlation is purely mechanical, but dismissed it on the
grounds that it remained negative (𝑟 = −0.29) in the subsample of relatively
poor countries with GDP per capita of less than $10,000. Ott’s argument was
that the mean happiness in this group of countries was relatively distant from
the upper bound of the reporting scale, and that a mechanical relationship was
therefore unlikely.8 Quick (2015) also considered the mechanical correlation
problem, and concluded that “a much deeper understanding of these issues will
be required if well-being inequality is to be used robustly in the policy making
process.”
While the main contribution of this paper is to evaluate the possibility that
the observed correlations are largely (or even entirely) mechanical, we start
by establishing a baseline of correlations in a number of different surveys: the
European Social Survey, the World Values Survey, the Gallup World Poll, and
the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index (comparing U.S. states). Taken together, these surveys include over 160 countries and (for some of these countries) survey waves from 1990 to 2015. In order to regress SWL levels on
SWL dispersion we need to represent each of them with a single number. We
use the mean of the SWL distribution as our measure of SWL levels, and the
standard deviation as our measure of SWL dispersion. As a robustness check,
we investigate a purely ordinal measure of dispersion in Appendix A.
We estimate individual level regressions in clusters deﬁned by the combination of country/wave (state/wave in the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being
Index), and controls for log GDP per capita (in PPP terms), region dummies,
and personal variables: gender, age, education, employment, and marital status. Despite the inclusion of these controls, we replicate earlier ﬁndings of a
strong and strongly statistically signiﬁcant negative relationship between SWL
levels and dispersion in all the surveys.
If SWL dispersion does a better job of representing overall inequality than
do measures of income inequality, we would expect its correlation with SWL
levels to be stronger. We estimate corresponding regressions with income inequality replacing SWL dispersion, and conﬁrm that this is indeed the case.
Moreover, when we include both measures of inequality in the same regression, the coefﬁcient on income inequality is substantially reduced in magni8

“This negative correlation between level and inequality is, up to a point, a ‘ceiling effect’
since it is inevitable that inequality, as measured by standard deviation, will diminish if higher
average levels are reached. But this correlation is also visible in poor countries with lower
average levels and this arithmetical necessity does not predict that it really happens!” (Ott,
2005)

tude, but the coefﬁcient on SWL dispersion is unchanged.
Though interesting, these results do nothing to address the possibility of
a mechanical correlation bias. We evaluate this possibility with the help of
three tests. The ﬁrst exploits questions—available in two of the surveys we
use—that ask respondents whether they think income differences should be
reduced. We take this question as a measure of aversion to inequality, and test
whether the correlation between SWL levels and dispersion in subjects averse
to inequality is stronger than the corresponding correlation in other subjects.
We ﬁnd that this difference is large and statistically signiﬁcant. These results
are hard to reconcile with a purely mechanical correlation—which should not
differ between subjects who care about inequality and those who don’t, and
are exactly what we would expect if the correlation between SWL levels and
dispersion measures the true relationship between happiness and inequality.
Our second test uses a partialling out logic to control directly for the mechanical correlation effect. We regress social trust on SWL inequality, and
measure the change in the coefﬁcient when we add mean SWL as an additional regressor. Social trust is important for both happiness (Helliwell & Putnam, 2004; Helliwell & Wang, 2011) and economic growth (Knack & Keefer,
1997), and is strongly correlated with income inequality (Bjørnskov, 2007;
Rothstein & Uslaner, 2005). To the extent that SWL inequality measures overall inequality, we would expect it to be correlated with social trust, and the correlation coefﬁcient should not signiﬁcantly depend on whether mean SWL is a
regressor. By contrast, the mechanical component of the correlation with SWL
inequality is driven by mean SWL, and should disappear when conditioning
on the cluster mean of SWL. The results are that the coefﬁcient on SWL inequality is barely changed if mean SWL is added to the regression, consistent
with the real correlation interpretation. In the Gallup World Poll we also examine other well-being determinants: recent feelings of worry and stress, and
whether the respondent feels safe walking alone. Again we ﬁnd strong correlations with SWL inequality in the expected direction (more worry, stress,
and fear of walking alone), and only a small decline in the coefﬁcient when
mean SWL is added as a regressor. These results suggest that the correlations
with SWL inequality are almost entirely due to real correlations with overall
inequality, with only a very small role for a mechanical correlation effect.
Our third test is to estimate a bound on the size of the mechanical correlation on the assumption that the distribution of actual SWL extends beyond
the range on which SWL can be reported, and individuals choose the closest
integer to their actual SWL within the bounds of the reporting scale. The dis6

tribution of reported SWL in clusters with a high mean SWL is left skewed,
with a large majority of people reporting SWL values in the upper part of the
scale, a long left tail, and a much smaller right tail. If the distribution of actual
SWL is also left-skewed, there would be little or no censoring of actual values
at the upper end of the scale, and little or no mechanical correlation between
SWL levels and SWL dispersion. But if the distribution of actual SWL is symmetric and unbounded, the right tail would have to extend far beyond the end
of the scale to mirror the distribution within the reporting scale. Since reported
values are censored at ten, this would result in a large mechanical correlation
between SWL levels and SWL dispersion. Thus, an unbounded symmetric
distribution represents a reasonable “worst-case” for estimating the possible
extent of this mechanical correlation. We assume that the distribution of actual
SWL is logistic (the relatively fat tailed logistic distribution offers a better ﬁt
than a normal distribution). We ﬁnd the maximum likelihood mean and variance for each cluster, and compute the correlation between SWL levels and
SWL dispersion in actual SWL space. The correlation is about a third smaller
than the correlation in reported SWL space, suggesting that at least two thirds
of the correlation in reported SWL space is real, and cannot be explained away
as an artifact of the bounded reporting scale.
Finally, as an alternative to modelling the SWL reporting function we reestimate our main regressions using an ordinal measure of dispersion—the variation ratio (the proportion of observations not equal to the mode). Since this
is a weaker measure of dispersion than the standard deviation, we expect the
correlation to be weaker. Nevertheless, we obtain qualitatively the same results, providing yet more evidence that the correlation between SWL levels
and SWL dispersion is real.
We thus conclude that mechanical correlation plays only a small role in explaining the strong negative correlation between SWL levels and dispersion,
and is by no means a deal-breaker. Most of the correlation is real, suggesting
(i) that the degree of SWL dispersion is indeed a useful measure of overall
inequality, and (ii) that the true cross-country correlation between happiness
and overall inequality is large. Consider the magnitude of changes associated
with a one point increase in SWL. While the exact coefﬁcients vary among
the surveys, a one point change in SWL on a 0–10 scale is associated either
with a tripling of GDP per capita, or with a one point decrease in the standard
deviation of SWL. As an example, New Zealand’s GDP per capita is about
35% lower than in the United States, and the standard deviation of SWL is
about 0.3 points less. According to our estimated coefﬁcients, these two dif7

ferences in wealth and inequality are associated with comparable differences
in happiness. Indeed, according to the Gallup World Poll, the mean SWL in
2014 in the US was 7.28 and in New Zealand it was a nearly identical 7.35.
Denmark—the country with the world’s highest mean SWL level of 7.58—
has about the same GDP per capita as the United States and about the same
SWL dispersion as New Zealand. Our ﬁndings do not imply that the correlation between happiness and overall inequality is causal, but they do suggest
that researchers interested in the relationship between happiness and inequality
use SWL dispersion as their measure of overall inequality.

DATA

Section II.1 provides a general discussion of satisfaction with life data, and
the inter-personal comparability assumptions that are required in its analysis.
Section II.2 explains our use of the standard deviation to measure SWL dispersion. Section II.3 describes the SWL surveys we use. Section II.4 details
our sources for supporting macro data.

II.1

Satisfaction with life

We use the term satisfaction with life (SWL) to refer to a person’s overall evaluation of his or her life. A typical survey question is “All things considered,
how satisﬁed are you with your life as a whole nowadays?” with answers given
on a scale ranging from “extremely dissatisﬁed” to “extremely satisﬁed”. Another commonly used question, the Cantril Ladder, asks respondents to rank
their life between the worst and best possible life for them. Section II.3 describes the questions that are available in the surveys we analyze.
SWL provides a measure of individual welfare that includes all the things
a person cares about with the importance he or she assigns to them. The ﬁrst
well-known economics paper using SWL data as a proxy for welfare or utility is probably Easterlin (1974). The rate of publications has substantially
increased around 2005, with such papers as Luttmer (2005), Van Praag and
Baarsma (2005), Di Tella and MacCulloch (2006), Frey et al. (2007), Clark
et al. (2008), and Layard et al. (2008). Deaton (2010) advocates its use in
measuring international differences in poverty.
The use of SWL data raises two important concerns: interpersonal comparability and the linearity of the transformation between true utility and reported
8

SWL. To appreciate these concerns, let ℎ𝑗 denote the reported SWL of person
𝑗 , and let 𝑢𝑗 denote her actual SWL or welfare. The interpersonal comparability
problem is that different people could potentially use different transformations
to report their utility: ℎ𝑗 = 𝑓𝑗 (𝑢𝑗 ) and ℎ𝑘 = 𝑓𝑘 (𝑢𝑘 ) with 𝑓𝑗 ≠ 𝑓𝑘 . The linearity
problem is that OLS regressions with ℎ𝑗 as the dependent variable necessarily
assume that equal differences in reported SWL correspond to equal differences
in actual SWL, but that is only true if the reporting functions are linear.
There are three answers to these concerns. First, far from being a new and
questionable requirement of SWL studies, interpersonal comparisons of wellbeing are a normal and unavoidable assumption in everyday life. As Harsanyi
(1955) writes, “There is no doubt about the fact that people do make, or at least
attempt to make, interpersonal comparisons of utility, both in the sense of comparing different persons’ total satisfaction and in the sense of comparing increments and decrements in different persons’ satisfaction.” Second, research
shows that SWL reports correlate as expected with other people’s estimates,
with neuropsychological measures, and with external factors that are expected
to affect utility, and that they are in turn a good predictor of decisions, such as
quitting and marital break-up (Clark et al., 2008). Finally, national differences
in SWL are uncorrelated with ratings of hypothetical situations, implying that
SWL ratings do not merely reﬂect cultural differences in how people rate their
experiences (Bolle & Kemp, 2009).
In common with other SWL research, we take interpersonal comparability
for granted. Most importantly, we assume that any individual differences in
SWL reporting are uncorrelated with regressors: there is no systematic tendency for people in high inequality countries to report their SWL differently
than people in low inequality countries. Most of the analysis assumes linearity: equal differences in reported SWL correspond to equal differences in actual SWL. Relaxing linearity requires strong distributional assumptions (Clark
et al., 2008; Layard et al., 2008). Nevertheless, as a robustness check we test a
non-linear model (Section III.4.3) and an ordinal measure of SWL dispersion
(Section III.4.4).

II.2

Measuring inequality

We use the standard deviation of SWL as our primary indicator of SWL dispersion, and the Gini coefﬁcient of income for income inequality. One of the
key properties of the Gini coefﬁcient is scale invariance: changing the units

9

(or currency) in which income is measured makes no difference to the Gini
coefﬁcient. This is an important property, since it is difﬁcult to ensure that
income is measured in comparable units across clusters.
SWL is reported on the same scale in different countries, making scaleinvariance irrelevant. The key property in a measure of SWL dispersion is
invariance to additive shifts. Consider two clusters in which the distribution
of SWL is the same except for an additive shift, so that the mean is higher in
one cluster than in the other. We want our measure of dispersion to be the same
in both clusters. This is the case for the variance or standard deviation, but not
for the Gini coefﬁcient or the coefﬁcient of variation.9 The choice between the
standard deviation and the variance makes little practical difference. We follow the precedent in this literature (Veenhoven, 1990; Kalmijn & Veenhoven,
2005), and measure SWL dispersion by the standard deviation of the distribution. In Appendix A we include results using the variation ratio, which is
deﬁned as the proportion of observations not equal to the mode. The variation
ratio is a more noisy measure of dispersion than the standard deviation, but
as a purely ordinal measure of dispersion it provides an important robustness
test.

II.3

SWL surveys

We use data from four surveys: the World Values Survey (WVS), the European Social Survey (ESS), the Gallup World Poll (GWP), and the GallupHealthways Well-Being Index (GHWBI). Table 1 summarizes key statistics
about these surveys. The sections below provide more details.
European Social Survey
The European Social Survey10 includes 36 European countries and Israel. We
use waves 1-7 with data from 2006 to 2015 with a total of 303,385 individual
SWL observations. The SWL variable is life satisfaction (stflife), which
is recorded on a 0–10 scale, with end points labelled Extremely dissatisﬁed
and Extremely satisﬁed. Clusters are deﬁned by the combination of country
(cntry) and wave (essround). The interview year (inwyye, inwyr, inwyys,

These last two measures are reduced by a positive additive shift. Using these measures
would therefore result in a mechanical negative correlation between happiness and inequality
even if the reporting scale is unbounded!

and maritalb), and unemployment (unemp3m and unempla). We use poststratiﬁcation weights (pspwght) for weighting, except in wave 7 when only
design weights (dweight) are available. We use the variable gincdif as measuring a preference for equality. Subjects were asked to record their agreement
or disagreement with the following statement: “The government should take
measures to reduce differences in income levels”. Answers were originally
on a 5 point scale ranging from Agree strongly to Disagree strongly, which
we invert to a −2 to +2 range, with +2 denoting strong agreement. The trust
variable ppltrst is a 0–10 variable with endpoints labelled You can’t be too
careful and Most people can be trusted.
World Values Survey
The World Values Survey includes data from 98 countries. We use waves 1-6
with data from 1981 to 2014 with a total of 314,903 individual SWL observations.11 The SWL variable we use is life satisfaction (A170) reported on
a 1–10 scale with endpoints labelled Dissatisﬁed and Satisﬁed. Clusters are
deﬁned by the combination of country (S003) and wave (S002). The interview
year (S020) is used for matching with macro variables. Personal controls include gender (X001), age (X003), education (X025) and marital status (X007).
Weights are given by S017. The variable E035 codes a preference for equality.
Subjects were asked to report their view on a 1 to 10 scale with 1 labelled “Incomes should be made more equal” and 10 labelled “We need larger income
differences as incentives for individual effort”. We inverted this scale, so that
higher values denote a preference for equality. Finally, the trust variable A165
is a binary question, asking people whether “Most people can be trusted” or
“you can’t be too careful”. We recode it so that a positive value denotes agreement with “Most people can be trusted”.

in 2001 and 2006, as these particular surveys did not use the full SWL range.

Gallup World Poll
The Gallup World Poll12 includes data from over 160 countries. We used the
December 2014 version of the dataset, which includes data for every year from
2008 to 2014, and about 1.34 million individual observations. The SWL variable is the Cantril Ladder of Life (WP16) recorded on a 0–10 scale with end
points labelled “Worst possible life for you” and “Best possible life for you”.
Clusters are deﬁned by the combination of country code (ccode) and the interview year (YEAR_CALENDAR). Personal controls include gender (WP1219), age
(WP1220), and marital status (WP1223). We use wgt for weighting observations.
As in the World Values Survey, the trust variable WP9039 is binary, asking
whether “most people can be trusted” or “you have to be careful in dealing
with people”. We recoded answers so that a positive value denotes agreement
with “most people can be trusted”. The emotions data we use includes the following variables: WP60 (well-rested), WP67 (enjoyment), WP69 (worry), WP70
(sadness), WP71 (stress), WP74 (anger), and WP6878 (happiness). These are all
binary questions, asking whether the respondent experienced that particular
emotion in the previous 24 hours.
Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index
The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index13 includes data from the United
States with enough observations for useful statistics at the state level. We use
the May 2012 version of the dataset, which includes data for every year from
2008 to 2011 and a total of 1.4 million individual SWL observations. The subjective well-being variable is the Cantril Ladder of Life recorded on a 0–10
scale. Clusters are deﬁned by the combination of state (zipstate) and the interview year (obtained from the interview date, int_date). Personal controls
include gender (sc7), age (age), marital status (wp1223) and education (d4).
We use weight for weighting observations.

Macro data

We use the World Bank’s World Development Indicators14 as our primary
source for GDP per capita and income inequality data in different countries.

GDP per capita is in constant prices adjusted for purchasing power parity. Income inequality is measured by the Gini coefﬁcient of income. When data are
missing, we interpolate linearly using the nearest data points when we have
both more recent and older data, and use the most recent data available when
we only have older data. At the opposite end, the World Bank data we use starts
at 1990, and some World Values Survey observations are for earlier years. We
use GDP data from version 8.1 of the Penn World Tables to ﬁll in the missing
years.15 For the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index we need US state level
information. We use the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
for Gini coefﬁcients, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis for GDP.16
We use GDP per capita as an income control, since it is available in comparable form for all surveys. We have used household income data from the
European Social Survey (ESS) and Gallup World Poll (GWP) for robustness
checks against the possibility that the use of aggregate income might bias upwards our estimate of the effects of SWL inequality on average SWL. In the
ESS sample our estimates of the effects of SWL inequality are actually higher
using logs of household incomes, national means of the logs of household incomes, or logs of the national means of household incomes than they are using
log GDP. The GWP results are more mixed, but for both surveys the sign and
signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcients on SWL inequality as well as the results comparing SWL inequality and income inequality reported below are unchanged
by using any of the alternative income measures.

III ANALYSIS
Section III.1 discusses some general issues common to all our regressions.
Section III.2 describes the baseline regressions that establish the partial correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion. Section III.3 describes the
comparison with income inequality. Finally, Section III.4 describes the tests
for whether the correlation between SWL levels and dispersion is real.

https://pwt.sas.upenn.edu. We use data from the earliest year in which we have GDP data
from both sources (1990 for most countries) to normalize the Penn data that we use for years
prior to 1990. This corrects for differences in the GDP, purchasing power, and population
ﬁgures that the two datasets use, as well as for the across-the-board difference in the base
year.

III.1 Considerations common to all regressions
Previous work on the relationship between SWL levels and SWL dispersion
has used cluster level regressions, with one observation per cluster (Delhey,
2004; Ott, 2005; Bolle et al., 2009; Quick, 2015). Our data has individual level
observations, however, including (in two of the surveys) information about
the individual’s own attitude towards inequality. In order to take advantage of
this information, we estimate individual level regressions with standard errors
corrected for clustering. SWL inequality, income inequality, and log GDP per
capita are measured in clusters deﬁned by the combination of geographic unit
(country or state) and time (survey wave or year). Observations with ambiguous values (“no answer”, “don’t know”) are treated as missing.

III.2

Baseline correlations in different surveys

Our baseline regression tests whether the correlations found in previous research (Delhey, 2004; Ott, 2005; Bolle et al., 2009) remain when we control
for GDP per capita, as well as personal and region controls:
ℎ𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝜎 𝜎𝑖 + 𝛽𝑌 𝑌𝑖 +

∑

𝛾𝑘 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 ,

(1)

𝑘

where ℎ𝑖𝑗 denotes the reported SWL of person 𝑗 in cluster 𝑖, 𝜎𝑖 denotes the standard deviation of SWL in this cluster, 𝑌𝑖 is the logarithm of GDP per capita
in PPP terms, and 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑘 are personal controls for gender, age, education, employment, and marital status. In the World Values Survey and Gallup World
Poll we also add region dummies in order to control for between-region differences in SWL levels.17 Given previous research, the expectation is that
𝛽𝜎 is negative. We also estimate a regression with geographic unit (country or
state) dummies. This regression controls for any ﬁxed differences in SWL levels between countries (including any ﬁxed reporting biases), testing whether
changes in SWL levels are correlated with changes in SWL dispersion.

III.3

Comparing income inequality with SWL dispersion

If SWL dispersion is a comprehensive measure of inequality, its correlation
with individual well-being should be better identiﬁed than the corresponding

Regions include: (i) the West (Europe, North America, and Oceania), (ii) Latin America,
(iii) Asia, (iv) Middle East and North Africa, and (v) Sub-Saharan Africa.

15

correlation for income inequality, or other less general measures of inequality.
We estimate a variation of Equation 1 with the Gini coefﬁcient of income, 𝑔𝑖
replacing 𝜎𝑖 :
ℎ𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑔 𝑔𝑖 + 𝛽𝑌 𝑌𝑖 +
𝛾 𝑥 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 ,
(2)
∑ 𝑘 𝑖𝑗𝑘
𝑘

and a combined regression with both measures of inequality:
ℎ𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝜎 𝜎𝑖 + 𝛽𝑔 𝑔𝑖 + 𝛽𝑌 𝑌𝑖 +

∑

𝛾𝑘 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 .

(3)

𝑘

The hypotheses in Equation 3 are that the correlation with 𝜎𝑖 remains signiﬁcant: 𝛽𝜎 < 0, and is larger in magnitude than the corresponding correlation
with income inequality: |𝛽𝜎 | > |𝛽𝑔 |.

III.4

Testing for a mechanical correlation bias

III.4.1

Is the correlation stronger in subjects who care more about inequality?

Our ﬁrst test exploits information about the degree to which different people
care about income inequality, and by extension the degree to which they care
about inequality in general. The World Values Survey and the European Social
Survey ask respondents whether income differences should be reduced, with
answers on a 5 level scale. The distribution of responses is far from uniform,
with about three quarters of responders either agreeing or strongly agreeing
with this statement. Nevertheless, there is enough variation for a useful indicator of how much a given responder cares about income inequality.
We estimate the following equation, where 𝑒𝑖𝑗 denotes person’s 𝑖 level of
agreement that inequality should be reduced:
ℎ𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝜎 𝜎𝑖 + 𝛽𝑔 𝑔𝑖 + 𝛽𝑒 𝑒𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽𝑒𝜎 𝑒𝑖𝑗 𝜎𝑖 + 𝛽𝑒𝑔 𝑒𝑖𝑗 𝑔𝑖+ 𝛽𝑌 𝑌𝑖 +

∑

𝛾𝑘 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 . (4)

𝑘

Our interest is in the interaction term 𝛽𝑒𝜎 . If the correlation between SWL
levels and dispersion is real, and if attitudes towards income inequality are
strongly correlated with attitudes towards inequality in general, we would expect 𝛽𝑒𝜎 to be negative (stronger correlation among responders who care more
about inequality). If, however, the correlation is primarily a mechanical artifact of the way SWL is reported, 𝛽𝑒𝜎 should be insigniﬁcantly different from
zero.
16

III.4.2

Partialling out the mechanical effect of mean SWL

Several of the datasets we use include measures of such SWL determinants as
social trust and various emotions that are known to be correlated with the level
of inequality. If SWL dispersion is a good measure of inequality, we would
expect these variables to be correlated with SWL dispersion, and we would
not expect this correlation to change signiﬁcantly if we add SWL levels as a
control. If, however, the correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion
is mechanical, these variables should only be correlated with SWL dispersion
through their correlation with SWL levels. In that case we would expect this
correlation to be relatively small, and to disappear entirely if SWL levels are
added as a control.
For a well-being determinant 𝑤𝑖𝑗 we estimate the following two regressions:
𝑤𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝜎 𝜎𝑖 + 𝛽𝑌 𝑌𝑖 +
𝛾 𝑥 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 ,
(5)
∑ 𝑘 𝑖𝑗𝑘
𝑘

and
𝑤𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 ′ + 𝛽𝜇 𝜇𝑖 + 𝛽𝜎′ 𝜎𝑖 + 𝛽𝑌′ 𝑌𝑖 +

∑

𝛾𝑘′ 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗′ ,

(6)

𝑘

where 𝜇𝑖 denotes the mean SWL level in cluster 𝑖. If SWL dispersion is a
good measure of inequality, we would expect 𝛽𝜎 in Equation 5 to be negative.
Since 𝜇𝑖 is positively correlated with 𝑤𝑖𝑗 , we should not be surprised if the
correlation is weakened when 𝜇𝑖 is added to the regression (Equation 6), but it
should remain negative:
𝛽𝜎 ≤ 𝛽𝜎′ < 0.
(7)
Suppose, instead, that SWL dispersion has nothing to do with inequality, so
that the correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion is purely mechanical (Figure 1). If that were the case, any correlation between 𝑤𝑖𝑗 and 𝜎𝑖
would be mediated by 𝜇𝑖 , and should largely disappear when 𝜇𝑖 is added as a
control in Equation 6:18
𝛽𝜎 < 𝛽𝜎′ ≈ 0.
(8)
The ﬁrst well-being determinant we test is social trust. Survey questions
on social trust have been validated by correlating answers with cross-country
differences in the frequency with which experimentally dropped wallets were
18

If the mechanical component of the correlation is a linear function of 𝜇𝑖 it should disappear
entirely by the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem.

17

returned (Knack & Keefer, 1997). Responses are available as a 0–10 numeric
variable in the European Social Survey (ESS), and as a binary variable in the
World Values Survey (WVS) and Gallup World Poll (GWP). There is no trust
question in the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. In ESS we estimate
linear regressions, and in WVS and GWP we estimate a logit regression.
The other well-being determinants we use are yes/no questions on worry
and stress in the previous day, and a question on whether the respondent fears
walking alone. These questions are only available in the Gallup World Poll. As
these are yes/no questions we use logit regressions. Since they are negatively
related to well-being, they are predicted to increase in SWL inequality. The
hypotheses in Equations 7 and 8 are therefore reversed, and 𝛽𝜎 and 𝛽𝜎′ are
predicted to be positive.
III.4.3

Modelling the SWL reporting function

Actual SWL may best be thought of as a continuous variable, but SWL reports
are restricted to integers in a bounded range, such as 0–10. As we note in the
introduction and in Figure 1, the censoring and quantization could, in principle,
create a mechanical correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion that
has nothing to do with the level of inequality. Our approach in this section is
to model the reporting function and reestimate the regressions of Section III.2
in actual SWL space.
This approach necessitates identifying assumptions on the distribution of
actual SWL. Since our goal is to estimate a bound on the portion of the correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion that is mechanical, we assume that the distribution of actual SWL is symmetric. As the distribution
of reported SWL is left-skewed, this assumption implies that the right tail of
the distribution is censored, resulting in mechanical correlation between SWL
levels and SWL dispersion. If, instead, the distribution of actual SWL is as
left-skewed as the distribution of reported SWL, there would be little or no
censoring, and little or no mechanical correlation. The symmetric distribution assumption can thus be seen as providing an upper bound on the likely
mechanical correlation effect.
The two commonly used symmetric distributions are the normal and logistic distributions. We chose the logistic distribution as it ﬁts the data better. We
use maximum likelihood to estimate the mean 𝜇𝑖∗ and standard deviation 𝜎𝑖∗ in

18

each cluster 𝑖. We then estimate an analogue of Equation 1,
ℎ̄ ∗𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 ∗ + 𝛽𝜎∗ 𝜎𝑖∗ + 𝛽𝑌∗ 𝑌𝑖 +

∑

𝛾𝑘∗ 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗∗ ,

(9)

𝑘

where ℎ̄ ∗𝑖𝑗 is the expected value in the distribution of actual SWL values that
are consistent with the SWL report ℎ𝑖𝑗 .
The coefﬁcient 𝛽𝜎∗ in Equation 9 can then be compared with the corresponding coefﬁcient 𝛽𝜎 in Equation 1. If actual SWL is negatively correlated with
inequality, 𝛽𝜎∗ should be negative. If, however, 𝛽𝜎 is only negative because of
the non-linearity in the reporting function, we would expect 𝛽𝜎∗ to be zero. If
the correlation is partly real and partly mechanical, we may expect 𝛽𝜎∗ to be
negative, but smaller in magnitude than 𝛽𝜎 .
The estimates of the mechanical correlation component that are obtained
using this method are driven by the difference between the distribution of reported SWL and our assumptions on the distribution of actual SWL. The distribution of reported SWL in most countries is left skewed. In a typical country,
the mode may be at 7 on a 0-10 scale, with a large majority of respondents
reporting a value of 6 or above, but some respondents reporting values as low
as 0 or 1. Our assumption that actual SWL is symmetrically distributed explains this left skew as the result of non-linearities in the reporting function.
There are, however, good reasons to expect the distribution of actual SWL to
be left skewed. In particular, common mental health problems such as anxiety
and depression can cause people to be far less happy with their lives, adding a
left skew to what might otherwise be an approximately symmetric distribution.
The absence of satiation in SWL regressions also argues against non-linearities
in the reporting function (Stevenson & Wolfers, 2013). We should thus expect this estimation procedure to overestimate the mechanical component of
the correlation between SWL and inequality, or equivalently, to underestimate
the true correlation that we are interested in.
III.4.4

Ordinal measure of SWL dispersion

Finally, we repeat the regressions of Sections III.2, III.3 and III.4.1 using the
variation ratio measure of SWL dispersion (Section II.2).

19

IV RESULTS
Section IV.1 reports the results of all satisfaction with life regressions: the
baseline regressions (Section III.1), the corresponding regressions with income inequality (Section III.3), and the regressions testing whether the correlation between the mean and dispersion of the SWL distribution is stronger
among those responders who describe themselves as more concerned with inequality (Section III.4.1). Section IV.2 turns to regressions of SWL components in which we partial out the effect of mean SWL (Section III.4.2). Section IV.3 describes the results of modelling the SWL reporting function to
estimate the correlation between the mean and dispersion of the SWL distribution in actual SWL space (Section III.4.3). Appendix A reports results with
the variation measure of SWL dispersion.

IV.1 Satisfaction with life regressions
The results of the regressions are qualitatively similar in all four surveys: SWL
dispersion is strongly negatively correlated with SWL despite the inclusion of
GDP per capita and other controls; the corresponding correlation with income
inequality is consistently weaker; the correlation is stronger among those particularly concerned with inequality, consistent with the hypothesis that this
correlation is not mechanical, but real, capturing the true correlation between
SWL and comprehensive inequality. The following sections describe the results for each survey in turn.
European Social Survey
The results for the European Social Survey are in Table 2. The partial correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion is negative: 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.21 and
is strongly statistically signiﬁcant (𝑝 ≪ 0.001). The corresponding correlation
with the Gini coefﬁcient of income (Column 2) is also statistically signiﬁcant (𝑝 < 0.001), but the standardized beta coefﬁcient is only a third in size:
𝛽𝑔̂ = −0.07 as compared with 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.21. When both measures of inequality
are included in the same regression (Column 3), the Gini coefﬁcient drops to
insigniﬁcance, whereas the coefﬁcient on SWL dispersion is hardly changed:
𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.20. Column 4 adds the subjective importance of reducing inequality
and its interaction with SWL and income inequality. As expected, the inter̂ = −0.22 (𝑝 < 0.001), but
action term with SWL dispersion is negative: 𝛽𝑒𝜎
20

the interaction term with income inequality is insigniﬁcant and of the wrong
sign. The interaction term with SWL dispersion remains negative even when
country dummies are included (Column 5). In summary, the correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion is consistently negative in both the
cross-section and across time, is more negative than the correlation between
SWL levels and income inequality, and is stronger among those who describe
themselves as particularly averse to inequality.
World Values Survey
The results for the World Value Survey (Table 3) are not as strong, but are
otherwise similar to the European Social Survey results. The partial correlation with SWL dispersion is 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.17 (𝑝 ≪ 0.001). The corresponding
correlation with income inequality (Column 2) is also negative (𝛽𝑔̂ = −0.05),
but is not statistically signiﬁcant (𝑝 < 0.268). When both forms of inequality are included in the same regression (Column 3), the coefﬁcient on SWL
dispersion is virtually unchanged: 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.17 and the coefﬁcient on income
inequality remains insigniﬁcant. The interaction term with the importance of
̂ = −0.17 (𝑝 < 0.001), and this reSWL dispersion (Column 4) is negative: 𝛽𝑒𝜎
̂ = −0.13
mains the case when country dummies are added (Column 6) with 𝛽𝑒𝜎
(𝑝 < 0.001).
Gallup World Poll
The correlations in the Gallup World Poll (Table 4) are mostly similar to those
of the previous two surveys, though income inequality is more signiﬁcant than
in the other two surveys. The partial correlation between SWL levels with
SWL dispersion is 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.10 (𝑝 ≪ 0.001). The corresponding correlation with income inequality (Column 2) is also statistically signiﬁcant, but
weaker: 𝛽𝑔̂ = −0.06. When both inequality measures are included in the
same regression (Column 3), 𝛽𝑔̂ drops in magnitude to -0.04 (𝑝 < 0.006),
while 𝛽𝜎̂ is unchanged: 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.10 (𝑝 < 0.001). When country dummies are
added (Column 4) 𝛽𝜎̂ drops to −0.05 but remains strongly statistically signiﬁcant (𝑝 < 0.001). Interestingly, the coefﬁcient on income inequality becomes
stronger: 𝛽𝑔̂ = −0.09.

Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index
Results in the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index (Table 5) are also qualitatively similar. The partial correlation with SWL dispersion is 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.05
(𝑝 ≪ 0.001). Income inequality is not statistically signiﬁcant (Column 2).
When both forms of inequality are included (Column 3) the coefﬁcient on SWL
dispersion is unchanged: 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.06, while the coefﬁcient on income inequality is statistically signiﬁcant (𝑝 < 0.005) but with an unexpected positive sign
(𝛽𝑔̂ = 0.02). Adding state dummies (Column 4) causes a sharp reduction in the
coefﬁcient on SWL dispersion: 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.13, but it remains strongly statistically
signiﬁcant.

IV.2 Partialling out the mechanical effect of mean SWL
This section reports the results of the partialling out analysis of Section III.4.2.
The results for social trust are in Table 6. The six columns are in pairs corre25

sponding to the three surveys that include social trust questions: the European
Social Survey (ESS), the World Values Survey (WVS), and the Gallup World
Poll (GWP). Consistent with our hypotheses, social trust is strongly negatively
correlated with SWL dispersion in all three surveys (Columns 1, 3, and 5). Income inequality, by contrast, is borderline statistically signiﬁcant in the ESS
and WVS, and completely insigniﬁcant in the GWP. When mean SWL in the
cluster is added to the equation (Columns 2, 4, and 6) the coefﬁcient on SWL
dispersion is completely unchanged in the WVS, and only marginally reduced
in size in the other two surveys: from −0.25 to −0.21 in the ESS, and from
−0.25 to −0.22 in the GWP. In all three cases the coefﬁcient remains strongly
signiﬁcant (𝑝 < 0.001 in ESS and GWP, and 𝑝 < 0.01 in WVS). Table 7 reports
the results for worry, stress, and fear of walking alone. As expected, SWL dispersion is positively correlated with worry, stress, and fear of walking alone
(Columns 1, 3 and 5). As with social trust (Table 6) the magnitude of the correlation remains strongly statistically signiﬁcant (𝑝 < 0.001) when mean SWL
is added to the regressions, and is barely changed in size (Columns 2, 4, and
6).
The results in this section are consistent: a small to non-existent change in
the magnitude of the correlation with SWL dispersion with mean SWL is added
to the regression. It follows that only a small component of the correlation
is mediated by mean SWL, and that the bulk of the correlation captures the
true correlation with comprehensive inequality, rather than any mechanical
correlation effect.

IV.3 Modelling the SWL reporting function
Table 8 compares the results of the logistic distribution model of Section III.4.3
with the corresponding linear model. The distribution of SWL is a little wider
in the logistic model in all the surveys, both across and within clusters (the
latter resulting in a higher level of SWL dispersion). This result is consistent
with some systematic distortion due to the censoring inherent in SWL reports.
Consequently, it is not surprising that the regression coefﬁcient on SWL dispersion is smaller in size in the logistic model, though it remains strongly statistically signiﬁcant in all the surveys. The greatest decrease is in World Values
Survey, with the regression coefﬁcient decreasing in size from 𝛽𝜎̂ = −0.17 to
𝛽𝜎∗̂ = −0.10.
These results suggest that up to a third of the correlation between SWL

and SWL dispersion may be an artifact of the reporting function. As argued in
Section III.4.3, this estimate should be seen as an upper bound. It is entirely
possible that the left skew observed in the distribution of reported SWL is also
a feature of actual SWL. If that’s the case, there may be no distortion in mean
SWL, and no mechanical component to the observed correlation between SWL
and SWL dispersion.

V DISCUSSION
We set out in this paper to test the proposition that SWL dispersion offers a
comprehensive measure of inequality—one that subsumes the many and var29

ious component forms of inequality in particular domains. We started our investigation by replicating and extending previous ﬁndings that countries with
high mean SWL tend to have a substantially lower SWL dispersion, showing that these correlations remain strong when controlling for GDP per capita,
and are much better statistically identiﬁed than the corresponding correlations
between SWL and income inequality. When both forms of inequality are included in the regression, the coefﬁcient on SWL dispersion is little changed.
These results all suggest that SWL dispersion adds to the information provided
by income inequality in important ways.
While these results were encouraging, they do little to allay the concern that
the correlation between the mean and standard deviation of the SWL distribution may be a mechanical artifact—higher SWL levels causing a censoring of
the reported SWL distribution, and hence a lower dispersion. We employed
three different tests to address this concern. In the ﬁrst, we found that the correlation is substantially stronger among respondents who claim to be particularly
concerned with inequality—as should be the case if the correlation is real, but
not if it is merely a mechanical artifact. In the second, we examined the correlation between SWL dispersion and subjective well-being determinants such
as social trust that are known to be correlated with inequality. We found that
this correlation is large, and that it remains nearly as large when mean SWL
is added as a control. Since the purported mechanical correlation is caused by
high mean SWL, this result demonstrates that the mechanical correlation can
only explain a small part of the correlation between the mean and dispersion
of the SWL distribution. In our third and ﬁnal test, we modelled the mapping
from actual to reported SWL, enabling us to estimate the distribution of actual
SWL in different countries, and compute the correlation between the mean and
dispersion of the SWL distribution in actual SWL space. Using this method
we estimated that at least two thirds of the observed correlation between the
mean and dispersion of reported SWL is real, and that no more than a third of
the correlation could be mechanical. Finally, we repeated our main regressions
using a purely ordinal measure of dispersion—the variation ratio—conﬁrming
that the correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion does not depend
on the use of a cardinal measure of dispersion.
Our ﬁndings support the use of SWL dispersion as a comprehensive measure of inequality. The correlations with SWL levels are much better identiﬁed
than the corresponding correlations with income inequality, and the mechanical component of the correlation is small. SWL dispersion provides two important advantages for empirical researchers: one conceptual and the other
30

practical. The conceptual advantage is that it offers a comprehensive measure
of inequality that includes much more than the inequality of income. The practical advantage is consistent measurement in different countries and different
periods of time, making it possible to compare the level of inequality in any of
the 150 or so countries covered by SWL surveys. We thus hope that our results
would encourage other researchers to use SWL dispersion when studying the
impact of inequality on subjective well-being.
We conclude by noting that alongside GDP per capita, SWL dispersion
can explain a substantial portion of the variance in SWL levels among rich
countries. The countries with the highest level of SWL, such as Denmark, are
characterized by a high level of GDP per capita and a low SWL dispersion. At
the opposite end, countries such as Portugal and Greece are characterized by
a low level of GDP per capita and high SWL dispersion. The United States
has a GDP per capita as high as Denmark, but a much higher level of SWL
dispersion. Its mean SWL level is substantially lower than that of Denmark,
and is a little lower than New Zealand—a country with a much lower GDP per
capita, but also with a much lower level of SWL dispersion. Needless to say,
correlation does not imply causation. But whatever econometric techniques
researchers may wish to use, SWL dispersion deserves a place in their toolkit.

THE VARIATION RATIO MEASURE OF
SWL DISPERSION

This appendix includes tables corresponding to those of Section IV.1, but with
the ordinal variation ratio measure of SWL dispersion instead of the cardinal
standard deviation used in Section IV.1. If the correlation between SWL levels and the standard deviation of SWL is an artifact of the reporting scale, we
would expect the correlation to disappear when using an ordinal measure of
dispersion, such as the variation ratio. Instead, we ﬁnd essentially the same results as in Section IV.1. Of course, since the variation ratio is a noisier measure
of dispersion, we can expect the correlation between SWL levels and SWL dispersion to be somewhat weaker. Moreover, when both SWL dispersion and
the Gini coefﬁcient of income are included in the same regression, we can expect the correlation between SWL levels and the Gini coefﬁcient of income to
be weaker. This is exactly what we ﬁnd.
