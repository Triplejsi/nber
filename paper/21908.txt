ABSTRACT
Recent evidence indicates that boys and girls are differently affected by the quantity and quality of
family inputs received in childhood. We assess whether this is also true for schooling inputs. Using
matched Florida birth and school administrative records, we estimate the causal effect of school quality
on the gender gap in educational outcomes by contrasting opposite-sex siblings who attend the same
sets of schools—thereby purging family heterogeneity—and leveraging within-family variation in
school quality arising from family moves. Investigating middle school test scores, absences and suspensions,
we find that boys benefit more than girls from cumulative exposure to higher quality schools.

Introduction
Women have surpassed men in educational attainment throughout the developed world during the
last several decades. In 2011, the ratio of female to male college completion rates exceeded unity in
29 of 34 OECD countries, with just Chile, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico and Turkey having higher
rates of male college completion. In the United States, the female high school graduation rate at
present exceeds the male rate by five percentage points, and the female college graduation rate
exceeds the male rate by seven percentage points (Autor and Wasserman, 2013).
What explains these gender gaps in educational attainment? Recent evidence indicates that boys
and girls are differently affected by the quantity and quality of inputs received in childhood: Bertrand
and Pan (2013) document that boys raised in single-parent families have twice the rates of behavioral
and disciplinary issues as boys raised in two-parent families; Autor et al. (2015) demonstrate that
while disadvantage is unrelated to the gender gap in neonatal health, the boy-girl gap in kindergarten
readiness, test scores, truancy, disciplinary problems, disability, juvenile delinquency, and high school
graduations is larger the more disadvantaged the family; Fan, Fang and Markussen (2015) report that
maternal employment during early childhood reduces boys’ eventual educational attainment relative
to that of girls; Chetty and Hendren (2015) conclude that boys’ economic mobility is differentially
adversely affected by childhood residence in low-mobility communities; and Campbell et al. (2014)
and Conti, Heckman and Pinto (2015) find that intensive early childhood educational programs
implemented in the 1960s and 1970s differentially improved boys’ health and health behaviors.
While current literature focuses primarily on the effects of early childhood influences on the
gender gap, much less is known about whether boys and girls are differentially affected by school
quality. A limited body of evidence suggests that attributes of schools may affect boys and girls
differently. For instance, Dee (2005) shows that students perform better with same-sex teachers;
and since the majority of classroom teachers are female, this could contribute to gender differences
in schooling outcomes. Legewie and DiPrete (2012) find that boys’ development or inhibition of
anti-school attitudes and behavior is much more sensitive to peer socio-economic status, which is
correlated with many measures of school quality. Machin and McNally (2008) document that focused
teaching in literacy or numeracy in primary school differentially benefits the sex with weaker average
performance—literacy among boys and numeracy among girls.
On the other hand, school choice lottery evidence from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina public school system indicates a differential benefit to girls in at least one measure of school
quality. Hastings, Kane and Staiger (2006) report that white females’ test scores increase if they
receive their first choice lottery school whereas whereas white males’ scores are unaffected. Building
on this evidence, Deming et al. (2014) find that the postsecondary attainment benefits accruing
from attending first-choice high schools are concentrated among girls rather than boys, and that
girls make more use of the options available to them at more demanding high schools (e.g., access
to college-level coursework).
We complement this disparate evidence by providing an unusually powerful and tightly controlled
omnibus test of the causal effect of school quality on the gender gap in test scores and behavioral
1

outcomes. Using population-level matched birth and school administrative records for tens of thousands of sibling pairs attending thousands of Florida public schools, we contrast the outcomes of
opposite-sex siblings who attend the same sets of schools (‘concordant school’ siblings). This sibling level contrast purges unmeasured family heterogeneity while identifying the differential effect
of school quality on boys relative to girls. Complementing this strategy, we contrast outcomes of
siblings exposed to schools of differing quality levels due (exclusively) to family moves across Florida
school catchment areas. Investigating both middle school academic and behavioral outcomes, we
find that boys benefit more from cumulative exposure to higher-quality schools—measured using
school level gain scores in reading and mathematics—than do their sisters.

1

Characterizing School Quality and Gender Gaps in Middle School
Outcomes

We draw on data from the universe of birth certificates from the state of Florida for years 1994
through 2002, sourced from the Florida Bureau of Vital Statistics, matched to public school records
for academic years 1995-96 through 2012-13 from the Florida Department of Education Data Warehouse.1 We focus on three outcomes observed for each student in grades six through eight: standardized math and reading scores from the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT); absenteeism
rates; and the incidence of school suspension. We use school-level gain scores calculated by the
Florida Department of Education—measuring schools’ average contribution to student outcomes—
to measure the quality of elementary and middle schools.2 For each school, we compute a simple
average of the observed gain scores between 2002 and 2013, which we then convert into a percentile
rank in the observed gains distribution across Florida schools. For each student, we construct the
cumulative quality of schools attended from grade one forward, equal to a years-weighted average of
the rank quality of all schools attended to that point. To limit the potential role of the endogeneity
of school choices within families, we exclude from the sample the 20.8 percent of families in which
children of elementary (middle) school age attend different elementary (middle) schools in the same
academic year.
Panels A and B of Table 1 present summary statistics for academic and behavioral outcomes, and
the gender gap in these outcomes, by quartiles of cumulative school quality. Academic outcomes are
strongly positively correlated—and behavioral outcomes negatively correlated—with school quality,
as expected. Panel C reports summary statistics for the family background characteristics that are
included as regression controls. The quality of the schools a child attends is positively correlated
with her family’s socioeconomic status, including mother’s education, mother’s marital status, and
income of neighborhood of residence at birth.
1

Figlio et al. (2014) provide further details on the matching process.
We average the three gain score measures consistently produced over the entire period—percent making gains in
reading, percent making gains in math, and percent of bottom quartile students making gains in reading—which are
available for download at schoolgrades.fldoe.org. Results are similar if we also consider the proficiency-based measures
used by the state to grade schools.

Figure 1 provides initial evidence suggesting a school quality gradient in the gender gap in
schooling outcomes. This figure plots average combined FCAT reading and math scores by sex
against school quality percentile for the siblings in our sample. For both boys and girls, we observe
a strong, positive linear relationship between the quality of schools attended and student academic
achievement. This relationship is expected, given the strong correlation between school quality and
student demographics reported in Table 1. More intriguingly, there is a modest but nevertheless
pronounced female-favorable gap in the test scores among students who attend the lowest quality
schools that contracts to zero as one moves upward in the school quality distribution. This pattern
is not directly predicted by the correlation between school quality and student demographics since
demographics are balanced across genders within schools.3
Conversely, there is a steep negative relationship between school quality and absences/suspensions
(Figure 2), with an even more pronounced narrowing of the gender gap as one moves from a lower to
a higher quality school. Among students who attended the lowest decile of school quality, roughly
45 percent of boys are suspended in an academic year, which exceeds the rate for girls by over ten
percentage points. In contrast, among students who attended schools with the highest gains scores,
the male suspension rate is below ten percent, and the gender gap in suspensions narrows to just a
few percentage points.

Estimating Causal Effects of School Quality using Siblings

Since children who attend lower quality schools are disproportionately drawn from less affluent,
less educated households, and non-married (often single-headed) households, we do not view the
favorable relationship between school quality and middle-school outcomes as causal. Our primary
interest instead is in the school quality gradient in the gender gap in schooling outcomes. Does
this gradient reflect the fact that boys who attend lower-quality schools are already academically or
behaviorally disadvantaged relative to girls with similar socio-economic backgrounds (Autor et al.,
2015)? Alternatively, are outcomes of disadvantaged boys differentially sensitive to the academic
and disciplinary environment of elementary and middle schools?
To isolate the causal effect of school quality on the gender gap in academic and behavioral
outcomes from the numerous confounds visible in Table 1, we exploit cross-gender, within-family
sibling comparisons. By contrasting the outcomes of brothers and sisters who both attend schools
of lesser or superior quality, we purge the correlation between family background and schooling
outcomes to identify the interaction between school quality and student gender. We fit the following
OLS model,
Yij

= γj + β1 Boyi + β2 (Boyi ×Qij )

(1)

+β3 Qij + F0ij ψ + X0i λ + eij ,
where Yij represents an outcome for child i born to mother j, Boyi is an indicator for whether the

We confirm this fact in our data by regressing school quality measures on main effects and gender interactions for
each of the demographic variables listed in Table 1. These interaction terms are individually and jointly insignificant.

3

child is male, and Qij represents the average percentile rank of schools attended from grade one
to the time of observation in middle school. The equation includes mother fixed effects γj , which
account for time-invariant mother-specific factors that are constant across sibling births. The vector
Fij contains measures of at-birth maternal and family environment characteristics that may vary
across births, including mother’s education, marital status, age, and income tercile of neighborhood
of residence. The vector Xi controls for time-invariant child-specific attributes, including birth order
and month and year of birth. Because school quality is highly correlated with family background
factors, we also interact Boyi with maternal race/ethnicity, neighborhood income at time of birth,
maternal education levels, and family structure, to account for the differential gender gaps in gradelevel outcomes exhibited by these demographic groups, as documented in Autor et al. (2015). To
account for grade level effects, we also include indicators for grades 7 and 8 and their interactions
with gender. Standard errors are clustered at the level of mothers to account for within-child and
within-family serial correlation in these outcomes.4
In order for β2 to be an unbiased estimate of the effect of school quality on the gender gap in
educational outcomes, it must be the case that the gender gap in potential middle-school outcomes
is uncorrelated with the quality of schools attended, conditional on family background and its interaction with sex. This assumption could be violated if, for example, families that invest more in
their children prefer to send their sons (or daughters) to higher-performing schools relative to their
daughters (or sons). As noted above, we drop families in which children of elementary (middle)
school age attend different elementary (middle) schools in the same academic year. We further
probe the possibility that within-family variation in school quality is correlated with child gender
through a direct test. In results not tabulated in the paper, we estimate a specification in which
child gender is the dependent variable and the full set of controls, including mother fixed effects, are
regressors. We find no evidence that child gender systematically varies with elementary or middle
school quality, lending support to the identifying assumption that conditional on family background,
child gender is as good as randomly assigned to school quality.
The first column of Table 2 reports estimates of equation 1, but excluding mother fixed effects
γj , for the relationship between school quality and outcomes in middle school. In all three cases, we
observe that boys have substantially worse outcomes than girls in the lowest performing schools, but
that a sizable fraction of the gap is eliminated as measured school quality increases. For instance, in
Panel A (average test scores), the coefficient of −0.15 on Boyi implies that boys who attended the
lowest quality schools perform on average one-seventh of a standard deviation below their female
counterparts in reading and math.
Conversely, the coefficient on the interaction of Boyi and school quality percentile is highly
positive and statistically significant, indicating that attending a higher quality school causes the
female-favorable gender gap in academic achievement to substantially narrow. Moving from the
lowest to 50th percentile in middle school quality reduces the gender gap by 0.06 standard deviations,
almost half of the initial gender gap. For both suspensions (Panel B) and absences (Panel C), a

We restrict the sample to families in which all siblings have at least one valid observation of an academic or
behavioral outcome during grades six through eight.

50 percentile increment to school quality is estimated to close one-quarter of the boy-girl gap in
adverse behaviors observed at the lowest quality schools. In the case of suspensions, this magnitude
is economically quite large, corresponding to a five percentage point reduction in the probability of
suspension in each academic year.
In the second column, we include mother fixed effects, which is our preferred specification. We
observe that the boy disadvantage at the worst-quality schools shrinks when we compare brothers
to their sisters, but still remains very pronounced, as does the interaction between Boyi and school
quality. It is noteworthy that the main effect of school quality, β3 , falls in magnitude dramatically
when we compare brothers to sisters, rather than comparing unrelated boys and girls. As our
discussion above anticipates, this pattern confirms that unobserved family attributes affecting school
outcomes are correlated with school quality.
We further refine our analysis by exploiting family moves as a means of introducing plausibly
exogenous variation in exposure to schools of differing quality within families, following the approach
used by Chetty and Hendren (2015) to estimate the causal effects of neighborhood quality. Variation
in school quality across siblings will arise from differing exposure to schools due to the move, with the
identifying assumption that the timing of family moves are not correlated with children’s potential
outcomes.
We implement this empirical strategy by estimating Equation 1 for the restricted sample of
families who move at least five miles.5 While this identification strategy is especially valuable in
estimating the main effect of school quality, β3 , it could also be helpful in eliminating any biases
associated with the possibility that some siblings attend different elementary or middle schools
within the same district (though never simultaneously per our sample restrictions), thereby biasing
estimates of β2 in equation 1.
The results of this analysis are presented in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2. Despite the 80
percent reduction in sample size and accompanying fall in precision, the movers models generally
corroborate the primary findings. Point estimates for the impact of school quality on the gender gap
in standardized test scores and suspensions are in all cases in the same ballpark as the estimates based
on concordant school siblings, but we lack precision in the case of suspensions and no interaction
remains with regard to absences in the maternal fixed effects model. These results broadly support
the hypothesis that boys differentially benefit from higher quality primary and middle schools.
Notably, the estimated main effects of school quality on academic and behavioral outcomes using
the movers models are also reasonably comparable to those from the concordant school estimates
(those that used fixed effects), though they are also quite imprecise in two of three cases.
5
Note that we do not observe physical moves, but rather observe school moves; we assume that when at least two
siblings in a family move to a school that is a substantial distance away or in a different county, this likely reflects a
family move.

Discussion

We bring to bear new evidence using matched population-level birth and school administrative
records to explore the degree to which school quality affects the gender gap in educational and
behavioral outcomes. Cross-sectionally, we document a steep gradient between school quality and
academic and behavioral outcomes of both boys and girls, and a shallower but economically meaningful and robust differential gradient by gender—specifically, the female-favorable gap in these
outcomes is declining in school quality. Comparing within-family, between-sibling contrasts with
conventional OLS estimates, we show that the cross-sectional relationship between school quality
and student achievement vastly overstates the causal effect of quality on both genders, but it does
not overstate the effect of school quality on the gender gap. Using sibling contrasts, and focusing
either on school-concordant siblings or family movers, we confirm that school quality is (even) more
consequential for boys than girls.

Note: Sample includes Florida siblings born between 1994 and 2002 whose public school outcomes are observed between
school years 1995/1996 and 2012/2013 (2011/2012 for suspensions and absences). Siblings who were simultaneously
of elementary (middle) school age but did not attend the same elementary (middle) school are excluded. N for
math+reading scores, suspensions, and absences is 244,844, 176,434 and 175,686, respectively. Parentheses contain
standard deviations (panel A) or standard errors (panel B). Each quartile of school quality contains roughly one
quarter of all observations. School quality is measured as the mean percentile of the school level gain score for each
school attended between grade one and the last grade observed for each student. Math+reading is the average of
the standardized FCAT scores for each child and testing year (only mathematics or reading is used if the other is
missing). Panel B reports mean boy minus girl differences for outcomes during grades 6 through 8 (with later born
cohorts contributing fewer observations per student). In Panel C, white, black, Hispanic and immigrant are mutually
exclusive racial/ethnic categories. Income, maternal education and marital status are measured at the time of birth,
with income defined as the median for the mother’s current zip code at the time of delivery (sourced from the Census
2000 Survey Tabulation File).
