Intermediary Asset Pricing: New Evidence from Many Asset Classes

NBER Working Paper No. 21920

ABSTRACT
We find that shocks to the equity capital ratio of financial intermediaries—Primary Dealer counterparties
of the New York Federal Reserve—possess significant explanatory power for crosssectional variation
in expected returns. This is true not only for commonly studied equity and government bond market
portfolios, but also for other more sophisticated asset classes such as corporate and sovereign bonds,
derivatives, commodities, and currencies. Our intermediary capital risk factor is strongly pro-cyclical,
implying counter-cyclical intermediary leverage. The price of risk for intermediary capital shocks is
consistently positive and of similar magnitude when estimated separately for individual asset classes,
suggesting that financial intermediaries are marginal investors in many markets and hence key to
understanding asset prices.

Introduction

Intermediary asset pricing theories offer a new perspective for understanding risk premia. These
theories are predicated on the fact that financial intermediaries are in the advantageous position of
trading almost all asset classes, anytime and everywhere. For instance, Siriwardane (2015) shows
that in 2011 about 50% of total net Credit Derivative Swaps (CDS) protection in U.S. was sold
by the top five dealers.1 In the corporate bond market, more than 95% of bonds are traded in
over-the-counter markets, in which dealers are necessarily involved.2 It is likely that intermediaries
are marginal investors in many asset markets, and that their marginal value of wealth is a plausible
pricing kernel for a broad cross-section of securities.
This view stands in contrast to standard consumption-based models in which the focal pricing
kernel is that of the household (e.g., Campbell and Cochrane (1999); Bansal and Yaron (2004)).
Households’ comparative lack of expertise in trading assets, especially sophisticated ones like derivatives or commodities, casts doubt on the viability of household marginal utility as a unified model
for jointly pricing the wide array of traded assets in the economy.3 Our hypothesis, inspired by
intermediary asset pricing theory, is that the classic risk-return asset pricing trade-off is more
likely to hold once we replace the first-order condition of unsophisticated households with that of
sophisticated intermediaries.
The central challenges facing this hypothesis are (i) how to identify a set of financial intermediaries that are marginal investors in many markets, and (ii) how to measure their marginal utility
of wealth in order to construct the pricing kernel. For the first choice, we focus on primary dealers
who serve as counterparties of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“NY Fed” henceforth) in
its implementation of monetary policy. Primary dealers are large and sophisticated financial institutions that operate in virtually the entire universe of capital markets, and include the likes of
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Deutsche Bank.4
Our second choice is guided by the recent intermediary asset pricing models of He and Kr1

The set of all dealers are responsible for 80% of the net CDS sales in 2011. On the buy side, all dealers comprise
55% of net CDS purchases, and the top five dealers account for 25% of CDS purchases.
2
These trades are reported in the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) database. According to
Edwards et al. (2007), fewer than 5% of bonds are listed on the NYSE, and trades occuring via NYSE’s Automated
Bond System (ABS) are almost all from small retail investors. In contrast, only 2% of corporate bonds trades in
TRACE are from retail investors.

Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) and Calvet et al. (2007) document limited stock market participation by households.

ishnamurthy (2012, 2013) and Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014). In these models, which follow
the tradition of Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Holmstrom and Tirole (1997), the intermediary
sector’s net worth (or, equivalently, its equity capital ratio) is the key determinant of its marginal
value of wealth. When the intermediary experiences a negative shock to its equity capital, say due
to an unexpected drop in the securitized mortgage market, its risk bearing capacity is impaired
and its utility from an extra dollar of equity capital rises.
Prompted by these theories, in Section 2 we propose a model for the intermediary pricing
kernel that is composed of two-factors: the excess return on aggregate wealth, and the shock to
intermediaries’ (equity) capital ratio. The return on aggregate wealth captures the usual TFP-style
persistent technology shock that drives general economic growth. Innovations to the intermediary
capital ratio capture financial shocks that affect the soundness of the financial intermediary sector,
arising for example from shocks to agency/contracting frictions, changes in regulation, or large
abnormal gains/losses in parts of an intermediary’s portfolio. We show how this pricing kernel
arises in the theoretical framework of He and Krishnamurthy (2012).
We construct the aggregate capital ratio for the intermediary sector by matching the New York
Fed’s primary dealer list with CRSP/Compustat and Datastream data on their publicly traded
holding companies (see Section 3). We define the intermediary capital ratio, denoted ηt , as the
aggregate value of market equity divided by aggregate market equity plus aggregate book debt of
primary dealers active in quarter t

.
ηt = P 
i Market Equityi,t + Book Debti,t

Our main empirical result is that assets’ exposure to intermediary capital ratio shocks (innovations in ηt ) possess a strong and consistent ability to explain cross-sectional differences in
average returns for assets in seven different markets, including equities, US government and corporate bonds, foreign sovereign bonds, options, credit default swaps (CDS), commodities, and foreign
exchange (FX).
We perform cross-sectional asset pricing tests both independently within each asset class, as
well as jointly using all asset classes. By comparing the risk price on intermediary capital shocks
estimated from different sets of test assets, we can evaluate the model assumptions that (i) inter2

mediaries are marginal pricers in many markets and (ii) their equity capital ratio is a sensible proxy
for their marginal value of wealth. In particular, if we find large disparities in intermediary capital
risk prices across markets, it suggests that (i) and/or (ii) are violated.
To the contrary, we estimate significantly positive prices of risk on the intermediary capital
factor in all asset classes, and find that all estimates have similar magnitudes, consistent with the
view that primary dealers are marginal investors in all of these markets. Furthermore, we show
in placebo tests that equity capital ratios of other sectors do not exhibit this property. When we
replace primary dealers by non-primary dealers (who tend to be smaller, standalone broker-dealers
with little activity in derivatives markets) or non-financial firms, we find large discrepancies in risk
prices estimated from different asset classes that are largely insignificant and often have conflicting
signs.
Our estimates for the price of risk on intermediary capital shocks carry two important economic
implications. First, positivity of the estimated risk price means that assets that pay more in states
of the world with low intermediary capital ratio (that is, assets with low betas on ηt shocks)
also have lower expected returns in equilibrium. This implies that low capital-risk-beta assets are
viewed as valuable hedges by marginal investors or, in other words, that primary dealers have
high marginal value of wealth when their capital ratio is low. This conclusion accords with ample
empirical evidence that institutional investors become distressed and place higher marginal value
on a dollar when their capital is impaired.5 Our risk price estimates also suggest that intermediary
(primary dealer) equity capital ratios are pro-cyclical, or equivalently, that intermediary leverage
is counter-cyclical.
The second economic implication arises from the similarity in magnitudes of capital ratio risk
prices estimated from different asset classes. Our pricing kernel is a single aggregate capital ratio
(as opposed to heterogeneous ratios among intermediaries), and is based on the assumption that one
set of intermediaries is marginal in all classes.6 This assumption also predicts that the estimated
5
Examples include Froot and O’Connell (1999), Gabaix et al. (2007), Mitchell et al. (2007), Mitchell and Pulvino
(2009), and Siriwardane (2015), among others.
6
Our tests are also potentially informative about the assumption of homogeneity among intermediaries, which
is implicit in essentially all intermediary asset pricing models. If intermediaries with heterogeneous pricing kernels
specialize in specific asset classes, the risk prices identified in different markets may differ. We view this as a plausible
explanation for the small discrepancy of risk prices that we estimate from different markets, but our empirical
approach is not designed to test this hypothesis. Our tests cannot differentiate between the same intermediaries
being marginal in all asset classes, versus different intermediaries marginal in each asset class but all having highly
correlated capital ratios.

3

price of capital ratio risk should be the same in all asset classes. Our cross-asset empirical results
are not far from this theoretical prediction. The risk price estimated jointly from all asset classes
is 9% per quarter. When we instead estimate the risk price independently from each asset class,
we find that five of the seven estimates are between 7% and 11%. For options and FX portfolios,
the estimated risk prices are 22% and 19%, respectively. While we reject the null of 0% in all
seven markets,7 we cannot reject the null of 9% in any individual market. This fact is surprising
and quite striking. One might expect that trading in different asset classes involves substantially
different knowledge, expertise, and terminology; and yet all of these markets produce estimated
prices of intermediary capital risk that are statistically indistinguishable.
An important precursor to our paper is Adrian et al. (2014a) (henceforth AEM), which is the
first paper to unite the intermediary-based paradigm with mainstream empirical asset pricing.
Our identification of a positive price for exposure to primary dealer capital ratio shocks contrasts
with AEM, who estimate a positive price for broker-dealer leverage shocks. These two results are
contradictory because leverage, defined as assets over equity, is just the reciprocal of the equity
capital ratio. That is, AEM find pro-cyclical broker-dealer leverage while our paper suggests that
the leverage of primary dealers is counter-cyclical.
One key piece of evidence supports our choice of proxy for the intermediary pricing kernel
compared to AEM. The results of AEM are based on test portfolios comprised of stocks and
government bonds. We confirm their main findings that the AEM leverage factor is especially
powerful for describing the cross section of stock and bond returns. But when we perform our test
pooling all seven asset classes and replace our variable with the AEM factor, the implied price of
AEM leverage risk becomes insignificant. When estimated independently by asset class, the AEM
risk price changes sign for options, CDS, and FX markets, and for CDS the opposite-sign estimate
is statistically significant.
In Section 4, we explore potential explanations for conflicting results in our analysis versus AEM.
Our papers differ in the definition of financial intermediaries and in data sources. AEM focus on
the definition of the security broker-dealer sector and associated book leverage ratios provided in
the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds. Our definition instead uses New York Fed primary dealers and
7

For foreign sovereign bonds, we find a GMM t-statistic of 1.66 on the intermediary capital factor, which is
significant at the 10% level. In all other markets, the estimate is significant at the 5% level or better.

data on their holding companies from CRSP/Compustat and Datastream to construct the market
equity capital ratio.
We find little evidence that the accounting treatment of book versus market leverage drives
these differences.8 Rather, we argue that the discrepancy in our findings is most likely due to compositional differences in our data. Flow of Funds data only contains information about standalone
US broker-dealers and broker-dealer subsidiaries of conglomerates. Our equity capital ratio instead
relies on data at the holding company level. The distinction between these two approaches rests
on the role of internal capital markets within financial holding companies. Consider, for example,
our treatment of JP Morgan Securities LLC, which is one of the largest broker-dealers in the world
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase & Co. Flow of Funds data would only reflect
the financial health of the subsidiary. If the subsidiary suffers a large trading loss relative to the
size of the subsidiary, it will be reflected as broker-dealer financial distress in the Flow of Funds.
However, if other businesses of the JP Morgan holding company are thriving, financial distress
in the broker-dealer subsidiary may be largely mitigated thanks to its access to internal capital
markets. On the other hand, a sufficiently bad shock in one of the holding company’s non-dealer
business (for example in its large mortgage lending activities) can potentially drive the holding
company into distress. If losses are severe enough to impair internal capital flow, it will reduce
risk bearing capacity in the broker-dealer arm even though the shock originated elsewhere and the
dealer’s balance-sheet does not reflect ill health.
In short, if internal capital markets are important sources of funds for broker-dealer subsidiaries,
then financial soundness of the holding company may be a superior proxy for the intermediary sector
pricing kernel. While it is generally difficult to measure capital flows within financial conglomerates,
we provide anecdotal evidence from the bankruptcies of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990 and
Lehman Brothers in 2008. In these two cases, postmortem analysis by bank regulators revealed
large capital transfers between broker-dealer holding companies, in support of the idea that holding
company leverage is the economically important one.
Section 5 provides additional results and a battery of robustness tests. In single factor models
without the market factor, our intermediary capital ratio continues to demonstrate large explana8

We discuss this possibility in Section 4. Because book assets of broker-dealers are marked-to-market, the wedge
between their book and market values is quite small. We reinforce this view empirically by showing that book leverage
and market leverage in our primary dealer sample have a strong positive correlation.

tory power for differences in average returns within sophisticated asset classes. We show that our
results are qualitatively similar in the pre-crisis sample period 1970Q1-2006Q4, in the more recent
1990Q1-2012Q4 sample period, and when we conduct our tests at the monthly rather than quarterly frequency. Lastly, we report time series evidence that the intermediary capital ratio predicts
future returns in five of the seven asset classes we study.

Related Literature
Until recently, the role of financial institutions in determining equilibrium asset prices has been
under-appreciated by the finance literature (early contributions include Shleifer and Vishny, 1992,
1997; Allen, 2001). Our paper belongs to a burgeoning literature on intermediary asset pricing,
which highlights the pricing kernel of financial intermediaries, rather than that of households, in
explaining the pricing behavior of sophisticated financial assets (He and Krishnamurthy, 2012,
2013; Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2014)). The list of theory contributions includes Allen and Gale
(1994), Basak and Cuoco (1998), Gromb and Vayanos (2002), Xiong (2001), Kyle and Xiong (2001),
Vayanos (2004), Pavlova and Rigobon (2007), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), Duffie (2010),
Adrian and Shin (2010), Garleanu and Pederson (2011), Adrian and Boyarchenko (2012), Basak
and Pavlova (2013), Gabaix and Maggiori (2015), among others. Kondor and Vayanos (2015) study
equilibrium asset pricing with multiple assets when the arbitrage capital is scarce, which is more
in line with our cross-sectional asset pricing tests.
AEM is the first paper to provide systematic empirical support for intermediary asset pricing
theory in equity and bond markets, using classic cross-sectional pricing tests. Adrian et al. (2014b)
extends the AEM evidence by demonstrating that broker-dealer leverage has significant time-series
forecasting power for returns on stocks and bonds. Haddad and Sraer (2015) argue that banks are
central in understanding interest rate risk and document that banks’ exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates forecasts excess Treasury bond returns.
Equity and bond markets see greater direct participation by households. Participation of households in less sophisticated markets in no way precludes financial intermediaries from also being
marginal, so that the intermediary kernel may also price assets in these markets as well.9 In more
9

Conceptually, if households are marginal investors in equity and bond markets and households’ pricing kernel
is accurately measured, it should also succeed in pricing the cross section of equities and bonds, regardless of the
presence of intermediaries as additional marginal traders in the market. The daunting task facing the household view

6

specialized asset classes, on the other hand, trading is dominated by intermediaries. Past work has
shown direct evidence linking the behavior of intermediary capital to asset prices. Early work by
Froot and O’Connell (1999) studies the effects of slow-moving intermediary capital in the catastrophe insurance market. Gabaix et al. (2007) study the mortgage-backed securities market, and
present evidence that the marginal investor pricing these assets is a specialized intermediary rather
than a CAPM-type representative household. Bates (2003); Garleanu et al. (2009) present similar
evidence for index options. Mitchell et al. (2007) provide a range of pricing distortions in certain
asset markets—including convertible bond arbitrage and merger arbitrage—when arbitrageurs that
specialize in these assets suffer significant losses in capital. Mitchell and Pulvino (2009) offer further
evidence on the divergent behavior of the bond-CDS basis during the 2008 financial crisis. Siriwardane (2015) demonstrates the effect of intermediary capital losses on CDS spreads. In exchange
rate literature, Adrian et al. (2009), Adrian et al. (2011), and Hong and Yogo (2012) show that
financier’s positions are useful in predicting expected currency returns, a fact that is consistent
with the broad view proposed by our paper. Perhaps the most important contribution of our paper
is to formally and simultaneously test the intermediary model in a wide range of asset classes where
we expect intermediaries to matter most and households to matter least.

Intermediary capital risk in a two-factor asset pricing model

We propose a two-factor model in which the intermediary’s equity capital ratio enters the pricing
kernel alongside aggregate wealth. Section 2.1 provides an argument for why this specification
captures the intermediary’s marginal value of wealth and thus why it prices all asset classes in which
the intermediary participates as a marginal investor. There are various economic mechanisms for
why and how the intermediary’s capital ratio affects its marginal value of wealth, and Section 2.2
lays out one such theory based on He and Krishnamurthy (2012).

2.1

Intermediary capital ratio and pricing kernel

Traditional consumption-based asset pricing models (Campbell and Cochrane, 1999; Bansal and
Yaron, 2004) are cast in a complete market where the marginal investor is a consumer household.
is constructing a pricing kernel from relatively poor quality household data.

7

These models implicitly view intermediation as a pure pass through, and asset markets are studied
as direct interactions among households. By contrast, intermediary asset pricing models emphasize
the unique role that sophisticated intermediaries play in many risky financial assets. These models
short circuit the aggregation arguments that lead to representative household models by limiting
the participation of households in certain markets and introducing frictions in the ability of “specialist/expert” intermediaries to raise financing from the household sector. As a result, households
are not marginal in at least some markets, and household marginal utility of consumption fails to
price assets in those markets. For these same markets, intermediaries take over the role of marginal
trader, raising the possibility that their marginal value of wealth is better suited as an empirical
pricing kernel.
We propose the following intermediary pricing kernel, in which the equity capital ratio of the
intermediary sector determines its marginal value of wealth. We define the intermediary’s (equity)
capital ratio as the equity fraction of total assets in the aggregate balance sheet of the intermediary
sector:
ηt ≡

Equityt
.
Assett

(1)

Denote aggregate wealth in the economy by Wt . We define the intermediary’s marginal value of
wealth at time t as
Λt ∝ e−ρt · (ηt Wt )−γ ,

(2)

where ρ > 0 and γ > 0 are positive constants, which we later show correspond to the intermediary’s
time-discount rate and relative risk-aversion, respectively.
The empirical study in this paper relies on the qualitative implications of (2), but not on the
specific functional form. The exact functional form in (2), which arises from existing theories
under appropriate assumptions, is intuitive. First, the aggregate wealth term Wt captures the asset
pricing role of persistent productivity shocks that affect the overall fundamentals of the economy. It
is the standard economic growth term consumption-based theories and has the same interpretation
here—all else equal, Wt is negatively related to the economic agent’s marginal value of wealth.
The second and more novel aspect of intermediary asset pricing models is the role of ηt . Specification (2) implies that the intermediary’s marginal value of wealth rises when the intermediary’s
capital ratio ηt falls. It captures the intuition that an intermediary’s risk bearing capacity is in8

hibited when its equity capital is low. Risk aversion drives up the intermediary’s marginal value
of wealth in low equity states. This theoretical mechanism operates in the micro foundation of
Section 2.2 as long as a significant portion of the compensation received by managers/traders is
stock-based. Importantly, there are other potential mechanisms that lead intermediaries to value
a dollar more when their (equity) capital is impaired. For institutions that face regulatory capital
requirements, risk-tolerance shrinks as losses eat into their capital base, leading them to potentially
forgo otherwise profitable investment opportunities. An extra dollar of capital is especially valuable
to the institution in these states.10
To summarize, the marginal value of wealth specification in (2) has a two-factor structure
that embeds the broad economic growth shocks of traditional models via Wt , along with shocks
that govern soundness of the financial intermediary sector via ηt . This second factor captures
agency/contracting frictions in the intermediation business, regulator considerations, or shocks to
non-dealer portions of the intermediary’s portfolio (e.g., the mortgage market collapse in 2007-09)
that affect the intermediary’s broader risk bearing capacity.11 This two-factor view is consistent
with Muir (2014) who shows that the asset pricing behavior is markedly different during “fundamental” disaster episodes (such as wars) and “financial disasters” (such as banking panics).
Given (2), we use the asset pricing Euler equation to derive the two-factor asset pricing model
that is the basis of our cross-sectional tests. For any asset i with instantaneous return dRti , the
first-order condition of the intermediary who acts as the marginal investor implies

Many of the largest primary dealers in our sample are constrained by Basel capital requirements (Kisin and
Manela, 2013), and potentially also by the SEC’s net capital rule. Capital constraints are particularly costly during
liquidity crises (Kashyap et al., 2008; Hanson et al., 2011; Koijen and Yogo, forthcoming; Kisin and Manela, 2013).
11
For example, He and Krishnamurthy (2012) (page 757, Section 4.4.5) consider a setting in which the second shock
affects the severity of agency problems when intermediaries contract with households. In equilibrium, a negative shock
to agency frictions lowers the households’ equity capital contribution, which drives the evolution of leverage and hence
the pricing kernel in (2).

Equation (3) is the two-factor pricing model that guides our cross-sectional pricing tests, and in
particular predicts that the price of both market risk and intermediary capital risk are positive.
The intuition behind the prediction is that a positive shock to either Wt or ηt drives down the
marginal value of wealth Λt ; hence, the higher an asset’s covariance with either factor, the higher
the expected equilibrium return that the asset must promise to compensate its investor, all else
equal.

2.2

An intermediary asset pricing model

We now provide a theoretical framework where the exact intermediary pricing kernel in (2) arises
in general equilibrium. Consider a two-agent economy populated by households and financial
intermediaries. Suppose that the intermediary (or, the specialist/expert who runs the intermediary
in the language of He and Krishnamurthy (2013); Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014)) has power
utility over its consumption stream

with ρ being the discount rate and γ being the constant relative risk aversion.
Since intermediaries (rather than households) are always marginal investors in risky assets, their

10

marginal utility of wealth, which equals the marginal utility of consumption, prices all assets in
equilibrium.12 To a first-order approximation, the intermediary’s consumption ct is proportional
to its wealth WtI . That is, ct = βWtI , where β is a positive constant. For log utility this simple
consumption rule is exact with β = ρ. Hence the intermediary’s discounted marginal utility of
consumption is

Λt = e−ρt u0 βWtI = e−ρt βWtI

−γ

.

(4)

It is the intermediary’s wealth WtI (or the bankers’ net worth, in connection to the macro finance
literature) that enters directly into the pricing kernel.
Let aggregate wealth, Wt , include the wealth of both the household and intermediary sectors,
and define ηt as the intermediary sector’s share of aggregate wealth in the economy:
WtI = ηt Wt .

(5)

That is, the intermediary’s wealth share is directly linked to the its level of capital, and captures
the soundness of the intermediary sector in this economy.
This brings us back to our definition of the intermediary capital ratio in Section 2.1, ηt =
Equityt
Assetst . Under stylized assumptions, the intermediary’s capital ratio exactly coincides with its
wealth share. For instance, He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013) assume that risky assets are held
directly only by the intermediary sector.13 Then, in general equilibrium, equity measures the
intermediary’s net worth and assets on the intermediary balance sheet measure aggregate wealth,
thus the capital ratio indeed measures the wealth share of the intermediary sector.14 Therefore,
plugging (5) into (4) arrives at the pricing kernel in Equation (2).
We emphasize, though, that our reduced form cross-sectional asset pricing tests only rely on
qualitative properties of the pricing kernel, and hence this stringent assumption about asset holdings
can be easily relaxed. For the pricing kernel specification (2) to price assets, we require that the
12

We need not to specify the utility function of households as the intermediary’s optimality condition yields the
pricing relations that we take to data.
13
Although the assumption in He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013) appears rather stark, it is consistent with
He et al. (2010) who document that mortgage-related toxic assets are always on the balance sheet of financial
intermediaries (mainly commercial banks) at the height of the crisis, 2008Q4 to 2009Q1.
14
In He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013), households can also access risky assets indirectly through the intermediary
sector with certain agency frictions, which could bind (the “constrained” region) or not (the “unconstrained” region).
This mapping between ηt and the capital ratio is exact in the constrained region.

11

intermediary’s capital ratio is positively correlated with its wealth share ηt . This key property
holds in Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), which allows households to manage risky assets at
some exogenous holding cost.15

Cross-Sectional Analysis

We present our main empirical results in this section. After explaining the data construction, we
perform formal cross-sectional asset pricing tests for a variety of asset classes.

3.1
3.1.1

Data
Primary dealers’ market equity capital ratio

Our definition of the intermediary sector is the set of primary dealers. These form a select group
of financial intermediaries that serve as trading counterparties to the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York in its implementation of monetary policy. We obtain the historical list of primary dealers from
the NY Fed’s website, and hand-match dealers to data on their publicly-traded holding companies
from either CRSP/Compustat (for US dealers) or Datastream (for foreign dealers). We list current
primary dealer designees in Table 1 and provide the full historical list in Table A.1.16
The primary dealer sector is a natural candidate for the representative financial intermediary.
These institutions are large and active intermediaries who are likely to be marginal in almost all
financial markets. Table 2 shows that this relatively small group of firms represents essentially all of
the broker-dealer sector by size, a substantial share of the broader banking sector, and is even large
relative to the entire publicly traded sector.17 Below, we use “primary dealer” and “intermediary”
interchangeably whenever there is no ambiguity in the context.

In Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), a series of negative shocks impairs the capital of intermediaries leading
them to reduce their borrowing and shed assets and by selling them to households. Nevertheless, debt reduction lags
behind the pace of equity impairment, and the endogenous capital ratio of the intermediary sector falls following
negative shocks. As a result, the intermediaries’ wealth share ηt moves together with their capital ratio.
16
Cheng et al. (2015) also focus on primary dealers in their study of executive compensation in financial firms.
17
For comparison, we focus on US-only firms in Table 2, and define the total broker-dealer sector as the set of US
primary dealers plus any firms with a broker-dealer SIC code (6211 or 6221). Note that had we instead relied on the
SIC code definition of broker-dealers, we would miss important dealers that are subsidiaries of holding companies
that not classified as broker-dealers, for instance JP Morgan.

where firm i is a NY Fed primary dealer designee during quarter t. We use book value of debt to
proxy for the unobserved market value of debt, as customary in corporate finance. Our data inputs
for the capital ratio come from the quarterly CRSP/Compustat file for US firms. Book value of
debt is equal to total assets less common equity, using the most recent data available for each firm
at the end of a calendar quarter. The market value of equity is share price times shares outstanding
on the last trading day of the quarter. We follow the same calculation with Datastream data for
public holding companies of foreign primary dealers.
We plot the intermediary capital ratio, which runs from 1970 to 2012, in Figure 1 (with shaded
areas indicating NBER recessions). Intermediary capital falls during recessions and reaches its
nadir in the 2008 financial crisis. The capital ratio also exhibits a sudden drop and rebound around
the 1998 LTCM collapse, representing shocks that only affect certain asset markets (e.g., options)
but not the entire stock market.
We construct the capital ratio growth rate, denotes ηt∆ , as follows. We estimate a shock to the
capital ratio in levels, ut , as an innovation in the auto-regression η t = ρ0 + ρη t−1 + ut ,18 and convert
this to a growth rate by dividing by the lagged capital ratio

ηt∆ = ut /ηt−1 .

This serves as the risk factor that is the key input into our cross section tests.
Figure 1 plots ηt and ηt∆ , and Table 3 shows their correlations with an array of aggregate
macro variables. Specifically, we compare to the S&P 500 earnings-to-price ratio from Shiller,
the unemployment rate, GDP growth, the Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index (for
which a high level corresponds to weak financial conditions), and realized volatility of the CRSP
value-weighted stock index. Correlations with ηt∆ are based on log changes in each macro variable.
All correlations reflect pro-cyclicality of the capital ratio (or counter-cyclicality of leverage) in that

low intermediary capital growth coincides with adverse economic shocks, measured as increases
in the earnings-to-price ratio, increases in high unemployment rate, decreases in GDP growth, a
deterioration in financial conditions (based on the Chicago Fed index), or increases in realized
volatility.

3.1.2

Asset portfolios

A key feature distinguishing our paper from existing literature is our use of test portfolios that
span a wide range of asset classes. To avoid potential arbitrariness in our choice of test portfolios,
especially for asset classes that are less standard than the Fama-French equity data, we rely on
readily available asset portfolios provided by authors of pre-existing studies wherever possible.
For equities, we use the Fama and French (1993) 25 size and value sorted portfolios (from Ken
French’s website). For US bond portfolios, we include government and corporate bond portfolios
in the same class.19 We use ten maturity-sorted government bonds portfolios from CRSP’s “Fama
Bond Portfolios” file with maturities in six month intervals up to five years. For corporate bonds,
we use ten portfolios sorted on yield spreads from Nozawa (2014). These portfolios are based on a
comprehensive bond data set combining TRACE, the Lehman bond database, and others, starting
in 1973.
For sovereign bonds we use six portfolios from Borri and Verdelhan (2012). These portfolios are
based on a two-way sort on a bond’s covariance with the US equity market return and the bond’s
Standard & Poor’s credit rating. Monthly portfolio returns begin in January 1995 and end in April
2011.
For options, we use 54 portfolios of S&P 500 index options sorted on moneyness and maturity
from Constantinides et al. (2013), split by contract type (27 call and 27 put portfolios), and starting
in 1986. Portfolio returns are leverage-adjusted, meaning that each option portfolio is combined
with the risk free rate to achieve a targeted market beta of one. According to Constantinides et al.
(2013), “The major advantage of this construction is to lower the variance and skewness of the
monthly portfolio returns and render the returns close to normal (about as close to normal as the
index return), thereby making applicable the standard linear factor pricing methodology.” To keep
19

Our choice to combine US government and corporate bonds into a single asset class is driven by our desire to
estimate prices of intermediary capital risk separately for each asset class. Treating US government bonds as its own
asset class is not statistically sensible due to the very high correlation in the returns on these portfolios.

14

the number of portfolios used in our tests similar across asset classes, we reduce the 54 portfolios to
18 portfolios by constructing equal-weighted averages of portfolios that have the same moneyness
but different maturity (though our results are essentially unchanged if we use all 54 portfolios
separately).
For foreign exchange, we combine two datasets of currency portfolios to arrive at a total of
twelve portfolios. First is the set of six currency portfolios sorted on the interest rate differential
from Lettau et al. (2014). Second is the set of six currency portfolios sorted on momentum from
Menkhoff et al. (2012). We use the sample period intersection of these datasets, covering March
1976 to January 2010.20
For commodities, we include 24 commodity futures returns studied in Koijen et al. (2013). The
commodities series include six energy products, eight agricultural crops, three livestock, and seven
metals. We use the sample during which all futures returns are non-missing (beginning in 2002).
CDS is the only asset class for which we do not have portfolio returns from preexisting studies.
To fill this gap, we construct 20 portfolios sorted by spreads using individual name 5-year CDS.
The data are from Markit and begin in 2001. We focus on 5-year CDS contracts for the well known
reason that these are the most liquid contracts. Our definition of CDS returns follows Palhares
(2013). In particular, let CDSt be the credit spread at day t. The one-day return on a short CDS
strategy (in the case of no default) is

CDStret =

CDSt−1
+ 4CDSt × RDt−1 .
250

The first term on the right-hand-side is the carry component of the return due to the seller’s receipt
of insurance premium payments. The second term is the capital gain return, equal to the change
in spread times the lagged risky duration of the contract (denoted RDt−1 ). The risky duration
capitalizes the future per-period CDS spread that a seller receives into a present value, which when
20
We use combined data because the underlying data sources for the two sets of portfolios differ somewhat and
the portfolio correlations are relatively low. Multiple regression of each Lettau et al. portfolio on to all six Menkhoff
et al. portfolios yields R2 s of 0.53, 0.74, 0.82, 0.81, 0.75, and 0.56. Since these portfolios are far from collinear, our
tests benefit from improved power by doubling the number of portfolios. However, the qualitative results of our tests
are identical if we restrict our currency analysis to only one of the two data sets.

15

multiplied by the change in spread approximates the log capital gain of the short position.21
We also consider tests in which all portfolios are gathered into a single large cross-section.
Because some asset classes (such as CDS and commodities) are only available toward the end of
our sample, the tests of all portfolios use an unbalanced panel of portfolio returns.
Table 4 provides summary statistics by asset class. For each class, we report the average
portfolio excess return and time series beta with respect to each risk factor. Importantly for our
tests, we observe considerable risk dispersion within and across asset classes. For example, the
Fama-French portfolios have an average time-series intermediary capital beta (βη ) of 0.07, with a
standard deviation of 0.11 across the 25 portfolios. The last two columns show in the pool of all
asset classes, the dispersion in βη is even higher, with a mean of 0.01 and standard deviation of
0.17.

3.2

Cross-sectional asset pricing tests

We turn next to formal cross-sectional asset pricing tests. These assess whether differential exposure
to intermediary capital shocks across assets can explain the variation in their expected returns. We
investigate each asset class separately, and also conduct joint tests using the full universe of asset
classes together.

3.2.1

Estimated price of intermediary capital risk across asset classes

Our investigation of these seven asset classes begins with cross-sectional asset pricing tests in each
class separately. For each portfolio i in asset class k, we estimate betas from time-series regressions

of portfolio excess returns, Rt+1
− rtf , on the intermediary capital risk factor, ηt+1

where e−jλ/4 is the quarterly survival probability, rt is the risk-free rate for the quarter j/4, and e−j(rt )/4 is
the quarterly discount function. In the empirical implementation we assume that the term structure of survival
probabilities is flat and extract λ each day from the 5-year spread as λ = 4 log(1 + CDS/4L), where CDS is the
spread and L is the loss given default (assumed to be 60%). The risk-free term structure is constructed using swap
rates for maturities 3 and 6 months and US Treasury yields for maturities from 1 year to 10 years (data from
Gürkaynak et al., 2007). Risk-free rates are interpolated with a cubic function to find rates for each quarter.

Our main focus is on the price of the intermediary capital risk, λkη . Table 5 reports estimates for
the 1970Q1–2012Q4 period. The first seven columns include results from independent estimation
within each asset class. Below estimated risk prices we report Fama-MacBeth (1973) t-statistics (tFM) that correct for return cross-correlation as well as GMM t-statistics (t-GMM) that correct for
cross-correlation and first-stage estimation error in betas (as advocated by Cochrane (2005)). The
measures of model fit that we report are the cross-sectional R2 for average portfolio returns, and
the related mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) in percentage terms (that is, the mean absolute
residual in the cross-sectional regression multiplied by 100).
Intermediary capital risk price estimates are positive in all asset classes, supporting the main
empirical prediction of our proposed pricing kernel. Risk price estimates range from 7% for equities
to 22% for options, and are statistically significant in all but one asset class at the 5% level, and
in all classes at the 10% (the GMM t-statistic based on six sovereign bond portfolios is 1.66). The
model provides the closest fit for option portfolios (R2 of 99%) and the weakest fit for commodities
(R2 of 44%).
The last column of Table 5 reports results when all 125 portfolios from seven asset classes are
included simultaneously in the cross-sectional test. The estimated price of intermediary capital
22
Notice that the model (3) is in the conditional form. Our empirical implementation uses an unconditional
test. If test asset betas are constant over time, then the risk prices that we estimate are simply unconditional
expectations of potentially state-dependent risk prices. If, however, the true betas are time-varying, then in general
(7) and (8) are misspecified. The divergence between model and empirics is due to data limitations and for the
sake of transparency. The conditional test requires an estimate of conditional betas, which is challenging due to the
intermediary capital factor’s reliance on quarterly accounting information (data limitations). This may be overcome
with more sophisticated estimators and ad hoc specification of conditioning information, though we leave this for
future research (sake of transparency).
23
The cross section regressions in (8) include the constant γk . Section 5.7 reports estimation results that impose
the model restriction γk = 0, which produces nearly identical results.

17

risk is 9% per quarter with a GMM t-statistic of 2.56 and R2 of 45%. This risk price estimate
is economically large. For example, the cross-sectional standard deviation in intermediary capital
growth betas for the all portfolios case is 0.17 (see Table 4). Thus, a one standard deviation
difference in the capital risk beta of two assets corresponds to a difference of 0.17 × 0.09 × 4, or
6.12 percentage points, in their annual risk premium.24
It is interesting to note that in our main bivariate specification, the estimated price of risk on
the market portfolio is positive in all asset classes, though it is significant only in the FX test. The
significance of intermediary capital risk after controlling for the market return indicates that our
pricing kernel statistically improves on the CAPM for all sets of test assets. In Section 5.6, we
show that capital risk remains a powerful determinant of asset price behavior after controlling for
other standard risk factors.

3.2.2

Are prices of risk similar across asset classes?

The sign of the estimated price of risk for intermediary capital factor is consistently positive across
all asset classes in Table 5. What can we learn from the magnitudes of the estimates?
Theoretically, if (2) is indeed an appropriate pricing kernel for all asset classes, then the price
of risk from each asset class should be the same (up to sampling error). Risk prices are determined
solely by the pricing kernel of marginal investors, and therefore must be invariant with respect to
the attributes of the assets it is pricing. This is trivially evident from the Euler equation, which
implies a functional form for risk prices that is independent of the specific asset in question:

The quantity of risk, or beta, is an attribute of the asset and can differ substantially across classes.
Equation (9) makes the theoretical statement that any difference in risk premia across asset must
come solely from differences in betas, holding risk prices fixed. If λ is for some reason higher in a
particular asset class, then the intermediary can earn a higher expected return (without increasing
its risk) by shifting its portfolio toward this class. In turn, prices of risk would equalize, reinforcing

Figure 3 plots average portfolio returns in all asset classes versus predicted values from the two-factor intermediary
capital model. Appendix Table A.1 draws the same plot using separate parameter estimates within each asset class.

18

the equilibrium consistency of risk prices across all assets.
The test in the last column of Table 5, i.e., the “all portfolios” column, indeed imposes that risk
prices are equal across asset classes. Figure 2 compares intermediary risk prices from different asset
classes, and also compares with the “all portfolios” estimate, to illustrate the impressive similarity
in estimates across tests. Formally, our GMM test cannot reject the hypothesis that the estimated
risk price is equal to 9% per quarter (the value found in the “all portfolios” case) for any of the
individual asset classes, at the 5% significance level. This is not merely a statement that our
standard errors are large and lack power—we indeed reject the null of a 0% risk price in all classes
(at the 10% significance level or better).
From a theory perspective, the prediction of equal risk prices relies on the following key assumptions. First, the proposed financial intermediary pricing kernel represents the intermediaries’
marginal value of wealth. Second, financial intermediaries are actively making trading decisions
in all asset markets. Also implicit in these assumptions is a degree of homogeneity in the pricing
kernels of individual financial intermediaries. That all financial intermediaries are homogeneous is
the most standard but perhaps the most tenuous assumption. Its failure could potentially explain
the somewhat higher options and FX point estimates, if intermediaries that specialize in trading
these instruments differ in some way from other intermediaries (see for example Gârleanu et al.,
forthcoming).

3.2.3

Are primary dealers special?

We next explore the role of our specific intermediary sector definition for the preceding results.
We conduct placebo tests that replicate our cross section analysis, but replace the capital ratio of
primary dealers with that of other “intermediary” definitions.
First, we consider defining intermediaries according to SIC codes of US broker-dealers—codes
6211 (“security brokers, dealers, and flotation companies”) and 6221 (commodity contracts brokers
and dealers)—but exclude firms that are designated NY Fed primary dealers. This definition, which
we refer to as “non-primary” dealers, includes firms like Blackrock, Charles Schwab, and Waddell
& Reed. As shown in Table 2, non-primary dealers are small relative to primary dealers.
In Panel (a) of Table 6, we report cross section tests using non-primary dealer capital ratio
as a factor. Only equities and CDS show a significantly positive price of capital ratio risk based
19

on this intermediary definition; the estimated price of capital risk in other asset classes is either
insignificant or has a negative sign.
Extending this idea further, we construct the equity capital ratio risk factor for the entire US
non-bank sector, i.e., all public firms in CRSP/Compustat with SIC codes that do not begin with
6. The results, reported in Panel (b), demonstrate the overall inability of the non-bank capital
ratio to price assets, with estimates switching sign across classes and a point estimate of nearly
zero in the “all portfolios” test. Overall, Table 6 provides additional indirect evidence supporting
our assumption that primary dealers are pricing-relevant financial intermediaries.

3.2.4

Which is more important for pricing, equity or debt?

Innovations in our measure of intermediary capital ratio are driven by either changes in market
value of equity or changes in book debt. We investigate which of these is the more important driver
of our asset pricing result.
t
, can
We first show that our intermediary capital factor, which is the shock to ln ηt = ln EtE+D
t

be decomposed into the growth rate of the primary dealer market equity, denoted by d ln Et , and
the growth rate of their debt, denoted by d ln Dt . More specifically, as we are only interested in
diffusion terms (which implies that we can ignore Ito’s correction terms which contribute to the
drift), we have25
d ln ηt = d ln

Et
= (1 − ηt ) (d ln Et − d ln Dt ) .
Et + Dt

(10)

As a result, our innovations d ln ηt equal the equity growth rate shock d ln Et minus the debt growth
rate shock d ln Dt , both scaled by 1−ηt . Guided by (10), we test a three-factor version of our model
that decomposes the capital risk factor into log innovations in primary dealer market equity and
log innovations in their book value of debt. The decomposition in (10) also implies that the equity
growth rate shock carries a positive price of risk, while price of the debt growth rate shock should
be negative.26
25

The derivation with intermediate steps is (recall ηt =
d ln ηt = d ln Et − d ln (Et + Dt ) = d ln Et −

Et
Et +Dt

and ignore drift terms with Ito corrections)

Et d ln Et + Dt d ln Dt
= (1 − ηt ) (d ln Et − d ln Dt ) .
Et + D t

26

The capital ratio decomposition gives rise to an ηt term premultiplying the difference in equity growth and debt
growth. This scales down the risk prices in this three-factor model relative to the benchmark model. But, because the
time-series average of ηt is 0.06, this effect is quantitatively small, and risk price magnitudes can still be meaningfully

20

Because the primary dealer list changes over time, we construct equity and debt growth measures
that are insensitive to entry and exit. The equity growth rate from quarter t to t + 1 is defined as
the log change in total market equity of all designated primary dealers as of time t. That is, if a
designee enters the list in t + 1, its equity is excluded from the t + 1 growth rate calculation, and if
it exits before t + 1 then its market equity is still included in the growth rate (likewise for debt).27
The results are presented in Table 7. In all asset classes, the estimated price of risk on intermediary equity shocks remains positive and economically large (at least 5% per quarter in each asset
class). For the “all portfolios” test, the price of intermediary equity risk is 9% per quarter. Overall,
the pricing ability of intermediary equity is similar, but somewhat weaker, than that of the capital
ratio variable. The estimated price on book debt innovations is negative in six out of seven asset
classes, as we expect given our theory and the negative functional relation between debt shocks
and capital ratio shocks. However, the magnitudes are often small and insignificant. For the all
portfolios test, the intermediary debt risk price is −2% per quarter and is insignificant.
In sum, these results suggest that while book debt innovations play some role in our main
pricing results, it is the market equity component of the capital ratio that is most important for
the effects that we document.

Comparison with AEM: Empirics, Sample Composition, and
Theory

4.1

Brief review of AEM

AEM is an important precursor to our paper and is the first paper to bring the intermediary-based
pricing paradigm into the conversation of “mainstream” empirical pricing models. These authors
propose a one-factor intermediary pricing kernel. The factor is the innovation in broker-dealer book
leverage derived from data in the Flow of Funds. In principle, the main intermediary leverage state
variable in their empirical model is exactly the reciprocal of our capital ratio state variable. Though
empirically, there are a number of important differences in our analyses that we discuss below.
compared to those in Table 7.
27
We use this calculation to demonstrate that our findings are not driven by changes in the primary dealer list,
though our results are unaffected if we allow entry and exit in our calculation.

21

AEM conduct standard cross section pricing tests using the 25 Fama-French equity portfolios,
10 momentum equity portfolios, and six Treasury bond portfolios. The main result is the robust
ability of broker-dealer leverage for pricing the cross section of stocks and Treasury bonds. They
estimate a large and significant positive price of risk on leverage shocks. This has the interpretation
that intermediary marginal value of wealth is higher when its leverage is lower, or equivalently
implies that a high equity capital ratio indicates intermediary financial distress.
Due to the reciprocal relationship between capital ratio and leverage, AEM’s finding is in direct
contradiction with our finding of a robust positive price of risk price on the intermediary capital ratio.
The AEM finding also contradicts the theoretical prediction of He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013)
and Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) that a low capital ratio proxies for intermediary distress
and hence a high marginal value of wealth.
The tension in the two sets of results is rather puzzling. Theoretically, we are attempting to
measure the same quantity—financial distress of the intermediary sector—with the only conceptual
difference being that their preferred measure is the inverse of our measure. Therefore, we would
expect our price of risk estimates to always have the opposite sign, with otherwise similar magnitude
and statistical significance. The facts are in stark contrast to this prediction. It stands to reason,
therefore, that our empirical measures do not behave inversely to one another as predicted. Indeed,
Figure 4a illustrates the inconsistency. Our capital ratio measure and AEM’s leverage measure are
significantly positively related in the time series, sharing a 42% correlation in levels. Figure 4b
compares innovations in the two series, which share a 14% correlation.
We devote this section to understanding the differences in our empirical facts, and to place
these differences in context of various intermediary asset pricing theories.

4.2

Empirical performance of AEM in many asset classes

First, we extend our multiple asset class tests to better understand the empirical performance of
AEM’s intermediary pricing kernel. This portion of our analysis is exactly analogous to our earlier
tests using the capital ratio. In particular, we consider a two-factor model that includes AEM
leverage innovations and the return on the market portfolio.28
28

We construct the AEM leverage factor for the 1970–2012 period as described in their paper. It is 0.99 correlated
with the one provided by Tyler Muir at faculty.som.yale.edu/tylermuir/LEVERAGEFACTORDATA_001.txt, which
ends in 2009.

22

Table 8 reports the estimated AEM leverage factor risk price and related model statistics for
each asset class. For equities and US bonds, the AEM leverage factor carries a significantly positive
price, which essentially replicates the key findings reported by AEM (with the exception that our
“US bonds” definition also includes corporates). In these two classes, the performance of the AEM
pricing kernel is superior to ours, as reflected in their higher cross-sectional R2 . AEM also emphasize
that their leverage measure successfully explains differences in average returns among momentumsorted equity portfolios. Our measure, on the other hand, does not explain the momentum anomaly
in equities.
The AEM model delivers very different results in other assets classes. The leverage risk price
either becomes strongly negative (options, CDS, and FX) or remains positive but statistically
insignificant (foreign sovereign bonds and commodities). In the “all portfolios” joint test, the
estimated price of risk is positive but statistically insignificant. Furthermore, the estimated risk
price of 13% is economically smaller. From Table 9, the standard deviation in AEM leverage betas
across all portfolios is 0.05, implying differences in annual AEM leverage premia of 0.05 × 0.13 × 4,
or 2.6 percentage points, for a one standard deviation difference in beta (or forty percent of the
risk premium effect that we find for our intermediary capital factor). Figure 5 illustrates the extent
of inconsistency in AEM pricing performance across asset classes, which contrasts with the capital
ratio model results in Figure 2.
We next consider a three-factor horse-race specification that includes our capital ratio factor and
the AEM leverage factor together (along with the market return). Table 10 reports the estimation
results for each asset class. In the equity market, the presence of AEM renders the capital ratio
insignificant, reiterating the strong pricing power of AEM for the US equity market. In all other
asset classes, the price of intermediary capital risk is at least 6% per quarter, and only loses
statistical significance in the options market. The options market is an interesting case; in the
horse-race specification, the lack of statistical significance for our measure appears due to the large
and significant negative price of risk on the AEM factor.
Our emphasis on a variety of asset classes is the key empirical feature that distinguishes our
paper from AEM. Most intermediary-based asset pricing models are founded on the limits-toarbitrage paradigm (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997), which implies that the pricing kernel of households
might not be relevant if some asset classes are too complicated for households to trade in directly.
23

Presumably, derivatives contracts or OTC markets are too sophisticated to be directly accessed by
most household investors. By contrast, financial intermediaries play a central role in the market
for derivatives and OTC assets. Our paper provides supporting evidence that this distinction is
important for understanding the behavior of a wide variety of assets.

4.3

Data source and measurement

Our measure of financial distress differs from AEM in both the definition of a financial intermediary
and the data sources employed. We define intermediaries as the set of primary dealers and rely
on market equity and book debt data for their publicly traded holding companies. AEM define
intermediaries as the set of broker-dealer firms (often bank holding company subsidiaries) that feed
into the Flow of Funds broker-dealer accounts, and use the book equity and debt data reported in
those accounts.29
The two key differences are (i) our use of market values for constructing capital ratios, versus
AEM’s reliance on accounting book values, and (ii) our use of data at the holding company level,
versus the broker-dealer subsidiary level information in the Flow of Funds. We explore the role of
these differences in this section.

4.3.1

Market leverage vs. book leverage

Our aim in constructing the capital ratio is to provide a current measure of financial distress that
reflects the information available in prevailing market prices. Virtually all intermediary asset pricing
theories would suggest using market values, which reflect forward looking information available in
traded securities prices. While the market value of equity is readily available for publicly traded
firms, market debt values are much more difficult to measure. Instead, we follow the standard
approach in empirical corporate finance and use firms’ most recently published book value of debt
from accounting statements. The inverse of our market equity capital ratio is referred to as “market
leverage.”
Book leverage, on the other hand, relies on accounting statement data for both equity and debt.
One would expect a positive correlation between market and book capital ratios due to the fact
29
Flow of Funds broker-dealer data are from SEC tabulation of regulatory filings. It includes most broker-dealer
firms that file the Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) report or the Finances and Operations of Government Securities Brokers and Dealers (FOGS) report with their regulator (e.g. FINRA).

24

that broker-dealers and banks are required to frequently mark their books to market. When markto-market is implemented perfectly, book leverage coincides with its market counterpart.30 Because
Flow of Funds data only includes book data for broker-dealers, Adrian et al. (2014a) rely on book
leverage for their analysis, and appeal to mark-to-market accounting to support the timeliness and
accuracy of their measure.31
An advantage of our data set is that we have access to both book and market equity values. We
construct both book and market capital ratios for our sample of primary dealers, where the book
capital ratio is defined similarly as in (6), but replacing the market equity with its corresponding
book equity. We then investigate whether drastic differences in the two measures can potentially
reconcile differences in our findings with AEM. For example, a negative correlation between book
and market leverage in our sample could help explain the conflicting risk prices estimated in our
study and that of AEM.32
We find, however, that the market capital ratio of primary dealers is in fact strongly positively
associated with book capital ratio. Book and market capital ratios have a correlation of 50% in
levels and 30% in innovations, indicating qualitatively similar behavior between them. This is
illustrated in the time series plot of Figure 4b, and suggests that Compustat book leverage of
primary dealers is in fact counter-cyclical. We present more direct evidence in appendix Table
A.2, where we estimate the two-factor asset pricing model which replaces the market capital ratio
factor with its corresponding book capital ratio. The estimated prices of intermediary book capital
risk remain largely positive (though become much less significant) across different asset classes,
consistent with idea that the market equity of financial institutions reflects more accurate and
timely information than their (accounting) book equity.
Outside the sample of primary dealers, we find that book and market capital ratio measures
are also highly correlated for the wider universe of publicly traded broker-dealers (all public US
30

One caveat is that the market value of an financial intermediary not only reflects the market value of the financial
assets on its balance sheet, but also includes the present value of its profits earned from future activities. Our view
is that this future enterprise value also affects the intermediary’s financial distress, and therefore will show up in its
pricing kernel.
31
In the accounting literature, there is some debate regarding accounting manipulations in the practice of mark-tomarket and indication that mark-to-market accounting is especially inaccurate during financial crises when capital
requirements and credit channels tighten (Heaton et al., 2010; Milbradt, 2012). Ball et al. (2012) provide a skeptical
assessment of mark-to-market accounting in a large sample of banks’ trading securities.
32
Previous literature such as Adrian et al. (2014b); Adrian and Shin (2014) show that market and book leverage
can be negatively correlated for banks, and therefore note that empirical analyses can be sensitive to choice of
market-based versus book-based measures.

firms with SIC 6211 or 6221, which includes some primary dealers). This group generally includes
smaller broker-dealers that mainly focus on securities trading. Here we find a 75% correlation
between market capital ratio and book capital ratio, again indicating reasonably accurate markingto-market.
The conclusion from this analysis is that the difference between market-based and book-based
measures of financial distress is unlikely to be responsible for the tension between our facts and
those of AEM.

4.3.2

Holding company vs. broker-dealer subsidiary

The more likely discrepancy between AEM and our paper is that we measure financial distress
at the holding company level for primary dealers, while the Flow of Funds data used by AEM
only aggregates balance sheet information at the broker-dealer subsidiary level. Most NY Fed
primary dealers are the broker-dealer subsidiaries of a large financial institutions holding companies.
Flow of Funds data come from quarterly FOCUS and FOGS reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) by these broker-dealer arms in isolation from other parts of their
larger institutions. The underlying Flow of Funds data is therefore not publicly available. However,
as most primary dealers are owned by publicly traded companies, market and financial statement
data for the holding company is widely available, and form the basis of our analysis. In short, our
definition of an intermediary is broader than AEM in the sense that we treat the entire holding
company as the observation of interest.33
The holding companies of primary dealers also often hold significant commercial banking businesses,34 making the distinction between holding company and broker-dealer arm potentially important. We find that the AEM implied capital ratio (i.e., the inverse of AEM leverage) is more
closely in line with the capital ratio of non-primary dealers (defined in Section 3.2.3) than that of
primary dealers. While the AEM implied capital ratio and that of our primary dealer sample are
strongly negatively correlated at -59%, the correlation between the AEM capital ratio and nonprimary dealer capital ratio is 71 percentage points higher, at positive 12%. As shown in Table
33

At the same time, by focusing on primary dealers, we hone in on only the largest and most active intermediaries.
By incorporating all broker-dealers that are subject to regulatory oversight, the Flow of Funds includes many small
and standalone dealers.
34
For instance, JP Morgan Securities LLC is the broker-dealer subsidiary of JP Morgan, and Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. fulfills that role under the Citigroup umbrella.

26

2 and discussed in Section 3.2.3, the small overall size of non-primary dealers suggests that the
broker-dealer business is the dominant segment in these firms. The large difference between the
correlations of AEM with primary versus non-primary dealers is consistent with the interpretation that AEM only captures the leverage of broker-dealer sector, while the holding companies of
primary dealers include other intermediary businesses with potentially different leverage patterns.
A key distinction between these two approaches—holding company data versus subsidiary-level
broker-dealer data—rests on the role of internal capital markets in the primary dealer’s holding
company. A well established view in corporate finance is that internal capital markets within a
conglomerate are likely to diversify and transmit adverse financial shocks across divisions (e.g.
Stein, 1997; Scharfstein and Stein, 2000). If internal capital markets are important sources of funds
for broker-dealer subsidiaries, then the capital ratio of the intermediary’s holding company is the
economically relevant measure of financial distress. In the banking literature, Houston et al. (1997),
Houston and James (1998) and de Haas and van Lelyveld (2010) show evidence to this effect. For
instance, Houston et al. (1997) show that a bank subsidiary’s loan growth more strongly correlates
with the holding company’s capital position than with the subsidiary’s own capital position.
In addition to the loan business, two anecdotes support the view that internal capital markets
play an important role in the financial health of broker-dealer subsidiaries. The first is the 2008
failure of Lehman Brothers. The bankruptcy examiner describes Lehman Brothers Holdings as a
“central banker” for Lehman subsidiaries (Valukas, 2010, Vol. 5, p. 1944). Its broker-dealer units
(the European in particular) required significant funding to unwind its prime brokerage services
in the days immediately prior to the September 15, 2008 bankruptcy filing. The holding company
attempted to avoid bankruptcy by using its liquid non-broker-dealer assets to guarantee the obligations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries to their clearing banks. This glimpse at the internal markets
of a large financial institution at the peak of its financial distress indicates the fungibility of capital
within broker-dealer holding companies. This point is further corroborated by the bankruptcy case
of the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group in 1990, which led to the liquidation of its broker-dealer
affiliate. In the three weeks before it filed for bankruptcy, approximately $220 million was transferred to the holding company from its broker-dealer arm in the form of short-term loans. This
instance of capital siphoning led the SEC to initiate group-wide risk assessments for all financial

27

institutions with significant broker-dealer subsidiaries.35
Of course, if internal capital markets within the holding company malfunction, then the financial
distress of the primary dealer might be more directly reflected by the broker-dealer arm’s own
capital structure. The importance of internal capital markets is ultimately an empirical question.
Our evidence based on holding company financial ratios indirectly supports the view that internal
markets are important to understanding the effect of intermediary distress on asset prices.

4.4

Differences in theoretical motivation

The interpretation of differences in our empirical results is complicated by the fact that different
intermediary models predict different signs for the price of risk on intermediary capital shocks.
In this subsection we discuss the theoretical distinction between two classes of intermediary asset
pricing models, which we dub either “equity constraint” or “debt constraint” models.
The equity constraint framework originates with net worth-based based models such as Bernanke
and Gertler (1989) and Holmstrom and Tirole (1997), and is exemplified by He and Krishnamurthy
(2013, 2012) and Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014). In these models, an adverse shock to the
intermediary’s equity capital reduces its risk bearing capacity. This leads to a fall in asset prices
which directly increases the intermediary’s leverage (holding debt fixed). At the same time, this rise
in leverage is countervailed by the intermediary endogenously reducing its debt financing. In general
equilibrium, the fall in equity values outweighs the debt reduction, and equilibrium leverage rises
(this is especially true when there is no debt constraint, as in He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013);
Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014)). In other words, from the standpoint of the intermediary,
leverage is counter-cyclical, rising in distress states where the intermediary values its wealth the
most. This corresponds to a negative price of leverage risk, or a positive price of capital ratio risk.
Another group of models, exemplified by Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), and Adrian and
Shin (2014), are set in a “debt constraint” framework.36 These models rule out equity financing by
assumption; instead, they focus on a time-varying debt (or leverage) constraint that affects equilibrium pricing. The models are often static and feature a binding collateralized borrowing constraint,

Credit dated September 14, 2006, and Adoption of Amendments to SEC Rule 15c3-1 Regarding Withdrawals of Net

28

either motivated by a value-at-risk constraint as in Adrian and Shin (2014) or an endogenous haircut as in Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009). Bad times correspond to a tightening of the debt
constraint reflected as lower allowable leverage, and this triggers deleveraging and fire-sales during
which assets are sold to some second-best user at a lower equilibrium price. This directly implies
that leverage is pro-cyclical in these models—debt falls in those states where debt constraints bind
the most and intermediary marginal value of wealth is highest. This corresponds to a positive price
for leverage risk, or a negative price of capital ratio risk.
This classification of theories, while in some ways over-simplified,37 is meant to clearly delineate
how different financial constraints can give rise to different equilibrium leverage patterns. More
importantly, we believe that given the spectrum of complexities in real world financial intermediation that these models may be attempting to describe, it should not be surprising that different
intermediary models give opposing predictions. It is likely that intermediaries face both equity and
debt constraints to varying degrees in different states of the world, leading to more nuanced and
complex behavior than either class alone can generate.
A related possibility is that these two model classes describe different intermediary sub-sectors
that interact in financial markets. He et al. (2010) and Ang et al. (2011) describe one example
that supports this view. During a downturn when marginal value of wealth is likely to be high
for all investors, hedge funds (who are perhaps closer to the type of intermediary described by
debt constraint models) sell their assets to commercial banks (who may be better described by
equity constraint models), and so leverage of these two sectors moves in opposite directions. In the
appendix we present a simplified static equilibrium model that combines features of Brunnermeier
and Pedersen (2009) and He and Krishnamurthy (2012) into an intermediary model with two
sub-sectors. It illustrates how a debt-constrained “hedge fund” sector has procyclical leverage in
equilibrium while leverage of the equity-constrained “bank” sector is countercyclical.
An interesting direction for future theory is to investigate different economic conditions under
which debt or equity constraints are more likely to impact asset values, and to use this to guide
37

For instance, Garleanu and Pederson (2011) build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with margin
constraints, which correspond to “debt constraint” in our language. However, the dynamic nature of that model
implies that the margin/debt contrasint does not bind in the normal state of world, and binds only after a sequence
of sufficiently negative shocks. This occasionally binding constraint is similar to He and Krishnamurthy (2013, 2012).
In Garleanu and Pederson (2011), because the deleveraging force is relatively weak in “normal” times when the
constraint does not bind, there is no simple monotonic relationship between leverage and state of the world.

29

construction of a more sophisticated pricing kernel that nests both mechanisms in a state-dependent
manner. And, ultimately, it is an empirical question whether our capital risk factor, the AEM
leverage factor, or some combination is the most useful representation of the pricing kernel.

5

Robustness

This section presents an array of robustness tests that support our main findings.

5.1

Pre-crisis and post-1990 subsamples

Table 11 presents the performance of our intermediary capital risk factor and the AEM leverage
factor during the 1970Q1–2006Q4 sample, which excludes the dramatic fluctuations associated with
the financial crisis. This test is designed to address the concern that average returns in some asset
classes are unduly influenced by the crisis subsample. We find that pre-crisis prices of capital ratio
risk are substantially smaller in three asset classes, US bonds, sovereign bonds, and commodities.
In the other four asset classes, the price of intermediary capital risk remains economically large.
In the “all portfolios” case, the risk price estimate is 9% per quarter, identical to that in the full
sample and highly significant.
We separately investigate the recent sample beginning in 1990 in Table 12. The capital risk price
estimate remains economically large in five of the seven asset classes (the exceptions are equities
and US bonds). The “all portfolios” estimate remains positive and significant, both economically
and statistically.

5.2

Monthly frequency

Our main analysis focuses on the quarterly frequency, corresponding to the frequency of balance
sheet data going into our capital ratio measure. Similarly, AEM construct their leverage factor
based on the accounting Flow of Funds data and is only available at the quarterly frequency.
An advantage of using CRSP data is that we can update the capital ratio as new market equity
data arrives each month. As a result, one can construct the monthly capital ratio for primary
dealers by using the monthly market equity information from CRSP, together with the most recent
quarterly book debt of their holding companies in Compustat. We repeat our cross section analysis

30

at the monthly frequency.
Table 13 presents the results. The estimated price of intermediary capital risk remains positive
for all asset classes. The magnitudes of estimates are now in monthly terms, and should therefore be
multiplied by three in order to compare with our quarterly estimates in Table 5. The monthly price
of capital risk is noticeably weaker for equities and US bonds, but remains economically meaningful
in the other five asset classes. In the “all portfolios” test, the risk price estimate is 4% per month
and highly statistically significant.
Our use of the most recently reported quarterly debt ignores within-quarter variation in the debt
taken by primary dealers. This approximation may hurt our model performance at the monthly
frequency, if the time-series variation in book debt plays a role in driving the pricing power of our
intermediary capital risk factor. From Table 7 in Section 3.2.4 we observe that book debt growth
does possess some pricing power, which suggests a potential explanation for the weaker monthly
performance of our intermediary capital risk factor.

5.3

Time-series return predictability

A common prediction of dynamic intermediary asset pricing models is that the risk premium is
time-varying, implying predictability in asset returns based on lagged state variables that captures
financial distress. We perform time-series predictive regressions in each asset class to evaluate this
prediction.
Our framework requires additional structure to derive the time-varying risk premium, which is
typically a nonlinear function of the state variable. In a simplified version of He and Krishnamurthy
(2012) that focuses on the risk of intermediary capital ratio, the risk price can be described as

λη = γV art

(11)

In words, the risk premium is linear in the squared reciprocal of the capital ratio of the intermediary
sector.
Guided by (11), we regress the one-year holding period return on an equal weighted portfolio

31

of assets within each class on the lagged inverse of the squared intermediary capital ratio:
k
Rt+1→t+4
− rtf = ak + bk

1
+ ut+1→t+4 .
ηt2

(12)

The model predicts a positive bk coefficient in Equation (11) because low intermediary capital ratio
(high leverage) states are associated with low expected future returns. The model’s prediction is
generally supported by Table 14, which reports a significantly positive b̂k for five of the seven asset
classes at the 10% significance level, and in four classes is significant at the 5% significance level.
The dependent variable in the last column of Table 14 is the weighted average of individual asset
class portfolio returns, with weights inversely proportional to the unconditional standard deviation
of a portfolio’s return. This weighting scheme accounts for the fact that volatilities differ markedly
across asset classes, so prediction results for an equal-weighted average would be driven by a subset
of the highest volatility portfolios. We find a positive one-year-ahead predictive coefficient in the
“all portfolios” test with a t-statistic of 2.89.38
For comparison, we also report predictive regression results for AEM, replaces 1/ηt2 with their
broker-dealer leverage ratio. The predictive coefficients are negative (as AEM would predict) in six
out of seven classes, and are significant in four classes at the 10% level.

5.4

Single factor models

Our main analysis focuses on a two-factor structure for the pricing kernel. Although the economic
rationale to include the market return is standard, the empirical price of risk associated with the
market return is generally insignificant in Table 5. Here we consider a one-factor specification that
omits the market return.
Table 15 presents the estimation results. The only meaningful difference compared to our
main results in Table 5 appears in the case of the 25 Fama-French portfolios, where the price of
our intermediary capital risk is insignificant while the AEM result remains strong. This result is
consistent with the horse-race outcomes in Table 10 where AEM leverage drives out our capital
ratio factor in the equity market. But, for all other asset classes, the primary dealer capital ratio
consistently carries a positive and significant risk price, while the AEM leverage risk price estimates

Test statistics in Table 14 use Hodrick (1992) standard errors to adjust for the fact that annual returns are being
forecast using overlapping quarterly observations.

32

take opposite signs in CDS, Options, and FX markets. The take-away is basically the same as from
the baseline two-factor model.

5.5

Intermediary equity return

As explained in equation (4) in Section 2.2, the representative intermediary’s pricing kernel only
depends on its own net worth WtI , a result that holds exactly for log preferences (e.g., He and
Krishnamurthy (2012)). A similar derivation to equation (3) implies that the return on the intermediary’s equity should be a sufficient statistic for the intermediary pricing kernel.
We test this single factor asset pricing model by constructing the value-weighted equity return
for the primary dealer sector,39 and report the estimated price of the primary dealers’ equity return
in Table 16. We find a significantly positive price for all asset classes other than the Fama-French
25 portfolios at the 10% level. For the “all portfolio” test, the estimated price is positive and
significant based on the Fama-MacBeth t-statistics but not the GMM t-statistics.
Recall that the single factor model with the factor being intermediary equity return holds only
under log preferences. This is because the pricing kernel is the marginal investor’s marginal utility
of consumption, and the consumption of log investors is always a constant fraction of their wealth.
But if the representative intermediary has recursive preferences, then future market prospects (say
persistent TFP shocks) will in general enter the intermediary’s pricing kernel, suggesting some
reduce-form specification in line with (2). Indeed, when we include the market return as another
factor in panel (b) of Table 15, we recover estimates that are closely in line with our baseline results
from Table 5. In particular, the estimated price of intermediary equity return factor is positive and
significant throughout. Overall, the results in this table suggest that primary dealers’ equity return
plays a similar role as the capital risk factor, offering further evidence in support of intermediary
asset pricing models.

5.6

Comparison with other factors

A large literature investigates factors that explain the cross section of asset returns. These analyses
focus on the pricing of US equities and have not been tested as pricing factors in many of the
39
This value-weighted equity return is slightly different from the intermediary (market) equity growth rate constructed in Section 3.2.4. The latter “intermediary equity growth rate” includes new equity issuance, while the equity
return does not.

33

asset classes we study. In Table 17, we compare the pricing power of our intermediary capital
ratio factor relative to the CAPM, the Fama and French (1993, 2015) three- and five-factor models,
the momentum factor, and the Pástor and Stambaugh (2003) liquidity factor. The table reports
the cross section R2 and MAPE with and without the intermediary capital factor. Including the
intermediary capital factor improves the cross-sectional R2 in the “all portfolios” test by 15% and
reduces the MAPE by 27% relative to the Fama-French five-factor model. In all cases, the estimated
price of intermediary capital risk is essentially unchanged by inclusion of other commonly studied
factors, and remains significant with a GMM t-statistic of at least 2.56.40

5.7

Cross-sectional tests without an intercept

The empirical specification (8) allows the intercept γk , to vary across asset classes. The theory
discussed in Section 3.2.2, however, predicts that γk = 0 for all k as in (9). This additional
theoretical restriction might not be valid given potential model misspecification; however, it may
matter for the empirical cross-asset pattern of estimated prices of intermediary capital risk λkη .
In Table 18 we repeat our main cross-sectional regressions without an intercept. We find that
constraining the intercept to zero has a minor impact on the prices of intermediary capital risk that
we estimate and, if anything, their statistical significance improves.

6

Conclusion

We find that differences in assets’ exposure to innovations in the capital ratio of primary dealers
explain variation in expected excess returns on equities, US bonds, foreign sovereign bonds, options,
CDS, commodities, and currencies. Our intermediary capital risk factor carries a positive price of
risk and is strongly pro-cyclical, implying counter-cyclical intermediary leverage. Our findings lend
new empirical support to the view that financial intermediaries are marginal investors in many
asset classes, and in turn support the view that the financial soundness of these intermediaries is
important for understanding wide ranging asset price behavior.
40
Because our capital ratio factor is non-traded and theoretically motivated, statistically oriented models such as
the Fama-French three and five-factor models are not natural benchmarks for comparison. In the words of Cochrane
(2005), “it is probably not a good idea to evaluate economically interesting models with statistical horse races against
models that use portfolio returns as factors.... Add any measurement error, and the economic model will underperform
its own mimicking portfolio. And both models will always lose in sample against ad hoc factor models that find nearly
ex post efficient portfolios.” Nonetheless, some readers may find the comparison is informative.

Appendix

The purpose of this appendix is to offer a general equilibrium framework to reconcile the empirical regularities documented in Adrian et al. (2014a) and our paper. For simplicity the model will be cast in a one-period setting, although
given the “myopic” objective of agents (risk neutral and log preferences) the analysis will be valid in a dynamic
setting. We do not solve for equilibrium asset prices. Instead, we focus on the implications of general equilibrium
leverage patterns for heterogeneous financial sectors, taking as given some well-known equilibrium properties of statedependent asset pricing moments established in the literature. A version of this model was proposed in a conference
discussion of our paper by Alexi Savov, to whom we are grateful for the suggestion.
The model combines the key features of He and Krishnamurthy (2012) and Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009).
There are three classes of agents. “Households” are assumed to only hold zero net supply riskless assets with an
endogenous return of rf , due to lack of sophistication or infinite risk-aversion. “Hedge funds” are risk-neutral but
face a VaR constraint that binds in equilibrium, as in Adrian and Shin (2014). They are meant to represent the
group of intermediaries (dealers and hedge funds) studied in Adrian et al. (2014a). “Banks” are risk-averse and
have mean-variance preferences, with an absolute risk aversion of γ, following He and Krishnamurthy (2012), and
correspond to the holding companies of primary dealers that our paper studies. Hedge funds and banks both actively
trade in the risky asset market, which offers an endogenous return of R.
Of course, in practice holding companies are likely to include both proprietary trading and traditional banking
businesses.41 And, in our framework, the financial health of the commercial banking sector matters for the equilibrium
pricing of sophisticated financial assets if internal capital markets in holding companies are well-functioning.
Denote aggregate wealth by W . The wealth (net worth) of the hedge fund sector is denoted by W HF ≡ wHF W ,
and the wealth of bankers by W B ≡ wB W . The lower case symbols wHF and wB indicate the wealth fraction of each
sector relative to the whole economy. Both dealers and banks can take on leverage, so that their asset positions X j
Xj
may be greater than their net worth W j , j ∈ {HF, B}. Denote the leverage choice as αj ≡ W
j (assets over equity),
j
and the resulting portfolio return by Rt+1 . Then we have

Finally, we have the market clearing condition. Because only hedge funds and banks can hold risky assets, we have
wB αB + wHF αHF = 1.

(A.3)

We first explain how our model is able to generate leverage patterns found in the data. The solution for αHF
shows that hedge funds have lower leverage in bad states, when σR,t tends to be high (He and Krishnamurthy (2012),
Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)). That is, hedge funds have procyclical leverage. Also, because both hedge
funds and banks take on leverage (and households save) in equilibrium, it is easy to show that their wealth shares
wB and wHF go down following negative fundamental shocks.42 Combining the two results above, (A.3) implies
D
that αB = 1−wwBαD increases in bad states, so banks have countercyclical leverage in equilibrium. Intuitively, this
41

The latter is more likely to face equity-based constraints. Given deposit guarantees, the US commercial banking
system is able to attract demand deposits even during severe crises like that in 2008.
B
42
Take banks as an example. Leverage implies that dW
< dW
following a negative shock. I.e., banks experience

a worse equity return than the aggregate market. But

correponds to the situation in which hedge funds sell their assets to commercial banks after negative shocks, and the
leverages of these two sectors move in the opposite directions. This pattern is empirically supported by He et al.
(2010) and Ang et al. (2011).
We briefly discuss how we map the pricing kernel in this simple model to the one used in our paper. In this
simple model banks are always marginal in pricing any asset. Given their mean variance preferences, the “CAPM”
type of result holds if one use the banks’ equity return as the pricing kernel, similar to He and Krishnamurthy (2012).
Naturally, the leverage of hedge funds can also be used to represent the pricing kernel, as in Adrian et al. (2014a),
because hedge fund leverage αD perfectly (negatively) correlates with bank equity.

Figure 1: Intermediary Capital Ratio and Risk Factor
Intermediary capital risk factor (dashed line) is AR(1) innovations to the market-based capital ratio of
primary dealers (solid line), scaled by the lagged capital ratio. Both time-series are standardized to zero
mean and unit variance for illustration. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. The intermediary capital
ratio is the ratio of total market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market equity) of primary
dealer holding companies. Shaded regions indicate NBER recessions.

Figure 2: Intermediary Capital Risk Price λη Estimates by Asset Class
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio, from a two-factor model that includes the
excess return on the market. Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-by-period cross-sectional regressions of
portfolio excess returns on risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in a first-stage time-series regression.
The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. The intermediary capital ratio is the ratio of total market equity
to total market assets (book debt plus market equity) of primary dealer holding companies. Shocks to capital
ratio are defined as AR(1) innovations in the capital ratio, scaled by the lagged capital ratio. The AEM
leverage factor, defined as the seasonally adjusted growth rate in broker-dealer book leverage level from Flow
of Funds, is from its authors. Solid error bars are the 95% confidence interval around the point estimates,
calculated using Fama-MacBeth standard errors that adjust for cross-asset correlation in the residuals.
Dotted error bars use the more robust GMM standard errors that additionally correct for estimation error
of the time-series betas.

Figure 4: Intermediary Capital Measures Comparison
Sub-Figure (a) compares our main state variable of interest, the aggregate market-based capital ratio of
NY Fed primary dealers with other measures of intermediary capital. Market capital ratio at t is defined
Σi marketequityit
as Σi (marketequity
, where market equity is outstanding shares multiplying stock price, and book
it +bookdebtit )
debt is total asset minus common equity AT − CEQ. Book capital ratio simply replaces marketequityt
with bookequityt in this calculation. AEM leverage ratio is the leverage ratio of the broker-dealer sector
used by Adrian et al. (2014a), constructed from Federal Reserve Z.1 security brokers and dealers series:
Total Financial Assets (FL664090005) divided by Total Financial Assets (FL664090005) less Total Liabilities
(FL664190005). In Sub-Figure (a), the capital ratios are in the scale of percentage points (i.e., 5 means 5%).
Sub-Figure (b) draws a similar comparison for the risk factors (innovations in the state variables). Our main
asset pricing factor is AR(1) innovations to the market-based capital ratio of primary dealers, scaled by the
lagged capital ratio. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. The AEM leverage factor, defined as the
seasonally adjusted growth rate in broker-dealer book leverage level from Flow of Funds, is from its authors.

Table 1: Primary Dealers as of February 11, 2014
Primary dealers, as designated by the New York Fed serve as its trading counterparties as it implements monetary policy. Primary dealers are obliged to: (i) participate consistently in open market operations to carry
out US monetary policy; and (ii) provide the NY Fed’s trading desk with market information and analysis.
Primary dealers are also required to participate in all US government debt auctions and to make reasonable
markets for the NY Fed. From 1960 to 2014 a total of 168 dealers were designated as primary ones, some
of whom lost this designation previously. See http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers.html for
current and historical lists of primary dealers.

Average sizes of prime dealers relative to all broker-dealers (BD), all banks (Banks), and all firms in Compustat (Cmptust). At the end of each month,
we calculate the total assets (and book debt, book equity, and market equity) of prime dealers and divide them by the total for the comparison group.
To make the samples comparable, we focus in this table only on US-based primary dealer holding companies that are in the CRSP-Compustat data.
We report the time series average of this ratio in each sample period.

Table 3: Pair-wise Correlations
Time-series pair-wise correlations over the 1970Q1–2012Q4 sample. Market Capital (ratio) is defined as the
ratio of total market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market equity) of primary dealer holding
companies, constructed using CRSP-Compustat and Datastream data. Market equity is outstanding shares
multiplying stock price, and book debt is total asset minus common equity AT − CEQ. Market Capital
Factor is our main asset pricing factor defined as AR(1) innovations to the market capital ratio, scaled
by the lagged capital ratio. Book Capital and Book Capital Factor are similarly defined, but uses book
equity instead of market equity. The AEM implied capital is the inverse of broker-dealer book leverage from
Flow of Funds used in AEM, and the AEM leverage factor (LevF ac) is from its authors which is defined
as the seasonally adjusted growth rate in broker-dealer book leverage from Flow of Funds. Correlation for
factors are with growth (log change) of the earnings-to-price ratio, Unemployment, GDP, the Chicago Fed
National Financial Conditions Index (high level means poor financial conditions), or realized volatility of
CRSP value-weighted stock index.

Table 5: Cross-sectional Asset Pricing Tests by Asset Class
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio and the excess return on the market. The
capital ratio is defined as the ratio of total market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market
equity) of primary dealer holding companies. Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-by-period crosssectional regressions of portfolio excess returns on risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in a first-stage
time-series regression. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is in
percentage terms. Relative risk aversion (RRA) is the price of intermediary capital risk factor, scaled by
its variance. Fama-MacBeth t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for cross-asset correlation in the residuals. The more
robust GMM t-statistics (t-GMM) additionally correct for estimation error of the time-series betas.

defined as US firms with an SIC code that does not start with 6. Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-byperiod cross-sectional regressions of portfolio excess returns on risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in
a first-stage time-series regression. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. The intermediary capital ratio
is the ratio of total market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market equity) of primary dealer
holding companies. Shocks to capital ratio are defined as AR(1) innovations in the capital ratio, scaled by
the lagged capital ratio. The AEM leverage factor, defined as the seasonally adjusted growth rate in brokerdealer book leverage level from Flow of Funds, is from its authors. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is

Table 10: Horse-races with the AEM Leverage Factor
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio (Capital), the Adrian et al. (2014a) leverage
factor (AEM), and the excess return on the market. Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-by-period
cross-sectional regressions of portfolio excess returns on risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in a
first-stage time-series regression. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. The intermediary capital ratio
is the ratio of total market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market equity) of primary dealer
holding companies. Shocks to capital ratio are defined as AR(1) innovations in the capital ratio, scaled by
the lagged capital ratio. The AEM leverage factor, defined as the seasonally adjusted growth rate in brokerdealer book leverage level from Flow of Funds, is from its authors. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is
in percentage terms. Relative risk aversion (RRA) is the price of intermediary capital risk factor, scaled by
its variance. Fama-MacBeth t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for cross-asset correlation in the residuals. The more
robust GMM t-statistics (t-GMM) additionally correct for estimation error of the time-series betas.

Table 11: Cross-sectional Asset Pricing Tests by Asset Class: Pre-crisis Sample
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio (HKM) or the Adrian et al. (2014a) leverage
factor (AEM), and the excess return on the market. Here we focus on the pre-crisis quarterly sample
1970Q1–2006Q4. Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-by-period cross-sectional regressions of portfolio
excess returns on risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in a first-stage time-series regression. The
intermediary capital ratio is the ratio of total market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market
equity) of primary dealer holding companies. Shocks to capital ratio are defined as AR(1) innovations in the
capital ratio, scaled by the lagged capital ratio. The AEM leverage factor, defined as the seasonally adjusted
growth rate in broker-dealer book leverage level from Flow of Funds, is from its authors. Mean absolute
pricing error (MAPE) is in percentage terms. Relative risk aversion (RRA) is the price of intermediary capital
risk factor, scaled by its variance. Fama-MacBeth t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for cross-asset correlation in
the residuals. The more robust GMM t-statistics (t-GMM) additionally correct for estimation error of the
time-series betas.

Table 13: Cross-sectional Tests at the Monthly Frequency
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio and the excess return on the market. The
monthly sample is January 1970 to December 2012. The monthly intermediary capital ratio here is the
ratio of total market equity (measured monthly) to total market assets (book debt plus market equity) of
primary dealer holding companies, where book debt is the latest quarterly observation. Shocks to capital
ratio are defined as AR(1) innovations in the capital ratio, scaled by the lagged capital ratio. Risk prices are
the mean slopes of period-by-period cross-sectional regressions of portfolio excess returns on risk exposures
(betas). Betas are estimated in a first-stage time-series regression. The AEM leverage factor, defined as
the seasonally adjusted growth rate in broker-dealer book leverage level from Flow of Funds, is from its
authors. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is in percentage terms. Relative risk aversion (RRA) is the
price of intermediary capital risk factor, scaled by its variance. Fama-MacBeth t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for
cross-asset correlation in the residuals. The more robust GMM t-statistics (t-GMM) additionally correct for
estimation error of the time-series betas.

Table 14: Predictive Regressions by Asset Class
One-year-ahead predictive regression results for each asset class. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4.
We regress the mean return on all assets of an asset class on lagged intermediary leverage, which is either the
squared inverse of the intermediary capital ratio (HKM), or the Adrian et al. (2014a) leverage ratio (AEM).
Regression coefficients are multiplied by 100. Hodrick (1992) t-statistics are reported in parentheses.

(b) Two Factor Model

Table 16: Intermediary Equity Return
The capital factor considered here is the value-weighted equity return of primary dealers. Panel (a) reports
risk price estimates for primary dealers’ equity return alone, while Panel (b) also includes the excess return
on the market. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. The intermediary capital ratio is the ratio of total
market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market equity) of primary dealer holding companies.
Shocks to capital ratio are defined as AR(1) innovations in the capital ratio, scaled by the lagged capital
ratio. The AEM leverage factor, defined as the seasonally adjusted growth rate in broker-dealer book
leverage level from Flow of Funds, is from its authors. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is in percentage
terms. Relative risk aversion (RRA) is the price of intermediary capital risk factor, scaled by its variance.
Fama-MacBeth t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for cross-asset correlation in the residuals. The more robust GMM
t-statistics (t-GMM) additionally correct for estimation error of the time-series betas.

Table 17: Comparison with Commonly-used Pricing Factors
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio and the excess return on the market,
controlling for commonly used benchmark pricing factors. All test portfolios are included in all columns.
The capital ratio is defined as the ratio of total market equity to total market assets (book debt plus market
equity) of primary dealer holding companies. Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-by-period crosssectional regressions of portfolio excess returns on risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in a first-stage
time-series regression. The quarterly sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is in
percentage terms. Relative risk aversion (RRA) is the price of intermediary capital risk factor, scaled by
its variance. Fama-MacBeth t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for cross-asset correlation in the residuals. The more
robust GMM t-statistics (t-GMM) additionally correct for estimation error of the time-series betas. The
bottom two statistics are R2 and MAPE for similar specifications but without the intermediary capital risk
factor.

Table 18: Cross-sectional Tests without an Intercept
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio (HKM) or the Adrian et al. (2014a) leverage
factor (AEM), and the excess return on the market, without an intercept in the cross-sectional regression.
Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-by-period cross-sectional regressions of portfolio excess returns on
risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in a first-stage time-series regression. The quarterly sample is
1970Q1–2012Q4. The intermediary capital ratio is the ratio of total market equity to total market assets
(book debt plus market equity) of primary dealer holding companies. Shocks to capital ratio are defined as
AR(1) innovations in the capital ratio, scaled by the lagged capital ratio. The AEM leverage factor, defined
as the seasonally adjusted growth rate in broker-dealer book leverage level from Flow of Funds, is from its
authors. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is in percentage terms. Relative risk aversion (RRA) is the
price of intermediary capital risk factor, scaled by its variance. Fama-MacBeth t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for
cross-asset correlation in the residuals. The more robust GMM t-statistics (t-GMM) additionally correct for
estimation error of the time-series betas.

Table A.1: Primary Dealers, 1960–2014
The New York Federal Reserve Bank’s list of primary dealers. We have condensed the list slightly by
combining entries that differ due to name changes but maintain continuity in primary dealer role, most
commonly due to the dealer acquiring another firm. However, we continue to list acquisition targets or
merged entities separately for the period that they appear on the dealer list prior to acquisition.

Table A.2: Book Equity instead of Market Equity
Risk price estimates for shocks to the intermediary capital ratio and the excess return on the market. Here,
the capital ratio is defined as the ratio of total book equity to total book assets of primary dealer holding
companies. Risk prices are the mean slopes of period-by-period cross-sectional regressions of portfolio excess
returns on risk exposures (betas). Betas are estimated in a first-stage time-series regression. The quarterly
sample is 1970Q1–2012Q4. Mean absolute pricing error (MAPE) is in percentage terms. Relative risk
aversion (RRA) is the price of intermediary capital risk factor, scaled by its variance. Fama-MacBeth
t-statistics (t-FM) adjust for cross-asset correlation in the residuals. The more robust GMM t-statistics
(t-GMM) additionally correct for estimation error of the time-series betas.
