ABSTRACT
Capital flow and commodity cycles have long been connected with economic crises. Sparse historical
data, however, has made it difficult to connect their timing. We date turning points in global capital
flows and commodity prices across two centuries and provide estimates from alternative data sources.
We then document a strong overlap between the ebb and flow of financial capital, the commodity
price super-cycle, and sovereign defaults since 1815. The results have implications for today, as many
emerging markets are facing a double bust in capital inflows and commodity prices, making them
vulnerable to crises.

Capital flow cycles and commodity price swings, as well as fluctuations in international
interest rates, have long been connected with economic crises, especially but not exclusively, in
emerging markets. 1 Narratives of capital flow surges that end badly have been around since the
19th century, if not earlier (e.g. Suter 1990). However, the sparse historical data on cross-border
transactions in financial assets has made it difficult to systematically connect the timing of
economic crises to the availability of international capital, especially in the pre-WW II era. This
paper takes a step toward filling that gap. We provide a first pass at dating turning points in
global capital flow and real commodity prices cycles across approximately two centuries.
Because of the significant variation across time and countries in the phenomenon we study and
in the availability and quality of the data, our methodology is (by necessity) eclectic. 2
There is a substantial time-series literature about commodity prices across decades and
sometimes centuries; but we are not aware of a comparable unified treatment of the recurring
booms and busts in cross-border capital flows at the global level. Our contribution is to study the
global cycle of capital flows over the very long run. We also touch on the connection between
the commodity price super-cycle and the ebb and flow of financial capital, although the issue is
studied in more detail in a companion paper (Reinhart et al. 2016). The impact of global
economic cycles is highly relevant today, since much of the emerging world faces a sobering
reversal of a double bonanza in capital inflows and primary commodity prices. By our
measurement, the trough in both commodity and capital flow cycles dates to 1999 and the peak
came in 2011, followed by a severe bust. This boom episode was the second longest boom in real
commodity prices since the late 18th century and one of the four longest inflow episodes since

1815. Not surprisingly given the historical context, this double bust has been associated with a 2
percentage point markdown in the IMF’s most recent forecast for 2015 growth in emerging
markets, from 6% to 4%.
We are also interested in the nexus between the end of capital flow bonanzas and
economic crises, specifically sovereign default. Before the widespread use of fiat money (which
popularized currency crashes and the occasional inflationary spiral after World War I) and well
before many countries had established domestic financial institutions (giving rise to the advent of
banking crises), there were sovereign default crises. As has been documented elsewhere, these
events usually entail significant and persistent economic dislocation.
Section II describes the data and empirical strategy used to date the capital-flow cycle.
Particular attention is devoted to measurement issues including a discussion on net versus gross
capital flows. The following section studies the connection between capital flow cycles and the
recurring waves of sovereign default documented in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) since 1800. The
last of these default waves came in the wake of rising international interest rates, collapsing
commodity prices, and a sharp capital flow reversal, as inflows peaked in 1981 (commodity
prices had peaked earlier). We conclude by re-capping our main findings and their implications
for the current cycle.
Section II. Data and Methodology
Capital flow accounting, and net and gross flows
The simple rules of double-entry accounting ensure that, excluding statistical
discrepancies, the capital account surplus, or net capital inflow (denoted by KA), is related to the
current account surplus (denoted by CA) and to changes in the official reserves account (denoted
2

by RA, where ∆RA < 0 implies the accumulation of reserves by the monetary authority) through
the identity:
CA + KA + ∆RA≡ 0.
A country that runs a current account deficit must finance this deficit either by a private
capital inflow or by a reduction in its official reserves. In both cases, the country runs down its
net foreign wealth. As data on capital/financial account balances is limited or nonexistent, we reconstruct the capital account (KA) by piecing together time series on the current account (CA)
and official reserves. Prior to World War II, official reserves were dominated by gold.
This exercise approximates net capital flows. Such measures may be available from
creditor countries (who record consistent net capital outflows), the debtor countries importing
capital, or (ideally) both. As in other studies of 19th century financial markets, much of the
capital flow activity and data used in this study comes from the United Kingdom, which
dominated finance until World War I. We also exploit that in recent years scholars have been
able to build longer time series on individual countries’ external transactions - usually the current
account. However for the earlier part of the 1800’s current account data is still rare among the
advanced economies and even rarer for emerging markets.
Fortunately, other data can provide an approximation to gross (and in some
circumstances net) international capital flows. Gross flows can be approximated by compiling
data on bond issuance. Kaminsky and Vega-Garcia (2014) have pioneered this approach, as they
document Latin America’s volatile external finance since independence. In effect, in the 1820s,
and even much later, gross capital inflows were very similar to net capital inflows for newlyminted nation-states that were borrowing in international capital markets for the first time. Also,
3

the work of Stone (1999) traces capital exports from the United Kingdom to 25 countries in five
continents over 1865-1914. See Reinhart et al. (2016) for more details on the dataset.
Figure 1 presents a panorama of the capital flow cycles of the 19th century. For 18151868, our data on bond issues covers 38 countries but is limited to sovereigns and subsovereigns. Private bond issuance played an increasingly prominent role in the latter part of the
century. The figure overlays the bond issuance data and gross capital exports from the UK to the
rest of the world with the UK current account (as a percent of GDP), which records net flows
from the dominant financier. Three features stand out.
First, the different measures of international capital flows provide a fairly consistent
narrative of the capital flow cycle. 3 Second, the peaks and valleys are, for the most part, sharp
and distinct. Third, the well-known ascent of global finance at the height of the Gold Standard
Era is evident in the upward trend in these series. Global capital flows since World War I are
aggregated from the constructed capital/financial account for individual countries, as described.
The building blocks (i.e., current account balances, official gold, and foreign exchange reserves)
are culled from a broad range of sources. The data availability and, thus, the country coverage
varies by period, as noted in Figure 2. The interwar sample is comprised of 34 countries, while
the post-World War II core group includes 68 countries. For many of these countries our time
series extend back to the 1860s and earlier. Not included in Figure 2, is an even more inclusive
sample of 132 capital importers for which we construct capital account data since 1980. 4

3

The correlation between gross capital exports from the UK and the current account (which abstracting from reserve
changes and errors and omission, should approximate net capital exports from the UK) is 0.77 over 1867-1914. The
correlation between bond issuance and the current account is notably lower (0.40) but statistically significant at the
1% level. In part, this may reflect that not all funds were raised in London, as Paris, Amsterdam, and other centers
were associated with some of the bonds issued during 1815-1868.

The larger sample does not appreciable change the pattern shown in Figure 2.

Defining the cycles and episodes: 1820-2015
Don Harding and Adrian Pagan (2002) provide a persuasive case for a simple and
mechanical scheme to date turning points in business cycles which we apply to the capital flow
and commodity price data. These two authors have also addressed the synchronization of two
cycles, which is of interest to describe the interplay of the individual capital flow and commodity
bonanza-bust cycles and helps to define the concept of a “Double Bonanza-Bust”.
This literature also counsels over-interpreting specific dates. For instance, the dating of
some bond issues is less than precise (some issues are listed as 1821-1822 and discrepancies
across sources are not uncommon). Information on disbursements of the funds (the actual capital
flow) varies and is not uniformly reported. Balance of payments accounts (past and present) are
subject to errors and omissions, which tend to worsen in times of turmoil when capital flight
escalates. Valuation changes affect the gold stock and reserves data.
With these caveats in mind, Table 1 presents the dates, duration and magnitudes of the
global boom and bust cycles in capital flows since 1815. Appendix Table A1 and the longer
working paper show a comparable exercise for real commodity prices. Most capital flow cycles
lasted 3-6 years, abstracting from the thirty-year stretch following World War II, during which
restrictions on cross-border financial transaction kept the volume of international capital flows
minimal. The capital flow bonanza that peaked in 2011 was exceptionally protracted (and came
to an abrupt reversal phase after the taper tantrum of the spring of 2013 when the Federal
Reserve announced its intention to taper its extended post-crisis stimulus).
III. The End of Bonanzas
While the longer companion piece to this paper provides detailed analysis of the

6

individual cycles and their connection (or not) to crises, Figure 3 provides a synthesis of the
overlap between capital flow booms, as in Table 1 (pale shading), and the waves of (new)
sovereign defaults. Darker shading in Figure 3 highlights double busts, meaning episodes where
a decline in capital inflows overlaps with a contraction in real commodity prices.

Notes: Shaded episodes denote a double (capital flow and commodity price) boom or bust. To qualify as a double
boom or bust, there must be at least two years of overlap in that phase of the cycle.
Sources: Reinhart et al. (2016). See also Data Appendix.

The capital inflow-default link is clear and consistent over time. Out of a total of 14
capital boom episodes, 11 were followed by a sharp increase in sovereign defaults after the boom
ended. All of the six major spikes in new defaults shown in Figure 3 occurred after a global
capital inflow bonanza ended. Moreover, four-out-of-these-six global default peaks can be
associated with double busts in capital and commodity markets (dark shading). Not every default
cycle is associated with collapsing commodity prices, as our sample includes countries that are
7

not primary commodity producers and would not be adversely affected by falling commodity
prices (see Reinhart et al. 2016).

Notes: Pale shaded areas denote global capital flow bonanzas. Dark shaded areas denote episodes of “double busts”.
Sources: See Table 1, Reinhart et al. (2016) and Data Appendix.

Table 2 examines the connection between capital flow cycles and defaults more
systematically. We use a dummy for the onset of sovereign defaults to external private creditors
as dependent variable and apply logit and OLS panel fixed effects regressions for more than 100
countries (lines 1 and 2). In line 3, we regress the global share of countries entering default in
each year between 1815 and 2015, using a fractional response logit model to account for the fact
that this share is bound between 0 and 1. The end of global capital flow bonanzas is associated
with a significant increase in sovereign default risk worldwide. The coefficients in line 2 suggest
that the risk of entering default increases by a total of 12 percentage points in the five post-boom
years (including the end year of booms as listed in the left panel of Table 1). This is very large
given that the unconditional probability of defaulting is just 2% in the full sample.

IV. Final Remarks
International capital flow cycles have displayed similar patterns over the past 200 years,
both in duration and amplitude. While not all capital inflow cycles ended with a global wave of
new debt crises, all the major spikes in sovereign defaults came in the heels of surges in capital
inflows, especially those followed by “double busts” in capital and commodity markets.

Notes: Capital inflows to 60 capital importers, excluding the United States. Since the end of the "double
bonanza" after 2011, the global share of sovereigns in default has risen from 3% to 6%. Historically, the
average increase after capital flow booms was 12 perc. points. For "double busts" it was 24 perc. points.

9

As shown in Table 3, the global economy has been subject to a double bust since 2012,
with a collapse in commodity prices and stark decline in capital inflows (and in some cases,
outflows). Since then, the worldwide incidence of sovereign defaults has risen only modestly.
Perhaps emerging market economies are more resilient this time around. But perhaps the
protracted nature of the downturn in international conditions has yet to take its cumulative toll.

Sovereign defaults

The data on sovereign defaults in Figure 3 and Tables 2 and 3 comes from the most recent vintage
of the dataset compiled by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). Only sovereign defaults to private external
creditors are included. The data does not consider sovereign defaults and arrears to official
creditors (e.g. other governments or the IMF). See Reinhart and Trebesch (2014, 2015) for data
updates and default data on official creditors.

Notes: The downturn in prices since the 2011 peak is still ongoing. A peak-to-trough price (trough-to-peak) decline
(increase) greater than or equal to 15% is classified as a bust (boom). Export prices of manufactures (in US dollars)
is used to deflate commodity prices.
