Quantitative Models of Commercial Policy
Ralph Ossa
NBER Working Paper No. 22062
March 2016
JEL No. F12,F13,O19
ABSTRACT
What tariffs would countries impose if they did not have to fear any retaliation? What would
occur if there was a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation? What would be the
outcome if countries engaged in fully efficient trade negotiations? And what would happen to
trade policy cooperation if the world trading system had a different institutional design? While
such questions feature prominently in the theoretical trade policy literature, they have proven
difficult to address empirically, because they refer to what-if scenarios for which direct empirical
counterparts are hard to find. In this chapter, I introduce research which suggests overcoming this
difficulty by applying quantitative models of commercial policy.

Introduction

At least since Johnsons (1953-54) pioneering analysis of optimal tari¤s and retaliation, whatif questions regarding potential policy scenarios have dominated the theoretical trade policy
literature: What tari¤s would countries impose if they did not have to fear any retaliation?
What would occur if there was a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation? What
would be the outcome if countries engaged in fully e¢cient trade negotiations? And what
would happen to trade policy cooperation if the world trading system had a di¤erent institutional design?
In this chapter, I introduce research which takes this theoretical literature to the data using
quantitative models of commercial policy. Quantitative models are a natural tool for empirical
work in this area because they are designed for counterfactual analyses. As a result, they can
shed light on the what-if scenarios emphasized in the theoretical literature without necessarily
requiring historical precedents. This is especially useful for key benchmark scenarios such as
fully escalated trade wars or fully e¢cient trade talks for which direct empirical counterparts
are hard to nd.
My particular focus is on quantitative research which assumes that trade policy choices
are made by optimizing governments. While this is a standard assumption in the theoretical literature, it has long been avoided in quantitative applications because of the unique
methodological challenges it brings about. As a result, little was known about the magnitudes of optimal tari¤s, the potential welfare costs of a breakdown of trade policy cooperation,
or the potential welfare gains which can be achieved in future trade negotiations. Instead,
quantitative analyses mainly focused on comparative statics exercises such as predicting the
e¤ects of particular trade agreements.
While this is still very much an emerging literature, I believe a separate introduction is
valuable to have since the required tools go beyond what is commonly used in the quantitative
trade literature. Moreover, excellent accounts of the broader quantitative trade literature are
already easy to obtain. In particular, a thorough introduction to traditional Quantitative
General Equilibrium (CGE) models is provided in the Handbook of Computable General
Equilibrium Modeling edited by Dixon and Jorgenson (2013). Moreover, a comprehensive

2

review of the more recent quantitative gravity literature building on the work of Eaton and
Kortum (2002) is available from the Handbook of International Economics chapter by Costinot
and Rodriguez-Clare (2014).1
My goal is to equip readers who are interested in this area with the knowledge required
to expand its frontier. Assuming no background in quantitative modeling, I provide an indepth discussion of the key tools, the key ndings, and the key limitations of the literature
so far. An integral part of this chapter is a programming toolkit which is available from the
accompanying website. It contains a set of fully documented MATLAB programs which can
be used to e¢ciently compute counterfactuals, optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative
tari¤s. While they are tailored to the workhorse model used in this chapter, they can be
easily modi ed to apply to other environments.
I structure my explanations around my analysis in Ossa (2014) which is the most comprehensive one available to date. However, I go beyond it by elaborating more extensively on the
underlying methods, including the "exact hat algebra" technique of Dekle et al (2007), the
elasticity estimations of Feenstra (1994), Broda and Weinstein (2006), and Caliendo and Parro
(2015), and the mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) algorithm
of Su and Judd (2012). The central theme throughout this chapter is numerical optimization
which di¤erentiates it from the abovementioned contribution of Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare
(2014). As will become clear shortly, this is a critical theme for this literature as challenges
associated with it have forced earlier studies to con ne attention to low dimensional setups
with only a few countries and industries.
To the best of my knowledge, there are only ve papers other than Ossa (2014) which
have seriously attempted to quantify trade policy equilibria featuring optimizing governments.
Hamilton and Whalley (1983) were the rst to attempt a serious calibration of optimal trade
policy. Employing simple CES speci cations on the demand and the supply side of the
economy, they explore optimal tari¤s with and without retaliation in a range of simple two
region, one import good models. They conclude that optimal tari¤s are far away from the
tari¤s observed in the data and that the margin for tari¤ retaliation in a worldwide tari¤ war

policy counterfactuals.

is potentially large.
Markusen and Wigle (1989) explore Nash equilibrium tari¤s and their welfare e¤ects in a
much richer numerical general equilibrium framework featuring scale economies and capital
mobility. While their framework allows for eight regions and six industries, they only consider
a tari¤ war between the US and Canada further constraining the tari¤s to vary proportionately
across all industries. They nd that the Nash equilibrium tari¤s are much lower than the ones
computed by Hamilton and Whalley (1983) and conjecture that this is due to scale economies
and capital mobility.
Perroni and Whalley (2000), Ossa (2011), and Ossa (2012) calculate optimal tari¤s with
and without retaliation in a quantitative Armington model, a quantitative Krugman (1980)
model with free entry, and a quantitative Krugman (1980) model without free entry, respectively. They now allow for seven instead of two regions but still assume that each country
imposes a single tari¤ against all imports from a given trading partner. While Perroni and
Whalley (2000) are particularly interested in the potential e¤ect of regional trade agreements
on Nash tari¤s, Ossas (2011, 2012) calculations are part of a broader attempt to explore
optimal trade policy in "new trade" environments.2
The quantitative approach discussed in this chapter is more closely related to the quantitative gravity literature pioneered by Eaton and Kortum (2002) than the traditional Computable
General Equilibrium (CGE) literature. As argued by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014),
this newer literature distinguishes itself by having more appealing micro-theoretical foundations, o¤ering a tighter connection between theory and data, and prioritizing transparency
over realism.
While this is true, it is also important to recognize that the di¤erences between newer
and older quantitative trade models are often overemphasized. For example, Eaton and
Kortum (2002) indeed develop a full-edged Ricardian model which has more appealing micro2
Rudimentary quantitative analyses can already be found in the early formal trade policy literature. Johnson
(1953-54) numerically calculated demand elasticity combinations for which a country gains or loses in a tari¤
war. His analysis was subsequently extended by Gorman (1958) to a broader class of models, by Kuga (1973)
to many countries and industries, and by Kennan and Riezman (1990) to allow for customs unions. While
numerical calculations feature prominently in all of these papers, they were clearly meant to be numerical
illustrations rather than serious calibration exercises. For completeness, let me also mention that Baldwin and
Clarke (1987) calculate various equilibria of a simple two-country tari¤ game which is meant to capture some
of the salient features of the Tokyo Round and that Alvarez and Lucas (2007) provide a short discussion of
optimal tari¤s in small open economies.

theoretical foundations than the ad-hoc Armington (1969) model the CGE literature typically
relies on. Yet, we now know from the work of Arkolakis et al (2012) that these models are
actually isomorphic in terms of their quantitative predictions so that these micro-theoretical
di¤erences matter much less than it originally seemed.
Also, some of the new techniques of connecting theory to data have close counterparts
in the earlier CGE literature. For example, the "exact hat algebra" approach of Dekle et al
(2007) closely resembles a standard method in the CGE literature of expressing equilibrium
conditions in "calibrated share form". In light of this, the main di¤erence between newer and
older quantitative trade models seems to be that important model parameters such as trade
elasticities are now usually estimated using the same model relationships that are then also
used for counterfactual analyses instead of just taken from existing studies in the literature.
In that sense, the newer quantitative trade literature comes somewhat closer to full-edged
structural estimation than the earlier CGE literature did even though it is still best described
as "theory with numbers" in my view. This means that its quantitative ndings so far should
not be taken at face value but rather as o¤ering a sense of the magnitudes. Of course, this is
not only interesting in its own right but can also provide valuable insights into the plausibility
of the underlying theory. For example, we will see that the trade war equilibrium predicted
by the benchmark model of this chapter seems broadly consistent with the observed trade
war following the Great Depression which is an encouraging result.
The remainder of this chapter is divided into three sections. The rst section introduces
the main methods, including the theoretical framework of Ossa (2014), the "exact hat algebra" technique of Dekle et al (2007), the elasticity estimations of Feenstra (1994), Broda and
Weinstein (2006), and Caliendo and Parro (2014), ways to deal with aggregate trade imbalances, and the MPEC algorithm of Su and Judd (2012). The second section illustrates these
methods in an application to 10 countries and 33 industries calculating optimal tari¤s, Nash
tari¤s, and e¢cient tari¤s. The last section considers a number of extensions which have been
analyzed in the literature and discusses ideas for future work.

Methods

2.1

Theory

In this section, I introduce the model of Ossa (2014) which I use as a workhorse model
throughout. As will become clear shortly, it nests many of the forces emphasized in the
theoretical literature, which makes it a natural starting point for quantitative trade policy
work. Having said this, none of the methods discussed in this chapter are speci c to this
model and could be applied readily to any of the other gravity models surveyed in Costinot
and Rodriguez-Clare (2015). I will further elaborate on this in the following and also point
to some speci c alternative models which seem particularly interesting to me.
2.1.1

Setup

There are N countries indexed mainly by i or j and S industries indexed mainly by s. Households have access to a continuum of di¤erentiated varieties and make their consumption
decisions according to the following nested Cobb-Douglas-CES utility functions:


Cj =

QS

s=1

X

N
i=1

Z

Mis

cijs (! is )

s 1
s

0

d! is

 s s 1 js

(1)

where cijs denotes consumption of an industry s variety from country i in country j, Mis is
the mass of industry s varieties produced in country i,  s > 1 is the elasticity of substitution
between industry s varieties, and js is the share of expenditure country j households spend on
industry s varieties. Households collect all labor income, pro ts, and tari¤ revenue generated
in the economy and there are a total of Li workers residing in country i.
Each consumption variety is produced by a single monopolistic rm. Firms hire labor
only, produce output using constant returns to scale technologies, and incur iceberg shipping
costs. Their technologies are summarized by the following inverse production functions:

lis =

XN

j=1

ijs cijs
'is

(2)

where lis is the amount of labor hired by an industry s rm in country i, 'is is the productivity

6

of industry s rms in country i, and ijs > 1 is an iceberg trade barrier in the sense that
ijs units of an industry s variety have to be shipped out of country i for one unit to arrive
in country j. There are no

xed costs of production and the mass of

rms is exogenous

everywhere.
Governments impose import tari¤s but do not have access to other policy instruments. I
denote the ad valorem tari¤ imposed by country j against industry s imports from country
i by tijs , where tijs  0 for all i 6= j and tijs = 0 for all i = j, and de ne the shorthand
 ijs  1 + tijs for future use. Government preferences are given by:

Gj =

XS

s=1

js Wjs

(3)

where Wjs is the welfare of industry s in country j and js is a political economy weight. I
will elaborate on the details of this speci cation in the application section and for now only
consider the special case of welfare maximizing governments which arises if js = 1 for all j
and s which then implies Gj = Cj .3
Notice that this model is a hybrid between a multi-sector Krugman (1980) model and a
multi-sector Armington (1969) model. Unlike a standard Krugman (1980) model, it abstracts
from xed costs of production and does not allow for free entry. Unlike a standard Armington
(1969) model, it features imperfect competition and products which are di¤erentiated at the
level of rms. These modi cations ensure that there are no corner solutions and that there
is more to trade policy than just terms-of-trade e¤ects. While this is useful in practice, it is
in no way critical for the applicability of the methods discussed in this chapter which can be
used for any gravity model as indicated before.4
3

As will become clear in the application section, industry welfare is simply de ned as nominal industry
income deated by the ideal aggregate price index which then sums to total real income or total welfare if
js = 1 for all j and s.
4
Readers familiar with the work of Arkolakis et al (2012) will know that these models anyway all have the
same predictions in the special case of one industry. However, as soon as there is more than one industry,
di¤erences between these models emerge in the sense that "new trade" production relocation or pro t shifting
e¤ects appear in addition to traditional terms-of-trade e¤ects in imperfectly competitive environments.

2.1.2

Equilibrium in levels

Utility maximization implies that rms in industry s of country i face demands:

cijs =

(pis ijs  ijs )
1 s
Pjs

s

js Ej

(4)

where pis is the ex-factory price set by industry s rms in country i, Pjs is the ideal price
index of industry s varieties in country j, and Ej is the total expenditure of consumers in
country j.
Pro t maximization requires that rms charge a constant markup over marginal costs:

pis =

 s wi
 s 1 'is

(5)

where wi is the wage rate in country i. This also implies that pro ts account for a fraction
1

This is, of course, just a standard gravity equation decomposing bilateral trade ows into
bilateral trade costs as well as origin and destination e¤ects. Notice that the elasticity of
trade with respect to tari¤s is di¤erent from the elasticity of trade with respect to iceberg

8

trade costs. This is simply because the considered trade ows are evaluated at ex-factory
prices which are net of tari¤s but gross of iceberg trade costs.
Recall that all labor incomes, pro ts, and tari¤ revenues ultimately accrue to households
which can be captured by the budget constraint:

Since a fraction

distributed as labor income. As a result:

This can also be interpreted as a labor market clearing condition since it reduces to Li =

For given tari¤s, conditions (7) - (9) jointly determine the equilibrium of the model. For

future reference, it is useful to summarize this in De nition 1:

Notice that the equilibrium for given tari¤s could be summarized in a very similar fashion
9

in other gravity models. For example, a multi-sector Armington (1969) model would feature
the same conditions with the exceptions that there would be no markups and pro ts so that the
respective terms would be dropped from the second, third, and fourth equation of De nition
1. Similar arguments can be made for other well-known frameworks including Eaton and
Kortum (2002), Krugman (1980) with free entry, and Melitz (2003) with Pareto distributed
productivity draws.
2.1.3

Equilibrium in changes

In principle, it would be possible to take the equilibrium as summarized in De nition 1 to the
data by calibrating the structural parameters fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g as well as the elasticities  s .
However, these structural parameters are hard to recover in practice which makes De nition
1 a challenging starting point for quantitative work. Notice that calibrating js would not
be a problem since it is just an expenditure share: js =

here:

A technique which has come to be known as "exact hat algebra" in the literature circumvents this identi cation problem in an elegant way. It is usually attributed to Dekle et al
(2007) but a version of it is also frequently applied in the traditional computable general equilibrium literature where researchers refer to it as expressing equations in "calibrated share
form".5 I will illustrate this technique step-by-step in the following using the equilibrium
conditions from De nition 1.
The basic idea is to perform a quantitative comparative statics exercise taking some observed equilibrium of the world economy as a starting point. In the application, I will later
focus on a case with 10 regions and 33 industries in the year 2007 but any equilibrium for
which su¢cient data is available will do. The comparative statics exercise can, in principle,
be conducted with respect to any exogenous variable but I will focus on changes in tari¤s and
international side payments and assume that all other exogenous variables from De nition 1
remain unchanged.

Notice that all parameters that enter multiplicatively simply cancel because they take on the
same values before and after the change. This eliminates much of the original complication
because it is then no longer necessary to estimate them.
A slightly extended version of this approach needs to be taken when transforming the other
equations because they also include additive terms. The basic idea is to express these terms
as a weighted sum of proportional changes, where the weights have some factual empirical
counterpart. For example, if the factual and counterfactual equations were x = y + z and
x0 = y 0 + z 0 , one would divide one by the other generating x
^ = xy y^ + xz z^ and transform the
weights

y

and

z

until they can be measured somehow.

This basic idea can be applied directly to the budget constraint from De nition 1. De ning

The last step follows from substituting the gravity equation into the above de nition of

as should be straightforward to verify. Intuitively, this says that price index changes are
expenditure share weighted averages of changes in prices, which in turn are driven by changes
in wages and tari¤s in this environment.
Just like equations (6) - (9) can be used to solve for the equilibrium in levels, equations
(10) - (13) can be used to solve for the equilibrium in changes, which is useful to summarize
in De nition 2:

While the equilibrium formulation in De nition 2 therefore circumvents the need to explicitly estimate fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g, it also ensures that the counterfactual e¤ects of changes
in tari¤s and international transfers can be computed from a reference point which perfectly
matches industry-level trade ows and tari¤s. Essentially, it imposes a restriction on the set
of unknown parameters fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g such that the predicted Xijs perfectly match the

observed Xijs for given  ijs and  s . Recall that
ijs ; ijs ; ijs ;  ijs can all be expressed as

simple functions of Xijs ,  ijs , and  s .

Notice that this procedure does not deliver any estimates of fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g simply
because there are too many degrees of freedom. For example, the iceberg trade costs alone
could be adjusted to perfectly match any pattern of industry-level trade. Of course, this also
means that many di¤erent gravity models could be perfectly matched to the same trade data
using "exact hat algebra" techniques. As a result, there is a real issue of how to discriminate
between di¤erent gravity models, which I discuss more extensively below.6
As should now almost go without saying, the equilibrium for given tari¤ changes could
be summarized in very similar ways in other gravity models. For example, removing the


term 1 1s from the de nition of  ijs is all it takes to instead implement a multi-sector

Armington (1969) model since the markups cancel from the third and fourth equations of
De nition 1 as a result of applying the "exact hat algebra" technique. Of course, small
di¤erences in the equations can cause large di¤erences in the outcomes so that this does not
mean that those di¤erences have to be economically irrelevant.
2.1.4

First-order conditions

The "exact hat algebra" approach is not only a useful tool to calculate counterfactual tari¤
changes but can also be used to go one step further and characterize which of those tari¤
changes is chosen by optimizing governments. I now illustrate this point using optimal tari¤s
as an example but the analysis can be readily extended to Nash tari¤s and cooperative tari¤s.
The idea is to express optimal tari¤s as functions of endogenous elasticities and then use the
structure of the model to solve for them. A special case of this is Gros (1987) well-known

Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2015) discuss in more detail for which trade models this "exact hat algebra"
approach works.

As mentioned above, I abstract from political economy considerations for now and simply

are calculated using the equilibrium conditions from De nition 2.

Optimal tari¤s can therefore be calculated as the solution to a system of linear and nonlinear equations. While I explain below that this approach is not the most e¢cient to actually
calculate optimal tari¤s, I suspect that it could prove useful to study the properties of optimal
tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s theoretically. For example, it might be possible to
formally establish conditions for existence and uniqueness in the spirit of Allen and Arkolakis
(2014) by leveraging existing knowledge about the properties of systems of equations with
these particular functional forms.
Moreover, this formulation might help shed light on the qualitative and quantitative determinants of optimal trade policy. An encouraging start is that it can be reduced to Gros
(1987) well-known version of the classic optimal tari¤ formula in the special case N = 2,
S = 1, and

Calibration
Elasticity estimation

I now discuss two complementary approaches that are widely used to estimate the elasticities
 s . I begin with the traditional approach due to Feenstra (1994) which requires panel data
8

A detailed derivation of this is available from me upon request. It is straightforward but tedious so I will
not reproduce it here.

16

on values and quantities of trade ows. I then turn to the alternative approach suggested by
Caliendo and Parro (2015) which can be implemented in principle using cross-sectional data
on tari¤s and values of trade ows alone. While I illustrate these approaches in the context
a model in which the  s correspond to substitution elasticities, the methods really focus on
estimating trade elasticities, that is the partial elasticities of trade ows with respect to trade
costs. As is well-known, trade elasticities are associated with di¤erent structural parameters
in di¤erent gravity models which should be kept in mind when exploring variations of the
workhorse model emphasized here.
Feenstra (1994)

The approach of Feenstra (1994) is based on an earlier insight of Leamer

(1981) which I now briey summarize: Suppose you have time-series data on prices and
quantities and ask which supply and demand elasticities maximize the likelihood of this data
given that the supply and demand curves have constant elasticity forms. While it is impossible
to uniquely identify these elasticities for standard endogeneity reasons, Leamer (1981) shows
that one can still narrow them down to combinations described by a hyperbolic curve whose
precise shape depends on the variances and covariances of the supply and demand shocks
generating the data.
Feenstras (1994) basic idea is to exploit cross-country variation in the variances and
covariances of these supply and demand shocks to obtain unique estimates of the supply and
demand elasticities. Loosely speaking, a di¤erent Leamer hyperbola can be constructed for
each country and the estimation approach simply determines which elasticity combination
is the best

t for all. The key identifying assumptions are that the supply and demand

elasticities are constant and do not vary across countries and that the supply and demand
shocks are all drawn independently.
This idea is surprisingly easy to implement using a panel of import values and quantities.
The rst step is to use the import data to construct a panel of unit values pist and expenditure
shares

ijst

for a particular importer j and a particular industry s in which there is variation

across exporters i and time t. The de nitions of pist and

ijst

are the same as the ones used

before with the exception that the subscript t is now added to indicate the time dimension
which was absent before. Feenstra (1994) shows that a consistent estimate of  s can then

17

be obtained by applying the following simple procedure assuming that the above identifying
assumptions hold:9

where  denotes time di¤erences and k is

because then the

elasticity formulas would have imaginary values as results. However, Broda and Weinstein
(2006) suggest a grid search approach for this case with which one can still recover estimates
of s and  s . The idea is to simply nd the values of s and  s which minimize the residual
sum of squares of regression (15) subject to the constraints that 0  s < 1 and  s > 1. It
makes use of the theoretical restrictions derived in Feenstra (1994) that 1s =
and 2s =

s
( s 1)2 (1 s )

2s 1
( s 1)(1 s ) .

9

This is based on the explanations in Feenstra (2010), in which the Feenstra (1994) procedure is particularly
clearly explained.
10
To obtain e¢cient estimates of the elasticities, this regression needs to be run a second time using weighted
least squares, where the weights are computed from the inverse of the standard deviation of the residuals from
the unweighted regression. This is done in the STATA code I use to estimate the elasticities for this chapter
which follows the STATA code from Feenstra (2010).

18

As is the case with any estimation procedure, the Feenstra (1994) method is not without
aws. One major drawback is that the assumption of independent supply and demand shocks
is likely to be violated in practice leading to inconsistent estimates. For example, one might
think that productivity and spending simultaneously fall in recessions in which case both the
supply and the demand curves shift in. Another issue is that Feenstras (1994) assumption
of constant export supply elasticities does not apply in standard gravity models such as the
one discussed in this chapter. Strictly speaking, the Feenstra (1994) method is therefore not
correctly speci ed to estimate demand elasticities in such settings but it is frequently applied
to them anyway.
Despite these caveats, the Feenstra (1994) method can deliver plausible estimates of  s .
In particular, Table 1 reports elasticity estimates calculated by applying the STATA code
provided in Feenstra (2010) to Comtrade data for the years 1994-2008.11 In anticipation of
the below application section, they are provided for the 33 industries with which I work later
on. My only departure from the standard procedure is that I pool the data over a number
of major importers.12 This is consistent with my earlier assumption that  s does not vary
across countries and allows me to use a larger dataset leading to more precise estimates. As
can be seen, homogeneous goods such as wheat are estimated to have the highest elasticties.
Also, the mean elasticity is found to be 3.44 which is within the range of estimates from the
literature.
While the Feenstra (1994) method is mostly applied to estimate import demand elasticities,
Broda et al (2008) also make use of the associated export supply elasticities in an interesting
11
The Comtrade data is originally at the SITC-Rev2 4-digit level and I convert it, rst, to the SITC-Rev3
4-digit level using a concordance from the Center for International Data at UC Davis and, second, to the GTAP
sector level using a concordance which I manually constructed with the help of various concordances available
from the GTAP website. This involved combining the original GTAP sectors "raw milk" and "dairy products"
into a new GTAP sector "raw and processed dairy", the original GTAP sectors "paddy rice" and "processed
rice" into a new GTAP sector "raw and processed rice", and the original GTAP sectors "raw and processed
sugar" and "sugar cane, sugar beet" into a new GTAP sector "sugar". This is exactly the same procedure I
follow in Ossa (2014).
12
In particular, I pool over the importers with which I work later on, namely Canada, China, India, Japan,
Korea, Russia, and the US as well as the EU-25 countries Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,
The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom and the
Mercosur countries Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Soderbery (2015) has recently suggested an
interesting extension to the Feenstra (1994) method which deals with a small sample bias found to be present
in the original methodology. While I have not yet applied this methodology myself, I know that my elasticity
estimates look much less plausible if I do not pool across importers which I suspect is exactly due to the fact
that the sample size used for each elasticity estimation is then much reduced.

trade policy application. Focusing on a number of non-WTO member countries, they show
that tari¤s are increasing in the export supply elasticities faced by importing countries just
as the classic optimal tari¤ formula predicts. The focus on non-WTO member countries is
necessary because the export supply elasticities themselves depend on tari¤s under all but the
most restrictive assumptions. As a result, one has to assume that factual tari¤s are equal to
optimal tari¤s for the exercise to make sense, which is more plausible for non-WTO member
countries.
Caliendo and Parro (2015)

Caliendo and Parro (2015) suggest an alternative method

which identi es  s from the e¤ect tari¤ changes have on trade ows. It exploits the particular
structure of gravity equations and can be applied directly to equation (7). In particular,
consider industry s trade ows from country i to country j, from country j to country k, and
from country k to country i and multiply them together as Xijs Xjks Xkis . Now divide this
by the same term just with trade ows of the reverse direction and substitute the gravity
equation (7) to obtain:
Xijs Xjks Xkis

Xjis Xkjs Xiks

(18)

Notice that all terms which are speci c to a particular origin or destination have been
cancelled by taking this ratio so that only pair-speci c tari¤s and iceberg trade costs remain.
The next step is to assume that iceberg trade costs can be decomposed into an origin-speci c,
a destination-speci c, and a pair-speci c component, where the pair-speci c component has a
deterministic and a stochastic part: ijs = #ijs #is #js "ijs . Under the plausible restriction that
the pair-speci c component is symmetric in the sense that #ijs = #jis , the above equation

Just like the Feenstra (1994) method, the Caliendo and Parro (2015) approach is based on
a strong identifying assumption. In particular,

 ijs  jks  kis
 jis  kjs  iks

has to be independent of  ijks (or

its equivalent in changes) for regression (20) to yield consistent estimates. This is violated, for
example, if pair-speci c tari¤ and non-tari¤ barriers are correlated which is likely to be the
case. An additional problem is that all identi cation comes from discriminatory tari¤ barriers
because all MFN tari¤ barriers cancel out. While this does not invalidate the method in any
manner, it is still likely to limit its power in many applications because it eliminates much of
the variation the tari¤ data contain.13
While Caliendo and Parro (2015) have shown that their methodology can be successfully
applied using trade and tari¤ data from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
I was unable to obtain meaningful estimates using a cross-section of trade and tari¤ data
from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) for the year 2007. This is the data I use
in the below application section and it features the tari¤s and trade ows of 10 regions in
33 agricultural and manufacturing industries. Less than half of the estimates were signi cant
and some even had negative signs. Presumably, this is because the included regions comprise
mainly WTO member countries so that there is not enough variation in discriminatory tari¤
barriers.
Discussion

In many ways, the elasticity estimation is the Achilles heel of quantitative

trade policy analyses. Not only is it plagued by serious identi cation problems, but also do
most results critically depend on the elasticity estimates. This will become clear in the below
13

A subtle point that is developed more fully in Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) is that it matters
whether tari¤s are assumed to be imposed before markups or after markups (thereby acting as cost shifters
or demand shifters) in gravity models featuring monopolistic competition and selection e¤ects such as Melitz
(2003). This implies that care must be taken when interpreting the elasticity of trade ows with respect to
tari¤s obtained from Caliendo and Parro (2015) type estimations in such environments. See also Felbermayr
et al (2013) and Felbermayr et al (2015).

21

application section where the elasticity estimates are shown to be important drivers of optimal
tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s as well as their associated welfare e¤ects. Unfortunately, it seems di¢cult to overcome the identi cation problem since convincing instruments
are hard to come by for many countries and industries. The natural alternative is to present
all results for a range of elasticity estimates and then interpret them with the level of caution
they need.
Moreover, the elasticity estimation is often the only time when the model is seriously
confronted with the data because all gravity models can be trivially made to match bilateral
trade ows in levels by choosing appropriate iceberg trade costs. The analysis of Caliendo and
Parro (2015) represents a commendable exception to this rule because the authors actually
try to match the trade growth following NAFTA given the tari¤ cuts NAFTA implied. In
my view, much more work is needed along these lines because di¤erent gravity models have
di¤erent predictions even though they can all match the levels perfectly ne. For example,
multi-sector Krugman (1980) models feature home-market e¤ects whereas multi-sector Eaton
and Kortum (2002) models dont and the quantitative literature so far has little to say about
which one works best.
A more general concern in the same spirit is that most gravity models so far impose very
strong assumptions on the nature of demand elasticities. In particular, demand elasticities
are usually assumed not to vary across countries which amounts to saying that preferences
are the same everywhere. Also, demand elasticities are assumed to be constant which seems
more plausible as a local approximation than as a global property holding along the entire
demand curve. While the rst concern seems to apply to all quantitative trade analyses, the
second one could be particularly important for optimal tari¤ calculations such as the ones
performed here. As will become clear in the below application section, the estimated optimal
tari¤s are rather high in constant elasticity models so that the extrapolation is taken quite
far.14
14

While the methods of Feenstra (1994) and Caliendo and Parro (2014) are commonly used to estimate
trade elasticities, they are by no means the only approaches o¤ered in the literature. For example, Eaton and
Kortum (2002) develop an alternative procedure based on price data which has recently been extended by
Simonovska and Waugh (2014).

22

2.2.2

Trade de cits

Static models like the one used in this chapter really have no compelling way of rationalizing
aggregate trade de cits. As a result, they are usually accounted for in an ad hoc manner
by introducing international transfers such as the ones labelled

i

above.15 E¤ectively, the

assumption is that countries running trade surpluses nance the trade de cits of the other
ones. The mechanics of this can be seen by combining the budget constraint (8) with the
PS
P
requirement that Ei = N
s=1  mis Xmis by de nition. Recalling the shorthand  ijs =
m=1

i

=

S
N X

Xins

n=1 s=1

A common assumption is now to leave the trade de cits unchanged when performing
counterfactuals by imposing

0
i

=

i

for all i. However, this assumption is problematic for

two reasons. First, it implies extreme general equilibrium adjustments for high tari¤s as the
model then tries to reconcile falling trade volumes with constant aggregate trade de cits and
cannot hold at all in the limit as tari¤s approach in nity. Second, it requires a decision in
which units the aggregate trade de cits are to be measured which often seems to be made
unconsciously in the literature by choosing a particular numeraire. To see this, notice that
the budget constraint (8) implies that real income includes a term

is held xed.

In Ossa (2014), I suggest one possible solution to this problem which is to simply eliminate
all aggregate trade de cits before performing any trade policy counterfactuals. In particular,
the idea is to set

0
i

= 0 for all i and use the equations summarized in De nition 2 above to

0
which is free of trade de cits.
calculate a counterfactual matrix of bilateral trade ows Xijs

This is essentially a replication of the exercise performed by Dekle et al (2007) which popularized the "exact hat algebra" approach introduced above. Notice that the abovementioned
measurement problem does not arise in this particular application because all transfers are
set equal to zero anyway.
15

Instead of modeling i as an exogenous transfer of country i, one could also model it as the endogenous
portion of country is income accruing to foreign shareholders who own part of country is economy. This idea
is developed more fully by Caliendo et al (2014) in an economic geography environment.

23

Table 2 summarizes the e¤ects of this procedure using the 10 region, 33 industry, GTAP
data used in the below application section. The rst column lists the aggregate trade de cits in
the raw data calculated as aggregate exports minus aggregate imports as a share of aggregate
export plus aggregate imports. The second and third columns summarize the percentage
changes in the values of exports and imports the model predicts as a result of setting

0
i

=0

for all i. As one would expect, aggregate trade imbalances are large in the raw data so that
exports and imports have to change substantially to eliminate them.
While I work with this purged dataset in the below application section, it seems clear to
me that a better solution to the aggregate trade de cit problem needs to be found. The ideal,
of course, would be to set up a dynamic model which can rationalize aggregate trade de cits
by appealing to intertemporal trade. Such a model would also allow for the possibility to
study how trade policy and aggregate trade imbalances interact. So far, the literature largely
treats aggregate trade imbalances as orthogonal to trade policy and investigating this further
seems like a great opportunity for future work.

Optimization

While solving for optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, or cooperative tari¤s is not a hard problem in
principle, making it feasible in practice has been the main challenge faced by this literature.
To see this, consider the problem of calculating optimal tari¤s in a model with 10 regions
and 33 industries such as the one considered in the below application section. Since each
country can choose a di¤erent tari¤ against each trading partner, solving for one countrys
optimal tari¤s already involves solving an optimization problem with 9*33=297 arguments.
This becomes even more complex when cooperative tari¤s are considered because countries
then have to jointly set 10*9*33=2,970 tari¤s e¢ciently.
In light of this, it is important to carefully choose the numerical approach. In my experience, three strategies have proven particularly e¤ective. First, formulating the problem in
such a way that the number of variables which have to be solved for numerically is minimized.
Second, using an algorithm in the mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints
(MPEC) tradition such as the one recently suggested by Su and Judd (2012). And third, providing the solver with analytical rst-derivatives of the objective functions and the constraints
24

so that they do not have to be repeatedly approximated numerically.
While the second and third point require a more extensive elaboration, the rst point is
much more easily explained. As will become clear shortly, calculating optimal tari¤s, Nash
tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s is best done using the equations summarized in De nition 2.
In this context, minimizing the number of numerically solved variables just means writing
n
o
^i ,w
everything as a system of nonlinear equations in the 2N unknowns E
^i . While this is

already made explicit in the statement of De nition 2, the problem could have been formulated
^ ijs in the list of unknowns which would have
alternatively as one which includes P^is or X
drastically increased the number of numerically solved variables.
Optimal tari¤s To understand the idea behind the MPEC approach, it is useful to begin

by considering a more naive way of formulating the optimal tari¤ problem using the equations
summarized in De nition 2:

This formulation would be implemented in MATLAB following a two-stage approach.
First, one would de ne a function which computes welfare changes as a function of tari¤
changes by solving a system of nonlinear equations, for example using "fsolve". Second, one
would apply an optimization routine to this function calculating the tari¤ changes which
maximize the welfare change for the country in question, for example "fminunc". While this
would work ne in applications with few countries and industries, it would quickly become
ine¢cient for larger scale problems simply because the "fsolve" algorithm would solve the
function with high accuracy for each iteration of the "fminunc" routine.
The MPEC approach circumvents this problem by treating the equilibrium conditions as
constraints. It has recently received much attention in the context of structural estimation
following the work of Su and Judd (2012). Using their logic, it is useful to restate Problem 1
as follows:

This formulation can be implemented in MATLAB using a constrained optimization solver
such as "fmincon". In the MATLAB programs posted on the website accompanying this
chapter, I actually follow Su and Judds (2012) recommendation to use the KNITRO version
of MATLABs "fmincon" for improved speed and accuracy. While Problem 1 and Problem
2 are formally identical, Problem 2 can be solved much more quickly numerically. This is
simply because most solvers do not enforce constraints to be satis ed until the nal iteration
which eliminates much of the abovementioned redundant accuracy.
Most solvers allow the user to manually supply the rst-derivatives of the objective function and the constraints improving speed and accuracy. While this is a relatively tedious
endeavour, it is well worth the e¤ort in my experience because it improves the algorithms
performance in large-scale problems signi cantly. The derivative of the objective function
from Problem 2 is simply a 3N + (N

1)S-by-1 vector with a

1 as its lth element and zeros

everywhere else. Denoting the constraints from Problem 2 by the functions Fi (:), Gi (:), and

Ci  QS P^ is in the list of constraints (instead only the one for i = l). However, this is how I implement it

in the MATLAB code available on the website accompanying this chapter to also calculate the welfare e¤ects
on all other countries right away.

at the counterfactual tari¤s with a similar logic applying to similar

to derive. Of course, it is easy to make mistakes when implementing this in practice especially
since all derivatives also have to be stacked in exactly the right way. However, most solvers
can check user-supplied derivatives numerically so that those mistake are usually relatively
easy to nd.
Figures 1a and 1b display the results of testing the above procedure for calculating optimal
tari¤s in a simple two-country one-industry example using MATLAB programs which are
available on the website accompanying this chapter. The example uses the same data I use
in the below application section but aggregates it to two countries and one industry with
the two countries being Canada and the US. As will become clear later, countries set tari¤s
purely for terms-of-trade motives in the one industry special case of this model so that the
classic optimal tari¤ argument applies. In particular, the terms-of-trade gain outweighs the
distortion loss for small enough tari¤s so that the optimal tari¤ is positive.
Figure 1a plots the welfare e¤ects of unilateral changes in the US tari¤ against Canada
using the equations summarized in De nition 2. It also shows the optimal US tari¤ calculated using the above MPEC procedure as a grey vertical line. As can be seen, the welfare
maximizing US tari¤ indeed coincides with the shown optimal US tari¤ so that the applied
optimization procedure seems to work. Figure 1b repeats this for the optimal Canadian tari¤
yielding the same basic results. Besides providing simple veri cation checks, Figures 1a and
30

1b also reveal interesting economic points which I discuss in more detail later on. In particular, notice that the US optimal tari¤ is larger than the Canadian optimal tari¤ and that the
welfare e¤ects on Canada are always larger than the welfare e¤ects on the US.
Nash tari¤s

Given an e¢cient algorithm to calculate optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s can be

computed relatively straightforwardly. Recall that Nash tari¤s are optimal tari¤s with retaliation, that is the best-response tari¤s one would expect to prevail in a full-blown tari¤ war.
Perroni and Whalley (2000) already report that iteration over optimal tari¤s typically yields
fast convergence to a seemingly unique result. The procedure is to simply impose optimal
tari¤s given factual tari¤s and then reoptimize repeatedly until the best-response equilibrium
is found. Figure 2 illustrates why this works in the simple Canada-US example by plotting
the best-response functions of both countries. As can be seen, the best response functions
are relatively at and have a unique intersection which explains why an iterative algorithm
quickly converges.
While it is obvious that there is a unique Nash equilibrium in Figure 2, this of course
does not necessarily have to extend to cases with many countries and industries. However, I
have been unable to nd multiple Nash equilibria even in more complicated applications when
exploring the implications of choosing di¤erent starting points. A trivial exception to this is
autarky which is a Nash equilibrium in all tari¤ games simply because any countrys unilateral
trade liberalization would not trigger any trade in general equilibrium if all other countries
keep their tari¤s at in nity. Trying to formally prove the conjecture that there is a unique
interior Nash equilibrium would be an interesting objective for future work. One possible
approach would be to explore the formal properties of the rst-order conditions summarized
in De nition 3.
Cooperative tari¤s Calculating cooperative tari¤s is far more challenging than calculating
optimal tari¤s and Nash tari¤s because all countries tari¤s have to be chosen at the same time.
It is also best done by using an MPEC algorithm and supplying analytical rst-derivatives.
As I discuss more extensively in the below application section, cooperative tari¤s are not just
zero for three reasons. First, there is an entire e¢ciency frontier even in perfectly competitive

31

models of which free trade is only one point. Second, governments might use cooperative tari¤s
as a second-best policy to correct existing distortions in imperfectly competitive environments.
And third, political economy pressures might imply that free trade is not e¢cient from the
point of view of governments even though it might be e¢cient from the point of view of the
population as a whole.
Cooperative tari¤s can be calculated by applying a bargaining protocol in the spirit of
symmetric Nash bargaining assuming that countries equally split all e¢ciency gains. This can
be implemented by extending the MPEC formulation of the optimal tari¤ problem summarized
in Problem 2 above. In particular, allowing the optimization to be over all tari¤ changes and
not just the tari¤ changes of country l, assuming that the objective is to maximize the welfare
change of country 1 and not country l, and imposing a fourth set of constraints ensuring
that all countries welfare changes are the same, the bargaining problem can be formulated
as follows:17

As will become clear shortly in the discussion surrounding Figure 3, there is no unique e¢cient tari¤ vector
but instead an entire e¢ciency frontier. While the suggested algorithm identi es the point on the e¢ciency
frontier which ensures that all countries welfare changes are the same, one could alternatively try to identify
the point on the e¢ciency frontier which maximizes the sum of all countries welfares as is often done in the
theoretical
In practice, this would involve maximizing the sum of all countries welfares in changes,

generating this gure are available on the website accompanying this chapter and provide more
details on exactly how this gure is drawn. While cooperative tari¤s are calculated using the
MPEC approach summarized in Problem 3, I have allowed for asymmetric bargaining weights
just for this example to be able to trace out a whole segment of the e¢ciency frontier. Readers
familiar with the theoretical trade policy literature will recognize Figure 3 as a quantitative
example of a familiar illustration of cooperative and noncooperative tari¤s which can be found,
for example, in Bagwell and Staiger (2002).
The curve labelled E is simply the e¢ciency frontier tracing out combinations of Pareto
e¢cient tari¤s obtained by solving a version of Problem 3 with varying bargaining weights.
As can be seen, free trade is on the e¢ciency frontier in the one sector special case of our
model which I discuss in more detail later on. The other curves are iso-welfare loci of the US
and Canada which are solid and dashed, respectively. I have drawn one small pair passing
through free trade and another larger pair passing through the Nash equilibrium tari¤s which
I have labelled N. As one would expect, the smaller ones are tangent to one another at zero
tari¤s whereas the larger ones intersect perpendicularly at Nash tari¤s.

Application

I now put the above tools to work in a more serious application, calculating the optimal tari¤s,
Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s for the 10 largest trading blocks of the world. This is
essentially an extension of my analysis in Ossa (2014) from 7 to 10 regions and is supposed
to highlight some of the main results which have been obtained so far. In the interest of
minimizing replication, I limit my discussion to some key points in this section and refer the
reader to Ossa (2014) for a more comprehensive analysis.

Data

Obtaining the necessary data on trade ows and tari¤s is not as easy as one might think. The
main complication regarding the trade data is to obtain the diagonal elements of the trade
matrix capturing within-country ows especially at the industry level. The main di¢culty
regarding the tari¤ data is to get accurate ad valorem equivalents of speci c tari¤s which
are hard to compute because converting per-unit tari¤s into per-value equivalents requires
price data. In my experience, a particularly convenient source is the Global Trade Analysis
Project (GTAP) database which is available from the Department of Agricultural Economics
at Purdue University. While commonly used for a quantitative general equilibrium model
called the GTAP model, the database can also be downloaded for alternative uses which is
what I did for my application here.
In particular, I work with a 10 region and 33 industry aggregation of the GTAP 8 database
for the year 2007. I include the worlds 9 largest trading blocks and a residual Rest of
the World as well as all available agricultural and manufacturing industries. The GTAP
8 database is itself based on a number of data sources which are carefully cleaned by a
large team of researchers to ensure global consistency. Speci cally, the international trade
data is mainly drawn from the UNs Comtrade database, its domestic trade data is mainly
constructed from national input-output accounts, and the tari¤ data is mainly taken from
the International Trade Centres Market Access Map database. The database is documented
in Narayanan et al (2012) which can be accessed directly from the GTAP website under
https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu.18
While the most recent editions of the GTAP data have to be purchased, earlier versions
are available free of charge. To use the data outside of the GTAP model, one has to follow
a number of steps. First, one has to aggregate the data as needed using a GTAP-supplied
software called "GTAPAgg" which saves the aggregated data as ".har" les. Second, these
".har" les have to be converted into ".csv" les using a GEMPACK program called "har2csv"
18
While the GTAP data is particularly useful in my experience, there are a number of other excellent data sources such as CEPII databases which can be accessed under
http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/bdd.asp and the World Input Output Database which can
be accessed under http://www.wiod.org/new_site/home.htm. Many researchers also make use of the World
Banks Word Integrated Trade Solution available under http://wits.worldbank.org/ and the NBER-UN data
available under http://cid.econ.ucdavis.edu/data/undata/undata.html.

35

which can be executed with a simple batch le. These ".csv" les can then be imported into
MATLAB and used normally. The original GTAP data spans all sectors of the economy. I
simply drop all industries which do not belong to the agricultural or manufacturing sector and
further aggregate a few agricultural sectors to match the Comtrade data used in the elasticity
estimation above.

3.2

Welfare e¤ects

Before considering optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and e¢cient tari¤s, it is useful to illustrate
the welfare e¤ects of tari¤ changes in this environment. This can be done most clearly by
totally di¤erentiating the budget constraint and the price index from De nition 1. Assuming

a countrys export bundle only becomes more expensive relative to its import bundle if its
wage goes up relative to the wages of its trading partners. Notice that this close link between
relative prices and relative wages implies that tari¤s always change the terms-of-trade in all
industries at the same time. It would be interesting to explore setups in which this would
no longer be true for example by allowing for variable markups, changing marginal costs,
multiple mobile factors of production, or input-ouput linkages.
The second term of this decomposition is a "new trade" pro t shifting e¤ect. It captures
that a country bene ts if its pro ts increase on aggregate because of a reallocation of resources
dpis

towards more pro table industries. To see this, notice that d

that industry pro ts equal a share 1s of industry revenues,  is = 1s N

technology (2), and the identity Lis = Mis lis . It can be shown that the pro t shifting e¤ect is

equal to zero if  s =  for all s which makes sense since there is no variation in pro tability
across industries if markups are the same everywhere.
To illustrate this, the upper panel of Table 3 shows the general equilibrium adjustments
following a unilateral increase in the tari¤s protecting the US chemicals or apparel industry
by 50 percentage points. As can be seen, this intervention increases the US wage relative to
other countries and allows the US to expand its protected industry at the expense of its other
industries. Intuitively, a unilateral increase in protection makes imports more expensive for
domestic consumers so that they switch expenditure towards the protected domestic industry.
This then allows the protected US industry to expand which bids up wages and forces the
other industries in the US to contract. These general equilibrium e¤ects are computed using
the equilibrium conditions in changes summarized in De nition 2.
The lower panel of Table 3 then turns to the associated welfare e¤ects. As can be seen,
the US bene ts from the unilateral intervention in the chemicals industry but loses from the
unilateral intervention in the apparel industry. While the terms-of-trade e¤ects are positive in
both cases as a result of the increase in the US relative wage, the pro t shifting e¤ect is positive
if the US protects the chemicals industry but negative if the US protect the apparel industry.
The explanation for this is simply that the chemicals industry is a relatively high pro tability
37

industry because its products have a relatively low elasticity of substitution whereas the
apparel industry is a relatively low pro tability industry because its products have a relatively
low elasticity of substitution, as can be seen from the elasticity estimates in Table 1.
Notice that the pro t shifting e¤ect disappears from decomposition (31) in the special
case of only one industry because then  i =

model is actually isomorphic to an Armington (1969) model (and indeed many other gravity
models) which is just an example of the point made by Arkolakis et al (2012). However,
di¤erent versions of decomposition (31) apply in di¤erent multi-sector gravity models because
the strict isomorphism then breaks down. For example, it can be shown that only the terms-oftrade e¤ect remains in a multi-sector Armington (1969) model. Also, it can be shown that the

3.3

Optimal tari¤s

Figure 4 illustrates the optimal tari¤s of all countries calculated using the methods introduced
above. Recall that optimal tari¤s are de ned as welfare-maximizing tari¤s without retaliation
so that this gure contains 10 separate policy experiments. In particular, each panel focuses on
one country and shows its optimal tari¤s for all trading partners and all industries assuming
that all other countries continue to impose their factual tari¤s. Each dot represents the
optimal tari¤ in one industry against one trading partner and industries are ranked along the
horizontal axis in increasing order of their elasticities. I was able to calculate these optimal
tari¤s in around 15 minutes using a high-end desktop which suggests that the analysis could
be easily extended beyond 10 regions and 33 industries.
As one would expect from the above examples, the optimal tari¤s are positive for all
countries, industries, and trading partners and tend to be lower in higher elasticity industries.
By imposing positive tari¤s, countries improve their relative wages generating positive termsof-trade e¤ects. By tilting tari¤s towards low elasticity industries, they further shift resources
20
In this case, countries would still bene t from a reallocation of resources towards low  s industries but now
because this decreases the aggregate price index. In particular, consumers prefer local varieties to imported
varieties because they are delivered without trade costs. Moreover, this preference is more pronounced for
more di¤erentiated varieties so that consumers would rather have low  s varieties produced nearby.

38

towards more pro table industries generating positive pro t shifting e¤ects. While optimal
tari¤s tend to be lower in higher elasticity industries, the gure also makes clear that this is
not always the case. This simply reects the fact that optimal tari¤s also depend on other
factors such as the industrys trade exposure as the simple two-country one-industry optimal
tari¤ formula discussed earlier already made clear.
Table 4a turns to the welfare e¤ects of these optimal tari¤s always listing the e¤ects on
the tari¤ imposing country as well as the averages of the e¤ects on all other countries. As can
be seen, real income increases by an average 2.4 percent for the tari¤ imposing country and
decreases by an average -0.6 percent elsewhere. Countries can bene t at the expense of other
countries because the terms-of-trade and pro t shifting e¤ects have a beggar-thy-neighbor
character. As can be seen, wages go up in the tari¤ imposing country relative to all other
countries and pro ts go up in the tari¤ imposing country at the other countries expense.
Table 4a also lists the median optimal tari¤s which reveal that the optimal tari¤s tend to be
higher for economically larger countries as one would expect.
Table 4b illustrates that the optimal tari¤s as well as their welfare e¤ects are strongly
decreasing in the average elasticity. In particular, I take the original elasticity estimates from
Table 1 and scale them proportionately to have a mean of 3.5, 5.0, or 6.5. I then redo all
calculations required to construct Table 4a for these scaled values and report the last row
of Table 4a in Table 4b. As can be seen, the average optimal tari¤s more than halves when
using elasticity estimates with mean 6.5 instead of mean 3.5 which simply reects the fact
that countries then have less monopoly power to exploit in world markets. Recall that the
elasticity estimates average to 3.44 in the original calculations which is why the last row of
Table 4a di¤ers slightly from the rst row of Table 4b.
In Ossa (2014), I also explore the case in which governments are politically motivated so
that the welfare weights in the government preferences (3) deviate from 1. Wjs is then de ned
as the welfare of industry s in country j which is just the nominal income accruing to the
associated workers and rms deated by the ideal aggregate price index. The welfare weights
P
js are normalized to satisfy S1 Ss=1 js = 1 so that one dollar of income accruing to industry
s in country j matters js as much to the government as one dollar of income accruing to an

industry which receives average political support. This is meant to capture political economy
39

motives such as the ones emphasized by Grossman and Helpman (1994) in a reduced form
way.
I show that the political economy weights can be calibrated such that the distribution
of optimal tari¤s matches the distribution of noncooperative tari¤s from the data. These
noncooperative tari¤s include tari¤s such as the so-called column-two tari¤s of the US which
are applied to countries with which the US does not have normal trade relations. With the
exception of China, the predicted optimal tari¤s are substantially higher than the measured
noncooperative tari¤s given the baseline elasticity estimates. However, the levels can also
be brought in line much more closely if the higher elasticities from the sensitivity checks are
used. The bottom line is that the average optimal tari¤s and their average welfare e¤ects are
quite similar with and without political economy pressures. This is because political economy
pressures are more about the intranational rather than the international redistribution of
rents.
While the calibrated political economy weights appear highly plausible with the most
favored sectors being wearing apparel, dairy, textiles, beverages and tobacco products, and
wheat, they could also just capture other determinants of trade policy that the underlying
model fails to account for. In order to investigate this possibility further, it would be interesting to relate the calibrated political economy weights to observables such as campaign
contributions which the earlier empirical literature has emphasized (see, for example, Gawande
and Krishna (2003) for an excellent overview).

3.4

Trade wars

Figure 5 illustrates the Nash tari¤s of all countries using the same template as Figure 4. Recall
that Nash tari¤s capture the best-response tari¤s that would prevail in a full-blown tari¤ war
so that Figure 5 now summarizes a single policy experiment. As can be seen from comparing
Figure 4 and Figure 5, the Nash tari¤s are very similar to the optimal tari¤s suggesting
that the best response functions are again relatively at just like in the simple US-Canada
example discussed earlier. Using the optimal tari¤s as a starting point, the iterative algorithm
calculating Nash tari¤s discussed above converges in around 20 minutes on my desktop so that
the analysis could again easily be extended beyond 10 regions and 33 industries.
40

Table 5a summarizes the welfare e¤ects of moving from factual tari¤s to Nash tari¤s. The
real-world analog to this is a breakdown of trade policy cooperation escalating in a full-blown
tari¤ war. As can be seen, all countries lose from the tari¤ war with the average welfare
loss equalling -3.5 percent. The losses are most severe for Canada which is explained by
the fact that Canada is the most open economy in the sample followed by the Rest of the
World, Korea, and Russia who also lose a lot. The losses are least severe for Japan which is
due to Japans ine¢cient factual trade policy. In particular, Japan imposes extreme tari¤s
on agricultural products such as a 237 percent tari¤ on rice so that a move to Nash tari¤s
actually reduces its self-inicted distortions signi cantly.
Table 5b again reports sensitivity checks for proportionately scaled versions of the elasticities. Just like optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s and their welfare e¤ects are also strongly decreasing
in the elasticities, as one would expect from the similarity between the two. I consider mean
elasticities between 3.5 and 6.5 because this corresponds to the range of aggregate trade elasticities suggested by Simonovska and Waugh (2014). This range also captures what most
empirical trade economists would regard as reasonable today so that the average Nash tari¤s
consistent with the model are somewhere between 25 percent and 57 percent. This is broadly
consistent with the tari¤s imposed during the trade war following the Great Depression which
are typically reported to average around 50 percent.

3.5

Trade talks

Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c illustrate the outcomes of e¢cient trade negotiations starting at Nash
tari¤s, factual tari¤s, and free trade, respectively. They are computed by implementing a
bargaining protocol in the spirit of symmetric Nash bargaining just as discussed above. In
particular, I rst simulate the equilibria given Nash tari¤s, factual tari¤s, and free trade and
then solve for the tari¤ change which maximizes country 1s welfare subject to the condition
that all countries gain the same. This is supposed to simulate the outcome of perfect trade
negotiations, that is the best-case scenario of what can be achieved under the WTO. Calculating these cooperative tari¤s is very demanding computationally and takes approximately
one full day per case on my desktop computer.
As can be seen from these

gures, cooperative tari¤s have very similar cross-industry
41

distributions across all three cases but vary with respect to the average levels with which
they apply. The cross-industry distributions reect countries attempts to correct a distortion
originating from the fact that prices are too high in low elasticity industries. The crosscountry distribution reects countries attempt to make implicit side payments ensuring that
the bargaining protocol is satis ed and all countries gain the same. For that reason, the
tari¤ levels vary across the three cases because the three di¤erent benchmarks require three
di¤erent sets of side payments for all e¢ciency gains to be equally spread.
For example, we have seen above that Canada loses most as a result of the tari¤ war
which is why all countries impose high tari¤s against Canada in the case of trade negotiations
starting at Nash tari¤s summarized in Figure 6a. Essentially, Canadas terms-of-trade have
to be su¢ciently bad in equilibrium to ensure that Canada does not gain more than anyone
else. Similarly, Japan faces the highest tari¤s following the trade negotiations starting at
factual tari¤s summarized in Figure 6b because Japan would otherwise gain too much from
dismantling its ine¢cient factual tari¤ regime. Of course, this would look di¤erent if one
explicitly allowed for side payments, which might be more realistic since import subsidies are
rarely seen.
Table 6a lists the welfare bene ts associated with these trade negotiations. As can be seen,
moving from Nash tari¤s to cooperative tari¤s improves each countrys welfare by 3.5 percent
so that this number can be seen as the maximum possible value of the WTO. In contrast,
moving from factual tari¤s to e¢cient tari¤s only improves welfare by 0.4 percent suggesting
that almost 90 percent of all possible welfare gains have already been realized in past trade
negotiations. The nding that trade negotiations starting at free trade would only increase
welfare by 0.1 percent con rms that tari¤s are a poor instrument to address distortions. This
should have been expected from the targeting principle which implies that distortions are best
addressed with the appropriate direct policy instruments.
In Ossa (2014), I also explore the implications of the most-favored nation (MFN) clause
of the WTO which generally prohibits countries from applying discriminatory tari¤s against
other countries. I start by recalculating optimal tari¤s and Nash tari¤s under the restriction of MFN to see if this clause by itself has any bite. I nd that the welfare results are
almost identical to the unrestricted case which also makes sense given the small amount of
42

discrimination shown in Figures 4 and 5. I then consider if trade liberalizations of a group of
insider countries a¤ect nonparticipating outsider countries if the insider countries extend their
concessions to the outsider countries in an MFN fashion. I nd that these MFN tari¤s cuts
would actually overcompensate the outsiders for the trade diversion they experience which
quali es earlier results from Bagwell and Staiger (2005).

3.6

Discussion

If one is willing to take the model as a maintained hypothesis, the above results can be
viewed as providing answers to questions of immediate policy relevance. For example, they
illustrate what would happen if there was a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation
and quantify how much there is to gain from future tari¤ negotiations. If one instead takes a
more cautious approach, they can be interpreted as a plausibility check on some of the leading
models of trade policy making. For example, they show that the Nash tari¤s are of the same
order of magnitude as the tari¤s observed during the trade war following the Great Depression
and highlight that there is enough to gain from trade policy cooperation to plausibly justify
the ordeal of real-world trade negotiations organized by the WTO.
While I believe that the model captures many important forces, I lean towards taking a
cautious interpretation for now, simply because much more can be done to explore the models
validity. One obvious task seems to be to assess how sensitive the results are to alternative
assumptions about the economic environment. For example, it would be interesting to explore
what happens if one introduces intermediate goods and nontraded goods into the analysis
which clearly feature prominently in the real world. Also, it would be fascinating to carefully
confront the quantitative predictions of the model with the trade war following the Great
Depression to see if the highlighted forces are consistent with what has been observed.
With that in mind, it is still insightful to elaborate on what the numbers suggest so
far. In particular, if one combines the welfare e¤ects from Tables 5a and 6a with data on
manufacturing and agricultural value added from 2007, it is straightforward to calculate that
a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation would cost the world approximately $300
billion per year while further tari¤ negotiations could bring about gains of approximately $40
billion per year. So, to the extent that one credits the WTO for preventing the outbreak
43

of trade wars and blames the WTO for failing to promote further trade talks, one has to
conclude that the WTOs track record is quite impressive so far.21

Extensions

In this section, I discuss a number of promising directions in which this literature could be
taken in future work. Overall, the trade policy literature so far is long on theory and short on
quanti cation so that there is an abundance of opportunities for interesting research. I organize my discussion into three main categories, namely alternative models, other trade policy
applications, and applications in other elds. As will become clear shortly, the applications
in other elds I envision also have a trade policy character but answer questions which are
normally associated with other literatures.

4.1

Alternative models

Perhaps the most obvious direction for future work in this area is to analyze optimal tari¤s,
Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s in a range of alternative gravity models applying the
techniques introduced above. The Handbook of International Economics chapter of Costinot
and Rodriguez-Clare (2015) is a great resource for researchers interested in this area because
it provides a comprehensive overview of how the many di¤erent gravity models relate. In fact,
their chapter already includes a short section on the e¤ects of tari¤s in various gravity models
which can serve as an excellent starting point.
An important contribution of such analyses would be to assess the robustness of the
results provided so far. As mentioned earlier, introducing intermediate goods should be a high
priority in my opinion given how central they are to international trade. In the process of
writing this chapter, I have actually experimented with this already but ultimately concluded
that it requires a more thorough treatment than I can o¤er here. One complication is that
intermediate goods introduce a factor market distortion into the Ossa (2014) model giving
rise to a new margin for optimal tari¤s to manipulate. In particular, rms then buy labor
on perfectly competitive markets but intermediate goods on imperfectly competitive markets
21

These calculations refer to 2005 US dollars and are analogous to the ones I performed in a VOX column
which can be accessed under http://www.voxeu.org/article/wto-success-no-trade-agreement-no-trade-war.

44

so that relative intermediate goods prices are too high. While this could turn out to be an
interesting mechanism, it might make more sense to rst characterize optimal tari¤s with
intermediate goods in a perfectly competitive model such as Caliendo and Parros (2015)
extension of Eaton and Kortum (2002).
Another interesting extension would be to relax the exclusive focus on tari¤s and allow for
alternative policy instruments. In my assessment, it would be particularly useful to disentangle
the questions of optimal allocation and implementation by following the primal approach of
the public nance literature. An interesting example of this is the recent analysis by Costinot
et al (2015) who solve for optimal trade policy in a Ricardian trade model. They rst assume
that governments can directly control the resource allocation as social planners and then ask
how their preferred allocations can be implemented with a particular set of policy instruments.
While their paper is predominantly theoretical, they also provide some quanti cations which
would be interesting to expand upon.

4.2

Other trade policy applications

While a quanti cation of optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s is probably a
natural rst application of the above techniques, they could really be used to connect most
branches of the theoretical trade policy literature to the data. As an illustration, let me
focus on the part of the theoretical literature which emphasizes the world trading systems
institutional design. In a nutshell, WTO members are supposed to concentrate all protective
measures into tari¤s, apply these tari¤s on a nondiscriminatory basis, and change these tari¤s
in a reciprocal fashion. Inuenced by Bagwell and Staiger (1999), an extensive literature
has studied the implications of these and other WTO principles and their exceptions for the
e¢ciency of trade negotiations.
Consider rst the principle of nondiscrimination which has the important exception that
WTO members are allowed to enter into preferential trade agreements under some conditions.
This exception is controversial in the theoretical literature for three main reasons. First, there
is a concern that joining preferential trade agreements causes trade diversion which can even
make the parties to the preferential trade agreement worse o¤ (Viner, 1950). Second, there is
a discussion whether preferential trade agreements encourage or discourage further liberaliza45

tions and are therefore building blocks or stumbling blocks on the way to free trade (Bhagwati,
1991). And third, there is an argument that MFN tari¤s protect outsiders to reciprocal trade
liberalizations from any externalities and work in conjunction with the principle of reciprocity
to guide countries to the e¢ciency frontier (Bagwell and Staiger, 1999).
A quantitative analysis could shed some new light on this debate. First of all, the equilibrium conditions in changes summarized in De nition 2 could be used to quantify the extent
of trade diversion real-world trade agreements bring about. My conjecture is that these effects are negligible when focusing on tari¤ changes alone but that they might become more
important when changes in non-tari¤ barriers are also taken into account. Nowadays, many
preferential trade agreements also reduce non-tari¤ barriers as part of some deep integration
process and measuring such reductions convincingly would be the key challenge to overcome.
Moreover, a modi ed version of the optimization procedure summarized in Problem 2 could
be used to assess which preferential trade agreements countries would optimally sign. Besides
speaking to the building blocks versus stumbling blocks debate, this could readdress the
inuential question asked by Baier and Bergstrand (2004) whether the observed proliferation
of preferential trade agreements is consistent with welfare maximization. In this context,
it could also be explored how members of preferential trade agreements would optimally
adjust their external tari¤s thereby assessing the abovementioned Bagwell and Staiger (1999)
argument.
Consider now the principle of reciprocity which is only a norm during phases of trade
liberalization but binds more strictly when retaliatory actions are concerned. In particular,
WTO member countries are authorized to withdraw substantially equivalent concessions if
one of their trading partners reneges on previously made tari¤ commitments. In practice, this
institutionalized threat of retaliation tends to prevent trading partners from reneging in the
rst place and can thus be interpreted as an explicit tit-for-tat rule aimed at ensuring that
trade agreements are self-enforcing.
A quantitative analysis could help determine how much bite this interpretation has. In
particular, the welfare e¤ects associated with optimal tari¤s summarized in Table 4a quantify
the value of unilateral deviations from the status quo. Also, the welfare e¤ects associated
with Nash tari¤s summarized in Table 4b quantify the costs of a breakdown of trade policy
46

cooperation which a unilateral deviation would likely entail. Given a discount factor, one
could now calculate the most cooperative tari¤s which can be sustained in a repeated game
in the spirit of Bagwell and Staiger (1990). In doing so, one could also distinguish between
bilateral and multilateral enforcement mechanisms along the lines of Maggi (1999).
Moreover, it would be interesting to quantify how important it is for the success of trade
negotiations that the principle of reciprocity applies multilaterally instead of bilaterally. As is
discussed more extensively in Bagwell et al (2015) as well as Chapter 8 of this Handbook, one
of the key innovations of the General Agreement on Tari¤s and Trade (GATT) relative to the
earlier US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was to relax the bilateral reciprocity constraint
and replace it with a multilateral one. The basic idea is that it is easier to nd an overall
balance of concessions if it does not have to apply individually for each country pair.

Applications in other elds

While these examples should su¢ce to illustrate that there are many interesting opportunities
for quantitative work within the traditional trade policy literature, it is also easy to think of
closely related applications in other elds. For example, I use similar tools in Ossa (2015)
to study subsidy competition among US states in a quantitative economic geography model.
US states spend substantial resources to subsidize the relocation of rms from other states. I
show that this is consistent with welfare maximization because rm relocations allow states
to bene t at the expense of other states. I also show that observed subsidies are much closer
to cooperative than to noncooperative levels but that the potential costs of an escalation of
subsidy competition are large.
It would be interesting to extend this analysis beyond the domestic US economy and
analyze subsidies o¤ered to attract foreign rms. This could then be tied in again with the
traditional trade policy literature because WTO rules also limit the foreign direct investment
(FDI) policies governments can apply. For example, the Trade Related Investment Measures
(TRIMS) agreement limits the local content requirements which can be imposed on foreignowned rms. Also, FDI ows are increasingly subject to bilateral investment treaties which
would be fascinating to analyze.
Another promising area is climate policy. For example, Nordhaus (forthcoming) argued in
47

his 2015 Presidential Address to the American Economic Association that small tari¤ penalties
could be a powerful tool to entice countries to join climate clubs which impose stricter policies
ghting climate change. His argument is based on the so-called Coalition Dynamic Integrated
Model of Climate and the Economy (C-DICE) which is a quantitative model developed by
Nordhaus and his team. It uses the results from Ossa (2014) to construct a reduced-form
trade bene t function which is needed to quantify the e¤ectiveness of tari¤ penalties.

Notes: "net exports" refers to (exports-imports)/(exports+imports) in
the raw data, Ηȴ exports" refers to the change in exports resulting from
setting aggregate trade deficits equal to zero, and Ηȴ imports" refers to
the change in imports resulting from setting aggregate trade deficits
equal to zero.

Notes: The entries in the upper panel are the wage change of the US normalized such that the average wage change across all
countries equals zero, the change in the quantity of output in the US chemicals or apparel industry, and the average change in the
quantity of output in all other US industries. The entries in the lower panel list the associated welfare effects decomposed into
terms-of-trade and profit shifting effects according to the formula in the main text. The terms-of-trade and profit shifting effects do
not add up to the overall welfare effects because they are computed using a linear approximation.

Notes: The entries under "welfare" are the changes in real income, the entries under "wage" are the
changes in wages normalized such that the average wage change across all countries equals zero,
the entries under "profits" are the changes in profits due to changes in industry output, and the
entries under "tariff" are the optimal tariffs. The columns labelled "own" refer to effects on the tariff
imposing country while the changes labelled "other" refer to the average of the effects on all other
countries. The last row of Table 4a reports averages. Table 4b reports only such averages.
