INTRODUCTION

Household nance studies the ways in which households use nancial instruments to attain their
objectives.

The eld has grown rapidly in recent years, with considerable emphasis on mistakes

household nancial behavior that deviates from the prescriptions of standard nance theory in ways
that are hard to rationalizeand on the characteristics of households and of the nancial systems
in which they operate that either exacerbate or mitigate such mistakes.
This type of research requires high-quality microeconomic data on household nancial decisions,
and the growth of the eld has been driven in part by the increasing availability of such data.
Traditional household surveys have been augmented by administrative data from governments, nancial institutions, and most recently technology companies that aggregate nancial information
for households.

As elsewhere in applied microeconomics, there is also great interest in identication

through discontinuities, natural experiments, and sometimes randomized controlled trials.
A particularly vibrant subeld of household nance studies international data.

One reason to

do this is to exploit the best data that are available anywhere in the world, without presuming
that households behave any dierently in one country versus another.

A second reason is to

measure dierences in nancial behavior across countries, and across regions within countries, and

1

to understand their cultural and institutional determinants.

The rst motivation for international household nance research is powerful because often better
data are available internationally than in the US.

Notably, Scandinavian governments collect data

on the wealth portfolios of their citizens (a prerequisite to the taxation of wealth), and are far more
willing than the US government to merge dierent types of administrative data on households and
to make the combined datasets available to academic researchers.

As another example, electronic

registries of equity ownership are available in countries as dierent as Finland and India, and have
been used for academic research on household behavior in equity markets.
Beyond simple data quality, institutional dierences across countries allow more precise measurement of certain eects of interest.

For example, the mortgage system in Denmark allows renancing

to lower the interest rate even by borrowers with negative home equity and impaired credit records.
Thus, if one observes sluggish renancing in Denmark one can be condent that it is not the result
of renancing constraints that have bedeviled US research on this subject (Andersen et al. 2015).
Similarly, unique features of the UK and Singapore housing markets allow Giglio et al.
to estimate discount rates for real estate over extremely long horizons.

(2015)

Related to this, dierent

countries' and states' nancial systems have dierent regulatory discontinuities, and abrupt legal
changes that occur at dierent times.
provide

Each of these may provide a new natural experiment to

identication.

We note also a third reason for an international perspective: that some important aspects of household nance are

inherently global.

When investing in risky asset markets, households have the opportunity to diversify internationally

but many appear reluctant to do so, a phenomenon known as the home bias puzzle.

Home bias has often been

studied using consolidated national balance sheets (see Cooper et al. 2013 for a survey), but recent work in this area
drills down to the household level (Bekaert et al. 2015).

Even domestic assets such as housing can be aected by

external shocks such as ows of capital and people across state and national borders (Saiz & Wachter 2011, Badarinza
& Ramadorai 2016).

For reasons of space, in this review we devote relatively little attention to this third aspect of

international household nance.

2

For example, Bajo et al. (2014) study a reform of the mortgage system in Italy that unexpectedly removed barriers

to renancing.

Campbell et al. (2015) study discrete regulatory changes in India and trace out their eects on risky

mortgage lending in that country.

Anagol et al.

(2015, 2016) study Indian IPOs in which there are randomized

2

Even in the absence of natural experiments, dierent countries have dierent histories of macroeconomic shocks.

Research on household responses to these shocks can progress more rapidly when

the data available are a multi-country panel rather than a single-country time series.

As an exam-

ple, Badarinza et al. (2015) use international data to shed light on the determinants of xed- versus
adjustable-rate mortgage choice.
The second motivation for international household nance research is explicitly comparative.

At

the level of basic facts it is important to understand which microeconomic facts hold true broadly

3

across the world and which appear specic to the US or to countries with similar characteristics.
Certain patterns across households do appear to be universal.

In all countries households with

higher education, income, and wealth tend to participate more actively in formal nancial markets
and conform more closely to the predictions of standard nance theories.

The eect of age is

also broadly similar across countries, with benecial eects of increasing nancial experience in
early adulthood ultimately overwhelmed by the deleterious eects of declining cognitive capacity
(Agarwal et al. 2009a).
However there are also persistent and somewhat mysterious dierences across countries.

We

explore some of these in Section 2 of this review, using household survey data to compare household balance sheets across 13 developed countries. We document large cross-country dierences in
participation rates (the fraction of households that own a particular type of asset or have a particular type of liability), in the average magnitudes of gross assets and liabilities, and in portfolio
composition (the average share of a household's gross assets held in each asset class, and the average
share of gross liabilities accounted for by each type of debt).

For example, homeownership rates

are particularly high in southern Europe and low in Germany; and both the equity participation
rate and the average share of equities in household assets are larger in Anglo-Saxon countries than
in continental European countries.
An important question is what causes these dierences in household nancial behavior.
possibility is that they result from deep cross-country dierences in culture.

One

Guiso et al. (2008),

for example, claim that trust, a cultural attribute with deep historical roots, determines households' willingness to use the formal nancial system.

The importance of culture is reinforced by

evidence that households moving across borders retain the investment habits of their country of
origin and are slow to adjust to the investment norms of their new home country (Haliassos et al.
2015).

However there is also evidence for the importance of institutions, such as the prevalence of

dened-contribution (DC) or dened-benet (DB) pensions.

In addition, it is possible that histor-

ical experiences, for example with ination volatility, can have long-lasting eects given inertia in
household nance systems.

To the extent that institutions and inertia are important, it may be

possible to identify global best practices that can be imported into countries that have inherited
inferior systems.
The remainder of this review is organized as follows.

Section 2 presents a systematic comparison

of household balance sheets across 13 developed countries, based on household surveys conducted
allocations of shares to particular applicants, and identify a range of treatment eects of randomly experienced gains
and losses on investment decision-making.

Guiso et al. (2002) is a notable early contribution in this spirit.

There is an analogy here to the recent concern

that academic psychology has relied too heavily on experiments with US college students.

The acronym WEIRD

(white, educated, from industrialized, rich democracies) has been used to describe these experimental subjects who
may indeed be unusual in a global context (Henrich et al. 2010).

2 INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE ON HOUSEHOLD BALANCE
SHEETS
In this section we compare simple summary statistics on household balance sheets across countries.
We focus on three types of statistics.

Participation rates give the fraction of households in a country

that own a particular type of asset or liability in any amount.

Mean and median assets, liabilities,

and net worth summarize the overall size of household balance sheets.

Finally, average asset and

liability shares reveal the typical composition of balance sheets.
Accurate measurement of these statistics is a notoriously dicult challenge.

Administrative

data may exist on particular assets and liabilities, but are hard to merge to obtain a complete
picture of the balance sheet.

Household surveys provide a top-down view, but there is increasing

concern about non-response rates either to the survey or to important individual questions (Meyer
et al.

2015), and about inaccurate responses inuenced by imperfect recall, illiquidity of assets

leading to inaccurate valuations, and a tendency to overestimate asset values (Bucks and Pence
2015).

It is particularly dicult to get informative responses from wealthy households, and some

surveys oversample this group (Kennickell 2008).

Recent eorts to improve data quality compare

and combine administrative and survey micro-data, and reconcile these household-level data sources
with national accounts data (Bricker et al. 2015, Cynamon & Fazzari 2015, Koijen et al. 2014).
Cross-country balance sheet comparisons are even more dicult because of cross-country variation in nancial systems, regulations, survey design, and survey response rates.

A relatively new

trend is the development of household surveys that are implemented simultaneously in many countries with questions that are designed to elicit comparable responses.

We use one such survey for

the Eurozone, the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), and several
other national surveys that are broadly comparable to the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) in

4

the US.

Together, these surveys allow us to compare household balance sheets in 13 developed

countries.

4

The SCF, the HFCS, the Canadian Survey of Financial Security (SFS), and the UK Wealth and Assets Survey

(WAS) capture the balance sheets of representative cross-sections. The Australian Household, Income and Labour
Dynamics survey (HILDA) is a longitudinal panel.

These surveys have varying release schedules, so our data span

the years 2008 (Spain), 2009 (Greece, Netherlands and Finland), 2010 (Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Slovenia,
Slovakia and the US), and 2012 (UK and Canada).
stable over time.

Fortunately, participation rates and portfolio shares are quite

Asset holdings and liabilities are measured using current market values.

All surveys use regression-

based imputation methods to correct for non-response, missing or unreliable values, but only the SCF and the HFCS
release multiple replicates.

Participation rates
5

Table 1 reports participation rates in particular assets (Panel A) and liabilities (Panel B).

We distinguish nancial assets from nonnancial assets such as real estate and consumer durables.
Unsurprisingly, at the highest level of aggregation into nancial and nonnancial assets, participation
rates are very high.

In all but one country, for example, over 90% of households report holding

6

nancial assets in some form.

Within nancial assets, the highest participation rate is for bank deposits and transaction ac-

7

counts.

However, the academic literature in household nance has devoted relatively little attention

to simple banking transactions, despite their prevalence and the possibility of household mistakes
in managing payments mechanisms.

Examples of work in this area include Schuh & Stavins (2010)

on the relative convenience, costs, and usage of dierent payment instruments across consumers;
Agarwal & Qian (2014) on the eects of unanticipated income shocks in Singapore on household
spending behavior through bank checking accounts as well as debit and credit cards; and Bakker et
al. (2014) on the large fees incurred by households on account of bank overdrafts.
In most countries, the second highest nancial asset participation rate is for retirement assets
held in dened-contribution pension plans.

This participation rate does vary considerably across

countries, with high levels in Australia, the UK, and Canada, and quite low levels in Slovenia,
Slovakia, and especially Greece.

The main reason for this cross-country variation is that some

countries in the sample rely primarily on DB pensions, which are claims to future income but are
not well measured in the underlying surveys that we rely upon and are not counted as nancial
assets in our analysis.
Outside retirement accounts, there is considerable variation across countries in the participation rates for directly held stocks and mutual funds.

Despite the well known costs and risks of

self-directed active equity investment, and evidence surveyed by Ramadorai (2010) that individual
investors tend to underperform institutions, in several countries (Australia, Spain, France, the UK,
and the US) the participation rate is substantially lower in mutual funds than in directly held stocks.
This is a striking fact even though the mutual fund participation rate excludes mutual funds held
in retirement accounts.
Households' economic exposure to equities can best be summarized by an inclusive equity participation rate that takes account of households' indirect holdings of equities in retirement accounts
and mutual funds as well as their direct equity holdings.

An italicized row of panel A shows

that under this broadest denition, the equity participation rate is just below one half in the US,

8

about one third in Finland, and no more than one quarter in other continental European countries.

5

We dene the participation rate as the fraction of households who report that they hold an asset, even if they

also say that their holding is zero. This is a choice that makes little dierence in most countries but does have an
impact in Italy, where around 10% of households report having a deposit account with zero balance.

6

In Greece, only 74% of households report holding any type of nancial asset.

While this may accurately reect

relatively low participation in nancial markets, it may also reect distrust of ocial surveys in Greece, a country
notorious for tax evasion (Artavanis et al. 2015).

This illustrates the diculties that cultural dierences can cause

for cross-country comparative survey research.

7

The World Bank's Global Financial Inclusion project (DemirgÃ¼Ã§-Kunt & Klapper 2013) reports even more com-

prehensive results.

Using survey data from 148 countries around the world, they show that 50% of adults worldwide

are banked, that is, have an account at a formal nancial institution, but also that account penetration varies across
countries by level of economic development and across income groups within countries.

8

The exclusion of dened-benet pensions from the analysis cannot explain this cross-country variation, since if

DB pension claims were treated as nancial assets they would be bond-like rather than equity-like assets and would

5

As we discuss in section 4, the participation rate increases with wealth in all these countries but
nonparticipants are found even among households with substantial gross assets and net worth.
The participation rate in xed-income products outside retirement accounts is overall relatively
low, albeit with substantial variation across countries. Italy and the UK both have relatively high
participation rates in these products, which include both public debt and long-term debt issued
by banks.

Campbell (2016), using the same underlying survey data for a smaller set of eight

countries, reports consolidated participation rates in all risky assetsboth equities and xed-income
securitiesand nds broadly comparable cross-country patterns to those reported here for equities.
Turning to non-nancial assets, vehicles and valuables are most commonly held.

Perhaps more

importantly, the homeownership rate (measured as the fraction of households owning their main
residence, rather than the more common denition in the real estate literature of the fraction of
housing units that are owner-occupied) is above 50% everywhere except Germany, a country in
which renting is famously more common.
In almost all countries about 10% of households own private businesses.

These tend to be the

wealthiest households so private businesses are a much more important component of the aggregate
household balance sheet than this fraction would indicate.
On the liabilities side, panel B of Table 1 shows substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Three
quarters of households are indebted in the US, and this fraction is only slightly lower in Canada,
Australia, the UK, and the Netherlands.

However, this is very dierent from Italy, where only

one in four households has any debt, or even France, Spain, and Germany, where about half of
all households are indebted.

Given that all countries in our sample are developed industrialized

nations with mature market economies and most of them members of the same currency area, this
degree of cross-country variation may seem surprising. Dierent explanations have been proposed
in the literature, referring to the taxation of mortgage payments, the regional history of nancial
regulation, competitiveness of the banking sector, eciency of the legal system, nancial literacy
of households, and cultural dierences in the social acceptance of indebtedness (Guiso et al. 2006,
Bover et al. 2013).
Countries also dier with respect to the preferred methods of short-term nancing. A substantial
fraction of households hold vehicle, student loans and other debt in all countries, but the participation rates vary considerably, between one eighth in Greece and Slovakia to over one half in Finland.
In Anglo-Saxon countries credit card debt is widespread, ranging from about one quarter in Canada
and the UK to almost 40% in the US. In Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, overdraft facilities
and credit lines are relatively more popular.
Finally, panel B of Table 1 shows wide cross-country variation in the use of mortgage debt.

For

example, only one in ten Italians and one in ve Germans have a mortgage, whereas almost half of
American households do.

This heterogeneity is not explained by the homeownership rate, which

indeed is low in Germany but is close to the US level in Italy.

liabilities.

The rst two rows of panel A report mean and median total household assets in each country.
Large dierences between mean and median assets, notably in the US and Germany, reect an
unequal and right-skewed wealth distribution.

Concentrating on median assets to better reect the

nancial position of an average household, we see the highest values in Australia, Canada, and the
UK, and surprising patterns in Europe where the values are relatively high in southern European
countries such as Spain and Italy, also high in the Netherlands, but strikingly low in Germany.
Even Greece has a higher median household asset value than Germany, despite the large income
discrepancy between these two countries.
In the lower part of Panel A, we compute the average share of each asset category, relative to
total gross assets.

We do this by equally weighting, rather than wealth-weighting, household-level

portfolio shares, again in order to better reect the portfolio of a typical household.
The asset shares help us to interpret the cross-country variation in total asset holdings.

In

Anglo-Saxon countries (Australia, Canada, the UK, and to a lesser degree the US), and in the
Netherlands, retirement assets have a relatively high share.

In these countries, the relatively high

levels of median gross assets are attributable to the importance of DC retirement plans as we
discuss in the next section.

In southern Europe, notably in Greece, Spain, and Italy, housing is

much more important and nancial participation rates are relatively low.

The puzzling observation

that median households in these countries have greater assets than the median German household
is largely attributable to the higher rate of homeownership in southern Europe.
Other interesting facts emerge from this table. Deposits and transaction accounts are surprisingly
important across the sample, and especially so in Europe.
mean asset share in such accounts is 30%.

In the extreme case of Germany, the

While it may be optimal for households with a very small

buer-stock of savings to keep their assets liquid, such a high liquidity ratio seems unlikely to be
optimal for the average household.

On the household demand side, it may well be the case that the

high liquidity ratio reects low nancial literacy, extreme risk aversion, or an irrational preference
for liquidity.

9

On the supply side, some countries may impose regulatory hurdles on nancial

institutions which limit the provision of more advantageous products. It is also possible that protmaximizing nancial institutions consciously direct households towards protable products that pay

10

low interest.

Conrming the evidence of Table 1, mutual funds, bonds, and publicly traded stocks account for
only a tiny fraction of household portfolios, despite historical evidence for an equity premium, and
theoretical exhortations for households to invest in risky assets yielding a positive risk premium.
We discuss this well known puzzle in the section on household risky asset holdings.
Nonnancial assets are relatively important in all countries, but particularly so in southern
Europe as discussed above.

The dominant single asset in all countries is the household's primary

Vehicles and other consumer durables are especially important in the UK, the US, and

Canada, and generally represent the second-largest non-nancial asset category, except in Greece,
Spain, and Finland, where vacation homes and tourism-related residential properties are widespread.

Kaplan, Violante, and Weidner (2014) focus on the other end of the spectrum, namely, wealthy hand-to-mouth

households, who own substantial illiquid assets, but little to no liquid assets. They argue that in the US, this is a
sizeable population whose existence has important implications for macro modeling and scal policy.

Nonnancial assets are often nanced with debt, and panel B of Table 2 describes this side of the
balance sheet.

Median liabilitiesamong households with nonzero liabilitiesare greatest in the

Anglo-Saxon countries and particularly the Netherlands, and are generally lower in southern Europe.
Combining this fact with the asset holdings in panel A of Table 2, and the liability participation
rates shown earlier in Table 1, it follows that median southern European households have higher
net wealth than US or northern European households as shown at the bottom of panel B of Table
2.

This fact, initially surprising given lower incomes in southern Europe, is in part a reection of

nancial underdevelopment in southern Europe, which leads households to save for housing rather
than funding it through mortgage borrowing.
The contrast between northern and southern European balance sheets raises interesting questions
about the relation between private household wealth, shown here, and broader concepts of national
wealth and welfare.

Public housing and other assets used to provide public services enter national

balance sheets but not private balance sheets, and these public assets are likely greater in northern
Europe.

It is also likely that bequest motives are stronger in countries with weak provision of

public services and limited availability of credit to fund educational and housing investments by
young adults.

Finally, it should be kept in mind that a high level of house prices, as in the UK,

raises measured household wealth but corresponds to more expensive housing services rather than
a higher standard of living.
The patterns in household balance sheets we have documented in this section justify the attention
the literature pays to the topics we review in the remainder of this paper, namely, retirement savings,
other risky investments, unsecured household debt, and mortgages.

3 RETIREMENT SAVINGS
Retirement saving is a dicult but extremely important challenge for households, as actions must
be taken far in advance of outcomes, small changes in actions can have large eects on outcomes
because savings are compounded over long horizons, and retired households have few margins for
adjustment if retirement wealth proves inadequate.

Researchers are exploiting micro-level data

on individual retirement accounts and variation in retirement savings systems around the world to
study this important topic.

Overall, researchers have found that households are prone to making

errors in both retirement asset accumulation and decumulation, and that both poor active decision
making and inertia contribute to these errors.
The most basic distinction in retirement systems is that between dened-benet (DB) and
dened-contribution (DC) pensions.

DB systems provide a pre-specied income stream and the

assets that support these promised payments are owned by the pension provider, not by the pension

11

recipient.

If these assets lose their ability to support the promised payments, in principle the

pension provider is liable and the pension recipient is protected, although in practice DB pensions
can be reduced in extreme circumstances.

DC systems allow households to accumulate assets,

through their own contributions and those of their employers, which in turn support consumption
in retirement.

These systems demand more of individual households but also allow greater exibil-

ity to accommodate job changes, periods of part-time work, early retirement, and dierences across

11

Within DB systems, there is also the distinction between funded systems as in the UK and the Netherlands, and

pay-as-you-go systems as in France and Germany.

12

Figure 1 illustrates the cross-country variation in retirement systems.

The gure shows the

fraction of households with DC plans on the left axis, and the average dollar value of the DC account
on the right axis.

The gure shows that following a shift away from DB plans in the last 25 years,

DC pensions dominate the market in Australia, the UK, and the US, but are far less prevalent in
Europe.
The incidence of DC plans has risen in reaction to increased workforce mobility, demographic
changes, pension under-funding, and regulatory reform linked with market-based accounting in these
countries, especially in the UK and in the US, where the size of the average DC pot is considerably
higher than in any of the other countries.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, DC plans have not made signicant inroads into many European countries, where government- and employer-sponsored DB pensions are far more prevalent.
There is considerable heterogeneity across DB pension plans in Europe, and they are often indistinguishable from public social security schemes (Boersch-Supan 2008). Especially in Italy, Spain, and
Eastern Europe, traditional public systems carry the entire burden of retirement nancing, and DC
plans have only very modest participation rates. In Germany, France, and the Netherlands, public
pensions coexist with large DC schemes, which are mostly private and voluntary.

As household

surveys provide very imprecise measures of public pensions and DB plans, we focus in Figure 1 on
the prevalence of DC plans, leaving DB pensions as a residual.
We now turn to summarizing the extensive literature on household choices in the areas of retirement asset accumulation and decumulation.

Retirement asset accumulation
A large body of research has demonstrated that retirement asset accumulation is a mineeld
in which household choices are particularly subject to error.

Benartzi & Thaler (2007) survey

household decision making in this area and show that households make errors of two types.
one hand, many households make poor active decisions.

On the

Notably they adopt naive diversication

strategies that depend on the menu, i.e., the choice of retirement savings options. Households seem
to spread assets across available funds on the menu, regardless of these funds' asset allocation,
an approach that often implies a suboptimal allocation between bonds and stocks.

Households

also engage in trend-following strategies in which their equity allocation moves with recent market
returns, and they overinvest in the stock of companies in which they are employed, especially
following high returns on these stocks (Benartzi 2001).
On the other hand, households appear sluggish in their decision making, in the sense that they
are generally slow to join advantageous plans, and make infrequent changes to their retirement
savings rates and asset allocations.

As we discuss below, practical nudge approaches built on

academic work in this area have attempted to use this household inertia to cure the tendency to
make poor active choices.
Work using a variety of international datasets has conrmed these ndings on inertia as well
as poor active decision making. In Sweden, over 90% of DC plan participants choose the default

plan, and only a tiny percentage of participants make any changes to their portfolio (Cronqvist &
Thaler 2004). In Denmark, only 15% of households are active savers and optimally adjust their
portfolios to respond to retirement-related tax incentives (Chetty et al. 2013). This behavior is not
without consequence: Choi et al. (2011) nd quantitatively important eects of low participation
and contribution rates and suboptimal asset allocation.
Worryingly, these problems appear to be concentrated among those least able to bear the consequences of suboptimal decisions.

For example, Disney et al. (2001) exploit structural changes

induced by pension reform in the UK to show that household responses diered strongly across social
strata, with greater participation by high-income earners. They estimate that half of UK households
do not make sucient contributions towards pension accounts. They also nd that exactly those
parts of the population that do not have any retirement savings and that hold few nancial assets
are the ones that are more likely to opt out both of the state component of the pension scheme and
of plans provided by employers. Similar conclusions have been reached in Canada, Italy, and Germany. Chetty et al. (2013) nd that, in Denmark, active savers are wealthier and more nancially
sophisticated, while passive individuals are least prepared for retirement.
The greater incidence of investment mistakes among poorer and lower-income households may be
explained in part by the lower nancial literacy of these households. Hastings et al. (2013) show that
household nancial literacy is correlated with wealth and income, both within and across countries,
although there is considerable residual variation in nancial literacy.

The literature on nancial

literacy has progressed slowly, plagued by measurement and identication problems. Nevertheless,
international evidence documenting a positive impact of nancial literacy has emerged.

Bucher-

Koenen & Lusardi (2011) exploit the shock of German reunication and use regional variation
across German federal states to obtain exogenous variation in the nancial knowledge of peers.
They nd a positive impact of nancial knowledge on retirement planning.

Lusardi & Mitchell

(2011) conclude that the impact of nancial literacy on planning is also positive in the US, but they
recognize that nancial literacy can be hard to improve given that many households are unfamiliar
with the basic economic concepts needed to make adequate saving and investment decisions.
Recently developed solutions to poor decision making employ household inertia in an innovative
way. Households tend to choose the path of least resistance (Madrian & Shea 2001, Choi et al. 2002),
engaging in passive decision-making and accepting the status quo.

Paradoxically, this provides

the path to a potential solution, since wealth accumulation in DC retirement systems depends on
numerous product-level and institutional design features. Among those that matter are the nancial
incentives households have to participate and contribute (for example matching contributions from
employers); the ease of participation (for example opt-in versus opt-out systems); the presence of
defaults for asset allocation (in the US, for example, defaults used to be riskless money market
funds but since the Pension Protection Act of 2006 have largely become target-date mutual funds
with a mix of equity and xed-income assets); rules concerning early withdrawals (which are often
permitted in the US but much less so in other countries as shown by Beshears et al. 2015); and
requirements for annuitization or withdrawal of assets upon retirement.
To be more specic, households respond to system design features that are economically neutral,
or almost so, which nonetheless reduce the decision-making burden of taking a certain course of
action.

The household nance literature has increasingly taken the view that such nudges can

10

be used to promote advantageous retirement savings strategies.

Evidence has emerged showing

that sensible default options, automatic enrollment, automatic contribution rate increases, fund
matching, and dynamic asset allocations are benecial to households (see, for example, Madrian &
Shea 2001, as well as Hedesstrom et al. 2004 for Sweden, and Lippi 2014 for Italy).
It is tempting to conclude that similar approaches will work elsewhere in household nance, but
it is important to keep in mind that the retirement savings context is special because employees
seem to trust employers to design retirement systems in a benevolent fashion (although Bubb et
al.

2015 question whether this trust is well placed).

In other contexts, households may lack an

institutional counterparty that they regard as benevolent. For example, there is less evidence that
nudges work as well in developing countries.

In Mexico, government nudges were ineective for

households at the lower end of the wealth distribution, and investors did not respond optimally to
the available information, even when signicant eorts were made to make the relevant features
salient, for example by building a synthetic fee index (Duarte & Hastings 2012).

Retirement asset decumulation
How well do households utilize their accumulated savings, once they reach retirement age? A
simple life-cycle model would suggest that older people should run down their nancial assets as
they age.

However, economists both in the US and around the world have been puzzled by the

observation that assets are only slowly decumulated and that the acceptance rate of annuity-type
products is very low (Benartzi et al. 2011).
One plausible explanation for this behavior is a concern about health-care costs, which leads
households to retain assets in case they need to pay for long-term care.

Ameriks et al.

(2011)

survey US Vanguard clients and report that this concern is salient to them. Cross-country evidence
also lends support to this mechanism. Using micro-level data from the U.S. Health and Retirement
Study (HRS), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the Survey of Health, Ageing
and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), Nakajima & Telyukova (2013) nd that the rate of dissaving
in retirement, especially of nancial assets, is correlated with the public provision of healthcare.
Household exposure to out-of-pocket medical spending risk accounts for much of the cross-country
variation in post-retirement asset decumulation, with households dissaving more rapidly in Scandinavian and other countries with high-quality public healthcare.
The role of housing in retirement is also important.

In southern and central-eastern Europe,

the homeownership rate is high and the rate of dissaving is low. In northern Europe, real estate
wealth is less important and retirees spend down their wealth more rapidly. This raises the question
of why homeowners do not extract home equity as they age.

It is possible that housing is used

for bequests, which older people may particularly wish to leave to their young adult children given
the relatively weak public provision of services and the diculty of borrowing in many southern
European countries; but it may also be that home equity extraction is dicult in southern Europe,
where nancial products such as home equity loans and reverse mortgages are uncommon. Even in
the absence of such nancial instruments, retirees could decumulate housing wealth by downsizing,
but such behavior also seems unusual in southern Europe. Angelini et al. (2014) show using SHARE
data that northern Europeans change residence ve to seven times on average, while southern and
eastern Europeans typically move less than three times.

11

In the extreme, elderly households in

Greece, Poland, and the Czech Republic experience only one change of residence on average during
adult life, and no further adjustments in their holdings of residential property during retirement.

4 RISKY INVESTMENTS
A large literature on risky household investments has found that household decisions in this area
deviate considerably from the predictions of theory.

There are two main themes here.

The rst is

participation in risky asset markets: theory is very clear on the desirability of participation, showing
that any rational household should hold at least some equities in a market with a positive equity

13

premium.

The second is ecient portfolio construction: even if households participate in equity

markets, they can easily squander the benets by constructing portfolios with unnecessarily high
risk or low average returns.
The deviation of observed household behavior from the strong theoretical exhortation to participate in risky asset markets is clear. As Tables 1 and 2 show, many households do not participate
in equity markets, and when they do participate, they tend to hold relatively small fractions of
their portfolios in risky form.

This is true even when one takes account of indirect equity holdings

through DC retirement accounts, and Campbell (2016) shows that it is also true when one denes
risky assets more broadly to include long-term xed-income securities.
An important theme of the literature on risky asset holdings is that households with higher
income, greater nancial wealth, and better education tend to invest more in risky assets and also
invest more eciently, i.e., in a more diversied fashion, and paying lower fees.
reasons, such households tend to earn higher average returns.

For both these

Piketty (2014) has expressed concern

that this dispersion in returns increases the inequality of the wealth distribution, a particularly
powerful eect in countries with DC retirement systems and a high ratio of household wealth to
income.
However it would not be accurate to characterize all low-wealth households as non-participants
and high-wealth households as participants.

Participation rates do increase with wealthin unre-

ported results, we nd that the inclusive equity participation rate is between three and eight times
as large for households with greater than median net worth than for households with lower than
median net worthbut the participation rate is quite low even in the upper half of the wealth
distribution, exceeding 50% only in Australia and remaining well below 30% in all other countries
including the US.

14

It is certainly true that non-participation by low-wealth households can easily

be rationalized by small xed costs of risky investment, but it is far harder to explain for wealthy
households.
As mentioned earlier, even among participants, risky shares vary cross-sectionally at given levels
of wealth, and the inecient construction of many household portfolios has been shown to oset
or even negate the benet of stock market participation. For example, many households in Sweden

13

The large historical equity premium has led both nancial planners and academic economists to recommend

substantial equity allocations for households accumulating nancial assets (Campbell & Viceira 2002, Campbell
2006).

14

Wealth is of course endogenous to investment decisions.

Swedish lottery winners.

Briggs et al.

(2015) address this issue by studying

The authors show that close to 40% of Swedes with lottery winnings of over US$ 300,000 do

not begin participating in equity markets following such a large exogenous wealth shock.

Using a calibrated life-cycle

portfolio model, they suggest that a large fraction of the population must have unduly pessimistic expectations about
the equity premium to rationalize this behavior.

12

hold portfolios with a high proportion of uncompensated idiosyncratic risk (Calvet et al. 2007), and
in India, Campbell et al. (2014) show evidence that many household portfolios exhibit negatively
compensated style tilts  for example, holding growth stocks in a market with a value premium,
or by adopting a short-term contrarian investment strategy in a market with momentum where
outperforming stocks continue to outperform for a period of time.
We now discuss what the literature has discovered about the determinants of both non-participation
and inecient portfolio construction.

These determinants fall into several broad categories: wealth,

genetic factors, cognitive ability, nancial literacy, trust, the eects of past experience and reinforcement learning, inertia, and information frictions.

Determinants of risktaking
The cross-sectional variation in risktaking suggests that risk aversion varies across households.
An important question in household nance is the extent to which this variation is endogenous to
wealth.

It is quite plausible that risk aversion declines with wealth, for example if the utility of

bequests or luxury goods is less curved than the utility of basic necessities (Carroll 2002, Wachter
and Yogo 2010).

Calvet & Sodini (2014) use high-quality Swedish administrative data and nd

that risk aversion appears to decline in wealth even when one compares identical twins who have
the same genetic determinants of risk aversion.
Turning to exogenous determinants of risktaking, an intriguing strand of the literature focuses
precisely on these genetic determinants, although research on this subject must be interpreted with
caution on account of the observation that genes may induce predispositions that only develop in
specic environments (Ridley 2003).

By comparing the similarity in nancial behavior across pairs

of identical and fraternal Swedish twins, Barnea et al.

(2010) suggest that genetic factors could

account for about a third of the cross-sectional variation in stock market participation and asset
allocation, although these ndings are disputed by Calvet & Sodini (2014), who attribute this result
to the frequency of communication between twins.

One channel by which genetic factors may

inuence risktaking is through genetic variance in cognitive ability. Grinblatt et al. (2011) use data
from Finland, where IQ scores are available for all Finnish males in a 20-year age range because
they are obtained upon induction into Finland's mandatory military service. They show that scores
on IQ tests predict stock market participation, as well as trading behavior and performance.
Numerous studies measure nancial literacy and show that it correlates with risktaking.
Rooij et al.

Van

(2011) survey households in the Netherlands and nd that low-literacy households

are less likely to participate in the stock market.

Christiansen et al. (2008) show, using Danish

data, that economists are far more likely to participate in the stock market than other comparable
investors suggesting that specic nancial education may also be an important determinant.

A

diculty in interpreting these studies is that nancial literacy is endogenous; wealthier people, and
people with greater risk tolerance and hence greater interest in risky asset markets, may choose to
become nancially literate.
Guiso et al. (2008) emphasize that trust in formal nancial institutions and systems is a prerequisite for equity investing, and present evidence that countries and regions with low levels of trust
also tend to have low levels of stock market participation.

Overall, international studies conrm

that less trusting individuals are less likely to buy stocks and, conditional on buying stocks, buy

13

less.

Trust, which is dicult to measure, may be correlated with other observable attributes.

For

example, religious households consider themselves more trusting, and are more likely to save, and
left-wing voters and politicians are less likely to invest in stocks, controlling for income, wealth, education, and other relevant factors, a nding that may be explained by greater faith in the market
among right-wing voters (see Kaustia & Torstila 2011).
A growing literature studies the relation between past experiences and risktaking.

One strand

of this literature relates personal economic experiences to long run risk-taking in nancial markets,
nding that investors living through periods of low stock returns, ination, and unemployment
suer declines in stock market participation and allocations to risky assets even decades after the
experience. Malmendier & Nagel (2011) nd, using data from the US, that stock returns experienced
during an investor's lifetime predict participation and risktaking, and suggest that the mechanism
is a tendency for households to overweight events they have experienced directly when they forecast
asset returns.

The international literature has also documented similar links between experiences

early in life and subsequent portfolio decisions, showing that stock market downturns in particular
have signicant and economically substantial eects on households' willingness to take nancial
risks.
On the other hand, time-series variation in risktaking may also partially result from inertia.

If

a household rarely reviews its portfolio risk, and allows this to drift passively with market returns,
the household's risky share will tend to increase with stock prices.

Calvet et al. (2009) use Swedish

administrative data and nd evidence for partial but not complete inertia.
Finally, information frictions may be an important part of the story. Hong et al. (2004), for
example, use data from the Health and Retirement Study in the US, and nd that social households,
who interact with their neighbors, or attend church, are more likely to invest in the stock market.
Kaustia & KnÃ¼pfer (2012) show that in Finland, recent stock returns that local peers experience
aect an individual's stock market entry decision, although the result is not symmetric in the sense
that negative returns don't seem to aect exit from the market.

They attribute this result to

households not discussing negative experiences with others as often as they do positive outcomes,
although the usual caveats about work on peer eects about unobservable common determinants
apply here (Angrist, 2014).

Underdiversication, income hedging, and local bias
Household portfolio returns are inuenced not only by the overall level of risk taken, but also
by the eciency of diversication.

An underdiversied portfolio has higher risk for any average

return, because it takes uncompensated idiosyncratic risk.
or Sharpe ratio, is lower.

Hence its average return per unit risk,

Calvet et al. (2007) study non-retirement portfolios in Sweden, a country

where mutual funds play an important role, and nd that the median Swedish household obtains
a Sharpe ratio about 85% that of a world equity index (invested without currency hedging), but
the corresponding number for a household at the fth percentile of eciency is only 40%.

These

numbers translate into average return losses on risky investments, relative to the ecient benchmark,
of 87 basis points for the median household and over 7% for a household at the fth percentile of
eciency.

The return losses are only about one-third as large on complete household portfolios,

because the share of risky assets is on average only about one-third.

14

The results of Calvet et al. are based on unusually comprehensive wealth data, but some of their
ndings appear consistent with data from other countries.

For example, Calvet et al. calculate

the fraction of the total variance of each household's risky portfolio that is due to idiosyncratic
risk, and nd this to be about 55% for the median Swedish household that invests in risky assets.
Comparable ratios are reported within portfolios of directly held stocks studied by Grinblatt &
Keloharju (2000) in Finland, Von Gaudecker (2015) in the Netherlands, and Campbell et al. (2014)
in India.

In India, directly held stocks constitute the principal investment in risky assets for a

majority of households.
One justication for underdiversication could be to hedge the risks of labor income that households receive, or other risks such as future health risk.

Since wages and stock returns generally

move together at the industry level, income hedging would require households to invest in industries
other than the one they work for.

In fact, households typically anti-hedge by overinvesting in

their own industry and even their own employer as shown by Benartzi (2001), Massa & Simonov
(2006) and others.
Alternatively, underdiversication might be justied if households have superior information
about local stocks in the industry they work for or the region where they live.

Such information

could lead households to actively overweight or underweight local stocks, and could create an unconditional average tilt towards local stocks if information reduces the risk of holding these stocks
or if households face short-sales constraints.

Theoretically, even a small initial local informational

advantage may be magnied into signicant home bias, as investors rationally choose to expand
their knowledge in the domain in which their information advantage initially lies.

In this vein,

Massa & Simonov (2006) attribute the observed anti-hedging behavior of Swedish households to
superior information they may have about the industries in which they are employed, and Bernile
et al. (2015) suggest that US investors earn greater returns on stocks with greater local economic
exposure. However, DÃ¸skeland & Hvide (2011), using Norwegian data, nd no evidence for superior
performance of anti-hedging investments.
Perceptions of familiarity rather than true informational asymmetry may also play a role here.
For example, Grinblatt & Keloharju (2001) nd that Finnish households are more likely to hold and
trade stocks of rms located nearby, rms where the CEO is from a similar cultural background to
themselves, and rms that communicate in their native tongue. They also nd that these eects
are more pronounced for not-for-prot, government, and household investors than for prot-making
corporations.
Both the degree of underdiversication and the reasons for it may vary with the household's
level of nancial sophistication.

Von Gaudecker (2015) nds that Dutch households with lower

nancial literacy are less well diversied unless they seek advice from professional advisers or personal
contacts. Guiso & Viviano (2015) also relate diversication to nancial literacy using administrative
data from Italy. Korniotis & Kumar (2013), using data from 11 European countries and the US, show
that households with demographic characteristics suggestive of sophistication tend to outperform
if they hold concentrated portfolios, but the opposite is true for households that are likely to be
unsophisticated.
Finally, there is some evidence for life-cycle eects on portfolio construction. For example, Betermier et al. (2016) examine the tendency of Swedish investors to hold value stocks (comparatively

15

cheap stocks with high book-market ratios), relative to growth stocks (comparatively expensive
stocks with low book-market ratios). They nd a tendency for young investors to overweight growth
stocks while older investors overweight value stocks.

This tendency is particularly strong among

investors employed in cyclical industries. They suggest that this life-cycle eect on the value tilt
is consistent with models in which value stocks have the same risk exposures as young investors'
human capital, while growth stocks hedge these risks.

Trading behavior
Households can squander some of the benets of stock market participation if their short-term
decision making is sub-optimal.

This behavior was originally highlighted in the work of Barber

& Odean (2000) on the high turnover of US households' portfolios unaccompanied by increases in
expected returns, suggesting that households incur unnecessarily high transactions costs. Moreover,
as Grinblatt & Keloharju (2001) show, households tend to exhibit a strong disposition eect, i.e.,
the tendency to hold one's losing investments while selling winners, a losing strategy in a market
with positive momentum, and a sub-optimal one in countries in which losses can shield capital gains
from taxes.
The literature has highlighted similar causes for biases in short-term decision making as it has
for longer-term risktaking behavior. For example, Cronqvist & Siegel (2014), using twins data from
Sweden, show that genetic factors have strong explanatory power for behavioral biases in equity
markets, including underdiversication and the disposition eect. Intriguingly, Chen et al. (2006)
show that capuchin monkeys appear to exhibit loss aversion, suggesting that such behavior has deep
evolutionary roots.

IQ also appears to aect short-term equity trading behavior.

Grinblatt et

al. (2012) nd that, in Finland, high-IQ investors are less subject to the disposition eect, more
aggressive about tax-loss trading, and more likely to supply liquidity when stocks experience a onemonth high. High-IQ investors also exhibit superior market timing, stock-picking skill, and trade
execution.
Learning and feedback also seem to play a role in short-term nancial decision-making. Several
papers, including Korniotis & Kumar (2011) and Campbell et al.

(2014), show that style tilts,

trading intensity, and the disposition eect are related to time in the market, feedback from investment performance, and investors' demographic characteristics suggesting the role of experience and
sophistication.

Feng & Seasholes (2005), tracking the behavior of Chinese investors through time,

show that sophistication and trading experience eliminate the reluctance to realize losses, but only
moderately reduce the propensity to realize gains.
The international household nance literature has studied the eects of trading performance
on trading intensity using datasets from dierent countries, converging on the view that good performance predicts trading intensity.

This suggests a model in which investors learn from their

performance about their trading skill, and they cease trading if they conclude that they lack skill
(see, for example, Linnainmaa 2011, who uses data from Finland).

However, others propose that

the eects of performance on trading may stem from more naive reinforcement learning, or from
the fact that investors may have non-classical utility functions such as reference-dependent preferences with loss aversion. For example, Anagol et al. (2015, 2016) use lotteries in oversubscribed
IPOs in India to show that lottery-winning investors, who receive exogenous gains (from which no

16

inferences about investor skill can be made) on account of being randomly allotted IPO shares, are
more inclined to hold the shares that they won for long periods of time despite incurring substantial
losses on them, likelier to apply for future IPOs, increase the fraction of their portfolios held in
the same sector as the IPO stock, increase the overall number of stocks that they hold, and churn
their portfolios far more frequently.

Anagol et al. detect these eects on investment behavior even

among investors with substantial portfolio holdings, for whom the exogenous gains are small enough
fractions of the portfolio to rule out explanations based on wealth eects or portfolio rebalancing.

Delegated investing, fees, and complexity
Households can control suboptimal investment behaviors in several ways.

One possibility is for

households to hold mutual funds as a way to gain equity exposure without trading stocks directly.
Another possibility is for households to seek professional advice on their investment decisions (Von
Gaudecker 2015).

In both of these cases, however, there may be important trade-os between

households' tendencies to engage in these behaviors, the level of fees charged by advisers and mutual
funds, the incentives of advisers to oer objective advice, and the possibility that mutual fund
managers or advisers may themselves be susceptible to these behaviors.
Fees are perhaps the most obvious example of costs imposed on households through delegation
to mutual funds.

Khorana et al.

(2009) show that mutual fund fees vary considerably around

the world, and that the quality of a country's governance environment is negatively correlated with
the level of fees charged to customers.

Anagol & Kim (2012) estimate, using a natural experiment

in India in which regulatory actions dierentiated the fees that could be charged by closed- and
open-ended mutual funds, that investors lost and fund rms gained approximately $350 million US
as a result of the shrouded fees that could be charged by closed-end funds. On the demand side,
Grinblatt et al. (2015) show that high-IQ investors in Finland avoid mutual funds with high fees.
Visible fees are not the only way in which institutional asset managers are able to extract rents
from retail investors.

Structured products, which oer payos that are nonlinear and often complex

functions of asset returns, are a common household investment vehicle in Europe.

CÃ©lÃ©rier & VallÃ©e

(2014) conduct a textual analysis of the term sheets of 55,000 retail structured products issued in
17 European countries during the 2000s. They nd that the complexity of these products increased
signicantly over the decade, that relatively more complex products have higher markups, and that
the headline rate oered by a product (the return made salient to investors through marketing)
is an increasing function of its complexity.

These results cast serious doubt on the suitability of

structured products for unsophisticated investors.
Financial advice is another area in which households face signicant challenges. Foerster et al.
(2014), using comprehensive data from Canada, show that nancial advisers oer one-size-ts-all
advice that appears better explained by adviser attributes than household characteristics.

This

advice appears to cost roughly 2.7% per year, signicantly more than the cost of a life-cycle fund.
While nancial advisers may help their clients by giving them the courage to invest in risky assets,
as suggested by Gennaioli et al.

(2015), these results raise the question of whether a lower-cost

solution can be made available.

UNSECURED CREDIT

The main forms of unsecured credit in most countries are credit cards, overdrafts, and high-cost
short-term credit commonly known as payday loans.

The literature has analyzed the nature of

borrowers and their repayment behavior, the structure of markets and products, the pricing of
credit in these markets, and the behavior of households following bankruptcy (see Zinman (2015)
for a recent survey).

The literature seeks to understand not only consumer mistakes in using credit,

but also the incentives to supply complex nancial products that exploit these mistakes.

We survey

research on dierent types of unsecured credit, and conclude with a brief summary of work on one
potential outcome of consumer borrowing, personal bankruptcy. The literature on this subject seeks
to understand the principal determinants of personal bankruptcy, and considers the optimal design
of bankruptcy regulation.

Credit cards and overdraft accounts
Credit cards and overdraft accounts are convenient and ubiquitous, but often criticized for confusing marketing and misleading back-end fees.
In the UK, teaser rates on credit cards are omnipresent.

These often take the form of zero

interest rate deals, provided to households as an incentive to switch credit card providers, for a
limited period during which APRs on cards are eliminated. Once the initial teaser period elapses,
households can hit a payment wall which can result in signicant nancial vulnerabilities, as banks
re-adjust rates to more normal APRs.

May et al. (2004), using survey data from the UK, nd that

many households take such deals, and estimate signicant costs to households who do not switch
following the teaser period.

Recently in the UK, the Royal Bank of Scotland unilaterally announced

that it is eliminating such deals from its set of consumer oers, claiming that their internal research
found evidence that the fees paid by consumers on these deals were close to extortionate.
Gabaix & Laibson (2006) provide a useful theoretical framework which has often been used to
study the consumer credit market.

They suggest that a shrouded equilibrium is one in which

sophisticated consumers benet at the expense of unsophisticated consumers in an environment
in which producers oer complex multi-attribute products.

The sophisticated unbundle the

products, eschewing the expensive options, and the price that they eventually pay is lower since
unsophisticated consumers cross-subsidize them by consuming these unnecessary frills. Producers
do not have an incentive to deviate by oering simpler products, since such oers simply educate
more consumers, causing these new sophisticates to move to the complex product.
In the US, the CARD Act of 2009 regulated the practices of personal credit card issuers in a way
that appears to have been successful at reducing their ability to earn unusually high fees.

Agarwal

et al. (2015) use small-business credit cards as a control group (since they were not regulated by
the CARD Act) and nd that explicit fees did not go up even though the collection of back-end fees
was regulated.

This suggests that credit card issuers have some market power and took a hit to

their prots following the regulation - which does not match the implications of a simple competitive
version of the shrouded equilibrium model, although it is consistent with a more complex imperfectcompetition framework.
An active area of research has explored the determinants of households' repayment behavior.

In

the US, Gross & Souleles (2002) pioneered the use of large loan-level datasets to study credit card

18

payment ows. They estimate duration models of default on credit card balances, and use variation
in default costs (which can be both pecuniary costs such as legal fees, as well as nonpecuniary costs
such as social stigma) to explain changes in borrowers' willingness to default.
Features of the market can also inuence repayment behavior. Campbell et al. (2012) use data
from a payment solutions company and exploit variation across US counties to study bank account
closures resulting from excessive overdraft activity.

They nd that involuntary closures relate to

the competitiveness of the banking sector, with more closures in counties with more competitive
banking markets and more multi-market banks. As with many other studies in household nance,
they also nd that high involuntary closures are associated with low levels of education and wealth.
In this area of household nance as in others, reinforcement learning is an important theme.
Agarwal et al. (2013a) nd that households learn how best to reduce fees on their credit card bills,
and estimate that this knowledge depreciates by roughly 10% per month, i.e., they nd evidence that
households learn and subsequently forget.
accounts.

Bakker et al.

Similar patterns hold for borrowers who use overdraft

(2014) use supervisory transaction-level data from the US to study the

life cycle of overdraft usage. They conclude that borrowers become inattentive after the rst year,
ignoring increases of fees.
Finally, the form of the institution providing consumer credit may be important.
credit normally requires an ongoing relationship with a nancial institution.
force that inhibits the formation of such a relationship.

Cheaper

Mistrust may be one

Mutual and nonprot institutions, such

as mutual insurance companies, credit unions, and traditional UK building societies, may help to
address this problem (Bubb & Kaufman 2013), with the caveat that mutuals can easily be captured
by their management since depositors do not provide eective oversight. Wheelock & Wilson (2011),
using US data, document a rapid increase in the share of credit unions as a share of US depository
institution assets, and present evidence that they exhibit increasing returns to scalesuggesting
that this may be an important growth sector in the future.

Payday loans, pawn loans, and payroll loans
Payday loansextremely short-term credit products often bearing high annual percentage rates
(APRs)can be an attractive alternative means of borrowing, particularly for households who lack
access to credit cards and overdrafts. However, this particular form of credit has been controversial.
Critics claim that these loans are potentially exploitative because borrowers may repeatedly renew
their loans and enter a debt trap, whereas defenders point out that consumers without a savings
buer-stock can use these markets to avoid worse outcomes such as eviction for non-payment of
rent, or loss of work when a car breaks down (Agarwal et al. 2009b, Stegman 2007, Campbell et al.
2011).

The literature on payday loans and other small-ticket short-duration credit also has links

with the microcredit literature in developing countries (for a survey, see Banerjee et al. 2015).
International research has been particularly fertile in this area. For example, Berry & Duncan
(2007) use data from the Canadian Survey of Financial Security to show that having access to
payday loans allows people to meet nancial emergencies more easily, while at the same time payday
borrowers are more likely to become insolvent. Some papers, e.g. Carrell & Zinman (2014), exploit
variation in payday loan regulations across US states to identify the eects of access to payday loans
on nancial outcomes. They draw upon exogenous variation in the assignment of military personnel

19

to domestic bases, as well as the fact that US states have eective regulatory authority over such
loans. They nd that access to payday loans leads to a signicant decline in job performance and a
higher likelihood of nancial distress.
More recently, the literature has tried to understand the exact mechanism through which payday
loan indebtedness generates problems for borrowers.

Skiba & Tobacman (2011) explore whether

households who borrow simply view payday loans as a solution to their immediate cashow difculties without adequately accounting for the additional interest burden they impose, and nd
evidence to support this conjecture using administrative loan-level data.

They exploit a regression

discontinuity design using the applicants' credit scores, to show that payday loans causally and
substantially increase overall personal bankruptcy rates.

This echoes the nding of Campbell et al.

(2012), who nd that access to payday lending is associated with involuntary bank account closure.
Signicant regulation has been imposed on payday lending around the world.

In the UK, the

Financial Conduct Authority has recently exercised its mandate to impose a payday lending rate
cap, explicitly citing rollover lending, punishing repayment schedules, and default fees as factors
resulting in debt traps for low income households.

Such caps also exist in Canada.

In the US,

fteen states have banned payday lending altogether.
Zinman (2010) suggests that imposing such restrictions on borrowing may not be eective at
averting the negative consequences of payday loans.
shows that borrowing restrictions have

negative

He uses cross-state variation in the US, and

consequences on the overall household nancial

situation. Households appear to simply substitute one product with another, often opting for even
worse terms than those initially oered by payday lenders.
Evidence from developing countries also serves to challenge the negative view on payday loans.
Karlan & Zinman (2010) use a randomized control trial in South Africa and question the popular
presumption that vulnerable consumers over-borrow in the expensive consumer credit markets. They
document signicant net benets for households, which can mostly be attributed to a relaxation
of binding borrowing constraints.
employer-provided payday loans.

In emerging markets, payroll loans are a widespread form of
In Brazil, they are essentially personal loans with principal and

interest payments directly deducted from the borrower's payroll check. Costa & de Mello (2008)
exploit the fact that a high-level federal Brazilian court upheld a regional ruling that had declared
employer-based payment deduction illegal. Using personal loans without payment deduction as a
control group, they nd that payroll loans help to decrease overall borrowing costs.
The contrast in these results for developed and developing countries shows the potential of the
international comparative approach. It suggests the hypothesis that in the early stages of economic
development, when access to nancial products is limited, documentation scarce, and monitoring
costly, short-term high-cost credit may temporarily ease the nancial burden on households and
help them to avoid unemployment and long-term health problems. On the other hand, in developed
countries, less nancially sophisticated and uneducated people self-select into more expensive forms
of credit, which can easily push them into nancial and economic distress.

More research is needed

to test this hypothesis more carefully and to evaluate the eects of payday lending regulation.
The literature nds a clear connection between the life stage (young, single parent), nancial position (low-income), employment situation (fragile) and the propensity to take short-term consumer
credit (Autio et al.

2009). Interestingly, this also holds for retail sales debt.

20

Vissing-Jorgensen

(2011) uses transaction-level data from Mexico to show that dierent product categories are associated with dierent likelihood of default.

She attributes these eects to variation in the type

of individuals who buy certain products, suggesting that the purchase of luxury goods on credit
is a sign of conspicuous consumption or lack of self-control.

Using data from Sweden, Bos et al.

(2012) nd that pawn shop borrowers are more often female, experience instability in both their
job and marital status, more likely to be divorced or separated, less likely to own a home, more
likely to have bad credit scores, and often have exhausted their outstanding lines of credit. Lusardi
& DeBassa-Scheresberg (2013) survey US households to understand the prevalence of a number of
forms of unsecured credit, including payday loans, pawn shops, auto title loans, refund anticipation
loans, and rent-to-own shops.

They nd that roughly one in four Americans had used these types

of credit in the previous ve years, and that most borrowers were young adults with low levels of
nancial literacy.

Personal bankruptcy
Households' mistakes and poor management of unanticipated expenditures can lead to declarations of personal bankruptcyitself an important area of investigation. The literature has concentrated on understanding the principal determinants of personal bankruptcy, as well as the optimal
design of bankruptcy regulation, an important institution in household nance.
Health shocks appear to be an important determinant of bankruptcy.

Gross & Notowidigdo

(2011) use cross-state variation in Medicaid expansions to show that an increase in Medicaid eligibility reduces the personal bankruptcy rate. Out-of-pocket medical expenses are shown to cause
about a quarter of personal bankruptcies among low-income households.

Duygan-Bump & Grant

(2009) nd, using cross-country data from Europe, that bankruptcy declaration is typically associated with an unexpected (often health) shock.
Several studies have undertaken simple cross-country or cross-state analysis to understand the
features of the regulatory environment that are associated with high bankruptcy rates.

Unsur-

prisingly to an economist, these studies nd that formal bankruptcy is more prevalent when this
procedure is cheap and easy, and when the alternative of informal default is costly and dicult.
(See for example Duygan-Bump & Grant (2009) who use European data and Lefgren & McIntyre
(2009) who use US data.)

There is also research on how debtor protections, both in bankruptcy

and in mortgage foreclosure, aect the willingness of lenders to extend credit.

Gropp et al. (1997)

and Pence (2006) nd that state-level debtor protections reduce the availability of auto loans and
the size of mortgages, respectively.
More structural models have also been used to understand the eects of debtor protections.
For example, Mitman (2015) calibrates a model to t cross-state variation in mortgage recourse
provisions as well as bankruptcy laws, and to understand the eect of US bankruptcy reform in
2005.

Consistent with the empirical literature discussed above, Mitman nds that reduced access

to bankruptcy after 2005 initially reduced bankruptcy rates; but he also nds that it inadvertently
increased foreclosure rates. Dobbie & Goldsmith-Pinkham (2015) present related empirical work,
focusing on consumer deleveraging in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
Finally, some recent work has looked at the welfare eects of bankruptcy for households, using
approaches for causal identication.

For example, Dobbie & Song (2015) use administrative tax

21

data and exploit the random assignment of bankruptcy lings to judges to study post-bankruptcy
outcomes. They nd that after declarations of personal bankruptcy, annual earnings are relatively
higher, mortality decreases, and subsequent foreclosure rates are lower.

6 MORTGAGES
Mortgages epitomize the promise and the challenge of international comparative household nance.
Mortgages are of rst-order importance in every country, as shown in Tables 1 and 2.
the natural result of three facts:

This is

housing is the most important asset of the household sector;

the indivisibility of houses and high costs of moving make it desirable to nance home ownership
through debt; and houses provide good-quality collateral for secured borrowing.

The literature in

this area has focused on household decisions in all phases of the mortgage lifecycle  from the choice
of mortgage contract, to the decision to renance the mortgage, and nally on the determinants of
mortgage default.

These are all complex decisions, and as with other areas of household nance,

the literature has explored the roles of reinforcement learning and inertia in explaining households'
observed choices, which often appear to deviate widely from the prescriptions of nance theory.
While mortgages are extremely important in all countries, the details of the mortgage system
vary widely across countries, as reviewed in Campbell (2013) and illustrated in Table 3. The table
shows that the US and Germany rely primarily on xed-rate mortgages (FRMs), while Australia,
Ireland, the UK, and southern European countries have almost exclusively adjustable-rate mortgages
(ARMs).

Some other countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden, show

considerable variation in the ARM share over time.

FRMs in Germany cannot be renanced

without compensating the lender for any change in interest rates since mortgage issuance, while
the US system allows renancing provided the borrower has suciently positive home equity and
good credit standing, and the Danish system provides an absolute right to non-cash-out renancing
(Andersen et al.

2015).

Some US states have non-recourse mortgages in which lenders have no

claim on borrowers beyond foreclosure, eectively giving homeowners a put option on their houses
with strike price equal to the mortgage principal; and even in other states with recourse mortgages,
personal bankruptcy allows consumers to escape residual mortgage debt relatively easily. This is not
the case in most European countries which have strong recourse provisions.

Finally, mortgages are

funded primarily through government-supported securitization in the US, through covered bonds
in many European countries including those where FRMs are available, and through depository
nancial institutions elsewhere.

Mortgage choice: ARMs vs. FRMs
From an individual household's point of view, the choice of an ARM versus a FRM trades o
risks and costs.

An ARM, like a oating-rate note, is an instrument with stable capital value but

volatile interest payments.

Monthly payments on an ARM increase with the nominal interest rate.

To the extent that the nominal interest rate moves with ination, the increased payments merely
compensate for inationary erosion of real principal value and can be oset by further borrowing
provided that the homeowner has unused borrowing capacity.

If the homeowner is borrowing-

constrained, however, or if the nominal interest rate increase is also an increase in the real interest

22

rate, then increased monthly ARM payments have a negative eect on the borrower's budget.
FRM, by contrast, has volatile capital value and stable nominal interest payments.

A

The risk to

the borrower is that ination declines, increasing the real burden of the xed nominal payments.
The option to renance a FRM is intended to limit this risk, but within the US system renancing
depends on the borrower's home equity and credit score, and on the functioning of mortgage-backed
security markets (Campbell & Cocco 2003, 2015).
The relative costs of ARMs and FRMs vary over time with market conditions.
in the literature about how to measure these costs.

There is a debate

Koijen et al. (2009) argue that homeowners

estimate the average ARM rate over the likely tenure of a mortgage, using a backward-looking rule of
thumb to do so, and compare the result with the prevailing FRM rate.
time-variation in the US ARM share quite well.

Their model describes recent

However Campbell & Cocco (2003) argue that

borrowing-constrained homeowners compare the current ARM rate to the FRM rate because they
value budget relief today, and because they may be allowed to take out a bigger ARM than FRM if
banks impose a limit on the current ratio of mortgage interest to income.

Badarinza et al. (2015)

use international panel data on mortgage rates and ARM shares, and nd evidence that homeowners
look no further forward than one year when deciding upon an ARM versus a FRM.

These authors

also present evidence for inertia in the ARM share, which may reect gradual adjustment of banks'
marketing strategies or households learning gradually from each others' choices.
The variation in the ARM share across countries seems to be inuenced by several deeper factors
including a country's historical ination volatility (Campbell 2013), regulatory system (notably
in the US where government housing policy implicitly subsidizes FRMs), and mortgage funding
arrangements.

FoÃ  et al. (2015) study variation in the ARM share across Italian banks, showing

that banks with greater oating-rate funding have greater ARM shares even after controlling for the
rates they quote.

FoÃ  et al. interpret this as showing that banks can manipulate the choices of their

15

customers through advertising or by steering their clients into mortgages they prefer to originate.

As with other areas of household nance, reinforcement learning and experience eects may play
a role in mortgage choice as well.

Botsch & Malmendier (2014) show that variation across cohorts

in experienced ination levels across their lifetimes appears to help to explain their choices of ARMs
versus FRMs, with lower experienced ination rates associated with a greater choice of ARMs.
Mortgage choice is important in part because of its macroeconomic consequences.

Reductions

in interest rates to combat a recession are likely to be more eective in an ARM system where lower
rates feed through immediately into mortgage payments without requiring renancing.

Di Maggio

et al. (2015) and Keys et al. (2014) use geographical variation in the ARM share across the US
(which results largely from dierences in housing costs interacting with the upper limit on the size
of FRMs eligible for implicit subsidy through GSE securitization) to argue that regions with high
ARM shares recovered more quickly from the Great Recession.

Mortgage renancing
Another longstanding theme of the household nance literature is that households often fail

15

There is also support in the US for the idea that funding arrangements aect mortgage choice through variations

in the supply of particular types of contracts.

Fuster and Vickery (2014) nd that the FRM share is lower at times

when mortgages are dicult to securitize  when it is arguably harder to fund long-term FRMs, as bank deposits
then become the proximate source of (maturity mismatched) funding.

23

to renance their mortgages even when it is advantageous for them to do so.

Such households

have been given the derogatory name of woodheads in mortgage industry slang.

The optimal

renancing decision is hard to calculate because the combination of xed renancing costs and
random variation in interest rates makes renancing a real option problem.

In fact, an empirically

realistic solution has only recently been oered in the academic literature by Agarwal et al. (2013b).
However some households seem to pay rates that are far above any reasonable renancing threshold
(Campbell 2006).

16

In the US context, it is challenging to measure the incidence of renancing mistakes because
borrower characteristics are only measured at mortgage origination, so researchers cannot easily
tell whether non-renancing borrowers have poor credit standing or negative home equity that
constrain them from renancing.

Andersen et al.

(2015) circumvent this problem by exploiting

the dierent rules of the Danish mortgage system, which grants an absolute right to renance to
lower the interest rate.

Using high-quality Danish data on household characteristics, they nd that

renancing mistakes are made more often by households with lower income and education and by
older households.

Financial and housing wealth have opposite eects, with renancing more likely

for households with high housing wealth relative to nancial wealth, that is, households for whom
the mortgage is a particularly important balance sheet item.
Andersen et al. model the failure to renance as a failure to pay attention to incentives.

An

alternative perspective is oered by Johnson et al. (2015) who argue that mistrust of banks is an
important deterrent to renancing.
Sluggish renancing provides prots to mortgage originators that, in a competitive mortgage
market, are passed on to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower interest rates.

This implies that

sophisticated borrowers, who know how to renance optimally, are subsidized by unsophisticated
borrowers, another instance of a shrouded equilibrium.

It also inhibits the introduction of easier-

to-use products such as automatically renancing mortgages, because the sophisticated households
who might naturally be early adopters of such products will lose the subsidy if they switch away
from conventional mortgages.
Do banks take advantage of or even manipulate these behavioral patterns? Mounting international evidence seems to point in this direction. Gurun et al. (2013) document a positive relationship
between local advertising and mortgage pricing in the US. They show that advertising is associated
with higher costs only for lenders who rely heavily on minorities and low-education areas. Almenberg & Karapetyan (2013) use data from the Swedish association of real estate agents and show
signicant consumer confusion and loan take-up mistakes in co-op loans, whose terms are less salient,
in the sense that they are less visible and easier for the consumer to ignore. Worryingly, Van Ooijen
& van Rooij (2014) also nd that Dutch households with a limited understanding of loan contracts,
who may need the advice the most, do not more often seek professional nancial advice than more
sophisticated homeowners.

Allen et al. (2014) use data from Canadian bank mergers to show that

such consolidation weakens consumer bargaining power in mortgage markets.

Mortgage default
The literature has also explored the determinants of mortgage default rates. In the US, authors

16

Sluggish renancing is not conned to FRM-based systems.

It also occurs in the UK, where ARMs have been

oered with teaser rates and no renancing penalties (Miles 2004).

24

have emphasized the role of supply (the expansion of credit to subprime borrowers) and demand
(unreasonable house price expectations) factors as driving the increases in delinquencies seen during the recent mortgage crisis (Mian & Su 2009 and Adelino et al.

2015).

Authors have also

investigated whether mortgage default by households is strategic, or simply triggered by economic
circumstances aecting borrowers' ability to pay, with recent ndings suggesting a limited scope for
strategic default (Gerardi et al., 2015).
There has been increasing attention to the eects of regulation on mortgage default.

Several

authors in the US have highlighted the role of subsidies to low income borrowers through the
Community Reinvestment Act (see, for example, Dahl et al.
et al.

2012).

2000, Kroszner 2008, and Agarwal

Using regulatory treatment discontinuities in India, Campbell et al.

(2015) also

nd evidence that subsidies matter for mortgage default, and that when regulators force lenders to
recognize delinquencies early in the life cycle of a loan, this has signicant impacts on longer-run
default rates.

Corbae & Quintin (2015) highlight the role of regulation in changing possible contract

types, and the attendant eects on default and foreclosure.

Their model shows that relaxations in

payment to income requirements are well able to explain increases in US default rates during the
crisis.
Others have studied the eects of lender market structure on foreclosure.

For example, Favara &

Giannetti (2015) conjecture that lenders with a large share of outstanding mortgages on their balance
sheets internalize the negative spillovers associated with the liquidation of defaulting mortgages and
are thus less inclined to foreclose.

They nd evidence using zip-code level data in the US that

those areas with a higher fraction of outstanding mortgages experience fewer foreclosures, and more
renegotiations of delinquent mortgages.

7 CONCLUSION
Research in household nance has shown conclusively that some households make better nancial
decisions than others, and that poor decisions can have rst-order consequences for households'
lifetime welfare.

The international comparative household nance literature conrms these ndings

using high-quality administrative data and strong identication that exploits unique features of
household nancial systems in dierent countries and their changes over time.
This paper has explored some possible determinants and consequences of these international
dierences.

As the literature moves forward, there will be an active debate about the relative merits

of dierent systems, and the possibility of transferring successful design features across national
boundaries.

Household nance economists both in academia and in consumer nancial regulators

such as the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
in the USwill be leading contributors to this discussion.

In this table, we compare the fractions of households which participate in assets and debt markets across countries. Panel A refers to nancial and non-nancial assets and Panel B to
mortgage- and non-mortgage debt. We include accounts with positive balances, as well as ones which households report as active, but which hold amounts equal to zero during the time of
the interview. The data sources are the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), the US Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF, 2010 wave), the Canadian Survey
of Financial Security (SFS, 2012 wave), the Australian Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey (HILDA, 2010 wave), and the UK Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS, 2012 wave).
Deposits include current accounts, checking, money market, savings and transaction accounts. Bonds include both sovereign and corporate xed-income products, both denominated in
domestic and foreign currency. Directly held stocks include publicly traded shares, employee shares and options, excluding amounts held through mutual funds or as part of registered
retirement pension plans. Other nancial assets include trust accounts, money owed to households, certicates, leases, proceeds from lawsuits (HFCS, SCF), other non-pension assets (SFS),
children's bank accounts (HILDA), children trust funds, National Savings Products and other investments (WAS). Retirement assets include all types of dened contribution plans (public,
occupational, or private) which have an account balance. The category labeled other debt includes unsecured loans, payday and informal loans (HFCS, WAS), unpaid hospital bills, loans
against life insurance (SCF) and bill payment arrears (WAS). The symbol "n.a." denotes asset or debt categories for which holdings are not separately classied, or for which data has not
been collected.

In this table, we compare the average allocations of household assets and liabilities across countries. Panel A refers to nancial and non-nancial assets and Panel B to mortgage- and
non-mortgage debt. The data sources are the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), the US Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF, 2010 wave), the Canadian
Survey of Financial Security (SFS, 2012 wave), the Australian Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey (HILDA, 2010 wave), and the UK Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS, 2012
wave). Deposits include current accounts, checking, money market, savings and transaction accounts. Bonds include both sovereign and corporate xed-income products, both denominated
in domestic and foreign currency. Directly held stocks include publicly traded shares, employee shares and options, excluding amounts held through mutual funds or as part of registered
retirement pension plans. Other nancial assets include trust accounts, money owed to households, certicates, leases, proceeds from lawsuits (HFCS, SCF), other non-pension assets (SFS),
children's bank accounts (HILDA), children trust funds, National Savings Products and other investments (WAS). Retirement assets include all types of dened contribution plans (public,
occupational, or private) which have an account balance. The category labeled other debt includes unsecured loans, payday and informal loans (HFCS, WAS), unpaid hospital bills, loans
against life insurance (SCF) and bill payment arrears (WAS). We express absolute holdings of assets and debt in 2010 US Dollars. We compute averages across households using population
weights, as indicated in each survey. The symbol "n.a." denotes asset or debt categories for which holdings are not separately classied, or for which data has not been collected.

Table 3: International comparison of mortgage markets

In this table, we rst report the time-series average and standard deviation of the share of adjustable-rate mortgages in the
total amount of new mortgage issuance (ARM share). The sample starts in 1991 (Australia), 1992 (USA), 1996 (Sweden),
2003 (Eurozone countries), 2004 (UK), 2005 (Finland) and ends in 2013. We then indicate the degree to which prepayment
penalties are a feature of respective mortgage markets. We use the term "Varying" to denote the situation in which dierent
amounts of prepayment penalties apply to dierent mortgage contracts or nancial institutions. Finally, we report the allocation
of outstanding mortgage volumes across sources of funding. The data corresponds to the year 2013 and is obtained from the
European Mortgage Federation and the Federal Reserve Board. The category Mortgage-backed securities contains both agencyand non-agency securities.

Fraction of households

In this gure, we compare the fractions of households with dened-contribution pension plans across countries. On the right
axis, we show the corresponding average value of accounts, conditional on contributing. Canada is not part of this sample
because the types of pension holdings are not separately classied in the Survey of Financial Security. We compute averages
across households using population weights, as indicated in each survey. All quantities are reported in 2010 US Dollars.
