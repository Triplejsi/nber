ABSTRACT
Using administrative employee-firm-level data on the entire private sector from 1994 to 2007, we
show that the labor market in France has polarized: employment shares of high and low wage
occupations have grown, while middle wage occupations have shrunk. During the same period,
the share of hours worked in technology-related occupations ("techies") grew substantially, as did
imports and exports, and we explore the causal links between these trends. Our paper is among
the first to analyze polarization in any country using firm-level data, and we show how
polarization occured within firms, but mostly due to changes in the composition of firms
(between firms). Motivated by the fact that technology adoption is mediated by technically
qualified managers and technicians, we use a new measure of the propensity of a firm to adopt
new technology: its employment share of techies. Using the subsample of firms that are active
over the whole period, we show that firms with more techies in 2002 saw greater polarization,
and grew faster, from 2002 to 2007. Offshoring reduced employment growth. Among blue-collar
workers in manufacturing, importing caused skill upgrading while exporting caused skill
downgrading. To control for the endogeneity of firm-level techies and trade in 2002, we use
values of techies and trade from 1994 to 1998 as instruments. We conclude that technological
change, mediated through techies, is an important cause of polarization in France. Firm-level
trade had important effects in manufacturing.

Introduction

Job polarization— growth in the shares of high-wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of middle
wage jobs— is one of the most striking phenomena in many advanced economies’ labor markets
in the last several decades.1 In this paper we study the extent, characteristics, and causes of job
polarization in France from 1994 to 2007.
Job polarization occurs between and within …rms over time, and we are among the …rst to
study polarization using …rm-level data. Studying …rm-level data is important because technological change and globalization a¤ect demand for labor through …rm-level decisions. We use administrative worker-…rm linked data for the entire French private sector to document how employment
shares have changed across 22 major occupations, which we rank by average wage. The comprehensive nature and high quality of the French administrative data allow us to describe changes in
employment shares in an unusually accurate way, compared to other research that typically relies
on survey data. We use an instrumental variables strategy to make causal inferences about the
importance of technology and trade in driving polarization.
We match workers with imports, exports and technology, through the …rms at which they work.
We construct a novel indicator for technology at the …rm level: the employment share of workers
who facilitate the adoption and use of new technology— the techies. We match customs data to
…rms to create import and export intensities. The matched …rm-worker nature of the data allow us
to study polarization along two complementary dimensions: within-…rm adjustment, and changes
in the employment share composition across …rms that have di¤erent occupational shares. In
addition, we exploit the …rm-worker match to construct measures of exposure to imports, exports
and technology, across occupations.
We show that, like many other countries, France has experienced job polarization: employment
shares of high-wage managers and professionals, among them technical managers and engineers,
increased; employment shares of middle income o¢ ce workers and industrial workers fell; and
employment shares of low-wage retail, personal service and unskilled manual workers increased.
However, the picture that emerges is more complex than this simple relationship between wage ranks
1
The United States (Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006), Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008), Firpo, Fortin, and
Lemieux (2011)), the United Kingdom (Goos and Manning (2007)), Germany (Spitz-Oener (2006), Dustmann, Ludsteck, and Schönberg (2007)), and more generally in Europe (Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2009) and Oesch (2013)).
Polarization contrasts with earlier labor market developments, where changes in employment shares of middle-wage
jobs were more modest, and the growth of high-wage jobs was at the expense of low-wage jobs. For example, in 1980s
in the U.S., changes in employment shares are positively related to wages in the 1980s Autor, Katz, and Kearney
(2008)).

and changes in employment shares. For example, employment in middle management declined, but
technicians increased their employment shares, while both occupations earn very similar middleincome wages.
The magnitudes of changes are large and they occurred relatively rapidly. Despite very di¤erent
labor market institutions, polarization in France from 1994 to 2007 is comparable both in shape and
in magnitude to polarization in the United States from 1980 to 2005 (Autor and Dorn (2013)).2 This
suggests that similar forces are at play. We …nd that polarization in France is a strong force that
increases inequality through reallocation of employment shares from middle-paying occupations to
both high and low-paying occupations.3
We decompose changes in employment shares into two components: within-…rm changes and
changes due to changes in …rm sizes (including entry and exit). We …nd that these two dimensions
explain varying shares of changes in employment across occupations. For example, within-…rm
changes explain nearly all of the overall drop in employment in skilled industrial workers, but
hardly any of the drop in employment in o¢ ce workers, where changes in …rm size composition
dominate. For the latter, this implies that employment growth in …rms that are intensive in o¢ ce
workers lags behind other …rms. Changes in composition also explain virtually all of the change in
employment shares of managers (both top and mid-level) and of unskilled industrial workers. We
are the …rst to document wide dispersion across occupations in the exposure of workers to imports,
exports and technology (techies).
We then ask what factors explain employment share changes in the 12 largest occupations
within …rms: importing, exporting or technology? Our identi…cation strategy allows us to make
causal inferences about these forces. We …nd that the main driving force is technology. While
the e¤ect of technology is pervasive, trade plays an important role only in manufacturing. Within
nonmanufacturing …rms, technology strongly increases employment shares of top managers, while
having the opposite (albeit smaller) e¤ect on o¢ ce and retail workers. Within manufacturing …rms,
technology causes an increase in employment shares of mid-level professionals (who are relatively
high in the wage distribution), while lowering shares of foremen and supervisors (who are closer
to the middle of the wage distribution) and of o¢ ce workers. At the same time, technology causes
signi…cant skill downgrading among blue collar workers.
2

See Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2014) for a comparison across European countries, including France.
This is consistent with overall decreasing inequality in France, because changes in occupational wages tend to
compress the overall wage distribution, as we discuss in more detail below. For example, Verdugo (2014) shows that
changes in the composition of French employment across education and experience groups increase inequality in the
face of overall reductions in inequality. See also Charnoz, Coudin, and Gaini (2013) for a broad view of trends in
inequality in France.

Trade a¤ects the occupational mix, but mainly in manufacturing. Importing causes strong skill
upgrading: employment shares of skilled industrial and manual laborers increase, while the share of
unskilled industrial workers falls. This is consistent with a simple o¤shoring story, where imported
intermediates substitute for low-skill workers within manufacturing …rms, but are complementary to
skilled workers. We …nd that exporting increases employment shares of top managers, lowers shares
of (mid-wage) skilled industrial and manual workers, and increases shares of (low-wage) unskilled
industrial workers— causing strong polarization within manufacturing. As with technology, these
…ndings imply skill downgrading among blue collar workers in response to exporting.
Our results on skill downgrading within blue-collar occupations in response to technological
change and exporting are new and intriguing, and we discuss them at length below.
Turning to between-…rm changes, we …nd that technology has substantial e¤ects on …rms’overall
employment shares: techie-intensive …rms grow much faster than other …rms. Importing has large
e¤ects on employment growth in manufacturing: …rms that import from low and middle income
countries see substantially slower employment growth. This is mostly due to imports of intermediate
inputs, which suggests that o¤shoring contributes to slower …rm-level employment growth.
As the second largest economy in Europe, France is a good laboratory for studying changes
in the structure of employment, where, due to its relatively rigid wage structure, shocks are more
likely to a¤ect employment rather than wages. Card, Kramarz, and Lemieux (1999) estimate similar
employment responses to demand shocks across demographic groups in France, Canada and the
U.S. In contrast, while wages in France are overall insensitive to demand shocks, wages do respond
to demand shocks in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in Canada.4 These …ndings contribute to
the external validity of our work.5 Our …ndings indicate the pervasiveness of job polarization: we
observe a similar pattern of changes in employment shares in France as in the U.S. and the U.K.,
despite large di¤erences in the way the wage distribution has evolved.
4
In recent work Bozio, Breda, and Guillot (2016) document a similar increase in relative labor costs (including
employer contributions, as opposed to net or gross wages) in France as in the U.K. and other similar economies
(although still less than in the U.S.). They also estimate similar responses of relative labor costs to demand shifts as
in the U.S.
5
Jaimovich and Siu (2012) show that the disappearance of routine-intensive jobs in the U.S. from the 1980s coincides with “jobless recoveries". Our sample, 1994–2007, however, coincides with a relatively stable period in the
French economy. Cortes, Jaimovich, Nekarda, and Siu (2014) estimate that the drop in employment in routine occupations in the U.S. is driven by changes in employment transition rates (between jobs, and between employment and
non-employment), mainly among men, the young, and low skilled individuals— but not due to changes in demographic
composition.

1.1

Relationship to existing literature

Our work contributes to the literature that documents the pervasiveness of job polarization, and
studies its causes. It is distinguished by the quality of the administrative data, its comprehensiveness (the entire French private sector), our focus on within and between …rm changes, and by
causal inference. The features of the French occupational classi…cation make it particularly useful
for understanding polarization, for example, by distinguishing between di¤erent skill levels within
similar functions (e.g., industrial and manual labor workers). These skills are determined by employers’assessment, which makes them closer to the economic notion of “skill", rather than being
determined by educational credentials (which are typically based on individual employee reporting).
The within-function skill dimension is absent in previous work on polarization.
This is the …rst paper to describe that both analyzes polarization across and within …rms and
makes causal inference at this disaggregate level. Since employment decisions are made at the …rm
level, …rm-level data is ideal for studying polarization. In contrast, Beaudry, Doms, and Lewis
(2010) and Autor and Dorn (2013) exploit geographical variation across local labor markets within
the U.S., and Michaels, Natraj, and Van Reenen (2014) exploit variation across industries within
countries.6 Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2014) address the roles of both within-industry changes
and changes in industrial composition. While they are successful in explaining the contribution of
changes in industrial composition to polarization, they are less successful in explaining the withinindustry contribution. Our work shows that for many occupations, changes in the composition
of …rms matter the most for understanding changes in aggregate employment shares. We discuss
these …ndings in detail below.
Industry level analysis masks substantial variation across …rms. The importance of …rms in
explaining relative demand shifts can be illustrated by juxtaposing Berman, Bound, and Griliches
(1994) with Bernard and Jensen (1997). While Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994) show that
most (70%) of the increase in relative demand for nonproduction workers in U.S. manufacturing in
the 1980s is driven by within-industry changes (versus changes in industry composition), Bernard
and Jensen (1997)— using the diasaggregate data underlying the industry analysis of Berman,
Bound, and Griliches (1994)— show that variation in plant size composition explains most (60%)
of the increase in their wage bill share in this period. This led to opposing conclusions about the
relative roles of trade versus technology in driving the same relative demand shift.
6
Beaudry, Doms, and Lewis (2010) exploit variation across U.S. cities, but do not study polarization; they study
changes in demand for skill (college-equivalent workers). Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) exploit variation in
industrial composition across local labor markets and estimate signi…cant e¤ects of imports from China on employment
and wages in U.S. manufacturing.

5

We are aware of only a few other papers that study polarization using comprehensive matched
worker-…rm data.7 The closest paper to ours is Kerr, Maczuskij, and Maliranta (2015), who study
polarization in Finland in 2000–2009. As we do, they decompose changes in occupational employment shares into within and between-…rm changes. For a subset of their sample they match
both trade and technology indicators at the …rm level. When analyzing the e¤ects of trade and
technology on polarization, Kerr et al instrument for …rm level trade (as we do), but are not able
to address the endogeneity of their technology measures. Böckerman, Laaksonen, and Vainiomäki
(2013) also analyzes Fnnish …rm-level data, and …nd eveidence of within-frm polarization, but due
to the absence of strong instruments are not able to make causal statements.
Keller and Utar (2015) analyze polarization within the Danish textile and apparel sector. Although they use …rm level data, they do not exploit the …rm level dimension in their analysis. Using
a sample of workers employed in the sector in 1999, they show that the end of quota protection
caused trade-exposed workers in middle-wage occupations within the textile and apparel sector to
move disproportionately into higher and lower paid occupations. While not directly comparable to
our economy-wide analysis, which focuses on longer term trends rather than outcomes of individual
workers, the analysis of Keller and Utar (2015) is consistent with our …ndings. In addition— and
similar to our aggregate analysis— they show that polarization in Denmark in 1991–2009 progressed
much faster than in the United States in 1980–2005.
The main explanation for job polarization in the literature is the “routinization hypothesis"
(Goos and Manning (2007)). As argued in Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003), technological progress
in information and communications technology (ICT) allows machines to replace codi…able cognitive
routine tasks that were once performed by humans. These tasks happen to be more prevalent— or
“bundled"— in occupations that are, on average, in the middle of the wage distribution. Thus, the
di¤usion of ICT lowers demand for these occupations. At the same time, ICT complements nonroutine cognitive tasks, and demand for occupations that are characterized by these tasks— which
are higher up in the wage distribution— rises. Occupations at the bottom of the wage distribution
are less a¤ected by ICT, and they absorb the residual supply of labor.8 Our results broadly support
the importance of the ‘routinization hypothesis".
7

Cortes and Salvatori (2015) document a large increase in the proportion of workplaces that specialize in nonroutine tasks in the United Kingdom. Changes in industry composition plays a minor role in this. But because
Cortes and Salvatori (2015) cannot track establishments over time, they cannot make statements about the role
establishment composition versus within-establishment changes.
8
Acemoglu and Autor (2011) provide an analytical framework that suggests how tasks are bundled across types
of workers (di¤erentiated by education level or skill), and how changes in demand for these tasks a¤ect employment
shares of these types.

6

A second force that could help explain job polarization is o¤shoring, where domestic labor is
replaced by labor abroad (see among many others Feenstra and Hanson (1996), Grossman and
Rossi-Hansberg (2008), Rodriguez-Clare (2010), Blinder and Krueger (2013)). Our results suggest
a modest role for o¤shoring in explaining polarization, for the simple reason that polarization is
concentrated in the non-manufacturing sector where o¤shoring is rare. Similarly, Feenstra and
Hanson (1999) estimate that imports of intermediate inputs have a small e¤ect on relative demand
for skilled labor in U.S. manufacturing from 1979 to 1990, while computers have a large e¤ect.
Michaels, Natraj, and Van Reenen (2014) come to a similar conclusion, as does Oesch (2013).9
Moreno-Galbis and Sopraseuth (2014) …nd that population aging is an additional factor that
can help explain the increase employment at the bottom of the wage distribution. Older people
have relatively high demand for personal services— largely provided by low-wage workers— thus,
population aging can help explain the rise of employment in low-paid positions. Another force
which may operate at the bottom of the wage distribution is immigration, since this is where
most immigrants …nd employment, at least initially; however, Oesch (2013) dismisses this as an
important factor.
An important force that may be part of the explanation of changes in aggregate occupational
employment shares is labor market regulation. Indeed, France experienced changes in labor market
regulation during the period we study, most notably changes in regulations of the 35-hour working
week. However, as Askenazy (2013) points out, the 35-hour regulations were designed to not a¤ect
aggregate labor demand measured in hours — which is our unit of analysis— and in fact, they
probably didn’t. The 35-hour regulations were designed to share the existing demand across more
workers, in an attempt to reduce unemployment. Even if changes in the 35-hour regulations did
a¤ect industries and occupations di¤erently, this does not a¤ect our identi…cation of causal forces,
as we explain below.
Our work is closely related to Maurin and Thesmar (2004), who investigate changes in employment composition within French manufacturing from 1984 to 1995. Using survey data, they
…nd that employment in product design and marketing increases, while employment in production
drops— both for high and low-skilled workers within these categories (quali…é and non-quali…é,
respectively). Concurrently, employment in high-skill administrative jobs declines. Maurin and
9

Becker and Muendler (2014) show that overall German employment in 1979–2006 shifted towards “nono¤shorable" activities, while imports of intermediate inputs increase, suggesting a role for o¤shoring in explaining
changes in labor demand. However, they do not address polarization, they do not investigate the role of technology,
nor do they identify causal relationships.

7

Thesmar (2004) associate these changes to technological change. Using …rm level data from 1988
to 1992, Maurin, Thoenig, and Thesmar (2002) …nd evidence that increases in employment in
product design and marketing within French manufacturing …rms may be related to exporting.10
A key objective of our is paper is to identify causal relationships of technology and trade on
…rm’s occupational composition and size. Our identi…cation strategy relies on initial conditions
across …rms to explain changes in occupational composition and size. We use lagged values as
instruments and discuss their validity in detail. This strategy is similar to that of Beaudry, Doms,
and Lewis (2010) and Autor and Dorn (2013), who exploit variation across space and use lagged
initial conditions as instruments that help identify the propensitiy of local labor markets to respond
to technological change. Michaels, Natraj, and Van Reenen (2014) estimate “long di¤erences" speci…cations and exploit variation across industries (within countries), and instrument for di¤erences
in ICT intensity by using intial conditions in the United States. Goos, Manning, and Salomons
(2014) do not address causality.
There are also important di¤erences between our econometric approach and those in Beaudry,
Doms, and Lewis (2010) and Autor and Dorn (2013). Beaudry, Doms, and Lewis (2010) …nd
that higher supply of college-educated workers (and commensurate low returns to college) in 1980
predicts higher rates of computer adoption and higher increases in the returns to college across
U.S. cities. In contrast, Autor and Dorn (2013) …nd that higher levels of routine-task labor input
(which is not particularly high skilled) across local labor markets in 1980 predicts higher rates of
information technology adoption, job polarization and in‡ows of skilled labor.11 Our approach
di¤ers from both of these. The …rm level lends itself more naturally to studying and identifying
the mechanisms of adjustment. Firms that are initially more technologically-intensive in 2002 are
more sensitive to reductions in the cost of computing power. Our innovative approach is to proxy
technology-intensity with the share of techies in …rm employment; the techie share captures the
propensity to adopt technology at the …rm level. Firms with a higher techie share exhibit larger
changes in occupational composition and higher overall employment growth. Our approach is
appropriate for our sample, which starts after information technology becomes all but ubiquitous,
and while polarization is evident.
10

Related to this, Thesmar and Thoenig (2000) use data from France from 1984 to 1995 to show that increases
in product market volatility and creative destruction can lead to …rm organizational change, namely substitution of
product design and marketing workers for production workers.
11
Beaudry, Doms, and Lewis (2010) use initial supply of “college equivalents”, de…ned as workers who have a least
a 4-year college degree plus one-half of those with at least some college education. If the "some college" group are
predominantly employed in routine-intensive occupations in 1980, then this can help reconclie the seemingly di¤erent
predictions of Autor and Dorn (2013).

8

Biscourp and Kramarz (2007) study the role of trade in explaining employment declines in
French manufacturing from 1986 to 1992. They …nd that imports of …nal goods are associated
with declines in production workers’ employment, and in particular low-skill production workers’
employment. In contrast, Goux and Maurin (2000) investigate the causes of the decline in lowskill employment in France form 1970 to 1993. Using survey data, they estimate that changes
in industrial composition— not technological change or globalization— drive this decline.12 These
results contrast with Katz and Murphy (1992) (for the U.S., 1963–1987) and Berman, Bound, and
Griliches (1994) (for U.S. manufacturing, 1979–1989), who argue that intra-industry changes are
most important. Our empirical strategy identi…es causal e¤ects from within-industry variation, so
we are silent on this issue.
By studying job polarization, we also contribute to the literature on wage inequality in France.
In contrast to other comparable industrial economies— e.g., the U.S., U.K., Canada and Germany—
France has had relative stability in wage inequality since 1980. As Charnoz, Coudin, and Gaini
(2013) and Verdugo (2014) show, the 90/10 percentile ratio falls all through our sample, and this is
mostly driven by a compression in the 50/10 percentile ratio. In contrast, top wage income shares
(top 1% and 0.1%) in France have increased markedly, contributing to an increase in inequality,
albeit less than in other countries; see Landais (2008), Amar (2010), Godechot (2012), and Piketty
(2014). We estimate that polarization is a strong force that increases inequality, and that withinoccupation wage compression counterbalances this.
Kramarz (2008) studies the e¤ect of o¤shoring on …rm-level employment in French manufacturing from 1986 to 1992. He estimates that French …rms that faced strong labor unions lowered
employment and o¤shored more than …rms facing weaker wage bargaining by workers. Our empirical strategy uses …rm level importing activity directly. Carluccio, Fougere, and Gautier (2014)
investigate the separate e¤ects of exporting and importing on wage bargaining and the resulting
wages of workers in French manufacturing from 2005 to 2009.

1.2

Roadmap to the paper

Our paper has two types of empirical …ndings, descriptive and econometric. After describing the
data in Section 2, we document the polarization of the French labor market, and how polarization
has evolved both within and between …rms, in Section 3. This section also introduces new measures
of how workers in a given occupation are exposed to trade and to workers in di¤erent occupations.
12

Exports and imports have o¤setting e¤ects on net, but are estimated to have some e¤ects on gross reallocations
within industries. This echoes the analysis in Harrigan and Reshef (forthcoming).

9

In Section 4 we present a simple model of …rm-level technology which is used to motivate the
econometric analysis in Section 6. The econometric analysis shows how …rm characteristics in 2002
a¤ect both within-…rm polarization and between-…rm employment growth from 2002 to 2007.

Data source description

To study job polarization in France we use …rm-level data on trade and employment from 1994
to 2007. This 14 year period saw big changes in technology, globalization, and economic policy:
the tech boom of the late 1990s, Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001,
the introduction of the euro in 1999, and steady progress in integrating goods, …nancial, and labor
markets within the European Union. During most of our sample France was governed by the centerright.13 It was also a period of macroeconomic stability in France, with no recessions (annual growth
slowed to just under 1 percent in 2002 and 2003, and averaged 2.4 percent during the rest of the
period). During this period, the French government implemented a set of labor market reforms
intended to lower labor costs and increase employment, especially of low-skilled workers (Askenazy
(2013)). This section gives an overview of our data sources and details about data de…nitions and
matching of …rms. For compactness of the exposition, we relegate additional important details to
the appendix.

2.1

Workers and …rms: DADS Poste

Our source for information on workers is the DADS Poste, which is based on mandatory annual
reports …led by all …rms with employees, so that our data includes all private sector French workers
except the self-employed.14 Our unit of analysis is annual hours paid in a …rm, by occupation.15
For each worker, the DADS reports gross and net wages, hours paid, occupation, tenure, gender and
age. There is no information about workers’education or overall labor market experience. The data
do not include worker identi…ers, so we can not track workers over time, but this is of no concern
to us given our focus on long-run trends rather than individual outcomes.16 Throughout the paper,
13

The Socialist President Francois Mitterand left o¢ ce in Spring 1995 with a National Assembly controlled by the
center-right government of prime minister Édouard Balladur until 1997. During 1997–2002 prime minister Lionel
Jospin’s left-wing government cohabitated with right-wing president Jacques Chirac. During 2002–2007, both the
presidency and government in France were of the center-right.
14
The DADS Poste is an INSEE database compiled from the mandatory …rm-level DADS (“Déclaration Annuelle
de Données Sociales") reports. See the appendix for details.
15
The data is reported at the level of establishments, which are identi…ed by their SIRET. The …rst nine digits of
each SIRET is the …rm-level SIREN, which makes it easy to aggregate across establishments for each …rm.
16
The DADS Panel is a related dataset which has been used by researchers interested in following individuals over
time (for example, Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) and Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006)). The DADS Panel is
a 1/25 sample of individuals in the DADS Poste.

10

our measure of labor input is annual …rm-level hours paid rather than head count. The DADS
Poste has no information about the …rm beyond the …rm identi…er and industry and, implicitly,
…rm-level aggregates related to employment such as total hours by occupation, average wages, etc.
From 1994 to 2007, 2.9 million private sector …rms appear in our DADS Poste data.17 These
…rms range in size from tiny cafes and tabacs to giant industrial enterprises and retailers. Our
descriptive analysis includes all 2.9 million …rms, but in our econometric analysis we focus on the
subset of …rms that were in operation continuously from 1994 to 2007. There are 310,713 of these
“permanent" …rms, with 85% of hours paid in nonmanufacturing. Though these …rms represent
about 11 percent of …rms in our sample, they are much larger than the average …rm, and account
for about half of aggregate hours in each year. The share of nonmanufacturing hours within the
"permanent" …rms is only one percent point smaller than in the larger sample.18 Changes in
occupational shares within "permanent" …rms are also very similar to the larger sample (we discuss
this in more detail below in Section 5.2).

2.2

Occupations: the PCS

Every job in the DADS is categorized by a two digit PCS occupation code.19 Excluding agricultural
and public sector categories, the PCS has 22 occupational categories, listed in Table 1.20 These 22
categories are consistently de…ned over our period of analysis.21 In much of our analysis we focus
on the 14 larger PCS categories indicated in bold in Table 1, each of which comprises between 2
percent and 13 percent of private sector hours, and which together comprise 95 percent of hours.
Each two digit PCS category is an aggregate of as many as 40 four digit subcategories. Although
hours data is not available by four digit category, the descriptions of the four digit categories in Table
2 are helpful in understanding the kinds of tasks performed within two-digit categories, and make
it clear that the two-digit categories are economically meaningful. The subcategories also suggest
di¤erences in the susceptibility of jobs to automation and/or o¤shoring. For example, Personal
Service workers (PCS 56) such as restaurant servers, hair stylists, and child care providers do the sort
of “non-routine manual" tasks (c.f. Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003)) that require both proximity
and human interaction. The same can be said for Retail Workers (PCS 55) and both skilled and
17

SIRENs in the DADS Poste are classi…ed by “categorie juridique”. We de…ne private …rms as those with SIRENs
other than categorie juridique 4, 7, or 9. There are 457,958 other SIRENs in the DADS Poste, including public
sector enterprises and nonpro…ts.
18
See detailed information in the appendix.
19
PCS stands for Professions et Catégories Socioprofessionnelles.
20
We also exclude a very small category …rst introduced in 2002, PCS 31, and allocate these workers to PCS 34.
21
There are some small discontinuities in how workers are assigned to occupations between 2001 and 2002, due to
improvements in data processing in 2002. See the appendix for more details and for a description of how we cope
with this issue.

11

unskilled manual laborers (PCS 63 and 68), whose jobs include gardening, cooking, repair, building
trades, and cleaning. In contrast, mid-level professionals and managers (PCS 46) often do routine
cognitive tasks that can be done more cheaply by computers or overseas workers. Industrial workers
(PCS 62 and 67) doing routine manual work are unquestionably directly in competition with both
robots and imported intermediate goods. Drivers (PCS 64) do a job which can be neither o¤shored
nor automated (at least for now), while the work of skilled transport/wholesale/logistics workers
(PCS 65) is likely subject to automation.
Two occupations are of particular interest: PCS 38 “Technical managers and engineers" and
PCS 47 “Technicians".22 As is clear from the detailed descriptions in Table 2, many workers in
these categories are closely connected with the installation, management, maintenance, and support
of information and communications technology (ICT) and other new technologies. These are jobs
that require technical training, skill, and experience, so we refer to workers in these two occupations
as “techies". Our hypothesis is that techies mediate the adoption of new technology within …rms:
they are the ones who plan, purchase, and install new technology, and who train and support other
workers in the use of new technology. In short, if a …rm invests in new technology, it needs techies,
and …rms with more techies are probably more technologically sophisticated …rms.
One potential problem with our hypothesis that …rm-level techies are an indicator of …rmlevel technological sophistication is that …rms can purchase ICT consulting services. By hiring
a consultant, …rms can obtain and service new ICT without increasing their permanent sta¤ of
techies. However, only 0.7% of techie hours are in the IT consulting sector, which implies that
almost all of the hourly services supplied by techies are obtained in-house rather than purchased
from consultants.23

2.3

Matched …rm-trade

Our source for …rm-level trade data is the French Customs.24 For each trade observation, we know
the importing or exporting …rm, trading partner country, the product traded, and the value of
trade. We use the …rm-level SIREN identi…er to match the trade data to the DADS Poste data on
employment. This match is not perfect: we fail to match about 11 percent of imports and exports
to …rms. The reason for the imperfect match is that there are SIRENs in the trade data for which
22

A precise de…nition of these categories of workers is given in the appendix.
We refer to the IT consulting sector as industry code 72 in the NAF classi…cation, which includes the following subcategories: Hardware consultancy, Publishing of software, Other software consultancy and supply, Data processing,
Database activities, Maintenance and repair of o¢ ce, Accounting and computing machinery, and Other computer
related activities.
24
The appendix gives the details about the match between the French Customs and the DADS Poste datasets.
23

12

there is no corresponding SIREN in the DADS Poste. This is likely to lead to a particular type of
measurement error: for some …rms, we will observe zero trade even when true trade is positive.

Descriptive results

In this section we do …ve things:
1. Show how the French job market polarized between 1994 and 2007, both within and between
…rms.
2. Illustrate the March of the Techies: the growing importance of occupations that specialize in
new technology.
3. Calculate the extent to which polarization has been a force that increases wage inequality.
4. Introduce a new measure of an occupation’s exposure to trade.
5. Characterize the extent to which employees in di¤erent occupations work together in the same
…rm, with particular attention to employees working in …rms with techies.
Our basic unit of observation is hours paid in a …rm, classi…ed by occupation. We report various
aggregates of this data, using the following notation:

Occupational polarization and the March of the Techies

In this section we present the …rst major results of our paper: the French occupational structure
polarized between 1994 and 2007, with high-wage and low-wage occupations growing at the expense
of middle-wage occupations. To show this, we begin with Figure 2, which plots economy-wide occupational hours shares Sot from 1994 to 2007, separately for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing
(for readability, the scales are di¤erent for each occupation). The share of hours by upper and
technical managers, along with technicians, saw steady growth, while the share worked by middle
13

managers and foremen-supervisors fell. The largest occupation in 1994, o¢ ce workers, fell steadily,
while retail and personal service jobs grew. Among industrial workers in manufacturing, there was
substantial skill upgrading, with the share of hours accounted for by high skilled workers rising as
the share of low skilled workers declined.
Particularly striking in Figure 2 is the rapid growth in the techie occupations, Technical Managers and Engineers (PCS 38) and Technicians (PCS 47). While techies have a larger hours share
in manufacturing, they also have a large and growing presence in nonmanufacturing, especially
Technical Managers. We call this growth in the importance of these two occupations The March
of the Techies.
We next connect changes in occupational shares to average occupational wages. Polarization is
illustrated vividly in Figure 3, which plots the change in an occupation’s share of aggregate hours
from 1994 to 2007 against the occupation’s rank in the wage distribution in 2002.25 The circles are
proportional to the average size of occupations, and the curve is a weighted quadratic regression
line. The pattern is clear: the two large, highly-paid occupations on the right, PCS 37 (Managers)
and PCS 38 (Technical Managers) grew, as did three large low-wage occupations on the left: PCS
68 (Low-skilled manual laborers), PCS 56 (Personal service workers), and PCS 55 (Retail workers).
The middle-wage occupations that shrank over the period include skilled industrial workers and
manual laborers (PCS 62 and 63), unskilled industrial workers (PCS 67), and clerical and middlemanagement workers (PCS 54 and 46). Exceptions to this pattern in the middle of the wage
distribution include drivers (PCS 64), an occupation that can be neither o¤shored nor automated,
and Technicians (PCS 47). To summarize, polarization and the march of the techies proceeded
together from 1994 to 2007.
Theses changes are large and occurred relatively rapidly. Polarization in France in from 1994
to 2007 is comparable both in shape and in magnitude to polarization in the United States from
1980 to 2005 (Autor and Dorn (2013)), a period almost twice as long.26
Figures 4 for nonmanufacturing and 5 for manufacturing …rms o¤er a useful re…nement of
the economy-wide story seen in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the di¤erent fortunes of o¢ ce workers
(PCS 54), whose hours share plummeted, and of the lower-paid service sector occupations, retail
25

This ranking is stable over time, and insensitive to de…ning wages as gross or net of payroll taxes.
To see this, notice that the scale of Panel A of Figure 1 in Autor and Dorn (2013) is “100 change in employment
share", and each observation is for one percentile. In contrast, we have 22 occupations. This means that each 0.1
unit in their …gure translates to 0:45 = 0:1=100 (100=22) 100 percent points, on average, in our …gures. See Goos,
Manning, and Salomons (2014) for a comparison across European countries.
26

14

and personal service workers (PCS 55 and 56), whose ranks swelled considerably. There was skill
downgrading within manual workers (PCS 63 fell while 68 grew).
As seen in Figure 5, a simple polarization story does not describe what happened within manufacturing. Instead, the key fact is skill upgrading among blue-collar industrial workers: the hours
share of the skilled (PCS 62) grew at the same time that the share for unskilled workers (PCS 67)
plunged. As in nonmanufacturing, the managerial categories (PCS 37 and 38) grew strongly while
o¢ ce workers and middle managers (PCS 54 and 46) shrank.
3.1.1

Polarization within and between …rms

We turn next to a more detailed analysis of the changes in hours shares just described: did they
occur due to within-…rm adjustment, changes in …rm size, or both? The change in Sot , the share of
hours in occupation o in the economy, can be decomposed into changes within and between …rms
as follows:
Sot =

where

ft

X
|

X

f t sf o +

f

{z

between

} |

f

f

{z

sf ot

within

(1)

}

is …rm f ’s share of economywide hours, sf ot is the share of occupation o in …rm f , and

overbars indicate simple time averages. Entry and exit of …rms is accounted for by changes in the
ft

from zero to positive or from positive to zero. The results of this decomposition are reported

in Table 3 for the whole period and the entire private sector. The fourteen largest occupations are
boxed in Table 3 and illustrated in Figure 6.
Begin by looking at the full period for all …rms, which is illustrated in Figure 6 and reported
in the …rst four columns of Table 3. The top managerial categories both grew a lot, but technical
managers (PCS 38, +2.0pp) grew much faster than upper managers (PCS 37, +1.4pp). Middle
manager (PCS 46, -1.5pp) and supervisor (PCS 48, -0.4pp) jobs shrank, but similarly-paid technician jobs (PCS 47, +1.0pp) grew substantially. Turning to the lower paid occupations, we see
substantial polarization and evidence consistent with the decline of jobs vulnerable to automation
and o¤shoring. Among the white collar occupations, o¢ ce jobs (PCS 54, -2.0pp) plunged while
lower paid retail (PCS 55, +1.5pp) and personal service (PCS 56, +1.2) jobs grew. Among blue
collar occupations, the picture is more nuanced: high skill industrial (PCS 62, -1.0pp) and manual
labor (PCS 63, -0.3pp) jobs fell, but similarly skilled and paid jobs in driving (PCS 64, +0.7pp)
and distribution (PCS 65, +0.2pp) grew. At the bottom of the skill ladder, relatively well-paid
industrial jobs (PCS 67, -3.0pp) plunged while the lowest paid occupation in the economy (low
skilled manual labor, PCS 68, +0.4) grew.
15

The between-within decompositions help us understand these changes in greater depth. Focus
…rst on the fortunes of high and low skill industrial workers, PCS 62 and PCS 67, both of whom saw
big overall declines. For the high-skill industrial workers in PCS 62, the overall decline of -1.0pp
was more than entirely due to within-…rm changes: …rms that had above average amounts of these
workers actually contributed +0.2pp to hours growth, but within …rm shedding of these workers
contributed a -1.2pp drop. The story is exactly the opposite for the low skill industrial workers in
PCS 67: the overall collapse of -3.0pp was driven by a -3.4 drop due to between-…rm changes, with
hours actually being added within …rms, +0.4pp. Putting these two facts together implies that
…rms intensive in skilled industrial workers grew, but within these …rms there was substitution of
unskilled for skilled industrial workers. Firms intensive in low skill industrial workers in PCS 67
exhibit disproportionately low employment growth.
Next, consider the skilled and unskilled manual labor occupations, PCS 63 and PCS 68. As
discussed above, these jobs are probably less subject to both automation and o¤shoring than the
similarly skilled, but better paid, industrial jobs. Firms that were intensive in these occupations
shrank, contributing -1.3pp and -0.4pp to the overall declines in PCS 63 and PCS 68 respectively.
But within …rms the importance of these jobs actually increased substantially, by 1.0pp and 0.8pp
respectively. In other words, even as these manual-labor-intensive …rms shrank, they did so by
shedding other workers faster than their manual laborers.
Drivers, PCS 64, are the archetypal low-skill job that can not be automated (at least for now)
or o¤shored. Thus, it is not surprising that their hours share grew +0.7pp, even as other blue-collar
jobs were shrinking. This was driven by within-…rm changes, +1.1pp, that were partly o¤set by a
between-…rm decline in …rms that use a lot of drivers, -0.4pp.
Turning to clerical workers, PCS 54, the -2.0pp collapse in o¢ ce jobs was more than accounted
for by the between-…rm component: …rms that had a lot of o¢ ce workers shrank substantially,
contributing -2.4pp to the overall decline, even as the within-…rm component was +0.4. This
within-between split is not consistent with a simple story of replacing clerical workers with computers; rather, it is suggestive of a heavy reliance on o¢ ce workers being associated with slower …rm
employment growth. This …nding suggests that models that rely on substitution— either within
local labor markets or industries— are missing an important dimension of the mechanics of polarization.
The accompanying boom in lower-paid retail (PCS 55, +1.5pp) and personal service (PCS 56,
+1.2pp) jobs was fairly evenly split across the within and between components. Thus, …rms heavy
16

in retail and/or personal service jobs expanded, and increased the share of these jobs within their
…rms as they did so.
The march of the techies was broad based. Both technical managers (PCS 38, +2.0pp) and
technicians (PCS 47, +1pp) grew rapidly. This growth was mainly accounted for by between-…rm
changes (techie-intensive …rms grew faster, accounting for more than 75% of total techie hours
growth), but in addition …rms on average shifted hours toward techies.
3.1.2

Polarization and …rm entry/exit

As noted above, entry and exit of …rms is accounted for by changes in the …rm employment shares
from zero to positive or from positive to zero in equation (1). The subset of …rms that have

ft

positive hours in every year from 1994 to 2007, which we call “permanent" …rms, account for about
half of total hours in each year. The other half of hours are accounted for by …rms that enter
and/or exit between 1994 and 2007. Here we focus on the contribution of net entry by these other
…rms to the overall changes in occupational hours shares. Letting the set of permanent …rms be
denoted by P and the set of other …rms as O, the decomposition in (1) can be re-written as
Sot =

Table 4 reports the results of the decomposition in (2), separately for nonmanufacturing and manufacturing …rms.27 Column 6 of the Table shows that in most cases the contribution of net entry is
the same sign as the overall change. In a few occupations (Personal Service Workers in nonmanufacturing and Supervisors in manufacturing) net entry accounts for the bulk of the overall change.
The overall skill upgrading of industrial workers in manufacturing, as seen by growth in the share
of skilled industrial workers (+3.8pp, PCS 62) and a drop in the share of the unskilled (-5.9pp, PCS
67), is driven by a combination of an increase in skill intensity both within and between permanent
…rms combined with substantial net exit of …rms intensive in unskilled industrial workers (-4.3pp,
PCS 67). The expansion of the techie occupations is similar in permanent and other …rms.

3.2

Contribution of polarization to inequality

How much does job polarization contribute to wage inequality? Reallocation of labor from middlepaying occupations to both high and low-paying occupations mechanically increases inequality,
and here we calculate that this is a strong force towards higher inequality in France. While wage
27

Table 4 omits occupations that amounted to less than 3 percent of sectoral hours in 2002

17

inequality in our sample is relatively stable, this is the result of opposing forces. While changes
in occupational employment shares increase inequality, changes in wages across occupations tend
to compress the wage distribution. In other words, if it wasn’t for job polarization, France would
have experienced a signi…cant compression in the wage distribution.
We measure wage inequality across occupations in year t by the weighted standard deviation of
average relative occupational wages:
v
u
uX
t
Sot
o

wot
wt

2

1

(3)

where Sot is the hours share of occupation o, wot is the average wage of occupation o, and wt is the
overall average wage.28 Occupational inequality as measured by (3) rose a modest 6 percent from
0.485 in 1994 to 0.514 in 2007.
Changes in (3) embody two forces: changes in average occupational wages and in the shares
of occupations in the economy. To isolate the impact of polarization (compositional changes in
occupational employment shares) on this measure of inequality, we proceed in two ways. The …rst
is to …x wages in 1994 and let employment shares evolve as in the data. We …nd that polarization
contributed 153% of the actual increase in occupational inequality from 1994 to 2007. In the
second calculation we …x employment shares in 1994 and let relative wages evolve as in the data.
We …nd that changes in occupational wages contribute

14% of the actual increase in

from 1994

to 2007, and implies that polarization contributed 124% of the change. The di¤erence between
these two calculation arises from the interaction of changes in relative wages and in occupational
employment shares. Both calculations imply that polarization has strongly increased inequality,
whereas compression of the distribution of wages across broad occupations has worked to reduce
inequality. This result— between-occupation wage compression with reallocation of hours across
occupations that increases overall wage inequality— is consistent with …ndings in Charnoz, Coudin,
and Gaini (2013) and Verdugo (2014), as discussed above in Section 1.1.

3.3

Trade exposure of occupations

A key question in understanding job polarization is: how exposed are workers to the forces that
are potentially driving polarization? Because we have data that matches …rms and trade, we can
construct measures of …rm-level exposure of di¤erent occupations to imports and exports— measures
28

This measure is equivalent to the weighted coe¢ cient of variation, and has the virtue of being scale independent,
and thus invariant to general trends in nominal wages (see Cowell (2008)). We splice the wot =wt series between 2001
and 2002, as described in the appendix.

18

which have not been calculated before in the literature. To construct these measures, we allocate
…rm-level exports xf t to workers within the …rm, by occupation, and then sum across …rms to get
economy-wide measures of occupational export exposure,
Xot =

X

xf t sf ot ;

(4)

f

where sf ot is the share of occupation o hours in …rm f hours. We then divide Xot by aggregate
exports Xt to give the share of aggregate exports allocated to occupation o. We de…ne Mot ; imports
allocated to occupation o, similarly. The scale of the occupational trade shares are not particularly
meaningful, so we report occupational trade shares relative to the occupation’s share of aggregate
hours Sot , with the ratios averaged over time.29 Thus, in Figure 7, workers in occupations with
exposure greater than one are more exposed than the average worker to trade.
Figure 7 shows great variation in exposure to trade by occupation. Import and export exposure
are correlated, which re‡ects the well-known fact that …rms that trade tend to both import and
export; e.g., see Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007). The most trade-exposed occupations
are Upper Managers (PCS 37) and Techies (PCS 38 and 47). Highly skilled industrial workers (PCS
62) are very exposed to trade, particularly to exports, and the same is true for Supervisors (PCS
48). What this means is that these workers are concentrated in …rms which export and, to a lesser
extent, import. Interestingly, the less-skilled industrial workers (PCS 67) are only slightly more
exposed to exports, and no more exposed to imports, than the average worker.
In contrast, manual laborers (PCS 63 and 68), retail workers (PCS 55), drivers (PCS 64), and
especially personal service workers (PCS 56) are comparatively unexposed to trade. To a lesser
extent, the same is true for o¢ ce workers (PCS 54), the largest occupation in the economy in 1994.
There are two important caveats in interpreting these numbers. First, the trade exposure
indices treat all workers in a …rm as equally exposed to the …rm’s trade. Second, the indices re‡ect
only direct …rm-level exposure to trade, and do not account for any exposure to trade that comes
through competition in product markets. We address the causal e¤ects of …rm-level trade exposure
in our econometric analysis below.
29

There is very little time series variation in relative occupational exposure to trade, so we report the time-averages
for simplicity.

19

3.4

Techie exposure of occupations

Our working hypothesis is that techies are a key channel that translate falling ICT prices into
changes in the …rm level occupation mix. An implication is that …rms with more techies may see
greater ICT-enabled changes in occupational mix. As a step toward measuring this e¤ect, in this
section we introduce measures of occupational exposure: what share of workers overall, and by
occupation, work in …rms with techies? The short answer is that more than half of all workers are
exposed to techies, and that exposure to techies varies a lot across occupations. We also report
exposure of workers to other occupations.
To begin, we compute the share of hours that occur in …rms that employ occupation o. This
measure of overall exposure to occupation o is given by
P
dof t hf t
f
P
;
hf t
f

where dof t is an indicator equal to 1 if …rm f has at least one hour paid by occupation o and hf t
is total hours in …rm f . This share includes exposure of occupation o workers to themselves, so we
also compute a measure that excludes this own-exposure,
P
dof t (hf t hof t )
f
P
:
hf t
f

To get a clearer picture of how occupations interact at the …rm level, we also compute occupationby-occupation exposure,

P
f

dof t ho0 f t
P
:
ho0 f t
f

The result of computing occupation-by-occupation exposure is a non-symmetric square matrix,
where each row gives the exposure of occupation o0 to all other occupations o. The diagonal
elements are 1 by de…nition, while the o¤-diagonal elements answer the question: what share of
hours in occupation o0 (rows) are worked in …rms that also employ occupation o (columns)?
The occupational exposure measures do not change much over time, so we report results for a
single year, 2002, in Table 5. The …rst two rows report overall exposure, excluding and including
an occupations’ exposure to itself. Focusing on the column for PCS 38, technical managers and
engineers, Table 5 shows that 55 percent of hours paid in the economy were in …rms that also had

20

hours in this techie occupation (the number rises to 60 percent including PCS 38 exposure to itself).
The corresponding number for PCS 47, technicians, is 56 percent. Moving down the column labeled
38, we see great heterogeneity in exposure to technical managers: 77 percent for top managers (PCS
37), and only 21 percent for personal service workers (PCS 56). The highest exposure is for skilled
industrial workers (PCS 62, 83 percent), with very high exposure for low-skilled industrial workers
as well (PCS 67, 77 percent). The biggest occupation in the economy, o¢ ce workers (PCS 54), is
less exposed than average to technical managers, with just over half of o¢ ce workers sharing a …rm
with a technical manager. Not surprisingly, the two techie occupations are very highly exposed to
each other, at 86 percent for both. Other occupations’exposure to the two techie occupations is
quite similar (to see this, compare the columns labeled 38 and 47).

4

Techies and polarization: an illustration

The heterogeneity across occupations of exposure to techies shown in Table 5 is further motivation
for our hypothesis that techies are a channel through which falling ICT prices cause polarization.
In this section we show this channel theoretically, with a simple model of …rm-level outcomes. The
model shows how a drop in the price of ICT can lead to polarization of employment within a …rm,
and shows how polarization depends on parameters of the …rm’s technology. The model also shows
how a drop in the price of ICT can lead to greater employment growth in ICT-intensive …rms.
These results help to motivate our within and between-…rm econometric analyses in the following
sections. Proofs of all statements are in the appendix.

A key parameter in the technology just described is , the distributional parameter associated

with ICT services in the functions H
of ICT services in total cost is increasing in ). How does cross-sectional variation in

employment equations with respect to , which gives

is associated with lower employment relative to L. The reason is that

as the importance of ICT in producing high and medium-skill tasks rises, the labor that is required
to work with ICT capital falls. Since there is no direct e¤ect of
ratios H=L and M=L decline with . The e¤ect of

Polarization with falling ICT prices

We next turn to the e¤ect of falling ICT prices on relative employment within …rms. A drop in r
leads to a polarization in employment, with H rising relative to M and L; and M falling relative
to H and L,

The intuition is straightforward: since ICT is a complement to H but a substitute for M , a drop

We now turn to a key question which helps motivate our empirical speci…cation below: is the
polarizing e¤ect of falling r stronger within …rms where ICT is more important? Mathematically,

negative? Intuition suggests yes, and we show in the appendix that

is negative for most of the relevant regions of the parameter space.

We illustrate the forces at work with a numerical example. In the example we normalize the
wage of the least skilled workers to 1, and set wM = 2 and wH = 3: The elasticities of substitution
are

= 2 and

= 1=2, and the upper-level cost shares ;

are equalized at 1=3. We drop the cost

of ICT r from 11 to 1, and analyze how the resulting ratio H=M varies as a function of

2 [0; 1].

The …gure below, a contour plot of the level of H=M , illustrates what we …nd. The vertical axis

levels of H=M are at the upper right of the …gure, shaded blue, with higher levels of H=M shading
toward orange. Moving from the top to the bottom of the …gure illustrates our analytical result
that a drop in r leads to an increase in H=M , as ICT services complement H and substitute for
M . This increase is steeper for higher levels of : the more important ICT is in the production
function, the greater the polarizing e¤ect of a drop in r (to see this, note that when more contour

Techies and competitiveness

We now turn to the between-…rm e¤ect of falling computer prices. While a drop in the price of
computers r bene…ts all …rms that employ ICT services by lowering their unit costs b (@b=@r > 0
when

> 0), …rms that are more ICT-intensive (higher ) bene…t more:
@2b
>0:
@r@

This means that, following a drop in r, ICT-intensive …rms become relatively more cost competitive,
and under any plausible demand system this will lead to market-share gains for ICT-intensive …rms.
There are three e¤ects of falling r on the total demand for labor in high- …rms relative to
low- …rms. The …rst is the just-mentioned competitiveness e¤ect, which will raise the relative
output of high- …rms. The second e¤ect is the substitution e¤ect of ICT for medium-skilled labor
M , and the third is the complementary e¤ect of ICT on high-skilled labor H. The net e¤ect on
total employment of the substitution and complementarity e¤ects is ambiguous, so the e¤ect of
ICT-intensity on employment growth is an empirical matter, which we investigate in Section 5
below.
To summarize, a fall in r will lead to an increase in aggregate demand for H relative to M
through a within-…rm channel, and possibly through a between-…rm channel. The within-…rm
e¤ect is due to substitution of H for M within …rms, and the between-…rm e¤ect is due to the
increasing competitiveness of high- …rms.

Imports and exports

The model above is silent on globalization as an in‡uence on the level and composition of employment. Rather than incorprate imports and exports formally into the model, we discuss this
much-studied issue informally here.
Feenstra and Hanson (1996) seem to have been the …rst to show how purchases of imported
intermediates (o¤shoring) can a¤ect the skill composition of employment. More recently, Acemoglu
and Autor (2011) showed how o¤shoring can contribute to …rm-level polarization. These and related
analyses make the point that o¤shoring has competing e¤ects on total …rm-level employment:
a direct substitution e¤ect of imported intermediates for workers within the …rm, and a costreducing e¤ect that can raise demand for workers whose jobs are not o¤shored.30 We estimate
30

Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) show how this second e¤ect may or may not dominate in general equilibrium.

25

these polarization and net employment e¤ects in our econometric analysis below.
A large empirical literature— reviewed by Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007)— …nds
that exporting is associated with higher skill intensity in cross-sections of …rms. We know of no
theoretical or empirical analysis of the link between exporting and …rm-level employment, perhaps
because the …rst-order e¤ect is too obvious: …rms that also sell abroad will tend to have greater
labor demand than those who sell only at home. In our econometric analysis below we look for
such …rm-level employment e¤ects both within and between French …rms.

Econometric analysis of between-…rm di¤erences in employment
growth

In this section we ask: what accounts for di¤erences across …rms in employment growth? The
discussion in the previous section suggests that both globalization and technological change are important causal factors, and the purpose of our econometric analysis is to quantify their importance.

5.1

Estimating equations

Optimal …rm-level employment depends on both demand and cost conditions. We specify optimal
employment in logs for …rm f in year t as
ln hf t =

characteristics is given by
k k xkf t . The list of …rm characteristics xkf t includes techies and
trade indicators, as well as other …rm characteristics which we can not measure, such as capital,

We model the …rm-speci…c time trend Df as a function of the level of the techie share and
trade in time t

1. Firms that do not trade at all, and/or that have no techies at all, are likely

to be distinctly di¤erent from …rms that do trade and/or have techies, so to accommodate this we
allow techies and trade to enter Df non-linearly. To control for the well-established fact that …rm

summarizes the Df function. The rationale for this speci…cation is that there

are industry and/or economy-wide trends in ICT prices and globalization that will a¤ect …rms’
employment growth di¤erentially through …rms’ initial levels of techies and trade. For example,
a …rm with a large techie share will be more responsive to falling IT prices than a …rm that has
few techies, as in the model of Section 4 above. Similarly, a …rm that exports …nal goods or
purchases imported inputs will be more a¤ected by the increased integration of Eastern Europe,
China, and India into the world economy than will a …rm that does not trade. Thus, equation
(6) allows us to estimate the heterogeneous e¤ect of aggregate trends on …rm outcomes, where the
heterogeneity is captured by …rm characteristics in the initial period. With industry …xed e¤ects

The speci…cation in (6) has the feature that the marginal e¤ects of techies and trade are constant.
This is potentially restrictive, since (for example) the e¤ect of techies might depend on whether
or not a …rm trades (and vice versa). To allow for this possibility, we also estimate a speci…cation

Firm-level imports are likely to have di¤erent e¤ects on employment growth depending on what
goods are imported. For example, imports of capital goods or …nal goods that are complementary
in demand to the goods produced by a …rm (Bernard, Blanchard, Van Beveren, and Vandenbussche
(2012)) may boost employment, while o¤shoring (imports of parts and other intermediates) may
reduce employment growth. To allow for these di¤erences, we also report estimates that break
down imports by intermediate/…nal and by source country.
When we estimate (6) and (7) we use growth rates instead of log di¤erences on the left hand
side. This has virtually no e¤ect on the results, but it has the advantage of making statements
about aggregate employment growth more straightforward. In unreported results, we estimated
other non-linear speci…cations for the Df function, for example by using indicators for terciles
or quartiles of exports f t

1

and imports f t

1

instead of their values. These deliver very similar

magnitudes of the economic e¤ect on …rm employment growth. In other words, the main source of
non-linearity is the extensive zero/positive margin; once we control for this, further non-linearity
is much less important.
Our estimating equations are similar to models estimated by Autor and Dorn (2013) and
Beaudry, Doms, and Lewis (2010). In Beaudry et al., the authors show that city-level variation in
the adoption of PC technology is caused by predetermined city-level di¤erences in the abundance
of highly educated labor. Similarly, Autor and Dorn (2013) show that labor markets with higher
levels of “routineness" see larger increases in low-wage service employment. Both of these papers
use lagged levels as instruments for levels in the 1980s. A contribution of our approach is that
we locate the e¤ects of technology adoption in …rms, which is where choices about technology are
made, rather than in industries or regions.

28

5.2

Estimation methodology

Estimation of equations (6) and (7) by least squares is unlikely to be consistent for two reasons:
endogeneity of the included right hand side variables, and correlation of the included right hand
side variables with relevant omitted variables. Here we describe our instrumental variables strategy
that delivers a consistent estimator of (6) and (7) in the face of these issues, and we discuss potential
threats to the internal validity of our IV approach.
Our data cover the 14 years 1994 to 2007. As noted above, there are some small discontinuities
in the hours shares between 2001 and 2002 due to a change in data processing of the DADS.
Consequently, we estimate equations (6) and (7) on the 5 year period 2002 to 2007. The left hand
side variable is the growth rate of …rm hours between 2002 and 2007, and the initial levels of techies,
trade and employment on the right hand side are measured in 2002. Because our data goes back to
1994, we use lagged levels of techies, trade and employment from 1994 to 1998 as instruments for
the levels in 2002 (our choice of which years to use as instruments is discussed below). We estimate
(6) and (7) separately for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing …rms.
Our estimation sample consists of a balanced panel of the 310,713 French private sector …rms
that have positive hours in each year from 1994 to 2007. We refer to these as “permanent …rms".
Thus, …rm entry and exit is not relevant to our estimation strategy. These 310,713 …rms, 85%
of whose hours are in nonmanufacturing, account for about half of private sector hours in each
year, and they are somewhat larger than the average …rm, both in terms of total hours and in the
average number of occupations per …rm. Figure 8 illustrates the di¤erences between the French
private sector as a whole and our estimation sample of permanent …rms. For most occupations, the
di¤erences are small and stable over time, and the exceptions are small occupations. In particular,
the trends are virtually the same. Figure 9 shows that overall changes in hours shares and the
within-between split are similar for permanent …rms and those that are active for a subset of the
sample ("temporary …rms").
5.2.1

Instrument validity

As with any IV strategy, consistency requires that the lagged independent variables satisfy two
requirements: they must be strong (correlated with the included endogenous variables) and exogenous (uncorrelated with the composite error term uf t ). We address these requirements here, but in
summary: our instruments are undoubtedly strong, but there are some concerns about exogeneity.

29

Choice of instruments.

Since our estimation period begins in 2002, while the sample begins in

1994, we potentially have eight lags, 1994 to 2001, of the dependent variables to use as instruments.
This raises two distinct questions. The …rst is, how many lags are exogenous? The second question
is, if all the lags are exogenous, how many should be used as instruments? This second question
is motivated by the fact that even if all eight lags are valid instruments, there is the potential for
…nite sample bias due to the “many instruments" problem (see Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995)
for an illustration).
To answer the question about how many instruments are valid, we implement a sequence of
“di¤erence-in-Sargan" tests, also known as C tests.32 We assume that the 1994 lag is a valid
instrument, and we then sequentially add more recent lags (1995, 1996, etc.). The incremental
increase in the usual overidenti…cation Sargan test statistic is distributed as a

2 ,
m

where m is the

number of added instruments, which is 7 in our case. The null hypothesis is that the additional
instruments are valid, conditional on the previous ones being valid. Failure to reject the null at each
increment is taken as evidence for the validity of the added instruments. The results indicate that
in nonmanufacturing no more than six lags, including 1994–1999, should be used; in manufacturing
the procedure indicates no more than four lags, including 1994–1997, should be used.33
Importantly, the lag for which the C stat exeeds conventional critical values is also the lag
that is the …rst to have a Hansen J statistic that exeeds conventional critical values. This is not
generally true, but in our case it is. This implies that the overidenti…cation test is not rejected at
standard levels of signi…cance for six lags in nonmanufacturing and for four lags in manufacturing.
In manufacturing, using …ve lags from 1994 to 1998 gives a p-value for the J test of 0:03.34 This is
particularly reassuring, because it implies that as a set, lags 1994–1998 can be considered exogenous
a priori. We chose …ve lags in both sectors for symmetry.35
To answer the question about how many valid instruments to use, we use the procedure proposed
by Donald and Newey (2001). The purpose of the Donald-Newey procedure is to select the most
e¢ cient set of instruments, and the procedure involves minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of
a weighted average of the estimates of interest, relative to a benchmark estimate.36 Our benchmark
32

Convenient references for the “di¤erence-in-Sargan" test include Hayashi (2000), pages 218–221 and 232–234,
and Ruud (2000), Chapter 22.
33
These results are available upon request.
34
Adding 1999 and 2000 lags increases the p-value somewhat to 0.06.
35
These results are available upon request.
36
Of the two minimum MSE crieria proposed by Donald and Newey (2001), we use the Mallows criteria, which
proves to be more robust in practice. We consider the simple average of the MSE criterion across the six elements of
interest in .

30

uses only the 1994 lags of X. When we add lags of X sequentially and compare the MSE to that
of using only 1994, we …nd that the minimum MSE is attained with six lags in nonmanufacturing
and seven lags in manufacturing, which includes 1999 or 2000, respectively.
To summarize, our two procedures give slightly di¤erent answers, with the di¤erence-in-Sargan
procedure suggesting using 1994–1998 lags and the Donald-Newey procedure suggesting an additional year or two. We choose to be conservative, and thus proceed by using the 1994–1998 lags as
our set of instruments in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors.
Are the instruments strong?

The most common test statistic of the null of weak instruments

is the …rst stage F -statistic, where the critical values are somewhat larger than the standard
tabulation of the F distribution would indicate (Staiger and Stock (1997)). As discussed by Stock
and Yogo (2005), the econometric theory of testing for weak instruments when there is more than
one endogenous regressor is challenging, and results only exist for the case of up to three endogenous
regressors (see Table 1 in Stock and Yogo (2005)). Since our application includes seven endogenous
regressors, there is no econometric theory available to guide the choice of critical values for a …rst
stage F statistic. As an alternative, we report Shea (1997)’s partial R2 . Shea’s statistic, along
with other measures of …rst stage goodness-of-…t, has been criticized because it lacks a foundation
in distribution theory, but it has two key virtues: it is easy to interpret, and it is well de…ned for
an arbitrary number of endogenous variables. The Shea partial R2 s for equation (6) are reported
in Table 6, and the results leave no question that the …rst stage is strong.
Are the instruments excludable? An implication of exogeneity is that the instruments must
be excludeable, i.e. not relevant except through their in‡uence on the endogenous regressors. We
conduct a speci…cation test that addresses this implication. Our procedure is to add the 1998 lag
of techies, trade, and employment to (6), using lags from 1994 to 1997 as instruments. We then
test the null hypothesis that the coe¢ cients on the 1998 levels are jointly zero. The question being
asked by this procedure is: once we have controlled for 2002 levels of techies and trade, is there
any extra explanatory power from the 1998 levels? This null cannot be rejected, which leads us to
proceed in assuming that the exclusion restrictions for lags from 1994 to 1998 are valid.
Are the instruments exogenous? For the instruments to be exogenous, they must be uncorrelated with the composite error term uit in (6). Recall that uit includes both changes in …rm
characteristics xkf t and changes in the error term "f t in (5). Thus our identifying assumption is

31

that …ve year changes in the xkf t ’s and the error term "f t are uncorrelated with four to eight year
lags of the levels of techies and trade.
We can directly test part of our exogeneity assumptions, because 2002–2007 changes in techies
and trade are among the changes in …rm characteristics included in uit , and we have data on these
changes. As a test of the null hypothesis that these observable changes are uncorrelated with the
instruments, we regress 2002–2007 changes in techies and trade on the full set of instruments. The
explanatory power of these regressions is near zero: the regressions’R2 ’s are tiny, and F tests fail
to reject the null of no linear relationship.
While reassuring, these regression tests of instrument exogeneity fail to address potential correlation between the instruments and changes in unobservable …rm characteristics such as revenue
or capital and intermediates intensity. However, given the very low correlation between changes
and lagged levels in the variables we do observe, it seems reasonable to expect that the correlation
between changes in di¤erent variables and our instruments would also be small.
An additional concern is endogeneity in the instruments due to serial correlation in the error
term "f t in (5). It is likely that the errors are contemporaneously correlated with the xkf t ’s, so
serial correlation in "f t implies possible correlation between "f t and the lagged xkf t ’s that we use
as instruments. However, since it is

"f t rather than "f t that enters our estimating equation (6),

what matters for the exogeneity of our instruments is possible correlation between

"f t and the

lagged xkf t ’s. In the appendix we show that although serial correlation in "f t does give rise to bias,
this bias is likely to be small.
We have just argued that the above issues are likely to be minor threats to the exogeneity of
our instruments. A more serious concern is omitted variables in initial period levels in equation
(6), i.e. misspeci…cation of Df . Potentially important omitted variables include other …rm inputs
such as capital, materials, and domestic outsourcing. If the omitted variables in levels are both
contemporaneously correlated with our regressors and correlated over time, then they may be
correlated with our instruments. We regard this possibility as the most serious threat to the
exogeneity of our instruments, and we can not test this or rule it out a priori.
Table 7 reports p-values for two standard diagnostic tests for 2SLS estimation of equation (6).
The rows labeled “Endogeneity,

2 (7)"

test the null hypothesis that OLS is a consistent estimator

using a Hausman test, while the rows labeled "Overid,

32

2 (28)"

test the null hypothesis that the

instruments are valid using Hansen’s J test.37 We reject the consistency of OLS at any conventional
level of statistical signi…cance. As mentioned above, in nonmanufacturing the Hansen J test is not
rejected, while in manufacturing it is, but only once we add the lag 1998 and at the 3% level of
signi…cance.
The purpose of the discussion above is to argue that while our instruments are imperfect, 2SLS
is likely to have smaller bias than OLS, so we proceed accordingly.
5.2.2

Weighting

The unit of observation in our data is a …rm, but our research question concerns aggregate employment. Since the distribution of employment across …rms is highly skewed, unweighted regression
analysis of (6) would weight tiny …rms the same as huge …rms, which would give a distorted picture
of the e¤ect of techies and trade on employment polarization. To avoid this, our estimator weights
…rm observations by total …rm hours in 2002. The resulting estimates have the usual interpretation
as estimated conditional means, where the conditional expectation is taken over the distribution of
hours rather than the distribution of …rms. Our practice of weighting by employment is standard
in the literature on inequality and polarization, see for example Michaels, Natraj, and Van Reenen
(2014) and Autor and Dorn (2013).
5.2.3

Summary of estimation strategy

Here we summarize our estimation strategy for equations (6) and (7). We estimate two regressions,
one for nonmanufacturing …rms and the other for manufacturing …rms. The dependent variable
is growth in hours in 2002–2007. The explanatory variables are levels of techies (share of hours),
trade (imports and exports, scaled by total …rm wage bill), and log hours in 2002. The estimator is
weighted two stage least squares, where the instruments are lagged techies, trade, and log hours in
1994–1998. We weight observations by …rm hours in 2002. Finally, we compute heteroskedasticity
robust covariance matrices.

5.3

Estimation results

The estimated parameters of equations (6) and (7) do not directly address our research questions.38
Here we focus on two questions:
37
There are seven degrees of freedom for the Hausman test because there are seven endogenous variables in (6).
With …ve lags of the seven dependent variables, we have 35 instruments, which is why there are 28 degrees of freedom
for the J test.
38
The estimate parameters are reported in the Appendix.

33

1. What is the e¤ect of an increase from zero to the median of the explanatory variable on the
growth in hours? We call this the extensive margin e¤ ect.
2. What is the e¤ect of an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the explanatory
variable on the growth in hours? We call this the intensive margin e¤ ect.
We scale both estimated e¤ects by the 75th -25th percentile range (also called the interquartile
range or IQR) of the growth in hours.39 Computing these e¤ects involves calculating the estimated
conditional mean at two di¤erent points, and then looking at the di¤erence. For equation (6), the
formulas for the extensive and intensive margin e¤ects of techies are, respectively,
extensive_techies =

intensive_techies =

b1

b2 + b1

p50 (techies)
p75 ( hf t ) p25 ( hf t )

(8)

[p75 (techies) p25 (techies)]
p75 ( hf t ) p25 ( hf t )

(9)

where pN (x) is the N th percentile of variable x. Analogous de…nitions apply to the intensive
and extensive margin e¤ects of imports and exports. To understand the scale of these unit-free
measures, suppose that the estimated extensive margin e¤ect of techies is 0.6. This means that an
increase from zero to the median value of techies increases expected employment growth by 60%
of its interquartile range (IQR). Similarly, an intensive margin e¤ect of techies of -0.4 means that
a one IQR change in techies causes an expected reduction of employment growth equal to 40% of
its IQR. In short, the e¤ects we report are similar to elasticities.
The interaction e¤ects estimated in equation (7) permit us to re…ne the above questions. In
particular, we can ask: what are the intensive and extensive margin e¤ects of techies for …rms that
trade and those who do not trade? Similarly, what are the intensive and extensive margin e¤ects
of imports and exports for …rms with and without techies? As with the simpler formulas given by
(8) and (9), the formulas for the di¤erences in conditional means involve both parameter estimates
and percentiles of the data. The somewhat involved expressions for these e¤ects are relegated to
the appendix. Brie‡y, techie interaction e¤ects are evaluated at the median value of exports and
imports over their strictly positive range. This means that the e¤ect of techies among trading …rms
is evaluated for a …rm with the median level of trade. Similarly, exports and imports interaction
e¤ects are evaluated at the median value of techies over it strictly positive range. This means that
the e¤ect of trade among techie-intensive …rms is evaluated for a …rm with the median level of
39

When we compute the intensive and extensive margin e¤ects we use the percentiles of the distribution of strictly
positive values for the explanatory variables.

34

techies. Tables 8 and 9 report the size of relevant subsamples of …rms by techie and trade status.40
5.3.1

Techies cause faster employment growth, especially in manufacturing

The e¤ect of techies are reported in Panel A of Table 10, …rst for all …rms (columns 1 and 2) and
then for …rms divided into those who do and do not trade (columns 3 through 6). Statistically
signi…cantly e¤ects are shaded, and standard errors are reported in italics.41
The …rst number in Table 10, 0.344, means that nonmanufacturing …rms with the median
techie share saw signi…cantly faster employment growth than …rms without techies. At one
third of the interquartile range (IQR) of employment growth, this is an economically large
e¤ect. The extensive techie e¤ect for nonmanufacturing …rms is the same for …rms that do
not trade (column 3, almost 60% of employment within nonmanufacturing), and there is also
a smaller 0.15 intensive margin e¤ect for these …rms (column 4). For nonmanufacturing …rms
that trade (column 5) the extensive margin e¤ect is not signi…cant, and there is a negative
intensive margin e¤ect (column 6).
Techies have a strong e¤ect on manufacturing employment growth, with an extensive margin
e¤ect of 0.94 and a smaller, but still important, intensive margin e¤ect of 0.22 (columns 1
and 2). The extensive margin e¤ect is particularly strong for …rms that do not trade (column
3), and is positive but not signi…cant for …rms that do trade (column 5). The fact that
the extensive margin e¤ect of techies is imprecisely estimated for …rms that trade is due to
the fact that almost all trading …rms employ techies (see Table 8). But variation in techie
intensity within manufacturing …rms that trade has an intensive margin e¤ect of 0.26.
Overall, Panel A of Table 10 shows that …rms that employed more techies in 2002— both at the
extensive and the intesive margins— saw much faster employment growth from 2002 to 2007. This
result is consistent with our theoretical prediction in Section 4, where we illustrated that falling
ICT prices raise the competitiveness of …rms that employ techies.
5.3.2

Trade a¤ects employment growth

The overall e¤ects of importing and exporting on employment growth are reported in Panel B of
Table 10, …rst for all …rms (columns 1, 2, 5 and 6) and then for …rms divided into those who do and
40

Because …rms that only import or only export comprise such a small share of hours worked (16 percent of hours in
nonmanufacturing, 9 percent in manufacturing) and of trade (10 percent of trade in nonmanufacturing, 1 percent in
manufacturing), we do not report the estimated e¤ects for these …rms. Complete results are available upon request.
41
That is, estimates with 90% con…dence intervals that exclude zero are shaded.

35

do not employ techies (columns 3, 4, 7, and 8). All but one of the estimated e¤ects are statistically
insigni…cant, and the one signi…cant e¤ect is trivially small.
The empirical literature on o¤shoring suggests (e.g., Biscourp and Kramarz (2007)) that it
is important to distinguish between intermediate inputs and other imports, and among country
sources of imports. To do this we estimate versions of equation (6) that disaggregate trade, …rst by
including an indicator for imports of intermediate goods and second by disaggregating imports by
source country (high income countries according to World Bank classi…cation in 2002, China, and
all other countries). These import measures enter the regression as in all our other speci…cations,
as intensity (value divided by total gross wage bill) and as an indicator for positive values.
The results from these speci…cations are reported in Table 11. The …rst two columns repeat
the “overall" estimates from Panel B of Table 10. Columns 3 and 4 report estimates when we add
regressors that capture intermediate inputs. In this speci…cation the e¤ect of importing intermediate
inputs is incremental, over and above importing per se. Columns 5 and 6 disaggregate by sources
of imports. Our …ndings are:
Column 3 shows that for manufacturing …rms, importing per se has a statistically insigni…cant
positive extensive margin e¤ect, but the extensive margin of imports of intermediates is large
and negative, at -0.8. The negative employment growth e¤ects of importing intermediate
inputs (that is, o¤shoring) is suggestive of a simple substitution e¤ect of foreign for domestic
low-skilled labor, which is also what we …nd in Table 17 below. We thus …nd no evidence of a
…rm-level productivity e¤ect of o¤shoring that o¤sets the labor substitution e¤ect, as seen in
the models of Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) and Rodriguez-Clare (2010). The e¤ects
of importing in nonmanufacturing are always virtually nil.
When distinguishing imports by source country (columns 5 and 6), we still …nd that the
e¤ects are insigni…cant for nonmanufacturing …rms. But the story for manufacturing …rms is
strikingly di¤erent: the overall insigni…cant e¤ect found in column 1 is evidently hiding large
negative e¤ects from lower income countries (-0.1 but insigni…cant from China and -0.43 from
other), combined with a zero e¤ect for imports from rich countries. This is consistent with
the idea that o¤shoring to lower income countries reduces employment growth by substituting
imported intermediate inputs for labor.
Exporting has no detectable e¤ect on employment growth in any speci…cation, except in
nonmanufacturing in column 3, but this is not stable across speci…cations.

36

Overall, our results in Tables 17 and 11 support a conclusion that o¤shoring reduces …rm
employment growth, and leads to skill upgrading within blue collar workers. In addition, it is
striking how stable the techie e¤ects are, especially in manufacturing, across all import speci…cation.

Econometric analysis of within-…rm changes in occupational
structure

In this section we ask: what explains changes in the occupational structure within French …rms,
and how did this contribute to job polarization? Our hypothesis is that both globalization and
technological change are important causal factors, and the purpose of our econometric analysis is
to quantify their importance. We measure changes in a …rm’s occupational structure by changes
in the share of hours in one of twelve major PCS occupations, excluding the share of techies (PCS
38 and 47). Changes in this “ex-techie" share are explained by …rm-level measures of exposure to
globalization (imports and exports as a share of the …rm’s wage bill) and technology (the share of
techies in total …rm hours).

6.1

Estimating equations and estimation methodology

Our estimation approach here is very similar to the approach in section 5, so we move quickly.
The …rm-occupation outcome measure of interest is the ex-techie share of hours of the twelve large
non-techie occupations listed in Table 2. For each occupation o, our estimating equation is
sf ot =

o
i

+

o

Xf t

1

+ uof t :

(10)

where X includes the same regressors as in equations (6) and (7) with the exception of log total
hours.42 The estimator is again weighted 2SLS, where the weights are 2002 hours. The issues of
instrument strength and validity are the same as before. The same instrument selection procedure
used above still leads us to use lags from 1994–1998 as instruments. Table 13 reports p-values for
the Hausman endogeneity tests and Hansen’s J tests of the overidentifying restrictions. Table 12
shows that the …rst stage is strong. We estimate (10) for each occupation o that comprised at least
three percent of hours in 2002, separately for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing.
One additional econometric issue is censoring. Firms choose their mix of occupations optimally,
and corner solutions are common: few if any …rms employ workers in all occupations in every
42

Overall, the estimates of regressions when we include log total hours as a regressor (and instrument for it
accordingly) tell a similar story as the results reported in the paper. This is because in almost all speci…cations …rm
size has no e¤ect on the outcome variable. These results are available upon request.

37

year, and the (weighted) median number of occupations per …rm-year is 10.43 This means that
the sample size when estimating (10) varies by PCS code.44 If corner solutions in occupational
hours are nonrandom and correlated with observables, which is likely, then OLS is inconsistent.
Rather than trying to model sample selection, which is neither feasible nor relevant to our research
question, we rely on our instruments to correct for the inconsistency due to sample selection.

6.2

Estimation results

As in Section 5, we report scaled e¤ects rather than regression coe¢ cients45 . Since the sample
changes for each occupation, percentiles that are needed for deriving these scaled e¤ects are computed separately for each occupation in the corresponding sample. Tables 14 through 17 report
our results.46 Rows are occupation-speci…c regression results. The Overall e¤ects in columns (1)
and (2) of Tables 14 through 17 are functions of the data and the estimated parameters of our
baseline speci…cation, equation (10). The remaining columns are functions of the data and the
estimated parameters of the interaction speci…cation, which is similar to equation (7). Statistically
signi…cantly e¤ects are shaded, and standard errors are reported in italics.47
6.2.1

Techies cause within-…rm skill upgrading in nonmanufacturing

Turning …rst to the estimates for nonmanufacturing …rms (over 85% of private sector employment),
the Overall results in Table 14 show that techies have a large positive e¤ect on within-…rm skill
upgrading:
Firms with more techies increase the share of top managers (PCS 37), and the e¤ect is
large and statistically signi…cantly. The extensive margin e¤ect, which compares a …rm with
no techies to one with a median techie share, is that the latter di¤erentially increases the
managerial share of hours by 34% of the interquartile range (IQR). Turning to the intensive
margin e¤ect among …rms with techies, the e¤ect of a one IQR higher techie share is to raise
the managerial share by a …fth of its IQR.
Among other white collar workers, the intensive margin e¤ect of techies is to cause modest
skill upgrading: middle-management jobs increase their shares (PCS 46, e¤ect is +0.048)
43
More precisely, 10 is the weighted median, with weights equal to total …rm hours in the permanent-private
subsample of …rms used in our regression analysis. The weighted median is 12 for manufacturing …rms, and 9 for
nonmanufacturing …rms.
44
When sf ot = sf ot 1 = 0, we treat the change sf ot as unde…ned, and …rm f is not included in the estimation
sample for occupation o.
45
Regression coe¢ cients are reported in the appendix.
46
For each sector, we include estimates only for occupations that amounted to at least 3 percent of hours in 2002.
47
That is, estimates with 90% con…dence intervals that exclude zero are shaded.

38

while low-paid o¢ ce and retail occupations shrink (the e¤ect for O¢ ce Workers PCS 54 is
-0.055, and for Retail Workers PCS 55 it is -0.15).
The share of the lowest-paid occupation, low-skill manual workers (PCS 68), grew much more
slowly in …rms with techies, with an extensive margin e¤ect of -0.67. The intensive margin
e¤ect of -0.20, while smaller, is also economically important.
By contrast, the extensive margin e¤ect of 1.46 for highly paid skilled industrial workers (PCS
62) is large and positive: …rms with the median number of techies saw their share of PCS 62
increase much faster than …rms with no techies.48
The …nal 4 columns of Table 14 shows how the e¤ects of techies varies with …rm’s trading status:
For …rms that do not trade (58 percent of hours in nonmanufacturing), the extensive margin
e¤ect of techies on top manager growth (PCS 37) is half of the IQR for this occupation’s
share growth for these …rms. There are no statistically signi…cant e¤ects for other white
collar occupations (PCs 46 to 56), but there is a strong skill upgrading e¤ect within blue
collar workers, particularly along the extensive margin: techies cause faster growth for skilled
industrial workers (PCS 62, +1.4) and slower growth for low-skill manual laborers (PCS 68,
-0.7).
For …rms that both import and export (26 percent of hours), the extensive margin e¤ects
of techies in column 5 are largely unidenti…ed, which is a consequence of the fact that over
90 percent of hours among this group of …rms are in …rms with techies (see Table 8). The
intensive margin e¤ects in column 6 generally line up with the overall intensive margin e¤ects
reported in column 2.
6.2.2

Techies cause within-…rm skill polarization in manufacturing

Table 15 shows that rather than causing skill upgrading as they do in nonmanufacturing, techies in
manufacturing cause skill polarization within manufacturing …rms. The channels are mainly along
the extensive margin, and are somewhat di¤erent among …rms that trade and those that do not:
Among …rms that trade (78 percent of hours in manufacturing) polarization occurs along
the extensive margin, with middle managers growing faster (PCS 46, +0.6) and both clerical
o¢ ce workers (PCS 54, -0.9) and similarly paid middle-wage skilled manual workers (PCS 63,
-2.9) reducing their shares within …rms.
48

Despite our short-hand description of PCS 62 as “skilled industrial workers", this occupation comprised more
than 4 percent of hours worked in nonmanufacturing in 2002 (see Table 3), mainly in construction.

39

Within non-trading …rms (14 percent), the extensive margin polarization e¤ect of techies was
even sharper. In …rms with techies, top and middle managers grew faster (PCS 37, +0.8 and
PCS 46, +0.5) while within blue collar industrial workers techies caused skill downgrading,
with skilled industrial workers growing much more slowly (PCS 62, -1.3) and low-skill blue
collar workers growing faster (PCS 67, +1.5). The e¤ect for clerical workers is also negative
(PCS 54, -0.5) though not statistically signi…cant.
6.2.3

Trade a¤ects within-…rm skill mix, mostly in manufacturing

Tables 16 and 17 show that trade also a¤ects the within-…rm occupational mix, but mainly in manufacturing. Overall, trade has small and mainly statistically insigni…cant e¤ects on the occupational
mix within nonmanufacturing …rms. However,
Importing causes …rms to increase their share of drivers and the e¤ect is large (columns 1
and 3 of Table 16). This is true both overall (+0.9) and for …rms with techies (+1.24), and
is consistent with nonmanufacturing …rms that import and have distribution networks.
Compared to …rms that do not export, nonmanufacturing exporters have sharply falling shares
of o¢ ce workers (PCS 54, -0.6), and rising shares of low skill manual workers (PCS 68, +2.4);
comparing column 5 to 7 in Table 16, these e¤ects are even larger among …rms that have
techies (-0.8 and +3.4, respectively).
Given that nonmanufacturing …rms do not engage in much direct international trade, the paucity
of strong results just described is not surprising. In Table 17 we …nd much larger e¤ects of trade
on manufacturing …rms, almost entirely along the extensive margin:
The extensive margin of exporting has a large and positive e¤ect on growth in the share of
managers (PCS 37, +0.4). The e¤ect among …rms with techies is similar in size to the overall
e¤ect, though imprecisely estimated. By contrast, importing has no extensive margin e¤ect
on the PCS 37 share.
There is a strong blue collar skill upgrading e¤ect of importing (column 1): the growth
of skilled industrial and manual laborers (PCS 62 and 63) is much faster (+1.3 and +6.2,
respectively), while growth of unskilled industrial workers is much slower (PCS 67, -3.3).
There is a strong blue collar skill downgrading e¤ect of exporting (column 5): the growth
of skilled industrial and manual laborers (PCS 62 and 63) is much slower (-1.0 and -3.4
respectively) while the share of unskilled industrial workers grows much faster (PCS 67,
+2.1).
40

The e¤ects are similar among manufacturing importers with techies (columns 3 and 7), which
is to be expected, since almost all trading manufacturing …rms employ techies (see Table 8). The
intensive margin e¤ects of trade in manufacturing industries are mostly small and/or statistically
insigni…cant— all the action comes from comparing …rms that do not trade with …rms that do.
For manufacturing …rms, imports are primarily of intermediate inputs, so we have identi…ed the
e¤ects of o¤shoring. The skill upgrading e¤ect of importing is consistent with a simple o¤shoring
story where imported intermediate goods substitute for low-skill workers within manufacturing
…rms, thus raising the skill intensity of the remaining labor force. This is consistent with Biscourp
and Kramarz (2007), who …nd that imports of …nal goods are associated with declines in production workers’ employment, and in particular low-skill production workers’ employment in French
Manufacturing in 1986–1992. It is also what is found by Verhoogen (2008) in Mexican data.49
Our …nding that exporting is associated with faster growth of managers (PCS 37) is not surprising, given the extensive literature that documents a positive correlation between the share of
non-production/white-collar jobs and exporting. What is new and surprising is our …nding that exporting causes skill downgrading within production/blue-collar occupations. Together these results
imply a within-…rm polarizing e¤ect of exporting. Earlier researchers using plant or …rm level data
could not uncover this e¤ect because they did not have information on skill composition within
production/blue-collar workers.
Overall, our results in Tables 17 and 11 support a conclusion that o¤shoring reduces …rm
employment growth, and leads to skill upgrading within blue collar workers.

Econometric Results: Goodness of …t

Our …nal quantitative question is: how much of the within-…rm and between-…rm variation in
occupational change do our econometric models explain? To answer this, we compute two measures.
The …rst is the usual regression R2 , weighted by …rm hours. The second is directly related to the
within-between decomposition of occupational hours share changes given by equation (1). We …rst
compute the “explained within” component from 2002 to 2007 using the …tted values csf ot from

estimation of equation (10), and then divide this by the actual within component for permanent
49

Verhoogen (2008), studies the e¤ects on plant-level quality upgrading in manufacturing in Mexico, following
the large 1994/1995 devaluation of the peso. He proxies worker quality by within-blue collar education levels in
manufacturing.

is the average hours share of …rm f from 2002 to 2007.50 Explained within is an answer

to the question, "what percentage of the within-…rm change in the hours share of occupation o
from 2002 to 2007 is explained by the estimates?". Similarly, we compute the “explained between"
component from 2002 to 2007 using the …tted values gbf t from estimation of equation (6), and then

divide this by the actual between component for permanent …rms from 2002 to 2007,

Table 13 reports the weighted R2 and Explained within goodness of …t statistics for the estimates

of our baseline speci…cation, equation (10). Similarly, Table 7 reports the weighted R2 and Explained
between goodness of …t statistics for the estimates of equation (6). The R2 s are generally very low,
which is to be expected in cross sectional micro data.
The Explained within results are generally weak, with 9 of the 24 being negative, which means
that the regression model predicts an aggregate change opposite in sign to what actually occurred.
Of the 15 positive results, only 5 are greater than 1 percent. The Explained between results in
Table 7 are even weaker, with 10 of the 24 being negative. The inability of the regression model to
explain much of the within-…rm and between-…rm variation is probably a sign of the importance
of both …rm-speci…c random shocks and unmeasured systematic in‡uences on …rms’occupational
choices.
Tables 13 and 7 also report p-values for the null hypothesis that the trade and techie e¤ects are
jointly equal to zero. This null is rejected for equation (10) at conventional signi…cance levels for
all the PCS codes in manufacturing, and for nine of twelve in nonmanufacturing. For equation (6)
this null is rejected for both nonmanufacturing and manufacturing.
50

Since the regression model explains the ex-techie share of occupation o in …rm f , which is weakly greater than
the overall share of o in f , we adjust the …tted values by multiplying them by the average ratio of ex-techie to total
hours for f in the two years.
51
We explain how we approximate c f t by using gbf t in the appendix.

Conclusions

In this paper we use administrative employee-…rm-level data from 1994 to 2007 to show that the
labor market in France has become polarized: employment shares of high and low wage occupations
have grown, while middle wage occupations have shrunk. During the same period, the share of
hours in technology-related occupations (“techies") grew substantially, as did imports and exports,
and we explore the causal links between these trends.
We show that polarization is pervasive: it has occurred within the nonmanufacturing and manufacturing sectors, and both within and between …rms. The importance of between-…rm reallocations
for polarization implies that simple theories of substitution across workers within economic units
miss an important margin of adjustment. The importance of changes in the composition of …rms
for explaining job polarization suggests di¤erential e¤ects of technological change and trade on
relative competitiveness across …rms.
Motivated by the fact that technology adoption is mediated by technically quali…ed managers
and technicians, we develop a novel measure of the propensity to adopt new technology: the …rmlevel employment share of techies. Using the subsample of …rms that are active over the whole
period, we develop an empirical framework that allows us to study the …rm-level e¤ects of falling
ICT prices and the growth of o¤shoring and exporting. To control for the endogeneity of …rm-level
techies and trade in 2002, we use values of techies and trade from 1994 to 1998 as instruments.
Our econometric results show that nonmanufacturing …rms with more techies in 2002 saw
substantial skill upgrading from 2002 to 2007, with the share of hours worked by managers growing
faster and the share worked by o¢ ce and retail workers growing slower. The e¤ect of techies in
manufacturing was polarizing, but di¤ered between …rms that traded and those that did not: …rms
that did not trade saw their share of managers rising faster and blue-collar skill downgrading, while
…rms that traded saw faster growth in middle managers as o¢ ce workers grew more slowly.
Our results also show that …rms with more techies in 2002 saw substantially faster employment
growth in 2002–2007. This is consistent with technological change improving the competitiveness
of these …rms relative to other …rms with no techies in 2002.
Importing by manufacturing …rms caused blue-collar skill upgrading, suggesting that low-skill
blue collar workers saw their tasks replaced by imports. Exporting is found to cause within-…rm
polarization: faster growth in the share of managers and skill downgrading within production

43

workers. O¤shoring also caused slower employment growth in manufacturing, while exporting had
no e¤ect on employment growth.
While our estimated e¤ects of techies and trade are economically large, most of the variation
in within-…rm and between-…rm occupational change is unexplained by these variables. We thus
make no claim that the mechanisms we study in our econometric exercises are the only, or even
dominant, in‡uences on changes in the aggregate occupational mix.
Changes in the occupational structure of employment are an important feature of the world
economy in recent decades, with profound implications for inequality and for the distribution of
gains from technological progress and globalization. Our paper is the …rst to analyze these economywide changes using …rm-level data and causal econometric analysis, which has made it possible to
paint a rich and nuanced portrait of how and why polarization evolved in France between 1994 and
2007.
